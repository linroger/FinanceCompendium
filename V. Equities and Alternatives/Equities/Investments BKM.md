# The Investment Environment

# 1

AN INVESTMENT IS the current commitment of money or other resources in the expectation of reaping future benefits. For example, you might purchase shares of stock anticipating that the future proceeds will justify both the time your money is tied up as well as the risk of the investment. The time you will spend studying this text (not to mention its cost) also is an investment. You are forgoing either current leisure or the income you could be earning at a job in the expectation that your future career will be sufficiently enhanced to justify this commitment of time and effort. While these two investments differ in many ways, they share one key attribute that is central to all investments: You sacrifice something of value now, expecting to reap the benefits later.

This text can help you become an informed practitioner of investments. We will focus on investments in securities such as stocks, bonds, or derivatives contracts, but much of what we discuss will be useful in the analysis of any type of investment. The text will provide you with background in the organization of various securities markets; will survey the valuation and risk management principles useful in particular markets, such as those for bonds or stocks; and will introduce you to the principles of portfolio construction.

Broadly speaking, this chapter addresses several topics that will provide perspective for the material that is to come later. First, before delving into the topic of "investments," we consider the role of financial assets in the economy. We discuss the relationship between securities and the "real" assets that actually produce goods and services for consumers, and we consider why financial assets are important to the functioning of a developed economy.

Given this background, we then take a first look at the types of decisions that confront investors as they assemble a portfolio of assets. These investment decisions are made in an environment where higher returns usually can be obtained only at the price of greater risk and in which it is rare to find assets that are so mispriced as to be obvious bargains. These themes—the risk-return trade-off and the efficient pricing of financial assets—are central to the investment process, so it is worth pausing for a brief discussion of their implications as we begin the text. These implications will be fleshed out in much greater detail in later chapters.

We provide an overview of the organization of security markets as well as its key participants. Finally, we discuss the financial crisis that began playing out in 2007 and peaked in 2008. The crisis dramatically illustrated the connections between the financial system and the "real" side of the economy. We look at the origins of the crisis and the lessons that may be drawn


about systemic risk. We close the chapter with an overview of the remainder of the text.

# 1.1 Real Assets versus Financial Assets

The material wealth of a society is ultimately determined by the productive capacity of its economy, that is, the goods and services its members can create. This capacity is a function of the real assets of the economy: the land, buildings, machines, and knowledge that can be used to produce goods and services.

In contrast to real assets are financial assets such as stocks and bonds. Such securities historically were no more than sheets of paper (and today, are far more likely to be, computer entries), and they do not contribute directly to the productive capacity of the economy. Instead, these assets are the means by which individuals in well-developed economies hold their claims on real assets. Financial assets are claims to the income generated by real assets (or claims on income from the government). If we cannot own our own auto plant (a real asset), we can still buy shares in Ford or Toyota (financial assets) and thereby share in the income derived from the production of automobiles.

While real assets generate net income to the economy, financial assets simply define the allocation of income or wealth among investors. When investors buy securities issued by companies, the firms use the money so raised to pay for real assets, such as plant, equipment, technology, or inventory. So investors' returns ultimately come from the income produced by the real assets that were financed by the issuance of those securities.

# Concept Check 1.1

Are the following assets real or financial?

a. Patents b. Lease obligations
c. Customer goodwill d. A college education
e. A 5 bill

The distinction between real and financial assets is apparent when we compare the balance sheet of U.S. households, shown in Table 1.1, with the composition of national wealth in the United States, shown in Table 1.2. Household wealth includes financial assets such as bank accounts, corporate stock, or bonds. However, these securities, which are financial assets of households, are liabilities of the issuers of the securities. For example, a bond that you treat as an asset because it gives you a claim on interest income and repayment of principal from Toyota is a liability of Toyota, which is obligated to make these payments. Your asset is Toyota's liability. Therefore, when we aggregate over all balance sheets, these claims cancel out, leaving only real assets as the net wealth of the economy. National wealth consists of structures, equipment, inventories of goods, and land.


You might wonder why real assets held by households in Table 1.1 amount to \$44,599 billion, while total real assets in the domestic economy (Table 1.2) are far larger, at \$86,282 billion. A big part of the difference reflects the fact that real assets held by firms, for example, property, plant, and equipment, are included as financial assets of the household sector, specifically through the value of corporate equity and other stock market investments. Also, Table 1.2 includes assets of noncorporate businesses. Finally, there are some differences in valuation methods. For example, equity and stock investments in Table 1.1 are measured by market value, whereas plant and equipment in Table 1.2 are valued at replacement cost.

# Table 1.2

Domestic net worth

We will focus almost exclusively on financial assets. But keep in mind that the successes or failures of these financial assets ultimately depend on the performance of the underlying real assets.

# 1.2 Financial Assets

It is common to distinguish among three broad types of financial assets: fixed income, equity, and derivatives. Fixed-income or debt securities promise either a fixed stream of income or a stream of income determined by a specified formula. For example, a corporate bond typically promises the bondholder a fixed amount of interest each year. Other so-called floating-rate bonds promise payments that depend on current interest rates. For example, a bond may pay an interest rate fixed at 2 percentage points above the rate paid on U.S. Treasury bills. Unless the borrower is declared bankrupt, the payments on these securities are either fixed or determined by formula. For this reason, the investment performance of debt securities typically is least closely tied to the financial condition of the issuer.


Fixed-income securities come in a tremendous variety of maturities and payment provisions. At one extreme, money market securities are short term, highly marketable, and generally of very low risk, for example, U.S. Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit (CDs). In contrast, the fixed-income capital market includes long-term securities such as Treasury bonds, as well as bonds issued by federal agencies, state and local municipalities, and corporations. These bonds range from very safe in terms of default risk (e.g., Treasury securities) to relatively risky (e.g., high-yield or "junk" bonds). They also are designed with extremely diverse provisions regarding payments provided to the investor and protection against the bankruptcy of the issuer. We will take a first look at these securities in Chapter 2 and undertake a more detailed analysis of the debt market in Part Four.

Unlike debt securities, common stock, or equity, represents an ownership share in the corporation. Equityholders are not promised any particular payment. They receive any dividends the firm may pay and have prorated ownership in the real assets of the firm. If the firm is successful, the value of equity will increase; if not, it will decrease. The performance of equity investments, therefore, is tied directly to the success of the firm and its real assets. For this reason, equity investments tend to be riskier than investments in debt securities. Equity markets and equity valuation are the topics of Part Five.

Finally, derivative securities such as options and futures contracts provide payoffs that are determined by the prices of other assets such as bond or stock prices. For example, a call option on a share of Intel stock might turn out to be worthless if Intel's share price remains below a threshold or "exercise" price such as 50 a share, but it can be quite valuable if the stock price rises above that level.^2 Derivative securities are so named because their values derive from the prices of other assets. For example, the value of the call option will depend on the price of Intel stock. Other important derivative securities are futures and swap contracts. We will treat these in Part Six.

Derivatives have become an integral part of the investment environment. One use of derivatives, perhaps the primary use, is to hedge risks or transfer them to other parties. This is done successfully every day, and the use of these securities for risk management is so commonplace that the multitrillion-dollar market in derivative assets is routinely taken for granted. Derivatives also can be used to take highly speculative positions, however. Every so often, one of these positions blows up, resulting in well-publicized losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. While these losses attract considerable attention, they are in fact the exception to the more common use of such securities as risk management tools. Derivatives will continue to play an important role in portfolio construction and the financial system. We will return to this topic later in the text.

Investors and corporations regularly encounter other financial markets as well. Firms engaged in international trade regularly transfer money back and forth between dollars and other currencies. In London alone, over  \$2 trillion of currency is traded each day and worldwide trading volume exceeds\$ 6 trillion.

Investors also might invest directly in some real assets. For example, dozens of commodities are traded on exchanges such as the New York Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade. You can buy or sell corn, wheat, natural gas, gold, silver, and so on.

Commodity and derivative markets allow firms to adjust their exposure to various business risks. For example, a construction firm may lock in the price of copper by buying copper futures contracts, thus eliminating the risk of a jump in the price of its raw materials. Wherever there is uncertainty, investors may be interested in trading, either to speculate or to lay off their risks, and a market may arise to meet that demand.

# 1.3 Financial Markets and the Economy

We stated earlier that real assets determine the wealth of an economy, while financial assets merely represent claims on real assets. Nevertheless, financial assets and the markets in which they trade play several crucial roles in developed economies. Financial assets allow us to make the most of the economy's real assets.

# The Informational Role of Financial Markets

Stock prices reflect investors' collective assessment of a firm's current performance and future prospects. When the market is more optimistic about the firm, its share price will rise. That higher price makes it easier for the firm to raise capital and therefore encourages investment. In this manner, stock prices play a major role in the allocation of capital in market economies, directing it to the firms and applications with the greatest perceived potential. For example, in 2021, big investors poured huge investments into startup firms focusing on new battery technologies that could store energy created by renewables such as wind or solar power. The prospect of big profits if this technology pans out prompted investors to allocate their funds toward these ventures. This dynamic was a good example of market incentives directing capital to applications where there is the prospect of a large payoff.

Do capital markets actually channel resources to the most efficient use? At times, they appear to fail miserably. Companies or whole industries can be "hot" for a period of time (think about the dot-com bubble that peaked and then collapsed in 2000), attract a large flow of investor capital, and then fail after only a few years.

The process seems highly wasteful. But we need to be careful about our standard of efficiency. No one knows with certainty which ventures will succeed and which will fail. It is therefore unreasonable to expect that markets will never make mistakes. The stock market encourages allocation of capital to those firms that appear at the time to have the best prospects. Many smart, well-trained, and well-paid professionals analyze the prospects of firms whose shares trade on the stock market. Stock prices reflect their collective judgment.

You may well be skeptical about resource allocation through markets. But if you are, take a moment to think about the alternatives. Would a central planner make fewer mistakes? Would you prefer that Congress make these decisions? To paraphrase Winston Churchill's comment about democracy, markets may be the worst way to allocate capital except for all the others that have been tried.

# Consumption Timing

Some individuals are earning more than they currently wish to spend. Others, for example, retirees, spend more than they currently earn. How can you shift your purchasing power from high-earnings to low-earnings periods of life? One way is to "store" your wealth in financial assets. In high-earnings periods, you can invest your savings in financial assets such as stocks and bonds. In low-earnings periods, you can sell these assets to provide funds for your consumption needs. By so doing, you can "shift" your consumption over the course of your lifetime, thereby allocating your consumption to periods that provide the greatest satisfaction. Thus, financial markets allow individuals to separate decisions concerning current consumption from constraints that otherwise would be imposed by current earnings.

# Allocation of Risk

Virtually all real assets involve some risk. When Toyota builds its auto plants, for example, it cannot know for sure what cash flows those plants will generate. Financial markets and the diverse financial instruments traded in those markets allow investors with the greatest taste for risk to bear that risk, while other, less risk-tolerant individuals can, to a greater extent, stay on the sidelines. For example, if Toyota raises the funds to build its auto plant by selling both stocks and bonds to the public, the more optimistic or risk-tolerant investors can buy shares of its stock, while the more conservative ones can buy its bonds. Because the bonds promise to provide a fixed payment, the stockholders bear most of the business risk but reap potentially higher rewards. Thus, capital markets allow the risk that is inherent to all investments to be borne by the investors most willing to bear it.

This allocation of risk also benefits the firms that need to raise capital to finance their investments. When investors are able to select security types with the risk-return characteristics that best suit their preferences, each security can be sold for the best possible price. This facilitates the process of building the economy's stock of real assets.

# Separation of Ownership and Management

Many businesses are owned and managed by the same individual. This simple organization is well suited to small businesses and, in fact, was the most common form of business organization before the Industrial Revolution. Today, however, with global markets and large-scale production, the size and capital requirements of firms have skyrocketed. For example, at the end in 2021, Chevron listed on its balance sheet about  \$156 billion of property, plant, and equipment and total assets of\$ 240 billion. Corporations of such size simply cannot exist as owner-operated firms. Chevron actually has tens of thousands of stockholders with an ownership stake in the firm proportional to their holdings of shares.

Such a large group of individuals obviously cannot actively participate in the day-to-day management of the firm. Instead, they elect a board of directors that in turn hires and supervises the management of the firm. This structure means that the owners and managers of the firm are different parties. This gives the firm a stability that the owner-managed firm cannot achieve. For example, if some stockholders decide they no longer wish to hold shares in the firm, they can sell their shares to other investors, with no impact on the management of the firm. Thus, financial assets and the ability to buy and sell those assets in the financial markets allow for easy separation of ownership and management.

How can all of the disparate owners of the firm, ranging from large pension funds holding hundreds of thousands of shares to small investors who may hold only a single share, agree on the objectives of the firm? Financial markets can provide some guidance.

The overwhelming orthodoxy in the business community since the 1970s was that the goal of the firm should be to maximize value and that corporate governance, for example, incentive packages for top management, should be designed to encourage that goal. The idea is that when value is maximized, we will all be in a better position to pursue our personal goals including, if we wish, support for "good causes." But in 2019, America's Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs of the country's largest corporations, advocated for broader corporate goals that address the interests of other stakeholders, including employees, customers, and the communities in which firms operate. Their argument is that firms need to recognize and respond to ethical and societal considerations beyond their private pursuit of profit, in other words, that there is a built-in tension between shareholder capitalism and stakeholder capitalism.

The critics of value maximization argue that it does not provide incentives to firms to respond to important societal and economic challenges and that if firms concern themselves only with their own interests, they will ignore potential value-reducing impacts of their actions on other players. For example, should a firm increase its value by a trivial amount if it thereby increases unemployment for a large number of workers? Should it increase its value by gutting pension plans established for its former employees? Should it increase profits by evading the costs of clean production even if that would pollute the environment? These critics argue that firms should be encouraged and perhaps forced to take a broader view of their obligations to their many stakeholders.

They argue further that enlightened strategies can actually be financially beneficial, and that long-term value maximization requires sustainable investment strategies compatible with a healthier and more resilient economy in the future. These sustainability criteria are commonly grouped under the umbrella of environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, investing. In fact, the ESG sector has exploded in the last few years, with ESG-oriented mutual and exchange-traded funds in the United States capturing about one-fourth of new investments in 2020.

On the other hand, traditionalists are wary of an unfocused commitment to many competing and unspecified interests that could impede accountability. Should the firm, for example, offer a better service to its customers if doing so makes the company a less attractive place to work? Given these sorts of conflicting objectives, how should one judge whether managers have performed well? Who will set these goals, and how much power is it appropriate to give to nonshareholders with little skin in the game? What incentives will remain for innovation and risk taking if corporate goals are set in the political arena? Is it right to downplay the importance of monetary success? After all, many institutions devoted to the public good and the economic security of individuals rely on the success of the endowment funds and pension funds that help pay for their activities. Finally, regardless of their preferences, competition may force firms to pursue value-maximizing strategies—if they don't, they run the risk that competitors who do will put them out of business.


How might one thread this needle? One middle-ground approach focuses on encouraging enlightened self-interest. It can be value maximizing to establish a reputation as a good place to work if that helps the firm attract and retain good employees. It can be value maximizing to avoid scandal, disruption, and fines. It can also be value maximizing to provide products and treat customers in a manner that encourages repeat business. And if customers want goods produced by well-treated workers using environmentally responsible practices, it will be in the firm's interest to design production processes with those goals in mind. Consumers also vote with their feet, and firms that wish to do well may face pressure to do good.

Of course, it would be naive to believe that there will never be conflicts between value maximization, even maximization of long-term value, and other social considerations. Potential conflicts may call for government intervention to nudge incentives in one direction or the other. For example, governments may tax polluting activities to make it value maximizing to reduce emissions. They may set and enforce antitrust rules to foster competition and prevent any one firm from becoming powerful enough to ride roughshod over the interests of customers and employees. They can demand transparency to allow outsiders to make informed judgments of how the company is behaving.

The world is full of slippery slopes and competing goals, and no economic system will at all times and in all places arrive at the best compromise between narrow self-interest and broader social impact. Enlightened capitalism that recognizes that long-term success is compatible with, and in fact may demand, consideration of the wider implications of corporate actions may strike as good a balance as one can hope for.

While the particular goals of each corporation's many investors may vary widely, all shareholders will be better able to achieve those personal goals when the firm acts to enhance the value of their shares. For this reason, value maximization has for decades been widely accepted as a useful organizing principle for the firm. More recently, some observers have questioned this goal, arguing that the firm should attempt to balance the interests of its many stakeholders, for example, employees, customers, suppliers, and communities. The nearby box examines this debate.

Do managers really attempt to maximize firm value? It is easy to see how they might be tempted to engage in activities not in the best interest of shareholders. For example, they might engage in empire building or avoid risky projects to protect their own jobs or over-consume luxuries such as corporate jets, reasoning that the cost of such perquisites is largely borne by the shareholders. These potential conflicts of interest are called agency problems because managers, who are hired as agents of the shareholders, may pursue their own interests instead.

Several mechanisms have evolved to mitigate potential agency problems. First, compensation plans tie the income of managers to the success of the firm. A major part of the total compensation of top executives is often in the form of shares or stock options, which means that the managers will not do well unless the stock price increases, benefiting shareholders. (Of course, we've learned that overuse of options can create its own agency problem. Options can create an incentive for managers to manipulate information to prop up a stock price temporarily, giving them a chance to cash out before the price returns to a level reflective of the firm's true prospects. More on this shortly.) Second, while boards of directors have sometimes been portrayed as defenders of top management, they can, and in recent years, increasingly have, forced out management teams that are underperforming. Third, outsiders such as security analysts and large institutional investors such as mutual funds or pension funds monitor the firm closely and make the life of poor performers at the least uncomfortable. Such large investors today hold about half of the stock in publicly listed firms in the United States.

Finally, bad performers are subject to the threat of takeover. If the board of directors is lax in monitoring management, unhappy shareholders in principle can elect a different board. They can do this by launching a proxy contest in which they seek to obtain enough proxies (i.e., rights to vote the shares of other shareholders) to take control of the firm and vote in another board. Historically, this threat was usually minimal. Shareholders who attempt such a fight have to use their own funds, while management can defend itself using corporate coffers.

However, in recent years, the odds of a successful proxy contest have increased along with the rise of so-called activist investors. These are large and deep-pocketed investors, often hedge funds, that identify firms they believe to be mismanaged in some respect. They buy large positions in shares of those firms and then campaign for slots on the board of directors and/or for specific reforms.

# Example 1.1 Activist Investors and Corporate Control

Here are a few of the better-known activist investors, along with a sample of their more notable initiatives:

- Nelson Peltz, Brian. Brian gained a seat on General Electric's board of directors and pressured the company to cut costs, to return capital to shareholders, for example, through stock buybacks, and to downsize the firm.
William Ackman, Pershing Square. Took  $8.3\%$  stake in software company ADP, where he pushed for management changes.
- Dan Loeb, Third Point. Took large position in Royal Dutch Shell and pressed the company to split into two independent firms, one focusing on its legacy business lines, such as oil exploration and refining, and the other on low-carbon and renewable energy sources.
- Carl Icahn. One of the earliest and most combative of activist investors. Pushed HP to accept a takeover bid made by Xerox.
- Christer Gardell, Cevian Capital. Cevian is the largest activist firm in Europe. In 2021, it built up a  $5\%$  stake in the insurer Avian and then pressured the company to commit to deeper cost reductions and to pay out  $\pounds 5$  billion in dividends or stock repurchases.
Paul Singer, Elliott Management. Built up a large stake in the U.K. drug manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline after GSK's disappointing performance in the development of a Covid vaccination. Elliott is now expected to demand a large say in the firm's future management.
- Engine No. 1. A newcomer to the field, this formerly little-known fund gained the backing of large institutional investors like BlackRock and Vanguard and won three seats on the board of ExxonMobil, filling them with candidates with backgrounds in green energy and operational expertise.

Aside from proxy contests, the real takeover threat is from other firms. If one firm observes another underperforming, it can acquire the underperforming business and replace management with its own team. The stock price should rise to reflect the prospects of improved performance, which provides an incentive for firms to engage in such takeover activity.

# Corporate Governance and Corporate Ethics

We've argued that securities markets can play an important role in facilitating the deployment of capital to the most productive uses. But market signals will help to allocate capital efficiently only if investors are acting on accurate information. We say that markets need to be transparent for investors to make informed decisions. If firms can mislead the public about their prospects, then much can go wrong.

Despite the many mechanisms to align incentives of shareholders and managers, the three years from 2000 through 2002 were filled with a seemingly unending series of scandals that collectively signaled a crisis in corporate governance and ethics. For example, the telecom firm WorldCom overstated its profits by at least  \$3.8 billion by improperly classifying expenses as investments. When the true picture emerged, it resulted in the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, at least until Lehman Brothers smashed that record in 2008. The next-largest U.S. bankruptcy was Enron, which used its now-notorious "special-purpose entities" to move debt off its own books and similarly present a misleading picture of its financial status. Unfortunately, these firms had plenty of company. Other firms such as Rite Aid, HealthSouth, Global Crossing, and Qwest Communications also manipulated and misstated their accounts to the tune of billions of dollars. And the scandals were hardly limited to the United States. Parmalat, the Italian dairy firm, claimed to have a\$ 4.8 billion bank account that turned out not to exist. These episodes suggest that agency and incentive problems are far from solved, and that transparency is far from complete.

Other scandals of that period included systematically misleading and overly optimistic research reports put out by stock market analysts. (Their favorable analysis was traded for the promise of future investment banking business, and analysts were commonly compensated not for their accuracy or insight, but for their role in garnering investment banking business for their firms.) Additionally, initial public offerings were allocated to corporate executives as a quid pro quo for personal favors or the promise to direct future business back to the manager of the IPO.


What about the auditors who were supposed to be the watchdogs of the firms? Here too, incentives were skewed. Recent changes in business practice had made the consulting businesses of these firms more lucrative than the auditing function. For example, Enron's (now-defunct) auditor Arthur Andersen earned more money consulting for Enron than by auditing it. Given Arthur Andersen's incentive to protect its consulting profits, we should not be surprised that it was overly lenient in its auditing work.

In 2002, in response to the spate of ethics scandals, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, commonly referred to as SOX, to tighten the rules of corporate governance and disclosure. For example, the act requires corporations to have more independent directors, that is, more directors who are not themselves managers (or affiliated with managers). The act also requires each CFO to personally vouch for the corporation's accounting statements, provides for an oversight board to oversee the auditing of public companies, and prohibits auditors from providing various other services to clients.

# 1.4 The Investment Process

Investors' portfolios are simply their collections of investment assets. Once a portfolio is established, it is updated or "rebalanced" by selling existing securities and using the proceeds to buy new securities, by investing additional funds to increase the overall size of the portfolio, or by selling securities to decrease the size of the portfolio.

Investment assets can be categorized into broad asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, and so on. Investors make two types of decisions in constructing their portfolios. The asset allocation decision is the choice among these broad asset classes, while the security selection decision is the choice of which particular securities to hold within each asset class.

"Top-down" portfolio construction starts with asset allocation. For example, an individual who currently holds all of his money in a bank account would first decide what proportion of the overall portfolio ought to be moved into stocks, bonds, and so on. In this way, the broad features of the portfolio are established. For example, while the average annual return on the common stock of large firms since 1926 has been about  $12\%$  per year, the average return on U.S. Treasury bills has been less than  $4\%$ . On the other hand, stocks are far riskier, with annual returns (as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 index) that have ranged as low as  $-46\%$  and as high as  $55\%$ . In contrast, T-bills are effectively risk-free: You know what interest rate you will earn when you buy them. Therefore, the decision to allocate your investments to the stock market or to the money market where Treasury bills are traded will have great ramifications for both the risk and the return of your portfolio. A top-down investor first makes this and other crucial asset allocation decisions before turning to the decision of the particular securities to be held in each asset class.

Security analysis involves the valuation of particular securities that might be included in the portfolio. For example, an investor might ask whether Merck or Pfizer is more attractively priced. Both bonds and stocks must be evaluated for investment attractiveness, but valuation is far more difficult for stocks because a stock's performance usually is far more sensitive to the prospects of the issuing firm.

In contrast to top-down portfolio management is a "bottom-up" strategy in which the portfolio is constructed from securities that seem attractively priced without as much concern for the resultant asset allocation. Such a technique can result in unintended bets on one or another sector of the economy. For example, it might turn out that the portfolio ends up with a very heavy representation of firms in one industry, from one part of the country, or with exposure to one source of uncertainty. However, a bottom-up strategy does focus the portfolio on the assets that seem to offer the most attractive investment opportunities.

# 1.5 Markets Are Competitive

Financial markets are highly competitive. Thousands of intelligent and well-backed analysts constantly scour securities markets searching for the best buys. This competition means that we should expect to find few, if any, "free lunches," securities that are so underpriced that they represent obvious bargains. This no-free-lunch proposition has several implications. Let's examine two.

# The Risk-Return Trade-Off

Investors invest for anticipated future returns, but those returns rarely can be predicted precisely. There will almost always be risk associated with investments. Actual or realized returns will almost always deviate from the expected return anticipated at the start of the investment period. For example, in 1931 (the worst calendar year for the market since 1926), the S&P 500 index fell by  $46\%$ . In 1933 (the best year), the index gained  $55\%$ . You can be sure that investors did not anticipate such extreme performance at the start of either of these years.

Naturally, if all else could be held equal, investors would prefer investments with the highest expected return. However, the no-free-lunch rule tells us that all else cannot be equal. If you want higher expected returns, you will have to pay a price in terms of accepting higher investment risk. If any particular asset offered a higher expected return imposing without extra risk, investors would rush to buy it, with the result that its price would be driven up. Individuals considering investing in the asset at the now-higher price will find the investment less attractive. The price will rise until expected return is no more than commensurate with risk. At this point, investors can anticipate a "fair" return relative to the asset's risk, but no more. Similarly,

The "expected" return is not the return investors believe they necessarily will earn, or even their most likely return. It is instead the result of averaging across all possible outcomes, recognizing that some outcomes are more likely than others. It is the average rate of return across possible economic scenarios.

if returns were independent of risk, there would be a rush to sell high-risk assets and their prices would fall. The assets would get cheaper (improving their expected future rates of return) until they eventually were attractive enough to be included again in investor portfolios. We conclude that there should be a risk-return trade-off in the securities markets, with higher-risk assets priced to offer higher expected returns than lower-risk assets.

Of course, this discussion leaves several important questions unanswered. How should one measure the risk of an asset? What should be the quantitative trade-off between risk (properly measured) and expected return? One would think that risk would have something to do with the volatility of an asset's returns, but this guess turns out to be only partly correct. When we mix assets into diversified portfolios, we need to consider the interplay among assets and the effect of diversification on the risk of the entire portfolio. Diversification means that many assets are held in the portfolio so that the exposure to any particular asset is limited. The effect of diversification on portfolio risk, the implications for the proper measurement of risk, and the risk-return relationship are the topics of Part Two. These topics are the subject of what has come to be known as modern portfolio theory. The development of this theory brought two of its pioneers, Harry Markowitz and William Sharpe, Nobel Prizes.

# Efficient Markets

Another implication of the no-free-lunch proposition is that we should rarely expect to find bargains in the security markets. We will spend all of Chapter 11 examining the theory and evidence concerning the hypothesis that financial markets process all available information about securities quickly and efficiently, that is, that the security price usually reflects all the information available to investors concerning its value. According to this hypothesis, as new information about a security becomes available, its price quickly adjusts so that at any time, the security price equals the market consensus estimate of the value of the security. If this were so, there would be neither underpriced nor overpriced securities.

One interesting implication of this "efficient market hypothesis" concerns the choice between active and passive investment-management strategies. Passive management calls for holding highly diversified portfolios without spending effort or other resources attempting to improve investment performance through security analysis. Active management is the attempt to improve performance either by identifying mispriced securities or by timing the performance of broad asset classes—for example, increasing one's commitment to stocks when one is bullish on the stock market. If markets are efficient and prices reflect all relevant information, perhaps it is better to follow passive strategies instead of spending resources in a futile attempt to outguess your competitors in the financial markets.

If the efficient market hypothesis were taken to the extreme, there would be no point in active security analysis; only fools would commit resources to actively analyze securities. Without ongoing security analysis, however, prices eventually would depart from "correct" values, creating new incentives for experts to move in. Therefore, even in environments as competitive as the financial markets, we may observe only near-efficiency, and profit opportunities may exist for especially diligent and creative investors. In Chapter 12, we examine such challenges to the efficient market hypothesis, and this motivates our discussion of active portfolio management in Part Seven. Nevertheless, our discussions of security analysis and portfolio construction generally must account for the likelihood of nearly efficient markets.

# 1.6 The Players

From a bird's-eye view, there would appear to be three major players in the financial markets:

1. Firms are net demanders of capital. They raise capital now to pay for investments in plant and equipment. The income generated by those real assets provides the returns to investors who purchase the securities issued by the firm.
2. Households typically are net suppliers of capital. They purchase the securities issued by firms that need to raise funds.
3. Governments can be borrowers or lenders, depending on the relationship between tax revenue and government expenditures. Since World War II, the U.S. government typically has run budget deficits, meaning that its tax receipts have been less than its expenditures. The government, therefore, has had to borrow funds to cover its budget deficit. Issuance of Treasury bills, notes, and bonds is the major way that the government borrows funds from the public. In contrast, in the latter part of the 1990s, the government enjoyed a short-lived budget surplus and was able to retire some outstanding debt.

Corporations and governments do not sell all or even most of their securities directly to individuals. For example, about half of all stock is held by large financial institutions such as pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and banks. These financial institutions stand between the security issuer (the firm) and the ultimate owner of the security (the individual investor). For this reason, they are called financial intermediaries. Similarly, corporations do not market their own securities to the public. Instead, they hire agents, called investment bankers, to represent them to the investing public. Let's examine the roles of these intermediaries.

# Financial Intermediaries

Households want desirable investments for their savings, yet the small (financial) size of most households makes direct investment difficult. A small investor seeking to lend money to businesses that need to finance investments doesn't advertise in the local newspaper to find a willing and desirable borrower. Moreover, an individual lender would not be able to diversify across borrowers to reduce risk. Finally, an individual lender is not equipped to assess and monitor the credit risk of borrowers.

For these reasons, financial intermediaries have evolved to bring the suppliers of capital (investors) together with the demanders of capital (primarily corporations and the federal government). These financial intermediaries include banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and credit unions. Financial intermediaries issue their own securities to raise funds to purchase the securities of other corporations.

For example, a bank raises funds by borrowing (taking deposits) and lending that money to other borrowers. The spread between the interest rates paid to depositors and the rates charged to borrowers is the source of the bank's profit. In this way, lenders and borrowers do not need to contact each other directly. Instead, each goes to the bank, which acts as an intermediary between the two. The problem of matching lenders with borrowers is solved when each comes independently to the common intermediary.

Financial intermediaries are distinguished from other businesses in that both their assets and their liabilities are overwhelmingly financial. Table 1.3 presents the aggregated balance sheet of commercial banks, one of the largest sectors of financial intermediaries. Notice that the balance sheet includes only very small amounts of real assets. Compare Table 1.3 to the aggregated balance sheet of the nonfinancial corporate sector in Table 1.4, for which

Other examples of financial intermediaries are investment companies, insurance companies, and credit unions. All these firms offer similar advantages in their intermediary role. First, by pooling the resources of many small investors, they are able to lend considerable sums to large borrowers. Second, by lending to many borrowers, intermediaries achieve significant diversification, so they can accept loans that individually might be too risky. Third, intermediaries build expertise through the volume of business they do and can use economies of scale and scope to assess and monitor risk.

Investment companies, which pool and manage the money of many investors, also arise out of economies of scale. Here, the problem is that most household portfolios are not large enough to be spread across a wide variety of securities. In terms of brokerage fees and research costs, purchasing one or two shares of many different firms is very expensive. Mutual funds have the advantage of large-scale trading and portfolio management, while participating investors are assigned a prorated share of the total funds according to the size of their investment. This system gives small investors advantages they are willing to pay for via a management fee to the mutual fund operator.

Investment companies also can design portfolios specifically for large investors with particular goals. In contrast, mutual funds are sold in the retail market, and their investment philosophies are differentiated mainly by strategies that are likely to attract a large number of clients.

Like mutual funds, hedge funds also pool and invest the money of many clients. But they are open only to institutional investors such as pension funds or endowment funds, or to wealthy individuals. They are more likely to pursue complex and higher-risk strategies. They typically keep a portion of trading profits as part of their fees, whereas mutual funds charge a fixed percentage of assets under management.

Economies of scale also explain the proliferation of analytic services available to investors. Newsletters, databases, and brokerage house research services all engage in research to be sold to a large client base. This setup arises naturally. Investors clearly want information, but with small portfolios to manage, they do not find it economical to personally gather all of it. Hence, a profit opportunity emerges: A firm can perform this service for many clients and charge for it.

# Investment Bankers

Just as economies of scale and specialization create profit opportunities for financial intermediaries, these economies also create niches for firms that perform specialized services for businesses. Firms raise much of their capital by selling securities such as stocks and bonds to the public. Because these firms do not do so frequently, however, investment bankers that specialize in such activities can offer their services at a cost below that of maintaining an in-house security issuance division. In this role, they are called underwriters.

Investment bankers advise the issuing corporation on the prices it can charge for the securities issued, appropriate interest rates, and so forth. Ultimately, the investment banking firm handles the marketing of the security in the primary market, where new issues of securities are offered to the public. Later, investors can trade previously issued securities among themselves in the so-called secondary market.

For most of the last century, investment banks and commercial banks in the U.S. were separated by law. While those regulations were effectively eliminated in 1999, the industry

# Separating Commercial Banking from Investment Banking

Until 1999, the Glass-Steagall Act had prohibited banks in the United States from both accepting deposits and underwriting securities. In other words, it forced a separation of the investment and commercial banking industries. But when Glass-Steagall was repealed, many large commercial banks began to transform themselves into "universal banks" that could offer a full range of commercial and investment banking services. In some cases, commercial banks started their own investment banking divisions from scratch, but more frequently they expanded through merger. For example, Chase Manhattan acquired J.P. Morgan to form JPMorgan Chase. Similarly, Citigroup acquired Salomon Smith Barney to offer wealth management, brokerage, investment banking, and asset management services to its clients. Most of Europe had never forced the separation of commercial and investment banking, so their giant banks such as Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and UBS had long been universal banks. Until 2008, however, the standalone investment banking sector in the U.S. remained large and apparently vibrant, including such storied names as Goldman Sachs, Morgan-Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers.

But the industry was shaken to its core in 2008, when several investment banks were beset by enormous losses on their holdings of mortgage-backed securities. In March, on the verge of insolvency, Bear Stearns was merged into JPMorgan Chase. On September 14, 2008, Merrill Lynch, also suffering steep mortgage-related losses, negotiated an agreement to be acquired by Bank of America. The next day, Lehman Brothers entered into the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, having failed to find an acquirer able and willing to rescue it from its steep losses. The next week, the only two remaining major independent investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, decided to convert from investment banks to traditional bank holding companies. In doing so, they became subject to the supervision of national bank regulators such as the Federal Reserve and the far tighter rules for capital adequacy that govern commercial banks. The firms decided that the greater stability they would enjoy as traditional banks, particularly the ability to fund their operations through bank deposits and access to emergency borrowing from the Fed, justified the conversion. These mergers and conversions marked the effective end of the independent investment banking industry—but not of investment banking. Those services are now supplied by the large universal banks.


The debate about the separation between commercial and investment banking that seemed to have ended with the repeal of Glass-Steagall has come back to life. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act places new restrictions on bank activities.

For example, the Volcker Rule, named after former chair of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker, prohibits banks from "proprietary trading," that is, trading securities for their own accounts, and restricts their investments in hedge funds or private equity funds. The rule is meant to limit the risk that banks can take on. While the Volcker Rule is less restrictive than Glass-Steagall had been, they both are motivated by the belief that banks enjoying federal guarantees should be subject to limits on the sorts of activities in which they can engage.

Proprietary trading is a core activity for investment banks, so limitations on this activity for commercial banks reintroduces a separation between these business models. However, these restrictions elicited pushback from the industry, which argued that it resulted in a brain drain of top traders from banks to hedge funds. In 2018, the Dodd-Frank bill was in effect partially repealed when new legislation granted all but the largest banks exemptions from some of its regulations.

known as "Wall Street" until 2008 was still composed of large, independent investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers. But that stand-alone model came to an abrupt end in September 2008, when all the remaining major U.S. investment banks were absorbed into commercial banks, declared bankruptcy, or reorganized as commercial banks. The nearby box presents a brief introduction to these events.

# Venture Capital and Private Equity

While large firms can raise funds directly from the stock and bond markets with help from their investment bankers, smaller and younger firms that have not yet issued securities to the public do not have that option. Start-up companies rely instead on bank loans and investors who are willing to invest in them in return for an ownership stake in the firm. The equity investment in these young companies is called venture capital (VC). Sources of venture capital are dedicated venture capital funds, wealthy individuals known as angel investors, and institutions such as pension funds.

Most venture capital funds are set up as limited partnerships. A management company starts with its own money and raises additional capital from limited partners such as pension funds. That capital may then be invested in a variety of start-up companies.

The management company usually sits on the start-up company's board of directors, helps recruit senior managers, and provides business advice. It charges a fee to the VC fund for overseeing the investments. After some period of time, for example, 10 years, the fund is liquidated and proceeds are distributed to the investors.

Venture capital investors commonly take an active role in the management of a start-up firm. Other active investors may engage in similar hands-on management but focus instead on firms that are in distress or firms that may be bought up, "improved," and sold for a profit. Collectively, these investments in firms that do not trade on public stock exchanges are known as private equity investments.

# Fintech, Financial Innovation, and Decentralized Finance

Surveying the major actors on the financial scene highlighted in this section, it is clear that when the needs of market participants create profit opportunities, markets tend to evolve to provide those desired services. Sometimes, those innovations are spurred by technological advances that make possible previously infeasible products. Fintech is the application of technology to financial markets, and it has changed many aspects of the financial landscape.

While we have focused on financial intermediaries, technology allowing individuals to interact directly has led to some financial disintermediation. This trend toward the elimination of the intermediary has been dubbed decentralized finance or DeFi.

Peer-to-peer lending is a good example of a technology that can be used to link lenders and borrowers directly, without need of an intermediary like a commercial bank. One of the major players in this market is LendingClub, whose Web site allows borrowers to apply for personal loans up to  \$40,000 or business loans up to\$ 300,000. The potential borrower is given a credit score, and then lenders (which the company calls investors) can decide whether to participate in the loan. LendingClub does not itself lend funds; instead, its platform provides information about borrowers and lenders and allows them to interact directly.

Robo Advice While the very wealthy can afford to hire financial advisors, most investors do not have enough assets to justify that inevitably expensive guidance. Robo advisors seek to bring affordable advice to a wide swath of investors. You begin by filling out an online questionnaire about your financial situation and risk tolerance. A computer algorithm then recommends an investment portfolio, which usually will consist of low cost mutual or exchange-traded funds. It may also periodically rebalance your account as the value of each fund fluctuates.

Blockchains We are all accustomed to financial transactions that are recorded in a centralized ledger. For example, your credit card company maintains a record, or database, of all of the purchases and payments you make through its network. Your bank maintains a ledger of deposits and withdrawals. Stock exchanges maintain a ledger of who has bought and sold stocks. These ledgers are centralized in the sense that they are administered by a particular trusted party running and hosting the database. By their nature, they do not allow for anonymity, and they can be targets of hackers. This is why the administrator must be trusted—in terms of both honesty and efficiency.

In contrast, blockchains provide a record of transactions that is distributed over a network of connected computers. No single administrator controls it, so there is no single target for potential hackers to attack. Instead, the network sets up a protocol by which new transactions can be securely added to a public distributed ledger. The identities of each party to the transaction can be masked, allowing for anonymity. The ledger is essentially a list of transactions recorded in a "blockchain," and each transaction results in a time-stamped update to the block. Distributing the blockchain across a dispersed network makes it harder for any hacker to attack its integrity. When the ledger is public, it is difficult to either bypass or manipulate the historical record of agreed-to transactions, and crucially, there is no need for the trusted administrator that lies at the heart of a centralized ledger.


Blockchain technology is most associated with cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin (see following discussion), but it is ideally suited for a wider range of secure digital transactions. For example, they might include secure sharing of medical data or supply chain monitoring. Blockchains are probably best thought of more generally as databases that allow verification of information by a decentralized network of participants. As such, they can play a potentially large role in facilitating decentralized finance, providing data and enabling "smart contracts" in which software can authorize transactions in response to a particular triggering event without human intervention.

Another recent blockchain innovation is the NFT, or non-fungible token, which is proof of ownership of a digital asset such as a digital work of art or even an original video of a sports event.

Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies, for example, Bitcoin or Ethereum, use blockchain technology to create payment systems that bypass traditional channels such as credit cards, debit cards, or checks. This alternative system offers greater security and anonymity for financial transactions. Bitcoin was introduced in 2009, but it has since been joined by many other digital currencies; in 2021, there were approximately 4,000 different cryptocurrencies. But many of these have essentially no or negligible trading volume and almost all are far smaller (in terms of total outstanding value) than Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Cryptocurrency's promise as an alternative to traditional currencies and payment systems still remains unclear. One challenge is price volatility, making it a problematic store of value. In 2021, for example, the dollar value of one bitcoin ranged from below  \$30,000 to more than\$ 63,000. Another challenge is that transactions require enormous amounts of costly energy for the computers that validate those transactions. Moreover, the rate at which transactions can be validated remains miniscule compared to that offered by the traditional credit card network. These problems limit the efficacy of cryptocurrency as a means of exchange.

A more recent innovation in this regard is the stablecoin. This is a cryptocurrency that the issuer pledges to redeem for a conventional currency (e.g., the U.S. dollar) on demand. The largest stablecoin today is Tether. Stable-dollar cryptocurrencies typically are backed by holdings of dollars, often held by a third-party custodian, which ensures the ability to convert into dollars. In other cases, the collateral might be other assets or cryptocurrencies, but that generally requires overcollaterization to compensate for the risk of fluctuations in the value of the collateral. Without adequate collateralization, stable coins are vulnerable to "runs" in which a wave of investors attempt to withdraw their money at once. The Fed and other regulators have expressed concern with the potential for runs and are considering new regulatory approaches to limit that risk.

Governments are also concerned about the use of anonymous transactions to avoid taxes, enable trade in illegal items, or facilitate ransomware and have begun to step up their regulation of these markets. Notwithstanding these challenges, the technology is still new, and enthusiasts predict it will upend today's financial landscape, allowing participants to avoid the fees and costs of dealing with more traditional centralized exchanges.

Digital tokens A variation on cryptocurrency is the digital token issued in an initial coin offering, or ICO. The ICO is a source of crowdfunding in which start-up firms raise cash by selling digital tokens. The token is a form of cryptocurrency that can eventually be used to purchase products or services from the start-up. However, once issued, the coins can be bought or sold among investors like other digital currencies, thus allowing for speculation on their value. Given this potential, some have argued that these coins are in fact securities issued by the firm, and thus should be subject to SEC regulation. Some countries, for example China and South Korea, have banned ICOs altogether. It seems safe to predict that the legal status of these coins will evolve considerably in coming years.

Digital currency As cryptocurrencies have become more familiar, sovereign governments have begun to contemplate developing digital currencies issued by their own central banks. For example, a government might pay tax refunds directly into its citizen's digital wallets (rather than mailing checks or arranging for direct deposit into a conventional bank account). Similarly, citizens could pay bills by transferring funds from their wallets directly into those of their creditors. Like cryptocurrencies, this system would bypass the traditional financial system, as well as its associated fees and relatively slow clearing mechanisms. But unlike them, it would not be subject to the problem of fluctuating value. China is already running trials of a digital yuan, and the Fed announced in 2021 that it would study the feasibility of a digital currency for the United States. Some of the major unanswered questions for digital currency surround security, privacy, and government access to financial activity. Nevertheless, it seems possible that digital currencies will soon become part of the financial landscape.

# 1.7 The Financial Crisis of 2008-2009

This chapter has laid out the broad outlines of the financial system, as well as some of the links between the financial side of the economy and the "real" side in which goods and services are produced. The financial crisis of 2008 illustrated in a painful way the intimate ties between these two sectors. We present in this section a capsule summary of the crisis, attempting to draw some lessons about the role of the financial system as well as the causes and consequences of what has become known as systemic risk. Some of these issues are complicated; we consider them briefly here but will return to them in greater detail later in the text once we have more context for analysis.

# Antecedents of the Crisis

In early 2007, most observers thought it inconceivable that within two years, the world financial system would be facing its worst crisis since the Great Depression. At the time, the economy seemed to be marching from strength to strength. The last significant macroeconomic threat had been from the implosion of the high-tech bubble in 2000-2002. But the Federal Reserve responded to an emerging recession by aggressively reducing interest rates. Figure 1.1 shows that Treasury bill rates dropped drastically between 2001 and 2004, and the LIBOR rate, which was the interest rate at which major money-center banks at the time loaned to each other, fell in tandem. These actions appeared to have been successful, and the recession was short-lived and mild.

Figure 1.1 Short-term LIBOR and Treasury-bill rates and the TED spread

By mid-decade the economy was apparently healthy once again. Although the stock market had declined substantially between 2001 and 2002, Figure 1.2 shows that it reversed direction just as dramatically beginning in 2003, fully recovering all of its post-tech-meltdown losses within a few years. Of equal importance, the banking sector seemed healthy. The spread between the LIBOR rate (at which banks borrow from each other) and the Treasury-bill rate (at which the U.S. government borrows), a common measure of credit risk in the banking sector (often referred to as the TED spread, was only around .25\% in early 2007 (see the bottom curve in Figure 1.1), suggesting that fears of default or "counterparty" risk in the banking sector were extremely low.

Indeed, the apparent success of monetary policy in this recession, as well as in the last 30 years more generally, had engendered a new term, the "Great Moderation," to describe the fact that recent business cycles—and recessions in particular—seemed so mild compared to past experience. Some observers wondered whether we had entered a golden age for macroeconomic policy in which the business cycle had been tamed.

The combination of dramatically reduced interest rates and an apparently stable economy fed a historic boom in the housing market. Figure 1.3 shows that U.S. housing prices began rising noticeably in the late 1990s and accelerated dramatically after 2001 as interest rates plummeted. In the 10 years beginning in 1997, average prices in the U.S. approximately tripled.

But the newfound confidence in the power of macroeconomic policy to reduce risk, the impressive recovery of the economy from the high-tech implosion, and particularly the housing price boom following the aggressive reduction in interest rates may have sown the seeds for the debacle that played out in 2008. On the one hand, the Fed's policy of reducing interest rates had resulted in low yields on a wide variety of investments, and investors were hungry for higher-yielding alternatives. On the other hand, low volatility and optimism about macroeconomic prospects encouraged greater tolerance for risk in the search for these higher-yielding investments. Nowhere was this more evident than in the exploding market for securitized mortgages.

# Changes in Housing Finance

Prior to 1970, most mortgage loans would come from a local lender such as a neighborhood savings bank or credit union. A homeowner would borrow funds for a home purchase and repay the loan over a long period, commonly 30 years. A typical thrift institution would have as its major asset a portfolio of these long-term home loans, while its major liability would be the accounts of its depositors. This landscape began to change when Fannie Mae (FNMA, or Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC, or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) began buying mortgage loans from originators and bundling them into large pools that could be traded like any other financial asset. These pools, which were essentially claims on the underlying mortgages, were soon dubbed mortgage-backed securities, and the process was called securitization. Fannie and Freddie quickly became the behemoths of the mortgage market, between them buying around half of all mortgages originated by the private sector.


Figure 1.4 illustrates how cash flows passed from the original borrower to the ultimate investor in a mortgage-backed security. The loan originator, for example, the savings and loan, might make a 100,000 home loan to a homeowner. The homeowner would repay principal and interest (P&I) on the loan over 30 years. But then the originator would sell the mortgage to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae and recover the cost of the loan. The originator could continue to service the loan (collect monthly payments from the homeowner) for a small servicing fee, but the loan payments net of that fee would be passed along to the agency. In turn, Freddie or Fannie would pool the loans into mortgage-backed securities and sell the securities to investors such as pension funds or mutual funds. The agency (Fannie or Freddie) typically would guarantee the credit or default risk of the loans included in each pool, for which it would retain a guarantee fee before passing along the rest of the cash flow to the ultimate investor. Because the mortgage cash flows were passed along from the homeowner to the lender to Fannie or Freddie to the investor, the mortgage-backed securities were also called pass-throughs.

Until the last decade, the vast majority of securitized mortgages were held or guaranteed by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. These were low-risk conforming mortgages, meaning that eligible loans for agency securitization couldn't be too big, and homeowners had to meet underwriting criteria establishing their ability to repay the loan. For example, the ratio of loan amount to house value could be no more than  $80\%$ . But securitization gave rise to a new market niche for mortgage lenders: the "originate to distribute" (versus originate to hold) business model.

Whereas conforming loans were pooled almost entirely through Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, once the securitization model took hold, it created an opening for a new product: securitization by private firms of nonconforming "subprime" loans with higher default risk. One important difference between the government agency pass-throughs and these so-called private-label pass-throughs was that the investor in the private-label pool would bear the risk that homeowners might default on their loans. Thus, originating mortgage brokers had little incentive to perform due diligence on the loan as long as the loans could be sold to an investor. These investors, of course, had no direct contact with the borrowers, and they could not perform detailed underwriting concerning loan quality. Instead, they relied on borrowers' credit scores, which steadily came to replace conventional underwriting.

Figure 1.4 Cash flows in a mortgage pass-through security


A strong trend toward low-documentation and then no-documentation loans, entailing little verification of a borrower's ability to carry a loan, soon emerged. Other subprime underwriting standards quickly deteriorated. For example, allowed leverage on home loans rose dramatically. When housing prices began falling, these loans were quickly "underwater," meaning that the house was worth less than the loan balance, and many homeowners decided to walk away from their loans.

Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) also grew in popularity. These loans offered borrowers low initial or "teaser" interest rates, but these rates eventually would reset to current market interest yields, for example, the Treasury bill rate plus  $3\%$ . Many of these borrowers "maxed out" their borrowing capacity at the teaser rate, yet, as soon as the loan rate was reset, their monthly payments would soar.

Despite these obvious risks, the ongoing increase in housing prices over the last decade seemed to lull many investors into complacency, with a widespread belief that continually rising home prices would bail out poorly performing loans. But starting in 2004, the ability of refinancing to save a loan began to diminish. First, higher interest rates put payment pressure on homeowners who had taken out adjustable-rate mortgages. Second, as Figure 1.3 shows, housing prices peaked by 2006, so homeowners' ability to refinance a loan using built-up equity in the house declined. Mortgage default rates began to surge in 2007. The crisis was ready to shift into high gear.

# Mortgage Derivatives

One might ask: Who was willing to buy all of these risky subprime mortgages? Securitization, restructuring, and credit enhancement provide a big part of the answer. New risk-shifting tools enabled investment banks to carve out AAA-rated securities from original-issue "junk" loans. Collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, were among the most important and eventually damaging of these innovations.

CDOs were designed to concentrate the credit (i.e., default) risk of a bundle of loans on one class of investors, leaving the other investors in the pool relatively protected from that risk. The idea was to prioritize claims on loan repayments by dividing the pool into senior versus junior slices, called tranches. The senior tranches had first claim on repayments from the entire pool. Junior tranches would be paid only after the senior ones had received their cut. For example, if a pool were divided into two tranches, with  $70\%$  of the pool allocated to the senior tranche and  $30\%$  allocated to the junior one, the senior investors would be repaid in full as long as  $70\%$  or more of the loans in the pool performed, that is, as long as the default rate on the pool remained below  $30\%$ . Even with pools composed of risky subprime loans, default rates above  $30\%$  seemed extremely unlikely, and thus senior tranches were frequently granted the highest (i.e., AAA) rating by the major credit rating agencies, Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch. Large amounts of AAA-rated securities were thus carved out of pools of low-rated mortgages. (We will describe CDOs in more detail in Chapter 14.)

Of course, we know now that these ratings were wrong. The senior-subordinated structure of CDOs provided less protection to senior tranches than investors anticipated. When housing prices across the entire country began to fall, defaults in all regions increased, and the hoped-for benefits from spreading risks geographically never materialized.


Why had the rating agencies so dramatically underestimated credit risk in these subprime securities? First, default probabilities had been estimated using historical data from an unrepresentative period characterized by a housing boom and an uncommonly prosperous and recession-free macroeconomy. Moreover, the ratings analysts had extrapolated historical default experience to a new sort of borrower pool—one without down payments, with exploding-payment loans, and with low- or no-documentation loans (often called liar loans). Past default experience was largely irrelevant given these profound changes in the market. Moreover, the purported power of cross-regional diversification to minimize risk engendered excessive optimism.

Finally, agency problems became apparent. The ratings agencies were paid to provide ratings by the issuers of the securities—not the purchasers. They faced pressure from the issuers, who could shop around for the most favorable treatment, to provide generous ratings.

# Concept Check 1.2

When Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae pooled mortgages into securities, they guaranteed the underlying mortgage loans against homeowner defaults. In contrast, there were no guarantees on the mortgages pooled into subprime mortgage-backed securities, so investors were the ones bearing the credit risk. Were either of these arrangements necessarily a better way to manage and allocate default risk?

# Credit Default Swaps

In parallel to the CDO market, the market in credit default swaps also exploded in this period. A credit default swap, or CDS, is in essence an insurance contract against the default of one or more borrowers. (We will describe these in more detail in Chapter 14.) The purchaser of the swap pays an annual premium (like an insurance premium) for protection from credit risk. Credit default swaps became an alternative method of credit enhancement, seemingly allowing investors to buy subprime loans and insure their safety. But in practice, some swap issuers ramped up their exposure to credit risk to unsupported levels, without sufficient capital to back those obligations. For example, the large insurance company AIG alone sold more than 400 billion of CDS contracts on subprime mortgages.

# The Rise of Systemic Risk

By 2007, the financial system displayed several troubling features. Many large banks and related financial institutions had adopted an apparently profitable financing scheme: borrowing short term at low interest rates to finance holdings in higher-yielding, long-term illiquid assets.[8] But this business model was precarious: By relying primarily on short-term loans for their funding, these firms needed to constantly refinance their positions (i.e., borrow additional funds as the loans matured), or else face the necessity of quickly selling off their less-liquid asset portfolios, which would be difficult in times of financial stress. Moreover, these institutions were highly leveraged and had little capital as a buffer against losses. Even small portfolio losses could drive their net worth negative, at which point no one would be willing to renew outstanding loans or extend new ones.


Another source of fragility was widespread investor reliance on "credit enhancement" through products like CDOs. Many of the assets underlying these pools were illiquid, hard to value, and highly dependent on forecasts of future performance of other loans. In a widespread downturn, with rating downgrades, these assets would prove difficult to sell.

This new financial model was brimming with systemic risk, a potential breakdown of the financial system when problems in one market spill over and disrupt others. When lenders such as banks have limited capital and are afraid of further losses, they may rationally choose to hoard their capital instead of lending it to customers such as small firms, thereby exacerbating funding problems for their customary borrowers.

# The Shoe Drops

By fall 2007, housing price declines were widespread (Figure 1.3), mortgage delinquencies increased, and the stock market entered its own free fall (Figure 1.2). Many investment banks, which had large investments in mortgages, also began to totter.

The crisis peaked in September 2008. On September 7, the giant federal mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which had taken large positions in subprime mortgage-backed securities, were put into conservatorship. (We will have more to say on their travails in Chapter 2.) The failure of these two mainstays of the U.S. housing and mortgage finance industries threw financial markets into a panic. By the second week of September, it was clear that both Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch were on the verge of bankruptcy. On September 14, Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America, again with the benefit of government brokering and protection against losses. The next day, Lehman Brothers, which was denied equivalent treatment, filed for bankruptcy protection. Two days later, on September 17, the government reluctantly lent 85 billion to AIG, reasoning that its failure would have been highly destabilizing to the banking industry, which was holding massive amounts of its credit guarantees (i.e., CDS contracts).

A particularly devastating fallout of the Lehman bankruptcy was on the "money market" for short-term lending. Lehman had borrowed considerable funds by issuing very short-term debt, called commercial paper. Among the major customers in commercial paper were money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, high-quality debt of commercial borrowers. When Lehman faltered, the Reserve Primary Money Market Fund, which was holding large amounts of (AAA-rated!) Lehman commercial paper, suffered investment losses that drove the value of its assets below 1 per share.[9] Fears spread that other funds were similarly exposed, and money market fund customers across the country rushed to withdraw their funds. The funds in turn rushed out of commercial paper into safer and more liquid Treasury bills, essentially shutting down short-term financing markets.

The freezing up of credit markets was the end of any dwindling possibility that the financial crisis could be contained to Wall Street. Larger companies that had relied on the commercial paper market were now unable to raise short-term funds. Banks similarly found it difficult to raise funds. (Look back to Figure 1.1, where you will see that the TED spread, a measure of bank insolvency fears, skyrocketed in 2008.) With banks unwilling or unable to extend credit to their customers, thousands of small businesses that relied on bank lines of credit also became unable to finance their normal business operations. Capital-starved companies were forced to scale back their own operations precipitously. The unemployment rate rose rapidly, and the economy was in its worst recession in decades. The turmoil in the financial markets had spilled over into the real economy, and Main Street had joined Wall Street in a bout of protracted misery.


The crisis was not limited to the United States. Housing markets throughout the world fell, and many European banks had to be rescued by their governments, which were themselves heavily in debt. As the cost of the bank bailouts mounted, the ability of these governments to repay their own debts came into doubt. In this way, the banking crisis spiraled into a sovereign debt crisis.

Greece was the hardest hit. Its government debt of about  \$460 billion was considerably more than its annual GDP. In 2011 it defaulted on debts totaling around\$ 130 billion, eventually requiring a series of rescue packages from the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.

# The Dodd-Frank Reform Act

The crisis engendered many calls for reform of Wall Street. These eventually led to the passage in 2010 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which contains several mechanisms to mitigate systemic risk.

The act calls for stricter rules for bank capital, liquidity, and risk management practices, especially as banks become larger and their potential failure would be more threatening to other institutions. With more capital supporting banks, the potential for one insolvency to trigger another should be contained. In fact, bank capital levels are higher today than they were before the crisis.

In a related measure, the act requires large banks to undergo annual stress tests, which simulate whether the bank has enough capital to withstand specific episodes of economic duress, for example, a major recession, a large increase in interest rates, or a severe decline in liquidity. So far, additional required capital as well as more conservative lending and investing practices has resulted in improved risk exposure.

Dodd-Frank also attempts to limit the risky activities in which banks can engage. The so-called Volcker Rule, named after former chair of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker, prohibits banks from trading for their own accounts and limits total investments in hedge funds or private equity funds.

The incentives of the bond rating agencies are also a sore point. Few are happy with a system that has the ratings agencies paid by the firms they rate. The act creates an Office of Credit Ratings within the Securities and Exchange Commission to oversee the credit rating agencies.

Recent legislation has resulted in a partial rollback of the Dodd-Frank Act. In 2018 Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, exempting most small to medium-sized banks from Dodd-Frank rules, including stress tests. Some large banks (but not the largest) are no longer deemed "systemically important," which brings about closer oversight and higher capital requirements. The 2018 act also exempts smaller banks from the Volcker Rule. Dodd-Frank remains under attack by some members of Congress, and future pullbacks are certainly possible. Regardless of these possible revisions, the crisis surely made clear the essential role of the financial system in the functioning of the real economy.

# 1.8 Outline of the Text

The text has seven parts, which are fairly independent and may be studied in a variety of sequences. Part One is an introduction to financial markets, instruments, and trading of securities. This part also describes the mutual fund industry.

Parts Two and Three contain the core of what has come to be known as "modern portfolio theory." We start in Part Two with a general discussion of risk and return and the lessons of capital market history. We then focus more closely on how to describe investors' risk preferences and progress to asset allocation, efficient diversification, and portfolio optimization.

In Part Three, we investigate the implications of portfolio theory for the equilibrium relationship between risk and return. We introduce the capital asset pricing model, its implementation using index models, and more advanced models of risk and return. This part also treats the efficient market hypothesis as well as behavioral critiques of theories based on investor rationality and closes with a chapter on empirical evidence concerning security returns.

Parts Four through Six cover security analysis and valuation. Part Four is devoted to debt markets and Part Five to equity markets. Part Six covers derivative assets such as options and futures contracts.

Part Seven is an introduction to active investment management. It shows how different investors' objectives and constraints can lead to a variety of investment policies. This part discusses the role of investment management in nearly efficient markets and considers how one should evaluate the performance of managers who pursue active strategies. It also shows how the principles of portfolio construction can be extended to the international setting and examines the hedge fund industry.

1. Real assets create wealth. Financial assets represent claims to parts or all of that wealth. Financial assets determine how the ownership of real assets is distributed among investors.
2. Financial assets can be categorized as fixed income, equity, or derivative instruments. Top-down portfolio construction techniques start with the asset allocation decision—the allocation of funds across broad asset classes—and then progress to more specific security-selection decisions.
3. Competition in financial markets leads to a risk-return trade-off, in which securities that offer higher expected rates of return also impose greater risks on investors. The presence of risk, however, implies that actual returns can differ considerably from expected returns at the beginning of the investment period. Competition among security analysts also promotes financial markets that are nearly informationally efficient, meaning that prices reflect all available information concerning the value of the security. Passive investment strategies may make sense in nearly efficient markets.
4. Financial intermediaries pool investor funds and invest them. Their services are in demand because small investors cannot efficiently gather information, diversify, and monitor portfolios. The financial intermediary sells its own securities to the small investors. The intermediary invests the funds thus raised, uses the proceeds to pay back the small investors, and profits from the difference (the spread).
5. Investment banking brings efficiency to corporate fund-raising. Investment bankers develop expertise in pricing new issues and in marketing them to investors. By the end of 2008, all the major stand-alone U.S. investment banks had been absorbed into commercial banks or had reorganized themselves into bank holding companies. In Europe, where universal banking had never been prohibited, large banks had long maintained both commercial and investment banking divisions.

6. The financial crisis of 2008 demonstrated the importance of systemic risk. Systemic risk can be limited by transparency that allows traders and investors to assess the risk of their counterparties; capital requirements to prevent trading participants from being brought down by potential losses; frequent settlement of gains or losses to prevent losses from accumulating beyond an institution's ability to bear them; incentives to discourage excessive risk taking; and accurate and unbiased analysis by those charged with evaluating security risk.

2. The central issue is the incentive and ability to monitor the quality of loans when originated as well as over time. Freddie and Fannie clearly had incentive to monitor the quality of conforming loans that they had guaranteed, and their ongoing relationships with mortgage originators gave them opportunities to evaluate track records over extended periods of time. In the subprime mortgage market, the ultimate investors in the securities (or the CDOs backed by those securities), who were bearing the credit risk, should not have been willing to invest in loans with a disproportionate likelihood of default. If they properly understood their exposure to default risk, then the (correspondingly low) prices they would have been willing to pay for these securities would have imposed discipline on the mortgage originators and servicers. The fact that they were willing to hold such large positions in these risky securities suggests that they did not appreciate the extent of their exposure. Maybe they were led astray by overly optimistic projections for housing prices or by biased assessments from the credit-reporting agencies. In principle, either arrangement for default risk could have provided the appropriate discipline on the mortgage originators; in practice, however, the informational advantages of Freddie and Fannie probably made them the better "recipients" of default risk. The lesson is that information and transparency are some of the preconditions for well-functioning markets.

# Asset Classes and Financial Instruments

# 2

YOU LEARNED IN Chapter 1 that the process of building an investment portfolio usually begins by deciding how much money to allocate to broad classes of assets, such as safe money market securities or bank accounts, longer term bonds, stocks, or even asset classes like real estate or precious metals. This process is called asset allocation. Within each class the investor then selects specific assets from a more detailed menu. This is called security selection.

Each broad asset class contains many specific security types, and the many variations on a theme can be overwhelming. Our goal in this chapter is to introduce you to the important features of broad classes of securities. Toward this end, we organize our tour of financial instruments according to asset class.

Financial markets are traditionally segmented into money markets and capital markets. Money market instruments include short-term, marketable, liquid, low-risk debt securities. Money market instruments sometimes are called cash equivalents, or just cash for short. Capital markets, in contrast, include longer term and riskier securities. Securities in the capital market are much more diverse than those found within the money market. For this reason, we will subdivide the capital market into four segments: longer term bond markets, equity markets, and the derivative markets for options and futures.


We first describe money market instruments. We then move on to debt and equity securities. We explain the structure of various stock market indexes in this chapter because market benchmark portfolios play an important role in portfolio construction and evaluation. Finally, we survey the derivative security markets for options, futures, and swap contracts.

# 2.1 The Money Market

The money market consists of very short-term, highly marketable debt securities. Many of these securities trade in large denominations and so are out of the reach of individual investors. Money market funds, however, are easily accessible to small investors.

# Treasury Bills

U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills, or just bills, for short) are the most marketable of all money market instruments. The government borrows money by selling bills to the public. Investors buy the bills at a discount from the stated maturity (equivalently, face) value. At maturity, the government pays the investor the face value of the bill. The difference between the purchase price and ultimate maturity value constitutes the interest paid on the bills.

T-bills are issued with initial maturities of 4, 13, 26, or 52 weeks. Individuals can purchase them directly, at auction, or on the secondary market from a government securities dealer. T-bills are highly liquid; that is, they are easily converted to cash and sold at low transaction cost and with minimal price risk. Unlike most other money market instruments, which sell in minimum denominations of  \$100,000, T-bills sell in minimum denominations of only\$ 100, although 10,000 denominations are far more common. Earnings on T-bills are exempt from state and local taxes, another characteristic distinguishing them from other money market instruments.

Figure 2.1 is a partial listing of T-bill rates. Rather than providing prices of each bill, the financial press reports yields based on those prices. You will see yields corresponding to both bid and ask prices. The ask price is the price you would have to pay to buy a T-bill from a securities dealer. The bid price is the slightly lower price you would receive if you wanted to sell a bill to a dealer. The bid-ask spread is the difference in these prices, which is the dealer's source of profit.

The first two yields in Figure 2.1 are reported using the bank-discount method. This means that the bill's discount from its maturity or face value is "annualized" based on a 360-day year, and then reported as a percentage of face value. For example, for the highlighted bill maturing on November 18, 2021, there are 127 days to maturity, and the yield under the column labeled "ASKED" is given as .045\%. This means that a dealer was willing to sell the bill at a discount from face value of .045\% × (127/360) = .0159\%. So a bill with \$10,000 face value could be purchased for \$10,000 × (1 - .000159) = 9,998.41. To summarize, the price of the bill as a fraction of face value is

$$
\text {A s k p r i c e} = 1 - \text {A S K E D} \times \frac {\text {D a y s u n t i l m a t u r i t y}}{3 6 0}
$$ where the ASKED yield is expressed as a decimal (not as a percent). Similarly, with a BID yield of .055\%, a dealer would be willing to purchase the bill for  $10,000 \times (1 - .00055 \times 127 / 360) = \$ 9,998.06. $Notice that because prices and yields are inversely related, the higher bid yield reported in Figure 2.1 implies a lower bid price.$


Figure 2.1 Treasury bill yields

Source: Wall Street Journal Online, July 14, 2021.

The bank discount method for computing yields has a long tradition, but it is flawed for at least two reasons. First, it assumes that the year has only 360 days. Second, it computes the yield as a fraction of par value rather than of the price the investor paid to acquire the bill. An investor who buys the bill for the ask price and holds it until maturity will see that investment grow over 127 days by a multiple of 10,000 / \9,998.41 = 1.000159, for a gain of .0159\%. Annualizing this gain using a 365-day year results in a yield of .0159\% \times 365/127 = .0457\%, which aside from minor rounding error, is the value reported in the last column under "ASKED YIELD." This last value is called the Treasury-bill's bond-equivalent yield.

# Certificates of Deposit

A certificate of deposit, or CD, is a time deposit with a bank. Time deposits (in contrast to "demand deposits" or checking accounts) may not be withdrawn on demand. The bank pays interest and principal to the depositor only at maturity. CDs issued in denominations greater than  \$100,000 are usually negotiable, however; that is, they can be sold to another investor if the owner needs to cash in the certificate before it matures. Short-term CDs are highly marketable, although the market significantly thins out for maturities of three months or more. CDs are treated as bank deposits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, so they are insured for up to\$ 250,000 in the event of a bank insolvency.

# Commercial Paper

Large, well-known companies often issue their own short-term unsecured debt notes rather than borrow directly from banks. These notes are called commercial paper. Very often, commercial paper is backed by a bank line of credit, which gives the borrower access to cash that can be used (if needed) to pay off the paper at maturity.

Commercial paper maturities range up to 270 days, but most often, it is issued with a maturity of less than one or two months, usually in multiples of 100,000. Therefore, small investors can invest in commercial paper only indirectly, via money market mutual funds.

Commercial paper is considered to be a fairly safe asset because a firm's condition presumably can be monitored and predicted over a term as short as one month.

While most commercial paper is issued by nonfinancial firms, in the years leading up to the financial crisis, there was a sharp increase in asset-backed commercial paper issued by financial firms such as banks. This was short-term commercial paper typically used to raise funds for the issuing firm to invest in other assets, most notoriously, subprime mortgages. These assets were in turn used as collateral for the commercial paper—hence the label "asset backed." This practice led to many difficulties starting in the summer of 2007 when the subprime mortgagors began defaulting. The banks found themselves unable to issue new commercial paper to refinance their positions as the old paper matured.

# Bankers' Acceptances

A banker's acceptance starts as an order to a bank by a bank's customer to pay a sum of money at a future date, typically within six months. At this stage, it is similar to a post-dated check. When the bank endorses the order for payment as "accepted," it assumes responsibility for ultimate payment to the holder of the acceptance. At this point, the acceptance may be traded in secondary markets like any other claim on the bank. Bankers' acceptances are considered very safe because traders can substitute the bank's credit standing for their own. They are used widely in foreign trade where the creditworthiness of one trader is unknown to the trading partner. Acceptances sell at a discount from the face value of the payment order, just as T-bills sell at a discount from face value.


# Eurodollars

Eurodollars are dollar-denominated deposits at foreign banks or foreign branches of American banks. By locating outside the United States, these banks escape regulation by the Federal Reserve. Despite the tag “Euro,” these accounts need not be in European banks, although that is where the practice of accepting dollar-denominated deposits outside the United States began.

Most Eurodollar deposits are for large sums, and most are time deposits of less than six months' maturity. A Eurodollar certificate of deposit resembles a domestic bank CD except that it is the liability of a non-U.S. branch of a bank. Firms also issue Eurodollar bonds, which are dollar-denominated bonds outside the United States, although bonds are not considered part of the money market because of their long maturities.

# Repos and Reverses

Dealers in government securities use repurchase agreements, also called "repos" or "RPs," as a form of short-term, usually overnight, borrowing. The dealer sells government securities to an investor on an overnight basis, with an agreement to buy back those securities the next day at a slightly higher price. The increase in the price is the overnight interest. The dealer thus takes out a one-day loan from the investor, and the securities serve as collateral.

A term repo is essentially an identical transaction, except that the term of the implicit loan can be 30 days or more. Repos are considered very safe in terms of credit risk because the loans are backed by the government securities. A reverse repo is the mirror image of a repo. Here, the dealer finds an investor holding government securities and buys them, agreeing to sell them back at a specified higher price on a future date.

# Federal Funds

Just as most of us maintain deposits at banks, banks maintain deposits of their own at a Federal Reserve bank. Each member bank of the Federal Reserve System, or "the Fed," is required to maintain a minimum balance in a reserve account with the Fed. The required balance depends on the total deposits of the bank's customers. Funds in the bank's reserve account are called federal funds, or fed funds. At any time, some banks have more funds than required at the Fed. Other banks, primarily big banks in New York and other financial centers, tend to have a shortage. Banks with excess funds lend to those with a shortage. These loans, which are usually overnight transactions, are arranged at a rate of interest called the federal funds rate.

Although the fed funds market arose primarily as a way for banks to transfer balances to meet reserve requirements, today the market has evolved to the point that many large banks use federal funds in a straightforward way as one component of their total sources of funding. Therefore, the fed funds rate is simply the rate of interest on very-short-term loans among banks. While most investors cannot participate in this market, the fed funds rate commands great interest as a key barometer of monetary policy.

# Brokers' Calls

Individuals who buy stocks on margin borrow part of the funds to pay for the stocks from their broker. The broker in turn may borrow the funds from a bank, agreeing to repay the bank immediately (on call) if the bank requests it. The rate paid on such loans is usually about  $1\%$  higher than the rate on short-term T-bills.

# LIBOR and Its Replacements

The London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) was, until 2021, the premier short-term interest rate quoted in the European money market and served as a reference rate for a wide range of financial contracts. For example, a corporation or homeowner might have borrowed at a rate equal to LIBOR plus two percentage points. Hundreds of trillions of dollars of loans, mortgages, and derivative contracts were tied to it.

LIBOR and similar rates called Euribor (European interbank offer rate) and Tibor (Tokyo interbank offer rate) were quoted in several major currencies (e.g., the U.S. dollar, the British pound, the yen, the euro). However, they were all based on surveys of rates reported by participating banks. When a major scandal surrounding those surveys hit the LIBOR market in 2012 (see the "End of LIBOR" box), the search for a replacement was on.

One of the problems with LIBOR and its related rates was that they did not reflect actual transactions between disinterested parties with money at stake. Banks faced no real cost if they provided inaccurate answers to the rate surveys. In contrast, the replacements are overnight interest rates at which borrowing and lending actually takes place. In the United States, LIBOR is giving way to SOFR, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, which is the rate on overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by Treasury securities.

Because SOFR is the rate on a well-collateralized loan, it embodies essentially no premium for credit risk. In contrast, LIBOR rates could increase dramatically when bank risk was perceived to be higher, for example in 2008 during the financial crisis. In this sense, SOFR is a "cleaner" indicator of the pure time value of money than LIBOR was.

As noted in the "End of LIBOR" box, reference rates across the world are being replaced by rates paid on actual overnight transactions. Unlike SOFR, the rates used outside the United States are generally for unsecured transactions, but as a very short-term loan among high-rated banks, they entail minimal credit risk.

One issue with these new benchmarks is the very short-term (overnight) period of the loans they measure. LIBOR had been quoted for loans with terms ranging from overnight to several months. The longer term versions of these replacement rates require some sort of averaging of these daily rates. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York now publishes SOFR averages for periods of 30, 90, and 180 days over the period ending on a particular date.

LIBOR was supposed to be fully phased out by 2021. However, the phase-out schedule has slipped a bit. While the Federal Reserve has directed banks to stop writing new contracts using LIBOR, existing contracts may remain in force until June 2023.

# Yields on Money Market Instruments

Although most money market securities are low risk, they are not risk-free. The securities of the money market promise yields greater than those on default-free T-bills, at least in part because of their greater risk. In addition, many investors require more liquidity; thus, they will accept lower yields on securities such as T-bills that can be quickly and cheaply sold for cash. Figure 2.2 shows that federal funds, for example, consistently have offered a yield premium over T-bills. Moreover, that premium increased with economic crises such as the energy price shocks associated with the two OPEC disturbances, the stock market crash in 1987, the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998, and the financial

LIBOR was designed initially as a survey of interbank lending rates but soon became a key determinant of short-term interest rates with far-reaching significance. More than 500 trillion of derivative contracts as well as trillions of dollars of loans and bonds with floating interest rates were linked to it

However, LIBOR was not a rate at which actual transactions occurred; instead, it was just a survey of "estimated" borrowing rates, and that made it vulnerable to tampering. Several large banks were asked to submit the rate at which they claimed to believe they could borrow in the interbank market.

In 2012, it emerged that several participating banks were colluding by shading their LIBOR submissions to enhance profits on derivatives trades. Traders used e-mails and instant messages to tell each other whether they wanted to see higher or lower submissions. Members of this informal cartel essentially set up a "favor bank" to help each other move the survey average up or down depending on their trading positions. More than 6 billion of fines were paid by the participating banks.


LIBOR is being replaced by interest rates on actual interbank loans: SOFR in the United States and SONIA (Sterling Overnight Index Average) in the United Kingdom. Similar survey rates elsewhere are also due to be replaced. For example, Tibor, the Japanese yen interbank rate, is giving way to TONA (the Tokyo overnight average rate). Euro-denominated contracts will replace Euribor with ESTER (Euro short-term rate, also called €STER).

crisis of 2008-2009. If you look back to Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1, you'll see that the TED spread, the difference between the LIBOR rate and Treasury bills, also peaked during periods of financial stress as well as during the COVID crisis of 2020.

# Money Market Funds

Money market funds are mutual funds that invest in money market instruments. They are a major conduit for the funds invested in the money market: In mid-2022, the total assets managed by these funds amounted to about 4.5 trillion. While money market funds usually pose extremely low risk to investors, the financial crisis constituted a traumatic shock to these markets. The nearby box discusses the fallout of the crisis.

# Money Market Funds and the Financial Crisis

Money market funds are mutual funds that invest in the short-term debt instruments that comprise the money market. They are required to hold only short-maturity debt of the highest quality: The average maturity of their holdings must be maintained at less than 3 months. Because of this very conservative investment profile, money market funds typically experience extremely low price risk. Investors for their part usually acquire check-writing privileges with their funds and often use them as a close substitute for a bank account. This is feasible because the funds almost always maintain share value at 1.00 and pass along all investment earnings to their investors as interest.

Until 2008, only one fund had "broken the buck," that is, suffered losses large enough to force value per share below  \$1. But when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection on September 15, 2008, several funds that had invested heavily in its commercial paper suffered large losses. The next day, the Reserve Primary Fund, the oldest money market fund, broke the buck when its value per share fell to only$ .97.

The realization that money market funds were at risk in the credit crisis led to a wave of investor redemptions similar to a run on a bank. In response, the U.S. Treasury announced that it would make federal insurance available to money market funds willing to pay an insurance fee. This program would thus be similar to FDIC bank insurance. With the federal insurance in place, the outflows were quelled.

However, the turmoil in Wall Street's money market funds had already spilled over into "Main Street." Fearing further investor redemptions, money market funds became afraid to commit funds even over short periods, and their demand for commercial paper effectively dried up. Firms throughout the economy had come to depend on those markets as a major source of short-term finance to fund expenditures ranging from salaries to inventories. Further breakdown in the money markets would have had an immediate crippling effect on the broad economy.

To end the panic and stabilize the money markets, the federal government decided to guarantee investments in money market funds. The guarantee did, in fact, calm investors and end the run, but it put the government on the hook for a potential liability of up to 3 trillion—the assets held in money market funds at the time.

U.S. regulators since approved a series of reforms to reduce the risks of runs on these funds. Institutional money market funds (those servicing institutions rather than private investors) are required to "float" the prices of their shares based on the value of their assets rather than maintain a fixed  \$1 value per share. This limits the incentive during a crisis for investors to compete to be the first to withdraw funds while share prices are maintained at a nonsustainable level of\$ 1. In addition, funds now have the authority to either limit redemptions or impose redemption fees of up to 2\% if a fund's assets fall by more than 30\%.

In 2021, however, the SEC floated new proposals to replace the ones put in place after the financial crisis. In the face of redemptions, funds typically sell their most-liquid holdings and can be left holding less-liquid assets just as their values might be falling. With share prices fixed at 1, this gives an incentive to investors to redeem their shares quickly before the buck may be broken. The SEC thus proposed a "swing factor" on days with net redemptions. The factor is intended to assess the impact of sales on the less liquid assets still held in fund portfolios. By aligning share prices to portfolio value, investors' incentives to cash out in front of other shareholders would presumably be minimized. These proposals have elicited considerable pushback from the industry, however.

To further limit volatility, the SEC also proposed an increase in the allowed share of money-market fund assets that mature within one day from  $10\%$  to  $25\%$  and in the share maturing in a week from  $30\%$  to  $50\%$ .

Today, there is greater concern paid to credit risk in the money market, and as a result investors now distinguish between prime and government funds. Government funds hold short-term U.S. Treasury or agency securities. Prime funds also hold other money market instruments, for example, commercial paper or CDs. For this reason, they are considered slightly riskier, and offer higher yields. We return to these funds in Chapter 4.

# 2.2 The Bond Market

The bond market is composed of longer term borrowing or debt instruments than those that trade in the money market. This market includes Treasury notes and bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, mortgage securities, and federal agency debt.

These instruments are sometimes said to comprise the fixed-income capital market because most of them promise either a fixed stream of income or a stream of income that is determined according to a specific formula. In practice, these formulas can result in a flow of income that is far from fixed. Therefore, the term fixed income is probably not fully appropriate. It is simpler and more straightforward to call these securities either debt instruments or bonds.

# Treasury Notes and Bonds

The U.S. government borrows funds in large part by selling Treasury notes and Treasury bonds. T-notes are issued with maturities ranging up to 10 years, while bonds are issued with maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years. Both notes and bonds may be issued in increments of \$100 but far more commonly trade in denominations of \$1,000. Both notes and bonds make semiannual interest payments called coupon payments, a name derived from precomputer days, when investors would literally clip a coupon attached to the bond and present it to receive the interest payment.

Figure 2.3 is a listing of Treasury issues. The coupon rate of the highlighted bond, which matures in February 2036, is  $4.50\%$ . Its bid price is 138.234. (This is the decimal version of  $138^{30} / _{128}$ . The minimum tick size, or price increment in the Treasury-bond market, is generally  ${}^{1} / _{128}$  of a point.) Although bonds are typically traded in denominations of \$1,000 par value, prices are quoted as a percentage of par. Thus, the bid price should be interpreted as  $138.234\%$  of par, or  $\$1,382.34$  for the  $\$1,000$  par value bond. Similarly, the ask price at which the bond could be purchased from a dealer is  $138.244\%$  of par, or  $\$1,382.44$ . The .960 change means that the asked price on this day increased by .960\% of par value (equivalently, by  ${}^{123} / _{128}$  of a point) from the previous day's close. Finally, the yield to maturity based on the asked price is  $1.525\%$ .

The yield to maturity reported in the last column is calculated by doubling the semiannual yield, rather than compounding it for two half-year periods. This use of a simple interest technique to annualize means that the yield is quoted as an annual percentage rate (APR) rather than as an effective annual yield. The APR in this context is also called the bond equivalent yield. We discuss the yield to maturity in more detail in Part Four.

# Inflation-Protected Treasury Bonds

The natural place to start building an investment portfolio is at the least risky end of the spectrum. Around the world, governments of many countries, including the United States, have issued bonds that are linked to an index of the cost of living in order to provide their citizens with an effective way to hedge inflation risk.

In the United States, inflation-protected Treasury bonds are called TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities). The principal amount on these bonds is adjusted in proportion to increases in the Consumer Price Index. Therefore, they provide a constant stream of income in real (inflation-adjusted) dollars. Yields on TIPS bonds should be interpreted as real or inflation-adjusted interest rates. We return to TIPS bonds in more detail in Chapter 14.

# Federal Agency Debt

Some government agencies issue their own securities to finance their activities. These agencies usually are formed to channel credit to a particular sector of the economy that Congress believes might not receive adequate credit through normal private sources.

The major mortgage-related agencies are the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae), the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, or Freddie Mac). The FHLB borrows money by issuing securities and lends this money to savings and loan institutions to be lent in turn to individuals borrowing for home mortgages.

Although the debt of federal agencies was never explicitly insured by the federal government, it had long been assumed that the government would assist an agency nearing default. Those beliefs were validated when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac encountered severe financial distress in September 2008. With both firms on the brink of insolvency, the government stepped in, put them both into conservatorship, and assigned the Federal Housing Finance Agency to run the firms; however, it did in fact agree to make good on the firm's bonds.

# International Bonds

Many firms borrow abroad, and many investors buy bonds from foreign issuers. In addition to national capital markets, there is a thriving international capital market, largely centered in London.

A Eurobond is a bond denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which it is issued. For example, a dollar-denominated bond sold in Britain would be called a Eurodollar bond. Similarly, investors might speak of Euroyen bonds, yen-denominated bonds sold outside Japan. Because the European currency is called the euro, the term Eurobond may be confusing. It is best to think of them simply as international bonds.

In contrast to bonds that are issued in foreign currencies, many firms issue bonds in foreign countries but in the currency of the investor. For example, a Yankee bond is a dollar-denominated bond sold in the United States by a non-U.S. issuer. Similarly, Samurai bonds are yen-denominated bonds sold in Japan by non-Japanese issuers.

# Municipal Bonds

Municipal bonds are issued by state and local governments. They are similar to Treasury and corporate bonds except that their interest income is exempt from federal income taxation. The interest income also is usually exempt from state and local taxation in the issuing state. Capital gains taxes, however, must be paid on "munis" when the bonds mature or if they are sold for more than the investor's purchase price.

Figure 2.4 Tax-exempt debt outstanding

General obligation bonds are backed by the "full faith and credit" (i.e., the taxing power) of the issuer, while revenue bonds are issued to finance particular projects and are backed either by the revenues from that project or by the particular municipal agency operating the project. Typical issuers of revenue bonds are airports, hospitals, and turnpike or port authorities. Obviously, revenue bonds are riskier in terms of default than general obligation bonds. Figure 2.4 plots outstanding amounts of both types of municipal securities.

An industrial development bond is a revenue bond that is issued to finance commercial enterprises, such as the construction of a factory that can be operated by a private firm. In effect, these private-purpose bonds give the firm access to the municipality's ability to borrow at tax-exempt rates, and the federal government limits the amount of these bonds that may be issued.[2]

Like Treasury bonds, municipal bonds vary widely in maturity. A good deal of the debt issued is in the form of short-term tax anticipation notes, which raise funds to pay for expenses before actual collection of taxes. Other municipal debt is long term and used to fund large capital investments. Maturities range up to 30 years.

The key feature of municipal bonds is their tax-exempt status. Because investors pay neither federal nor state taxes on the interest proceeds, they are willing to accept lower yields on these securities.

An investor choosing between taxable and tax-exempt bonds must compare after-tax returns on each bond. An exact comparison requires a computation of after-tax rates of return that explicitly accounts for taxes on income and realized capital gains. In practice, there is a simpler rule of thumb. If we let  $t$  denote the investor's combined federal plus local marginal tax bracket and  $r_{\text{taxable}}$  denote the total before-tax rate of return available on taxable bonds, then  $r_{\mathrm{taxable}}(1 - t)$  is the after-tax rate available on those securities. If this value exceeds the rate on municipal bonds,  $r_{\mathrm{muni}}$ , the investor does better holding the taxable bonds. Otherwise, the tax-exempt municipalities provide higher after-tax returns.


One way to compare bonds is to determine the interest rate on taxable bonds that would be necessary to provide an after-tax return equal to that of principals. To derive this value, we set after-tax yields equal and solve for the equivalent taxable yield of the tax-exempt bond. This is the rate a taxable bond must offer to match the after-tax yield on the tax-free municipal.

$$ r _ {\text {t a x a b l e}} (1 - t) = r _ {\text {m u n i}} \tag {2.1}
$$ or


$$ r _ {\text {t a x a b l e}} = r _ {\text {m u n i}} / (1 - t) \tag {2.2}
$$

Thus, the equivalent taxable yield is simply the tax-free rate divided by  $1 - t$ . Table 2.1 presents equivalent taxable yields for several municipal yields and tax rates.

This table frequently appears in the marketing literature for tax-exempt mutual bond funds because it demonstrates to high-tax-bracket investors that municipal bonds offer highly attractive equivalent taxable yields. Each entry is calculated from Equation 2.2. If the equivalent taxable yield exceeds the actual yields offered on taxable bonds, the investor is better off after taxes holding municipal bonds. Notice that the equivalent taxable interest rate increases with the investor's tax bracket; the higher the bracket, the more valuable the tax-exempt feature of Municipals. Thus, high-tax-bracket investors tend to hold Municipals.

We also can use Equation 2.1 or 2.2 to find the tax bracket at which investors are indifferent between taxable and tax-exempt bonds. The cutoff tax bracket is given by solving Equation 2.2 for the tax bracket at which after-tax yields are equal. Doing so, we find that

$$
\text {C u t o f f} = 1 - \frac {r _ {\text {m u n i}}}{r _ {\text {t a x a b l e}}} \tag {2.3}
$$

Thus, the yield ratio  $r_{\mathrm{muni}} / r_{\mathrm{taxable}}$  is a key determinant of the attractiveness of municipal bonds. The higher the yield ratio, the lower the cutoff tax bracket, and the more individuals will prefer to hold municipal debt.

As a rough guide to the cutoff tax bracket, Figure 2.5 plots the ratio of 20-year municipal debt yields to the yield on Baa-rated corporate debt. The default risk of these corporate

# Table 2.1

Equivalent taxable yields corresponding to various tax-exempt yields and municipal bonds may be comparable, but certainly will fluctuate over time. For example, the sharp run-up in the ratio beginning in 2011 probably reflects increased concern at the time about the precarious financial condition of several states and municipalities, leading to higher credit spreads on their bonds.

# Example 2.1 Taxable versus Tax-Exempt Yields

Figure 2.5 shows that for most of the last 40 years, the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields fluctuated around .70. What does this imply about the cutoff tax bracket above which tax-exempt bonds provide higher after-tax yields? Equation 2.3 shows that an investor whose tax bracket (federal plus local) exceeds  $1 - .70 = .30$ , or  $30\%$ , will derive a greater after-tax yield from principals. As we pointed out, however, it is difficult to control precisely for differences in the risks of these bonds, so the cutoff tax bracket must be taken as approximate.

Suppose your combined federal plus state tax bracket is  $30\%$ . Would you prefer to earn a  $6\%$  taxable return or a  $4\%$  tax-free return? What is the equivalent taxable yield of the  $4\%$  tax-free yield?

# Corporate Bonds

Corporate bonds are the means by which private firms borrow money directly from the public. These bonds are similar in structure to Treasury issues—they typically pay semi-annual coupons over their lives and return the face value to the bondholder at maturity. They differ most importantly from Treasury bonds because of default risk, and Chapter 14 discusses this issue in considerable detail. For now, we distinguish only among secured bonds, which have specific collateral backing them in the event of firm bankruptcy; unsecured bonds, called debentures, which have no collateral; and subordinated debentures, which have a lower priority claim to the firm's assets in the event of bankruptcy.


Corporate bonds sometimes come with options attached. Callable bonds give the firm the option to repurchase the bond from the holder at a stipulated call price. Convertible bonds give the bondholder the option to convert each bond into a stipulated number of shares of stock. These options are treated in more detail in Chapter 14.

# Mortgage and Asset-Backed Securities

Using mortgage-backed securities, almost anyone can invest in a portfolio of mortgage loans, and these securities have become a major component of the fixed-income market. As described in Chapter 1, a mortgage-backed security is either an ownership claim in a pool of mortgages or an obligation that is secured by such a pool. Most pass-throughs have traditionally been composed of conforming mortgages, which means that the loans must satisfy certain underwriting guidelines (standards for the creditworthiness of the borrower) before they may be purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, however, a large amount of subprime mortgages, that is, riskier loans made to financially weaker borrowers, were bundled and sold by "private-label" issuers. Figure 2.6 shows that both agency and private-label mortgage-backed securities enjoyed explosive growth, at least until the crisis.

In an effort to make housing more affordable to low-income households, Fannie and Freddie had been encouraged to buy subprime mortgage securities. As we saw in Chapter 1, these loans turned out to be disastrous, with trillion-dollar losses spread among banks, hedge funds and other investors, and Freddie and Fannie, which lost billions of dollars on the subprime mortgage pools they had purchased. You can see from Figure 2.6 that starting in 2007, the market in private-label mortgage pass-throughs began to shrink rapidly.

Despite these troubles, securitization has become an increasingly common staple of many credit markets. For example, car loans, student loans, home equity loans, credit card loans, and even debt of private firms now are commonly bundled into pass-through securities that can be traded in the capital market. Figure 2.7 documents the rapid growth of nonmortgage asset-backed securities, at least until 2007. After the financial crisis and during Covid, the market contracted considerably, but it is still substantial.

# 2.3 Equity Securities

# Common Stock as Ownership Shares

Common stocks, also known as equity securities or equities, represent ownership shares in a corporation. Each share of common stock entitles its owner to one vote on any matters of corporate governance that are put to a vote at the corporation's annual meeting and to a share in the financial benefits of ownership.

The corporation is controlled by a board of directors elected by the shareholders. The board, which meets only a few times each year, selects managers who actually run the firm on a day-to-day basis. Managers have the authority to make most business decisions without the board's specific approval. The board's mandate is to oversee the management to ensure that it acts in the best interests of shareholders.

The members of the board are elected at the annual meeting. Shareholders who do not attend the annual meeting can vote by proxy, empowering another party to vote in their name. Management usually solicits the proxies of shareholders and normally gets a vast majority of these proxy votes. Thus, management usually has considerable discretion to run the firm as it sees fit—without daily oversight from the equityholders who actually own the firm.

We noted in Chapter 1 that such separation of ownership and control can give rise to "agency problems," in which managers pursue goals not in the best interests of shareholders. However, several mechanisms alleviate these problems. Among these are compensation schemes that link the success of the manager to that of the firm; oversight by the board of directors as well as outsiders such as security analysts, creditors, or large institutional investors; the threat of a proxy contest in which unhappy shareholders attempt to replace the current management team; or the threat of a takeover by another firm.

The common stock of most large corporations can be bought or sold freely on one or more stock markets. A corporation whose stock is not publicly traded is said to be private. In most privately held corporations, the owners of the firm also take an active role in its management. Therefore, takeovers are generally not an issue.

# Characteristics of Common Stock

The two most important characteristics of common stock as an investment are its residual claim and limited liability features.

Residual claim means that stockholders are the last in line of all those who have a claim on the assets and income of the corporation. In a liquidation of the firm's assets, the shareholders have a claim to what is left after all other claimants such as the tax authorities, employees, suppliers, bondholders, and other creditors have been paid. For a firm not in liquidation, shareholders have claim to the part of operating income left over after interest and taxes have been paid. Management can either pay this residual as cash dividends to shareholders or reinvest it in the business to increase the value of the shares.

Limited liability means that the most shareholders can lose in the event of failure of the corporation is their original investment. Unlike owners of unincorporated businesses, whose creditors can lay claim to the personal assets of the owner (house, car, furniture), corporate shareholders may at worst have worthless stock. They are not personally liable for the firm's obligations.

# Stock Market Listings

Figure 2.8 presents key trading data for a small sample of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The NYSE is one of several markets in which investors may buy or sell shares of stock. We will examine these markets in detail in Chapter 3.

To interpret Figure 2.8, consider the highlighted listing for Hershey. The table provides the ticker symbol (HSY), the closing price of the stock (\$177.57), and its change (\$1.64) from the previous trading day. About 658,000 shares of Hershey traded on this day. The figure also provides the highest and lowest price at which the stock has traded in

The annual dividend over the coming year is forecast at 3.22, which implies a annual dividend yield (i.e., annual dividend per dollar paid for the stock) of 3.22/177.57 = .0181, or 1.81\%.

The dividend yield is only part of the return on a stock investment. It ignores prospective capital gains (i.e., price increases) or losses. Low-dividend firms presumably offer greater prospects for capital gains, or investors would not be willing to hold these stocks in their portfolios. If you scan Figure 2.8, you will see that dividend yields vary widely across companies.

The P/E ratio, or price-earnings ratio, is the ratio of the current stock price to last year's earnings per share. The P/E ratio tells us how much stock purchasers must pay per dollar of earnings that the firm generates. For Hershey, the ratio of price to earnings is 26.42. The P/E ratio also varies widely across firms. Where the dividend yield and P/E ratio are not reported in Figure 2.8, the firms have zero dividends, or zero or negative earnings. We shall have much to say about P/E ratios in Chapter 18.

# Preferred Stock

Preferred stock has features similar to both equity and debt. Like a bond, it promises to pay a fixed amount of income each year. In this sense, preferred stock is similar to an infinite-maturity bond, that is, a perpetuity. It also resembles a bond in that it does not convey voting power regarding the management of the firm.

Preferred stock is nevertheless an equity investment. The firm has no contractual obligation to make the dividend payments. Instead, preferred dividends are usually cumulative; that is, unpaid dividends cumulate and must be paid in full before any dividends may be paid to holders of common stock. In contrast, the firm does have a contractual obligation to make the interest payments on the debt. Failure to make these payments sets off corporate bankruptcy proceedings.

Preferred stock also differs from bonds in terms of tax treatment. Because preferred stock payments are treated as dividends rather than interest, they are not tax-deductible expenses for the firm. This disadvantage is somewhat offset by the fact that corporations may exclude  $50\%$  of dividends received from domestic corporations when they compute taxable income. Preferred stocks therefore are desirable fixed-income investments for some corporations.

Even though preferred stock ranks after bonds in terms of the priority of its claims to the assets of the firm in the event of corporate bankruptcy, it often sells at lower yields.

Presumably, this reflects the value of the  $50\%$  dividend exclusion because the higher risk of preferred stock would tend to result in higher yields than those offered by bonds. Individual investors, who cannot use the tax exclusion, generally will find preferred stock yields unattractive relative to those on other assets.

Preferred stock is issued in variations similar to those of corporate bonds. It may be callable, in which case it is said to be redeemable. It also may be convertible into common stock at some specified conversion ratio. Adjustable-rate preferred stock is another variation that, like adjustable-rate bonds, ties the dividend to current market interest rates.

# Depositary Receipts

American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, are certificates traded in U.S. markets that represent ownership in shares of a foreign company. Each ADR may correspond to ownership of a fraction of a foreign share, one share, or several shares of the foreign corporation. ADRs were created to make it easier for foreign firms to satisfy U.S. security registration requirements. They are the most common way for U.S. investors to directly invest in and trade the shares of foreign corporations.

# 2.4 Stock and Bond Market Indexes

# Stock Market Indexes

The daily performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a staple portion of the evening news. Although the Dow is the best-known measure of the performance of the stock market, it is only one of several indicators, and far from the best. Other more broadly based indexes are computed and published daily. In addition, several indexes of bond market performance are widely available.

The ever-increasing role of international trade and investments has made indexes of foreign financial markets part of the general news as well. Thus, foreign stock exchange indexes such as the Nikkei Average of Tokyo and the Financial Times index of London have become household names.

# Dow Jones Industrial Average

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) of 30 large, "blue-chip" corporations has been computed since 1896. Its long history probably accounts for its preeminence in the public mind. (The average covered only 20 stocks until 1928.)

Originally, the DJIA was calculated as the average price of the stocks included in the index. Thus, one would add up the prices of the 30 stocks in the index and divide by 30. The percentage change in the DJIA would then be the percentage change in the average price of the 30 shares.

Therefore, the percentage change in the DJIA measures the return (excluding dividends) on a portfolio that invests one share in each of the 30 stocks in the index. The value of such a portfolio (holding one share of each stock in the index) is the sum of the 30 prices. Because the percentage change in the average of the 30 prices is the same as the percentage change in the sum of the 30 prices, the index and the portfolio have the same percentage change each day.

Data to construct stock price indexes

Table 2.2

<table><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Initial Price</td><td>Final Price</td><td>Shares (million)</td><td>Initial Value of Outstanding Stock ($ million)</td><td>Final Value of Outstanding Stock ($ million)</td></tr><tr><td>ABC</td><td>$ 25</td><td>$30</td><td>20</td><td>$500</td><td>$600</td></tr><tr><td>XYZ</td><td>100</td><td>90</td><td>1</td><td>100</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>$600</td><td>$690</td></tr></table>

Because the Dow corresponds to a portfolio that holds one share of each component stock, the investment in each company in that portfolio is proportional to the company's share price. Therefore, the Dow is called a price-weighted average.

# Example 2.2 Price-Weighted Average

Consider the data in Table 2.2 for a hypothetical two-stock version of the Dow Jones Average. Let's compare the changes in the value of the portfolio holding one share of each firm and the price-weighted index. Stock ABC starts at  \$25 a share and increases to\$ 30. Stock XYZ starts at \$100 but falls to \$90.

```txt
Portfolio: Initial value = \ 25 + \$ 100 = \$ 125 Final value =\ 30 + \ 90 = \$ 120 Percentage change in portfolio value = -5 / 125 = -.04 = -4\% Index: Initial index value = (25 + 100)/2 = 62.5 Final index value = (30 + 90)/2 = 60 Percentage change in index \doteq -2.5 / 62.5 = -.04 = -4\%
```

The portfolio and the index have identical  $4\%$  declines in value.

Notice that price-weighted averages give higher-priced shares more weight in determining performance of the index. For example, although ABC increased by  $20\%$ , while XYZ fell by only  $10\%$ , the index dropped in value. This is because the  $20\%$  increase in ABC represented a smaller price gain (5 per share) than the  $10\%$  decrease in XYZ (10 per share). The "Dow portfolio" has four times as much invested in XYZ as in ABC because XYZ's price is four times that of ABC. We conclude that a high-price stock can dominate a price-weighted average.

You might wonder why the DJIA is now (in mid-2022) at a level of about 31,000 if it is supposed to be the average price of the 30 stocks in the index. The DJIA no longer equals the average price of the 30 stocks because the averaging procedure is adjusted whenever a stock splits or pays a stock dividend of more than  $10\%$ , or when one company in the group of 30 industrial firms is replaced by another. When these events occur, the divisor used to compute the "average price" is adjusted so as to leave the index unaffected by the event.

# Example 2.3 Splits and Price-Weighted Averages

Suppose XYZ from Example 2.2 splits two for one so that its share price falls to 50. We would not want the average to fall, as that would incorrectly indicate a fall in the general level of market prices. Following a split, the divisor is reduced to a value that leaves the average unaffected.

We find the new divisor using the post-split price data from Table 2.3. The index value before the stock split  $= 125 / 2 = 62.5$ . We must find a new divisor,  $d$ , that leaves the index unchanged after XYZ splits and its price falls to \$50. Therefore, we solve for  $d$  in the following equation:

$$
\frac {\text {P r i c e o f A B C} + \text {P r i c e o f X Y Z}}{d} = \frac {2 5 + 5 0}{d} = 6 2. 5
$$ which implies that the divisor must fall from its original value of 2.0 to a new value of 1.20.


Because the split changes the price of stock XYZ, it changes the relative weights of the two stocks in the price-weighted average. Therefore, the return of the index is also affected.

At period-end, ABC will sell for  \$30, while XYZ will sell for\$ 45, representing the same negative 10\% return it was assumed to earn in Table 2.2. The new value of the price-weighted average will be (30 + 45)/1.20 = 62.5, the same as its value at the start of the year; therefore, its return is zero, rather than the -4\% return that we calculated in the absence of a split.

The split reduces the relative weight of XYZ because its initial price is lower, and because XYZ is the poorer performing stock, the performance of the average is higher. We see that the implicit weighting scheme of a price-weighted average is somewhat arbitrary, being determined by the prices rather than by the outstanding market values (price per share times number of shares) of the shares in the average.

<table><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Initial Price</td><td>Final Price</td><td>Shares (million)</td><td>Initial Value of Outstanding Stock ($ million)</td><td>Final Value of Outstanding Stock ($ million)</td></tr><tr><td>ABC</td><td>$25</td><td>$30</td><td>20</td><td>$500</td><td>$600</td></tr><tr><td>XYZ</td><td>50</td><td>45</td><td>2</td><td>100</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>$600</td><td>$690</td></tr></table>

Table 2.3

Data to construct stock price indexes after a stock split

In the same way that the divisor is updated for stock splits, if one firm is dropped from the average and another firm with a different price is added, the divisor has to be updated to leave the average unchanged by the substitution. By 2022, the divisor for the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen to a value of about .152.

Because the Dow Jones averages are based on small numbers of firms, care must be taken to ensure that they are representative of the broad market. As a result, the composition of the average is changed every so often to reflect changes in the economy. Table 2.4 presents the composition of the Dow industrials in 1928 as well as its composition as of 2022. The table presents striking evidence of the changes in the U.S. economy in the last century. Many of the "bluest of the blue chip" companies in 1928 no longer exist, and the industries that were the backbone of the economy in 1928 have given way to some that could not have been imagined at the time.

# Concept Check 2.4

Suppose the price of XYZ in Table 2.2 increases to  \$110, while ABC falls to\$ 20. Find the percentage change in the price-weighted average of these two stocks. Compare that to the percentage return of a portfolio holding one share in each company.

# The Standard & Poor's 500 Index

The Standard & Poor's Composite 500 (S&P 500) stock index represents an improvement over the Dow Jones Averages in two ways. First, it is a more broadly based index of about 500 firms. Second, it is a market-value-weighted index. For firms XYZ and ABC in Example 2.2, the S&P 500 would give ABC five times the weight given to XYZ because the market value of its outstanding equity is five times larger, \$500 million versus \$100 million.

The S&P 500 is computed by calculating the total market value of the 500 firms in the index and the total market value of those firms on the previous day of trading. The percentage increase in the total market value from one day to the next represents the increase in the index. The rate of return of the index equals the rate of return that would be earned by an investor holding a portfolio of all 500 firms in the index in proportion to their market values, except that the index does not reflect dividends paid by those firms.

Actually, most indexes today use a modified version of market-value weights. Rather than weighting by total market value, they weight by the market value of free float, that is, by the value of shares that are freely tradable among investors. For example, this procedure does not count shares held by founding families or governments. These shares are effectively not available for investors to purchase. The distinction is more important in Japan and Europe, where a higher fraction of shares are held in such nontraded portfolios.

# Example 2.4 Value-Weighted Indexes

To illustrate how value-weighted indexes are computed, look again at Table 2.2. The final value of all outstanding stock in our two-stock universe is  \$690 million. The initial value was\$ 600 million. Therefore, if the initial level of a market-value-weighted index of stocks ABC and XYZ were set equal to an arbitrarily chosen starting value such as 100, the index value at year-end would be  $100 \times (690 / 600) = 115$ . The increase in the index reflects the 15\% return earned on a portfolio consisting of those two stocks held in proportion to outstanding market values.

Unlike the price-weighted index, the value-weighted index gives more weight to ABC. Whereas the price-weighted index fell because it was dominated by higher-price XYZ, the value-weighted index rises because it gives more weight to ABC, the stock with the higher total market value.

Note also from Tables 2.2 and 2.3 that market-value-weighted indexes are unaffected by stock splits. The total market value of the outstanding XYZ stock decreases from  \$100 million to\$ 90 million regardless of the stock split, thereby rendering the split irrelevant to the performance of the index.

# Concept Check 2.5

Reconsider companies XYZ and ABC from Concept Check 2.4. Calculate the percentage change in the market-value-weighted index. Compare that to the rate of return of a portfolio that holds \$500 of ABC stock for every \$100 of XYZ stock (i.e., an index portfolio).

A nice feature of both market-value-weighted and price-weighted indexes is that they reflect the returns to straightforward portfolio strategies. If you buy shares in each component firm in the index in proportion to its outstanding market value, your return will match that of the value-weighted index. Similarly, a price-weighted index tracks the returns on a portfolio composed of an equal number of shares of each firm.

Investors can easily buy market indexes for their portfolios. One way is to purchase shares in mutual funds that hold shares in proportion to their representation in the S&P 500 or another index. These index funds earn a return equal to that of the index and so provide a low-cost passive investment strategy for equity investors. Another approach is to purchase an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, which is a portfolio of shares that can be bought or sold as a unit, just as one can buy or sell a single share of stock. Available ETFs range from portfolios that track extremely broad global market indexes all the way to narrow industry indexes. We discuss both mutual funds and ETFs in detail in Chapter 4.

# Russell Indexes

The Russell indexes are a family of indexes that measure the performance of distinct market segments, primarily segmented by size. While the Russell 3000 measures the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. stocks, the Russell 2500 measures the bottom 2,500 stocks included in the Russell 3000 and is thus a popular index for mid-cap to small-cap stocks ("cap" is an abbreviation for market capitalization, the total value of outstanding shares). Other indexes are the Russell 1000 (the largest 1,000 firms in the Russell 3000), the Russell Top 200 and Top 50, and the Russell Microcap (comprising the stocks ranked 2,001 through 4,000) by market cap.

The stocks included in each of these indexes are updated once a year. The indexes are capitalization weighted.

# Other U.S. Market-Value Indexes

The New York Stock Exchange publishes a market-value-weighted composite index of all NYSE-listed stocks, in addition to subindexes for industrial, utility, transportation, and financial stocks. NASDAQ computes a Composite index of more than 3,000 firms traded on the NASDAQ market. The NASDAQ 100 is a subset of the larger firms in the Composite Index, but it accounts for a large fraction of its total market capitalization.

The ultimate U.S. equity index so far computed is the Wilshire 5000 index of the market value of essentially all actively traded stocks in the United States. At one point, it included more than 5,000 stocks, but today, there are only about 3,500 stocks in the index. A similar comprehensive index is published by CRSP (the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago).

# Equally Weighted Indexes

Market performance is sometimes measured by an equally weighted average of the returns of each stock in an index. Such an averaging technique, by placing equal weight on each return, corresponds to an implicit portfolio strategy that invests equal dollar values in each stock. This is in contrast to both price weighting (which requires equal numbers of shares of each stock) and market-value weighting (which requires investments in proportion to outstanding value).

Unlike price- or market-value-weighted indexes, equally weighted indexes do not correspond to buy-and-hold portfolio strategies. Suppose that you start with equal dollar investments in the two stocks of Table 2.2, ABC and XYZ. Because ABC increases in value by  $20\%$  over the year while XYZ decreases by  $10\%$ , your portfolio no longer is equally weighted. It is now more heavily invested in ABC.

Table 2.5 you would need to rebalance: Sell off some ABC stock and/or purchase more XYZ stock. Such rebalancing would be necessary to align the return on your portfolio with that on the equally weighted index.


# Foreign and International Stock Market Indexes

Development in financial markets worldwide includes the construction of indexes for these markets. Among these are the Nikkei (Japan), FTSE (U.K.; pronounced "footsie"), DAX (Germany), Hang Seng (Hong Kong), and TSX (Canada).

A leader in the construction of international indexes has been MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International), which computes dozens of country indexes and several regional indexes. Table 2.5 presents many of the indexes computed by MSCI.

# Bond Market Indicators

Just as stock market indexes provide guidance concerning the performance of the overall stock market, several bond market indicators measure the performance of various categories of bonds. The most well-known indexes are those of Merrill Lynch, Barclays, and the

The major problem with bond market indexes is that rates of return on many bonds are difficult to compute because the infrequency with which the bonds trade makes reliable up-to-date prices difficult to obtain. In practice, some prices must be estimated from bond-valuation models. These "matrix" prices may differ from true market values.

# 2.5 Derivative Markets

Futures, options, and related derivatives contracts provide payoffs that depend on the values of other variables such as commodity prices, bond and stock prices, interest rates, or market index values. For this reason, these instruments sometimes are called derivative assets: Their values derive from the values of other assets. These assets are also called contingent claims because their payoffs are contingent on the value of other values.

# Options

A call option gives its holder the right to purchase an asset for a specified price, called the exercise or strike price, on or before a specified expiration date. For example, a January expiration call option on Microsoft stock with an exercise price of \$280 entitles its owner to purchase Microsoft stock for a price of \$280 at any time up to and including the expiration date. Each option contract is for the purchase of 100 shares. However, quotations are made on a per-share basis. The holder of the call is not required to exercise the option; it will be profitable to exercise only if the price of the underlying asset exceeds the exercise price.

When the market price exceeds the exercise price, the option holder may "call away" the asset for the exercise price and reap a payoff equal to the difference between the stock price and the exercise price. Otherwise, the option will be left unexercised. If not exercised before the expiration date of the contract, the option simply expires and no longer has value. Calls therefore provide greater profits when stock prices increase and thus represent bullish investment vehicles.

# Table 2.6

Stock options on Microsoft, July 14, 2021.

In contrast, a put option gives its holder the right to sell an asset for a specified exercise price on or before a specified expiration date. A January expiration put on Microsoft with an exercise price of  \$280 thus entitles its owner to sell Microsoft stock to the put writer at a price of\$ 280 at any time before expiration in January, even if the market price of Microsoft is lower than 280. Whereas profits on call options increase when the asset price increases, profits on put options increase when the asset price falls. The put is exercised only if its holder can deliver an asset worth less than the exercise price in return for the exercise price.

Table 2.6 presents prices of Microsoft options on July 14, 2021. The price of Microsoft shares on this date was  \$282.51. The first two columns give the expiration date and exercise (or strike) price for each option. We have included listings for call and put options with exercise prices of$ 280, $285, and \$290 per share and with expiration dates in August and September. For example, the August 6 expiration call option to purchase one share of Microsoft at an exercise price of \$285 last traded at \$5.06. Each option contract (on 100 shares) therefore costs 506.

Notice that the prices of call options decrease as the exercise price increases. For example, the August expiration call with exercise price  \$290 costs only\$ 3.31. This makes sense, because the right to purchase a share at a higher price is less valuable. Conversely, put prices increase with the exercise price. The right to sell Microsoft at a price of \$285 in August costs \$7.48, while the right to sell at \$290 costs \$10.35.

Option prices also increase with time until expiration. Clearly, one would rather have the right to buy Microsoft for  \$285 at any time until September rather than at any time until August. Not surprisingly, this shows up in a higher price for the longer expiration options. For example, the call with exercise price\$ 285 expiring on September 17 sells for \$8.45 compared to only \$5.06 for the August 6 expiration call.

# Futures Contracts

A futures contract calls for delivery of an asset (or, in some cases, its cash value) at a specified delivery or maturity date for an agreed-upon price, called the futures price, also to be paid at contract maturity. The long position is held by the trader who commits to

Table 2.7 presents trading information for corn futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Each contract calls for delivery of 5,000 bushels of corn. The first entry is for the nearest term or "front" contract, with maturity in September 2021. The futures price for delivery in September was 5.64 per bushel.


The trader holding the long position profits from price increases. Suppose that at contract maturity, corn is selling for  \$5.66 per bushel. The long position trader who entered the contract on July 15 would pay the previously agreed-upon price of\$ 5.64 for each bushel of corn, which at contract maturity would be worth 5.66.

Because each contract calls for delivery of 5,000 bushels, the profit to the long position would equal  $5,000 \times ($ 5.66 - $5.64) = $100. Conversely, the short position must deliver 5,000 bushels for the previously agreed-upon futures price. The short position's loss equals the long position's profit.

The right to purchase the asset at an agreed-upon price, as opposed to the obligation, distinguishes call options from long positions in futures contracts. A futures contract obliges the long position to purchase the asset at the futures price; the call option, in contrast, conveys the right to purchase the asset at the exercise price. The purchase will be made only if it yields a profit.

Clearly, a holder of a call has a better position than the holder of a long position on a futures contract with a futures price equal to the option's exercise price. This advantage, of course, comes only at a price. Call options must be purchased; futures contracts are entered into without cost. The purchase price of an option is called the premium. It represents the compensation the purchaser of the call must pay for the ability to exercise the option only when it is profitable to do so. Similarly, the difference between a put option and a short futures position is the right, as opposed to the obligation, to sell an asset at an agreed-upon price.

# SUMMARY

1. Money market securities are very-short-term debt obligations. They are usually highly marketable and have relatively low credit risk. Their low maturities and low credit risk ensure minimal capital gains or losses. These securities trade in large denominations, but they may be purchased indirectly through money market mutual funds.
2. Much of U.S. government borrowing is in the form of Treasury bonds and notes. These are coupon-paying bonds usually issued at or near par value. Treasury notes and bonds are similar in design to coupon-paying corporate bonds.
3. Municipal bonds are distinguished largely by their tax-exempt status. Interest payments (but not capital gains) on these securities are exempt from federal income taxes. The equivalent taxable yield offered by a municipal bond equals  $r_{\mathrm{muni}} / (1 - t)$ , where  $r_{\mathrm{muni}}$  is the municipal yield and  $t$  is the investor's tax bracket.
4. Mortgage pass-through securities are pools of mortgages sold in one package. Owners of pass-throughs receive the principal and interest payments made by the borrowers. The originator that issued the mortgage merely services it and "passes through" the payments to the purchasers of the pool. A federal agency may guarantee the payments of interest and principal on mortgages pooled into its pass-through securities, but these guarantees are absent in private-label pass-throughs.

5. Common stock is an ownership share in a corporation. Each share entitles its owner to one vote on matters of corporate governance and to a prorated share of the dividends paid to shareholders. Stock (equivalently, equity) owners are the residual claimants on the income earned by the firm.
6. Preferred stock usually pays fixed dividends for the life of the firm; it is a perpetuity. A firm's failure to pay the dividend due on preferred stock, however, does not precipitate corporate bankruptcy. Instead, unpaid dividends simply cumulate. Variants of preferred stock include convertible and adjustable-rate issues.
7. Many stock market indexes measure the performance of the overall market. The Dow Jones averages, the oldest and best-known indicators, are price-weighted indexes. Today, many broad-based, market-value-weighted indexes are computed daily. These include the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, the NASDAQ index, the Wilshire 5000 index, and indexes of many non-U.S. stock markets.
8. A call option is a right to purchase an asset at a stipulated exercise price on or before an expiration date. A put option is the right to sell an asset at some exercise price. Calls increase in value while puts decrease in value as the price of the underlying asset increases.
9. A futures contract is an obligation to buy or sell an asset at a stipulated futures price on a maturity date. The long position, which commits to purchasing, gains if the asset value increases while the short position, which commits to delivering, loses.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. The bid price of the bond is 108.224\% of par, or \$1,082.24. The asked price is 108.244 or \$1,082.44. This asked price corresponds to a yield of 1.984\%. The asked price increased 1.128 from its level yesterday, so the asked price then must have been 107.116, or 1,071.16.

2. A  $6\%$  taxable return is equivalent to an after-tax return of  $6(1 - .30) = 4.2\%$ . Therefore, you would be better off in the taxable bond. The equivalent taxable yield of the tax-free bond is  $4/(1 - .30) = 5.71\%$ . So a taxable bond would have to pay a  $5.71\%$  yield to provide the same after-tax return as a tax-free bond offering a  $4\%$  yield.

3. a. You are entitled to a prorated share of Intel's dividend payments and to vote in any of IBM's stockholder meetings.

$b$ . Your potential gain is unlimited because the stock price has no upper bound.
 c. Your outlay was $55 × 100 = $5,500. Because of limited liability, this is the most you can lose.

4. The price-weighted index increases from 62.5 [i.e., (100 + 25)/2] to 65 [i.e., (110 + 20)/2], a gain of 4\%. An investment of one share in each company requires an outlay of \$125 that would increase in value to \$130, for a return of 4\% (i.e., 5/125), which equals the return to the price-weighted index.
 5. The market-value-weighted index return is calculated by computing the increase in the value of the stock portfolio. The portfolio of the two stocks starts with an initial value of \$100 million + \$500 million = \$600 million and falls in value to \$110 million + \$400 million = \$510 million, a loss of 90/600 = .15, or 15\%. The index portfolio return is a weighted average of the returns on each stock with weights of 1/6 on XYZ and 5/6 on ABC (weights proportional to relative investments). Because the return on XYZ is 10\%, while that on ABC is -20\%, the index portfolio return is 1/6 × 10\% + 5/6 × (-20\%) = -15\%, equal to the return on the market-value-weighted index.
 6. The payoff to the call option is \$10 per share at expiration. The option cost is \$8.45 per share. The dollar profit is therefore \$1.55. The put option expires worthless. Therefore, the investor's loss is the cost of the put, or \$10.79.

# How Securities Are Traded

# 3

THIS CHAPTER WILL provide you with a broad introduction to the many venues and procedures available for trading securities in the United States and international markets. We will see that trading mechanisms range from direct negotiation among market participants to fully automated computer crossing of trade orders.

The first time a security trades is when it is issued to the public. Therefore, we begin with a look at how securities are first marketed to the public by investment bankers, the midwives of securities. We turn next to a broad survey of how already-issued securities may be traded among investors, focusing on the differences among dealer markets, electronic markets, and specialist/ designated market maker markets. With this background, we consider specific trading arenas such as the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and several all-electronic markets. We compare the mechanics of trade execution and the impact of cross-market integration of trading.


We then turn to the essentials of some specific types of transactions, such as buying on margin and short-selling stocks. We close the chapter with a look at some important aspects of the regulations governing security trading, including insider trading laws, and the role of security markets as self-regulating organizations.

# 3.1 How Firms Issue Securities

Firms regularly need to raise new capital to help pay for their many investment projects. Broadly speaking, they can raise funds either by borrowing or by selling shares in the firm. Investment bankers are generally hired to manage the sale of these securities in what is called a primary market for newly issued securities. Once these securities are issued, however, investors might well wish to trade them among themselves. For example, you may decide to raise cash by selling some of your shares in Apple to another investor. This transaction would have no impact on the total outstanding number of Apple shares. Trades in existing securities take place in the so-called secondary market.

Shares of publicly listed firms trade continually in markets such as the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market. There, any investor can choose to buy shares for his or her portfolio. These companies are also called publicly traded, publicly owned, or just public companies. Other firms, however, are private corporations, whose shares are held by small numbers of managers and investors. Ownership stakes in the firm are still proportional to share ownership, but those shares do not trade in public markets. While many private firms are relatively young companies that have not yet chosen to make their shares generally available to the public, others may be more established firms that are still largely owned by the company's founders or families, and others may simply have decided that private organization is preferable.


# Privately Held Firms

A privately held company is owned by a relatively small number of shareholders. These firms have fewer obligations to release financial statements and other information to the public. This saves money and frees the firm from disclosing information that might be helpful to its competitors. Some firms also believe that eliminating requirements for quarterly earnings announcements gives them more flexibility to pursue long-term goals free of shareholder pressure.

When private firms wish to raise funds, they sell shares directly to institutional or wealthy investors in a private placement. Rule 144A of the SEC allows them to make these placements without preparing the extensive and costly registration statements required of a public company. While this is attractive, shares in privately held firms do not trade in secondary markets such as a stock exchange; this greatly reduces their liquidity and thus presumably reduces the prices that investors will pay for them. Liquidity has many specific meanings, but generally speaking, it refers to the ability to buy or sell an asset at a fair price on short notice. Investors demand price concessions to buy illiquid securities.

Until recently, private firms were allowed to have only up to 499 shareholders. This limited their ability to raise large amounts of capital from a wide base of investors. Thus, almost all of the largest companies in the U.S. have been public corporations.

As firms increasingly chafed against the informational requirements of going public, federal regulators came under pressure to loosen the constraints entailed by private ownership. The JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) Act of 2012 increased from 500 to 2,000 the number of shareholders a company may have before being required to register its common stock with the SEC and file public reports. The act also loosened rules limiting the degree to which private firms could market their shares to the public. For example, to make it easier for companies to engage in crowdfunding, small public offerings may be exempt from the obligation to register with the SEC. (We saw in Chapter 1 how initial coin offerings provide another path to obtain crowdfunding.)

The act also exempts smaller public companies (those with less than 1 billion in annual gross revenues) from Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which would otherwise require them to report on the adequacy of the company's financial controls. This provision of SOX had drawn particular criticism as an undue burden on small firms.

# Publicly Traded Companies

When a private firm decides that it wishes to raise capital from a wide range of investors, it may decide to go public. This means that it will sell its securities to the general public and allow those investors to freely trade those shares in established securities markets.

This first issue of shares to the general public is called the firm's initial public offering, or IPO. Later, the firm may go back to the public and issue additional shares. A seasoned equity offering is the sale of additional shares in firms that already are publicly traded. For example, a sale by Apple of new shares of stock would be considered a seasoned new issue.

Public offerings of both stocks and bonds typically are marketed by investment bankers who in this role are called underwriters. More than one investment banker usually markets the securities. A lead firm forms an underwriting syndicate of other investment bankers to share the responsibility for the stock issue.

Investment bankers advise the firm regarding the terms on which it should attempt to sell the securities. A preliminary registration statement must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), describing the issue and the prospects of the company. When the statement is in final form and accepted by the SEC, it is called the prospectus. At this point, the price at which the securities will be offered to the public is announced.

In a typical underwriting arrangement, the investment bankers purchase the securities from the issuing company and then resell them to the public. The issuing firm sells the securities to the underwriting syndicate for the public offering price less a spread that serves as compensation to the underwriters. This procedure is called a firm commitment because the underwriters bear the risk that they won't be able to sell the stock at the planned offering price. In addition to the spread, the investment banker also may receive shares of common stock or other securities of the firm. Figure 3.1 depicts the relationships among the firm issuing the security, the lead underwriter, the underwriting syndicate, and the public.

# Shelf Registration

An important innovation was introduced in 1982 when the SEC approved Rule 415 for seasoned offerings, which allows firms that are already publicly traded to register securities and gradually sell them to the public for three years following the initial registration. Because the securities are already registered, they can be sold on short notice, with little additional paperwork. Moreover, they can be sold in small amounts without incurring substantial flotation costs. The securities are "on the shelf," ready to be issued, which has given rise to the term shelf registration.

Why does it make sense for shelf registration to be limited in time?

# Initial Public Offerings

Investment bankers manage the issuance of new securities to the public. Once the SEC has commented on the registration statement and a preliminary prospectus has been distributed to interested investors, the investment bankers organize road shows in which they travel around the country to publicize the imminent offering. These road shows serve two purposes. First, they generate interest among potential investors and provide information about the offering. Second, they provide information to the issuing firm and its underwriters about the price at which they will be able to market the securities. Large investors communicate their interest in purchasing shares of the IPO to the underwriters; these indications of interest are called a book, and the process of polling potential investors is called bookbuilding. The book provides valuable information to the issuing firm because institutional investors often will have useful insights about the market demand for the security as well as the prospects of the firm and its competitors. Investment bankers frequently revise both their initial estimates of the offering price of a security and the number of shares offered based on feedback from the investing community.

Why do investors truthfully reveal their interest in an offering to the investment banker? Might they be better off expressing little interest, in the hope that this will drive down the offering price? Truth is the better policy in this case because truth telling is rewarded. Shares of IPOs are allocated across investors in part based on the strength of each investor's expressed interest in the offering. If a firm wishes to get a large allocation when it is optimistic about the security, it needs to reveal its optimism. In turn, the underwriter needs to offer the security at a bargain price to these investors to induce them to participate in bookbuilding and share their information. Thus, IPOs commonly are underpriced compared to the price at which they could be marketed. Such underpricing is reflected in price jumps that occur on the date when the shares are first traded in public security markets.

Coursera's 2021 IPO was a fairly typical example of underpricing. The company issued about 15.7 million shares to the public at a price of  \$33. The stock price began trading at\$ 39 a share, a bit more than 18\% above the offering price.

While the explicit costs of an IPO tend to be around  $7\%$  of the funds raised, such underpricing should be viewed as another cost of the issue. For example, if Coursera had sold its shares for the \$39 that investors obviously were willing to pay for them, its IPO would have raised  $18\%$  more money than it actually did. The money "left on the table" in this case exceeded the explicit cost of the stock issue. Nevertheless, underpricing seems to be a universal phenomenon. Figure 3.2 presents average first-day returns on IPOs of stocks across the world. The results consistently indicate that IPOs are marketed to investors at attractive prices.

Pricing of IPOs is not trivial, and not all IPOs turn out to be underpriced. Some do poorly after issue. Facebook's 2012 IPO was a notable disappointment. Within a week of its IPO, Facebook's share price was 15\% below the 38 offer price, and five months later, its shares were selling at about half the offer price. (In the end, however, those who held on to their shares profited; within four years, the share price was well above 100.)

Other IPOs cannot even be fully sold to the market. Underwriters left with unmarketable securities are forced to sell them at a loss on the secondary market. Therefore, the investment banker bears price risk for an underwritten issue.

Interestingly, despite their typically attractive first-day returns (averaging over  $18\%$  between 1980 and 2020), IPOs have been poor long-term investments. Professor Jay Ritter, a leading expert in the field, has calculated the returns to a hypothetical investor buying equal amounts of each U.S. IPO between 1980 and 2019 at the close of trading on the first day the stock is listed and holding each position for three years. That portfolio underperforms the broad U.S. stock market by  $15.8\%$  for three-year holding periods and underperforms "style-matched" portfolios of firms with comparable size and ratio of book value to market value by  $5.2\%$ .

An interesting but little-used alternative to a traditional IPO is called a direct listing. In these transactions, existing shareholders can sell their shares to the public, but the company does not issue additional shares. Direct listings are used by companies that do not need to raise cash immediately but wish to become publicly traded so early investors can cash out their positions. Interest in direct listings was sparked by those of Spotify in 2018 and Slack in 2019. In 2021, SquareSpace, ZipRecruiter, and Coinbase were among the better-known listings.

Direct listings save companies the costs of an IPO. However, by forgoing an IPO, the firm forfeits some after-market support meant to stabilize post-issuance share prices. For example, underwriters usually set up lock-up periods that prohibit officers, directors, founders, and other pre-IPO investors from selling their shares for several months after the IPO. This prevents a wave of selling and presumably props up the stock price. To protect its own reputation as an underwriter, the investment bank may also purchase additional stock in the newly public firm to stabilize its price if it fears a post-IPO price decline.

# SPACs versus Traditional IPOs

While the IPOs we have described are the conventional way for firms to go public, 2021 was in large part the year of the SPAC: a special purpose acquisition company. The sponsor of the SPAC raises funds in its own IPO and goes public, but with no underlying commercial operations. It then searches for an acquisition target. If by the end of two years a suitable acquisition has not been found, the money must be returned to these early investors, typically hedge funds or other large institutional investors. But if the SPAC identifies an attractive target firm, it merges that firm into the already publicly traded SPAC. Of course, the ultimate acquisition is still unknown when the SPAC raises its own funds. For this reason, SPACs are often called blank-check firms. The reputation of the sponsor is therefore crucial.

The advantage of this model is that an attractive target can be taken public much faster, with less information disclosure, and at lower cost than in a traditional IPO. In addition, as an already publicly traded firm, the SPAC is allowed to make more extensive business projections than would be permitted for a firm engaged in a traditional IPO.

Usually, when the SPAC identifies its target, it raises additional funds to help finance the takeover. For example, Virgin Galactic was acquired by the SPAC Social Capital Hodosophia, which had previously raised  \$674 million. But the head of the SPAC invested an additional\$ 100 million in Virgin.

Founders and early investors in a SPAC usually receive special compensation. For example, they are granted options to buy additional shares of the merged firm at attractive prices. The sponsor of the SPAC also usually receives shares in the merged firm. Moreover, they have the right to withdraw their funds before a deal goes through, which limits their risk. The fraction of the firm offered to insiders at advantageous prices can be large, for example, as high as  $20\%$ . This means that the SPAC sponsors can make large profits even if the outside investors in the SPAC fare poorly.


Listings of new SPACs accounted for a bit more than half of the roughly 300 billion raised in IPOs in 2021. But while early investors have enjoyed generous returns on these vehicles, there appears to be growing unease with their performance for later investors. While there is not yet a lot of history to judge them by, they have so far underperformed the post-listing returns of conventional IPOs. On the other hand, "high-quality" SPACs, for example, those sponsored by large and presumably more knowledgeable private-equity firms, appear to have performed somewhat better.

Still, regulators, in particular the SEC, seem increasingly concerned about an uneven playing field for insiders versus regular investors. Gary Gensler, head of the SEC, has asked staff for recommendations concerning disclosure, marketing practices, and sponsor liability. Press releases that create buzz about a new offering without adhering to conventional standards for financial disclosure are a particular concern.

# 3.2 How Securities Are Traded

Financial markets develop to meet the needs of particular traders. Consider what would happen if organized markets did not exist. Any household wishing to invest in some type of financial asset would have to find others wishing to sell. Soon, venues where interested traders could meet would become popular. Eventually, financial markets would emerge from these meeting places. Thus, a pub in old London called Lloyd's launched the maritime insurance industry. A Manhattan curb on Wall Street became synonymous with the financial world.

# Types of Markets

We can differentiate four types of markets: direct search markets, brokered markets, dealer markets, and auction markets.

Direct Search Markets A direct search market is the least organized market. Buyers and sellers must seek each other out directly. An example of a transaction in such a market is the sale of old furniture where the seller advertises for buyers in a local newspaper or on Craigslist. Such markets are characterized by sporadic participation and nonstandard goods. Firms would find it difficult to profit by specializing in such an environment.

Brokered Markets The next level of organization is a brokered market. In markets where trading in a good is active, brokers find it profitable to offer search services to buyers and sellers. A good example is the real estate market, where economies of scale in searches for available homes and for prospective buyers make it worthwhile for participants to pay brokers to help them organize their searches. Brokers in particular markets develop specialized knowledge on valuing assets traded in that market.

The primary market, where new issues of securities are offered to the public, is another example of a brokered market. In the primary market, investment bankers who market a firm's securities to the public act as brokers; they seek investors to purchase securities directly from the issuing corporation.

Dealer Markets When trading activity in a particular type of asset increases, dealer markets arise. Dealers specialize in various assets, purchase these assets for their own accounts, and later sell them for a profit from their inventory. The spreads between dealers' buy (or "bid") prices and sell (or "ask") prices are a source of profit. Dealer markets save traders on search costs because market participants can easily look up the prices at which they can buy from or sell to dealers. A fair amount of market activity is required before dealing in a market is an attractive source of income. Most bonds and most foreign exchange trade in over-the-counter dealer markets.

Auction Markets The most integrated market is an auction market, in which all traders converge at one place (either physically or "electronically") to buy or sell an asset.

# Concept Check 3.2

Many assets trade in more than one type of market. What types of markets do the following trade in?

a. Used cars b. Paintings
c. Rare coins

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is an example of an auction market. An advantage of auction markets over dealer markets is that one need not search across dealers to find the best price for a good. If all participants converge, they can arrive at mutually agreeable prices and save the bid-ask spread.

Notice that both over-the-counter dealer markets and stock exchanges are secondary markets. They are organized for investors to trade existing securities among themselves.

# Types of Orders

Before comparing alternative trading practices and competing security markets, it is helpful to begin with an overview of the types of trades an investor might wish to have executed in these markets. Broadly speaking, there are two types of orders: market orders and orders contingent on price.

Market Orders Market orders are buy or sell orders that are to be executed immediately at current market prices. For example, our investor might call her broker and ask for the market price of Apple. The broker might report back that the best bid price is  \$179.50 and the best ask price is\$ 179.54, meaning that the investor would need to pay \$179.54 to purchase a share, and could receive \$179.50 a share if she wished to sell some of her own holdings. The bid-ask spread in this case is $.04. So an order to buy 100 shares "at market" would result in purchase at \$179.54, and an order to "sell at market" would be executed at 179.50.

This simple scenario is subject to a few potential complications. First, posted price quotes actually represent commitments to trade up to a specified number of shares. If the market order is for more than this number of shares, the order may be filled at multiple prices. For example, if the ask price is good for orders up to 300 shares and the investor wishes to purchase 500 shares, it may be necessary to pay a slightly higher price for the last 200 shares. Figure 3.3 shows average depth over time. Notice that depth is considerably higher for large stocks than it is for smaller stocks. Depth is considered another component of liquidity. Second, another trader may beat our investor to the quote, meaning that her order would then be executed at a worse price. Finally, the best price quote may change before her order arrives, again causing execution at a price different from the one quoted at the moment of the order.

Price-Contingent Orders Investors also may place orders specifying prices at which they are willing to buy or sell a security. A limit buy order may instruct the broker to buy

Panel B: Large stocks (above  $95^{\text{th}}$  percentile market capitalization) some number of shares if and when Apple may be obtained at or below a stipulated price. Conversely, a limit sell instructs the broker to sell if and when the stock price rises above a specified limit. A collection of limit orders waiting to be executed is called a limit order book.

Notice that the best orders are at the top of the list: the offers to buy at the highest price and to sell at the lowest price. The buy and sell orders at the top of the list— \$286.95 and\$ 286.97—are called the inside quotes; they are the highest buy and lowest sell orders. The inside spread at this time was only 2 cents. However, order sizes at the inside quotes are generally small. Therefore, investors interested in larger trades face an effective spread greater than the nominal one because they cannot execute their entire trades at the inside price quotes.

# Concept Check 3.3

What type of trading order might you give to your broker in each of the following circumstances?

a. You want to buy shares of Microsoft to diversify your portfolio. You believe the share price is approximately at the "fair" value, and you want the trade done quickly and cheaply.
b. You want to buy shares of Microsoft, but you believe that the current stock price is too high given the firm's prospects. If the shares could be obtained at a price  $5\%$  lower than the current value, you would like to purchase shares for your portfolio.
c. You believe your shares of Microsoft are already priced generously, and you are inclined to sell them. But there is a chance that price fluctuations might result in a short-lived increase of a few dollars per share. If the share price were to rise by 4, you are convinced that it would be greatly overpriced and you would want to sell it immediately.

# Trading Mechanisms

An investor who wishes to buy or sell shares will place an order with a brokerage firm. The broker charges a commission for arranging the trade on the client's behalf. Brokers have several avenues by which they can execute that trade, that is, find a buyer or seller and arrange for the shares to be exchanged.

Broadly speaking, there are three trading systems employed in the United States: over-the-counter dealer markets, electronic communication networks, and specialist/designated market maker (DMM) markets. Electronic trading is by far the most prevalent, but the best-known markets such as NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange actually use a variety of trading procedures, so before you delve into specific markets, it is useful to understand the basic operation of each type of trading system.


Dealer Markets Tens of thousands of securities trade on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Thousands of brokers register with the SEC as security dealers. Dealers quote prices at which they are willing to buy or sell securities. A broker then executes a trade by contacting a dealer listing an attractive quote.

Before 1971, all OTC quotations were recorded manually and published daily on so-called pink sheets. In 1971, the National Association of Securities Dealers introduced its Automatic Quotations System, or NASDAQ, to link brokers and dealers in a computer network where price quotes could be displayed and revised. Dealers could use the network to display the bid price at which they were willing to purchase a security and the ask price at which they were willing to sell. The difference in these prices, the bid-ask spread, was the source of the dealer's profit. Brokers representing clients could examine quotes over the computer network, contact the dealer with the best quote, and execute a trade.

As originally organized, NASDAQ was more of a price-ration system than a trading system. While brokers could survey bid and ask prices across the network of dealers in the search for the best trading opportunity, actual trades required direct negotiation (often over the phone) between the investor's broker and the dealer in the security. However, as we will see, NASDAQ is no longer a mere price quotation system. While dealers still post bid and ask prices over the network, what is now called the NASDAQ Stock Market allows for automated electronic execution of trades, and the vast majority of trades are executed electronically.

Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) Electronic communication networks (ECNs) allow participants to post market and limit orders over computer networks. The limit-order book is available to all participants. An example of such an order book from CBOE Global Markets appears in Figure 3.4. Orders that can be "crossed," that is, matched against another order, are executed automatically without requiring the intervention of a broker. For example, an order to buy a share at a price of  \$50 or lower will be immediately executed if there is an outstanding ask price of\$ 50. Therefore, ECNs are true trading systems, not merely price-ration systems.

ECNs register with the SEC as broker-dealers and are subject to Regulation ATS (for Alternative Trading System). ECN subscribers, who can bring trades directly to the network, are typically institutional investors, broker-dealers, and market makers (firms that post bid and ask prices for securities and commit to trading a specified number of shares at currently posted prices). Individual investors therefore must hire a broker who is a participant in the ECN to execute trades on their behalf.

ECNs offer several advantages. Trades are automatically crossed at a modest cost, typically less than a penny per share. ECNs are attractive as well because of the speed with which a trade can be executed. Finally, these systems offer traders considerable anonymity.

Specialist/DMM Markets A market maker is a trader that quotes both a bid and an ask price to the public. By standing ready to trade at those publicly quoted prices, market makers provide liquidity to other traders, allowing them to move into and out of share positions quickly and cheaply.

A designated market maker (DMM) is a market maker that accepts the obligation to commit its own capital to provide quotes and help maintain a "fair and orderly market." The exchange's DMM is the official market maker for a particular security. For example, when the book of limit orders is so thin that the spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price becomes too wide, the DMM would be expected to post bid and ask prices at a narrower spread, offering to buy and sell shares from its own inventory. Similarly, DMMs are expected to offer trades that support the "weak" side of the market when there are imbalances in buy and sell orders. The trades that a DMM makes from or for its own inventory contribute to market depth, and DMM depth guidelines specify their obligation to support the market in this manner.

Designated market makers replaced what formerly were called specialist firms at the NYSE. In return for assuming their obligations, DMMs are given some advantages in trade execution. However, unlike the specialist firms that they replaced, they are not given advanced looks at the trading orders of other market participants.

While most trading on the NYSE is electronic, the exchange touts the DMM system as offering a when-needed level of human intervention to maintain a smooth functioning market during periods of stress and high volatility. These services are most valuable at market open and close, when both trading volume and price volatility are highest.

# 3.3 The Rise of Electronic Trading

When first established, NASDAQ was primarily an over-the-counter dealer market and the NYSE was a specialist market. But today both are primarily electronic markets. These changes were driven by an interaction of new technologies and new regulations. New regulations allowed brokers to compete for business, broke the hold that dealers once had on information about best-available bid and ask prices, forced integration of markets, and allowed securities to trade in ever-smaller price increments (called tick sizes). Technology made it possible for traders to rapidly compare prices across markets and direct their trades to the markets with the best prices. The resulting competition drove down the cost of trade execution to a tiny fraction of its level just a few decades ago.

In 1975, fixed commissions on the NYSE were eliminated, which freed brokers to compete for business by lowering their fees. In that year also, Congress amended the Securities Exchange Act to create the National Market System to at least partially centralize trading across exchanges and enhance competition among different market makers. The idea was to implement centralized reporting of transactions as well as a centralized price quotation system to give traders a broader view of trading opportunities across markets.

The aftermath of a 1994 scandal at NASDAQ turned out to be a major impetus in the further evolution and integration of markets. NASDAQ dealers were found to be colluding to maintain wide bid-ask spreads. For example, if a stock was listed at  $30 bid-$ 30½ ask, a retail client who wished to buy shares from a dealer would pay  $\$30 \frac{1}{2}$  while a client who wished to sell shares would receive only  $\$30$ . The dealer would pocket the  $\frac{1}{2}$ -point spread as profit. Other traders may have been willing to step in with better prices (e.g., they may have been willing to buy shares for  $\$30 \frac{1}{8}$  or sell them for  $\$30 \frac{3}{8}$ ), but those better quotes were not made available to the public, enabling dealers to profit from artificially wide spreads at the public's expense. When these practices came to light, an antitrust lawsuit was brought against NASDAQ.

In response to the scandal, the SEC instituted new order-handling rules. Published dealer quotes now had to reflect limit orders of customers, allowing them to effectively compete with dealers to capture trades. As part of the antitrust settlement, NASDAQ agreed to integrate quotes from ECNs into its public display, enabling the electronic exchanges to also compete for trades. Shortly after this settlement, the SEC adopted Regulation ATS (Alternative Trading Systems), giving ECNs the right to register as stock exchanges. Not surprisingly, they captured an ever-larger market share, and in the wake of this new competition, bid-ask spreads narrowed.


Even more dramatic narrowing of trading costs came in 1997, when the SEC allowed the minimum tick size to fall from one-eighth of a dollar to one-sixteenth. Not long after, in 2001, "decimalization" allowed the tick size to fall to 1 cent. Bid-ask spreads again fell dramatically. Figure 3.5 shows estimates of the "effective spread" (the cost of a transaction) during three distinct time periods defined by the minimum tick size. Notice how dramatically effective spread falls along with the minimum tick size. By 2015, quoted bid-ask spreads on large stocks were typically only 1 cent. Across all stocks, the median spread was about 5 cents.

Technology was also changing trading practices. The first ECN, Instinet, was established in 1969. By the 1990s, exchanges around the world were rapidly adopting fully electronic trading systems. Europe led the way in this evolution, but eventually American exchanges followed suit. The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) spun off the NASDAQ Stock Market as a separate entity in 2000, which quickly evolved into a centralized limit-order matching system—effectively a large ECN. The NYSE acquired the electronic Archipelago Exchange in 2006 and renamed it NYSE Arca.

Figure 3.5 The effective spread (measured in dollars per share) fell dramatically as the minimum tick size fell (value-weighted average of NYSE-listed shares)

In 2005, the SEC adopted Regulation NMS (for National Market System), which was fully implemented in 2007. The goal was to link exchanges electronically, thereby creating, in effect, one integrated electronic market. The regulation required exchanges to honor quotes of other exchanges when they could be executed automatically. An exchange that could not handle a quote electronically would be labeled a "slow market" under Reg NMS and could be ignored by other market participants. The NYSE, which was still devoted to the specialist system, was particularly at risk of being passed over, and in response to this pressure, it moved aggressively toward automated execution of trades. Electronic trading networks and the integration of markets in the wake of Reg NMS made it much easier for exchanges around the world to compete; the NYSE lost its effective monopoly in the trading of its own listed stocks, and by the end of the decade, its share in the trading of NYSE-listed stocks fell from about  $75\%$  to  $20\%$ .

Trading today is overwhelmingly electronic, at least for stocks. Bonds are still traded in more traditional dealer markets.

# 3.4 U.S. Markets

The NYSE and the NASDAQ Stock Market remain the best-known U.S. stock markets. But electronic communication networks have steadily increased their market share. Figure 3.6 shows the comparative trading volume of NYSE-listed shares on the NYSE and NASDAQ as well as on the major ECNs, namely, BATS, NYSE Arca, and Direct Edge. (Since this study was published, BATS and Direct Edge merged, creating one of the world's largest stock exchanges, called BATS Global Markets, which was, in turn, acquired by the CBOE.)

The "Other" category, which now approximates  $40\%$ , includes so-called dark pools and "internalization" of order flow by brokerage firms, both of which we will discuss shortly.

# NASDAQ

The NASDAQ Stock Market lists around 3,000 firms. It has steadily introduced ever-more sophisticated trading platforms, which today handle the great majority of its trades. Its NASDAQ Market Center consolidates NASDAQ's previous electronic markets into one integrated system. NASDAQ merged in 2007 with OMX, a Swedish-Finnish company that controls seven Nordic and Baltic stock exchanges, to form NASDAQ OMX Group. In addition to maintaining the NASDAQ Stock Market, it also maintains several stock markets in Europe as well as an options and futures exchange in the U.S.

NASDAQ has three levels of subscribers. The highest, level 3 subscribers, are registered market makers. These are firms that make a market in securities, maintain inventories of securities, and post bid and ask prices at which they commit to buy or sell shares. Level 3 subscribers can enter and change bid-ask quotes continually and have the fastest execution of trades. They profit from the spread between bid and ask prices.

Level 2 subscribers receive all bid and ask quotes but cannot enter their own quotes. They can see which market makers are offering the best prices. These subscribers tend to be brokerage firms that execute trades for clients but do not actively deal in stocks for their own account.

Level 1 subscribers receive only inside quotes (i.e., the best bid and ask prices) but do not see how many shares are being offered. These subscribers tend to be investors who are not actively buying or selling but want information on current prices.

# The New York Stock Exchange

The NYSE is the largest U.S. stock exchange as measured by the market value of listed stocks. Daily trading volume on the NYSE commonly exceeds 3 billion shares.

In 2006, the NYSE merged with the Archipelago Exchange to form a publicly held company called the NYSE Group, and then in 2007, it merged with the European exchange Euronext to form NYSE Euronext. The firm acquired the American Stock Exchange in 2008, which was renamed NYSE Amex and focuses on small firms. NYSE Arca is the firm's electronic communications network, and this is where the bulk of exchange-traded funds trade. In 2013, NYSE Euronext was purchased by InternationalExchange (ICE). ICE has retained the NYSE Euronext name.

The NYSE was long committed to its specialist trading system, which relied heavily on human participation in trade execution. It began its transition to electronic trading for smaller trades in 1976 with the introduction of its DOT (Designated Order Turnaround), and later SuperDOT, systems, which could route orders directly to the specialist. In 2000, the exchange launched Direct+, which could automatically cross smaller trades (up to 1,099 shares) without human intervention, and in 2004, it began eliminating the size restrictions on Direct+ trades. The change of emphasis dramatically accelerated in 2006 with the introduction of the NYSE Hybrid Market, which allowed brokers to send orders either for immediate electronic execution or to the specialist, who could seek price improvement from another trader. The Hybrid system allowed the NYSE to qualify as a fast market for the purposes of Regulation NMS, but still offer the advantages of human intervention for more complicated trades. In contrast, NYSE's Arca marketplace is fully electronic.

# ECNs

Over time, more fully automated markets have gained market share at the expense of less automated ones, in particular, the NYSE. Brokers that have an affiliation with an ECN have computer access and can enter orders in the limit order book. As orders are received, the system determines whether there is a matching order, and if so, the trade is immediately crossed.


Originally, ECNs were open only to other traders using the same system. But following the implementation of Reg NMS, ECNs began listing limit orders on other networks. Traders could use their computer systems to sift through the limit order books of many ECNs and instantaneously route orders to the market with the best prices. Those cross-market links have become the impetus for one of the more popular strategies of so-called high-frequency traders, which seek to profit from even small, transitory discrepancies in prices across markets. Speed is obviously of the essence here, and ECNs compete in terms of the speed they can offer. Latency refers to the time it takes to accept, process, and deliver a trading order. For example, CBOE Global Markets, which acquired the BATS platform, advertises average latency times of around 100 microseconds (i.e., .0001 second).

# 3.5 New Trading Strategies

The marriage of electronic trading mechanisms with computer technology has had far-ranging impacts on trading strategies and tools. Algorithmic trading delegates trading decisions to computer programs. High-frequency trading is a special class of algorithmic trading in which computer programs initiate orders in tiny fractions of a second, far faster than any human could process the information driving the trade. Much of the market liquidity that once was provided by brokers making a market in a security has been displaced by these high-frequency traders. But when high-frequency traders abandon the market, as in the so-called flash crash of 2010, liquidity can likewise evaporate in a flash. Dark pools are trading venues that preserve anonymity, but also affect market liquidity. We will address these emerging issues later in this section.

# Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic trading is the use of computer programs to make trading decisions. Well more than half of all equity volume in the United States is believed to be initiated by computer algorithms. Many of these trades exploit very small discrepancies in security prices and entail numerous and rapid cross-market price comparisons that are well suited to computer analysis. These strategies would not have been feasible before decimalization of the minimum tick size.

Some algorithmic trades attempt to exploit very-short-term trends (as short as a few seconds or less) as new information about a firm, or, more controversially, about the intentions of other traders, becomes available. Others use versions of pairs trading in which normal price relations between pairs (or larger groups) of stocks seem temporarily disrupted and offer small profit opportunities as they move back into alignment. Still others attempt to exploit discrepancies between stock prices and prices of stock-index futures contracts.

Some algorithmic trading involves activities akin to traditional market making. The traders seek to profit from the bid-ask spread by buying a stock at the bid price and rapidly selling it at the ask price before the price can change. While this mimics the role of a market maker who provides liquidity to other traders in the stock, these algorithmic traders are not registered market makers and so do not have an affirmative obligation to maintain both bid and ask quotes. If they abandon a market during a period of turbulence, the shock to market liquidity can be disruptive. This seems to have been

At 2:42 New York time on May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was already down about 300 points for the day. The market was demonstrating concerns about the European debt crisis, and nerves were on edge. Then, in the next 5 minutes, the Dow dropped an additional 600 points. And only 20 minutes after that, it had recovered most of those 600 points. Besides the staggering intraday volatility of the broad market, trading in individual shares and ETFs was even more disrupted. The iShares Russell 1000 Value fund temporarily fell from  \$59 a share to 8 cents. Shares in the large consulting company Accenture, which had just sold for\$ 38, traded at 1 cent only a minute or two later. At the other extreme, price quotes for Apple and Hewlett-Packard momentarily increased to over 100,000. These markets were clearly broken.

The causes of the flash crash are still debated. An SEC report issued after the trade pointed to a 4 billion sale of market index futures contracts by a mutual fund. As market prices began to tumble, many algorithmic trading programs withdrew from the markets, and those that remained became net sellers, further pushing down equity prices. As more and more of these algorithmic traders shut down, liquidity in these markets evaporated: Buyers for many stocks simply disappeared.

Finally, trading was halted for a short period. When it resumed, buyers decided to take advantage of many severely depressed stock prices, and the market rebounded almost as quickly as it had crashed. Given the intraday turbulence and the clearly distorted prices at which some trades had been executed, the NYSE and NASDAQ decided to cancel all trades that were executed more than  $60\%$  away from a "reference price" close to the opening price of the day. Almost  $70\%$  of those canceled trades involved ETFs.


The SEC has since experimented with new circuit breakers to halt trading during periods of "excessive" volatility. The idea is to prevent trading algorithms from moving share prices quickly before human traders have a chance to determine whether those prices are moving in response to fundamental information.

Currently, various thresholds set off market halts of varying duration. For example, a  $7\%$  decline in the S&P 500 (before 3:25 p.m.) halts trading for 15 minutes whereas a  $20\%$  decline halts trading for the remainder of the day. In addition a limit-up, limit-down rule prevents individual stocks from trading outside of time-varying price bands determined by percentage spreads (for example,  $5\%$  or  $10\%$  depending on the security) above or below the average security price in the preceding five-minute period.

The flash crash highlighted the fragility of markets in the face of huge variation in trading volume created by algorithmic traders. The potential for these high-frequency traders to withdraw from markets in periods of turbulence remains a concern, and many observers are not convinced that we are protected from future flash crashes.

a problem during the flash crash of May 6, 2010, when the stock market encountered extreme volatility, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling by 1,000 points before recovering around 600 points in intraday trading. The nearby box discusses this amazing and troubling episode.

# High-Frequency Trading

It is easy to see that many algorithmic trading strategies require extremely rapid trade initiation and execution. High-frequency trading is a subset of algorithmic trading that relies on computer programs to make extremely rapid decisions. High-frequency traders compete for trades that offer very small profits. But if those opportunities are numerous enough, they can accumulate to big money.

We pointed out that one high-frequency strategy entails a sort of market making, attempting to profit from the bid-ask spread. Another relies on cross-market arbitrage, in which even tiny price discrepancies across markets allow the firm to buy a security at one price and simultaneously sell it at a slightly higher price. The competitive advantage in these strategies lies with the firms that are quickest to identify and execute these profit opportunities. There is a tremendous premium on being the first to "hit" a bid or ask price.

Other strategies combine artificial intelligence with high-speed trading. For example, some hedge firms use electronic news feeds along with natural language processing. They can compare earnings (or other) announcements to consensus forecasts to infer the "good" or "bad" nature of news about a firm. The hope is to be the first to trade on the announcement—which requires the program to receive, interpret, and act on the announcement faster than any human could. Another strategy might be dubbed "electronic front running," where the fund uses artificial intelligence along with trading data to infer buy/sell programs of other traders and to buy or sell ahead of them before their trades move market prices.


Trade execution times for high-frequency traders are now measured in milliseconds, even microseconds. This has induced trading firms to "co-locate" their trading centers next to the computer systems of the electronic exchanges. When execution or latency periods are less than a millisecond, the extra time it takes for a trade order to travel from a remote location to a New York exchange would be enough to make it nearly impossible to win the trade.

To understand why co-location has become a key issue, consider this calculation. Even light can travel only 186 miles in one millisecond, so an order originating in Chicago transmitted at the speed of light would take almost five milliseconds to reach New York. But ECNs today claim latency periods considerably less than one millisecond, so an order from Chicago could not possibly compete with one launched from a co-located facility.

In some ways, co-location is a new version of an old phenomenon. Think about why, even before the advent of the telephone, so many brokerage firms originally located their headquarters in New York: They were "co-locating" with the NYSE so that their brokers could bring trades (on foot!) to the exchange quickly and efficiently. Today, trades are transmitted electronically, but competition among traders for fast execution means that the need to be near the market (now embodied in computer servers) remains.

# Dark Pools

Many large traders seek anonymity. They fear that if others see them executing a large buy or sell program, their intentions will become public and prices will move against them. This is a particular concern with large orders that will be executed over time using several trades. Very large trades (called blocks, usually defined as a trade of more than 10,000 shares) traditionally were brought to "block houses," brokerage firms specializing in matching block buyers and sellers. Part of the expertise of block brokers is in identifying traders who might be interested in a large purchase or sale if given an offer. These brokers discreetly arrange large trades out of the public eye, and so avoid moving prices against their clients.

Block trading today has been largely displaced by dark pools, private trading systems in which participants can buy or sell large blocks of securities without showing their hand. Limit orders are not visible to the general public as they would be on a conventional exchange, and traders' identities can also be kept private. Trades are not reported until after they are crossed, which limits the vulnerability to other traders anticipating one's trading program.

Rather than cross limit orders, many dark pools simply accept "unpriced orders" and match buyers with sellers at the midpoint of the bid and ask prices reported on other markets. These orders are therefore somewhat like market orders. However, because these orders never appear in the consolidated limit order book (displaying so-called national best bid and offer, or NBBO, prices), they do not contribute to "price discovery," that is, help the price reflect all publicly available information about demand for the security. For this reason, dark pools have been criticized as exacerbating the fragmentation of markets.

Many large traders gravitate toward dark pools because it makes them less vulnerable to high-frequency traders. They want a trading venue where other traders find it more difficult to infer their trading intentions and trade in front of them. Many dark pools claim to exclude better-informed traders such as hedge funds. However, this ideal has not always been realized. In 2011, Pipeline LLC, which operated a dark pool, was accused of enabling high-frequency traders to participate in its market and to gauge the intentions of other participants in the pool. Similarly, in 2014, Barclays was accused of misrepresenting the level of high-frequency trading in a dark pool that it operated. There are lingering concerns regarding the extent to which dark pools provide the protections from other traders that they are purportedly designed to offer.


Another approach to dealing with large trades is to split them into many small trades, each of which can be executed on electronic markets, attempting to hide the fact that the total number of shares ultimately to be bought or sold is large. This trend has led to rapid decline in average trade size; while average trade size in 2004 was about 1,000 shares, today it is only about 200 shares.

# Internalization

In addition to dark pools, order internalization represents a second major drain of trades away from exchanges. This refers to the practice by brokers of matching buy and sell orders internally rather than bringing them to exchanges. By so doing, the brokerage captures the bid-ask spread for itself and, in addition, avoids paying exchange access fees. These are fees charged by exchanges for so-called maker/taker pricing. Market orders that "take" liquidity (i.e., access the limit order book) pay an access fee of about .3 cents per share, while limit orders that provide or "make" liquidity for market orders receive a rebate of .2 cents per share. (The exchange gets the other .1 cent.) Brokers thus can profit from their customers' order flow. As Figure 3.6 illustrates, the share of trading that now occurs off exchanges (the Other category in the figure), now accounts for about  $40\%$  of trades and creates concerns that market fragmentation means that market prices may not reflect the full picture of supply and demand for a stock.

# Bond Trading

In 2006, the NYSE obtained regulatory approval to expand its bond-trading system to include the debt issues of any NYSE-listed firm. Until then, each bond needed to be registered before listing, and such a requirement was too onerous to justify listing most bonds. In conjunction with these new listings, the NYSE has expanded its electronic bond-trading platform.

Nevertheless, the vast majority of bond trading occurs in the OTC market among bond dealers, even for bonds that are actually listed on the NYSE. This market is a network of bond dealers such as Merrill Lynch (now part of Bank of America), Salomon Smith Barney (a division of Citigroup), and Goldman Sachs that is linked by a computer quotation system. However, because these dealers do not carry extensive inventories of the wide range of bonds that have been issued to the public, they cannot necessarily offer to sell bonds from their inventory to clients or even buy bonds for their own inventory.

New electronic trading platforms, for example, MarketAxess, now exist to directly connect buyers and sellers. But these platforms have not yet displaced the traditional dealer market. One of the impediments to heavy electronic trading is lack of standardization in the bond market. A single company may have outstanding dozens of different bond issues, differing by coupon, maturity, and seniority. Any one of these bonds may trade only a few times a year. Given the great diversity of bond issues and the often sporadic trading activity of bond investors, even these electronic platforms rely for liquidity on participation by investment banks that are willing to act as dealers, maintaining inventories to be matched against investor orders. In the aftermath of the financial crisis and reduced capacity for risk taking, however, banks have pulled back from this role. In practice, therefore, the corporate bond market often is quite "thin," in that there may be few investors interested in trading a specific bond at any particular time. As a result, the bond market is subject to a type of liquidity risk, for it can be difficult to sell one's holdings quickly if the need arises.

# 3.6 Globalization of Stock Markets

Figure 3.7 shows the market capitalization of firms listed on major stock exchanges around the world. By this measure, the NYSE Euronext is the largest equity market. All major stock markets today are effectively electronic.

Securities markets have come under increasing pressure in recent years to make international alliances or mergers. Much of this pressure is due to the impact of electronic trading. To a growing extent, traders view stock markets as computer networks that link them to other traders, and there are increasingly fewer limits on the securities around the world that they can trade. Against this background, it becomes more important for exchanges to provide the cheapest and most efficient mechanism by which trades can be executed and cleared. This argues for global alliances that can facilitate the nuts and bolts of cross-border trading and benefit from economies of scale. Exchanges feel that they eventually need to offer 24-hour global markets and platforms that allow trading of different security types, for example, both stocks and derivatives. Finally, companies want to be able to go beyond national borders when they wish to raise capital.

These pressures have resulted in a broad trend toward market consolidation. After a wave of mergers in the last two decades, the industry now has a few giant security exchanges: ICE (Intercontinental Exchange, operating NYSE Euronext and several commodity futures and options markets), NASDAQ, the LSE (London Stock Exchange Group), Deutsche Boerse, the CME Group (largely options and futures trading), TSE (Tokyo Stock Exchange), and HKEX (Hong Kong Stock Exchange).

# 3.7 Trading Costs

Part of the cost of trading a security is obvious and explicit. Your broker must be paid a commission. Individuals may choose from two kinds of brokers: full-service or discount. Full-service brokers who provide a variety of services often are referred to as account executives or financial consultants.

Besides carrying out the basic services of executing orders, holding securities for safekeeping, extending margin loans, and facilitating short sales, brokers routinely provide information and advice relating to investment alternatives.

Full-service brokers usually depend on a research staff that prepares analyses and forecasts of general economic as well as industry and company conditions and often makes specific buy or sell recommendations. Some customers take the ultimate leap of faith and allow a full-service broker to make buy and sell decisions for them by establishing a discretionary account, which allows the broker to trade securities whenever deemed fit. (The broker cannot withdraw any funds, though.) This action requires an unusual degree of trust on the part of the customer, for an unscrupulous broker can "churn" an account, that is, trade securities excessively with the sole purpose of generating commissions.

Discount brokers, on the other hand, provide "no-frills" services. They buy and sell securities, hold them for safekeeping, offer margin loans, and facilitate short sales—that is all. The only information they provide about the securities they handle is price quotations. Discount brokerage services have become increasingly available in recent years. Many banks, thrift institutions, and mutual fund management companies now offer such services to the investing public as part of a general trend toward the creation of one-stop "financial supermarkets."

Stock trading fees have fallen steadily and dramatically in the last three decades. In fact, several brokerage firms, among them Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade (which was acquired by Schwab in 2020), E*Trade, Fidelity, and Vanguard, have reduced their trading commissions to zero. What then is their profit model? To a large extent, online brokers typically earn considerably more interest than they pay to customers on the funds kept in brokerage accounts. They also may hope to establish relationships with customers who will pay for financial advice. By 2020, commissions accounted for less than  $10\%$  of revenues at Schwab.

Finally, brokers generate income from payment for order flow. This entails passing along customers' orders for execution to high-frequency traders who are willing to pay for those orders because it gives them the opportunity to profit from the bid-ask spread. Payment for order flow is controversial because it potentially presents a conflict of interest for brokers, who might be tempted to sell an order for payment rather than work for the best execution of the trade. On the other hand, it is plausible that at least some of the payment for order flow is passed along to retail customers in the form of lower commissions, and that this practice may be responsible for part of the dramatic reduction in brokerage fees in the last few decades. Moreover, firms engaging in payment for order flow point out that SEC rules prohibit purchasers of order flow from executing trades at prices worse than the national best bid or offer prices available on exchanges, so they argue that investors are not hurt by the practice.

As payment for order flow would suggest, in addition to the explicit part of trading costs—the broker's commission—there is an implicit part—the dealer's bid-ask spread. The spread can range from just a cent or so for the largest stocks, to about 5 cents for average-sized stocks, to considerably more for small stocks. The spread is the main source of profit to dealers in the stock, who advertise their willingness to buy from the public at the

(lower) bid price and sell at the (higher) ask price. More heavily traded stocks, where dealers can unwind positions easily and cheaply, command smaller spreads. But beyond that, there is an important information story that explains why larger, better-known companies enjoy smaller spreads.

Dealers who post bid or ask prices are vulnerable to a type of adverse selection problem: if their posted prices are too low, for example, they will receive many buy orders and sell their shares at bargain prices. In other words, they will attract the most trading interest exactly when their posted prices are wrong. Even if their posted prices are initially "correct," they are vulnerable to information events that can quickly make those prices out of date. The dealer has effectively issued a free option to other traders to initiate a trade only when it is advantageous to them. The dealer thus has to trade off the profit from the bid-ask spread against the expected loss from dealing with more sophisticated traders who can take advantage of misaligned price quotes.

Thus, we would expect to see that well-known stocks, for which information is abundant, have lower spreads. Smaller, lesser-known, and less-researched stocks, which are subject to larger potential shocks from previously unanticipated information releases, should have higher spreads. And that is exactly what we observe in the marketplace.

Another implicit cost of trading that some observers would distinguish is the price concession an investor may be forced to make for trading in quantities greater than those associated with the posted bid or ask price.

# 3.8 Buying on Margin

When purchasing securities, investors have easy access to a source of debt financing called broker's call loans. Taking advantage of these loans is called buying on margin.

Purchasing stocks on margin means the investor borrows part of the purchase price. The margin in the account is the portion of the purchase price contributed by the investor; the remainder is borrowed from the broker. The brokers in turn borrow money from banks at the call money rate to finance these purchases; they then charge their clients that rate (defined in Chapter 2), plus a service charge. All securities purchased on margin must be maintained with the brokerage firm in street name, for the securities are collateral for the loan.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System limits the extent to which stock purchases can be financed using margin loans. The initial margin requirement is  $50\%$ , meaning that at least  $50\%$  of the purchase price must be paid for in cash, with the rest borrowed.

# Example 3.1 Margin

The percentage margin is defined as the ratio of the net worth, or the "equity value," of the account to the market value of the securities. To illustrate, suppose an investor initially pays \$6,000 toward the purchase of \$10,000 worth of stock (100 shares at \$100 per share), borrowing the remaining \$4,000 from a broker. The initial balance sheet looks like this:

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities and Owners’ Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Value of stock</td><td>\$10,000</td><td>Loan from broker</td><td>\$4,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Equity</td><td>6,000</td></tr></table>

The initial percentage margin is

$$
\text {Margin} = \frac {\text {Equity in account}}{\text {Value of stock}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 6 , 0 0 0}{\mathbb {S} 1 0 , 0 0 0} = . 6 0, \text {or} 6 0
$$

If the price declines to 70 per share, the account balance becomes

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities and Owners’ Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Value of stock</td><td>\$7,000</td><td>Loan from broker</td><td>\$4,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Equity</td><td>3,000</td></tr></table>

The assets in the account fall by the full decrease in the stock value, as does the equity. The percentage margin is now

$$
\text {M a r g i n} = \frac {\text {E q u i t y i n a c c o u n t}}{\text {V a l u e o f s t o c k}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 3 , 0 0 0}{\mathbb {S} 7 , 0 0 0} = . 4 3, \text {o r} 4 3
$$

If the stock value in Example 3.1 were to fall below 4,000, owners' equity would become negative, meaning the value of the stock would no longer provide sufficient collateral to cover the loan from the broker. To guard against this possibility, the broker sets a maintenance margin. If the percentage margin falls below the maintenance level, the broker will issue a margin call, which requires the investor to add new cash or securities to the margin account. If the investor does not act, the broker may sell securities from the account to pay off enough of the loan to restore the percentage margin to an acceptable level.

# Example 3.2 Maintenance Margin

Continuing the scenario presented in Example 3.1, suppose the maintenance margin is  $30\%$ . How far could the stock price fall before the investor would get a margin call?

Let  $P$  be the price of the stock. The value of the investor's 100 shares is then 100P, and the equity in the account is 100P - \$4,000. The percentage margin is (100P - \$4,000)/100P. The price at which the percentage margin equals the maintenance margin of .3 is found by solving the equation

$$
\frac {1 0 0 P - 4 , 0 0 0}{1 0 0 P} = . 3
$$ which implies that  $P = \$57.14$ . If the price of the stock falls below  $\$57.14$  per share, the investor will receive a margin call.

# Concept Check 3.4

Suppose the maintenance margin in Example 3.2 is  $40\%$ . How far can the stock price fall before the investor gets a margin call?

The following Excel spreadsheet, available in Connect or through your course instructor, makes it easy to analyze the impacts of different margin levels and the volatility of stock prices. It also allows you to compare return on investment for a margin trade with a trade using no borrowed funds.

# Excel Questions

1. Suppose you buy 100 shares of stock initially selling for \$50, borrowing  $25\%$  of the necessary funds from your broker (i.e., the initial margin on your purchase is  $25\%$ ). You pay an interest rate of  $8\%$  on margin loans.


a. How much of your own money do you invest? How much do you borrow from your broker?

Why do investors buy securities on margin? They do so when they wish to invest an amount greater than their own money allows. Thus, they can achieve greater upside potential, but they also expose themselves to greater downside risk.

To see how, let's suppose an investor is bullish on FinCorp stock, which is selling for  \$100 per share. An investor with\$ 10,000 to invest expects FinCorp to go up in price by 30\% during the next year. Ignoring dividends, the expected rate of return would be 30\% if the investor invested 10,000 to buy 100 shares.

But now assume the investor borrows another  \$10,000 from the broker and invests it in FinCorp, too. The total investment would be\$ 20,000 (for 200 shares). Assuming an interest rate on the margin loan of 9\% per year, what will the investor's rate of return be (again ignoring dividends) if the stock price increases 30\% by year's end?

The 200 shares will be worth  \$26,000. Paying off\$ 10,900 of principal and interest on the margin loan leaves $15,100 (i.e., $26,000 - 10,900). The rate of return in this case will be

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 15 , 100 - \mathbb {S} 10 , 000}{\mathbb {S} 10 , 000} = 51 \%
$$

<table><tr><td>Change in Stock Price</td><td>End-of-Year Value of Shares</td><td>Repayment of Principal and Interest*</td><td>Investor&#x27;s Rate of Return</td></tr><tr><td>30\% increase</td><td>$26,000</td><td>$10,900</td><td>51\%</td></tr><tr><td>No change</td><td>20,000</td><td>10,900</td><td>-9</td></tr><tr><td>30\% decrease</td><td>14,000</td><td>10,900</td><td>-69</td></tr></table>

* Assuming the investor buys \$20,000 worth of stock, borrowing \$10,000 of the purchase price at an interest rate of 9\% per year.

# Table 3.1

Illustration of buying stock on margin

The investor has parlayed a  $30\%$  rise in the stock's price into a  $51\%$  rate of return on the 10,000 investment.

Doing so, however, magnifies the downside risk. Suppose that, instead of going up by 30\%, the stock price drops by 30\% to \$70 per share. In that case, the 200 shares will be worth \$14,000, and the investor is left with \$3,100 after paying off the \$10,900 of principal and interest on the loan. The result is a disastrous return of

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 3 , 100 - \mathbb {S} 10 , 000}{\mathbb {S} 10 , 000} = - 69 \%
$$

Table 3.1 summarizes the possible results of these hypothetical transactions. If there is no change in the stock price, the investor loses  $9\%$ , the cost of the loan.

# Concept Check 3.5

Suppose that in the FinCorp example, the investor borrows only 5,000 at the same interest rate of 9 \%per year. What will the rate of return be if the stock price increases by 30 \%? If it falls by 30 \%? If it remains unchanged?

# 3.9 Short Sales

Normally, an investor would first buy a stock and later sell it. With a short sale, the order is reversed. First, you sell and then you buy the shares. In both cases, you begin and end with no shares.

A short sale allows investors to profit from a decline in a security's price. An investor borrows a share of stock from a broker and sells it. Later, the short-seller must purchase a share of the same stock in order to replace the one that was borrowed. This is called covering the short position. Table 3.2 compares stock purchases to short sales.

# Table 3.2

Cash flows from purchasing versus short-selling shares of stock

<table><tr><td colspan="3">Purchase of Stock</td></tr><tr><td>Time</td><td>Action</td><td>Cash Flow*</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Buy share</td><td>– Initial price</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Receive dividend, sell share</td><td>Ending price + Dividend</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Profit = (Ending price + Dividend) – Initial price</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Short Sale of Stock</td></tr><tr><td>Time</td><td>Action</td><td>Cash Flow*</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Borrow share; sell it</td><td>+ Initial price</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Repay dividend and buy share to replace the share originally borrowed</td><td>– (Ending price + Dividend)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Profit = Initial price – (Ending price + Dividend)</td></tr></table>

$^{*}$ A negative cash flow implies a cash outflow.

The short-seller anticipates the stock price will fall, so that the share can be purchased later at a lower price than it initially sold for; if so, the short-seller will reap a profit. Short-sellers must not only replace the shares but also pay the lender of the security any dividends paid during the short sale.

In practice, the shares loaned out for a short sale are typically provided by the short-seller's brokerage firm, which holds a wide variety of securities of its other investors in street name (i.e., the broker holds the shares registered in its own name on behalf of the client). The owner of the shares need not know that the shares have been lent to the short-seller. If the owner wishes to sell the shares, the brokerage firm will simply borrow shares from another investor. Therefore, the short sale may have an indefinite term. However, if the brokerage firm cannot locate new shares to replace the ones sold, the short-seller will need to repay the loan immediately by purchasing shares in the market and turning them over to the brokerage house to close out the loan. The short seller is at risk if the shares are not readily available, as shorts in GameStop painfully learned in 2021. See the nearby box.

Finally, exchange rules require that proceeds from a short sale must be kept on account with the broker. The short-seller cannot invest these funds to generate income, although large or institutional investors typically will receive some income from the proceeds of a short sale being held with the broker. Short-sellers also are required to post margin (cash or collateral) with the broker to cover losses should the stock price rise during the short sale.

# Example 3.3 Short Sales

To illustrate the mechanics of short-selling, suppose you are bearish (pessimistic) on Dot Bomb stock, and its market price is 100 per share. You tell your broker to sell short 1,000 shares. The broker borrows 1,000 shares either from another customer's account or from another broker.

The  $\$ 100,000$ cash proceeds from the short sale are credited to your account. Suppose the broker has a  $50 \%$ margin requirement on short sales. This means you must have other cash or securities in your account worth at least  $\$ 50,000$ that can serve as margin on the

In late 2020, GameStop was a little-known, struggling company selling computer games in brick-and-mortar stores. Its stock price was declining, and several hedge funds and institutional traders were shorting its shares. But when the former CEO of Chewy joined the board, its prospects seemed to brighten. The company suddenly became a "mime stock," commanding incredible interest on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets, and emerging as a favorite of traders on the app-based brokerage Robinhood. The enthusiasm of these traders drove the stock price up from about  \$17 at the beginning of January 2021 to an intraday high price of\$ 438 on January 28.

As the stock price rose throughout the month, the hedge funds viewed the firm as even more overpriced, and they increased their short positions. By the third week of January, more than  $100\%$  of the public float in GameStop had been sold short. But as the price continued to rise, the losses on the short positions soared, until finally, the hedge funds decided to close out their shorts. By now, however, it was too late, for a short squeeze had occurred in which there were not enough shares available to satisfy all the shorts that wanted to liquidate their positions. Failure to deliver triggers daily penalties that continue until the shares needed to close out the short position are returned. Moreover, the r/WallStreetBets users were encouraging each other to hold on to their shares (which would exacerbate the short squeeze) to further punish the institutional traders. The losses to short sellers were dramatic, reportedly around 6 billion.


The frenzy ended as dramatically as it began. When the clearinghouse that handles stock trades required Robinhood to come up with additional collateral, the brokerage halted trading of several companies, including GameStop. By the time trading on Robinhood reopened, the stock had declined precipitously, closing below 100 a share on February 2, just about where it stands more than a year later in May 2022.

short sale. Let's say that you have 50,000 in Treasury bills. Your account with the broker after the short sale will then be

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities and Owners&#x27; Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>\$100,000</td><td>Short position in Dot Bomb stock (1,000 shares owed)</td><td>\$100,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>T-bills</td><td>50,000</td><td>Equity</td><td>50,000</td><td></td></tr></table>

Your initial percentage margin is the ratio of the equity in the account,  \ {50},{000}  ,to the current value of the shares you have borrowed and eventually must return,  \$ {100},{000}  :

$$
\text {P e r c e n t a g e} = \frac {\text {E q u i t y}}{\text {V a l u e o f s t o c k o w e d}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 5 0 , 0 0 0}{\mathbb {S} 1 0 0 , 0 0 0} = . 5 0
$$

Suppose you are right and Dot Bomb falls to \$70 per share. You can now close out your position at a profit. To cover the short sale, you buy 1,000 shares to replace the ones you borrowed. Because the shares now sell for \$70, the purchase costs only \$70,000. Because your account was credited for \$100,000 when the shares were borrowed and sold, your profit is 30,000: The profit equals the decline in the share price times the number of shares sold short.

Like investors who purchase stock on margin, a short-seller must be concerned about margin calls. If the stock price rises, the margin in the account will fall; if margin falls to the maintenance level, the short-seller will receive a margin call.

This Excel spreadsheet model was built using Example 3.3 for Dot Bomb. The model allows you to analyze the effects of returns, margin calls, and different levels of initial and maintenance margins. The model also includes a sensitivity analysis for the ending stock price and return on investment.

# Example 3.4 Margin Calls on Short Positions

Suppose the broker has a maintenance margin of  $30\%$  on short sales. This means the equity in your account must be at least  $30\%$  of the value of your short position at all times. How much can the price of Dot Bomb stock rise before you get a margin call?

Let  P  be the price of Dot Bomb stock. Then the value of the shares you must pay back is  1,000P  and the equity in your account is  \ {150},{000} - 1,{000P}  . Your short position margin ratio is Equity/Value of stock  = \left( {{150},{000} - 1,{000P}}\right) /1,{000P}  . The critical value of  P  is thus

$$
\frac {\text {E q u i t y}}{\text {V a l u e o f s h a r e s o w e d}} = \frac {1 5 0 , 0 0 0 - 1 , 0 0 0 P}{1 , 0 0 0 P} = . 3
$$ which implies that  P = \115.38  per share. If Dot Bomb stock should rise above  \$115.38  per share, you will get a margin call, and you will either have to put up additional cash or cover your short position by buying shares to replace the ones borrowed.


# Short-Selling Comes Under Fire—Again

Short-selling has long been viewed with suspicion, if not outright hostility. England banned short sales for a good part of the 18th century. Napoleon called short-sellers enemies of the state. In the U.S., short-selling was widely viewed as contributing to the market crash of 1929, and in 2008, short-sellers were blamed for the collapse of the investment banks Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.

The rationale for this hostility is that short sales put downward pressure on share prices that in some cases may be unwarranted: Stories abound of investors who first put on a short sale and then spread negative rumors about the firm to drive down its price. More often, however, shorting is a legitimate bet that a share price is too high and is due to fall.

Hostility to short-selling may stem from confusion between bad news and the bearer of that news. Short-selling allows investors whose analysis indicates a firm is overpriced to take action on that belief—and to profit if they are correct. Rather than causing the stock price to fall, shorts may be anticipating a decline in the stock price. Their sales simply force the market to reflect the deteriorating prospects of troubled firms sooner than it might have otherwise. In other words, short-selling is part of the process by which the full range of information and opinion—pessimistic as well as optimistic—is brought to bear on stock prices.


For example, short-sellers took large (negative) positions in firms such as WorldCom, Enron, and Tyco even before these firms were exposed by regulators. In fact, one might argue that these emerging short positions helped regulators identify the previously undetected scandals. And in the end, Lehman and Bear Stearns were brought down by their very real losses on their mortgage-related investments—not by unfounded rumors.

Academic research supports the conjecture that short sales contribute to efficient "price discovery." For example, the greater the demand for shorting a stock, the lower its future returns tend to be; moreover, firms that attack short-sellers with threats of legal action or bad publicity tend to have especially poor future returns.* Short-sale bans may, in the end, be nothing more than an understandable, but nevertheless misguided, impulse to "shoot the messenger."

*See, for example, C. Jones and O. A. Lamont, "Short Sale Constraints and Stock Returns," Journal of Financial Economics, November 2002, pp. 207-39; or O. A. Lamont, "Go Down Fighting: Short Sellers vs. Firms," Review of Asset Pricing Studies, 2012, pp. 1-30.

# 3.10 Regulation of Securities Markets

Trading in securities markets in the United States is regulated by a myriad of laws. The major governing legislation includes the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The 1933 act requires full disclosure of relevant information relating to the issue of securities. This is the act that requires registration of new securities and issuance of a prospectus that details the financial prospects of the firm. SEC approval of a prospectus or financial report is not an endorsement of the security as a good investment. The SEC cares only that the relevant facts are disclosed; investors must make their own evaluation of the security's value.

The 1934 act established the Securities and Exchange Commission to administer the provisions of the 1933 act. It also extended the disclosure principle of the 1933 act by requiring periodic disclosure of relevant financial information by firms with already-issued securities on secondary exchanges.


The 1934 act also empowers the SEC to register and regulate securities exchanges, OTC trading, brokers, and dealers. While the SEC is the administrative agency responsible for broad oversight of the securities markets, it shares responsibility with other regulatory agencies. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates trading in futures markets, while the Federal Reserve has broad responsibility for the health of the U.S. financial system. In this role, the Fed sets margin requirements on stocks and stock options and regulates bank lending to security market participants.

The Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 established the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) to protect investors from losses if their brokerage firms fail. Just as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provides depositors with federal protection against bank failure, the SIPC ensures that investors will receive securities held for their account in street name by a failed brokerage firm up to a limit of 500,000 per customer. The SIPC is financed by levying an "insurance premium" on its participating, or member, brokerage firms.

Security trading also is subject to state laws, known generally as blue sky laws because they are intended to give investors a clearer view of investment prospects. Varying state laws were somewhat unified when many states adopted portions of the Uniform Securities Act, which was enacted in 1956.

The 2008 financial crisis also led to regulatory changes, some of which we detailed in Chapter 1. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to monitor the stability of the U.S. financial system. It is largely concerned with risks arising from potential failures of large, interconnected banks, but its voting members are the chairpersons of the main U.S. regulatory agencies, and therefore the FSOC serves a broader role to connect and coordinate key financial regulators.

# Self-Regulation

In addition to government regulation, the securities market exercises considerable self-regulation. The most important overseer in this regard is the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which is the largest nongovernmental regulator of all securities firms in the United States. FINRA was formed in 2007 through the consolidation of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) with the self-regulatory arm of the New York Stock Exchange. It describes its broad mission as the fostering of investor protection and market integrity. It examines securities firms, writes and enforces rules concerning trading practices, and administers a dispute-resolution forum for investors and registered firms.

The community of investment professionals provides another layer of self-regulation. For example, the CFA Institute has developed standards of professional conduct that govern the behavior of members with the Chartered Financial Analysts designation, commonly referred to as CFAs. The nearby box presents a brief outline of those principles.

# The Sarbanes-Oxley Act

public, and, probably most important, misleading financial statements and accounting practices. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, often called SOX, was passed by Congress in 2002 in response to these problems. Among its key provisions are

- It created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to oversee the auditing of public companies.
- It established rules requiring independent financial experts to serve on audit committees of a firm's board of directors.
- CEOs and CFOs must now personally certify that their firms' financial reports "fairly represent, in all material respects, the operations and financial condition of the company," and are subject to personal penalties if those reports turn out to be misleading. Following the letter of the rules may still be necessary, but it is no longer sufficient accounting practice.
Auditors may no longer provide several other services to their clients. This is intended to prevent potential profits on consulting work from influencing the quality of their audit.
- The Board of Directors must be composed of independent directors and hold regular meetings of directors in which company management is not present (and therefore cannot impede or influence the discussion).

More recently, there has been a fair amount of pushback on Sarbanes-Oxley. Many observers believe that the compliance costs associated with the law are too onerous, especially for smaller firms, and that heavy-handed regulatory oversight has given foreign locales an undue advantage over the United States when firms decide where to list their securities. As we saw earlier, the 2012 JOBS Act relieved many smaller firms of some of their obligations under SOX. Moreover, the efficacy of single-country regulation is being tested in the face of increasing globalization and the ease with which funds can move across national borders.

# Insider Trading

Regulations also prohibit insider trading. It is illegal for anyone to transact in securities and thus profit from inside information, that is, private information held by officers, directors, or major stockholders that has not yet been divulged to the public. But the definition of insiders can be ambiguous. While it is obvious that the chief financial officer of a firm is an insider, it is less clear whether the firm's biggest supplier can be considered an insider. Yet a supplier may deduce the firm's near-term prospects from significant changes in orders. This gives the supplier a unique form of private information, yet the supplier is not technically an insider. These ambiguities plague security analysts, whose job is to uncover as much information as possible concerning the firm's expected prospects. The dividing line between legal private information and illegal inside information can be fuzzy.

The SEC requires officers, directors, and major stockholders to report all transactions in their firm's stock. The SEC then puts out a compendium of insider trades. The idea is to inform the public of any implicit vote of confidence or no confidence made by insiders.

Insiders do exploit their knowledge. Three forms of evidence support this conclusion. First, there have been well-publicized convictions of principals in insider trading schemes.

Second, there is considerable evidence of "leakage" of useful information to some traders before any public announcement of that information. For example, share prices of firms announcing dividend increases (which the market interprets as good news concerning the firm's prospects) commonly increase in value a few days before the public announcement of the increase. Clearly, some investors are acting on the good news before it is released to the public. However, share prices still rise substantially on the day of the public release of good news, indicating that insiders, or their associates, have not fully bid up the price of the stock to the level commensurate with the news.

A third form of evidence on insider trading has to do with returns earned on trades by insiders. Researchers have examined the SEC's summary of insider trading to measure the performance of insiders. In one of the best known of these studies, Jaffee examined the abnormal return of stocks over the months following purchases or sales by insiders. For months in which insider purchasers of a stock exceeded insider sellers of the stock by three or more, the stock had an abnormal return in the following eight months of about  $5\%$ . Moreover, when insider sellers exceeded insider buyers, the stock tended to perform poorly.

1. Firms issue securities to raise the capital necessary to finance their investments. Investment bankers market these securities to the public on the primary market. Investment bankers generally act as underwriters who purchase the securities from the firm and resell them to the public at a markup. Before the securities may be sold to the public, the firm must publish an SEC-approved prospectus that provides information on the firm's prospects.
2. Already-issued securities are traded on the secondary market, that is, on organized stock markets; on the over-the-counter market; and occasionally, for very large trades, through direct negotiation. Brokerage firms with access to exchanges sell their services to individuals, charging commissions for executing trades on their behalf.
3. Trading may take place in dealer markets, via electronic communication networks, or in specialist/ designated market maker markets. In dealer markets, security dealers post bid and ask prices at which they are willing to trade. Brokers execute trades for their clients at the best available prices. In electronic markets, the existing book of limit orders provides the terms at which trades can be executed. Mutually agreeable offers to buy or sell securities are automatically crossed by the computer system operating the market.
4. NASDAQ was traditionally a dealer market in which a network of dealers negotiated directly over sales of securities. The NYSE was traditionally a specialist market. Today, however, trading in both markets is overwhelmingly electronic.
5. Buying on margin means borrowing money from a broker to buy more securities than can be purchased with one's own money alone. By buying securities on margin, an investor magnifies both the upside potential and the downside risk. If the equity in a margin account falls below the required maintenance level, the investor will get a margin call from the broker.
6. Short-selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own. The short-seller borrows the securities from a broker, sells them, and may be required to cover the short position at any time on demand. The cash proceeds of a short sale are kept in escrow by the broker, and the broker usually requires that the short-seller deposit additional cash or securities to serve as margin (collateral).
7. Securities trading is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, by other government agencies, and through self-regulation of the exchanges. Many of the important regulations have to do with full disclosure of relevant information concerning the securities in question. Insider trading rules also prohibit traders from attempting to profit from inside information.

$b$ . Paintings trade in broker markets when clients commission brokers to buy or sell art for them, in dealer markets at art galleries, and in auction markets.
c. Rare coins trade in dealer markets in coin shops, but they also trade in auctions and in direct search markets when individuals advertise they want to buy or sell coins.
3. a. You should give your broker a market order. It will be executed immediately and is the cheapest type of order in terms of brokerage fees.
b. You should give your broker a limit-buy order, which will be executed only if the shares can be obtained at a price about  $5\%$  below the current price.
c. You should give your broker a limit-sell order, which will be executed if the share price rises above the level at which you are convinced that the firm is overvalued.

# Mutual Funds and Other Investment Companies

# 4

THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER introduced you to the mechanics of trading securities and the structure of the markets in which they trade. Commonly, however, individual investors do not trade securities directly for their own accounts. Instead, they direct their funds to investment companies that purchase securities on their behalf. The most important of these financial intermediaries are mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, to which we devote most of this chapter. We also touch briefly on other types of investment companies.

We begin the chapter by describing and comparing the various types of investment companies available to investors—unit investment trusts, closed-end funds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds. We devote most of our attention to mutual and exchange-traded funds, examining their functions, their investment styles and policies, and the costs of investing in them.


Next we take a first look at the investment performance of these funds. We consider the impact of expenses and turnover on net performance. Finally, we discuss sources of information on mutual funds, and we consider in detail the information provided in Morningstar's mutual fund reports.

# 4.1 Investment Companies

Investment companies are financial intermediaries that collect funds from individual investors and invest those funds in a potentially wide range of securities or other assets. Pooling of assets is the key idea behind investment companies. Each investor has a claim to the portfolio established by the investment company in proportion to the amount invested. These companies thus provide a mechanism for small investors to "team up" to obtain the benefits of large-scale investing.

Investment companies perform several important functions for their investors:

1. Record keeping and administration. Investment companies issue periodic status reports, keeping track of capital gains distributions, dividends, investments, and redemptions, and they may reinvest dividend and interest income for shareholders.
2. Diversification and divisibility. By pooling their money, investment companies enable investors to hold fractional shares of many different securities. The companies can act as large investors even if any individual shareholder cannot.
3. Professional management. Investment companies can support full-time staffs of security analysts and portfolio managers who attempt to achieve superior investment results for their investors.
4. Lower transaction costs. Because they trade large blocks of securities, investment companies can achieve substantial savings on trading costs.

While investment companies pool assets of individual investors, they also need to divide claims to those assets among those investors. Investors buy shares in investment companies, and ownership is proportional to the number of shares purchased. The value of each share is called the net asset value (NAV). Net asset value equals assets minus liabilities expressed on a per-share basis:

$$
\text {N e t a s s e t v a l u e} = \frac {\text {M a r k e t v a l u e o f a s s e t s - L i a b i l i t i e s}}{\text {S h a r e s o u t s t a n d i n g}}
$$

# Example 4.1 Net Asset Value

Consider a mutual fund that manages a portfolio of securities worth  \$120 million. Suppose the fund owes\$ 4 million to its investment advisers and another 1 million for rent, wages due, and miscellaneous expenses. The fund has 5 million shares outstanding.

$$
\text {N e t a s s e t v a l u e} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 2 0 \text {m i l l o n - S 5 m i l l o n}}{5 \text {m i l l o n s h a r e s}} = \mathbb {S} 2 3 \text {p e r s h a r e}
$$

Assets: 4,034.4

Liabilities: 81.8

Shares: 101.1

# 4.2 Types of Investment Companies

In the United States, investment companies are classified by the Investment Company Act of 1940 as either unit investment trusts or managed investment companies. The portfolios of unit investment trusts are essentially fixed and thus are called "unmanaged." In contrast, managed companies are so named because securities in their investment portfolios are continually bought and sold: The portfolios are managed. Managed companies are further classified as either closed-end or open-end. Open-end companies are what we commonly call mutual funds.


# Unit Investment Trusts

Unit investment trusts are pools of money invested in a portfolio that is fixed for the life of the fund. To form a unit investment trust, a sponsor, typically a brokerage firm, buys a portfolio of securities that are deposited into a trust. It then sells shares, or "units," in the trust, called redeemable trust certificates. All income and payments of principal from the portfolio are paid out by the fund's trustees (a bank or trust company) to the shareholders.

There is little active management of a unit investment trust because once established, the portfolio composition is fixed; hence, these trusts are referred to as unmanaged. Trusts tend to invest in relatively uniform types of assets; for example, one trust may invest in municipal bonds, another in corporate bonds. The uniformity of the portfolio is consistent with the lack of active management. The trusts provide investors a vehicle to purchase a pool of one particular type of asset that can be included in an overall portfolio as desired.

Sponsors of unit investment trusts earn their profit by selling shares in the trust at a premium to the cost of acquiring the underlying assets. For example, a trust that has purchased  \$5 million of assets may sell 5,000 shares to the public at a price of\$ 1,030 per share, which (assuming the trust has no liabilities) represents a  $3\%$  premium over the net asset value of the securities held by the trust. The  $3\%$  premium is the trustee's fee for establishing the trust.

Investors who wish to liquidate their holdings of a unit investment trust may sell the shares back to the trustee for net asset value. The trustees can either sell enough securities from the asset portfolio to obtain the cash necessary to pay the investor, or they may instead sell the shares to a new investor (again at a slight premium to net asset value). Unit investment trusts have steadily lost market share to mutual funds in recent years. While mutual fund assets have soared, assets in such trusts declined from  \$105 billion in 1990 to only\$ 78 billion in 2021.

# Managed Investment Companies

There are two types of managed companies: closed-end and open-end. In both cases, the fund's board of directors, which is elected by shareholders, hires a management company to manage the portfolio for an annual fee that typically ranges from  $.2\%$  to  $1.25\%$  of assets. In many cases the management company is the firm that organized the fund. For example, Fidelity Management and Research Corporation sponsors many Fidelity mutual funds and is responsible for managing the portfolios. It assesses a management fee on each Fidelity fund. In other cases, a mutual fund will hire an outside portfolio manager. For example, Vanguard has hired Wellington Management as the investment adviser for its Wellington Fund. Most management companies have contracts to manage several funds.

Open-end funds stand ready to redeem or issue shares at their net asset value (although both purchases and redemptions may involve sales charges). When investors in open-end funds wish to "cash out" their shares, they sell them back to the fund at NAV. In contrast, closed-end funds do not redeem or issue shares. Investors who wish to cash out must sell their shares to other investors. Shares of closed-end funds are traded on organized exchanges and can be purchased through brokers just like other

In 2021, about 280 billion of assets were held in closed-end funds.

Figure 4.1 Closed-end mutual funds

Source: CEF Connect, www.cefconnect.com, July 20, 2021.


Figure 4.1 lists a few closed-end funds. The first column gives the name and ticker symbol of the fund. The next two columns give the fund's most recent price and net asset value. The premium or discount in the next column is the percentage difference between price and NAV: (Price - NAV)/NAV. Discounts to NAV (indicated by negative differences) are more common than premiums. Finally, the 52-week return based on the change in NAV plus dividends is presented in the last column.

The common divergence of price from net asset value, often by wide margins, is a puzzle that has yet to be fully explained. To see why this is a puzzle, consider a closed-end fund selling for less than net asset value. By selling all the assets in the portfolio, the fund would realize proceeds equal to net asset value, thus immediately increasing the wealth of its investors. Despite this apparent profit opportunity, sizable discounts seem to persist for long periods of time.


Moreover, fund premiums or discounts tend to dissipate over time, so funds selling at a discount receive a boost to their rate of return as the discount shrinks. Pontiff estimates that a fund selling at a  $20\%$  discount would have an expected 12-month return more than  $6\%$  greater than funds selling at net asset value.

Interestingly, while many closed-end funds sell at a discount from net asset value, the prices of these funds when originally issued are often above NAV. This is a further puzzle, as it is hard to explain why investors would purchase these newly issued funds at a premium to NAV when the shares tend to fall to a discount shortly after issue.

In contrast to closed-end funds, the price of open-end funds will never fall below NAV because these funds stand ready to redeem shares at NAV. The offering price will exceed NAV, however, if the fund carries a load, which is, in effect, a sales charge. Load funds are sold by securities brokers and directly by mutual fund groups.

Unlike closed-end funds, open-end mutual funds do not trade on organized exchanges. Instead, investors simply buy shares from and liquidate through the investment company at net asset value. Thus, the number of outstanding shares of these funds changes daily. In 2021, about 280 billion of assets were held in closed-end funds.

# Exchange-Traded Funds

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are similar in several respects to open-end mutual funds. Like mutual funds, most ETFs are classified and regulated as investment companies. Also like mutual funds, they offer investors a prorated ownership share of a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets and report net asset value each day.

However, in contrast to mutual funds, where investors buy and redeem shares directly with the sponsoring company, investors buy and sell ETF shares through a broker just as they would shares of stock. These transactions occur continuously throughout the day, rather than (as is the case for mutual funds) once a day at the NAV computed at market close.

ETFs were first issued in the United States in 1993 and until about 2008, offered exclusively portfolios designed to track various market indexes. While indexed ETFs still dominate the market, they have since been joined by hundreds of actively managed funds. The ETF market has experienced tremendous growth: By early 2022, ETFs with over 5.4 trillion in assets under management traded in the United States. We discuss these securities in more detail later in the chapter.

Some intermediaries are not formally organized or regulated as investment companies but nevertheless serve similar functions. Three of the more important are commingled funds, real estate investment trusts, and hedge funds.

Commingled Funds Commingled funds are partnerships of investors that pool funds. The management firm that organizes the partnership, for example, a bank or insurance company, manages the funds for a fee. Typical partners in a commingled fund might be trust or retirement accounts with portfolios much larger than those of most individual investors, but still too small to warrant managing on a separate basis.

Commingled funds are similar in form to open-end mutual funds. Instead of shares, though, the fund offers units, which are bought and sold at net asset value. A bank or insurance company may offer an array of different commingled funds, for example, a money market fund, a bond fund, and a common stock fund.

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) A REIT is similar to a closed-end fund. REITs invest in real estate or loans secured by real estate. Besides issuing shares, they raise capital by borrowing from banks and issuing bonds or mortgages. Most of them are highly leveraged, with a typical debt ratio of  $70\%$ .

There are two principal kinds of REITs. Equity trusts invest in real estate directly, whereas mortgage trusts invest primarily in mortgage and construction loans. REITs generally are established by banks, insurance companies, or mortgage companies, which then serve as investment managers to earn a fee.

Hedge Funds Like mutual funds, hedge funds are vehicles that allow private investors to pool assets to be invested by a fund manager. Unlike mutual funds, however, hedge funds are commonly structured as private partnerships and thus subject to only minimal SEC regulation. They typically are open only to wealthy or institutional investors. Many require investors to agree to initial "lock-ups," that is, periods as long as several years in which investments cannot be withdrawn. Lock-ups allow hedge funds to invest in illiquid assets without worrying about meeting demands for redemption of funds. Moreover, because hedge funds are only lightly regulated, their managers can pursue investment strategies involving, for example, heavy use of derivatives, short sales, and leverage; such strategies typically are not open to mutual fund managers.

Hedge funds by design are empowered to invest in a wide range of investments, with various funds focusing on derivatives, distressed firms, currency speculation, convertible bonds, emerging markets, merger arbitrage, and so on. Other funds may jump from one asset class to another as perceived investment opportunities shift.

Hedge funds enjoyed great growth in the last few decades, with assets under management ballooning from about  \$50 billion in 1990 to about\$ 4 trillion in 2021. We devote a good part of Chapter 26 to these funds.

# 4.3 Mutual Funds

Mutual funds are the common name for open-end investment companies. This is the dominant investment company today, accounting for about  $80\%$  of investment company assets. Assets under management in the U.S. mutual fund industry were approximately  $\$23.9$  trillion in early 2021, with nearly another  $\$40$  trillion managed by non-U.S. mutual and exchange-traded funds.

# Investment Policies

Each mutual fund has a specified investment policy, which is described in the fund's prospectus. For example, money market mutual funds hold the short-term, low-risk instruments of the money market (see Chapter 2 for a review of these securities), while bond funds hold fixed-income securities. Some funds have even more narrowly defined mandates. For example, some bond funds will hold primarily Treasury bonds, others primarily mortgage-backed securities.

Management companies manage a family, or "complex," of mutual funds. They organize an entire collection of funds and collect a management fee for operating them. By managing a collection of funds under one umbrella, these companies make it easy for investors to allocate assets across market sectors and to switch assets across funds while still benefiting from centralized record keeping. Some of the most well-known management companies are Fidelity, Vanguard, and BlackRock. Each offers an array of open-end mutual funds with different investment policies. In 2021, there were nearly 8,000 mutual funds in the U.S., which were offered by more than 800 fund complexes.

Funds are commonly classified by investment policy into one of the following groups: money market funds, equity funds, sector funds, bond funds, international funds, balanced funds, asset allocation and flexible funds, and index funds.

Money Market Funds These funds invest in money market securities such as Treasury bills, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, or certificates of deposit. The average maturity of these assets tends to be a bit more than 1 month. Money market funds usually offer check-writing features and net asset value is fixed at 1 per share,[2] so there are no tax implications such as capital gains or losses associated with redemption of shares.

Money market funds are classified as prime versus government. As their name suggests, government funds hold short-term U.S. Treasury or agency securities and repurchase agreements collateralized by such securities. Prime funds also hold other money market instruments such as commercial paper or bank CDs. While these assets are certainly at the very safe end of the credit-risk spectrum, they are nevertheless riskier than government securities and are more prone to suffer reduced liquidity in times of market stress. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, prime funds are now subject to "gates" that allow funds to temporarily halt redemptions during periods of severe disruption.

Moreover, while both prime and government retail money market funds maintain net asset value at 1.00 per share, prime institutional funds now must calculate and report net asset value. While capital gains or losses will normally be very small, this "floating" of NAV has contributed to a shift in investor demand from prime to government funds.

Equity Funds Equity funds invest primarily in stock, although they may, at the portfolio manager's discretion, also hold fixed-income or other types of securities. Equity funds commonly hold a small fraction of total assets in money market securities to provide the liquidity necessary to meet potential redemption of shares.

Stock funds are traditionally classified by their emphasis on capital appreciation versus current income. Thus, income funds tend to hold shares of firms with consistently high dividend yields. Growth funds are willing to forgo current income, focusing instead on prospects for capital gains. While the classification of these funds is couched in terms of income versus capital gains, in practice, the more relevant distinction concerns the level of risk these funds assume. Growth stocks, and therefore growth funds, are typically riskier and respond more dramatically to changes in economic conditions than do income funds.

Sector Funds Some equity funds, called sector funds, concentrate on a particular industry. For example, Fidelity markets dozens of "select funds," each of which invests in a specific industry such as biotechnology, utilities, energy, or telecommunications. Other funds specialize in securities of particular countries.

Bond Funds As the name suggests, these funds specialize in the fixed-income sector. Within that sector, however, there is considerable room for further specialization. For example, various funds will concentrate on corporate bonds, Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities, or municipal (tax-free) bonds. Indeed, some municipal bond funds invest only in bonds of a particular state to satisfy the investment desires of residents of that state who wish to avoid local as well as federal taxes on interest income. Many funds also specialize by maturity, ranging from short-term to intermediate to long-term, or by the credit risk of the issuer, ranging from very safe to high-yield, or "junk," bonds.

International Funds Many funds have an international focus. Global funds invest in securities worldwide, including the United States. In contrast, international funds invest in securities of firms located outside the United States. Regional funds concentrate on a particular part of the world, and emerging market funds invest in companies of developing nations.

Balanced Funds Some funds are designed to be candidates for an individual's entire investment portfolio. These balanced funds hold both equities and fixed-income securities in relatively stable proportions. Life-cycle funds are balanced funds in which the asset mix can range from aggressive (primarily marketed to younger investors) to conservative (directed at older investors). Static allocation life-cycle funds maintain a stable mix across stocks and bonds, while target-date funds gradually become more conservative as time passes and the date of a particular milestone such as retirement draws nearer.

Many balanced funds are in fact funds of funds. These are mutual funds that primarily invest in shares of other mutual funds. Balanced funds of funds invest in equity and bond funds in proportions suited to their investment goals.

Asset Allocation and Flexible Funds These funds are similar to balanced funds in that they hold both stocks and bonds. However, asset allocation funds may dramatically vary the proportions allocated to each market in accord with the portfolio manager's forecast of the relative performance of each sector. Hence, these funds are engaged in market timing and are not designed to be low-risk investment vehicles.

Index Funds An index fund tries to match the performance of a broad market index. The fund buys shares in securities included in a particular index in proportion to each security's representation in that index. For example, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund is a mutual fund that replicates the composition of the Standard & Poor's 500 stock price index. Because the S&P 500 is a value-weighted index, the fund buys shares in each S&P 500 company in proportion to the market value of that company's outstanding equity. Investment in an index fund is a low-cost way for small investors to pursue a passive investment strategy—that is, to invest without engaging in security analysis. About  $40\%$  of the assets in mutual and exchange-traded funds in 2021 were indexed. While the majority of these were in equity funds, index funds can be tied to nonequity indexes as well. For example, Vanguard offers a bond index fund and a real estate index fund.


Table 4.1 breaks down the number of mutual funds by investment orientation. Sometimes a fund name describes its investment policy. For example, Vanguard's GNMA fund invests in mortgage-backed securities, the Municipal Intermediate fund invests in intermediate-term municipal bonds, and the High-Yield Corporate bond fund invests in large part in speculative grade, or "junk," bonds with high yields. However, names of common stock funds often reflect little or nothing about their investment policies. Examples are Vanguard's Windsor and Wellington funds.

# How Funds Are Sold

Mutual funds are generally marketed to the public either directly by the fund underwriter or indirectly through brokers acting on behalf of the underwriter. Direct-marketed funds are sold through the mail, various offices of the fund, over the phone, or, more so, over the Internet. Investors contact the fund directly to purchase shares.

About half of fund sales today are distributed through a sales force. Brokers or financial advisers receive a commission for selling shares to investors. (Ultimately, the commission is paid by the investor. More on this shortly.) Investors who rely on their broker's advice to select their mutual funds should be aware that this advice may suffer from a conflict of interest if the broker receives compensation for directing the sale to a particular fund.

Many funds also are sold through "financial supermarkets" that sell shares in funds of many complexes. Instead of charging customers a sales commission, the broker splits management fees with the mutual fund company. Another advantage is unified record keeping for all funds purchased from the supermarket, even if the funds are offered by different complexes. On the other hand, many contend that these supermarkets result in higher expense ratios because mutual funds pass along the costs of participating in these programs in the form of higher management fees.

# 4.4 Costs of Investing in Mutual Funds

# Fee Structure

An individual investor choosing a mutual fund should consider not only the fund's stated investment policy and past performance but also its management fees and other expenses. Comparative data on virtually all important aspects of mutual funds are available on Morningstar's Web site at www.morningstar.com. You should be aware of four general classes of fees.

Operating Expenses Operating expenses are the costs incurred by the mutual fund in operating the portfolio, including administrative expenses and advisory fees paid to the investment manager. These expenses, usually expressed as a percentage of total assets under management, may range from  $.2\%$  to  $1.5\%$  annually. Shareholders do not receive an explicit bill for these operating expenses; instead, the expenses periodically are deducted from the assets of the fund. Shareholders pay for these expenses through the reduced value of the portfolio.

The simple average of the expense ratio of all equity funds in the U.S. was  $1.16\%$  in 2020. But larger funds tend to have lower expense ratios, so the average expense ratio weighted by assets under management is considerably smaller, .50\%. (These expense ratios all include 12b-1 fees, if any, which are discussed shortly.) Not surprisingly, the average expense ratio of actively managed funds is considerably higher than that of indexed funds, .71\% versus .06\% (weighted by assets under management).

In addition to operating expenses, many funds assess fees to pay for marketing and distribution costs. These charges are used primarily to pay the brokers or financial advisers who sell the funds to the public. One can avoid these expenses by buying shares directly from the fund sponsor, but many investors are willing to incur these distribution fees in return for the advice they may receive from their broker.

Front-End Load A front-end load is a commission or sales charge paid when you purchase the shares. These charges, which are used primarily to pay the brokers who sell the funds, may not exceed 8.5\%, but in practice they are rarely higher than 6\%. Low-load funds have loads that range up to 3\% of invested funds. No-load funds have no front-end sales charges. Loads effectively reduce the amount of money invested. For example, each 1,000 paid for a fund with a 6\% load incurs a sales charge of \$ 60 and fund investment of only \$ 940. You need cumulative returns of 6.4\% of your net investment (60/940 = .064) just to break even.

Back-End Load A back-end load is a redemption, or "exit," fee incurred when you sell your shares. Typically, funds that impose back-end loads reduce them by 1 percentage point for every year the funds are left invested. Thus, an exit fee that starts at  $4\%$  would fall to  $2\%$  by the start of your third year. These charges are known more formally as "contingent deferred sales loads."

12b-1 Charges The Securities and Exchange Commission allows the managers of so-called 12b-1 funds to use fund assets to pay for distribution costs such as advertising, promotional literature including annual reports and prospectuses, and, most important, commissions paid to brokers who sell the fund to investors. These 12b-1 fees are named after the SEC rule that permits use of these plans. Funds may use 12b-1 charges instead of, or in addition to, front-end loads to generate the fees with which to pay brokers. As with operating expenses, investors are not explicitly billed for 12b-1 charges. Instead, the fees are deducted from the assets of the fund. Therefore, 12b-1 fees (if any) must be added to operating expenses to obtain the true annual expense ratio of the fund. The SEC requires that all funds include in the prospectus a consolidated expense table that summarizes all relevant fees. The 12b-1 fees are limited to  $1\%$  of a fund's average net assets per year. $^3$

Many funds offer "classes" that represent ownership in the same portfolio of securities, but with different combinations of fees. Typically, Class A shares have front-end loads and a small 12b-1 fee, often around  $25\%$ . Class C shares rely more on 12b-1 fees, commonly  $1\%$ , and often charge a modest back-end load. Class I shares are sold to institutional investors. These are sometimes called class Y shares and carry no loads or 12b-1 fees.

# Example 4.2 Fees for Various Classes

The table below lists fees for different classes of the BNY Mellon (formerly Dreyfus) High Yield Fund in 2021. Notice the trade-off between the front-end loads versus 12b-1 charges in the choice between Class A and Class C shares. Class I shares are sold only to institutional investors and carry lower fees.

Starts at  $4.5\%$  for investments less than \$50,000 and tapers to zero for investments more than \$ 1 million.


bDepending on years until holdings are sold. Exit fee is  $1 \%$  for shares redeemed within one year of purchase.

cIncluding annual service fee.

The maximum 12b-1 charge for the sale of the fund is .75\%. However, an additional service fee of .25\% of the fund's assets also is allowed for personal service and/or maintenance of shareholder accounts.

4Many funds used to market Class B shares as well. These shares had higher expense ratios, particularly higher back-end loads. However, if an investor held Class B shares for a long enough duration, typically 6-8 years, the shares would convert into Class A shares. Class B shares have become increasingly less common in recent years.

Each investor must choose the best combination of fees. Obviously, pure no-load no-fee funds distributed directly by the mutual fund group are the cheapest alternative, and these will often make most sense for knowledgeable investors. However, as we have noted, many investors are willing to pay for financial advice, and the commissions paid to advisers who sell these funds are the most common form of payment. Alternatively, investors may choose to hire a fee-only financial manager who charges directly for services instead of collecting commissions. These advisers can help investors select portfolios of low- or no-load funds (as well as provide other financial advice). Independent financial planners have become increasingly important distribution channels for funds in recent years.

If you do buy a fund through a broker, the choice between paying a load and paying 12b-1 fees will depend primarily on your expected time horizon. Loads are paid only once for each purchase, whereas 12b-1 fees are paid annually. Thus, if you plan to hold your fund for a long time, a one-time load may be preferable to recurring 12b-1 charges.

# Fees and Mutual Fund Returns

The rate of return on a mutual fund investment is the increase or decrease in net asset value plus income distributions such as dividends or distributions of capital gains, all expressed as a fraction of net asset value at the beginning of the investment period. If we denote the net asset value at the start and end of the period as  $\mathrm{NAV}_0$  and  $\mathrm{NAV}_1$ , respectively, then

$$
\text {R a t e} = \frac {\mathrm {N A V} _ {1} - \mathrm {N A V} _ {0} + \text {I n c o m e a n d c a p i t a l g a i n d i s t r i b u t i o n s}}{\mathrm {N A V} _ {0}}
$$

For example, if a fund has an initial NAV of  \$20 at the start of the month, makes income distributions of$ .15 and capital gain distributions of $.05, and ends the month with NAV of \$20.10, the monthly rate of return is

$$
\text{Rate of return} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 20.10 - \mathbb {S} 20.00 + \mathbb {S}. 15 + \mathbb {S}. 05}{\mathbb {S} 20.00} = . 015, \text {or} 1.5 \%
$$

Notice that this measure of the rate of return ignores any commissions such as front-end loads paid to purchase the fund.

On the other hand, the rate of return is affected by the fund's expenses and 12b-1 fees. This is because such charges are periodically deducted from the portfolio, which reduces net asset value. Thus, the investor's rate of return equals the gross return on the underlying portfolio minus the total expense ratio.

# Example 4.3 Fees and Net Returns

To see how expenses can affect rate of return, consider a fund with \$100 million in assets at the start of the year and with 10 million shares outstanding. The fund invests in a portfolio of stocks that provides no income but increases in value by  $10\%$ . The expense ratio, including 12b-1 fees, is  $1\%$ . What is the rate of return for an investor in the fund?

The initial NAV equals \$100 million/10 million shares = \$10 per share. In the absence of expenses, fund assets would grow to \$110 million and NAV would grow to \$11 per share, for a 10\% rate of return. However, the expense ratio of the fund is 1\%. Therefore, \$1 million will be deducted from the fund to pay these fees, leaving the portfolio worth only \$109 million and NAV equal to 10.90. The rate of return on the fund is only 9\%, which equals the gross return on the underlying portfolio minus the total expense ratio.

*After front-end load, if any.

Notes:

1. Fund A is no-load with .25\% expense ratio.
2. Fund B is no-load with  $1.25\%$  expense ratio.
3. Fund C has a  $6\%$  load on purchases and a  $8\%$  expense ratio.
4. Gross return on all funds is  $10\%$  per year before expenses.

Fees can have a big effect on performance. Table 4.2 considers an investor who starts with 10,000 and can choose among three funds that all earn an annual 10\% return on investment before fees but have different fee structures. The table shows the cumulative amount in each fund after several investment horizons. Fund A has total operating expenses of .25\%, no load, and no 12b-1 charges. This might represent a low-cost producer like Vanguard. Fund B has no load but has .75\% in management expenses and .5\% in 12b-1 fees. This level of charges is fairly typical of actively managed equity funds. Finally, Fund C has .80\% in management expenses, has no 12b-1 charges, but assesses a 6\% front-end load on purchases.

Note the substantial return advantage of low-cost Fund A. Moreover, that differential is greater for longer investment horizons.

# Concept Check 4.2

The Equity Fund sells Class A shares with a front-end load of  $4 \%$ and Class C shares with 12b- 1 fees of .5\% annually as well as back- end load fees that start at  $5 \%$ and fall by  $1 \%$ for each full year the investor holds the portfolio (until the fifth year). Assume the rate of return on the fund portfolio net of operating expenses is  $10 \%$ annually. What will be the value of a 10,000 investment in Class A and Class C shares if the shares are sold after (a) 1 year, (b) 4 years, and (c) 10 years? Which fee structure provides higher net proceeds at the end of each investment horizon?

Although expenses can have a big impact on net investment performance, it is sometimes difficult for the investor in a mutual fund to measure true expenses accurately. This is because of the practice of paying for some expenses in soft dollars. A portfolio manager earns soft-dollar credits with a brokerage firm by directing the fund's trades to that broker. On the basis of those credits, the broker will pay for some of the mutual fund's expenses, such as databases, computer hardware, or stock-Quotation systems. The soft-dollar arrangement means that the stockbroker effectively returns part of the trading commission to the fund. Purchases made with soft dollars are not included in the fund's expenses, so funds with extensive soft-dollar arrangements may report artificially low expense ratios to the public. However, the fund may have paid its broker needlessly high commissions to obtain its soft-dollar "rebate." The impact of the higher trading commission shows up in net investment performance rather than the reported expense ratio.

# 4.5 Taxation of Mutual Fund Income

Investment returns of mutual funds are granted "pass-through status" under the U.S. tax code, meaning that taxes are paid only by the investor in the mutual fund, not by the fund itself. The income is treated as passed through to the investor as long as the fund meets several requirements, most notably that virtually all income is distributed to shareholders. A fund's short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains, and dividends are passed through to investors as though the investor earned the income directly.

The pass-through of investment income has one important disadvantage for individual investors. If you manage your own portfolio, you decide when to realize capital gains and losses on any security; therefore, you can time those realizations to efficiently manage your tax liabilities. When you invest through a mutual fund, however, the timing of security sales is out of your control, which reduces your ability to engage in tax management.[5]

A fund with a high portfolio turnover rate can be particularly "tax inefficient." Turnover is the ratio of the trading activity of a portfolio to the assets of the portfolio. It measures the fraction of the portfolio that is "replaced" each year. For example, a  \$100 million portfolio with\$ 50 million in sales of some securities and purchases of other securities would have a turnover rate of 50\%. High turnover means that capital gains or losses are being realized continually, and therefore that the investor cannot time the realizations to manage his or her overall tax obligation.

Until recently, turnover rates in equity funds typically were around  $50\%$  when weighted by assets under management. By contrast, a low-turnover fund such as an index fund may have turnover as low as  $2\%$ , which is both tax-efficient and economical with respect to trading costs. However, in the last decade, asset-weighted average turnover has dropped considerably, falling to  $32\%$  in 2020. Part of this decline probably reflects the shift from actively managed to indexed funds.

SEC rules require funds to disclose the tax impact of portfolio turnover. Funds must include in their prospectus after-tax returns for the past 1-, 5-, and 10-year periods. Marketing literature that includes performance data also must include after-tax results. The after-tax returns are computed accounting for the impact of the taxable distributions of income and capital gains passed through to the investor, assuming the investor is in the maximum federal tax bracket.

# Concept Check 4.3

An investor's portfolio currently is worth  \$1 million. During the year, the investor sells 400 shares of Etsy at a price of\$ 200 per share and 1,600 shares of Cisco at a price of \$50 per share. The proceeds are used to buy 1,000 shares of Apple at \$160 per share.

a. What is the portfolio turnover rate?
b. If the shares in Etsy originally were purchased for  \$175 each and those in Cisco were purchased for\$ 40, and the investor's tax rate on capital gains income is 20\%, how much extra will the investor owe on this year's taxes as a result of these transactions?

# 4.6 Exchange-Traded Funds

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), first introduced in 1993, are offshoots of mutual funds that allow investors to trade entire portfolios just as they do shares of stock. The first ETF was the "spider," a nickname for SPDR, or Standard & Poor's Depository Receipt, which is a unit investment trust holding a portfolio matching the S&P 500 Index. Unlike mutual funds, which can be bought or sold only at the end of the day when NAV is calculated, investors can trade spiders throughout the day, just like any other share of stock. Spiders gave rise to many similar products such as "diamonds" (based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, ticker DIA), "cubes" (based on the NASDAQ 100 index, ticker QQQ), and "WEBS" (World Equity Benchmark Shares, which are shares in portfolios of foreign stock market indexes). By 2022, about 9.5 trillion was invested in more than 2,200 U.S. ETFs.

Figure 4.2 shows the rapid growth in the ETF market since 1998. The market leaders are Vanguard, State Street, and BlackRock, which uses the product name iShares for its funds. The firms sponsor ETFs for several dozen equity index funds, including many broad U.S. equity indexes, broad international and single-country funds, and U.S. and global industry-sector funds. They also offer several bond ETFs and a few commodity funds such as ones for gold and silver.

Until 2008, ETFs were required to track specified indexes, and ETFs tracking broad indexes still dominate the industry. Starting in 2008, the SEC granted approval for so-called actively managed ETFs with other investment objectives, for example, focusing on attributes such as value, growth, dividend yield, liquidity, recent performance, or volatility. These are often called smart beta funds because "beta" is often used as jargon for the sensitivity to one or another factor. Another term in common use is factor-based funds.

These funds are still transparent in the sense that they must disclose portfolio composition each day. In 2021, there were about 500 of these ETFs, with assets under management exceeding 170 billion.

Today, there are dozens of industry-sector ETFs, and as Figure 4.2 makes clear, a significant number of commodity, bond, and international ETFs. In addition to factor and industry-based funds, many mutual fund companies such as Fidelity now offer ETFs that mimic their popular mutual funds. Figure 4.3 shows that ETFs have captured a significant portion of the assets under management in the investment company universe.

Another recent innovation is nontransparent actively managed ETFs that, like actively managed mutual funds, attempt to outperform passive indexes. If these funds had to report portfolio holdings on a daily basis, competitors could take advantage of their buying and

In 2014, however, the SEC gave permission to Eaton Vance to offer an actively managed "nontransparent" ETF that is required to report its portfolio composition only once each quarter, the same frequency at which mutual funds disclose their portfolio holdings, and that product, called NextShares, began trading in 2016. Other companies such as BlackRock have also indicated interest in sponsoring nontransparent ETFs, but to date, these products constitute only a tiny sliver of the broad ETF market.

Other even more exotic variations are so-called synthetic ETFs such as exchange-traded notes (ETNs) or exchange-traded vehicles (ETVs). These are nominally debt securities, but with payoffs linked to the performance of an index. Often that index measures the performance of an illiquid and thinly traded asset class, so the ETF gives the investor the opportunity to add that asset class to his or her portfolio. However, rather than invest in those assets directly, the ETF achieves this exposure by entering a "total return swap" with an investment bank in which the bank agrees to pay the ETF the return on the index in exchange for a relatively fixed fee. These products are a bit controversial, as the ETF is then exposed to risk that in a period of financial stress the investment bank will be unable to fulfill its obligation, leaving investors without the returns they were promised.

ETFs offer several advantages over conventional mutual funds. First, a mutual fund's net asset value is quoted—and, therefore, investors can buy or sell their shares in the fund—only once a day. In contrast, ETFs trade continuously. Moreover, like other shares, but unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be sold short or purchased on margin.

ETFs also offer a potential tax advantage over mutual funds. When large numbers of mutual fund investors redeem their shares, the fund must sell securities to meet the redemptions. This can trigger capital gains taxes, which are passed through to and must be paid by the remaining shareholders. In contrast, when small investors wish to redeem their position in an ETF, they simply sell their shares to other traders, with no need for the fund to sell any of the underlying portfolio. Large investors can exchange their ETF shares for shares in the underlying portfolio; this form of redemption also avoids a tax event.

ETFs are also cheaper than mutual funds. Investors who buy ETFs do so through brokers rather than buying directly from the fund. Therefore, the fund saves the cost of marketing itself directly to small investors. This reduction in expenses may translate into lower management fees.

There are some disadvantages to ETFs, however. First, while mutual funds can be bought at no expense from no-load funds, the purchase of an ETF entails a broker's commission. In addition, because ETFs trade as securities, their prices can depart from NAV, at least for short periods, and these price discrepancies can easily swamp the cost advantage that ETFs otherwise offer. While those discrepancies typically are quite small, they can spike unpredictably when markets are stressed. Chapter 3 briefly discussed the so-called flash crash of May 6, 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 583 points in seven minutes, leaving it down nearly 1,000 points for the day. Remarkably, the index recovered more than 600 points in the next 10 minutes. In the wake of this incredible volatility, the stock exchanges canceled many trades that had gone off at what were viewed as distorted prices. Around one-fifth of all ETFs changed hands on that day at prices less than one-half of their closing price, and ETFs accounted for about two-thirds of all canceled trades.

At least two problems were exposed in this episode. First, when markets are not working properly, it can be hard to measure the net asset value of the ETF portfolio, especially for ETFs that track less liquid assets. And, reinforcing this problem, some ETFs may be supported by only a very small number of dealers. If they drop out of the market during a period of turmoil, prices may swing wildly.

# 4.7 Mutual Fund Investment Performance: A First Look

We noted earlier that one of the benefits of mutual funds for the individual investor is the ability to delegate management of the portfolio to investment professionals. The investor retains control over the broad features of the overall portfolio through the asset allocation decision: Each individual chooses the percentages of the portfolio to invest in bond funds versus equity funds versus money market funds, and so forth, but can leave the specific security selection decisions within each investment class to fund managers. Shareholders hope that these portfolio managers can achieve better investment performance than they could obtain on their own.

What is the investment record of the mutual fund industry? This seemingly straightforward question is deceptively difficult to answer because we need a standard against which to evaluate performance. For example, we clearly would not want to compare the investment performance of an equity fund to the rate of return available in the money market. The vast differences in the risk of these two markets dictate that year-by-year as well as average performance will differ considerably. We would expect to find that equity funds outperform money market funds (on average) as compensation to investors for the extra risk incurred in equity markets. How then can we determine whether mutual fund portfolio managers are performing up to par given the level of risk they incur? In other words, what is the proper benchmark against which investment performance ought to be evaluated?

Measuring portfolio risk properly and using such measures to choose an appropriate benchmark is far from straightforward. We devote all of Parts Two and Three of the text to issues surrounding the proper measurement of portfolio risk and the trade-off between risk and return. In this chapter, therefore, we will satisfy ourselves with a first look at the question of fund performance by using only very simple performance benchmarks and ignoring the more subtle issues of risk differences across funds. However, we will return to this topic in Chapter 11, where we take a closer look at mutual fund performance after adjusting for differences in the exposure of portfolios to various sources of risk.

Here we use as a benchmark for the performance of equity fund managers the rate of return on the Wilshire 5000 index. Recall from Chapter 2 that this is a value-weighted index of the roughly 3,500 actively traded stocks in the U.S. The performance of the Wilshire 5000 is a useful benchmark with which to evaluate professional managers because it corresponds to a simple passive investment strategy: Buy all the shares in the index in proportion to their outstanding market value. Moreover, this is a feasible strategy for even small investors because the Vanguard Group offers an index fund (its Total Stock Market Portfolio) designed to replicate the performance of the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index, which is almost identical to the Wilshire 5000 index. Using the Wilshire 5000 index as a benchmark, we may pose the problem of evaluating the performance of mutual fund portfolio managers this way: How does the typical performance of actively managed equity mutual funds compare to the performance of a passively managed portfolio that simply replicates the composition of a broad index of the stock market?

Casual comparisons of the performance of the Wilshire 5000 index versus that of professionally managed mutual funds reveal disappointing results for active managers. Figure 4.4 shows that the asset-weighted average return on domestic U.S. equity funds was below the return on the Wilshire index in 30 of the 50 years from 1971 to 2020. The average annual return on the index was  $12.49\%$ , which was  $96\%$  greater than that of the average mutual fund.[7]

This result may seem surprising. After all, it would not seem unreasonable to expect that professional money managers should be able to outperform a very simple rule such as "hold an indexed portfolio." As it turns out, however, there may be good reasons to expect such a result. We explore them in detail in Chapter 11, where we discuss the efficient market hypothesis.

# 4.8 Information on Mutual Funds

The first place to find information on a mutual fund is in its prospectus. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that the prospectus describe the fund's investment objectives and policies in a concise "Statement of Investment Objectives" as well as in lengthy discussions of investment policies and risks. The fund's investment adviser and

Of course, actual funds incur trading costs while indexes do not, so a fair comparison between the returns on actively managed funds versus those on a passive index should first reduce the return on the Wilshire 5000 by an estimate of such costs. Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index portfolio charges an expense ratio of  $0.04\%$  (for investments above \$3,000) and, because it engages in little trading, incurs low trading costs. Therefore, it would be reasonable to reduce the returns on the index by no more than  $15\%$ . This reduction would not erase the difference in average performance.

its portfolio manager are also described. The prospectus also presents the costs associated with purchasing shares in the fund in a fee table. Sales charges such as front-end and back-end loads as well as annual operating expenses such as management fees and 12b-1 fees are detailed in the fee table.

Funds provide information about themselves in two other sources. The Statement of Additional Information (SAI), also known as Part B of the prospectus, includes a list of the securities in the portfolio at the end of the fiscal year, audited financial statements, a list of the directors and officers of the fund (as well as their personal investments in the fund), and data on brokerage commissions paid by the fund. However, unlike the fund prospectus, investors do not receive the SAI unless they specifically request it; one industry joke is that SAI stands for "something always ignored." The fund's annual report also includes portfolio composition and financial statements, as well as a discussion of the factors that influenced fund performance over the last reporting period.

With thousands of funds to choose from, it can be difficult to find and select the fund best suited for a particular need. Several publications now offer "encyclopedias" of mutual fund information to help in the search process. Morningstar's Web site, www.morningstar.com, is an excellent source of information, as is Yahoo!'s site, finance.yahoo.com/funds. The Investment Company Institute (www.ici.org), the national association of mutual funds, closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts, publishes an annual Directory of Mutual Funds that includes information on fees as well as contact information. To illustrate the range of information available about funds, we consider Morningstar's report on Fidelity's Small Cap Growth Fund, reproduced in Figure 4.5.

The top panel summarizes some of the fund's key characteristics, for example, its expense ratio (1.09\%), turnover rate (126\%), and dividend yield (zero). Included here is Morningstar's famous style box. In it, Morningstar evaluates style along two dimensions: One is the size of the firms held in the portfolio as measured by the market value of outstanding equity; the other is a value/growth measure. Morningstar defines value stocks as those with low ratios of market price per share to various measures of value. It puts stocks on a growth-value continuum based on the ratios of stock price to the firm's earnings, book value, sales, cash flow, and dividends. Value stocks are those with a low price relative to these measures of value. In contrast, growth stocks have high ratios, suggesting that investors in these firms must believe that the firm will experience rapid growth to justify the prices at which the stocks sell. In Figure 4.5, the shaded box in the bottom right of the Investment Style grid shows that Fidelity's Small Cap Fund tends to hold smaller firms (bottom row) and growth stocks (right column).

The bottom panel shows various statistics on the fund's investment performance in each of the last 10 years. You can compare returns to two benchmarks, either the other funds in the same small/growth category or a relevant stock market index, in this case, the Russell 2000 Growth Index. The rows labeled  $+/-$  Category or  $+/-$  Index present annual return differentials relative to each benchmark. The following rows show the fund's quartile as well as its percentile rank within its comparison group. The fund has been extremely successful, with performance in the top half of its comparison group in every year since 2013. This performance has earned the fund a 4-star rating. Of course, we are all accustomed to the disclaimer that "past performance is not a reliable measure of future results," and this is presumably true as well of Morningstar's star ratings. Indeed, performance so far in 2021 has been disappointing.

More data on the performance of the fund are provided in the graph in the middle of the figure. The top plot shows that an investment in the fund would have accumulated to a total return about  $25\%$  greater than the ones provided by either benchmark.

More information on the fund is given in other Morningstar pages.

1. Unit investment trusts, closed-end management companies, and open-end management companies are all classified and regulated as investment companies. Unit investment trusts are essentially unmanaged in the sense that the portfolio, once established, is fixed. Managed investment companies, in contrast, may change the composition of the portfolio as deemed fit by the portfolio manager. Closed-end funds are traded like other securities; they do not redeem shares for their investors. Open-end funds, more commonly known as mutual funds, will redeem shares for net asset value at the request of the investor.
2. Net asset value equals the market value of assets held by a fund minus the liabilities of the fund divided by the shares outstanding.
3. Mutual funds free the individual from many of the administrative burdens of owning individual securities and offer professional management of the portfolio. They also offer advantages that are available only to large-scale investors, such as lower trading costs and easier diversification. On the other hand, funds are assessed management fees and incur other expenses, which reduce the investor's rate of return. Funds also eliminate some of the individual's control over the timing of capital gains realizations.
4. Mutual funds are often categorized by investment policy. Major policy groups include money market funds; equity funds, which are further grouped according to emphasis on income versus growth or specialization by sector; bond funds; international funds; balanced funds; asset allocation funds; and index funds.
5. Costs of investing in mutual funds include front-end loads, which are sales charges; back-end loads, which are redemption fees or, more formally, contingent-deferred sales charges; operating expenses; and 12b-1 charges, which are recurring fees used to pay for the expenses of marketing the fund to the public.
6. Income earned on mutual fund portfolios is not taxed at the level of the fund. Instead, as long as the fund meets certain requirements for pass-through status, the income is treated as being earned by the investors in the fund.
7. The average rate of return of the average equity mutual fund in the last 50 years has been below that of a passive index fund holding a portfolio to replicate a broad-based index like the S&P 500 or Wilshire 5000. Some of the reasons for this disappointing record are the costs incurred by actively managed funds, such as the expense of conducting the research to guide stock-picking activities, and trading costs due to higher portfolio turnover.

The fund invests in a portfolio of stocks that provides dividend income at the end of the year of \$2 million. The stocks included in the fund's portfolio increase in price by 8\%, but no securities are sold and there are no capital gains distributions. The fund charges 12b-1 fees of 1\%, which are deducted from portfolio assets at year-end. What is the fund's net asset value at the start and end of the year? What is the rate of return for an investor in the fund?

What is your rate of return on the fund if you sell your shares at the end of the year?
19. Loaded-Up Fund charges a 12b-1 fee of  $1.0\%$  and maintains an expense ratio of .75\%. Economy Fund charges a front-end load of  $2\%$  but has no 12b-1 fee and has an expense ratio of .25\%. Assume the rate of return on both funds' portfolios (before any fees) is  $6\%$  per year. How much will an investment in each fund grow to after: a. 1 year?

b. 3 years?
c. 10 years?

20. City Street Fund has a portfolio of  \$450 million and liabilities of\$ 10 million.

21. The Investments Fund sells Class A shares with a front-end load of  $6\%$  and Class C shares with 12b-1 fees of  $5\%$  annually as well as back-end load fees that start at  $5\%$  and fall by  $1\%$  for each full year the investor holds the portfolio (until the fifth year). Assume the portfolio rate of return net of operating expenses is  $10\%$  annually. If you plan to sell the fund after 4 years, are Class A or Class C shares the better choice for you? What if you plan to sell after 15 years?

b. How does your answer change if you plan to invest for 6 years? Why does your answer change?
c. Now suppose that instead of a front-end load the fund assesses a 12b-1 fee of .75\% per year. What annual rate of return must the fund portfolio earn for you to be better off in the fund than in the CD? Does your answer in this case depend on your time horizon?

23. Suppose that every time a fund manager trades stock, transaction costs such as commissions and bid-ask spreads amount to  $.4\%$  of the value of the trade. If the portfolio turnover rate is  $50\%$ , by how much is the total return of the portfolio reduced by trading costs?
24. You expect a tax-free municipal bond portfolio to provide a rate of return of  $4\%$ . Management fees of the fund are  $6\%$ . What fraction of portfolio income is given up to fees? If the management fees for an equity fund also are  $6\%$ , but you expect a portfolio return of  $12\%$ , what fraction of portfolio income is given up to fees? Why might management fees be a bigger factor in your investment decision for bond funds than for stock funds? Can your conclusion help explain why unmanaged unit investment trusts tend to focus on the fixed-income market?

1. NAV =  $\frac{\$4,034.4 - \$81.8}{101.1} = \$39.102. The net investment in the Class A shares after the 4\% commission is $9,600. If the fund earns a 10\% return, the investment will grow after n years to \$9,600 × (1.10)n. The Class C shares have no front-end load. However, the net return to the investor after 12b-1 fees will be only 9.5\%. In addition, there is a back-end load that reduces the sales proceeds by a percentage equal to (5 – years until sale) until the fifth year, when the back-end load expires.

For a very short horizon such as 1 year, the Class A shares are the better choice. The front-end and back-end loads are equal, but the Class A shares don't have to pay the 12b-1 fees.

For moderate horizons such as 4 years, the Class C shares dominate because the front-end load of the Class A shares is more costly than the 12b-1 fees and the now-smaller exit fee. For long horizons of 10 years or more, Class A again dominates. In this case, the one-time front-end load is less expensive than the continuing 12b-1 fees.

# Risk, Return, and the Historical Record

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/da31ae4406210f7c5bba10f1fd6ab71f904335747be147794b1df3b0455237c9.jpg)

RISK CAN BE as important to investors as the expected return on their portfolios. Unfortunately, while we have theories about the proper relationship between risk and expected return, there is no theory about the levels of risk we should find in the marketplace. We can at best estimate from historical experience the level of risk that investors are likely to confront.

This situation is to be expected because prices of investment assets fluctuate in response to news about the fortunes of corporations, as well as to macroeconomic developments. There is no theory about the frequency and importance of such events; hence, we cannot determine a "natural" level of risk.

Compounding this difficulty is the fact that we can directly observe neither expected return nor risk. We observe only realized rates of return. These provide noisy estimates of the expected returns and risk that investors actually anticipated. Moreover, in learning from a historical record, we face what has become known as the "black swan" problem. No matter how long the historical record, there is never a guarantee that it exhibits the worst (or best) that nature might throw at us in the future.


In this chapter, we present tools for estimating expected returns and risk from the historical record. We begin with interest rates and investments in safe assets and examine the history of risk-free investments in the U.S. over the last 95 years. We also see how nominal interest rates depend on expected inflation rates.

Moving to risky assets, we begin with scenario analysis of risky investments and the data inputs necessary to conduct it. With this in mind, we develop the statistical tools needed to make inferences from historical time series of portfolio returns. We summarize the empirical evidence on the risk-reward trade-off over most of the last century and consider as well the incidence of extreme events confronting investors.

# 5.1 Measuring Returns over Different Holding Periods

Throughout the chapter, we will examine and compare rates of return on various securities. Before we can do this properly, however, we first need to learn how to compare investment returns over different holding periods.

We start with the simplest security, a zero-coupon bond that pays its owner only one cash flow, for example,  \$100, on the maturity date. The investor buys the bond for less than face value (face value is just the terminology for the ultimate payoff value of the bond, in this case,\$ 100), so the total return is the difference between the initial purchase price and the ultimate payment of face value.

If we call  $P(T)$  the price paid today for a zero with maturity date  $T$ , then over the life of the bond, the value of the investment grows by the multiple  $100 / P(T)$ . The percentage increase in the value of the investment is

$$ r (T) = \frac {1 0 0}{P (T)} - 1 \tag {5.1}
$$

We can equivalently write this return over the holding period as

$$
\text {H o l d i n g p e r i o d r e t u r n} = r (T) = \frac {\text {P r i c e i n c r e a s e} + \text {I n c o m e}}{P (T)} = \frac {1 0 0 - P (T) + 0}{P (T)}
$$

It is no surprise that if you are willing to invest your money for longer periods, you should expect to earn higher total returns. The zero-coupon bond with longer maturity will have a lower present value and a lower price, therefore providing a higher total return. But this observation raises the obvious question of how we should compare returns on investments with differing horizons. We must re-express each total return as a rate of return over a common period. We typically express an investment return as an effective annual rate (EAR), defined as the percentage increase in funds per year.

Table 5.1 illustrates. Column 2 presents prices of zero-coupon bonds with  \ {100}  face value and various maturities. The total return on each security is calculated from Equation 5.1 and presented in column 3. The final column re-expresses the total return as an effective annual return.

For the one-year investment, the EAR is simply the total return on the bond, the percentage increase in the value of the investment, which is  $4.69\%$ . For investments that last less than one year, let's say six months, we would compound the half-year return. In the top row of the table (labeled half-year), we see that the semiannual return is  $2.71\%$ , so the EAR, the annual rate at which the investment increases, is found by compounding as follows:  $1 + \mathrm{EAR} = 1.0271^{2} = 1.0549$ , implying that  $\mathrm{EAR} = 5.49\%$ .

<table><tr><td>Horizon, T</td><td>Price, P(T)</td><td>r(T) = 100 / (P(T) - 1)</td><td>EAR over Given Horizon</td></tr><tr><td>Half-year</td><td>\$97.36</td><td>100/97.36 - 1 = 0.0271 = 2.71\%</td><td>(1 + .0271)2 - 1 = .0549</td></tr><tr><td>1 year</td><td>\$95.52</td><td>100/95.52 - 1 = 0.0469 = 4.69\%</td><td>(1 + .0469) - 1 = 0.0469</td></tr><tr><td>25 years</td><td>23.30</td><td>100/23.30 - 1 = 3.2918 = 329.18\%</td><td>(1 + 3.2918)1/25 - 1 = .060</td></tr></table>

# Table 5.1

Annualized rates of return. Prices and returns on zero-coupon bonds with face value of 100 and different maturities.

For investments longer than a year, the convention is to express the EAR as the annual rate that would compound to the same value as the actual investment. For example, the investment in the 25-year bond in Table 5.1 grows by its maturity by a multiple of 4.2918 (i.e.,  $1 + 3.2918$ ), so its EAR is found by solving

$$
(1 + \mathrm {E A R}) ^ {2 5} = 4. 2 9 1 8
$$

$$
1 + \mathrm {E A R} = 4. 2 9 1 8 ^ {1 / 2 5} = 1. 0 6 0 0
$$

Therefore,  $\mathrm{EAR} = 0.06$  or  $6\%$ .

# Annual Percentage Rates

Effective annual rates explicitly account for compound interest. In contrast, rates on short-term investments (by convention, with holding periods less than a year), are in practice often annualized using simple interest that ignores compounding. These are called annual percentage rates, or APRs. For example, the APR reported on your credit card is the monthly interest rate you pay on outstanding balances multiplied by 12.

With  $n$  compounding periods per year, we can find the EAR from the APR by first computing the per-period rate as  $\mathrm{APR} / n$  and then compounding for  $n$  periods:

$$
1 + \mathrm {E A R} = \left(1 + \frac {\mathrm {A P R}}{n}\right) ^ {n} \tag {5.2}
$$

Equivalently, we can find the APR from the EAR by first finding the per-period rate (the term in square brackets in Equation 5.3), and then multiplying by the number of periods in a year:

$$
\mathrm {A P R} = n \times \left[ (1 + \mathrm {E A R}) ^ {1 / n} - 1 \right] \tag {5.3}
$$

To illustrate, in the middle columns of Table 5.2 we use Equation 5.3 to solve for the APR corresponding to an effective annual return of  $5.8\%$  with various compounding periods. Conversely, in the set of columns on the right, we use Equation 5.2 to find the EAR implied by an APR of  $5.8\%$ .

# Example 5.1 EAR versus APR

Suppose you must pay  $1.5\%$  interest per month on your outstanding credit card balance. The APR would be reported as  $1.5\% \times 12 = 18\%$ , but the effective annual rate is higher,  $19.56\%$ , because  $1.015^{12} - 1 = .1956$ . Until you pay off your outstanding balance, it will increase each month by the multiple 1.015, so after 12 months, the balance will increase by  $1.015^{12}$ . This is why we call the EAR an effective rate.

# Continuous Compounding

It is evident from Table 5.2 that the difference between APR and EAR grows with the frequency of compounding. (Why is this not surprising?) This raises the question: How far will these two rates diverge as the compounding frequency continues to grow? As  $n$  gets ever larger in Equation 5.2, we effectively approach continuous compounding (CC), and the relation of EAR to the annual percentage rate, denoted by  $r_{cc}$  for the continuously compounded case, is given by the exponential function

$$
1 + \operatorname {E A R} = \exp \left(r _ {c c}\right) = e ^ {r _ {c c}} \tag {5.4}
$$ where  $e$  is approximately 2.71828.

To find  $r_{cc}$  from the effective annual rate, we solve Equation 5.4 for  $r_{cc}$  as follows:

$$
\ln (1 + \mathrm {E A R}) = r _ {c c}
$$ where  $\ln (\bullet)$  is the natural logarithm function, the inverse of  $\exp (\bullet)$ . Both the exponential and logarithmic functions are available in Excel and are called  $\mathrm{EXP}(\bullet)$  and  $\mathrm{LN}(\bullet)$ , respectively.


# Example 5.2 Continuously Compounded Rates

The continuously compounded annual percentage rate,  $r_{cc}$ , that provides an EAR of  $5.8\%$  is  $5.638\%$  (see Table 5.2). This is virtually the same as the APR for daily compounding. But for less frequent compounding, for example, semiannually, the APR necessary to provide the same EAR is noticeably higher,  $5.718\%$ . With less frequent compounding, a higher APR is necessary to provide an equivalent effective return.

While continuous compounding may at first seem to be a mathematical nuisance, working with such rates can sometimes simplify calculations of expected return and risk. For example, given a continuously compounded rate, the total return for any period  $T$ ,  $r_{cc}(T)$ , is simply  $\exp (T\times r_{cc})$ . In other words, the total return scales up in direct proportion to the time period,  $T$ . This is far simpler than working with the exponents that arise using discrete period compounding.

# Concept Check 5.1

# 5.2 Interest Rates and Inflation Rates

The level of interest rates is among the most important macroeconomic factors guiding one's investment analysis. Interest rates directly determine expected returns in the fixed-income market. If your expectation is that rates will increase by more than the consensus view, you will want to shy away from longer term fixed-income securities. Similarly, increases in interest rates tend to be bad news for the stock market.

Unfortunately, forecasting interest rates is one of the most notoriously difficult parts of applied macroeconomics. Nonetheless, we do have a good understanding of the fundamental factors that determine the level of interest rates:

1. The supply of funds from savers, primarily households.
2. The demand for funds from businesses to be used to finance investments in plant, equipment, and inventories (real assets or capital formation).
3. The government's net demand for funds as modified by actions of the Federal Reserve Bank.
4. The expected rate of inflation.

We begin by distinguishing real from nominal interest rates.

# Real and Nominal Rates of Interest

When prices of goods and services change, we need to distinguish between nominal and real rates of return. When you invest money in a bank account, for example, you are typically quoted a nominal interest rate. This is the rate at which the dollar value of your account grows. In contrast, the real interest rate is the rate at which the goods you can buy with your funds grows.

To illustrate, suppose that one year ago you deposited  \$1,000 in a 1-year bank deposit guaranteeing a rate of interest of 10\%$ . You are about to collect 1,100 in cash. What is the real return on your investment? That depends on what your money can buy today relative to what you could buy a year ago. The consumer price index (CPI) measures purchasing power by averaging the prices of goods and services in the consumption basket of an average urban family of four.

Suppose the rate of inflation (denoted by  $i$ ) is running at  $i = 6\%$ . So a loaf of bread that cost \$1 last year might cost \$1.06 this year. Last year you could buy 1,000 loaves with your funds. After investing for a year, you can buy $1,100/$1.06 = 1,038 loaves. The rate at which your purchasing power has increased is therefore 3.8\%.

Part of your earnings have been offset by the reduction in the purchasing power of the dollars you will receive at the end of the year. With a  $10\%$  interest rate, after you net out the  $6\%$  reduction in the purchasing power of money, you are left with a net increase in purchasing power of almost  $4\%$ .

More generally, we find the proportional increase in purchasing power by dividing the growth of invested funds by the growth of prices. If we call  $r_{\mathrm{nom}}$  the nominal interest rate,  $r_{\mathrm{real}}$  the real rate, and  $i$  the inflation rate, then we conclude

$$
1 + r _ {\text {r e a l}} = \frac {1 + r _ {\text {n o m}}}{1 + i} = \frac {1 . 1 0}{1 . 0 6} = 1. 0 3 8 \tag {5.5}
$$

Equation 5.5 can be rearranged to solve for the real rate as:

$$ r _ {\text {r e a l}} = \frac {r _ {\text {n o m}} - i}{1 + i} \tag {5.6}
$$

A common approximation to this relation is

$$ r _ {\text {r e a l}} \approx r _ {\text {n o m}} - i \tag {5.7}
$$

In words, the real rate of interest is the nominal rate reduced by the loss of purchasing power resulting from inflation. This approximation rule overstates the actual real rate by the multiple  $1 + i$ .

# Example 5.3 Approximating the Real Rate

If the nominal interest rate on a 1-year CD is  $8\%$ , and you expect inflation to be  $5\%$  over the coming year, then using the approximation formula, you expect the real rate of interest to be  $r_{\mathrm{real}} = 8\% - 5\% = 3\%$ . Using the exact formula, the real rate is  $r_{\mathrm{real}} = \frac{.08 - .05}{1 + .05} = .0286$ , or  $2.86\%$ . Therefore, the approximation overstates the expected real rate by  $14\%$  (14 basis points). The approximation is more accurate for small inflation rates and is perfectly exact for continuously compounded rates. $^2$

Conventional fixed income investments, for example, bank certificates of deposit, promise a nominal rate of interest. However, because future inflation is uncertain, the real rate of return that you will earn is risky even if the nominal rate is risk-free. Thus, you can only infer the expected real rate on these investments by adjusting the nominal rate for your expectation of the rate of inflation.

# The Equilibrium Real Rate of Interest

Although there are many different interest rates economywide (as many as there are types of debt securities), these rates tend to move together, so economists frequently talk as if there were a single representative rate. Three basic factors—supply, demand, and government actions—determine the real interest rate. The nominal interest rate is the real rate plus the expected rate of inflation.

Figure 5.1 shows a downward-sloping demand curve and an upward-sloping supply curve. On the horizontal axis, we measure the quantity of funds, and on the vertical axis, we measure the real rate of interest.

The supply curve slopes up from left to right because the higher the real interest rate, the greater the supply of household savings. The assumption is that at higher real interest rates, households will choose to postpone some current consumption and set aside or invest more of their disposable income for future use.

The demand curve slopes down from left to right because businesses will want to invest in more physical capital when the real interest rate on the funds needed to finance those projects is lower. Equivalently, project net present value is higher when the discount rate is lower, so more projects are worth pursuing.

Equilibrium is at the point of intersection of the supply and demand curves, point  $E$  in Figure 5.1.

For continuously compounded rates, Equation 5.7 is perfectly accurate. Because  $\ln (x / y) = \ln (x) - \ln (y)$ , the continuously compounded real rate of return,  $r_{cc}(\mathrm{real})$ , can be derived from the effective annual real rate,  $r_{\mathrm{real}}$ , as

$$ r _ {c c} (\text {r e a l}) = \ln (1 + r _ {\text {r e a l}}) = \ln \left(\frac {1 + r _ {\text {n o m}}}{1 + i}\right) = \ln (1 + r _ {\text {n o m}}) - \ln (1 + i) = r _ {c c} (\text {n o m}) - i _ {c c}
$$

The government and the central bank (the Federal Reserve) can shift these supply and demand curves either to the right or to the left through fiscal and monetary policies. For example, an increase in the government's budget deficit increases the government's borrowing demand and shifts the demand curve to the right, which causes the equilibrium real interest rate to rise to point  $E'$ . The Fed can offset such a rise through an expansionary monetary policy, which will shift the supply curve to the right.

Thus, although the fundamental determinants of the real interest rate are the propensity of households to save and the expected profitability of investment in physical capital, the real rate can be affected as well by government fiscal and monetary policies.

Figure 5.1 Determination of the equilibrium real rate of interest

# Interest Rates and Inflation

Equation 5.7 tells us that the nominal rate of return on an asset is approximately equal to the real rate plus inflation. Because investors should be concerned with real returns— their increase in purchasing power—they will demand higher nominal interest rates when expected inflation is higher. The nominal rate must rise along with inflation to maintain the expected real return.

Irving Fisher (1930) argued that the nominal rate ought to increase one-for-one with expected inflation,  $E(i)$ . The so-called Fisher hypothesis is

$$ r _ {\text {n o m}} = r _ {\text {r e a l}} + E (i) \tag {5.8}
$$

The Fisher hypothesis implies that when real rates are stable, changes in nominal rates ought to predict changes in inflation rates. Suppose the real rate of interest is  $2\%$ , and expected inflation is  $4\%$ , so that the nominal interest rate is about  $6\%$ . If expected inflation rises to  $5\%$ , the nominal interest rate should climb to roughly  $7\%$ . The increase in the nominal rate offsets the increase in expected inflation, giving investors an unchanged growth rate of purchasing power of  $2\%$ .

# Concept Check 5.2 a. Suppose the real interest rate is  $3\%$  per year and the expected inflation rate is  $8\%$ . According to the Fisher hypothesis, what is the nominal interest rate?

b. Suppose the expected inflation rate rises to  $10\%$ , but the real rate is unchanged. What happens to the nominal interest rate?

# Taxes and the Real Rate of Interest

Tax liabilities are based on nominal income and the tax rate is determined by the investor's tax bracket. Congress recognized the resultant "bracket creep" (when nominal income grows due to inflation and pushes taxpayers into higher brackets) and mandated index-linked tax brackets in the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

However, index-linked tax brackets do not provide relief from the effect of inflation on the taxation of savings. Given a tax rate  $(t)$  and a nominal interest rate,  $r_{\mathrm{nom}}$ , the after-tax interest rate is  $r_{\mathrm{nom}}(1 - t)$ . The real after-tax rate is approximately the after-tax nominal rate minus the inflation rate:

$$ r _ {\text {n o m}} (1 - t) - i = \left(r _ {\text {r e a l}} + i\right) (1 - t) - i = r _ {\text {r e a l}} (1 - t) - i t \tag {5.9}
$$

Equation 5.9 tells us that, because you pay taxes on even the portion of interest earnings that is merely compensation for inflation, your after-tax real return falls by the tax rate times the inflation rate. If, for example, you are in a  $30\%$  tax bracket and your investments provide a nominal return of  $12\%$  while inflation runs at  $8\%$ , your before-tax real rate is approximately  $4\%$ , and you should, in an inflation-protected tax system, net an after-tax real return of  $4\%(1 - .3) = 2.8\%$ . But the tax code does not recognize that the first  $8\%$  of your return is only compensation for inflation—not real income. Your after-tax nominal return is  $12\%(1 - .3) = 8.4\%$ , so your after-tax real interest rate is only  $8.4\% - 8\% = .4\%$ . As predicted by Equation 5.9, your after-tax real return has fallen by  $it = 8\% \times .3 = 2.4\%$ .

The Fisher equation predicts that the nominal rate of interest should track the expected inflation rate, leaving the real rate relatively stable. But both the equilibrium real interest rate and the actual inflation rate evolve with some unpredictability. The nominal rate will inherit the uncertainty of both. What is the historical record?

Table 5.3 summarizes the history of returns on 1-month U.S. Treasury bills, the inflation rate, and the resultant real rate. You can find the entire post-1926 history of the monthly rates of these series in Connect (link to the material for Chapter 5).

The first set of columns of Table 5.3 presents average annual rates for three periods. The average interest rate over the more recent portion of our history, 1952-2021 (essentially the post-war period),  $4.14\%$ , was noticeably higher than in the earlier portion,  $0.95\%$ . The reason is inflation, the main driver of T-bill rates, which also had a noticeably higher average value,  $3.46\%$ , in the later portion of the sample than in the earlier period,  $1.80\%$ . Nevertheless, nominal interest rates in the recent period were still high enough to leave a higher average real rate,  $0.68\%$ , compared with a negative 48 basis points  $(-.48\%)$  for the earlier period.

Figure 5.2 Interest and inflation rates, 1927-2021.

Figure 5.2 shows why we divide the sample period at 1952. After that year, inflation is far less volatile, and, probably as a result, the nominal interest rate tracks the inflation rate with far greater precision, resulting in a far more stable real interest rate. This shows up as the dramatic reduction in the standard deviation of the real rate documented in the last column of Table 5.3. Whereas the standard deviation is  $6.34\%$  in the early part of the sample, it is only  $2.27\%$  in the later portion. The lower standard deviation of the real rate in the post-1951 period reflects a similar decline in the standard deviation of the inflation rate. We conclude that the Fisher relation appears to work far better when inflation is itself more predictable and investors can more accurately gauge the nominal interest rate they require to provide an acceptable real rate of return.

In that regard, notice the spike in the spread between inflation and the T-bill rate in the last year of our sample, 2021. In the wake of the COVID pandemic, both supply chain disruptions and aggressive government policies to stimulate the economy led to unexpected levels of inflation, the highest since the 1980s. The real rate of return on Treasury bills in 2021 was roughly  $-7\%$ , a historically low and undoubtedly unexpected value.

# 5.3 Risk and Risk Premiums

Any investment involves some uncertainty about future holding-period returns, and in many cases that uncertainty is considerable. Sources of investment risk range from macroeconomic fluctuations, to the changing fortunes of various industries, to firm-specific unexpected developments. In this section, we will begin thinking about how to measure this risk.

# Holding-Period Returns

You are considering investing in a mutual fund. The fund currently sells for 100 per share. With an investment horizon of one year, the realized rate of return on your investment will depend on (a) the price per share at year's end and (b) the dividends you will collect over the year.

Suppose the end-of-year price per share is  \$110 and cash dividends over the year amount to\$ 4. The realized return, called the holding-period return, or HPR (in this case, the holding period is one year), is defined as

$$
\mathrm {H P R} = \frac {\text {E n d i n g p r i c e o f a s h a r e - B e g i n n i n g p r i c e + C a s h d i v i d e n d}}{\text {B e g i n n i n g p r i c e}} \tag {5.10}
$$

Here we have

$$
\mathrm{HPR} = \frac{\mathbb{S}110 - \mathbb{S}100 + \mathbb{S}4}{\mathbb{S}100} = .14,\text{or} 14\%
$$

The percent return from dividends is called the dividend yield, and so dividend yield plus the rate of capital gains equals HPR.

# Expected Return and Standard Deviation

There is considerable uncertainty about share prices one year from now, so you cannot be sure about your eventual HPR. We can organize our beliefs about possible outcomes by positing various economic scenarios as well as their probabilities. Therefore, this approach is called scenario analysis. We present an illustrative scenario analysis in columns A through E of Spreadsheet 5.1. The list of possible HPRs along with their associated probabilities is called the probability distribution of the HPR.

# Spreadsheet 5.1

Scenario analysis of holding-period return of the mutual fund

How can we characterize this probability distribution? To start, we measure the expected or mean rate of return,  $E(r)$ , and the standard deviation,  $\sigma$ . The expected rate of return is a probability-weighted average of the rates of return in each scenario. Calling  $p(s)$  the probability of each scenario and  $r(s)$  the HPR in each scenario, where scenarios are labeled or "indexed" by  $s$ , we write the expected return as

$$
E (r) = \sum_ {s} p (s) r (s) \tag {5.11}
$$

Applying this formula to the data in Spreadsheet 5.1, the expected rate of return on the fund is

$$
E (r) = (. 2 5 \times . 3 1) + (. 4 5 \times . 1 4) + [. 2 5 \times (-. 0 6 7 5) ] + [. 0 5 \times (-. 5 2) ] = . 0 9 7 6
$$

Spreadsheet 5.1 shows that this sum can be evaluated easily in Excel, using the SUMPRODUCT function, which first calculates the products of a series of number pairs, and then sums the products. Here, the number pair is the probability of each scenario and the rate of return. For example, SUMPRODUCT(B8:B11,E8:E11) multiplies each element of the first column specified (column B) by the corresponding element of the second column (column E), and then adds up each of those products. In Spreadsheet 5.1, each of these products would be the probability of each scenario times the holding period return in that scenario. The sum of those products is the expected return (see Equation 5.11).

However, the investment in the fund is risky and the actual return may be (a lot) more or less than its mean value. In the best-case boom scenario, the return will be better,  $31\%$ , but in a severe recession, the return will be a disappointing  $-52\%$ . How can we quantify this uncertainty?

The "surprise" return in any scenario is the difference between the actual return and the expected return. For example, in a boom, the surprise is  $31\% - E(r) = 31\% - 9.76\% = 21.24\%$ . In a severe recession, the surprise is  $-52\% - E(r) = -52\% - 9.76\% = -61.76\%$ .

We will measure investment uncertainty using the typical magnitude of deviations of actual returns around the mean return. However, to prevent positive deviations from canceling out with negative ones, we start with squared deviations from the expected return because squared deviations are all positive. The expected value of those squared deviations (the expected squared "surprise" across scenarios) is called variance, which we denote as  $\sigma^2$ , and calculate as:

$$
\operatorname {V a r} (r) = \sigma^ {2} = \sum_ {s} p (s) [ r (s) - E (r) ] ^ {2} \tag {5.12}
$$

Therefore, in our example,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma^ {2} = . 2 5 (. 3 1 -. 0 9 7 6) ^ {2} +. 4 5 (. 1 4 -. 0 9 7 6) ^ {2} +. 2 5 (-. 0 6 7 5 -. 0 9 7 6) ^ {2} \\ + . 0 5 (-. 5 2 -. 0 9 7 6) ^ {2} = . 0 3 8 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

This value is calculated in cell G13 of Spreadsheet 5.1 using the SUMPRODUCT function. Specifically, SUMPRODUCT(B8:B11,G8:G11) multiplies the probability of each scenario by the squared deviation from the mean in that scenario (column G), adds up those terms, and thus provides the variance of returns (Equation 5.12).

When we square deviations from the mean, we change units. To get back to original units, we calculate the standard deviation as the square root of variance. Standard deviation is calculated in cell G14 as

$$
\sigma = \sqrt {.0380} = .1949 = 19.49 \%
$$

Clearly, what would trouble potential investors in the fund is the downside risk of a crash or poor market, not the upside potential of a good or excellent market. The standard deviation of the rate of return does not distinguish between good or bad surprises; it treats both simply as deviations from the mean. Nevertheless, as long as the probability distribution is more or less symmetric about the mean,  $\sigma$  is a reasonable measure of risk. In the special case where we can assume that the probability distribution is normal—represented by the well-known bell-shaped curve— $E(r)$  and  $\sigma$  completely characterize the distribution.


# Excess Returns and Risk Premiums

How much would you invest in the mutual fund? First, you must ask how much of an expected reward is offered for the risk that investment would entail.

We measure the reward as the difference between the expected HPR on the mutual fund and the risk-free rate, that is, the rate you would earn in risk-free assets such as T-bills, money market funds, or the bank. We call this difference the risk premium. The risk-free rate in our example is  $4\%$  per year, and the expected return on the fund is  $9.76\%$ , so the risk premium is  $5.76\%$  per year. The difference in any particular period between the actual rate of return on a risky asset and the risk-free rate is called the excess return. Therefore, the risk premium is the expected value of the excess return, and the standard deviation of the excess return is a measure of its risk.

The degree to which investors are willing to commit funds to stocks depends on their risk aversion. Investors are risk averse in the sense that, if the risk premium were zero, they would be unwilling to invest any money in stocks. In theory, there must always be a positive risk premium on stocks to induce risk-averse investors to hold the existing supply of stocks instead of placing all their money in risk-free assets.

You invest \$27,000 in a corporate bond selling for $900 per $1,000 par value. Over the coming year, the bond will pay interest of \$75 per 1,000 of par value. The price of the bond at the end of the year will depend on the level of interest rates prevailing at that time. You construct the following scenario analysis:

Your alternative investment is a T-bill that yields a sure rate of return of  $5\%$ . Calculate the HPR for each scenario, the expected rate of return, and the risk premium on your investment. What is the expected end-of-year dollar value of your investment?

# The Reward-to-Volatility (Sharpe) Ratio

We can now begin to think about how to evaluate the performance of alternative portfolios. Specifically, what risk-return trade-off do they offer?

Investors presumably are interested in the expected excess return they can earn by shifting from T-bills into a risky portfolio, as well as the risk they would thereby incur. Even if the T-bill rate is not constant, we still know with certainty what nominal rate we will earn in any period if we purchase a bill and hold it to maturity. Other investments typically entail accepting some risk in return for the prospect of earning more than the safe T-bill rate. Investors price risky assets so that the risk premium will be commensurate with the risk of that expected excess return, and hence it's best to measure risk by the standard deviation of excess, not total, returns.


The importance of the trade-off between reward (the risk premium) and risk (as measured by standard deviation or SD) suggests that we measure the attraction of a portfolio by the ratio of its risk premium to the SD of its excess returns. This reward-to-volatility measure was first used extensively by William Sharpe and hence is commonly known as the Sharpe ratio. It is widely used to evaluate the performance of investment managers.

$$
\text {S h a r p e} = \frac {\text {R i s k p r e m i u m}}{\text {S D o f e x c e s s r e t u r n}} \tag {5.13}
$$

# Example 5.4 Sharpe Ratio

Take another look at Spreadsheet 5.1. The scenario analysis implied a risk premium of  $5.76\%$  and standard deviation of excess returns of  $19.49\%$ . This results in a Sharpe ratio of .30. (A warning: We will see in Chapter 7 that while the Sharpe ratio is an adequate measure of the risk-return trade-off for diversified portfolios, the subject of this chapter, it is inadequate when applied to individual assets such as shares of stock.)

# 5.4 The Normal Distribution

In Spreadsheet 5.1 we specified several economic scenarios, the likelihood of each, and the portfolio return in each scenario. These assumptions define the probability distribution of the rate of return. But how do evaluate whether our assumptions are reasonable? Surely, historical experience must provide some guidance, so let's start by taking a quick look at that history.

Figure 5.3 is the frequency distribution of monthly returns for the broad market index over the last 95 years, 1927-2021. We will have much to say about the specifics of this distribution shortly, but for now, we simply observe that it seems well described by the familiar bell-shaped curve of the normal distribution. This is one of the reasons that analysts commonly employ the assumption that market returns are at least approximately normally distributed. Let's begin, therefore, with a brief review of that distribution.

The normal distribution is central to the theory and practice of investments. Its plot is symmetric, with identical values for all three standard measures of "typical" results: the mean (the expected value discussed earlier), the median (the value above and below which we expect to observe  $50\%$  of the outcomes), and the mode (the most likely value).

Figure 5.4 illustrates a normal distribution with a mean of  $10\%$  and standard deviation (SD) of  $20\%$ . Notice that the probabilities are highest for outcomes near the mean and are significantly lower for outcomes far from the mean.

But what do we mean by an outcome "far" from the mean? A return  $15\%$  below the mean would hardly be noteworthy if typical volatility were high—for example, if the standard deviation of returns were  $20\%$ —but that same outcome would be highly unusual if the standard deviation were only  $5\%$ . For this reason, it is often useful to think about deviations from the mean in terms of how many standard deviations they represent. If the standard deviation is  $20\%$ , that  $15\%$  negative surprise would be only three-fourths of a standard deviation, unfortunate perhaps, but not uncommon. But if the standard deviation were only  $5\%$ , a  $15\%$  deviation would be a "three-sigma event," and quite rare.

# Example 5.5 Normal Distribution Function in Excel

Suppose the monthly rate of return on the S&P 500 is approximately normally distributed with a mean of  $1\%$  and standard deviation of  $6\%$ . What is the probability that the return on the index in any month will be negative? We can use Excel's built-in functions to quickly answer this question. The probability of observing an outcome less than some cutoff according to the normal distribution function is given as NORM.DIST(cutoff, mean, standard deviation, TRUE). In this case, we want to know the probability of an outcome below zero when the mean is  $1\%$  and the standard deviation is  $6\%$ , so we compute NORM.DIST(0, 1, 6, TRUE) = .4338. We could also use Excel's built-in standard normal function, NORM.S.DIST, which uses a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, and ask for the probability of an outcome 1/6 of a standard deviation below the mean: NORM.S.DIST(-1/6, TRUE) = .4338.

Figure 5.4 The normal distribution with mean  $10\%$  and standard deviation  $20\%$

Investment management is far more tractable when rates of return can be well approximated by the normal distribution. First, because the distribution is symmetric, the probability of any positive deviation above the mean is equal to that of a negative deviation of the same magnitude. Absent symmetry, the standard deviation would be an incomplete measure of risk. Second, the normal distribution belongs to a special family of distributions characterized as "stable" because of the following property: When assets with normally distributed returns are mixed to construct a portfolio, the portfolio return also is normally distributed. Third, the distribution is fully characterized by only two parameters (mean and SD). This greatly simplifies the task of assigning probabilities to possible scenarios. Fourth, when constructing portfolios of securities, we must account for the statistical dependence of returns across securities. Generally, such dependence is a complex, multilayered relationship. But when securities are normally distributed, the statistical relation between returns can be summarized with a single correlation coefficient.

How closely must actual return distributions fit the normal curve to justify its use in investment management? Clearly, the normal curve cannot be a perfect description of reality. For example, actual returns cannot be less than  $-100\%$ , which the normal distribution would not rule out. But this does not mean that the normal curve cannot still be useful. A similar issue arises in many other contexts. For example, birth weight is typically evaluated in comparison to a normal curve of newborn weights, although no baby is born with a negative weight. The normal distribution still is useful here because the SD of the weight is small relative to its mean, and the predicted likelihood of a negative weight would be too trivial to matter.[6]

In fact, the standard deviation is 511 grams while the mean is 3,958 grams. A negative weight would therefore be 7.74 standard deviations below the mean, and according to the normal distribution would have probability of only  $4.97 \times 10^{-15}$ . The issue of negative birth weight clearly isn't a practical concern.

In a similar spirit, we must identify criteria to determine the adequacy of the normality assumption for rates of return.

# 5.5 Deviations from Normality and Tail Risk

As we already noted (but you can't repeat it too often!), normality of excess returns hugely simplifies portfolio selection. Normality assures us that the standard deviation is a complete measure of risk and, hence, the Sharpe ratio is a complete measure of portfolio performance. Unfortunately, deviations from normality of asset returns are potentially significant and dangerous to ignore.

One potentially important departure from normality relates to any asymmetry in the probability distribution of returns. For example, what if large negative returns are more likely than large positive ones? The standard measure of this sort of asymmetry is called the skew of the distribution.

Just as variance is the average value of squared deviations from the average, skew is the average cubed deviation from the mean, expressed as a multiple of the third power of the standard deviation. (The ^ in the denominator indicates that we are calculating skew using an estimate of standard deviation.)

$$
\operatorname {S k e w} = \text {A v e r a g e} \left[ \frac {\left(R - \bar {R}\right) ^ {3}}{\hat {\sigma} ^ {3}} \right] \tag {5.14}
$$

When negative deviations are raised to an odd power, the result remains negative. Therefore, negative values of skew indicate that extreme bad outcomes are more frequent than extreme positive ones. We call these distributions "skewed to the left." If skew is positive, then extreme positive outcomes dominate, and these distributions are said to be skewed to the right.

Figure 5.5 shows both positively and negatively skewed distributions as well as the symmetric normal. Notice that the negatively skewed distribution has a "fatter" left tail than the normal with higher probabilities of extreme negative outcomes, while the positively skewed distribution has a fatter right tail.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/2ff218c9b4cff36dfce93be6d0a146c13169dab7ac762d85184547f665e7b6a6.jpg)
Figure 5.5 Normal and skewed distributions (mean = 6\%, SD = 17\%)


When the distribution is positively skewed (skewed to the right), the standard deviation overestimates risk because extreme positive surprises (which do not concern investors) nevertheless increase the estimate of volatility. Conversely, and more important, when the distribution is negatively skewed, the SD will underestimate risk.

Another potentially important departure from normality, kurtosis, concerns the likelihood of extreme values on either side of the mean at the expense of a smaller likelihood of moderate deviations. High kurtosis means that there is more probability mass in the tails of the distribution than predicted by the normal distribution. That extra probability is taken at the expense of "slender shoulders," that is, there is less probability mass near the center of the distribution. Figure 5.6 superimposes a "fat-tailed" distribution on a normal distribution with the same mean and SD. Although symmetry is still preserved, the SD will underestimate the likelihood of extreme events: large losses as well as large gains.


Kurtosis measures the degree of fat tails. It is calculated from the average value of deviations raised to the fourth power (expressed as a multiple of the fourth power of the standard deviation). Because the deviations are raised to the fourth power while they are raised only to the second power when calculating variance, kurtosis is much more sensitive to extreme outcomes and therefore is a natural measure of tail risk, that is, the risk of outcomes in the far tails of the probability distribution.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/2535d0bcc2d630cc3588c939995fc59fe1ccd417839ea8d35c4daca6588f4a51.jpg)

$$

We subtract 3 in Equation 5.15 because the expected value of the ratio for a normal distribution is 3. Thus, this formula for kurtosis uses the normal distribution as a benchmark: The kurtosis for the normal distribution is, in effect, defined as zero, so kurtosis above zero is a sign of fatter tails. The kurtosis of the distribution in Figure 5.6, which has visible fat tails, is .35. The Excel functions for skew and kurtosis are SKEW and KURT respectively.

# Concept Check 5.5

Spreadsheet 5.2 (on page 144) presents holding-period returns over a hypothetical five-year period. Calculate the skew and kurtosis of the five holding period returns.

Skew and kurtosis are standard statistical characteristics of distributions. In addition to these formal measures, practitioners, who are especially concerned about vulnerability to large losses, have devised other, perhaps more intuitive, measures of downside risk. We present four of the most frequently used in practice: value at risk, expected shortfall, lower partial standard deviation, and the frequency of extreme (3-sigma) returns.

# Value at Risk

Suppose you worry about worst-case outcomes for your portfolio. You might ask, "How much would I lose in a fairly extreme outcome, for example, if my return were in the 5th or 1st percentile of the distribution?" This loss is called the value at risk (and is denoted VaR to distinguish it from Var, the abbreviation for variance). VaR is the loss corresponding to a very low percentile of the entire return distribution. Therefore, it is another name for the quantile of a distribution. The quantile,  $q$ , of a distribution is the value below which lie  $q\%$  of the possible values. Thus, the median is  $q = 50$ th quantile. Practitioners commonly estimate the  $1\%$  VaR, meaning that  $99\%$  of returns will exceed the VaR, and  $1\%$  of returns will be worse. Therefore, the  $1\%$  VaR may be viewed as the cutoff separating the  $1\%$  worst-case future scenarios from the rest of the distribution.


When portfolio returns are normally distributed, the VaR is fully determined by the mean and SD of the distribution. Recalling that  $-2.33$  is the first percentile of the standard normal distribution (with mean  $= 0$  and  $\mathrm{SD} = 1$ ), the  $1\%$  VaR for a normal distribution is

$$
\mathrm{VaR}(1\%, \text {normal}) = \mathrm{Mean} - 2.33\mathrm{SD}
$$

When returns are not normal, the VaR conveys important additional information beyond mean and standard deviation about exposure to severe losses. Faced with a distribution of actual returns that may not be normally distributed, we must estimate the VaR directly. To do so, we sort the observations from high to low. The VaR is the return at the 1st percentile of the sample distribution.

# Expected Shortfall

When we assess tail risk by looking at the  $1\%$  worst-case scenarios, the VaR is the most optimistic measure of bad-case outcomes as it takes the highest return (smallest loss) of all these cases. In other words, it tells you the investment loss at the first percentile of the return distribution, but it ignores the magnitudes of potential losses even further out in the tail. A more informative view of downside exposure would focus instead on the expected loss given that we find ourselves in one of the worst-case scenarios. This value, unfortunately, has two names: either expected shortfall (ES) or conditional tail expectation (CTE); the latter emphasizes that this expectation is conditioned on being in the left tail of the distribution. ES is the more commonly used terminology. Using a sample of historical returns, we would estimate the  $1\%$  expected shortfall by identifying the worst  $1\%$  of all observations and taking their average. $^7$

# Lower Partial Standard Deviation and the Sortino Ratio

The use of standard deviation as a measure of risk when the return distribution is nonnormal presents two problems: (1) The asymmetry of the distribution suggests we should look at negative outcomes separately and (2) because an alternative to a risky portfolio is a risk-free investment, we should look at deviations of returns from the risk-free rate rather than from the sample average, that is, at negative excess returns.

A risk measure that addresses these issues is the lower partial standard deviation (LPSD) of excess returns, which is computed like the usual standard deviation, but using only "bad" returns. Specifically, it uses only negative deviations from the risk-free rate

(rather than negative deviations from the sample average), squares those deviations to obtain an analog to variance, and then takes the square root to obtain a "left-tail standard deviation." The LPSD is therefore the square root of the average squared deviation, conditional on a negative excess return. Notice that this measure ignores the frequency of negative excess returns; that is, portfolios with the same average squared negative excess returns will yield the same LPSD regardless of the relative frequency of negative excess returns.

Practitioners who replace standard deviation with this LPSD typically also replace the Sharpe ratio (the ratio of average excess return to standard deviation) with the ratio of average excess returns to LPSD. This variant on the Sharpe ratio is called the Sortino ratio.

# Relative Frequency of Large, Negative 3-Sigma Returns

Here we concentrate on the relative frequency of large, negative returns compared with those frequencies in a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation. Extreme returns are often called jumps, as the stock price makes a big sudden movement. We compare the fraction of observations with returns 3 or more standard deviations below the mean to the relative frequency of negative 3-sigma returns in the corresponding normal distribution.

This measure can be quite informative about downside risk but, in practice, is most useful for large samples observed at a high frequency. Observe from Figure 5.4 that the relative frequency of returns that are 3 standard deviations or more below the mean in a standard normal distribution is only  $0.13\%$ , that is, 1.3 observations per 1,000. Thus, these returns are rare, but when they occur, they have a large impact on investment performance.

# 5.6 Learning from Historical Returns

# Time Series versus Scenario Analysis

In a forward-looking scenario analysis, we specify a set of relevant scenarios and associated rates of return, assign probabilities to each, and conclude by computing the risk premium (expected reward) and standard deviation (risk) of an investment. In contrast, asset return histories come in the form of time series of actual returns that do not necessarily match investors' original assessments of the probabilities of those returns. We can at most infer the probability distributions from which these returns might have been drawn or, at least, the expected return and standard deviation.

# Expected Returns and the Arithmetic Average

When we use historical data, we treat each observation as an equally likely "scenario." So if there are  $n$  observations, we substitute equal probabilities of  $1/n$  for each  $p(s)$  in Equation 5.11. The expected return,  $E(r)$ , is then estimated by the arithmetic average of the sample rates of return:

$$
E (r) = \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {n} p (s) r (s) = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {n} r (s) \tag {5.16}
$$

= Arithmetic average of historic rates of return

# Example 5.6 Arithmetic Average and Expected Return

Spreadsheet 5.2 presents a (very short) time series of holding-period returns for a hypothetical portfolio over a 5-year period. We treat each HPR of the  $n = 5$  observations in the time series as an equally likely annual outcome during the sample years and assign it an equal probability of 1/5, or .2. (See Column B.) Column C shows the annual HPRs. Applying Equation 5.16 (using Excel's SUMPRODUCT function) to the time series in Spreadsheet 5.2 demonstrates that adding up the products of probability times HPR amounts to taking the arithmetic average of the HPRs (compare cells C7 and C8).

Example 5.6 illustrates the logic for the wide use of the arithmetic average in investments. If the time series of historical returns fairly represents the true underlying probability distribution, then the arithmetic average return from a historical period provides a reasonable forecast of the investment's expected future HPR.

# The Geometric (Time-Weighted) Average Return

The arithmetic average provides an unbiased estimate of the expected future return. But what does the time series tell us about the actual performance of a portfolio over the past sample period? Let's continue Example 5.6 using its very short sample period just to illustrate.

Column F in Spreadsheet 5.2 shows the investor's "wealth index" from investing  $1 in the portfolio at the beginning of the first year. Wealth in each year increases by the "gross return," that is, by the multiple (1 + \mathrm{HPR})$ , shown in column E. The wealth index is the cumulative value of 1 invested at the beginning of the sample period. The value of the wealth index at the end of the fifth year, \$1.0275, is the terminal value of the \$1 investment, which implies a 5-year cumulative return of 2.75\%.

An intuitive measure of average performance over the sample period is the (fixed) annual HPR that would compound to the same terminal value resulting from the sequence

# Spreadsheet 5.2

Time series of holding-period returns of actual returns in the time series. This is called the geometric or compound rate of return. Denote the geometric rate by  $g$  so that


$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {T e r m i n a l} = (1 + r _ {1}) \times (1 + r _ {2}) \times \dots \times (1 + r _ {5}) = 1. 0 2 7 5 \\ (1 + g) ^ {n} = \text {T e r m i n a l v a l u e} = 1. 0 2 7 5 (\text {c e l l F 6 i n S p r e a d s h e e t 5 . 2}) \tag {5.17} \\ g = \text {Terminal value} ^ {1 / n} - 1 = 1.0275 ^ {1 / 5} - 1 = .0054 = .54 \% (\text {cell F14}) \\ \end{array}
$$

Practitioners often call  $g$  a time-weighted (as opposed to dollar-weighted) average return to emphasize that each past return receives an equal weight in the process of averaging. This distinction can be important because investment managers may experience significant changes in funds under management as investors purchase or redeem shares. Rates of return obtained during periods when the fund is large have a greater impact on final value than rates obtained when the fund is small. We discuss this distinction in Chapter 24 on portfolio performance evaluation.

Notice that the geometric average return in Spreadsheet 5.2,  $.54\%$ , is less than the arithmetic average,  $2.1\%$ . The greater the volatility in rates of return, the greater the difference between arithmetic and geometric averages. If returns come from a normal distribution, the expected difference is exactly half the variance of the distribution, that is,

$$
E [ \text {G e o m e t r i c a v e a r g e} ] = E [ \text {A r i t h m e t i c a v e a r g e} ] - 1 / 2 \sigma^ {2} \tag {5.18}
$$

(A warning: To use Equation 5.18, you must express returns as decimals, not percentages.) When returns are approximately normal, Equation 5.18 will be a good approximation. $^{8}$

The discrepancy between the geometric and arithmetic averages arises from the asymmetric effect of positive and negative rates of return on the terminal value of the portfolio. Example 5.7 illustrates this effect.

# Example 5.7 Geometric versus Arithmetic Average

Suppose you have a rate of return of  $-20\%$  in year 1 and  $20\%$  in year 2. The arithmetic average is 0. Yet each dollar invested for two years will grow to only  $0.80 \times 1.20 = \$ 96, less than the dollar you started with, implying a negative geometric average return. Your positive HPR in year 2 is applied to a smaller investment base than the negative HPR incurred in year 1. To break even after losing  $20\%$  in year 1, you would have needed a rate of return of  $25\%$  in year 2.

Now suppose that the order of the rates of return were switched, so that your HPRs were  $20\%$  in year 1 and  $-20\%$  in year 2. Again, your arithmetic average return is zero, but you still end up with only  $\$ .96$  ( $= 1.20 \times .80$ ). In this case, the loss in year 2 is applied to a bigger investment base than the gain in year 1, resulting in a larger dollar loss. In either case, the geometric average is less than the arithmetic one.

You invest 1 million at the beginning of 2028 in a stock-index fund. If the rate of return in 2028 is -40\%, what rate of return in 2029 will be necessary for your portfolio to recover to its original value?

# Estimating Variance and Standard Deviation

When thinking about risk, we are interested in the likelihood of deviations of actual outcomes from the expected return. Given a scenario analysis, we can define variance using squared deviations around the mean outcome, as in Equation 5.12. However, in practice, we rarely observe expectations directly, so we instead calculate variance by averaging squared deviations from our estimate of the expected return, the arithmetic average,  $\overline{r}$ . Adapting Equation 5.12 for historic data, we again use equal probabilities for each observation and use the sample average in place of the unobservable  $E(r)$ . Therefore, using historical data with  $n$  observations, we estimate variance as

$$
\hat {\sigma} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {n} [ r (s) - \bar {r} ] ^ {2} \tag {5.19}
$$ where  $\hat{\sigma}$  replaces  $\sigma$  to denote that it is an estimate.


# Example 5.8 Variance and Standard Deviation

Take another look at Spreadsheet 5.2. Column D shows the squared deviation from the arithmetic average, and cell D9 gives the variance as .0315. This is the sum of the product of the probability of each outcome  $(1/n = .20)$  times the squared deviation of that outcome. Finally, the standard deviation given in cell D10, .1774, is the square root of the variance.

The variance estimate from Equation 5.19 is biased downward, however. The reason is that we have taken deviations from the sample arithmetic average,  $\overline{r}$ , instead of the unknown, true expected value,  $E(r)$ , and so have introduced a bit of estimation error. Its effect on the estimated variance is sometimes called a degrees of freedom bias. We can eliminate the bias by multiplying the arithmetic average of squared deviations by the factor  $n / (n - 1)$ . The variance and standard deviation then become

$$
\hat {\sigma} ^ {2} = \left(\frac {n}{n - 1}\right) \times \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {n} [ r (s) - \bar {r} ] ^ {2} = \frac {1}{n - 1} \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {n} [ r (s) - \bar {r} ] ^ {2} \tag {5.20}
$$

$$
\hat {\sigma} = \sqrt {\frac {1}{n - 1} \sum_ {s = 1} ^ {n} [ r (s) - \bar {r} ] ^ {2}}
$$

Cell D13 shows the unbiased estimate of standard deviation, .1983, which is higher than the .1774 value obtained in cell D11. In Excel, the function STDEV.P calculates standard deviation without any correction for degrees of freedom (consistent with Equation 5.19) while the function STDEV.S applies the correction (consistent with Equation 5.20). For large samples, the distinction is usually not important:  $n / (n - 1)$  is close to 1, and the adjustment for degrees of freedom becomes trivially small.

# Mean and Standard Deviation Estimates from Higher-Frequency Observations

Do more frequent observations lead to more accurate estimates? The answer to this question is surprising: Observation frequency has no impact on the accuracy of estimates of expected return. It is the duration of a sample time series (as opposed to the number of observations) that improves accuracy.

Ten annual returns provide as accurate an estimate of the expected rate of return as 120 monthly returns. Because the average monthly return must be consistent with the average annual returns, the additional intra-year observations provide no additional information about mean return. A longer sample, for example, a 100-year return, does provide a more accurate estimate of the mean return than a 10-year return, provided the probability distribution of returns remains unchanged over the 100 years. This suggests a rule: Use the longest sample that you still believe comes from the same return distribution. Unfortunately, in practice, old data may be less informative. Are return data from the 19th century relevant to estimating expected returns in the 21st century? Quite possibly not, implying that we face severe limits to the accuracy of our estimates of mean returns.

In contrast to the mean, the accuracy of estimates of the standard deviation can be made more precise by increasing the number of observations. This is because the more frequent observations give us more information about the distribution of deviations from the average. Thus, we can improve the accuracy of estimates of SD by using more frequent observations.

Estimates of standard deviation begin with the variance. When monthly returns are uncorrelated from one month to another, monthly variances simply add up. Thus, when the variance is the same every month, the variance of annual returns is 12 times the variance of monthly returns: $^9$ $\sigma_A^2 = 12\sigma_M^2$ . In general, the  $T$ -month variance is  $T$  times the 1-month variance. Consequently, standard deviation grows at the rate of  $\sqrt{T}$ ; for example, the standard deviation of annual returns is related to the standard deviation of monthly returns by  $\sigma_A = \sqrt{12}\sigma_M$ . While the mean and variance grow in direct proportion to time, SD grows at the rate of square root of time.

# 5.7 Historic Returns on Risky Portfolios

We can now apply the analytical tools worked out in previous sections to look at the historic performance of several important portfolios.

We begin by comparing the performance of Treasury bills, Treasury bonds, and a diversified portfolio of U.S. stocks. T-bills are widely considered the least risky of all assets. There is essentially no risk that the U.S. government will fail to honor its commitments to these investors, and their short maturities mean that their prices are relatively stable. Long-term U.S. Treasury bonds are also certain to be repaid, but the prices of these bonds fluctuate as interest rates vary, so they impose meaningful risk. Finally, common stocks are the riskiest of the three groups of securities. As a part-owner of the corporation, your return will depend on the success or failure of the firm.

Our benchmark stock portfolio is the broadest possible U.S. equity portfolio, including all stocks listed on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ. We shall denote it as "the

U.S. market index." Because larger firms play a greater role in the economy, this index is a value-weighted portfolio and therefore dominated by the large-firm corporate sector. The data series include returns on these stocks from 1927 to 2021, a sample period spanning 95 years.

Figure 5.7 is a frequency distribution of annual returns on these three portfolios. The greater volatility of stock returns compared to T-bill or T-bond returns is immediately apparent. Compared to stock returns, the distribution of T-bond returns is far more concentrated in the middle of the distribution, with far fewer outliers. The distribution of T-bill returns is even tighter. More to the point, the spread of the T-bill distribution does not reflect risk but rather changes in the risk-free rate over time.[10] Anyone buying a T-bill knows exactly what the (nominal) return will be when the bill matures, so variation in the return is not a reflection of risk over that short holding period.

While the frequency distribution is a handy visual representation of investment risk, we also need a way to quantify that volatility; this is provided by the standard deviation of returns. Table 5.4 shows that the standard deviation of the return on stocks over this period,  $19.89\%$ , was nearly double that of T-bonds,  $11.58\%$ , and more than 6 times that of T-bills. Of course, that greater risk brought with it greater reward. The excess return on stocks (i.e., the return in excess of the T-bill rate) averaged  $8.87\%$  per year, providing a generous risk premium to equity investors.

Table 5.4 uses a fairly long sample period to estimate the average level of risk and reward. While averages may well be useful indications of what we might expect going forward, we nevertheless should expect both risk and expected return to fluctuate over time. Figure 5.8 plots the "moving" standard deviation of the market's excess return. Each standard deviation is calculated from the 12 most recent monthly returns. Each month, a new observation is added and the oldest one is dropped. While market risk clearly ebbs and flows, aside from its abnormally high values during the Great Depression, there does not seem to be any obvious trend in its level. This gives us more confidence that historical risk estimates provide useful guidance about the future.

Of course, as we emphasized in the previous sections, unless returns are normally distributed, standard deviation is not sufficient to measure risk. We also need to think about "tail risk," that is, our exposure to unlikely but very large outcomes in the left tail of the probability distributions. Figure 5.9 provides some evidence of this exposure. It shows a frequency distribution of monthly excess returns on the market index since 1927. The solid bars show the historical frequency of excess returns falling within each range, while the pattern bars show the frequencies that we would observe if these returns followed a normal distribution with the same mean and variance as the actual empirical distribution. You can see here some evidence of a fat-tailed distribution: The actual frequencies of extreme returns, both high and low, are higher than would be predicted by the normal distribution.

You might wonder about the negative T-bill rates that show up in the frequency distribution in Figure 5.7. T-bills did not make their debut until the 1940s. For earlier dates, commercial paper is used as the closest approximation to short-term risk-free rates. In a few instances, they were issued slightly above par and thus yielded slightly negative rates.

Further evidence on the distribution of excess equity returns is given in Table 5.5. Here, we use monthly data on both the market index and, for comparison, several "style" portfolios. You may remember from Chapter 4, Figure 4.5, that the performance of mutual funds is commonly evaluated relative to other funds with similar investment "styles." (See the Morningstar style box in Figure 4.5.) Style is usually defined along two dimensions: size (do the funds invest in large cap or small cap firms?) and value versus growth. Firms with high ratios of market value to book value are viewed as "growth firms" because, to justify their high prices relative to current book values, the market must anticipate rapid growth.

The use of style portfolios as benchmarks for performance evaluation traces back to influential papers by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, who extensively documented that firm size and the book value-to-market value ratio predict average returns; these patterns have since been corroborated in stock exchanges around the world.11 A high book-to-market (B/M) ratio is interpreted as an indication that the value of the firm is driven primarily by assets already in place, rather than the prospect of high future growth. These are called "value" firms. In contrast, a low book-to-market ratio is typical of firms

# Table 5.5

Statistics for monthly excess returns on the market index and four "style" portfolios whose market value derives mostly from ample growth opportunities. Realized average returns have been higher for value firms than for growth firms and for small firms than for large ones. The Fama-French database includes returns on portfolios of U.S. stocks sorted by size (Big; Small) and by B/M ratios (High; Medium; Low).

Source: Authors' calculations using data from Prof. Kenneth French's Web site: http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data.library.html.


Following the Fama-French classifications, we drop the medium B/M portfolios and identify firms ranked in the top  $30\%$  of B/M ratio as "value firms" and firms ranked in the bottom  $30\%$  as "growth firms." We split firms into above and below median levels of market capitalization to establish subsamples of small versus large firms. We thus obtain four comparison portfolios: Big/Growth, Big/Value, Small/Growth, and Small/Value.

Table 5.5, Panel A, presents results using monthly data for the full sample period, 1927-2021. The top two lines show the annualized average excess return and standard deviation of each portfolio. The broad market index outperformed T-bills by an average of  $8.86\%$  per year, $^{13}$  with a standard deviation of  $18.52\%$ , resulting in a Sharpe ratio (third line) of  $8.86 / 18.52 = .48$ . In line with the Fama-French analysis, small/value firms had the highest average excess return and the best risk-return trade-off with a Sharpe ratio of .55. However, Figure 5.7 warns us that actual returns may have fatter tails than the normal distribution, so we need to consider risk measures beyond just the standard deviation. The table therefore also presents several measures of risk that are suited for non-normal distributions.

Several of these other measures actually do not show meaningful departures from the symmetric normal distribution. Skew is generally near zero; if downside risk were substantially greater than upside potential, we would expect skew to be generally negative, which it is not. Along the same lines, the lower partial standard deviation is generally quite close to the conventional standard deviation. Finally, while the actual  $1\%$  VaR of these portfolios are uniformly higher than the  $1\%$  VaR that would be predicted from normal distributions with matched means and standard deviations, the differences between the empirical and predicted VaR statistics are not large. By this metric as well, the normal appears to be a decent approximation to the actual return distribution.

However, there is other evidence suggesting fat tails in the return distributions of these portfolios. To begin, note that kurtosis (the measure of the "fatness" of both tails of the distribution) is uniformly high. Investors are, of course, concerned with the lower (left) tail of the distribution; they do not lose sleep over their exposure to extreme good returns! Unfortunately, these portfolios suggest that the left tail of the return distribution is overrepresented compared to the normal. If excess returns were normally distributed, then only  $.13\%$  of them would fall more than 3 standard deviations below the mean. In fact, the actual incidence of excess returns below that cutoff are several multiples of  $.13\%$  for each portfolio.

The expected shortfall (ES) estimates show why VaR is only an incomplete measure of downside risk. ES in Table 5.5 is the average excess return of those observations that fall in the extreme left tail, specifically, those that fall below the  $1\%$  VaR. By definition, this value must be worse than the VaR, as it averages among all the returns that are below the  $1\%$  cutoff. Because it uses the actual returns of the "worst-case outcomes," ES is by far a better indicator of exposure to extreme events.

Figure 5.2 showed us that the post-war years (more accurately, the years after 1951) have been far more predictable, at least with respect to inflation and interest rates. This suggests that it may be instructive to examine stock returns in the post-1951 period as well to see if risk and return characteristics for equity investments have changed meaningfully in the more recent period. The relevant statistics are given in Panel B of Table 5.5. Perhaps not surprisingly in light of the history of inflation and interest rates, the more recent period is in fact less risky. Standard deviation for all five portfolios is noticeably lower in recent years, and kurtosis, our measure of fat tails, drops dramatically. VaR also falls. While the number of excess returns that are more than 3 SD below the mean changes inconsistently, because SD is lower in this period, those negative returns are also less dramatic: Expected shortfall is lower in the latter period.

To summarize, the frequency distributions in Figure 5.9 and the statistics in Table 5.5 for the market index as well as the style portfolios tell a reasonably consistent story. There is some, admittedly inconsistent, evidence of fat tails, so investors should not take normality for granted. On the other hand, extreme returns are in fact quite uncommon, especially in more recent years. The incidence of returns on the market index in the post-1951 period that are worse than 3 SD below the mean is .71\%, compared to a prediction of .13\% for the normal distribution. The "excess" rate of extreme bad outcomes is thus only .58\%, or about once in 172 months (14.4 years). So it is not unreasonable to accept the simplification offered by normality as an acceptable approximation as we think about constructing and evaluating our portfolios.

# A Global View of the Historical Record

How representative is U.S. history for the risk-return trade-off around the world? Returns in the U.S. in the last century were excellent in comparison to other countries.[14] In the 1900-2020 period, U.S. stocks outperformed bills by  $7.7\%$  per year versus average outperformance of only  $5.3\%$  outside the U.S.[15] On the other hand, Panel A of Figure 5.10 shows that several countries outperformed the United States, so by that standard, the U.S. was not exceptional.

The United States was more impressive in the reward it offered per unit of risk—that is, in its Sharpe ratio. We see in Panel B that the trade-off it offered investors was second only to Australia's. The Sharpe ratio in the U.S. was .40, versus an average non-U.S. ratio of only .29 (see World ex-U.S.). This reward for bearing risk was in fact exceptional.

These results—both its above-average risk premium and, more dramatically, its outstanding Sharpe ratio—raise the question of whether U.S. stock market performance turned out to be better than investors initially anticipated. When we use historical-average excess returns as estimates of risk premia or use historical Sharpe ratios as estimates of the reward investors demanded per unit of risk, we are implicitly treating those historical outcomes as unbiased estimators of investors' expectations. But when we see that the United States actually fared so much better than the rest of the world, we need to ask whether its historical experience was representative of the actual probability distribution that investors envisioned.

Few could have predicted in the early 20th century that the U.S. economy would be as successful as it turned out to be. The surprisingly rapid growth in that century of its real economy mirrors the performance of its financial sector. And the extent of the success of its tech sector (e.g., Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and so on) in the 21st century, which had a major impact on stock index returns in this more recent period, was also probably largely unanticipated two decades ago.

Given this evidence of better-than-expected performance in the U.S. over the last century, we may wish to trim the average excess return in Table 5.4 when we estimate the equity risk premium. Corroborating this view, surveys of businesspeople as well as academics also commonly suggest that the expected risk premium is lower than suggested by historical performance.[16]

International comparisons for a wide range of countries going back for more than a century appear in Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton, *Triumph of the Optimists*, (Princeton University Press, 2002, updated in *Global Investment Returns Yearbook*, Credit Suisse, 2021).

These excess returns are lower than those reported in Table 5.4. Much of the difference reflects a different sample period, which in this case begins in 1900 rather than 1927.

# 5.8 Normality and Long-Term Investments*

Figure 5.3 suggested that it may be reasonable to treat short-term (e.g., monthly) stock returns as approximately described by a symmetric normal distribution. But even if that is so, long-term performance cannot be normal. If  $r_1$  and  $r_2$  are the returns in two periods, and each has the same normal distribution, then the sum of the returns,  $r_1 + r_2$ , would be normal. But the two-period compound return is not the sum of the two returns. Instead, invested funds would compound to  $(1 + r_1)(1 + r_2)$ , which is not normal. This is more than a theoretical point. The shape of the distribution changes noticeably as the investment horizon extends.

To illustrate, suppose that you invest 100 in a stock with an expected monthly return of 1\%. But there is dispersion around the expected value: Suppose that with equal probability, the actual return in any month will exceed the mean by 2\% (for a return of 1\% + 2\% = 3\%), or fall short by 2\% (for a return of 1\% - 2\% = -1\%). These two possible monthly returns, -1\% or 3\%, are thus symmetrically distributed around the 1\% mean. Now let's look at the distribution of the portfolio value at the end of several investment horizons. Figure 5.11 shows the results.

After 6 months (Panel A), the distribution of possible values is beginning to take on the shape of the familiar bell-shaped curve. Mid-range values are more likely because there are more paths that take us to these outcomes. (To get into either tail of the distribution would require extreme, and therefore unlikely, good or bad luck, with an unlikely preponderance of either positive or negative outcomes.) After 20 months (Panel B), the bell-shaped distribution is even more obvious, but there is already a hint that extremely good cumulative returns (with possible stock prices extending to  \$180 for a cumulative gain of 80\%$ ) are more prevalent than extremely poor ones (notice that the worst possible outcome is 82, implying a total loss of only  $18\%$ ). After 40 months (Panel C), the asymmetry in the distribution is pronounced.

This pattern emerges because of compounding. The upside potential of the investment is unlimited. But no matter how many months in a row you lose  $1\%$ , your funds cannot drop below zero, so there is a floor on worst-possible performance: You can't lose more than  $100\%$  of your investment. After 40 months, the best possible stock value is  $\$100 \times 1.03^{40} = \$326$ , for a total gain of  $226\%$ , but the worst possible outcome is  $\$100 \times .99^{40} = \$66.90$ , for a cumulative loss of  $33.1\%$ .

While the probability distribution in Figure 5.11, Panel C is bell-shaped, it is a distinctly "asymmetric bell" with a positive skew, and the distribution is clearly not normal. In fact, the actual distribution approaches the lognormal distribution. "Lognormal" means that the log of the final portfolio value,  $\ln (W_T)$ , is normally distributed.

Does this result invalidate the simplifying assumption of normally distributed returns? Fortunately, there is a simple fix to this conundrum. Instead of using effective annual returns, we can use continuously compounded returns.

If the continuously compounded returns in two months are  $r_{cc}(1)$  and  $r_{cc}(2)$ , then invested funds grow by a factor of  $\exp [r_{cc}(1)]$  in the first month and  $\exp [r_{cc}(2)]$  in the second month, where  $\exp (\cdot)$  is the exponential function. The total growth in the investment is thus  $\exp [r_{cc}(1)] \times \exp [r_{cc}(2)] = \exp [r_{cc}(1) + r_{cc}(2)]$ . In other words, the total two-month return expressed as a continuously compounded rate is the sum of the one-month returns.

Panel C: 40 months
Figure 5.11 Frequency distribution of final portfolio value after different number of months. Initial investment = 100. In any month, portfolio value will increase by 3\% or fall by 1\% with equal probability.

Therefore, if the monthly returns are normal, then the multi-month returns will also be normal. $^{17}$  Thus, by using continuously compounded rates, even long-term returns can be described by the normal distribution. Moreover, if returns have the same distribution in each month, then the expected two-month return is just twice the expected one-month return, and if returns over time are uncorrelated, then the variance of the two-month return is also twice that of the one-month return. $^{18}$

We can generalize from this example to arbitrary investment horizons, which we will call  $T$ . If the expected per-period continuously compounded return is called  $E(r_{cc})$ , then the expected cumulative return after an investment of  $T$  periods is  $E(r_{cc})T$ , and the expected final value of the portfolio is  $E(W_T) = W_0\exp [E(r_{cc})T]$ . The variance of the cumulative return is also proportional to the time horizon:  $\mathrm{Var}(r_{cc}T) = T\mathrm{Var}(r_{cc})$ . Therefore, the standard deviation grows in proportion to the square root of the time horizon:

$$
S D \left(r _ {c c} T\right) = \sqrt {T \operatorname {V a r} \left(r _ {c c}\right)} = \sigma \sqrt {T}
$$

# Short-Run versus Long-Run Risk

Our results on the risk and return of investments over different time horizons appear to offer a mitigation of investment risk in the long run: Because expected return increases with horizon in proportion to  $T$ , while standard deviation increases in proportion to the square root of  $T$ , the expected return of a long-term risky investment becomes ever larger relative to its standard deviation. Does this mean that investments are less risky when horizons are longer? To see why many people believe so, consider the following example.

# Example 5.9 Investment Risk in the Short Run and the Long Run

Suppose that investment returns are independent from year to year with an expected continuously compounded rate of return of .05 and a standard deviation of  $\sigma = .30$ . Let's look at the properties of the investment at horizons of 1, 10, and 30 years. These are laid out in Table 5.6. The mean average annual return is  $5\%$  regardless of the horizon, but the mean cumulative return rises in direct proportion to  $T$ . The standard deviation of the cumulative return rises in proportion to the square root of  $T$ .

Next, we look at the probability that the cumulative return will be negative, in other words, that the investor will suffer a loss. For the 1-year investor to suffer a loss, the actual return must be .05 below the mean. This implies a return that is .05/.3 = .167 standard deviation below the mean return. Assuming normality, the probability of such an outcome is .434. (See Example 5.8 for an example of how to compute this probability.) For the 10-year investor, the mean cumulative continuously compounded return is .500 and the standard deviation is .949. Therefore, the investor will suffer losses only if the actual 10-year return is .500/.949 = .527 standard deviation below the expected value. The probability of this outcome is only .299. The probability of a loss after 30 years is even lower, .181. As the horizon expands, mean return increases faster than standard deviation and therefore the probability of a loss steadily shrinks.

By the way, notice that if we take the log of the cumulative return, we get  $\ln [\exp [r_{cc}(1) + r_{cc}(2)] = r_{cc}(1) + r_{cc}(2)$ , which is normally distributed. So if the continuously compounded return is normally distributed, the final value of the portfolio will be lognormally distributed.
18A warning: The variance of the effective annual return is not exactly equal to that of the continuously compounded return. If  $\sigma^2$  is the variance of the continuously compounded return and  $\mu$  is its mean, then the variance of the effective annual rate when returns are lognormally distributed is:

$$
\operatorname {V a r} (r) = \exp [ 2 (\mu + \frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {2}) ] \times [ \exp (\sigma^ {2}) - 1 ]
$$

A warning: Example 5.9 is misleading in an important respect. The probability of a shortfall is an incomplete measure of investment risk. This probability does not take into account the size of potential losses, which, for some of the possible outcomes (however unlikely they may be), amount to near ruin. The worst-case scenarios for the 30-year investment are far worse than for the 1-year investment. We can see this point vividly by comparing the VaR of the investment at different horizons.

Table 5.6 shows that the  $1\%$  VaR after one year entails a continuously compounded cumulative loss of .648, implying that each dollar invested will fall almost in half, specifically to  $e^{-.648} = .523$ . This value is called the "wealth relative" of the investment (i.e., it is the final value of the portfolio as a fraction of initially invested funds). The  $1\%$  VaR after 30 years is far worse: It implies a wealth relative of .098, less than one-fifth the value of the 1-year VaR. Thus, while the probability of losses falls as the investment horizon lengthens, the magnitude of potential losses grows. The comparison is even more extreme when we look at the  $0.1\%$  VaR.

Despite this, many observers maintain the view that investment risk is less pertinent to long-term investors. A typical demonstration relies on the fact that the standard deviation (or range of likely outcomes) of annualized returns is lower for longer-term horizons. But that argument is silent on the range of total returns.

# Forecasts for the Long Haul

We use arithmetic averages to forecast future rates of return because they are unbiased estimates of expected rates over equivalent holding periods. But the arithmetic average of short-term returns can be misleading when used to forecast long-term cumulative returns. This is because sampling errors in the estimate of expected return will have asymmetric impact when compounded over long periods. Positive sampling variation will compound to greater upward errors than negative variation.

Jacquier, Kane, and Marcus show that an unbiased forecast of total return over long horizons requires compounding at a weighted average of the arithmetic and geometric historical averages.[19] The proper weight applied to the geometric average equals the ratio of the length of the forecast horizon to the length of the estimation period. For example, if

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="3">Investment Horizon</td><td rowspan="2">Comment</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Mean total return</td><td>0.050</td><td>0.500</td><td>1.500</td><td>= 0.05*T</td></tr><tr><td>Mean average return</td><td>0.050</td><td>0.050</td><td>0.050</td><td>= 0.05</td></tr><tr><td>Std dev total return</td><td>0.300</td><td>0.949</td><td>1.643</td><td>= 0.30*√T</td></tr><tr><td>Probability return &lt; 0</td><td>0.434</td><td>0.299</td><td>0.181</td><td>assuming normal distribution</td></tr><tr><td>1\% VaR total return</td><td>-0.648</td><td>-1.707</td><td>-2.323</td><td>continuously compounded return</td></tr><tr><td>Implies final wealth relative of:</td><td>0.523</td><td>0.181</td><td>0.098</td><td>= exp(VaR total return)</td></tr><tr><td>0.1\% VaR total return</td><td>-0.877</td><td>-2.432</td><td>-3.578</td><td>continuously compounded return</td></tr><tr><td>Implies final wealth relative of:</td><td>0.416</td><td>0.088</td><td>0.028</td><td>= exp(VaR total return)</td></tr></table>

Table 5.6

Investment risk at different horizons we wish to forecast the cumulative return for a 25-year horizon from a 90-year history, an unbiased estimate would be to compound at a rate of


$$
\text {G e o m e t r i c a v e r a g e} \times \frac {2 5}{9 0} + \text {A r i t h m e t i c a v e r a g e} \times \frac {(9 0 - 2 5)}{9 0}
$$

This correction would take about  $5\%$  off the historical arithmetic average risk premium on large stocks and almost  $2\%$  off the arithmetic average premium of small stocks. A forecast for the next 90 years would require compounding at only the geometric average, and for longer horizons at an even lower number. The forecast horizons that are relevant for current investors therefore depend on their investment horizons.

# SUMMARY

1. The economy's equilibrium level of real interest rates depends on the willingness of households to save, as reflected in the supply curve of funds, and on the expected profitability of business investment in plant, equipment, and inventories, as reflected in the demand curve for funds. It depends also on government fiscal and monetary policy.
2. The nominal rate of interest is the equilibrium real rate plus the expected rate of inflation. In general, we can directly observe only nominal interest rates; from them, we must infer expected real rates, using inflation forecasts. Assets with guaranteed nominal interest rates are risky in real terms because the future inflation rate is uncertain.
3. The equilibrium expected rate of return on any security is the sum of the equilibrium real rate of interest, the expected rate of inflation, and a security-specific risk premium.
4. Investors face a trade-off between risk and expected return. Historical data confirm our intuition that assets with low degrees of risk should provide lower returns on average than do those of higher risk.
5. Historical rates of return over the last century in other countries suggest the U.S. history of stock returns may be a positive outlier compared to other countries. This would suggest that its historical experience may overstate realistic projections for future performance as well as the risk premium demanded by stock market investors.
6. Historical returns on stocks exhibit somewhat more frequent large deviations from the mean than would be predicted from a normal distribution. However, the discrepancies from the normal distribution tend to be minor and inconsistent across various measures of tail risk, and have declined in recent years. The lower partial standard deviation (LPSD), skew, and kurtosis of the actual distribution quantify the deviation from normality.
7. Widely used measures of tail risk are value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall or, equivalently, conditional tail expectation. VaR measures the loss that will be exceeded with a specified probability such as  $1\%$  or  $5\%$ . Expected shortfall (ES) measures the expected rate of return conditional on the portfolio falling below a certain value. Thus,  $1\%$  ES is the expected value of the outcomes that lie in the bottom  $1\%$  of the distribution.
8. Investments in risky portfolios do not become safer in the long run. On the contrary, the longer a risky investment is held, the greater the risk. The basis of the argument that stocks are safe in the long run is the fact that the probability of an investment shortfall becomes smaller. However, probability of shortfall is an incomplete measure of the safety of an investment because it ignores the magnitude of possible losses.

1. The Fisher equation tells us that the real interest rate approximately equals the nominal rate minus the inflation rate. Suppose the inflation rate increases from  $3\%$  to  $5\%$ . Does the Fisher equation imply that this increase will result in a fall in the real rate of interest? Explain.

# Capital Allocation to Risky Assets

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/ce8738598267e7912abbacfa97244ce73e4278f8a22cdbd73a76cb3238095355.jpg)

PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION IS commonly—and very properly—viewed as comprising two broad tasks: (1) the allocation of the overall portfolio to safe assets such as a money market account or Treasury bills versus to risky assets such as shares of stock and (2) the determination of the composition of the risky portion of the complete portfolio. The first step, in which you determine the proportion of your overall portfolio to devote to risky versus risk-free assets, is called the capital allocation decision, and that is where we will begin our tour of what is known as portfolio theory.

Of course, one cannot rationally make a capital allocation decision without knowing the properties of the risky portfolio, specifically its risk premium and volatility, but we will start by assuming that investors have identified acceptable candidate risky portfolios and have a sense of their properties. For now, you can think of that risky portfolio as one that might be offered by a mutual fund company, or, even better, as a stock market index fund. We will devote a lot of attention in the next two chapters to how such portfolios might be constructed.


The optimal capital allocation will depend in part on the risk-return trade-off offered by the risky portfolio. But it will also depend on the investor's attitude toward risk, so we need a way to measure and describe risk aversion. Therefore, we will show how risk aversion can be characterized by a "utility function" that investors can use to rank portfolios with different expected returns and levels of risk. By choosing the overall portfolio with the highest utility score, investors optimize their trade-off between risk and return; that is, they achieve the optimal allocation of capital to risky versus risk-free assets.

The utility model also reveals the appropriate objective function for the construction of an optimal risky portfolio, and thus explains how an investment management industry can construct portfolios that are acceptable to investors with highly diverse preferences without knowing each of them and, specifically, their tolerance for risk, personally.

# 6.1 Risk and Risk Aversion

In Chapter 5 we introduced the concepts of the holding-period return (HPR) and the excess rate of return over the risk-free rate. We also discussed estimation of the risk premium (the expected excess return) and the standard deviation of the excess return, which we use as the measure of portfolio risk. To clarify the role of the risk premium in the investment decision, we first differentiate between speculation and gambling.

# Risk, Speculation, and Gambling

One definition of speculation is "the assumption of considerable investment risk to obtain commensurate gain." By "considerable risk" we mean that the risk is sufficient to affect the decision. By "commensurate gain" we mean a positive risk premium, that is, an expected return greater than the risk-free alternative.

To gamble is "to bet or wager on an uncertain outcome." The central difference between gambling and speculation is the lack of "commensurate gain." A gamble is the assumption of risk for enjoyment of the risk itself, whereas speculation is undertaken in spite of the risk involved because one perceives a favorable risk-return trade-off. To turn a gamble into a speculative venture requires an adequate risk premium to compensate risk-averse investors for the risks they bear. Hence, risk aversion and speculation are consistent. Notice that a risky investment with a risk premium of zero, sometimes called a fair game, amounts to a gamble because there is no expected gain to compensate for the risk entailed. A risk-averse investor will reject gambles, but not necessarily speculative positions.

The important point is that even highly risky positions may be willingly assumed by risk-averse investors if they believe they are adequately compensated by the risk premium. We therefore should expect higher risk premiums to be associated with greater risk.

# Risk Aversion and Utility Values

Historical returns on various asset classes, analyzed in a mountain of empirical studies, leave no doubt that risky assets command a risk premium. This implies that most investors are risk averse.

Risk-averse investors reject portfolios that are fair games or worse. They consider only risk-free or speculative prospects with positive risk premiums. Loosely speaking, when evaluating the attractiveness of a prospective investment, a risk-averse investor "penalizes" the expected rate of return to account for the risk involved. The greater the risk, the larger the penalty. We believe that most investors would accept this view from simple introspection, but we discuss the question more fully in Appendix A of this chapter.

To illustrate the issues we confront when choosing among portfolios with varying degrees of risk, suppose the risk-free rate is  $2\%$  and that an investor is comparing the three alternative risky portfolios shown in Table 6.1. The risk premiums and standard deviations posited there might roughly approximate the properties of low-risk short-term bonds  $(L)$ , medium-risk long-term bonds  $(M)$ , and higher-risk large stocks  $(H)$ . Accordingly, these portfolios offer progressively higher risk premiums to compensate for greater risk. How might investors choose among them?

Intuitively, a portfolio is more attractive when its expected return is higher and its risk is lower. But when risk increases along with return, the most attractive portfolio is not obvious. How can we quantify the rate at which investors are willing to trade off return against risk?

<table><tr><td>Portfolio</td><td>Risk Premium</td><td>Expected Return</td><td>Risk (SD)</td></tr><tr><td>L (low risk)</td><td>2\%</td><td>4\%</td><td>5\%</td></tr><tr><td>M (medium risk)</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>H (high risk)</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>20</td></tr></table>

# Table 6.1

Available risky portfolios (risk-free rate  $= 2\%$ )

We will assume that each investor can assign a welfare, or utility, score to competing portfolios on the basis of expected return and risk. Higher utility values are assigned to portfolios with more attractive risk-return profiles. Portfolios receive higher utility scores for higher expected returns and lower scores for higher volatility. Many particular "scoring" systems are reasonable. One function that has been employed by both financial theorists and the CFA Institute assigns a portfolio with expected return  $E(r)$  and variance of returns  $\sigma^2$  the following utility score:

$$
U = E (r) - \frac {1}{2} A \sigma^ {2} \tag {6.1}
$$ where  $U$  is the utility value and  $A$  is an index of the investor's risk aversion. Equation 6.1 reflects the commonsense notion that utility increases with expected return but falls with volatility. $^{1}$  Notice that the portfolio in question here will potentially serve as the investor's overall or complete portfolio. Hence, assuming normality, standard deviation is the appropriate measure of risk.


Notice that risk-free portfolios (with variance  $= 0$ ) receive a utility score equal to their (known) rate of return because they receive no penalty for risk. The extent to which the variance of risky portfolios lowers utility depends on  $A$ , the investor's degree of risk aversion. More risk-averse investors (who have larger values of  $A$ ) penalize risky investments more severely. Investors choosing among competing portfolios will select the one providing the highest utility. The Words from the Street box later in this section discuss some techniques that financial advisers use to gauge the risk aversion of their clients.

# Example 6.1 Evaluating Investments by Using Utility Scores

Consider three investors with different degrees of risk aversion:  $A_{1} = 2$ ,  $A_{2} = 3.5$ , and  $A_{3} = 5$ , all of whom are evaluating the three portfolios in Table 6.1. Because the risk-free rate is assumed to be  $2\%$ , Equation 6.1 implies that all three investors would assign a utility score of .02 to the risk-free alternative. Table 6.2 presents the utility scores that would be assigned by each investor to each portfolio. The portfolio with the highest utility score for each investor appears as the bold entry in each row. Notice that the high-risk portfolio,  $H$ , would be chosen only by the investor with the lowest degree of risk aversion,  $A_{1} = 2$ , while the low-risk portfolio,  $L$ , would be passed over even by the most risk-averse of our three investors. All three portfolios would be preferred to the risk-free alternative by investors with levels of risk aversion given in the table.

We can interpret the utility score of risky portfolios as a certainty equivalent rate of return. The certainty equivalent is the rate that a risk-free investment would need to offer to provide the same utility as the risky portfolio. In other words, it is the rate that, if earned

The factor of  $\frac{1}{2}$  is just a commonly used scaling convention with no effect on how we characterize investors' preferences. To use Equation 6.1, rates of return must be expressed as decimals rather than percentages.

<table><tr><td>Investor Risk Aversion (A)</td><td>Utility Score of Portfolio L [E(r) = 0.04; σ = 0.05]</td><td>Utility Score of Portfolio M [E(r) = 0.06; σ = 0.10]</td><td>Utility Score of Portfolio H [E(r) = 0.10; σ = 0.20]</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>0.04 – 1⁄2 × 2 × 0.052 = 0.0375</td><td>0.06 – 1⁄2 × 2 × 0.12 = 0.0500</td><td>0.10 – 1⁄2 × 2 × 0.22 = 0.06</td></tr><tr><td>3.5</td><td>0.04 – 1⁄2 × 3.5 × 0.052 = 0.0356</td><td>0.06 – 1⁄2 × 3.5 × 0.12 = 0.0425</td><td>0.10 – 1⁄2 × 3.5 × 0.22 = 0.03</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>0.04 – 1⁄2 × 5 × 0.052 = 0.0338</td><td>0.06 – 1⁄2 × 5 × 0.12 = 0.0350</td><td>0.10 – 1⁄2 × 5 × 0.22 = 0.00</td></tr></table>

Table 6.2

Utility scores of alternative portfolios for investors with varying degrees of risk aversion with certainty, would provide a utility score equal to that of the portfolio in question. The certainty equivalent rate of return is a natural way to rank competing portfolios.


A portfolio is desirable only if its certainty equivalent return exceeds that of the risk-free alternative. If risk aversion is high enough, any risky portfolio, even one with a positive risk premium, will be assigned a certainty equivalent below the risk-free rate and will be rejected by the investor. At the same time, a less risk-averse investor may assign the same portfolio a certainty equivalent rate greater than the risk-free rate and thus will prefer it to the risk-free alternative. If the risk premium is zero or negative to begin with, any downward adjustment to utility only makes the portfolio look worse. Its certainty equivalent rate will be below that of the risk-free alternative for any risk-averse investor.

# Concept Check 6.1

A portfolio has an expected rate of return of  $15\%$  and standard deviation of  $30\%$ . T-bills offer a safe rate of return of  $2\%$ . Would an investor with risk-aversion parameter  $A = 4$  prefer to invest in T-bills or the risky portfolio? What if  $A = 2$ ?

In contrast to risk-averse investors, risk-neutral investors (with  $A = 0$ ) judge risky prospects solely by their expected rates of return. These investors impose no penalty for risk, so a portfolio's certainty equivalent rate is simply its expected rate of return.

A risk lover (for whom  $A < 0$ ) is happy to engage in fair games and gambles; this investor adjusts the expected return upward to take into account the "fun" of confronting the prospect's risk. Risk lovers will always take a fair game because their upward adjustment of utility for risk gives the fair game a certainty equivalent that exceeds the alternative of the risk-free investment.

We can depict the individual's trade-off between risk and return by plotting the characteristics of portfolios that would be equally attractive on a graph with axes measuring the expected value and standard deviation of portfolio returns. Figure 6.1 plots the characteristics of one portfolio, denoted  $P$ .

Portfolio  $P$ , which has expected return  $E(r_{P})$  and standard deviation  $\sigma_{P}$ , is preferred by risk-averse investors to any portfolio in quadrant IV because its expected return is equal to or greater than any portfolio in that quadrant and its standard deviation is equal to or less than any portfolio in that quadrant. Conversely, any portfolio in quadrant I dominates portfolio  $P$  because its expected return is equal to or greater than  $P$ 's and its standard deviation is equal to or less than  $P$ 's.

Figure 6.1 The trade-off between risk and return of a potential investment portfolio,  $P$

This is the mean-standard deviation, or, equivalently, the mean-variance (M-V) criterion. It can be stated as follows: portfolio  $A$  dominates  $B$  if

$$
E (r _ {A}) \geq E (r _ {B})
$$ and


$$
\sigma_ {A} \leq \sigma_ {B}
$$ and at least one inequality is strict (to rule out indifference between the two portfolios).


In the expected return-standard deviation plane in Figure 6.1, the preferred direction is northwest because in this direction we simultaneously increase the expected return and decrease the volatility of the rate of return. Any portfolio that lies northwest of  $P$  is superior to it.

What about portfolios in quadrants II and III? Their desirability, compared with  $P$ , depends on the investor's risk aversion. Suppose an investor identifies all portfolios that are equally attractive as portfolio  $P$ . Starting at  $P$ , an increase in standard deviation lowers utility; to compensate, expected return must be higher. Thus, point  $Q$  in Figure 6.2, with higher risk but higher expected return, is equally desirable to this investor as  $P$ . Equally preferred

Figure 6.2 The indifference curve

No risk, no reward. Most people intuitively understand that they have to bear some risk to achieve an acceptable return on their investment portfolios.

But how much risk is right for you? If your investments turn sour, you may put at jeopardy your ability to retire, to pay for your kid's college education, or to weather an unexpected need for cash. These worst-case scenarios focus our attention on how to manage our exposure to uncertainty.

Assessing—and quantifying—risk aversion is, to put it mildly, difficult. It requires confronting at least these two big questions.

First, how much investment risk can you afford to take? If you have a steady high-paying job, for example, you have greater ability to withstand investment losses. Conversely, if you are close to retirement, you have less ability to adjust your lifestyle in response to bad investment outcomes.

Second, you need to think about your personality and decide how much risk you can tolerate. At what point will you be unable to sleep at night?

To help clients quantify their risk aversion, many financial firms have designed quizzes to help people determine whether they are conservative, moderate, or aggressive investors. These quizzes try to get at clients' attitudes toward risk and their capacity to absorb investment losses.

Here is a sample of the sort of questions that can shed light on an investor's risk tolerance.

# MEASURING YOUR RISK TOLERANCE

Circle the letter that corresponds to your answer.

1. The stock market fell by more than  $30\%$  in 2008. If you had been holding a substantial stock investment in that year, which of the following would you have done?

a. Sold off the remainder of your investment before it had the chance to fall further.
b. Stayed the course with neither redemptions nor purchases.
c. Bought more stock, reasoning that the market is now cheaper and therefore offers better deals.

2. The value of one of the funds in your 401(k) plan (your primary source of retirement savings) increased  $30\%$  last year. What will you do?

a. Move your funds into a money market account in case the price gains reverse.
b. Sit tight and do nothing.
c. Put more of your assets into that fund, reasoning that its value is clearly trending upward.

3. How would you describe your non-investment sources of income (e.g., your salary)?

a. Highly uncertain b. Moderately stable
c. Highly stable

4. At the end of the month, you find yourself: a. Short of cash and impatiently waiting for your next paycheck.

b. Not overspending your salary, but not saving very much.
c. With a comfortable surplus of funds to put into your savings account.

5. You are 30 years old and enrolling in your company's retirement plan, and you need to allocate your contributions across 3 funds: a money market account, a bond fund, and a stock fund. Which of these allocations sounds best to you?

a. Invest everything in a safe money-market fund.
b. Split your money evenly between the bond fund and stock fund.
c. Put everything into the stock fund, reasoning that by the time you retire, the year-to-year fluctuations in stock, returns will have evened out.

6. You are a contestant on Let's Make a Deal, and have just won \$1,000. But you can exchange the winnings for two random payoffs. One is a coin flip with a payoff of \$2,500 if the coin comes up heads. The other is a flip of two coins with a payoff of 6,000 if both coins come up heads. What will you do?

a. Keep the 1,000 in cash.
b. Choose the single coin toss.
c. Choose the double coin toss.

7. Suppose you have the opportunity to invest in a start-up firm. If the firm is successful, you will multiply your investment by a factor of ten. But if it fails, you will lose everything. You think the odds of success are around  $20\%$ . How much would you be willing to invest in the start-up?

a. Nothing b. 2 months' salary
c. 6 months' salary

8. Now imagine that to buy into the start-up you will need to borrow money. Would you be willing to take out a 10,000 loan to make the investment?

a. No b. Maybe
c. Yes

# SCORING YOUR RISK TOLERANCE

For each question, give yourself one point if you answered (a), two points if you answered (b), and three points for a (c). The higher your total score, the greater is your risk tolerance, or, equivalently, the lower is your risk aversion.

<table><tr><td>Expected Return, E(r)</td><td>Standard Deviation, σ</td><td>Utility = E(r) - 1/2Aσ2</td></tr><tr><td>0.10</td><td>0.200</td><td>0.10 - 0.5 × 4 × 0.04 = 0.02</td></tr><tr><td>0.15</td><td>0.255</td><td>0.15 - 0.5 × 4 × 0.065 = 0.02</td></tr><tr><td>0.20</td><td>0.300</td><td>0.20 - 0.5 × 4 × 0.09 = 0.02</td></tr><tr><td>0.25</td><td>0.339</td><td>0.25 - 0.5 × 4 × 0.115 = 0.02</td></tr></table>

# Table 6.3

Utility values of possible portfolios for investor with risk aversion  $A = 4$ portfolios lie in the mean-standard deviation plane on a curve called the indifference curve, which connects all portfolio points with the same utility value (Figure 6.2).


To determine some of the points that appear on the indifference curve, examine the utility values of several possible portfolios for an investor with  $A = 4$ , presented in Table 6.3. Each portfolio offers identical utility because the portfolios with higher expected return also have higher risk (standard deviation).

# Concept Check 6.2 a. How will the indifference curve of a less risk-averse investor compare to the indifference curve drawn in Figure 6.2?

b. Draw both indifference curves passing through point  $P$ .

# Estimating Risk Aversion

How can we estimate the levels of risk aversion of individual investors? A number of methods may be used. The questionnaire in the nearby box is a simple example. More complex questionnaires, designed to pinpoint specific levels of risk aversion coefficients, ask would-be investors to choose from various sets of hypothetical risky prospects.

Access to the investment accounts of active investors would provide observations of how portfolio composition changes over time. Comparing estimates of the risk and return of these positions would, in principle, allow us to infer investors' risk aversion.

Finally, researchers track the behavior of groups of individuals to obtain average degrees of risk aversion. These studies range from observed purchase of insurance policies to labor supply and consumption behavior.

# 6.2 Capital Allocation across Risky and Risk-Free Portfolios

History shows us that long-term bonds have been riskier investments than Treasury bills and that stocks have been riskier still. On the other hand, the riskier investments have offered higher average returns. Investors, of course, do not make all-or-nothing choices from these investment classes. They can and do construct their portfolios using securities from all asset classes. Some of the portfolio may be in risk-free Treasury bills, some in high-risk stocks.

The most straightforward way to control the risk of the portfolio is through the fraction of the portfolio invested in Treasury bills or other safe money market securities versus the fraction invested in risky assets. Most investment professionals consider such broad asset allocation decisions the most important part of portfolio construction. Consider this statement by John Bogle, the late chairman of the Vanguard Group of Investment Companies:


The most fundamental decision of investing is the allocation of your assets: How much should you own in stock? How much should you own in bonds? How much should you own in cash reserves? . . . That decision [has been shown to account] for an astonishing  $94\%$  of the differences in total returns achieved by institutionally managed pension funds. . . . There is no reason to believe that the same relationship does not also hold true for individual investors. $^2$

Therefore, we start our discussion of the risk-return trade-off by examining the most basic asset allocation choice: How much of the portfolio should be placed in risk-free money market securities versus other risky asset classes.

We denote the investor's portfolio of risky assets as  $P$  and the risk-free asset as  $F$ . We assume for the sake of illustration that the risky component of the investor's overall portfolio comprises two mutual funds, one invested in stocks and the other in long-term bonds. For now, we take the composition of the risky portfolio as given and focus only on the allocation between it and risk-free securities. In the next chapter, we ask how best to determine the composition of the risky portfolio.

When we shift wealth from the risky portfolio to the risk-free asset, we do not change the relative proportions of the various risky assets within the risky portfolio. Rather, we reduce the relative weight of the risky portfolio as a whole in favor of risk-free assets.

For example, assume that the total market value of an initial portfolio is  \$300,000, of which\$ 90,000 is invested in the Ready Asset money market fund, a risk-free asset for practical purposes. The remaining  \$210,000 is invested in risky securities—\$ 113,400 in equities (E) and  $\$96,600$  in long-term bonds (B). The equities and bond holdings comprise “the” risky portfolio,  $54\%$  in E and  $46\%$  in B:

$$
E: \quad w _ {E} = \frac {1 1 3 , 4 0 0}{2 1 0 , 0 0 0} = . 5 4
$$

$$
B: \quad w _ {B} = \frac {9 6 , 6 0 0}{2 1 0 , 0 0 0} = . 4 6
$$

The weight of the risky portfolio,  $P$ , in the complete portfolio, comprising risk-free and risky investments, is denoted by  $y$ :

$$ y = \frac {2 1 0 , 0 0 0}{3 0 0 , 0 0 0} = . 7 (\text {r i s k y a s s e t s})
$$

$$
1 - y = \frac {9 0 , 0 0 0}{3 0 0 , 0 0 0} = . 3 (\text {r i s k - f r e e a s s e t s})
$$

Source: John C. Bogle, Bogle on Mutual Funds (Burr Ridge, IL: Irwin Professional Publishing, 1994), p. 235. Actually, this interpretation is a bit controversial. A more precise statement is that averaging across balanced funds that invest in both equity and fixed income securities, over  $90\%$  of the variation in returns over time, can be attributed to variation in the returns of the underlying asset classes. The portion of the variation in returns across managers for long (e.g., 10-year) holding periods that can be attributed to asset allocation policy is about  $40\%$ . Under either interpretation, asset allocation is clearly important. For more detail, see R. G. Ibbotson and P. D. Kaplan, "Does Asset Allocation Explain 40, 90, or 100 Percent of Performance?" Financial Analysts Journal, (January/February 2000), pp. 26-33.

The weights of each asset class in the complete portfolio are, therefore, as follows:

$$
E: \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 1 3 , 4 0 0}{\mathbb {S} 3 0 0 , 0 0 0} = . 3 7 8
$$

$$
B: \frac {\mathbb {S} 9 6 , 6 0 0}{\mathbb {S} 3 0 0 , 0 0 0} = . 3 2 2
$$

Risky portfolio  $= E + B = .700$

The risky portfolio makes up  $70\%$  of the complete portfolio.

# Example 6.2 The Risky Portfolio

Suppose the investor wishes to decrease risk by reducing the allocation to the risky portfolio from  $y = .7$  to  $y = .56$ . The risky portfolio would then total only  $.56 \times \300,000 = \$ 168,000 , requiring the sale of  $\42,000\$  of the original  $\$ 210,000  of risky holdings, with the proceeds used to purchase more shares in Ready Asset (the money market fund). Total holdings in the risk-free asset will increase to  $\300,000 \times (1 - .56) = \$ 132,000 , the original holdings plus the new contribution to the money market fund:

$$
\$ 90,000 + \$ 42,000 = \$ 132,000
$$

The key point is that the proportions of each asset in the risky portfolio remain unchanged. Because the weights of  $E$  and  $B$  in the risky portfolio are .54 and .46, respectively, we sell .54 × $42,000 = $22,680 of  $E$  and .46 × $42,000 = $19,320 of  $B$ . After the sale, the proportions of each asset in the risky portfolio are in fact unchanged:

$$
E: w _ {E} = \frac {1 1 3 , 4 0 0 - 2 2 , 6 8 0}{2 1 0 , 0 0 0 - 4 2 , 0 0 0} = . 5 4
$$

$$
B: \quad w _ {B} = \frac {9 6 , 6 0 0 - 1 9 , 3 2 0}{2 1 0 , 0 0 0 - 4 2 , 0 0 0} = . 4 6
$$

Therefore, rather than thinking of our risky holdings as  $E$  and  $B$  separately, it is better to view our holdings as if they were in a single fund that holds equities and bonds in fixed proportions. In this sense, we may treat the risky fund as a single risky asset, that asset being a particular bundle of securities. As we shift in and out of safe assets, we simply alter our holdings of that bundle of securities commensurately.

With this simplification, we turn to the desirability of reducing risk by changing the risky/risk-free asset mix, that is, reducing risk by decreasing the proportion  $y$ . As long as we do not alter the weights of each security within the risky portfolio, the probability distribution of the rate of return on the risky portfolio remains unchanged by the asset reallocation. What will change is the probability distribution of the rate of return on the complete portfolio that consists of the risky asset and the risk-free asset.

# Concept Check 6.3

What will be the dollar value of your position in equities  $(E)$ , and its proportion in your overall portfolio, if you decide to hold  $50\%$  of your investment budget in Ready Asset?

# 6.3 The Risk-Free Asset

By virtue of its power to tax and control the money supply, only the government can issue default-free bonds. Even the default-free guarantee by itself is not sufficient to make the bonds risk-free in real terms. The only risk-free asset in real terms would be a default-free price-indexed bond. Moreover, even that bond would offer a guaranteed real return only if its maturity matched the investor's desired holding period. Even inflation-indexed bonds are subject to interest rate risk because real interest rates change unpredictably through time.

Nevertheless, it is common practice to view Treasury bills as "the" risk-free asset. Their short-term nature makes their prices insensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Indeed, an investor can lock in a short-term nominal return by buying a bill and holding it to maturity. Moreover, inflation uncertainty over the course of a few weeks, or even months, is negligible compared with the uncertainty of stock market returns.

In addition to Treasury bills, many investors view a broad range of money market instruments as effectively risk-free assets. All the money market instruments are virtually free of interest rate risk because of their short maturities and usually pose little default or credit risk. Money market funds hold a variety of these low-risk instruments, so investors may also treat these funds as their effective risk-free asset. As discussed in Chapter 4, this is particularly true of government (as opposed to prime) funds.

# 6.4 Portfolios of One Risky Asset and a Risk-Free Asset

In this section, we examine the risk-return combinations available to investors once the properties of the risky portfolio have been determined. This is the "technical" part of capital allocation. In the next section we address the "personal" part of the problem—the individual's choice of the preferred risk-return combination from the feasible set.

Suppose the investor has already decided on the composition of the risky portfolio,  $P$ . Now the concern is with capital allocation, that is, the proportion of the investment budget,  $y$ , to be allocated to  $P$ . The remaining proportion,  $1 - y$ , will be invested in the risk-free asset,  $F$ .

Denote the risky rate of return of  $P$  by  $r_P$ , its expected rate of return by  $E(r_P)$ , and its standard deviation by  $\sigma_P$ . The rate of return on the risk-free asset is denoted as  $r_f$ . In our numerical example, we will make the following assumptions:

Expected return,  $E(r_{P}) = 10\%$

Standard deviation,  $\sigma_{P} = 22\%$

Risk-free rate,  $r_f = 2\%$

Thus, the risk premium on the risky asset is  $E(r_{P}) - r_{f} = 8\%$

With a proportion,  $y$ , in the risky portfolio, and  $1 - y$  in the risk-free asset, the rate of return on the complete portfolio, denoted  $C$ , is  $r_C$  where

$$ r _ {C} = y r _ {P} + (1 - y) r _ {f} \tag {6.2}
$$

Taking the expectation of this portfolio's rate of return,

$$
\begin{array}{l} E \left(r _ {C}\right) = y E \left(r _ {P}\right) + (1 - y) r _ {f} \\ = r _ {f} + y \left[ E \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f} \right] = 2 + y (1 0 - 2) \tag {6.3} \\ \end{array}
$$

This equation has a straightforward interpretation: The base rate of return for any portfolio is the risk-free rate. In addition, the portfolio is expected to earn a proportion,  $y$ , of the risk premium of the risky portfolio,  $E(r_{P}) - r_{f}$ .

With a proportion  $y$  in a risky asset, the standard deviation of the complete portfolio is the standard deviation of the risky asset multiplied by its weight,  $y$ , in that portfolio. Because the standard deviation of the risky portfolio is  $\sigma_{P} = 22\%$ ,

$$
\sigma_ {C} = y \sigma_ {P} = 2 2 y \tag {6.4}
$$

This makes sense: The standard deviation of the complete portfolio is proportional to both the standard deviation of the risky asset and the proportion invested in it. In sum, the expected return of the complete portfolio is  $E(r_{C}) = r_{f} + y[E(r_{P}) - r_{f}] = 2 + 8y$  and the standard deviation is  $\sigma_{C} = 22y$ .

The next step is to plot the characteristics of the complete portfolio (for various choices for  $y$ ) in the expected return-standard deviation plane in Figure 6.3. The risk-free asset,  $F$ , appears on the vertical axis because its standard deviation is zero. The risky asset,  $P$ , is plotted with a standard deviation of  $22\%$  and expected return of  $10\%$ . If an investor chooses to invest solely in the risky asset, then  $y = 1.0$ , and the complete portfolio is  $P$ . If the chosen position is  $y = 0$ , then  $1 - y = 1.0$ , and the complete portfolio is the risk-free portfolio,  $F$ .

What about the more interesting midrange portfolios where  $y$  lies between 0 and 1? These portfolios will graph on the straight line connecting points  $F$  and  $P$ .

Increasing the fraction of the overall portfolio invested in the risky asset increases expected return at a rate of  $10\% - 2\% = 8\%$ , according to Equation 6.3. It also increases portfolio standard deviation at the rate of  $22\%$ , according to Equation 6.4. Therefore, the slope of the line in Figure 6.3 is

$$
S = \frac {\text {r i s e}}{\text {r u n}} = \frac {E \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f}}{\sigma_ {P}} = \frac {8}{2 2} \tag {6.5}
$$

To summarize, the vertical intercept in Figure 6.3, corresponding to a standard deviation of zero, is the return on the risk-free asset,  $2\%$ . The slope is 8/22. Thus, the expected return-standard deviation trade-off for the complete portfolio is

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/2c5ec5236a4801c9ff96d7d89a1e84cfe02bdf63af1d64292201d0091c1afd96.jpg)
Figure 6.3 The investment opportunity set with a risky asset and a risk-free asset in the expected return-standard deviation plane


$$
E \left(r _ {C}\right) = 2 \% + \frac {8}{22} \sigma_ {C} \tag{6.6}
$$

Figure 6.3 shows the investment opportunity set, the set of feasible expected return and standard deviation pairs of all portfolios resulting from different values of  $y$ . The graph is a straight line originating at  $r_f$  and going through the point labeled  $P$ . This line is called the capital allocation line (CAL) and depicts all the available risk-return combinations. The slope of the CAL, denoted  $S$ , equals the increase in the expected return of the complete portfolio per unit of additional standard deviation—in other words, incremental return per incremental risk. This reward-to-volatility ratio is usually called the Sharpe ratio (see Chapter 5) after William Sharpe, who first used it extensively.

A portfolio equally divided between the risky asset and the risk-free asset, that is, where  $y = .5$ , will have an expected rate of return of  $E(r_{C}) = 2 + .5 \times 8 = 6\%$ , implying a risk premium of  $4\%$ , and a standard deviation of  $\sigma_{C} = .5 \times 22 = 11\%$ . It will plot on the line  $FP$  midway between  $F$  and  $P$ . Its Sharpe ratio is  $S = 4 / 11 = .36$ , precisely the same as that of portfolio  $P$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/59f78773a775f7d3d53110dc6f9f11a753806190caf1098e2001deb4a7f0c064.jpg)

# Concept Check 6.4

Can the Sharpe (reward-to-volatility) ratio,  $S = [E(r_{C}) - r_{f}] / \sigma_{C}$ , of any combination of the risky asset and the risk-free asset be different from the ratio for the risky asset taken alone,  $[E(r_{P}) - r_{f}] / \sigma_{P}$ , which, in this case, is .36?

What about points on the CAL to the right of portfolio  $P$ ? These are available using leverage, if investors can borrow at the (risk-free) rate of  $r_f = 2\%$  and invest the borrowed funds in portfolio  $P$ .

# Example 6.3 Leverage

Suppose the investment budget is  \$300,000 and our investor borrows an additional\$ 120,000, investing the total available funds in the risky asset. This is a levered position in the risky asset, financed in part by borrowing. In that case

$$ y = \frac {4 2 0 , 0 0 0}{3 0 0 , 0 0 0} = 1. 4
$$ and  $1 - y = 1 - 1.4 = -.4$ , reflecting a short (borrowing) position in the risk-free asset. Rather than lending at a  $2\%$  interest rate, the investor borrows at  $2\%$ . The distribution of the portfolio rate of return still exhibits the same Sharpe ratio:


$$
E (r _ {C}) = 2 \% + (1.4 \times 8 \%) = 13.2 \%
$$

$$
\sigma_ {C} = 1.4 \times 22 \% = 30.8 \%
$$

$$
S = \frac {E (r _ {C}) - r _ {f}}{\sigma_ {C}} = \frac {1 3 . 2 - 2}{3 0 . 8} = . 3 6
$$

As one might expect, the levered portfolio has a higher standard deviation than an unlevered position in the risky asset.

In reality, of course, nongovernment investors cannot borrow at the risk-free rate. The risk of a borrower's default leads lenders to demand higher interest rates on loans. Therefore, the nongovernment investor's borrowing cost will exceed the lending rate of  $r_f = 2\%$ . Suppose the borrowing rate is  $r_f^B = 4\%$ . Then, in the borrowing range, the Sharpe ratio, the slope of the CAL, will be  $\left[ E(r_P) - r_f^B \right] / \sigma_P = 6 / 22 = .27$ . The CAL will therefore be "kinked" at point  $P$ , as shown in Figure 6.4. To the left of  $P$  the investor is lending at  $2\%$ , and the slope of the CAL is .36. To the right of  $P$ , where  $y > 1$ , the investor is borrowing at  $4\%$  to finance extra investments in the risky asset, and the slope is .27.

In practice, borrowing to invest in the risky portfolio is straightforward if you have a margin account with a broker. All you have to do is tell your broker that you want to buy "on margin." Margin purchases may not exceed  $50\%$  of the purchase value. Therefore, if your net worth in the account is  $\$300,000$ , the broker is allowed to lend you up to  $\$300,000$  to purchase additional stock. $^5$  You would then have  $\$600,000$  on the asset side of your account and  $\$300,000$  on the liability side, resulting in  $y = 2.0$ .

# Concept Check 6.5

Suppose the expected rate of return on the risky asset increases from  $10\%$  to  $12\%$ . If all other parameters remain unchanged, what will be the slope of the CAL for  $y \leq 1$  and  $y > 1$ ?

# 6.5 Risk Tolerance and Asset Allocation

We have shown how to find the CAL, the graph of all feasible risk-return combinations available for capital allocation. The investor confronting the CAL now must choose her preferred complete portfolio,  $C$ , from the set of feasible choices. This choice entails a trade-off between risk and return. Individual differences in risk aversion lead to different capital allocation choices even when facing an identical opportunity set (i.e., the same risk-free rate and Sharpe ratio). In particular, more risk-averse investors will choose to hold less of the risky asset and more of the risk-free asset.

Margin purchases require the investor to maintain the securities in a margin account with the broker. If the value of the securities falls below a "maintenance margin," a "margin call" is sent out, requiring a deposit to bring the net worth of the account up to the appropriate level. If the margin call is not met, regulations mandate that some or all of the securities be sold by the broker and the proceeds used to reestablish the required margin. See Chapter 3, Section 3.8, for further discussion.

The expected return on the complete portfolio is given by Equation 6.3:  $E(r_{C}) = r_{f} + y[E(r_{P}) - r_{f}] = .02 + y(.10 - .08)$ . Its variance is, from Equation 6.4,  $\sigma_{C}^{2} = y^{2}\sigma_{P}^{2} = y^{2}\times .22^{2}$ . Investors choose the allocation to the risky asset,  $y$ , that maximizes their utility function as given by Equation 6.1:  $U = E(r) - \frac{1}{2} A\sigma^2$ . As the allocation to the risky asset increases (higher  $y$ ), expected return increases, but so does volatility, so utility can increase or decrease. Table 6.4 shows utility levels for different values of  $y$ . Initially, utility increases as  $y$  increases, but eventually it declines.

Figure 6.5 is a plot of the utility function from Table 6.4. The graph shows that utility is highest at  $y = .41$ . When  $y$  is less than .41, investors are willing to assume more risk to increase expected return. But at higher levels of  $y$ , risk is higher, and additional allocations to the risky asset are undesirable—beyond this point, further increases in risk dominate the increase in expected return and reduce utility.

To solve the utility maximization problem more generally, we write the problem as follows:

$$
\underset {y} {\operatorname {M a x}} U = E \left(r _ {C}\right) - 1 / 2 A \sigma_ {C} ^ {2} = r _ {f} + y \left[ E \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f} \right] - 1 / 2 A y ^ {2} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2}
$$

Figure 6.5 Utility as a function of allocation to the risky asset,  $y$

If you've taken a calculus course, you will recall that the maximization problem is solved by setting the derivative of this expression with respect to  $y$  equal to zero. Doing so and solving for  $y$  gives us the optimal position in the risky asset,  $y^*$ , as follows:

$$ y ^ {*} = \frac {E \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f}}{A \sigma_ {P} ^ {2}} \tag {6.7}
$$

This solution shows that the optimal position in the risky asset is inversely proportional to the level of risk aversion and the level of risk (as measured by the variance) and directly proportional to the risk premium offered by the risky asset.

# Example 6.4 Capital Allocation

Using our numerical example  $[r_f = 2\%, E(r_P) = 10\%$ , and  $\sigma_P = 22\%]$ , and expressing all returns as decimals, the optimal solution for an investor with a coefficient of risk aversion  $A = 4$  is

$$ y ^ {*} = \frac {. 1 0 -. 0 2}{4 \times . 2 2 ^ {2}} = . 4 1
$$

In other words, this particular investor will invest  $41\%$  of the investment budget in the risky asset and  $59\%$  in the risk-free asset. As we saw in Figure 6.5, this is the value of  $y$  at which utility is maximized.

With  $41\%$  invested in the risky portfolio, the expected return and standard deviation of the complete portfolio are

$$
E \left(r _ {C}\right) = 2 + \left[ . 4 1 \times (1 0 - 2) \right] = 5. 2 8
$$

$$
\sigma_ {C} = . 41 \times 22 = 9.02 \%
$$

The risk premium of the complete portfolio is  $E(r_{C}) - r_{f} = 3.28\%$ , which is obtained by taking on a portfolio with a standard deviation of  $9.02\%$ . Notice that  $3.28 / 9.02 = .36$ , which is the reward-to-volatility (Sharpe) ratio of any complete portfolio given the parameters of this example.

An alternative, graphical way of presenting this decision problem is to use indifference curves. To illustrate how to build an indifference curve, consider an investor with risk aversion  $A = 4$  who currently holds all her wealth in a risk-free portfolio yielding  $r_f = 2\%$ . Because the variance of such a portfolio is zero, Equation 6.1 tells us that its utility value is  $U = .02$ . Now we find the expected return the investor would require to maintain the same level of utility when holding a risky portfolio, say, with  $\sigma = 1\%$ . We use Equation 6.1 to find how much  $E(r)$  must increase to compensate for the higher value of  $\sigma$ :

$$
U = E (r) - \frac {1}{2} \times A \times \sigma^ {2}
$$

$$
. 0 2 = E (r) - \frac {1}{2} \times 4 \times . 0 1 ^ {2}
$$

This implies that the necessary expected return increases to

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {R e q u i r e d} E (r) = . 0 2 + \frac {1}{2} \times A \times \sigma^ {2} \tag {6.8} \\ = . 0 2 + \frac {1}{2} \times 4 \times . 0 1 ^ {2} = . 0 2 0 2 \\ \end{array}
$$

The derivative with respect to  $y$  equals  $E(r_{P}) - r_{f} - yA\sigma_{P}^{2}$ . Setting this expression equal to zero and solving for  $y$  yields Equation 6.7.

# Table 6.5

We can repeat this calculation for other levels of  $\sigma$ , each time finding the value of  $E(r)$  necessary to maintain  $U = .02$ . This process will yield all combinations of expected return and volatility with utility level of .02; plotting these combinations gives us the indifference curve.

We can readily generate an investor's indifference curves using a spreadsheet. Table 6.5 contains risk-return combinations with utility values of .02 for two investors, one with  $A = 2$  and the other with  $A = 4$ . The plot of these indifference curves appears in Figure 6.6. Notice that the intercepts of the indifference curves, where standard deviation equals zero, are both .02, exactly the utility provided by the risk-free asset. The indifference curve for the more risk-averse investor (with  $A = 4$ ) is higher than the curve for the  $A = 2$  investor. This is because greater risk aversion increases the risk premium required to compensate for the "utility-penalty" corresponding to any standard deviation.

Figure 6.7 Finding the optimal complete portfolio by using indifference curves

Figure 6.6 demonstrates that more risk-averse investors have steeper indifference curves than less risk-averse investors. Steeper curves mean that investors require a greater increase in expected return to compensate for an increase in portfolio risk.

Higher indifference curves correspond to higher levels of utility. They provide higher expected return for any level of volatility. The investor thus attempts to find the complete portfolio on the highest possible indifference curve. When we superimpose plots of indifference curves on the investment opportunity set represented by the capital allocation line as in Figure 6.7, we can identify the highest possible indifference curve that still touches the CAL. That curve is tangent to the CAL, and the tangency point corresponds to the standard deviation and expected return of the optimal complete portfolio.

To illustrate, Table 6.6 provides calculations for four indifference curves (with utility levels of .02, .028, .03653, .044) for an investor with  $A = 4$ . Columns 2-5 use Equation 6.8 to calculate the expected return that must be paired with the standard deviation in column 1 to provide the utility value corresponding to each curve. Column 6 uses Equation 6.5 to calculate  $E(r_{C})$  on the CAL for the standard deviation  $\sigma_{C}$  in column 1:

$$
E \left(r _ {C}\right) = r _ {f} + \left[ E \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f} \right] \frac {\sigma_ {C}}{\sigma_ {P}} = 2 + [ 1 0 - 2 ] \frac {\sigma_ {C}}{2 2}
$$

Figure 6.7 graphs the four indifference curves and the CAL. The graph reveals that the indifference curve with  $U = .03653$  is tangent to the CAL; the tangency point corresponds to the complete portfolio that maximizes utility. The tangency point occurs at  $\sigma_{C} = 9.02\%$  and  $E(r_{C}) = 5.28\%$ , the risk-return parameters of the optimal complete portfolio with  $y^{*} = 0.41$ . These values match our algebraic solution using Equation 6.7.

We conclude that the choice for  $y^*$ , the fraction of overall investment funds to place in the risky portfolio, is determined by risk aversion (the slope of indifference curves) and the Sharpe ratio (the slope of the opportunity set).

# Non-normal Returns

In the foregoing analysis, we implicitly assumed normality of returns by treating standard deviation as the appropriate measure of risk. But as we discussed in Chapter 5, departures from normality could result in extreme losses with far greater likelihood than would be plausible under a normal distribution. These exposures, which are typically measured by value at risk (VaR) or expected shortfall (ES), also would be important to investors.

Therefore, an appropriate extension of our analysis would be to present investors with forecasts of VaR and ES. Taking the capital allocation from the normal-based analysis as a benchmark, investors facing fat-tailed distributions might consider reducing their allocation to the risky portfolio in favor of an increase in the allocation to the risk-free vehicle.

Probabilities of moderate outcomes can be readily assessed from experience because of the high relative frequency of such observations. Extreme negative values are thankfully rare, but for that very reason, accurately assessing their probabilities is virtually impossible.

Nevertheless, "black swans," those rare but high-impact events that can result in drastic security returns, clearly concern investors. We will see evidence of their concern when we look at empirical evidence on the pricing of options in Chapter 21.

# 6.6 Passive Strategies: The Capital Market Line

The CAL is derived using the risk-free and "the" risky portfolio,  $P$ . Determination of the assets to include in  $P$  may result from a passive or an active strategy. A passive strategy describes a portfolio decision that avoids any direct or indirect security analysis. At first blush, a passive strategy would appear to be naive. As will become apparent, however, forces of supply and demand in large capital markets may make such a strategy the best choice for many investors.

In Chapter 5, we presented a compilation of the history of rates of return on different portfolios. The data are available at Professor Kenneth French's Web site, MBA.tuck .dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/dataLibrary.html. We can use these data to examine various passive strategies.

A natural candidate for a passively held risky asset would be a well-diversified portfolio of common stocks such as the "U.S. Market" described in Chapter 5. Because a passive strategy requires that we devote no resources to acquiring information on any individual stock or group of stocks, we must follow a "neutral" diversification strategy. One way is to select a diversified portfolio of stocks that mirrors the value of the corporate sector of the entire economy. This results in a portfolio in which, for example, the proportion invested in Microsoft stock will be the ratio of Microsoft's total market value to the market value of all listed stocks.

Table 6.7 summarizes the performance of the U.S. Market portfolio over the 95-year period 1927-2021, as well as for four subperiods. The table shows the average return for the portfolio, the annual return realized by rolling over 1-month T-bills for the same period, as well as the resultant average excess return (risk premium) and its standard deviation. The Sharpe ratio was .44 for the overall period, 1927-2021. In other words, stock market investors enjoyed an additional .44\% average excess return over the T-bill rate for every 1\% increase in standard deviation.

But the risk-reward trade-off we infer from the historical data is far from precise. This is because the excess return on the market portfolio is so variable, with an annual standard deviation of  $20.25\%$ . With such high year-by-year volatility, it is no surprise that the reward-to-risk trade-off is also highly variable. The Sharpe ratios across subperiods vary

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Period</td><td colspan="2">Average annual return</td><td colspan="3">U.S. Equity Market</td></tr><tr><td>U.S. equity</td><td>1-month T-bills</td><td>Excess return</td><td>Standard deviation</td><td>Sharpe ratio</td></tr><tr><td>1927–2021</td><td>12.17</td><td>3.30</td><td>8.87</td><td>20.25</td><td>0.44</td></tr><tr><td>1927–1950</td><td>10.26</td><td>0.93</td><td>9.33</td><td>26.57</td><td>0.35</td></tr><tr><td>1951–1974</td><td>10.21</td><td>3.59</td><td>6.63</td><td>20.32</td><td>0.33</td></tr><tr><td>1975–1998</td><td>17.97</td><td>6.98</td><td>11.00</td><td>14.40</td><td>0.76</td></tr><tr><td>1999–2021</td><td>10.16</td><td>1.66</td><td>8.50</td><td>18.85</td><td>0.45</td></tr></table> by a multiple of more than 2, ranging from .33 to .76. The lesson here is that we should be very humble when we use historical data to forecast future returns. Returns and the risk-return trade-off are extremely difficult to predict, and we can have only a loose sense of what that trade-off will be in coming periods.

Table 6.7 Average annual return on stocks and 1-month T-bills; standard deviation and Sharpe ratio of stocks over time


We call the capital allocation line provided by short-term T-bills and a broad index of common stocks the capital market line (CML). A passive strategy generates an investment opportunity set that is represented by the CML.

How reasonable is it for an investor to pursue a passive strategy? We cannot answer such a question without comparing the strategy to the costs and benefits accruing to an active portfolio strategy. Some thoughts are relevant even at this point, however.

First, the alternative active strategy is not free. Whether you choose to invest the time and cost to acquire the information needed to generate an optimal active portfolio of risky assets, or whether you delegate the task to a professional who will charge a fee, constitution of an active portfolio is more expensive than a passive one. Passive management entails only negligible costs to purchase T-bills and very modest management fees to either an exchange-traded index fund or mutual fund. Vanguard, for example, operates several index portfolios. One, the 500 Index Fund, tracks the S&P 500. It purchases shares of the firms comprising the S&P 500 in proportion to the market values of the outstanding equity of each firm, and therefore essentially replicates the S&P 500 index. It has one of the lowest operating expenses (as a percentage of assets) of all mutual stock funds precisely because it requires minimal managerial effort. Whereas the S&P 500 is primarily an index of large, high-capitalization (large cap) stocks, another Vanguard index fund, the Total Stock Market Index Fund, is more inclusive and provides investors with exposure to the entire U.S. equity market, including small- and mid-cap stocks as well as growth and value stocks. It is nearly identical to what we have called the U.S. Market Index.

A second reason to pursue a passive strategy is the free-rider benefit. If there are many active, knowledgeable investors who quickly bid up prices of undervalued assets and force down prices of overvalued assets (by selling), we have to conclude that at any time most assets will be at least approximately fairly priced. Therefore, a well-diversified portfolio of common stock will be a reasonably fair buy, and the passive strategy may not be inferior to that of the average active investor. (We will elaborate on this argument and provide a more comprehensive analysis of the relative success of passive strategies in later chapters.) As we saw in Chapter 4, passive index funds have actually outperformed most actively managed funds in the past decades, and investors have responded to their lower costs and better performance by directing their investments into these products.

To summarize, a passive strategy involves investment in two passive portfolios: virtually risk-free short-term T-bills (or, alternatively, a money market fund) and a stock fund that mimics a broad market index. The capital allocation line representing such a strategy is called the capital market line. Historically, in the 1927 to 2021 period, the passive risky portfolio offered an average risk premium of  $8.87\%$  and a standard deviation of  $20.25\%$ , resulting in a reward-to-volatility ratio of .44.

Passive investors allocate their investment budgets among instruments according to their degree of risk aversion. We can use our analysis to deduce a typical investor's risk-aversion parameter. From Table 1.1 in Chapter 1, we estimate that approximately  $69.3\%$  of net worth is invested in a broad array of risky assets. We assume this portfolio has the same reward-risk characteristics that the U.S. equity market has exhibited since 1927, as documented in Table 6.7. Substituting these values in Equation 6.7, we obtain


$$ y ^ {*} = \frac {E \left(r _ {M}\right) - r _ {f}}{A \sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} = \frac {. 0 8 8 7}{A \times . 2 0 2 5 ^ {2}} = . 6 9 3
$$ which implies a coefficient of risk aversion of


$$
A = \frac {. 0 8 8 7}{. 6 9 3 \times . 2 0 2 5 ^ {2}} = 3. 1 2
$$

Of course, this calculation is highly speculative. We have assumed that the average investor holds the naïve view that historical average rates of return and standard deviations are the best estimates of expected rates of return and risk, looking to the future. To the extent that the average investor takes advantage of contemporary information in addition to simple historical data, our estimate of  $A = 3.12$  would be unjustified. Nevertheless, a broad range of studies, taking into account the full range of available assets, places the degree of risk aversion for the representative investor in the range of 2.0 to 4.0.

# Concept Check 6.7

Suppose that expectations about the U.S. equity market and the T-bill rate are the same as they were in 2021, but you find that a greater proportion is invested in T-bills today than in 2021. What can you conclude about the change in risk tolerance over the years since 2021?

See, for example, I. Friend and M. Blume, “The Demand for Risky Assets,” American Economic Review 64 (1974); or S. J. Grossman and R. J. Shiller, “The Determinants of the Variability of Stock Market Prices,” American Economic Review 71 (1981).

1. Speculation is the undertaking of a risky investment for its risk premium. The risk premium has to be large enough to compensate a risk-averse investor for the risk of the investment.
2. A fair game is a risky prospect that has a zero risk premium. It will not be undertaken by a risk-averse investor.
3. Investors' preferences toward the expected return and volatility of a portfolio may be expressed by a utility function that is higher for higher expected returns and lower for higher portfolio variances. More risk-averse investors will apply greater penalties for risk. We can describe these preferences graphically using indifference curves.
4. The desirability of a risky portfolio to a risk-averse investor may be summarized by the certainty equivalent value of the portfolio. The certainty equivalent rate of return is a value that, if received with certainty, would yield the same utility as the risky portfolio.
5. Shifting funds from the risky portfolio to the risk-free asset is the simplest way to reduce risk. Other methods involve diversification of the risky portfolio and hedging. We take up these methods in later chapters.
6. T-bills provide a perfectly risk-free asset in nominal terms only. Nevertheless, the standard deviation of real returns on short-term T-bills is small compared to that of other assets such as long-term bonds and common stocks, so for the purpose of our analysis we consider T-bills as the risk-free asset. Money market funds hold, in addition to T-bills, short-term relatively safe obligations such as repurchase agreements or bank CDs. These entail some default risk, but again, the additional risk is small relative to most other risky assets. For convenience, we often refer to money market funds as risk-free assets.

# SUMMARY

7. An investor's risky portfolio (the risky asset) can be characterized by its reward-to-volatility or Sharpe ratio,  $S = [E(r_{P}) - r_{f}] / \sigma_{P}$ . This ratio is also the slope of the CAL, the line that, when graphed, goes from the risk-free asset through the risky asset. All combinations of the risky asset and the risk-free asset lie on this line. Other things equal, an investor would prefer a steeper-sloping CAL because that means higher expected return for any level of risk. If the borrowing rate is greater than the lending rate, the CAL will be "kinked" at the point of the risky asset.
8. The investor's degree of risk aversion is characterized by the slope of the indifference curve. Indifference curves show, at any level of expected return and risk, the required risk premium for taking on each additional percentage point of standard deviation. More risk-averse investors have steeper indifference curves; that is, they require a greater risk premium for taking on more risk.
9. The optimal position,  $y^{*}$ , in the risky asset is proportional to the risk premium and inversely proportional to the variance and degree of risk aversion:

$$ y ^ {*} = \frac {E (r _ {P}) - r _ {f}}{A \sigma_ {P} ^ {2}}
$$

Graphically, this portfolio represents the point at which the indifference curve is tangent to the CAL.

10. A passive investment strategy disregards security analysis, targeting instead the risk-free asset and a broad portfolio of risky assets such as the S&P 500 stock portfolio. If in 2021 investors took the mean historical return and standard deviation of the S&P 500 as proxies for its expected return and standard deviation, then the values of outstanding assets would imply a degree of risk aversion of about  $A = 3.12$  for the average investor. This is in line with other studies, which estimate typical risk aversion in the range of 2.0 through 4.0.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. For the  $A = 4$  investor, the utility of the risky portfolio is

$$
U = . 1 5 - \left(\frac {1}{2} \times 4 \times . 3 ^ {2}\right) = -. 0 3
$$ while the utility of bills is


$$
U = . 0 2 - (\frac {1}{2} \times 4 \times 0) = . 0 2
$$

The investor will prefer bills to the risky portfolio. (Of course, a mixture of bills and the portfolio might be even better, but that is not a choice here.)

For the less risk-averse investor with  $A = 2$ , the utility of the risky portfolio is

$$
U = . 1 5 - \left(\frac {1}{2} \times 2 \times . 3 ^ {2}\right) = . 0 6
$$ while the utility of bills is again .02. The less risk-averse investor prefers the risky portfolio.


2. The less risk-averse investor has a shallower indifference curve. An increase in risk requires less increase in expected return to restore utility to the original level.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/bc9c5467f17a01fbb91101a323d5eb752cda3a144d7602d8996ea0cc7602f744.jpg)

3. Holding  $50\%$  of your invested capital in Ready Assets means that your investment proportion in the risky portfolio is reduced from  $70\%$  to  $50\%$ .

Your risky portfolio is constructed to invest  $54\%$  in  $E$  and  $46\%$  in  $B$ . Thus, the proportion of  $E$  in your overall portfolio is  $.5 \times 54\% = 27\%$ , and the dollar value of your position in  $E$  is \$300,000 \times$  .27 = \81,000.

4. In the expected return-standard deviation plane, all portfolios that are constructed from the same risky and risk-free funds (with various proportions) lie on a line from the risk-free rate through the risky fund. The slope of the CAL (capital allocation line) is the same everywhere; hence, the reward-to-volatility (Sharpe) ratio is the same for all of these portfolios. Formally, if you invest a proportion,  $y$ , in a risky fund with expected return  $E(r_{P})$  and standard deviation  $\sigma_{P}$ , and the remainder,  $1 - y$ , in a risk-free asset with a sure rate  $r_{f}$ , then the portfolio's expected return and standard deviation are


$$
\begin{array}{l} E \left(r _ {C}\right) = r _ {f} + y \left[ E \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f} \right] \\ \sigma_ {C} = y \sigma_ {P} \\ \end{array}
$$ and therefore the Sharpe ratio of this portfolio is


$$
S _ {C} = \frac {E (r _ {C}) - r _ {f}}{\sigma_ {C}} = \frac {y [ E (r _ {P}) - r _ {f} ]}{y \sigma_ {P}} = \frac {E (r _ {P}) - r _ {f}}{\sigma_ {P}}
$$ which is independent of the proportion  $y$ .


5. The lending and borrowing rates are unchanged at  $r_f = 2\%$ ,  $r_f^B = 4\%$ . The standard deviation of the risky portfolio is still  $22\%$ , but the expected rate of return on the risky portfolio increases from  $10\%$  to  $12\%$ .

The slope of the two-part CAL is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {E \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f}}{\sigma_ {P}} \text {f o r t h e l e n d i n g r a n g e} \\ \frac {E \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f} ^ {B}}{\sigma_ {P}} \text {f o r t h e b o r r o w i n g r a n g e} \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus, in both cases, the slope increases: from 8/22 to 10/22 for the lending range and from 6/22 to 8/22 for the borrowing range.

6.  $a$ . The parameters are  $r_f = .02$ ,  $E(r_P) = .10$ ,  $\sigma_P = .22$ . An investor with a degree of risk aversion  $A$  will choose a proportion  $y$  in the risky portfolio of

$$ y = \frac {E (r _ {P}) - r _ {f}}{A \sigma_ {P} ^ {2}}
$$

With the assumed parameters and with  $A = 3$ , we find that

$$ y = \frac {. 1 0 -. 0 2}{3 \times . 0 4 8 4} = . 5 5
$$

When the degree of risk aversion decreases from the original value of 4 to the new value of 3, investment in the risky portfolio increases from  $41\%$  to  $55\%$ . Accordingly, both the expected return and standard deviation of the optimal portfolio increase:

$$
\begin{array}{l} E \left(r _ {C}\right) = . 0 2 + (. 5 5 \times . 0 8) = . 0 6 4 (\text {b e f o r e :}. 0 5 2 8) \\ \sigma_ {C} = . 5 5 \times . 2 2 =. 1 2 1 (\text {b e f o r e :}. 0 9 0 2) \\ \end{array}
$$ b. All investors whose degree of risk aversion is such that they would hold the risky portfolio in a proportion equal to  $100\%$  or less  $(y \leq 1.00)$  are lending rather than borrowing, and so are unaffected by the borrowing rate. The individuals just at the dividing line separating lenders from borrowers are the ones who choose to hold exactly  $100\%$  of their assets in the risky portfolio  $(y = 1)$ . We can solve for the degree of risk aversion of these "cut off" investors from the parameters of the investment opportunities:


$$ y = 1 = \frac {E (r _ {P}) - r _ {f}}{A \sigma_ {P} ^ {2}} = \frac {. 0 8}{. 0 4 8 4 A}
$$ which implies


$$
A = \frac {. 0 8}{. 0 4 8 4} = 1. 6 5
$$

Any investor who is more risk tolerant (i.e.,  $A < 1.65$ ) would choose to borrow if the borrowing rate were  $2\%$ . These are the investors who are affected by the higher borrowing rate. For borrowers,

$$ y = \frac {E (r _ {P}) - r _ {f} ^ {B}}{A \sigma_ {P} ^ {2}}
$$

Suppose, for example, an investor has  $A = 1.1$ . If  $r_f = r_f^B = 2\%$ , this investor would have chosen to invest in the risky portfolio:

$$ y = \frac {. 0 8}{1 . 1 \times . 0 4 8 4} = 1. 5 0
$$ which means that the investor would have borrowed an amount equal to  $50\%$  of her own investment capital, placing all the proceeds in the risky portfolio. But at the higher borrowing rate,  $r_f^B = 4\%$ , the investor will choose to borrow less and put less in the risky asset. In this case,


$$ y = \frac {. 0 6}{1 . 1 \times . 0 4 8 4} = 1. 1 3
$$ and "only"  $13\%$  of her investment capital will be borrowed. Graphically, the line from  $r_f$  to the risky portfolio shows the CAL for lenders. The dashed part of the line originating at  $r_f$  would be relevant if the borrowing rate equaled the lending rate. When the borrowing rate exceeds the lending rate, the CAL is kinked at the point corresponding to the risky portfolio.


The following figure shows indifference curves of two investors. The steeper indifference curve portrays the more risk-averse investor, who chooses portfolio  $C_0$ , which involves lending. This investor's choice is unaffected by the borrowing rate. The more risk-tolerant investor is portrayed by the shallower-sloped indifference curves. If the lending rate equaled the borrowing rate, this investor would choose portfolio  $C_1$  on the dashed part of the CAL. When the borrowing rate is higher, this investor instead chooses portfolio  $C_2$  (in the borrowing range of the kinked CAL), which involves less borrowing than before. This investor is hurt by the increase in the borrowing rate.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/415e282f438bc8ca7ae616fbec6afd828a63e7f9fcd21601b9dbded7d241d721.jpg)

7. If all the investment parameters remain unchanged, the only reason for an investor to increase the allocation to T-bills and decrease the investment proportion in the risky asset is an increase in the degree of risk aversion. If you think that this is unlikely, then you have to reconsider your faith in your assumptions. Perhaps the U.S. equity market is not a good proxy for the optimal risky portfolio. Perhaps investors expect a higher real rate on T-bills.

# APPENDIX A: Risk Aversion, Expected Utility, and the St. Petersburg Paradox

We digress in this appendix to examine the rationale behind our contention that investors are risk averse. Recognition of risk aversion as central in investment decisions goes back at least to 1738. Daniel Bernoulli, one of a famous Swiss family of distinguished mathematicians, spent the years 1725 through 1733 in St. Petersburg, where he analyzed the following coin toss game. To enter the game, one pays an entry fee. Thereafter, a coin is tossed until the first head appears. The number of tails, denoted by  $n$ , that appears until the first head is tossed is used to compute the payoff, $R$, to the participant, as

$$
R (n) = 2 ^ {n}
$$

The probability of no tails before the first head ( $n = 0$ ) is  $1/2$  and the corresponding payoff is  \$2^0 = \$ 1. The probability of one tail and then heads ( $n = 1$ ) is  $1/2 \times 1/2$  with payoff  $2^1 = \2$ , the probability of two tails and then heads ( $n = 2$ ) is  $1/2 \times 1/2 \times 1/2$ , and so forth.

The following table illustrates the probabilities and payoffs for various outcomes:

<table><tr><td>Tails</td><td>Probability</td><td>Payoff = $R(n)</td><td>Probability × Payoff</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>1/2</td><td>$1</td><td>$1/2</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1/4</td><td>$2</td><td>$1/2</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1/8</td><td>$4</td><td>$1/2</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1/16</td><td>$8</td><td>$1/2</td></tr><tr><td>⋮</td><td>⋮</td><td>⋮</td><td>⋮</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>(1/2)n+1</td><td>\$2n</td><td>1/2</td></tr></table>

The expected payoff is therefore

$$
E (R) = \sum_ {n = 0} ^ {\infty} \Pr (n) R (n) = \frac {1}{2} + \frac {1}{2} + \dots = \infty
$$

The evaluation of this game is called the "St. Petersburg Paradox." Although the expected payoff is infinite, participants obviously will be willing to purchase tickets to play the game only at a finite, and possibly quite modest, entry fee.

Bernoulli resolved the paradox by noting that investors do not assign the same value per dollar to all payoffs. Specifically, the greater their wealth, the less their "appreciation" for each extra dollar. We can make this insight mathematically precise by assigning a welfare or utility value to any level of investor wealth. Our utility function should increase as wealth is higher, but each extra dollar of wealth should increase utility by progressively smaller amounts.[10] Modern economists would say that investors exhibit "decreasing marginal utility" from an additional payoff dollar.

Von Neumann and Morgenstern adapted this approach to investment theory in a complete axiomatic system in 1946. Avoiding unnecessary technical detail, we restrict ourselves here to an intuitive exposition of the rationale for risk aversion.

Imagine two individuals who are identical twins, except that one of them is less fortunate than the other. Peter has only  \$1,000 to his name, while Paul has a net worth of\$ 200,000. How many hours of work would each twin be willing to offer to earn one extra dollar? It is likely that Peter (the poor twin) has more essential uses for the extra money than does Paul. Therefore, Peter will offer more hours. In other words, Peter derives a greater personal welfare or assigns a greater "utility" value to the 1,001st dollar than Paul does to the 200,001st. Figure 6A.1 depicts graphically the relationship between wealth and the utility value of wealth that is consistent with this notion of decreasing marginal utility.


Individuals have different rates of decrease in their marginal utility of wealth. What is constant is the principle that the per-dollar increment to utility decreases with wealth. Functions that exhibit the property of decreasing per-unit value as the number of units grows are called concave.

One particular function that displays decreasing marginal utility is the function  \ln(R)  where  \ln(\cdot)  is the natural logarithm function and  $R  is the investor's payoff. If this function measures the utility value of wealth, the subjective utility value of the game is indeed finite, equal to .693.[11] The certain wealth level necessary to provide this utility value is 2.00 because \ln(2.00) = .693. Hence, the certainty equivalent value of the risky payoff is 2.00, which is the maximum amount a log-utility investor will pay to play Bernoulli's game. Of course, a log function will not fit all investors, but it is consistent with the risk aversion that we assume for all investors.

Figure 6A.1 Utility of wealth with a log utility function

If we substitute the "utility" value,  $\ln (R)$ , for the dollar payoff,  $R$ , to obtain an expected utility value of the game (rather than expected dollar value), we have, calling  $V(R)$  the expected utility,

$$
V (R) = \sum_ {n = 0} ^ {\infty} \Pr (n) \ln [ R (n) ] = \sum_ {n = 0} ^ {\infty} (1 / 2) ^ {n + 1} \ln (2 ^ {n}) = . 6 9 3
$$

Now consider the following simple prospect:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/cfbd2ca44cc340ddcc95b6de176b1b84b52a06ef42e52f7ce0ed7e190cb8a63b.jpg)

This is a fair game in that the expected profit is zero. Suppose, however, that the curve in Figure 6A.1 represents the investor's utility value of wealth, assuming a log utility function. Figure 6A.2 shows this curve with numerical values marked.

Figure 6A.2 shows that the loss in utility from losing  \$50,000 exceeds the gain from winning\$ 50,000. Consider the gain first. With probability  $p = .5$ , wealth goes from  $100,000 to$ 150,000. Using the log utility function, utility goes from  $\ln(100,000) = 11.51$  to  $\ln(150,000) = 11.92$ , the distance  $G$  on the graph. This gain is  $G = 11.92 - 11.51 = .41$ .

Now consider the possibility of coming up on the short end of the prospect. In that case, wealth goes from  $100,000 to$ 50,000. The loss in utility, the distance  $L$  on the graph, is  $L = \ln(100,000) - \ln(50,000) = 11.51 - 10.82 = .69$ . Thus, the loss in utility if you lose the game exceeds the utility gain if you win. This is why a risk-averse investor will prefer not to play this "fair" but risky game.

We compute the expected utility from the risky prospect:

$$
\begin{array}{l} E [ U (W) ] = p U \left(W _ {1}\right) + (1 - p) U \left(W _ {2}\right) \\ = 1 / 2 \ln (5 0, 0 0 0) + 1 / 2 \ln (1 5 0, 0 0 0) = 1 1. 3 7 \\ \end{array}
$$

If the prospect is rejected, the utility value of the (sure)  $100,000 is \ln(100,000) = 11.51$ , greater than that of the fair game (11.37). Again, we see that a risk-averse investor will reject the fair game.

Figure 6A.2 Fair games and expected utility

Using a specific utility function (such as the log utility function) allows us to compute the certainty equivalent value of the risky prospect to a given investor. This is the amount that, if received with certainty, the investor would consider equally attractive as the risky prospect.

If log utility describes the investor's preferences toward wealth outcomes, then Figure 6A.2 can also tell us what is, for the investor, the dollar value of the prospect. We ask, "What sure level of wealth has a utility value of 11.37 (which equals the expected utility from the prospect)?" A horizontal line drawn at the level 11.37 intersects the utility curve at the level of wealth  $W_{\mathrm{CE}}$ . This means that

$$
\ln \left(W _ {\mathrm {C E}}\right) = 1 1. 3 7
$$ which implies that


$$
W _ {\mathrm {C E}} = e ^ {1 1. 3 7} = \$ 8 6, 6 8 1. 8 7
$$

$W_{\mathrm{CE}}$  is therefore the certainty equivalent of the prospect. The distance  $Y$  in Figure 6A.2 is the penalty, or the downward adjustment, to the expected profit that is attributable to the risk of the prospect.

$$
Y = E (W) - W _ {\mathrm {C E}} = \\mathbb {1} 0 0, 0 0 0 - \mathbb {1} 8 6, 6 8 1. 8 7 = \mathbb {1} 3, 3 1 8. 1 3
$$

This investor views \$86,681.87 for certain as being equal in utility value as \$100,000 at risk. Therefore, the investor would be indifferent between the two.

# PROBLEMS: APPENDIX A

1. Suppose that your wealth is $250,000. You buy a $200,000 house and invest the remainder in a risk-free asset paying an annual interest rate of 6\%. There is a probability of .001 that your house will burn to the ground and its value will be reduced to zero. With a log utility of end-of-year wealth, how much would you be willing to pay for insurance (at the beginning of the year)? (Assume that if the house does not burn down, its end-of-year value still will be 200,000.)
2. If the cost of insuring your house is $1 per $1,000 of value (actuarially consistent with the .001 probability of a fire), what will be the certainty equivalent of your end-of-year wealth if you insure your house at: a.  $1 / 2$  its value.

b. Its full value.
c.  $1\frac{1}{2}$  times its value.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECK

A.1. a.  $U(W) = \sqrt{W}$

$$
U (5 0, 0 0 0) = \sqrt {5 0 , 0 0 0} = 2 2 3. 6 1

$$ d. Yes. The certainty equivalent of the risky venture is less than the expected outcome of 100,000.

e. The certainty equivalent of the risky venture to this investor is greater than it was for the log utility investor considered in the text. Hence, this utility function displays less risk aversion.

# Efficient Diversification

# 7

THE INVESTMENT DECISION can be viewed as a top-down process: (1) capital allocation between the risky portfolio and risk-free assets, (2) asset allocation within the risky portfolio across broad asset classes (e.g., U.S. stocks, international stocks, and long-term bonds), and (3) security selection of individual assets within each asset class.

Capital allocation, as we saw in Chapter 6, determines the investor's exposure to risk. The optimal capital allocation is determined by risk aversion as well as estimates of the risk-return trade-off of the investor's risky portfolio.

In principle, asset allocation and security selection are technically identical; both aim at identifying the optimal risky portfolio, specifically, the combination of risky assets that provides the best risk-return trade-off or, equivalently, the highest Sharpe ratio. In practice, however, asset allocation and security selection are typically separated into two steps, in which the broad outlines of the portfolio are established first (asset allocation), while details concerning specific securities are filled in later (security selection). After we show how the optimal risky portfolio may be constructed, we will consider the costs and benefits of pursuing this two-step approach.

We begin by illustrating the potential gains from simple diversification into many assets. We then turn to efficient diversification, starting with an investment menu of only two risky assets, then adding the risk-free asset, and, finally, incorporating the entire universe of available risky securities. We learn how diversification can reduce risk without affecting expected returns. This accomplished, we reexamine the rationale for the portfolio construction hierarchy: capital allocation, followed by asset allocation, followed by security selection. Finally, we offer insight into the power of diversification by drawing an analogy between it and the workings of the insurance industry.


The portfolios we discuss in this and the following chapters presume a short-term horizon—even if the overall investment horizon is long, portfolio composition can be rebalanced or updated almost continuously. For these short horizons, the assumption of normality is sufficiently accurate to describe holding-period returns, and we will be concerned only with portfolio means and variances.

In Appendix A, we demonstrate how the optimal risky portfolio can be constructed using Excel. Appendix B provides a review of portfolio statistics with emphasis on the intuition behind covariance and correlation measures. Even if you have had a good quantitative methods course, it may well be worth skimming.

# 7.1 Diversification and Portfolio Risk

Suppose your portfolio is composed of only one stock, say, Digital Computer Corp. What would be the sources of risk to this "portfolio"? You might think of two broad sources of uncertainty. First, there is the risk that comes from conditions in the general economy, such as the business cycle, inflation, interest rates, and exchange rates. None of these macroeconomic factors can be predicted with certainty, and all affect the rate of return on Digital stock. In addition to these macroeconomic factors, there are firm-specific influences, such as Digital's success in research and development and personnel changes. These factors affect Digital without noticeably affecting other firms in the economy.

Now consider a naïve diversification strategy, in which you include additional securities in your portfolio. For example, place half your funds in ExxonMobil and half in Digital. What should happen to portfolio risk? To the extent that the firm-specific influences on the two stocks differ, diversification should reduce portfolio risk. For example, when oil prices fall, hurting ExxonMobil, computer prices might rise, helping Digital. The two effects are offsetting and stabilize portfolio return.

But why end diversification at only two stocks? If we diversify into many more securities, we continue to spread out our exposure to firm-specific factors, and portfolio volatility should continue to fall. Ultimately, however, even with a large number of stocks, we cannot avoid risk altogether because virtually all securities are affected by the common macroeconomic factors. For example, if all stocks are affected by the business cycle, we cannot avoid exposure to business cycle risk no matter how many stocks we hold.

When all risk is firm-specific, as in Figure 7.1, Panel A, diversification can reduce risk to arbitrarily low levels. The reason is that with all risk sources independent, the exposure to any particular source of risk is reduced to a negligible level. Risk reduction by spreading exposure across many independent risk sources is sometimes called

B the insurance principle: An insurance company depends on such diversification when it writes many policies insuring against many independent sources of risk, each policy being a small part of the company's overall portfolio. (We discuss the insurance principle in more detail in Section 7.5.)

Figure 7.2 Portfolio diversification. The average annualized standard deviation of returns of portfolios composed of only one stock selected at random from the NYSE was  $27.8\%$  in the decade ending 2017. Portfolio risk fell rapidly as the number of stocks included in the portfolio increased. In the limit, portfolio risk could be reduced to only  $17.4\%$ .

Source: Authors' calculations. This is an update of a figure that first appeared in Meir Statman, "How Many Stocks Make a Diversified Portfolio?" Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis 22 (September 1987).


When common sources of risk affect all firms, however, even extensive diversification cannot eliminate risk. In Figure 7.1, Panel B, portfolio standard deviation falls as the number of securities increases, but it cannot be reduced to zero. The risk that remains even after extensive diversification is called market risk, risk that is attributable to marketwide risk sources. Such risk is also called systematic risk, or nondiversifiable risk. In contrast, the risk that can be eliminated by diversification is called unique risk, firm-specific risk, nonsystematic risk, or diversifiable risk.

This analysis is well borne out empirically. Figure 7.2 shows the average standard deviation of equally weighted portfolios constructed by selecting stocks at random as a function of the number of stocks in the portfolio. On average, portfolio risk does fall with diversification, but the power of diversification to reduce risk is limited by systematic sources of risk.

# 7.2 Portfolios of Two Risky Assets

In the last section we considered naïve diversification using equally weighted portfolios. It is time now to study efficient diversification, whereby we construct risky portfolios to provide the lowest possible risk for any given level of expected return.

Table 7.1
Descriptive statistics for two mutual funds

<table><tr><td></td><td>Debt</td><td>Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Expected return, E(r)</td><td>8\%</td><td>13\%</td></tr><tr><td>Standard deviation, σ</td><td>12\%</td><td>20\%</td></tr><tr><td>Covariance, Cov(rD, rE)</td><td colspan="2">72</td></tr><tr><td>Correlation coefficient, ρDE</td><td colspan="2">0.30</td></tr></table>

Portfolios of two risky assets are relatively easy to analyze, and they illustrate the principles that apply to portfolios of many assets. It makes sense to think about a two-asset risky portfolio as an asset allocation decision, and so we consider two mutual funds, a bond portfolio specializing in long-term debt securities, denoted  $D$ , and a stock fund that specializes in equity securities,  $E$ . Table 7.1 lists the parameters describing the rate-of-return distribution of these funds.

A proportion denoted by  $w_{D}$  is invested in the bond fund, and the remainder,  $1 - w_{D}$ , denoted  $w_{E}$ , is invested in the stock fund. The rate of return on this portfolio,  $r_{p}$ , is a weighted average of the returns on the component securities, with portfolio proportions as weights:

$$ r _ {p} = w _ {D} r _ {D} + w _ {E} r _ {E} \tag {7.1}
$$ where  $r_D$  is the rate of return on the debt fund and  $r_E$  is the rate of return on the equity fund.


The expected return on the portfolio is similarly a weighted average of expected returns on the component securities:

$$
E \left(r _ {p}\right) = w _ {D} E \left(r _ {D}\right) + w _ {E} E \left(r _ {E}\right) \tag {7.2}
$$

The variance of  $r_p$  is

$$
\sigma_ {p} ^ {2} = w _ {D} ^ {2} \sigma_ {D} ^ {2} + w _ {E} ^ {2} \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} + 2 w _ {D} w _ {E} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D}, r _ {E}\right) \tag {7.3}
$$

Our first observation is that the variance of the portfolio, unlike the expected return, is not a weighted average of the individual asset variances. To understand the formula for the portfolio variance more clearly, recall that the covariance of a variable with itself is the variance of that variable; that is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D}, r _ {D}\right) = \sum_ {\text {s c e n a r i o s}} \Pr (\text {s c e n a r i o}) \left[ r _ {D} - E \left(r _ {D}\right) \right] \left[ r _ {D} - E \left(r _ {D}\right) \right] \\ = \sum_ {\text {s c e n a r i o s}} \Pr (\text {s c e n a r i o}) \left[ r _ {D} - E \left(r _ {D}\right) \right] ^ {2} \tag {7.4} \\ = \sigma_ {D} ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

Therefore, another way to write the variance of the portfolio is

$$
\sigma_ {p} ^ {2} = w _ {D} w _ {D} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D}, r _ {D}\right) + w _ {E} w _ {E} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {E}, r _ {E}\right) + 2 w _ {D} w _ {E} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D}, r _ {E}\right) \tag {7.5}
$$

In words, the variance of the portfolio is a weighted sum of covariances, and each weight is the product of the portfolio proportions of the pair of assets.

Table 7.2 shows how portfolio variance can be calculated from a spreadsheet. Panel A shows the bordered covariance matrix of the returns of the two mutual funds. The bordered

<table><tr><td colspan="3">A. Bordered Covariance Matrix</td></tr><tr><td>Portfolio Weights</td><td>WD</td><td>WE</td></tr><tr><td>WD</td><td>Cov(rD, rD)</td><td>Cov(rD, rE)</td></tr><tr><td>WE</td><td>Cov(rE, rD)</td><td>Cov(rE, rE)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">B.

# Table 7.2

Computation of portfolio variance from the covariance matrix matrix is the covariance matrix with the portfolio weights for each fund placed on the borders, that is, along the first row and column. To find portfolio variance, multiply each element in the covariance matrix by the pair of portfolio weights in its row and column borders. Add up the resultant terms, and you have the formula for portfolio variance given in Equation 7.5.


We perform these calculations in Panel B, which is the border-multiplied covariance matrix: Each covariance has been multiplied by the weights from the row and the column in the borders. The bottom line of Panel B confirms that the sum of all the terms in this matrix (which we obtain by adding up the column sums) is indeed the portfolio variance in Equation 7.5.

This procedure works because the covariance matrix is symmetric around the diagonal, that is,  $\operatorname{Cov}(r_D, r_E) = \operatorname{Cov}(r_E, r_D)$ . Thus, each covariance term appears twice.

This procedure for computing the variance of a portfolio applies to any number of assets. Example 7.1 applies it to a three-asset portfolio.

# Example 7.1 Volatility of a Three-Asset Portfolio

The following table shows the weights of a portfolio invested in stocks  $X, Y, Z$  (in bold) along with the covariances between the returns on each of those stocks.

<table><tr><td>Weights</td><td>wx= .10</td><td>wY= .30</td><td>wZ= .40</td></tr><tr><td>wx= .10</td><td>26.25</td><td>8.91</td><td>5.52</td></tr><tr><td>wY= .30</td><td>8.91</td><td>15.98</td><td>12.16</td></tr><tr><td>wZ= .40</td><td>5.52</td><td>12.16</td><td>9.38</td></tr></table>

The portfolio variance is found by adding up each of the nine elements in the covariance matrix, first multiplying each element by the weights found in the respective row and column borders. We work across each row of the covariance matrix in turn:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {V a r} (r _ {p}) = . 1 0 \times . 1 0 \times 2 6. 2 5 + . 1 0 \times . 3 0 \times 8. 9 1 + . 1 0 \times . 4 0 \times 5. 5 2 [ \mathrm {r o w} 1 ] \\ + . 3 0 \times . 1 0 \times 8. 9 1 + . 3 0 \times . 3 0 \times 1 5. 9 8 + . 3 0 \times . 4 0 \times 1 2. 1 6 [ r o w 2 ] \\ + . 4 0 \times . 1 0 \times 5. 5 2 + . 4 0 \times . 3 0 \times 1 2. 1 6 + . 4 0 \times . 4 0 \times 9. 3 8 [ r o w 3 ] \\ = 7. 0 9 6 \\ \end{array}
$$

Concept Check 7.1 asks you to explore the bordered covariance matrix a bit further.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/300f0131da05a5cf8bd3ef88b9679e8549cfec1238d513a60c6368115d56b081.jpg)

# Concept Check 7.1 a. First confirm for yourself that our simple rule for computing the variance of a two-asset portfolio from the bordered covariance matrix is consistent with Equation 7.3.

b. Return to Example 7.1. What would be the variance of a portfolio invested in stocks  $X$ ,  $Y$ , and  $Z$  from Example 7.1 with weights .20, .30, and .50 respectively?

Equation 7.3 reveals that variance is reduced if the covariance term is negative. But even if the covariance term is positive, the portfolio standard deviation is still less than the weighted average of the individual security standard deviations, unless the two securities are perfectly positively correlated.

To see this, notice that the covariance can be computed from the correlation coefficient,  $\rho_{DE}$ , as

$$
\operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D}, r _ {E}\right) = \rho_ {D E} \sigma_ {D} \sigma_ {E} \tag {7.6}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\sigma_ {p} ^ {2} = w _ {D} ^ {2} \sigma_ {D} ^ {2} + w _ {E} ^ {2} \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} + 2 w _ {D} w _ {E} \sigma_ {D} \sigma_ {E} \rho_ {D E} \tag {7.7}
$$

Other things equal, portfolio variance is higher when  $\rho_{DE}$  is higher. In the case of perfect positive correlation,  $\rho_{DE} = 1$ , the right-hand side of Equation 7.7 is a perfect square and simplifies to

$$
\sigma_ {p} ^ {2} = \left(w _ {D} \sigma_ {D} + w _ {E} \sigma_ {E}\right) ^ {2} \tag {7.8}
$$ or


$$
\sigma_ {p} = w _ {D} \sigma_ {D} + w _ {E} \sigma_ {E} \tag {7.9}
$$

Therefore, in this special case, with perfect positive correlation (and only in this case), the standard deviation of the portfolio is just the weighted average of the component standard deviations. In all other cases, the correlation coefficient is less than 1, making the portfolio standard deviation less than that weighted average.

A hedge asset has negative correlation with the other assets in the portfolio. Equation 7.7 shows that such assets are particularly effective in reducing total risk because the last term in that equation will be negative. Moreover, Equation 7.2 shows that expected return is unaffected by correlation between returns. Therefore, other things equal, we will always prefer to add to our portfolios assets with low or, even better, negative correlation with our existing position.

Because the portfolio's expected return is the weighted average of its component expected returns, whereas its standard deviation is less than the weighted average of the component standard deviations, portfolios of less than perfectly correlated assets always offer some degree of diversification benefit. The lower the correlation, the greater the benefit.

How low can portfolio standard deviation be? The lowest possible value of the correlation coefficient is  $-1$ , representing perfect negative correlation. In this case, Equation 7.7 again simplifies to a perfect square, and

$$
\sigma_ {p} ^ {2} = \left(w _ {D} \sigma_ {D} - w _ {E} \sigma_ {E}\right) ^ {2} \tag {7.10}
$$

The portfolio standard deviation is

$$
\sigma_ {p} = \text {A b s o l u t e v a l u e} \left(w _ {D} \sigma_ {D} - w _ {E} \sigma_ {E}\right) \tag {7.11}
$$

When  $\rho = -1$ , a perfectly hedged position can be obtained by choosing the portfolio proportions to solve

$$ w _ {D} \sigma_ {D} - w _ {E} \sigma_ {E} = 0
$$

Solving, we find that the portfolio weights that drive standard deviation to zero are

$$ w _ {D} = \frac {\sigma_ {E}}{\sigma_ {D} + \sigma_ {E}} \tag {7.12}
$$

$$ w _ {E} = \frac {\sigma_ {D}}{\sigma_ {D} + \sigma_ {E}} = 1 - w _ {D}
$$

Given this background, we can experiment with different portfolio proportions to observe the effect on expected return and variance. We begin with an example of the calculations we will use in this analysis.

# Example 7.2 Portfolio Risk and Return

We can apply our formulas for expected return and standard deviation to the bond and stock funds whose properties were summarized in Table 7.1. Using these data, the expected return, variance, and standard deviation of the portfolio as a function of the portfolio weights are

$$
E (r _ {p}) = 8 w _ {D} + 1 3 w _ {E}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {p} ^ {2} = 1 2 ^ {2} w _ {D} ^ {2} + 2 0 ^ {2} w _ {E} ^ {2} + 2 \times 1 2 \times 2 0 \times . 3 \times w _ {D} w _ {E} \\ = 1 4 4 w _ {D} ^ {2} + 4 0 0 w _ {E} ^ {2} + 1 4 4 w _ {D} w _ {E} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {p} = \sqrt {\sigma_ {p} ^ {2}}
$$

The expected return of the portfolio for different proportions invested in bonds versus stocks is tabulated in Table 7.3 (see column for  $\rho = .30$ ), and plotted in Figure 7.3. When the proportion invested in debt varies from zero to 1 (so that the proportion in equity varies from 1 to zero), the portfolio expected return goes from  $13\%$  (the stock fund's expected return) to  $8\%$  (the expected return on bonds).

Figure 7.3 Portfolio expected return as a function of investment proportions

What happens when  $w_{D} > 1$  and  $w_{E} < 0$ ? The negative weight  $w_{E}$  implies that the equity fund is sold short, with proceeds of the short sale invested in the debt fund. This reduces the expected return of the portfolio. For example, when  $w_{D} = 2$  and  $w_{E} = -1$ , expected portfolio return falls to  $E(r_{p}) = 2 \times 8 + (-1) \times 13 = 3\%$ . At this point, the value of the bond fund in the portfolio is twice the net worth of the account. This extreme position is financed in part by short-selling stocks equal in value to the portfolio's net worth.

Figure 7.4 Portfolio standard deviation as a function of investment proportions


The reverse happens when  $w_{D} < 0$  and  $w_{E} > 1$ . This strategy calls for selling the bond fund short and using the proceeds to finance additional purchases of the equity fund.

Of course, varying investment proportions also has an effect on portfolio standard deviation. Table 7.3 presents portfolio standard deviations for different portfolio weights calculated from Equation 7.7 using the assumed value of the correlation coefficient, .30, as well as other values of  $\rho$ . Figure 7.4 shows the relationship between standard deviation and portfolio weights. Look first at the solid colored curve for  $\rho_{DE} = .30$ . The graph shows that as the portfolio weight in the equity fund increases from -.5 to 1.5, portfolio standard deviation first falls with the initial diversification from bonds into stocks, but then rises again as the portfolio becomes heavily concentrated in stocks, and again is undiversified. This pattern will generally hold as long as the correlation coefficient between the funds is not too high. For a pair of assets with a large positive correlation of returns, the portfolio standard deviation will increase monotonically from the low-risk asset to the high-risk asset. Even in this case, however, there is a positive (if small) benefit from diversification.


What is the minimum level to which portfolio standard deviation can be held? For the parameter values stipulated in Table 7.1, the portfolio weights that solve this minimization problem turn out to be

$$
\begin{array}{l} w _ {\operatorname {M i n}} (D) = . 8 2 \\ w _ {\mathrm {M i n}} (E) = 1 -. 8 2 = . 1 8 \\ \end{array}
$$

This minimum-variance portfolio has a standard deviation of

$$
\sigma_ {\text {Min}} = \left[ \left(0.2 ^ {2} \times 1 2 ^ {2}\right) + \left(0.8 ^ {2} \times 1 2 ^ {2}\right) + \left(2 \times 0.8 ^ {2} \times 1 2 ^ {2}\right) \right] ^ {1 / 2} = 1 1.45 \%
$$ as indicated in the last line of Table 7.3 for the column  $\rho = .30$ .


The solid colored line in Figure 7.4, which plots the portfolio standard deviation for  $\rho = .30$ , passes through the two undiversified portfolios of  $w_{D} = 1$  and  $w_{E} = 1$ . Notice that the minimum-variance portfolio has a standard deviation smaller than that of either of the individual component assets. This illustrates the power of diversification to limit risk.

The other three lines in Figure 7.4 show how portfolio risk varies for other values of the correlation coefficient, holding the variances of each asset constant. These lines plot the values in the other three columns of Table 7.3.

The solid dark straight line connecting the undiversified portfolios of all bonds or all stocks,  $w_{D} = 1$  or  $w_{E} = 1$ , shows portfolio standard deviation with perfect positive correlation,  $\rho = 1$ . In this case, there is no advantage from diversification, and the portfolio standard deviation is simply the weighted average of the component asset standard deviations.

The dashed colored curve depicts portfolio risk for uncorrelated assets,  $\rho = 0$ . With lower correlation between the two assets, diversification is more effective and portfolio risk is lower (at least when both assets are held in positive amounts). The minimum portfolio standard deviation when  $\rho = 0$  is  $10.29\%$  (see Table 7.3), again lower than the standard deviation of either asset.

Finally, the triangular broken line illustrates the perfect hedge potential when the two assets are perfectly negatively correlated ( $\rho = -1$ ). In this case, the solution for the minimum-variance portfolio is, by Equation 7.12,

$$
\begin{array}{l} w _ {\text {M i n}} (D; \rho = - 1) = \frac {\sigma_ {E}}{\sigma_ {D} + \sigma_ {E}} = \frac {2 0}{1 2 + 2 0} = . 6 2 5 \\ w _ {\operatorname {M i n}} (E; \rho = - 1) = 1 -. 6 2 5 = . 3 7 5 \\ \end{array}
$$ and the portfolio variance (and standard deviation) is zero.


$$ w _ {\mathrm {M i n}} (D) = \frac {\sigma_ {E} ^ {2} - \operatorname {C o v} (r _ {D} , r _ {E})}{\sigma_ {D} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} - 2 \operatorname {C o v} (r _ {D} , r _ {E})}
$$

Alternatively, with a spreadsheet program such as Excel, you can obtain an accurate solution by using the Solver to minimize the variance. See Appendix A for an example of a portfolio optimization spreadsheet.

Figure 7.5 Portfolio expected return as a function of standard deviation

We can combine Figures 7.3 and 7.4 to demonstrate the relationship between portfolio risk (standard deviation) and expected return—given the parameters of the available assets. This is done in Figure 7.5. For any pair of investment proportions,  $w_{D}$  and  $w_{E}$ , we read the expected return from Figure 7.3 and the standard deviation from Figure 7.4. The resulting pairs of expected return and standard deviation are tabulated in Table 7.3 and plotted in Figure 7.5.

The solid curved line in Figure 7.5 shows the portfolio opportunity set for  $\rho = .30$ . We call it the portfolio opportunity set because it shows all combinations of portfolio expected return and standard deviation that can be constructed from the two available assets. The other lines show the portfolio opportunity set for other values of the correlation coefficient. The straight dotted line connecting the two funds shows that there is no benefit from diversification when the correlation between the two is perfectly positive ( $\rho = 1$ ). The opportunity set is not "pushed" to the northwest. The dashed colored line demonstrates the greater benefit from diversification when the correlation coefficient is less than .30.

Finally, for  $\rho = -1$ , the portfolio opportunity set reveals the maximum advantage from diversification. In this case, there is a perfect hedging opportunity: Standard deviation can be driven all the way to zero.

To summarize, although the expected return of any portfolio is simply the weighted average of the asset expected returns, this is not true of the standard deviation. Potential benefits from diversification arise when correlation is less than perfectly positive. The lower the correlation, the greater the potential benefit from diversification. In the extreme case of perfect negative correlation, we have a perfect hedging opportunity and can construct a zero-variance portfolio.

Suppose now an investor wishes to select the optimal portfolio from the opportunity set. The best portfolio will depend on risk aversion. Portfolios to the northeast in Figure 7.5 provide higher rates of return but impose greater risk. The best trade-off among these choices is a matter of personal preference. Investors with greater risk aversion will prefer portfolios to the southwest, with lower expected return but lower risk.

Given a level of risk aversion, one can determine the portfolio that provides the highest level of utility. Recall from Chapter 6 that we were able to describe the utility provided by a portfolio as a function of its expected return,  $E(r_{p})$ , and its variance,  $\sigma_p^2$ , according to the relationship  $U = E(r_{p}) - 0.5A\sigma_{p}^{2}$ . The portfolio mean and variance are determined by the portfolio weights in the two funds,  $w_{E}$  and  $w_{D}$ , according to Equations 7.2 and 7.3. Using those equations and some calculus, we find the optimal investment proportions in the two funds. A warning: To use the following equation (or any equation involving the risk aversion parameter,  $A$ ), you must express returns in decimal form.

$$ w _ {D} = \frac {E (r _ {D}) - E (r _ {E}) + A (\sigma_ {E} ^ {2} - \sigma_ {D} \sigma_ {E} \rho_ {D E})}{A (\sigma_ {D} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} - 2 \sigma_ {D} \sigma_ {E} \rho_ {D E})}
$$

$$ w _ {E} = 1 - w _ {D}
$$

Here, too, Excel's Solver or similar software can be used to maximize utility subject to the constraints of Equations 7.2 and 7.3, plus the portfolio constraint that  $w_{D} + w_{E} = 1$  (i.e., that portfolio weights sum to 1).

# Concept Check 7.2

Compute and draw the portfolio opportunity set for the debt and equity funds when the correlation coefficient between them is  $\rho = .25$ .

# 7.3 Asset Allocation with Stocks, Bonds, and Bills

When choosing their capital allocation between risky and risk-free portfolios, investors naturally will want to work with the risky portfolio that offers the highest reward-to-volatility or Sharpe ratio. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the greater the expected return corresponding to any level of volatility. Another way to put this is that the best risky portfolio is the one that results in the steepest capital allocation line (CAL). Steeper CALs provide greater rewards for bearing any level of risk. Therefore, our next step is the construction of a risky portfolio combining the major asset classes (here a bond and a stock fund) that provides the highest possible Sharpe ratio.

The Sharpe ratio is the portfolio's risk premium in excess of the risk-free rate, divided by the standard deviation. We often will refer to T-bills as the risk-free asset, but you can think more generally about a money market portfolio playing that role. Before beginning, we point out that restricting ourselves in this example to only stocks, bonds, and bills is actually not as restrictive as it may appear, as this choice includes all three major asset classes.

# Asset Allocation with Two Risky Asset Classes

What if our risky assets are still confined to the bond and stock funds, as in the last section, but we can now also invest in risk-free T-bills yielding  $5\%$ ? We start with a graphical solution. Figure 7.6 shows the opportunity set using the data from Table 7.1 and assuming that  $\rho = .3$ .


Two possible CALs are drawn from the risk-free rate  $(r_f = 5\%)$  to two feasible portfolios. The first possible CAL is drawn through the minimum-variance portfolio  $A$ , which invested  $82\%$  in bonds and  $18\%$  in stocks (Table 7.3, bottom panel, last column). Portfolio  $A$ 's expected return is  $8.90\%$ , and its standard deviation is  $11.45\%$ . With a T-bill rate of  $5\%$ , its Sharpe ratio, which is the slope of the CAL, is

$$
S _ {A} = \frac {E \left(r _ {A}\right) - r _ {f}}{\sigma_ {A}} = \frac {8 . 9 - 5}{1 1 . 4 5} = . 3 4
$$

Now consider the CAL that uses portfolio  $B$  instead of  $A$ . Portfolio  $B$  invests  $70\%$  in bonds and  $30\%$  in stocks. Its expected return is  $9.5\%$ , and its standard deviation is  $11.70\%$ . Thus, the Sharpe ratio for portfolio  $B$  is

$$
S _ {B} = \frac {9 . 5 - 5}{1 1 . 7} = . 3 8
$$ which is higher than the Sharpe ratio provided by the minimum-variance portfolio. Hence, portfolio

Figure 7.7 The opportunity set of the debt and equity funds with the optimal CAL and the optimal risky portfolio

$B$  dominates  $A$ : Figure 7.6 shows that  $\mathrm{CAL}_B$  provides a higher expected return than  $\mathrm{CAL}_A$  for any level of standard deviation.

But why stop at portfolio  $B$ ? We can continue to ratchet the CAL upward to the greatest extent possible, which is where it ultimately reaches the point of tangency with the investment opportunity set. This yields the CAL with the highest feasible Sharpe ratio. Therefore, the tangency portfolio, labeled  $P$  in Figure 7.7, is the optimal risky portfolio to mix with T-bills. We can read its expected return and standard deviation from the graph in Figure 7.7:  $E(r_{P}) = 11\%$  and  $\sigma_{P} = 14.2\%$ .

In practice, when we try to construct optimal risky portfolios from more than two risky assets, we need to rely on a spreadsheet (which we present in Appendix A) or another computer program. To start, however, we will demonstrate the solution of the portfolio construction problem with only two risky assets and a risk-free asset. In this simpler case, we can find an explicit formula for the weights of each asset in the optimal portfolio, making it easier to illustrate general issues.

The objective is to find the weights  $w_{D}$  and  $w_{E}$  that result in the highest slope of the CAL. Thus, our objective function is the Sharpe ratio:

$$
S _ {p} = \frac {E (r _ {p}) - r _ {f}}{\sigma_ {p}}
$$

For the portfolio with two risky assets, the expected return and standard deviation of portfolio  $P$  are

$$
\begin{array}{l} E (r _ {p}) = w _ {D} E (r _ {D}) + w _ {E} E (r _ {E}) \\ = 8 w _ {D} + 1 3 w _ {E} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {p} = \left[ w _ {D} ^ {2} \sigma_ {D} ^ {2} + w _ {E} ^ {2} \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} + 2 w _ {D} w _ {E} \operatorname {C o v} (r _ {D}, r _ {E}) \right] ^ {1 / 2} \\ = \left[ 1 4 4 w _ {D} ^ {2} + 4 0 0 w _ {E} ^ {2} + (2 \times w _ {D} w _ {E} \times 7 2) \right] ^ {1 / 2} \\ \end{array}
$$

When we maximize the objective function,  $S_{p}$ , we have to satisfy the constraint that the portfolio weights sum to 1.0. Therefore, we solve an optimization problem formally written as

$$
\operatorname * {M a x} _ {w _ {i}} S _ {p} = \frac {E (r _ {p}) - r _ {f}}{\sigma_ {p}}
$$ subject to  $w_{D} + w_{E} = 1$ . This is a maximization problem that can be solved using standard tools of calculus.


In the case of two risky assets, the weights of the optimal risky portfolio,  $P$ , are given by Equation 7.13. Notice that the solution employs excess returns (denoted  $R$ ) rather than total returns (denoted  $r$ ).

$$ w _ {D} = \frac {E \left(R _ {D}\right) \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} - E \left(R _ {E}\right) \operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {D} , R _ {E}\right)}{E \left(R _ {D}\right) \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} + E \left(R _ {E}\right) \sigma_ {D} ^ {2} - \left[ E \left(R _ {D}\right) + E \left(R _ {E}\right) \right] \operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {D} , R _ {E}\right)} \tag {7.13}
$$

$$ w _ {E} = 1 - w _ {D}
$$

# Example 7.3 Optimal Risky Portfolio

Using our data, the solution for the optimal risky portfolio is

$$ w _ {D} = \frac {(8 - 5) 4 0 0 - (1 3 - 5) 7 2}{(8 - 5) 4 0 0 + (1 3 - 5) 1 4 4 - (8 - 5 + 1 3 - 5) 7 2} = . 4 0
$$

$$ w _ {E} = 1 -. 4 0 = . 6 0
$$

The expected return and standard deviation of this optimal risky portfolio are

$$
E (r _ {P}) = (. 4 \times 8) + (. 6 \times 1 3) = 1 1
$$

$$
\sigma_ {P} = \left[ (.4 ^ {2} \times 1 4 4) + (.6 ^ {2} \times 4 0 0) + (2 \times . 4 \times . 6 \times 7 2) \right] ^ {1 / 2} = 1 4. 2
$$

This asset allocation produces an optimal risky portfolio whose CAL has a slope (equivalently, Sharpe ratio) of

$$
S _ {P} = \frac {1 1 - 5}{1 4 . 2} = . 4 2
$$

In Chapter 6 we found the optimal complete portfolio given an optimal risky portfolio and the CAL generated by a combination of this portfolio and T-bills. Now that we have constructed the optimal risky portfolio,  $P$ , we can use its expected return and volatility along with the individual investor's degree of risk aversion,  $A$ , to calculate the optimal proportion of the complete portfolio to invest in it.

# Example 7.4 The Optimal Complete Portfolio

An investor with a coefficient of risk aversion  $A = 4$  would take a position in portfolio  $P$  of

$$ y = \frac {E \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f}}{A \sigma_ {P} ^ {2}} = \frac {. 1 1 -. 0 5}{4 \times . 1 4 2 ^ {2}} = . 7 4 3 9 \tag {7.14}
$$

Thus, the investor will invest  $74.39\%$  of overall wealth in portfolio  $P$  and  $25.61\%$  in T-bills. Portfolio  $P$  consists of  $40\%$  in bonds and  $60\%$  in equity (see Example 7.3), so the fraction of total wealth in bonds will be  $y w_{D} = .7439 \times .4 = .2976$ , or  $29.76\%$ . Similarly, the investment in stocks will be  $y w_{E} = .7439 \times .6 = .4463$ , or  $44.63\%$ . The graphical solution of this asset allocation problem is presented in Figures 7.8 and 7.9.

Figure 7.9 The proportions of the optimal complete portfolio

Once we have reached this point, generalizing to the case of many risky assets is straightforward. Before we move on, let us briefly summarize the steps we followed to arrive at the complete portfolio.

The accompanying spreadsheet can be used to analyze the return and risk of a portfolio of two risky assets. The model calculates expected return and volatility for varying weights of each security as well as the optimal risky and minimum-variance portfolios. Graphs are automatically generated for various model inputs. The model allows you to specify a target rate of return and solves for optimal complete portfolios composed of the risk-free asset and the optimal risky portfolio. The spreadsheet is constructed using the two-security return data (expressed as decimals, not percentages) from

Table 7.1. This spreadsheet is available in Connect or through your course instructor.

1. Specify the return characteristics of all securities (expected returns, variances, covariances).
2. Establish the risky portfolio (asset allocation): a. Calculate the optimal risky portfolio,  $P$  (Equation 7.13).

b. Calculate the properties of portfolio  $P$  using the weights determined in step (a) and Equations 7.2 and 7.3.

3. Allocate funds between the risky portfolio and the risk-free asset (capital allocation): a. Calculate the fraction of the complete portfolio allocated to portfolio  $P$  (the risky portfolio) and to T-bills (the risk-free asset) (Equation 7.14).

b. Calculate the share of the complete portfolio invested in each asset and in T-bills.

Recall that our two risky assets, the bond and stock mutual funds, are already diversified portfolios. The diversification within each of these portfolios must be credited for a good deal of the risk reduction compared to undiversified single securities. For example, the standard deviation of the rate of return on an average stock in the last 10 years has been about  $28\%$  (see Figure 7.2). In contrast, the standard deviation of the S&P 500 in this period was considerably lower, around  $17\%$ . This is evidence of the importance of diversification within each asset class.

# 7.4 The Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Model

# Security Selection

We can now generalize the portfolio construction problem to the case of many risky securities and a risk-free asset. As in the two risky assets example, the problem has three parts. First, we identify the risk-return combinations available from the set of risky assets. Next, we identify the optimal portfolio of risky assets by finding the portfolio weights that result in the steepest CAL. Finally, we choose an appropriate complete portfolio by mixing the risk-free asset with the optimal risky portfolio. Before describing the process in detail, let us first present an overview.

The first step is to determine the risk-return opportunities available to the investor. These are summarized by the minimum-variance frontier of risky assets. This frontier is a graph of the lowest possible variance that can be attained for a given portfolio expected return. Given the input data for expected returns, variances, and covariances, we can calculate the minimum-variance portfolio consistent with any targeted expected return. The plot of these expected return-standard deviation pairs is presented in Figure 7.10.

Notice that all the individual assets lie to the right inside the frontier, at least when we allow short sales in the construction of risky portfolios. The important lesson here is that risky portfolios comprising only a single asset are inefficient. Diversification allows us to construct portfolios with higher expected returns and lower standard deviations.

All the portfolios that lie on the minimum-variance frontier from the global minimum-variance portfolio and upward provide the best risk-return combinations and thus are candidates for the optimal portfolio. The portion of the frontier that lies above the global minimum-variance portfolio, therefore, is called the efficient frontier of risky assets. For any portfolio on the lower portion of the minimum-variance frontier, there is a portfolio with the same standard deviation and a greater expected return positioned directly above it. Hence, the bottom part of the minimum-variance frontier is inefficient.


The second part of the optimization plan involves the risk-free asset. As before, we search for the capital allocation line with the highest Sharpe ratio (i.e., the steepest slope), as shown in Figure 7.11.

The CAL generated by the optimal portfolio,  $P$ , is the one tangent to the efficient frontier. This CAL dominates all alternative feasible lines (the broken lines that are drawn through the frontier). Portfolio  $P$ , therefore, is the optimal risky portfolio.

Finally, in the last part of the problem, the individual investor chooses the appropriate mix between the optimal risky portfolio  $P$  and T-bills, exactly as in Figure 7.8.

Figure 7.10 The minimum-variance frontier of risky assets


Now, let us consider each part of the portfolio construction problem in more detail. In the first part of the problem, risk-return analysis, the portfolio manager needs as inputs a set of estimates for the expected returns of each security and a set of estimates for the covariance matrix. (In Part V, Security Analysis, we will examine the security valuation techniques and methods of financial analysis that analysts use. For now, we will assume that analysts already have spent the time and resources to prepare the inputs.)

The portfolio manager is now armed with the  $n$  estimates of  $E(r_{i})$  and the  $n \times n$  estimates of the covariance matrix in which the  $n$  diagonal elements are estimates of the variances  $\sigma_{i}^{2}$  and the  $n^2 - n = n(n - 1)$  off-diagonal elements are the estimates of the covariances between each pair of asset returns. (You can verify this from Table 7.2 for the case  $n = 2$ .) Each covariance appears twice in this table, so actually we have  $n(n - 1)/2$  different covariance estimates. If our portfolio management unit covers 50 securities, our security analysts need to deliver 50 estimates of expected returns, 50 estimates of variances, and  $50 \times 49/2 = 1,225$  different estimates of covariances. This is a daunting task! (We show later how the number of required estimates can be reduced substantially.)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/11646195dd45835f39d68d031ddc3903fd8087fc46289839847011fa34055e4c.jpg)
Figure 7.11 The efficient frontier of risky assets with the optimal CAL

Once these estimates are compiled, the expected return and variance of any risky portfolio with weights in each security,  $w_{i}$ , can be calculated from the bordered covariance matrix or, equivalently, from the following generalizations of Equations 7.2 and 7.3:

$$
E \left(r _ {p}\right) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} w _ {i} E \left(r _ {i}\right) \tag {7.15}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {p} ^ {2} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} w _ {i} w _ {j} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {i}, r _ {j}\right) \tag {7.16}
$$

It's clear that using Equations 7.15 and 7.16 will quickly become algebraically challenging as the number of risky assets increases. Fortunately, these equations, as well as the other components of the portfolio optimization, can be tackled using a spreadsheet or programming language. Appendix A walks you through the details in a seven-asset example using Excel. You can see there how the spreadsheet makes this otherwise-difficult problem quite manageable.

We mentioned earlier that the idea of diversification is age-old. The phrase "don't put all your eggs in one basket" existed long before modern portfolio theory. It was not until 1952, however, that Harry Markowitz published a formal model of portfolio selection embodying principles of efficient diversification, thereby paving the way for his 1990 Nobel Prize in Economics.[8] His model, now commonly called the Markowitz model, is precisely step one of portfolio management: the identification of the efficient set of portfolios, or the efficient frontier of risky assets.

The principal idea behind the frontier set of risky portfolios is that, for any risk level, we are interested only in that portfolio with the highest expected return. Alternatively, the frontier is the set of portfolios that minimizes variance for any target expected return.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/16157fc6e8909f3bc4c4e18c6e1bf35aee80d74b52605ae9c7ddd14174f00621.jpg)
Figure 7.12 The efficient portfolio set

Indeed, the two methods of computing the efficient set of risky portfolios are equivalent. To see this, consider the graphical representation of these procedures. The solid portion of the curve in Figure 7.12 shows the efficient frontier.

The points marked by squares are the result of a variance-minimization program. We first draw the constraints, that is, horizontal lines, at the level of required expected returns. We then look for the portfolio with the lowest standard deviation that plots on each horizontal line—in other words, we look for the portfolio that plots farthest to the left (smallest standard deviation) on that line. When we repeat this for many levels of required expected returns and "connect the dots," the shape of the minimum-variance frontier emerges. We then discard the bottom (dashed) half of the frontier because it is inefficient.

In the alternative approach, we draw a vertical line that represents the standard deviation constraint. We then consider all portfolios that plot on this line (have the same standard deviation) and choose the one with the highest expected return, that is, the portfolio that plots highest on this vertical line. Repeating this procedure for many vertical lines (levels of standard deviation) gives us the points marked by circles that trace the upper portion of the minimum-variance frontier, the efficient frontier.

When this step is completed, we have a list of efficient portfolios because the solution to the optimization program includes the portfolio proportions,  $w_{i}$ ; the expected return,  $E(r_{p})$ ; and the standard deviation,  $\sigma_{p}$ .

Let us restate what our portfolio manager has done so far. The estimates generated by the security analysts were transformed into a set of expected rates of return and a covariance matrix. These estimates are the input list, which is then fed into the optimization program.

Before we proceed to the second step of choosing the optimal risky portfolio from the frontier set, let us consider a practical point. Some clients may be subject to additional constraints. For example, many institutions are prohibited from taking short positions. For these clients, the portfolio manager will add to the optimization program constraints that rule out negative (short) positions. In this special case, it is possible that single assets may be, in and of themselves, efficient risky portfolios. For example, the asset with the highest expected return will be a frontier portfolio because, without the opportunity of short sales, the only way to obtain that rate of return is to hold the asset as one's entire risky portfolio.

Short-sale restrictions are by no means the only such constraints. For example, some clients may demand a minimal dividend yield from the optimal portfolio. In this case, the input list will be expanded to include the dividend yield of each stock, and the optimization program will include an additional constraint requiring the dividend yield of the portfolio to equal or exceed the desired level.

Another type of constraint is aimed at ruling out investments in industries or countries considered ethically or politically undesirable. This is referred to as socially responsible investing, or SRI. A similar orientation is called ESG (environmental, social, and governance-focused) investing. While these practices have considerable overlap, SRI investors tend to impose more absolute restrictions on portfolio choice to reflect their ethical concerns, whereas ESG investors tend to be comparatively more focused on long-term sustainable business prospects that might be enhanced by environmentally and socially sound practices.

Portfolio managers can tailor the efficient set to conform to any desire of the client. Of course, any constraint carries a price tag in the sense that an efficient frontier constructed subject to extra constraints will offer a Sharpe ratio inferior to that of a less constrained one. The client should be made aware of this cost and should carefully consider constraints that are not mandated by law.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/e19c76312b5fede61287f8dcf32cca249475829b2f74ac2f3c8d9995dbe8677b.jpg)
Figure 7.13 Capital allocation lines with various portfolios from the efficient set

# Capital Allocation and the Separation Property

Now that we have the efficient frontier, we proceed to step two and introduce the risk-free asset. Figure 7.13 shows the efficient frontier plus three CALs representing various portfolios from the efficient set. As before, we ratchet up the CAL by selecting different portfolios until we reach portfolio  $P$ , which is the tangency point of a line from  $F$  to the efficient frontier. Portfolio  $P$  maximizes the Sharpe ratio, the slope of the CAL from  $F$  to portfolios on the efficient frontier. At this point our portfolio manager is done. Portfolio  $P$  is the optimal risky portfolio for the manager's clients.

There is yet another way to find the best risky portfolio. In this approach, we ask the spreadsheet program to maximize the Sharpe ratio of portfolio  $P$ . The reason this is worth mentioning is that we can skip the charting of the efficient frontier altogether and proceed directly to find the portfolio that produces the steepest CAL. The program maximizes the Sharpe ratio with no constraint on expected return or variance (we use only the constraint that portfolio weights must sum to 1.0). Examination of Figure 7.13 shows that the solution strategy is to find the portfolio producing the highest slope of the CAL (Sharpe ratio) regardless of expected return or standard deviation. Expected return and standard deviation are easily computed from the optimal portfolio weights applied to the input list in Equations 7.15 and 7.16. While this last approach does not produce the entire minimum-variance frontier, in many applications, only the optimal risky portfolio is necessary.


This is a good time to ponder our results and their implementation. The most striking conclusion is that a portfolio manager will offer the same risky portfolio,  $P$ , to all clients regardless of their degree of risk aversion. The client's risk aversion comes into play only in capital allocation, the selection of the desired point along the CAL. Thus, the only difference between clients' choices is that the more risk-averse client will invest more in the risk-free asset and less in the optimal risky portfolio.

This result is called a separation property; it tells us that the portfolio choice problem may be separated into two independent tasks. The first task, determination of the optimal risky portfolio, is purely technical. Given the manager's input list, the best risky portfolio is the same for all clients, regardless of risk aversion. However, the second task, capital allocation, depends on personal preference. Here the client is the decision maker.

The crucial point is that the optimal portfolio  $P$  that the manager offers is the same for all clients. Put another way, investors with varying degrees of risk aversion would be satisfied with a universe of only two mutual funds: a money market fund for risk-free investments and a mutual fund that holds the optimal risky portfolio,  $P$ , on the tangency point

A spreadsheet model featuring optimal risky portfolios is available in Connect or through your course instructor. It contains a template similar to the template developed in this section. The model can be used to find optimal mixes of securities for targeted levels of returns for both restricted and unrestricted portfolios. Graphs of the efficient frontier are generated for each set of inputs. The example available at our Web site applies the model to portfolios constructed from equity indexes (called WEBS securities) of several countries.

This result makes professional management more efficient and hence less costly. One management firm can serve any number of clients with relatively small incremental administrative costs.


In practice, however, different managers will estimate different input lists, thus deriving different efficient frontiers, and offer different "optimal" portfolios to their clients. The source of the disparity lies in the security analysis. It is worth mentioning here that the universal rule of GIGO (garbage in-garbage out) also applies to security analysis. If the quality of the security analysis is poor, a passive portfolio such as a market index fund will result in a higher Sharpe ratio than an active portfolio that uses low-quality security analysis to tilt portfolio weights toward seemingly favorable (mispriced) securities.

One particular input list that would lead to a nearly worthless estimate of the efficient frontier is based on recent security average returns. If sample average returns over recent years are used as proxies for the future return on the security, the noise in those estimates will make the resultant efficient frontier virtually useless for portfolio construction.

Consider a stock with an annual standard deviation of  $30\%$ . Even if one were to use a 10-year average to estimate its expected return (and 10 years is almost ancient history in the life of a corporation), the standard deviation of that estimate would still be  $30 / \sqrt{10} = 9.5\%$ . Given this level of imprecision, the chances that the sample average represents expected returns for the coming year are negligible.[11]

As we have seen, optimal risky portfolios for different clients also may vary because of portfolio constraints such as dividend-yield requirements, tax considerations, or other client preferences. Nevertheless, this analysis suggests that a limited number of portfolios may be sufficient to serve the demands of a wide range of investors. This is the theoretical basis of the mutual fund industry.

# Concept Check 7.4

Suppose that two portfolio managers who work for competing investment management houses each employs a group of security analysts to prepare the input list for the Markowitz algorithm. When all is completed, it turns out that the efficient frontier obtained by portfolio manager  $A$  dominates that of manager  $B$ . By dominate, we mean that  $A$ 's optimal risky portfolio lies northwest of  $B$ 's. Hence, given a choice, investors will all prefer the risky portfolio that lies on the CAL of  $A$ .

a. What should be made of this outcome?
b. Should it be attributed to better security analysis by A's analysts?
c. Could it be that  $A$ 's computer program is superior?
d. Would you advise clients to periodically switch their money to the manager advertising the most northwesterly portfolio?

# The Power of Diversification

Section 7.1 introduced the concept of diversification and the limits to the benefits of diversification resulting from systematic risk. Given the tools we have developed, we can reconsider this intuition more rigorously and at the same time sharpen our insight regarding the power of diversification.

Equation 7.16, restated here, is the general formula for the variance of a portfolio composed of  $n$  risky assets:

$$
\sigma_ {p} ^ {2} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} w _ {i} w _ {j} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {i}, r _ {j}\right) \tag {7.16}
$$

Consider now the naïve diversification strategy in which an equally weighted portfolio is constructed, meaning that  $w_{i} = 1 / n$  for each security. In this case, Equation 7.16 may be rewritten as follows, where we break out the terms for which  $i = j$  into a separate sum, noting that  $\mathrm{Cov}(r_i,r_i) = \sigma_i^2$ :

$$
\sigma_ {p} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \frac {1}{n} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq i}} ^ {n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \frac {1}{n ^ {2}} \operatorname {Cov} \left(r _ {i}, r _ {j}\right) \tag{7.17}
$$

Notice that there are  $n$  variance terms and  $n(n - 1)$  covariance terms in Equation 7.17.

If we define the average variance and average covariance of the securities as

$$
\bar {\sigma} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} \tag {7.18}
$$

$$
\overline {{\operatorname {C o v}}} = \frac {1}{n (n - 1)} \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq i}} ^ {n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {i}, r _ {j}\right) \tag{7.19}
$$ we can express portfolio variance as


$$
\sigma_ {p} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{n} \bar {\sigma} ^ {2} + \frac {n - 1}{n} \overline {{\operatorname {C o v}}} \tag {7.20}
$$

Now examine the effect of diversification. When the average covariance among security returns is zero, as it would be if all risk were firm-specific, portfolio variance can be driven to zero. We see this from Equation 7.20. The second term on the right-hand side will be zero in this scenario, while the first term approaches zero as  $n$  becomes larger. Hence, when security returns are uncorrelated, the power of diversification to reduce portfolio risk is unlimited.

However, the more important case is the one in which economywide risk factors impart positive correlation among stock returns. In this case, as the portfolio becomes more highly diversified ( $n$  increases), portfolio variance remains positive. Although firm-specific risk, represented by the first term in Equation 7.20, approaches zero as diversification increases ( $n$  gets ever larger), the second term approaches  $\overline{\mathrm{Cov}}$ . [Note that  $(n - 1) / n$  approaches 1 for large  $n$ .] Thus, the risk of a highly diversified portfolio depends on the average covariance of the returns of the component securities, which in turn is a function of the importance of systematic factors in the economy.

To see further the fundamental relationship between systematic risk and security correlations, suppose for simplicity that all securities have a common standard deviation,  $\sigma$ , and all security pairs have a common correlation coefficient,  $\rho$ . Then the covariance between any pair of securities is  $\rho \sigma^2$ , and Equation 7.20 becomes

$$
\sigma_ {p} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{n} \sigma^ {2} + \frac {n - 1}{n} \rho \sigma^ {2} \tag {7.21}
$$

The effect of correlation is now explicit. When  $\rho = 0$ , we again obtain the insurance principle, where portfolio variance approaches zero as  $n$  becomes greater. For  $\rho > 0$ , however, portfolio variance remains positive. In fact, for  $\rho = 1$ , portfolio variance equals  $\sigma^2$  regardless of  $n$ , demonstrating that diversification is of no benefit: In the case of perfect correlation, all risk is systematic. More generally, as  $n$  becomes ever larger, Equation 7.21 shows that variance approaches  $\rho \sigma^2$ . We can think of this limit as the "systematic variance" of the security market.

Table 7.4 presents portfolio standard deviation as we include ever-greater numbers of securities in the portfolio for two cases,  $\rho = 0$  and  $\rho = .40$ . The table takes  $\sigma$  to be  $50\%$ .

# Table 7.4

Risk reduction of equally weighted portfolios in correlated and uncorrelated universes

As one would expect, portfolio risk is greater when  $\rho = .40$ . More surprising, perhaps, is that portfolio risk diminishes far less rapidly as  $n$  increases in the positive correlation case. The correlation among security returns limits the power of diversification.

For a 100-security portfolio (see the last two lines of Table 7.4), the standard deviation is  $5\%$  in the uncorrelated case—still significant compared to the potential of zero standard deviation. For  $\rho = .40$ , the standard deviation is high,  $31.86\%$ , yet it is very close to the undiversifiable systematic standard deviation in the infinite-sized security universe,  $\sqrt{\rho\sigma^2} = \sqrt{.4\times 50^2} = 31.62\%$ . At this point, further diversification is of little value.

Perhaps the most important insight from the exercise is this: When we hold diversified portfolios, the contribution to portfolio risk of a particular security will depend on the covariance of that security's return with those of other securities, and not on the security's variance. As we shall see in Chapter 9, this implies that equilibrium risk premiums will depend on covariances rather than total variability of returns.

# Concept Check 7.5

Suppose that the universe of available risky securities consists of a large number of stocks, identically distributed with  $E(r) = 15\%$ ,  $\sigma = 60\%$ , and a common correlation coefficient of  $\rho = .5$ .

a. What are the expected return and standard deviation of an equally weighted risky portfolio of 25 stocks?
b. What is the smallest number of stocks necessary to generate an efficient portfolio with a standard deviation equal to or smaller than  $43\%$ ?
c. What is the systematic risk in this security universe?
d. If T-bills are available and yield  $10\%$ , what is the slope of the CML? (Because of the symmetry assumed for all securities in the investment universe, the market index in this economy will be an equally weighted portfolio of all stocks.)

# Asset Allocation and Security Selection

As we have seen, the mathematical descriptions of security selection and asset allocation are identical. Both activities call for the construction of an efficient frontier and the choice of a particular portfolio from along that frontier. The determination of the optimal combination of securities proceeds in the same manner as the analysis of the optimal combination of asset classes. Why, then, does the investment community distinguish between asset allocation and security selection?

The answer probably lies in organizational efficiency. A large investment company is likely to invest both in domestic and international markets and in a broad set of asset classes, each of which requires specialized expertise. Hence, the management of each asset-class portfolio needs to be decentralized, and it becomes impossible to simultaneously optimize the entire organization's risky portfolio in one stage, although this would be prescribed as optimal on theoretical grounds.

Typical practice is, therefore, to optimize the security selection of each asset-class portfolio independently. At the same time, top management continually updates the asset allocation of the organization, adjusting the investment budget allotted to each asset-class portfolio.

# 7.5 Risk Pooling, Risk Sharing, and Time Diversification

So far, we have envisioned portfolio investment for "one period" but have been silent on how long that period may be. It might seem that we can take it to be of any length so that our analysis would apply equally to short-term as well as long-term investments. Yet many contend that investing over long periods of time provides "time diversification," that is, even though the market index may underperform bills in any particular year, the law of averages implies that because of its positive risk premium, the market will surely outperform bills over long investment periods. Therefore, they argue, longer-horizon investors can prudently allocate higher proportions of their portfolios to the market.

Is this a valid argument? It is not, but the question brings up subtle questions about how diversification works. In this last section, therefore, we reconsider the arguments underlying how diversification brings about risk reduction and then show why time diversification is based on a misinterpretation of the theory of portfolio diversification.

# Risk Sharing versus Risk Pooling

We begin by thinking about an insurance company selling many identical fire insurance policies. The payoff on any particular policy is a random amount,  \x , where the variance of  x  is  \sigma^2 . The company's total payout equals the sum of the payout on each individual policy,  \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i . One might think that if the firm sold  n  uncorrelated policies, it would diversify away practically all risk. But this argument is not quite right.

When the risk of a fire across different policy holders is uncorrelated, the variance of total payouts is just the sum of the individual policy variances (because all covariances are zero). Therefore,

$$
\operatorname {V a r} \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} x _ {i}\right) = n \sigma^ {2} \tag {7.22}
$$

In contrast, the variance of the average payoff across policies is

$$
\operatorname {V a r} \left(\frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} x _ {i}\right) = \frac {1}{n ^ {2}} \times n \sigma^ {2} = \frac {\sigma^ {2}}{n} \tag {7.23}
$$

The standard deviation of the average payoff is  $\sigma / \sqrt{n}$ . As the firm writes more and more policies,  $n$  increases and the uncertainty in the average payoff becomes progressively smaller, eventually approaching zero.

But is the insurance company's profit really getting safer? A few seconds of thought should convince you that this cannot possibly be the case. How can assuming exposure to an additional uncorrelated risky policy reduce risk? That would be like saying that a gambler who returns to the roulette table for one more spin is reducing his risk by diversifying across his many bets. His average payoff per bet may become more predictable, but the total amount won or lost must be more uncertain. Likewise, while the variance of the average insurance policy payoff decreases with the number of policies (Equation 7.23), the variance of the total payoff actually becomes more uncertain (Equation 7.22).

Thus, risk pooling, that is, pooling together many sources of independent risk sources, is only part of the business model of the insurance industry. An additional, essential part of the strategy is risk sharing.

To illustrate risk sharing, suppose that the insurance company sells  $n$  policies. Now the firm goes public and issues shares to investors. Let's say  $n$  investors each purchases one share of the company so that each owns  $1/n$  of the firm. As  $n$  increases, each investor's investment is unchanged: While there are more policies, that larger pool is shared with additional shareholders. With total payouts of  $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$ , the variance of each investor's exposure is  $\operatorname{Var}\left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\right) = \frac{1}{n^2} \times n \sigma^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$ , which does approach zero as  $n$  increases.

This calculation shows us that risk sharing is the essential complement to risk pooling. As more and more policies are pooled together, they are shared by ever-more investors, thus preventing any individual's total risk from growing with the number of policies. As more policies are added to the insured pool, each investor's exposure to any single policy shrinks. The law of averages does work—but you must make sure not to inadvertently scale up your bet as you "diversify" across many sources of risk.

This argument is also crucial for our understanding of diversification of stock portfolios. Diversifying a portfolio means dividing a fixed investment budget across many assets. We used this assumption throughout the chapter when we specified a fixed size of investor wealth and focused only on how to apportion that wealth across different assets. If a portfolio of  \$100,000 exclusively invested in Microsoft is to be diversified, that fixed\$ 100,000 must be divided between shares of Microsoft and shares of (let's say) Amazon as well as many other firms. An investor who currently has \$100,000 invested in Microsoft would not reduce total risk by adding another \$100,000 investment in Amazon. That would put more money at risk, just as selling more policies without spreading the exposure across more investors would increase, not decrease, the variance of insurance company returns. True diversification requires that the given investment budget be allocated across a large number of different assets, thus limiting the exposure to any particular security.

# Time Diversification

What does this analysis imply about time diversification and the risk of long-term investments? Think about a one-year investment in a stock index as analogous to a firm that sells one insurance policy. Extending your horizon to a second year is like selling a second policy. What does this do to your risk? Your average return per year may now be more predictable, but by putting your money at risk for an additional year, the uncertainty of your cumulative return surely increases. This is like an insurance company that engages in risk pooling, but not risk sharing. As it piles on more bets, risk must increase. It should be clear that longer horizons alone do not reduce risk.

True diversification means holding fixed the total funds put at risk, and then spreading exposure across multiple sources of uncertainty. In the context of extending the time horizon, this would require that a 2-year investor who puts funds at risk for two years instead of one would place only half as much in the stock market each year as a 1-year investor. This halves the exposure to each year's uncertain events, just as risk sharing with another investor would reduce each investor's exposure to each policy by half.

To illustrate the fallacy of time diversification, let's return to an example we encountered in Chapter 5, Table 5.6. We will assume that market returns are independent from year to year, with a mean annual return of  $5\%$  and standard deviation  $30\%$ . To simplify a bit, let's also assume the risk-free rate is zero, so the question of whether stocks outperform bills is equivalent to the question of whether the stock return is positive.

It also is helpful to use continuously compounded returns, which means that the total or cumulative return after  $n$  years is just the sum of the year-by-year continuously compounded returns, the variance of the cumulative return is  $n$  times the annual variance, and, therefore, the standard deviation is  $\sqrt{n}$  times the 1-year standard deviation. On the other hand, the standard deviation of the average return is  $1 / \sqrt{n}$  times the 1-year standard deviation. These are effectively the same relations that we found in Equations 7.22 and 7.23.

Table 7.5 shows the impact of investment horizon on risk. The mean return per year is .05 (line 1), so the expected total or cumulative return is .05 times the time horizon (line 2). The standard deviation of cumulative returns increases in proportion to the square root of the investment horizon, while the standard deviation of the average return falls with the square root of the horizon (lines 3 and 4). Because expected average return is fixed at  $5\%$  while standard deviation falls with the investment horizon, the probability that the average return will be positive increases as the time horizon extends. If we assume returns are normally distributed, we can calculate that probability exactly (line 5). The probability of a positive return approaches  $100\%$  as the investor's time horizon gets ever longer. This is the essence of the argument that time diversification reduces risk.

But probabilities do not tell the entire story. We also need to ask how bad performance can be in the event that it falls in the left tail of the distribution. Because the standard deviation of the total return increases with investment horizon (line 3), the magnitude of underperformance in the event of underperformance will be progressively worse. For example, the  $1\%$  VaR (value at risk) for the 1-year horizon entails a loss of  $47.7\%$  of invested funds, while the  $1\%$  VaR at a 30-year horizon is a catastrophic cumulative loss of  $90.2\%$  (line 7). Performance is even more extreme for the  $0.1\%$  VaR. Clearly, investment returns are not safer at long horizons, and time diversification is only an illusion.

# SUMMARY

1. The expected return of a portfolio is the weighted average of the component-security expected returns with investment proportions as weights.
2. The variance of a portfolio is the weighted sum of the elements of the covariance matrix using the products of the investment proportions as weights. Thus, the variance of each asset is weighted by the square of its investment proportion. The covariance of each pair of assets appears twice in the covariance matrix; thus, the portfolio variance includes twice each covariance weighted by the product of the investment proportions of each pair of assets.
3. Even if the covariances are positive, the portfolio standard deviation is less than the weighted average of the component standard deviations, as long as the assets are not perfectly positively correlated. Thus, portfolio diversification is beneficial as long as assets are less than perfectly correlated.
4. The greater an asset's covariance with the other assets in the portfolio, the more it contributes to portfolio variance. An asset that is perfectly negatively correlated with a portfolio can serve as a perfect hedge. That perfect hedge asset can reduce the portfolio variance to zero.
5. The efficient frontier shows the set of portfolios that maximize expected return for each level of portfolio risk. Rational investors will choose a portfolio on the efficient frontier.
6. A portfolio manager identifies the efficient frontier by first establishing estimates for asset expected returns and the covariance matrix. This input list is then fed into an optimization program that produces as outputs the investment proportions, expected returns, and standard deviations of the portfolios on the efficient frontier.
7. In practice, portfolio managers will arrive at different efficient portfolios because of differences in methods and quality of security analysis. Managers compete on the quality of their security analysis relative to their management fees.
8. If a risk-free asset is available and input lists are identical, all investors will choose the same portfolio on the efficient frontier of risky assets: the portfolio tangent to the CAL. All investors with identical input lists will hold an identical risky portfolio, differing only in how much each allocates to this optimal portfolio versus the risk-free asset. This result is characterized as the separation principle of portfolio construction.
9. Diversification is based on the allocation of a portfolio of fixed size across several assets, limiting the exposure to any one source of risk. Adding additional risky assets to a portfolio, thereby increasing the total amount invested, does not reduce dollar risk, even if it makes the rate of return more predictable. This is because that uncertainty is applied to a larger investment base. Nor does investing over longer horizons reduce risk. Increasing the investment horizon is analogous to investing in more assets. It increases total risk. Analogously, the key to the insurance industry is risk sharing—the spreading of many independent sources of risk across many investors, each of whom takes on only a small exposure to any particular source of risk.

The following data apply to CFA Problems 1 through 3: Hennessy & Associates manages a 30 million equity portfolio for the multimanager Wilstead Pension Fund. Jason Jones, financial vice president of Wilstead, noted that Hennessy had rather consistently achieved the best record among Wilstead's six equity managers. Performance of the Hennessy portfolio had been clearly superior to that of the S&P 500 in four of the past five years. In the one less-favorable year, the shortfall was trivial.

Hennessy is a "bottom-up" manager. The firm largely avoids any attempt to "time the market." It also focuses on selection of individual stocks, rather than the weighting of favored industries.

There is no apparent conformity of style among Wilstead's six equity managers. The five managers, other than Hennessy, manage portfolios aggregating 250 million made up of more than 150 individual issues.

Jones is convinced that Hennessy is able to apply superior skill to stock selection, but the favorable returns are limited by the high degree of diversification in the portfolio. Over the years, the portfolio generally held about 40 stocks, with about  $2\% -3\%$  of total funds committed to each issue. The reason Hennessy seemed to do well most years was that the firm was able to identify each year about 10 issues that registered particularly large gains.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/540d82509aac63ef86c74b84a185294121483981a770c242fdccb8e107f8f573.jpg)


On the basis of this overview, Jones outlined the following plan to the Wilstead pension committee:

Let's tell Hennessy to limit the portfolio to no more than 20 stocks. Hennessy will double the commitments to the stocks that it really favors, and eliminate the remainder. Except for this one new restriction, Hennessy should be free to manage the portfolio exactly as before.

All the members of the pension committee generally supported Jones's proposal because all agreed that Hennessy had seemed to demonstrate superior skill in selecting stocks. Yet the proposal was a considerable departure from previous practice, and several committee members raised questions. Respond to each of the following questions.

1.  $a$ . Will the limitation to 20 stocks likely increase or decrease the risk of the portfolio? Explain.
$b$ . Is there any way Hennessy could reduce the number of issues from 40 to 20 without significantly affecting risk? Explain.
2. One committee member was particularly enthusiastic concerning Jones's proposal. He suggested that Hennessy's performance might benefit further from reduction in the number of issues to 10. If the reduction to 20 could be expected to be advantageous, explain why reduction to 10 might be less likely to be advantageous. (Assume that Wilstead will evaluate the Hennessy portfolio independently of the other portfolios in the fund.)
3. Another committee member suggested that, rather than evaluate each managed portfolio independently of other portfolios, it might be better to consider the effects of a change in the Hennessy portfolio on the total fund. Explain how this broader point of view could affect the committee decision to limit the holdings in the Hennessy portfolio to either 10 or 20 issues.
4. Which one of the following portfolios cannot lie on the efficient frontier as described by Markowitz?

<table><tr><td></td><td>Portfolio</td><td>Expected Return (\%)</td><td>Standard Deviation (\%)</td></tr><tr><td>a.</td><td>W</td><td>15</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>b.</td><td>X</td><td>12</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>c.</td><td>Z</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>d.</td><td>Y</td><td>9</td><td>21</td></tr></table>

5. Which statement about portfolio diversification is correct?

$a$ . Efficient diversification can reduce or eliminate systematic risk.
b. Diversification reduces the portfolio's expected return because it reduces a portfolio's total risk.
c. As more securities are added to a portfolio, total risk typically can be expected to fall at a decreasing rate.
$d$ . The risk-reducing benefits of diversification do not occur meaningfully until at least 30 individual securities are included in the portfolio.

6. The measure of risk for a security held in a diversified portfolio is:

$a$  Specific risk.
$b$  Standard deviation of returns.
c. Reinvestment risk.
d. Covariance.

7. Portfolio theory as described by Markowitz is most concerned with:

$a$ . The elimination of systematic risk.
$b$ . The effect of diversification on portfolio risk.
$c$ . The identification of unsystematic risk.
$d$ . Active portfolio management to enhance return.

8. Assume that a risk-averse investor owning stock in Miller Corporation decides to add the stock of either Mac or Green Corporation to her portfolio. All three stocks offer the same expected return and total variability. The correlation of return between Miller and Mac is -.05 and between Miller and Green is  $+.05$ . Portfolio risk is expected to: a. Decline more when the investor buys Mac.

$b$ . Decline more when the investor buys Green.
$c$ . Increase when either Mac or Green is bought.
$d$ . Decline or increase, depending on other factors.

9. Stocks  $A$ ,  $B$ , and  $C$  have the same expected return and standard deviation. The following table shows the correlations between the returns on these stocks.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Stock A</td><td>Stock B</td><td>Stock C</td></tr><tr><td>Stock A</td><td>+1.0</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Stock B</td><td>+0.9</td><td>+1.0</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Stock C</td><td>+0.1</td><td>-0.4</td><td>+1.0</td></tr></table>

Given these correlations, the portfolio constructed from these stocks having the lowest risk is a portfolio:

$a$  .Equally invested in stocks  $A$  and  $B$
$b$  .Equally invested in stocks  $A$  and  $C$
$c$  .Equally invested in stocks  $B$  and  $C$
$d$ . Totally invested in stock  $C$ .

10. Statistics for three stocks,  $A$ ,  $B$ , and  $C$ , are shown in the following tables.

Standard Deviations of Returns

<table><tr><td>Stock:</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>Standard deviation (\%):</td><td>40</td><td>20</td><td>40</td></tr></table>

Using only the information provided in the tables, and given a choice between a portfolio made up of equal amounts of stocks  $A$  and  $B$  or a portfolio made up of equal amounts of stocks  $B$  and  $C$ , which portfolio would you recommend? Justify your choice.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Value</td><td>Percent of Total</td><td>Expected Annual Return</td><td>Annual Standard Deviation</td></tr><tr><td>Short-term bonds</td><td>\$ 200,000</td><td>10\%</td><td>4.6\%</td><td>1.6\%</td></tr><tr><td>Domestic large-cap equities</td><td>600,000</td><td>30</td><td>12.4</td><td>19.5</td></tr><tr><td>Domestic small-cap equities</td><td>1,200,000</td><td>60</td><td>16.0</td><td>29.9</td></tr><tr><td>Total portfolio</td><td>\$2,000,000</td><td>100\%</td><td>13.8</td><td>23.1</td></tr></table>

Stephenson soon expects to receive an additional 2 million and plans to invest the entire amount in an index fund that best complements the current portfolio. Stephanie Coppa, CFA, is evaluating the four index funds shown in the following table for their ability to produce a portfolio that will meet two criteria relative to the current portfolio: (1) maintain or enhance expected return and (2) maintain or reduce volatility.

Each fund is invested in an asset class that is not substantially represented in the current portfolio.

Index Fund Characteristics

<table><tr><td>Index Fund</td><td>Expected Annual Return</td><td>Expected Annual Standard Deviation</td><td>Correlation of Returns with Current Portfolio</td></tr><tr><td>Fund A</td><td>15\%</td><td>25\%</td><td>+0.80</td></tr><tr><td>Fund B</td><td>11</td><td>22</td><td>+0.60</td></tr><tr><td>Fund C</td><td>16</td><td>25</td><td>+0.90</td></tr><tr><td>Fund D</td><td>14</td><td>22</td><td>+0.65</td></tr></table>

Which fund should Coppa recommend to Stephenson? Justify your choice by describing how your chosen fund best meets both of Stephenson's criteria. No calculations are required.

12. Abigail Grace has a \$900,000 fully diversified portfolio. She subsequently inherits ABC Company common stock worth \$100,000. Her financial adviser provided her with the following estimates:

Risk and Return Characteristics

<table><tr><td></td><td>Expected Monthly Returns</td><td>Standard Deviation of Monthly Returns</td></tr><tr><td>Original Portfolio</td><td>0.67\%</td><td>2.37\%</td></tr><tr><td>ABC Company</td><td>1.25</td><td>2.95</td></tr></table>

The correlation coefficient of ABC stock returns with the original portfolio returns is .40.

$a$ . The inheritance changes Grace's overall portfolio, and she is deciding whether to keep the ABC stock. Assuming Grace keeps the ABC stock, calculate the: i. Expected return of her new portfolio, which includes the ABC stock.

ii. Covariance of ABC stock returns with the original portfolio returns.
iii. Standard deviation of her new portfolio, which includes the ABC stock.

b. If Grace sells the ABC stock, she will invest the proceeds in risk-free government securities yielding  $42\%$  monthly. Assuming Grace sells the ABC stock and replaces it with the government securities, calculate the i. Expected return of her new portfolio, which includes the government securities.

ii. Covariance of the government security returns with the original portfolio returns.
iii. Standard deviation of her new portfolio, which includes the government securities.

c. Determine whether the systematic risk of her new portfolio, which includes the government securities, will be higher or lower than that of her original portfolio.
d. On the basis of conversations with her husband, Grace is considering selling the  \$100,000 of ABC stock and acquiring\$ 100,000 of XYZ Company common stock instead. XYZ stock has the same expected return and standard deviation as ABC stock. Her husband comments, "It doesn't matter whether you keep all of the ABC stock or replace it with 100,000 of XYZ stock." State whether her husband's comment is correct or incorrect. Justify your response.
e. In a recent discussion with her financial adviser, Grace commented, "If I just don't lose money in my portfolio, I will be satisfied." She went on to say, "I am more afraid of losing money than I am concerned about achieving high returns."

i. Describe one weakness of using standard deviation of returns as a risk measure for Grace.
ii. Identify an alternate risk measure that is more appropriate under the circumstances.

13. Dudley Trudy, CFA, recently met with one of his clients. Trudy typically invests in a master list of 30 equities drawn from several industries. As the meeting concluded, the client made the following statement: "I trust your stock-picking ability and believe that you should invest my funds in your five best ideas. Why invest in 30 companies when you obviously have stronger opinions on a few of them?" Trudy plans to respond to his client within the context of modern portfolio theory.


a. Contrast the concepts of systematic risk and firm-specific risk, and give an example of each type of risk.
b. Critique the client's suggestion. Discuss how both systematic and firm-specific risk change as the number of securities in a portfolio is increased.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1.  $a$ . The first term will be  $w_{D} \times w_{D} \times \sigma_{D}^{2}$  because this is the element in the top corner of the matrix  $(\sigma_{D}^{2})$  times the term on the column border  $(w_{D})$  times the term on the row border  $(w_{D})$ . Applying this rule to each term of the covariance matrix results in the sum

$w_{D}^{2}\sigma_{D}^{2} + w_{D}w_{E}\operatorname{Cov}(r_{E},r_{D}) + w_{E}w_{D}\operatorname{Cov}(r_{D},r_{E}) + w_{E}^{2}\sigma_{E}^{2}$ , which is the same as Equation 7.3 because  $\operatorname{Cov}(r_E,r_D) = \operatorname{Cov}(r_D,r_E)$ .

b. Putting weights of .20, .30, and .50 respectively on the border of the covariance matrix, we find portfolio variance as

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {V a r} \left(r _ {p}\right) = . 2 0 \times . 2 0 \times 2 6. 2 5 + . 2 0 \times . 3 0 \times 8. 9 1 + . 2 0 \times . 5 0 \times 5. 5 2 \\ + . 3 0 \times . 2 0 \times 8. 9 1 + . 3 0 \times . 3 0 \times 1 5. 9 8 + . 3 0 \times . 5 0 \times 1 2. 1 6 \\ + . 5 0 \times . 2 0 \times 5. 5 2 + . 5 0 \times . 3 0 \times 1 2. 1 6 + . 5 0 \times . 5 0 \times 9. 3 8 \\ = 1 0. 6 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

2. The parameters of the opportunity set are  $E(r_{D}) = 8\%$ ,  $E(r_{E}) = 13\%$ ,  $\sigma_{D} = 12\%$ ,  $\sigma_{E} = 20\%$ , and  $\rho(D, E) = .25$ . From the standard deviations and the correlation coefficient, we generate the covariance matrix:

<table><tr><td>Fund</td><td>D</td><td>E</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>144</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>E</td><td>60</td><td>400</td></tr></table>

The global minimum-variance portfolio is constructed so that

$$
\begin{array}{l} w _ {D} = \frac {\sigma_ {E} ^ {2} - \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D} , r _ {E}\right)}{\sigma_ {D} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} - 2 \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D} , r _ {E}\right)} \\ = \frac {4 0 0 - 6 0}{(1 4 4 + 4 0 0) - (2 \times 6 0)} = . 8 0 1 9 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$ w _ {E} = 1 - w _ {D} = . 1 9 8 1
$$

Its expected return and standard deviation are

$$
\begin{array}{l} E \left(r _ {P}\right) = (. 8 0 1 9 \times 8) + (. 1 9 8 1 \times 1 3) = 8. 9 9 \\ \sigma_ {P} = \left[ w _ {D} ^ {2} \sigma_ {D} ^ {2} + w _ {E} ^ {2} \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} + 2 w _ {D} w _ {E} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D}, r _ {E}\right) \right] ^ {1 / 2} \\ = \left[ (. 8 0 1 9 ^ {2} \times 1 4 4) + (. 1 9 8 1 ^ {2} \times 4 0 0) + (2 \times . 8 0 1 9 \times . 1 9 8 1 \times 6 0) \right] ^ {1 / 2} \\ = 11.29 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

For the other points, we increase  $w_{D}$  from .10 to .90 in increments of .10; accordingly,  $w_{E}$  ranges from .90 to .10 in the same increments. We substitute these portfolio proportions in the formulas for expected return and standard deviation. Note that when  $w_{E} = 1.0$ , the portfolio parameters equal those of the stock fund; when  $w_{D} = 1$ , the portfolio parameters equal those of the debt fund.

We thus generate the following table:

<table><tr><td>wE</td><td>wD</td><td>E(r)</td><td>σ</td></tr><tr><td>0.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>8.0</td><td>12.00</td></tr><tr><td>0.1</td><td>0.9</td><td>8.5</td><td>11.46</td></tr><tr><td>0.2</td><td>0.8</td><td>9.0</td><td>11.29</td></tr><tr><td>0.3</td><td>0.7</td><td>9.5</td><td>11.48</td></tr><tr><td>0.4</td><td>0.6</td><td>10.0</td><td>12.03</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>0.5</td><td>10.5</td><td>12.88</td></tr><tr><td>0.6</td><td>0.4</td><td>11.0</td><td>13.99</td></tr><tr><td>0.7</td><td>0.3</td><td>11.5</td><td>15.30</td></tr><tr><td>0.8</td><td>0.2</td><td>12.0</td><td>16.76</td></tr><tr><td>0.9</td><td>0.1</td><td>12.5</td><td>18.34</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>13.0</td><td>20.00</td></tr><tr><td>0.1981</td><td>0.8019</td><td>8.99</td><td>11.29 minimum variance portfolio</td></tr></table>

You can now draw your graph.

3.  $a$ . The computations of the opportunity set of the stock and risky bond funds are like those of Question 2 and will not be shown here. You should perform these computations, however, in order to give a graphical solution to part  $a$ . Note that the covariance between the funds is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {A}, r _ {B}\right) = \rho (A, B) \times \sigma_ {A} \times \sigma_ {B} \\ = -. 2 \times 2 0 \times 6 0 = - 2 4 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

$b$ . The proportions in the optimal risky portfolio are given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} w _ {A} = \frac {(1 0 - 5) 6 0 ^ {2} - (3 0 - 5) (- 2 4 0)}{(1 0 - 5) 6 0 ^ {2} + (3 0 - 5) 2 0 ^ {2} - (1 0 - 5 + 3 0 - 5) (- 2 4 0)} \\ = . 6 8 1 8 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$ w _ {B} = 1 - w _ {A} = . 3 1 8 2
$$

The expected return and standard deviation of the optimal risky portfolio are

$$
\begin{array}{l} E \left(r _ {P}\right) = (. 6 8 1 8 \times 1 0) + (. 3 1 8 2 \times 3 0) = 1 6. 3 6 \\ \sigma_ {P} = \left\{\left(. 6 8 1 8 ^ {2} \times 2 0 ^ {2}\right) + \left(. 3 1 8 2 ^ {2} \times 6 0 ^ {2}\right) + \left[ 2 \times . 6 8 1 8 \times . 3 1 8 2 (- 2 4 0) \right] \right\} ^ {1 / 2} \\ = 21.13 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

Note that portfolio  $P$  is not the global minimum-variance portfolio. The proportions of the latter are given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} w _ {A} = \frac {6 0 ^ {2} - (- 2 4 0)}{6 0 ^ {2} + 2 0 ^ {2} - 2 (- 2 4 0)} = . 8 5 7 1 \\ w _ {B} = 1 - w _ {A} = . 1 4 2 9 \\ \end{array}
$$

With these proportions, the standard deviation of the minimum-variance portfolio is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma (\min ) = (. 8 5 7 1 ^ {2} \times 2 0 ^ {2}) + (. 1 4 2 9 ^ {2} \times 6 0 ^ {2}) + [ 2 \times . 8 5 7 1 \times . 1 4 2 9 \times (- 2 4 0) ] ^ {1 / 2} \\ = 17.75 \% \\ \end{array}
$$ which is less than that of the optimal risky portfolio.


c. The CAL is the line from the risk-free rate through the optimal risky portfolio. This line represents all efficient portfolios that combine T-bills with the optimal risky portfolio. The slope of the CAL is

$$
S = \frac {E \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f}}{\sigma_ {P}} = \frac {1 6 . 3 6 - 5}{2 1 . 1 3} = . 5 3 7 6
$$

$d$ . Given a degree of risk aversion,  $A$ , an investor will choose the following proportion,  $y$ , in the optimal risky portfolio (remember to express returns as decimals when using  $A$ ):

$$ y = \frac {E \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f}}{A \sigma_ {P} ^ {2}} = \frac {. 1 6 3 6 -. 0 5}{5 \times . 2 1 1 3 ^ {2}} = . 5 0 8 9
$$

This means that the optimal risky portfolio, with the given data, is attractive enough for an investor with  $A = 5$  to invest  $50.89\%$  of total wealth in it. Because stock  $A$  makes up  $68.18\%$  of the risky portfolio and stock  $B$  makes up  $31.82\%$ , the investment proportions for this investor are

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text{Stock A:} .5089 \times 68.18 = 34.70 \% \\ \text{Stock} B: .5089 \times 31.82 = 16.19 \% \\ \text {Total} \quad 50.89 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

4. Efficient frontiers derived by portfolio managers depend on forecasts of the rates of return on various securities and estimates of risk, that is, the covariance matrix. The forecasts themselves do not control outcomes. Thus, preferring managers with rosier forecasts (northwesterly frontiers) is tantamount to rewarding the bearers of good news and punishing the bearers of bad news. What we should do is reward bearers of accurate news. Thus, if you get a glimpse of the frontiers (forecasts) of portfolio managers on a regular basis, what you want to do is develop the track record of their forecasting accuracy and steer your advisees toward the more accurate forecaster. Their portfolio choices will, in the long run, outperform the field.

5. The parameters are  $E(r) = 15\%$ ,  $\sigma = 60\%$ , and the correlation between any pair of stocks is  $\rho = .5$ .

$a$ . The portfolio expected return is invariant to the size of the portfolio because all stocks have identical expected returns. The standard deviation of a portfolio with  $n = 25$  stocks is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {P} = \left[ \sigma^ {2} / n + \rho \times \sigma^ {2} (n - 1) / n \right] ^ {1 / 2} \\ = [ 60 ^ {2} / 25 + . 5 \times 60 ^ {2} \times 24 / 25 ] ^ {1 / 2} = 43.27 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

$b$ . Because the stocks are identical, efficient portfolios are equally weighted. To obtain a standard deviation of  $43\%$ , we need to solve for  $n$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} 4 3 ^ {2} = \frac {6 0 ^ {2}}{n} +. 5 \times \frac {6 0 ^ {2} (n - 1)}{n} \\ 1, 8 4 9 n = 3, 6 0 0 + 1, 8 0 0 n - 1, 8 0 0 \\ n = \frac {1 , 8 0 0}{4 9} = 3 6. 7 3 \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus, we need 37 stocks and will come in with volatility slightly under the target.

$c$ . As  $n$  gets very large, the variance of an efficient (equally weighted) portfolio diminishes, leaving only the variance that comes from the covariances among stocks. Therefore,

$$
\text{Systematic standard deviation} = \sqrt {\rho \times \sigma^ {2}} = \sqrt {. 5 \times 60 ^ {2}} = 42.43 \%
$$

Note that with 25 stocks we came within .84\% of the systematic risk, that is, the standard deviation of a portfolio of 25 stocks is only .84\% higher than 42.43\%. With 37 stocks, the standard deviation is 43.01\%, which is only .58\% greater than 42.43\%.

$d$ . If the risk-free rate is  $10\%$ , then the risk premium on any size portfolio is  $15 - 10 = 5\%$ . The standard deviation of a well-diversified portfolio is (practically)  $42.43\%$ ; hence, the slope of the CAL is

$$
S = 5 / 4 2. 4 3 = . 1 1 7 8
$$

# APPENDIX A: A Spreadsheet Model for Efficient Diversification

Several software packages can be used to generate the efficient frontier. We will demonstrate using Microsoft Excel. Excel is far from the best program for this purpose and is limited in the number of assets it can handle, but using it to work through a simple portfolio optimization can illustrate the approach used in more sophisticated "black-box" programs. You will find that even in Excel, the computation of the efficient frontier is not difficult.

We apply the Markowitz portfolio optimization program to the problem of international diversification. We take the perspective of a portfolio manager serving U.S. clients, who wishes to construct for the next year an optimal risky portfolio of large stocks in the U.S. and six developed capital markets (Japan, Germany, the U.K., France, Canada, and Australia). First, we describe the input list: forecasts of risk premiums and the covariance matrix. Next, we describe Excel's Solver, and finally we show the solution to the manager's problem.

# The Input List

The manager needs to compile an input list of expected returns, variances, and covariances. Spreadsheet 7A.1 shows the calculations.

Panel A lays out the expected excess return for each country index. While these estimates may be guided by historical experience, as we discussed in Chapter 5, using simple historical averages would yield extremely noisy estimates of expected risk premiums because returns are so volatile. Historical average returns fluctuate enormously across subperiods, making them highly unreliable estimators. Here, we simply assume the manager has arrived at some reasonable estimates of each country's risk premium through scenario analysis informed by historical experience. These values are presented in column B.

Panel B is the bordered covariance matrix corresponding to Table 7.2. The covariances in this table might reasonably be estimated from a sample of historical returns, as empirically based variance and covariance estimates are far more precise than corresponding estimates of mean returns. It would be common to estimate Panel B using perhaps five years of monthly returns. The Excel function COVARIANCE would compute the covariance between the time series of returns for any pair of countries. We assume the manager has already collected historical returns on each index, plugged each pair of returns into the COVARIANCE function, and obtained the entries that appear in Panel B. The elements on the diagonal of the covariance matrix in Panel B are the variances of each country index.

The covariance matrix in Panel B is bordered along the top (row 15) and left (column A) by a set of portfolio weights. You can start the procedure off using any arbitrary set of weights as long as they sum to 1. You will be asking Excel to replace these initial weights with the weights that correspond to the portfolios on the efficient frontier.

Cells C25, C26, and C27 calculate some important characteristics of the portfolio defined by the set of portfolio weights. C25 is the expected risk premium on the portfolio, computed by taking a weighted average of country risk premiums (using Excel's SUMPRODUCT function; the formula for cell C25 is presented in cell C35). Cell C26 computes the standard deviation of any portfolio using the formula developed in Table 7.2. Portfolio variance is given by the sum of cells C24-I24 below the bordered covariance matrix. Cell C26 takes the square root of this sum to produce the standard deviation. Finally C27 is the portfolio's Sharpe ratio, expected excess return divided by standard deviation. This is also the slope of the CAL (capital allocation line) that runs through the portfolio corresponding to the weights in column A. The optimal risky portfolio is the one that maximizes the Sharpe ratio.

Panel C shows the properties of several portfolios along the efficient frontier. The highlighted columns correspond to the minimum-variance and the tangency portfolios. Each column in the panel shows portfolio characteristics and the weighting in each country.

# Using Excel's Solver

Excel's Solver is a user-friendly, but quite powerful, optimizer. It has three parts: (1) an objective function, (2) decision variables, and (3) constraints. Figure 7A.1 shows three pictures of the Solver. We will begin by finding the minimum-variance portfolio. The problem is set up in Panel A of the figure.

The top line of the Solver lets you choose a target cell for the "objective function," that is, the variable you are trying to optimize. In Panel A of Figure 7A.1, the target cell is C26, the portfolio standard deviation. Below the target cell, you can choose whether your objective is to maximize, minimize, or set your objective function equal to a value that you specify. Here we choose to minimize the portfolio standard deviation.

The next part of Solver contains the decision variables. These are cells that the Solver can change in order to optimize the objective function in the target cell. Here, we input cells A17-A23, the portfolio weights that we select to minimize portfolio volatility.

The bottom panel of the Solver can include any number of constraints. One constraint that must always appear in portfolio optimization is the "feasibility constraint," namely, that portfolio weights sum to 1.0. When we bring up the dialogue box for constraints, we specify that cell A24 (the sum of weights) must be set equal to 1.0.

When we click "Solve," the Solver finds the weights of the minimum-variance portfolio and places them in column A. The spreadsheet then calculates the risk premium and standard deviation of that portfolio. We save the portfolio weights and its key statistics by copying them to Panel C in Spreadsheet 7A.1. Cell C42 in Panel C shows that the lowest standard deviation (SD) that can be achieved with our input list is  $11.32\%$ . This standard deviation is considerably lower than even the lowest SD of the individual indexes.

Now we are ready to find other points along the efficient frontier. We will do this by finding the portfolio that has the lowest possible variance for any targeted risk premium. You can produce the entire efficient frontier in minutes following this procedure.

1. Input to the Solver a constraint that says: Cell C25 (the portfolio risk premium) must equal some desired value, for example,. .04. The Solver at this point is shown in Panel B of Figure 7A.1. There are now two constraints: one for the required risk premium and one for the fact that portfolio weights must sum to 1. Ask Solver to

B solve, and it will replace the portfolio weights in column A with those corresponding to the portfolio that can achieve the targeted risk premium with the lowest possible standard deviation. This is the portfolio on the efficient frontier with a risk premium of  $4\%$ . Again, the spreadsheet calculates the other properties of this portfolio, which you then copy to Column D of Panel C. In Columns B-C, we use risk premiums ranging from .035 to .08 (row 41). Each column corresponds to one portfolio along the efficient frontier.


2. To find another point on the frontier, you input a different desired risk premium, and ask the Solver to solve again.
3. Every time the Solver gives you a solution to the request in (2), copy the results into Panel C, in this way tabulating a collection of points along the efficient frontier.

# Finding the Optimal Risky Portfolio on the Efficient Frontier

Now that we have traced out several points along the efficient frontier, our last task is to search for the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio. This is the portfolio on the efficient frontier that is tangent to the CAL. To find it, we determine the portfolio weights that maximize the Sharpe ratio. This requires two changes to the Solver. First, change the target cell from cell C26 to cell C27, the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio, and request that the value in this cell be maximized. Next, eliminate the constraint on the risk premium that may be left over from the last time you used the Solver. At this point the Solver looks like Panel C in Figure 7A.1.


The Solver now produces the optimal risky (the tangency) portfolio. Copy the statistics for the optimal portfolio and its weights to Panel C of your spreadsheet. In order to get a clean graph, place the columns for the minimum variance and tangency portfolios so that the risk premiums of all portfolios in the spreadsheet are steadily increasing, starting from the risk premium of column A  $(3.5\%)$  all the way up to  $8\%$ .

The resulting efficient frontier is graphed in Figure 7A.2. The data in cells B42 through L42 are used for the horizontal axis (portfolio standard deviation), while B41-L41 are used for the vertical or  $y$ -axis and contain the portfolio risk premium.

# The Optimal CAL

It is instructive to superimpose on the graph of the efficient frontier in Figure 7A.2 the CAL of the optimal risky portfolio. This CAL has a slope equal to that portfolio's Sharpe ratio. Therefore, at the bottom of Spreadsheet 7A.1, Panel C, we add a row with entries equal to the standard deviation of each column's portfolio multiplied by the Sharpe ratio of the optimal risky portfolio cell (H43). This results in the risk premium for each portfolio along the CAL. We now add a series to the graph with the standard deviations in B42-L42 as the  $x$ -axis and cells B51-L51 as the  $y$ -axis. You can see this CAL in Figure 7A.2.

# The Optimal Risky Portfolio and the Short-Sales Constraint

Using our input list, the optimal risky portfolio calls for short (negative) positions in the stocks of France and Canada (see column H of Spreadsheet 7A.1, Panel C). In many cases, however, the portfolio manager is prohibited from taking short positions. If so, we need to amend the program to preclude short sales.

To accomplish this task, we repeat the exercise, but with one change. We add to the Solver the following constraint: Each element in the column of portfolio weights, A17-A23, must be greater than or equal to zero. You should try to produce the short-sale-constrained efficient frontier in your own spreadsheet.

# APPENDIX B: Review of Portfolio Statistics

We base this review of scenario analysis on a two-asset portfolio. We denote the assets  $D$  and  $E$  (which you may think of as debt and equity), but the risk and return parameters we use in this appendix are not necessarily consistent with those used in Section 7.2.

# Expected Returns

We use "expected value" and "mean" interchangeably. For an analysis with  $n$  scenarios, where the rate of return in scenario  $i$  is  $r(i)$  with probability  $p(i)$ , the expected return is

$$
E (r) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) r (i) \tag {7B.1}
$$

If you increase the rate of return assumed for each scenario by some amount  $\Delta$ , then the mean return will increase by  $\Delta$ . If you multiply the rate in each scenario by a factor  $w$ , the new mean will be multiplied by that factor:

$$
\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) \times [ r (i) + \Delta ] = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) \times r (i) + \Delta \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) = E (r) + \Delta \tag {7B.2}
$$

$$
\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) \times [ w r (i) ] = w \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) \times r (i) = w E (r)
$$

# Example 7B.1 Expected Rates of Return

Column C of Spreadsheet 7B.1 shows scenario rates of return for debt,  $D$ . In column D we add  $3\%$  to each scenario return and in column E we multiply each rate by .4. The spreadsheet shows how we compute the expected return for columns C, D, and E. It is evident that the mean increases by  $3\%$  (from .08 to .11) in column D and is multiplied by .4 (from .08 to 0.032) in column E.

Now let's construct a portfolio that invests a fraction of the investment budget,  $w(D)$ , in bonds and the fraction  $w(E)$  in stocks. The portfolio's rate of return in each scenario and its expected return are given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {P} (i) = w _ {D} r _ {D} (i) + w _ {E} r _ {E} (i) \\ E \left(r _ {P}\right) = \sum p (i) \left[ w _ {D} r _ {D} (i) + w _ {E} r _ {E} (i) \right] = \sum p (i) w _ {D} r _ {D} (i) + \sum p (i) w _ {E} r _ {E} (i) \tag {7B.3} \\ = w _ {D} E \left(r _ {D}\right) + w _ {E} E \left(r _ {E}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

The rate of return on the portfolio in each scenario is the weighted average of the component rates. The weights are the fractions invested in these assets, that is, the portfolio weights. The expected return on the portfolio is the weighted average of the asset means.

# Example 7B.2 Portfolio Rate of Return

Spreadsheet 7B.2 lays out rates of return for both stocks and bonds. Using assumed weights of .4 for debt and .6 for equity, the portfolio return in each scenario appears in column L. Cell L8 shows the portfolio expected return as .1040, obtained using the SUMPRODUCT function, which multiplies each scenario return (column L) by the scenario probability (column I) and sums the results.

# Variance and Standard Deviation

The variance and standard deviation of the rate of return on an asset from a scenario analysis are given by

$$
\sigma^ {2} (r) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) [ r (i) - E (r) ] ^ {2} \tag {7B.4}
$$

$$
\sigma (r) = \sqrt {\sigma^ {2} (r)}

Scenario analysis for bonds and stocks

Variance (here, of an asset rate of return) is not the only possible choice to quantify variability. An alternative would be to use the absolute deviation from the mean instead of the squared deviation. Thus, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) is sometimes used as a measure of variability. The variance is the preferred measure for several reasons. First, working with absolute deviations is mathematically more difficult. Second, squaring deviations gives more weight to larger deviations. In investments, giving more weight to large deviations (hence, losses) is compatible with risk aversion. Third, when returns are normally distributed, the variance is one of the two parameters that fully characterizes the probability distribution.

Notice that the unit of variance is percent squared. In contrast, standard deviation, the square root of variance, has the same dimension as the original returns, and therefore is easier to interpret as a measure of return variability.

When you add a fixed incremental return,  $\Delta$ , to each scenario return, you increase the mean return by that same increment. Therefore, the deviation of the realized return in each scenario from the mean return is unaffected, and both variance and SD are unchanged. In contrast, when you multiply the return in each scenario by a factor  $w$ , the variance is multiplied by the square of that factor (and the SD is multiplied by  $w$ ):

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {V a r} (w r) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) \times [ w r (i) - E (w r) ] ^ {2} = w ^ {2} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) [ r (i) - E (r) ] ^ {2} = w ^ {2} \sigma^ {2} \tag {7B.5} \\ \mathrm {S D} (w r) = \sqrt {w ^ {2} \sigma^ {2}} = w \sigma (r) \\ \end{array}
$$

Excel does not have a direct function to compute variance and standard deviation for a scenario analysis. Its STDEV and VAR functions are designed for time series. We need to calculate the probability-weighted squared deviations directly. To avoid having to first compute columns of squared deviations from the mean, however, we can simplify our problem by expressing the variance as a difference between two easily computable terms:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma^ {2} (r) = E \left[ r - E (r) \right] ^ {2} = E \left\{r ^ {2} + \left[ E (r) \right] ^ {2} - 2 r E (r) \right\} \\ = E \left(r ^ {2}\right) + \left[ E (r) \right] ^ {2} - 2 E (r) E (r) \tag {7B.6} \\ = E \left(r ^ {2}\right) - \left[ E (r) \right] ^ {2} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) r (i) ^ {2} - \left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) r (i) \right] ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

# Example 7B.3 Calculating the Variance of a Risky Asset in Excel

You can compute the first expression,  $E(r^2)$ , in Equation 7B.6 using Excel's SUMPRODUCT function. For example, in Spreadsheet 7B.3,  $E(r^2)$  is first calculated in cell C21 by using SUMPRODUCT to multiply the scenario probability times the asset return times the asset return again. Then  $[E(r)]^2$  is subtracted (notice the subtraction of  $C20^2$  in cell C21), to arrive at variance.

Scenario analysis for bonds

The variance of a portfolio return is not as simple to compute as the mean. The portfolio variance is not the weighted average of the asset variances. The deviation of the portfolio rate of return in any scenario from its mean return is

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {P} - E (r _ {P}) = w _ {D} r _ {D} (i) + w _ {E} r _ {E} (i) - \left[ w _ {D} E (r _ {D}) + w _ {E} E (r _ {E}) \right] \\ = w _ {D} \left[ r _ {D} (i) - E \left(r _ {D}\right) \right] + w _ {E} \left[ r _ {E} (i) - E \left(r _ {E}\right) \right] \tag {7B.7} \\ = w _ {D} d (i) + w _ {E} e (i) \\ \end{array}
$$ where the lowercase variables denote deviations from the mean:


$$ d (i) = r _ {D} (i) - E (r _ {D})
$$

$$ e (i) = r _ {E} (i) - E (r _ {E})
$$

We express the variance of the portfolio return in terms of these deviations from the mean in Equation 7B.8:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) [ r _ {P} - E (r _ {P}) ] ^ {2} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) [ w _ {D} d (i) + w _ {E} e (i) ] ^ {2} \\ = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) \left[ w _ {D} ^ {2} d (i) ^ {2} + w _ {E} ^ {2} e (i) ^ {2} + 2 w _ {D} w _ {E} d (i) e (i) \right] \tag {7B.8} \\ = w _ {D} ^ {2} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) d (i) ^ {2} + w _ {E} ^ {2} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) e (i) ^ {2} + 2 w _ {D} w _ {E} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) d (i) e (i) \\ = w _ {D} ^ {2} \sigma_ {D} ^ {2} + w _ {E} ^ {2} \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} + 2 w _ {D} w _ {E} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} p (i) d (i) e (i) \\ \end{array}
$$

The last line in Equation 7B.8 tells us that the variance of a portfolio is the weighted sum of portfolio variances (notice that the weights are the squares of the portfolio weights), plus an additional term that, as we will soon see, makes all the difference.

Notice also that  $d(i) \times e(i)$  is the product of the deviations of the scenario returns of the two assets from their respective means. The probability-weighted average of this product is its expected value, which is called covariance and is denoted  $\mathrm{Cov}(r_D, r_E)$ . The covariance between the two assets can have a big impact on the variance of a portfolio.

# Covariance

The covariance between two variables equals

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D}, r _ {E}\right) = E (d \times e) = E \left\{\left[ r _ {D} - E \left(r _ {D}\right) \right] \left[ r _ {E} - E \left(r _ {E}\right) \right] \right\} \\ = E \left(r _ {D} r _ {E}\right) - E \left(r _ {D}\right) E \left(r _ {E}\right) \tag {7B.9} \\ \end{array}
$$

The covariance is an elegant way to quantify the covariation of two variables. This is easiest seen through a numerical example.

Imagine a three-scenario analysis of stocks and bonds such as that given in Spreadsheet 7B.4. In scenario 1, bonds go down (negative deviation) while stocks go up (positive deviation). In scenario 3, bonds are up, but stocks are down. When the rates move in opposite directions, as in this case, the product of the deviations is negative; conversely, if the rates moved in the same direction, the sign of the product would be positive. The magnitude of the product shows the extent of the opposite or common movement in that scenario.

# Spreadsheet 7B.4

Three-scenario analysis for stocks and bonds

The probability-weighted average of these products therefore summarizes the average tendency for the variables to co-vary across scenarios. In the last line of the spreadsheet, we see that the covariance is  $-80$  (cell H6).

Suppose our scenario analysis had envisioned stocks generally moving in the same direction as bonds. To be concrete, let's switch the forecast rates on stocks in the first and third scenarios, that is, let the stock return be  $-10\%$  in the first scenario and  $30\%$  in the third. In this case, the absolute values of both products of deviations from the mean in these scenarios remains the same, but the signs are now positive, and thus the covariance is positive, at  $+80$ , reflecting the tendency for both asset returns to vary in tandem. If the levels of the scenario returns change, the intensity of the covariation also may change, as reflected by the magnitude of the product of deviations. The covariance quantifies both the direction and intensity of the covariation.

If the average co-movement is zero because positive and negative products are equally likely, the covariance is zero. Also, if one of the assets is risk-free, its covariance with any risky asset is zero because its deviations from its mean are zero in each scenario.

The computation of covariance using Excel can be made easy by using the last line in Equation 7B.9. The first term,  $E(r_{D} \times r_{E})$ , can be computed in one stroke using Excel's SUMPRODUCT function. Specifically, in Spreadsheet 7B.4, SUMPRODUCT(A3:A5, B3:B5, C3:C5) multiplies the probability times the return on debt times the return on equity in each scenario and then sums those three products.

Notice that adding  $\Delta$  to each rate would not change the covariance because deviations from the mean would remain unchanged. But if you multiply either of the variables by a fixed factor, the covariance will increase by that factor. Multiplying both variables results in a covariance multiplied by the products of the factors because

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {C o v} \left(w _ {D} r _ {D}, w _ {E} r _ {E}\right) = E \left\{\left[ w _ {D} r _ {D} - w _ {D} E \left(r _ {D}\right) \right] \left[ w _ {E} r _ {E} - w _ {E} E \left(r _ {E}\right) \right] \right\} \\ = w _ {D} w _ {E} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D}, r _ {E}\right) \tag {7B.10} \\ \end{array}
$$

The covariance in Equation 7B.10 is actually the term that we add (twice) in the last line of the equation for portfolio variance, Equation 7B.8. So we find that portfolio variance is the weighted sum (not average) of the individual asset variances, plus twice their covariance weighted by the two portfolio weights  $(w_{D} \times w_{E})$ .

Like variance, the dimension (unit) of covariance is percent squared. But here we cannot get to a more easily interpreted dimension by taking the square root because the average product of deviations can be negative, as it was in Spreadsheet 7B.4. The solution in this case is to scale the covariance by the standard deviations of the two variables, producing the correlation coefficient.


# Correlation Coefficient

Dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the variables will generate a pure number called correlation. We define correlation as follows:

$$
\operatorname {C o r r} \left(r _ {D}, r _ {E}\right) = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D} , r _ {E}\right)}{\sigma_ {D} \sigma_ {E}} \tag {7B.11}
$$

The correlation coefficient must fall within the range  $[-1, 1]$ . This can be explained as follows. What two variables should have the highest degree co-movement? Logic says a variable with itself, so let's check it out.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D}, r _ {D}\right) = E \left\{\left[ r _ {D} - E \left(r _ {D}\right) \right] \times \left[ r _ {D} - E \left(r _ {D}\right) \right] \right\} \\ = E \left[ r _ {D} - E \left(r _ {D}\right) \right] ^ {2} = \sigma_ {D} ^ {2} \tag {7B.12} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\operatorname {C o r r} (r _ {D}, r _ {D}) = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} (r _ {D} , r _ {D})}{\sigma_ {D} \sigma_ {D}} = \frac {\sigma_ {D} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {D} ^ {2}} = 1
$$

Similarly, the lowest (most negative) value of the correlation coefficient is  $-1$ . (Check this for yourself by finding the correlation of a variable with its own negative.)

An important property of the correlation coefficient is that it is unaffected by both addition and multiplication. Suppose we start with a return on debt,  $r_{D}$ ; multiply it by a constant,  $w_{D}$ ; and then add a fixed amount  $\Delta$ . The correlation with equity is unaffected:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {C o r r} \left(\Delta + w _ {D} r _ {D}, r _ {E}\right) = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(\Delta + w _ {D} r _ {D} , r _ {E}\right)}{\sqrt {\operatorname {V a r} \left(\Delta + w _ {D} r _ {D}\right)} \times \sigma_ {E}} \\ = \frac {w _ {D} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D} , r _ {E}\right)}{\sqrt {w _ {D} ^ {2} \sigma_ {D} ^ {2}} \times \sigma_ {E}} = \frac {w _ {D} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D} , r _ {E}\right)}{w _ {D} \sigma_ {D} \times \sigma_ {E}} \tag {7B.13} \\ = \operatorname {C o r r} (r _ {D}, r _ {E}) \\ \end{array}
$$

Because the correlation coefficient gives more intuition about the relationship between rates of return, we sometimes express the covariance in terms of the correlation coefficient. Rearranging Equation 7B.11, we can write covariance as

$$
\operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D}, r _ {E}\right) = \sigma_ {D} \sigma_ {E} \operatorname {C o r r} \left(r _ {D}, r _ {E}\right) \tag {7B.14}
$$

# Example 7B.4 Calculating Covariance and Correlation

Spreadsheet 7B.5 shows the covariance and correlation between stocks and bonds using the same scenario analysis as in the other examples in this appendix. Covariance is calculated using Equation 7B.9. The SUMPRODUCT function used in cell J22 gives us  $E(r_{D} \times r_{E})$ , from which we subtract  $E(r_{D}) \times E(r_{E})$  (i.e., we subtract  $J20 \times K20$ ). Then we calculate correlation in cell J23 by dividing covariance by the product of the asset standard deviations.

# Portfolio Variance

We have seen in Equation 7B.8, with the help of Equation 7B.10, that the variance of a two-asset portfolio is the sum of the individual variances multiplied by the square of the portfolio weights, plus twice the covariance between the rates, multiplied by the product of the portfolio weights:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = w _ {D} ^ {2} \sigma_ {D} ^ {2} + w _ {E} ^ {2} \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} + 2 w _ {D} w _ {E} \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {D}, r _ {E}\right) \\ = w _ {D} ^ {2} \sigma_ {D} ^ {2} + w _ {E} ^ {2} \sigma_ {E} ^ {2} + 2 w _ {D} w _ {E} \sigma_ {D} \sigma_ {E} \operatorname {C o r r} \left(r _ {D}, r _ {E}\right) \tag {7B.15} \\ \end{array}
$$

# Example 7B.5 Calculating Portfolio Variance

We calculate portfolio variance in Spreadsheet 7B.6. Notice there that we calculate the portfolio standard deviation in two ways: once from the scenario portfolio returns (cell E35) and again (in cell E36) using the first line of Equation 7B.15. The two approaches yield the same result. You should try to repeat the second calculation using the correlation coefficient from the second line in Equation 7B.15 instead of covariance in the formula for portfolio variance.

# Spreadsheet 7B.6

Scenario analysis for bonds and stocks

Suppose that one of the assets, say,  $E$ , is replaced with a money market instrument, that is, a risk-free asset. The variance of  $E$  is then zero, as is the covariance with  $D$ . In that case, as seen from Equation 7B.15, the portfolio standard deviation is just  $w_{D}\sigma_{D}$ . In other words, when we mix a risky portfolio with the risk-free asset, portfolio standard deviation equals the risky asset's standard deviation times the weight invested in that asset. This result was used extensively in Chapter 6.

# Index Models

# 8

THE MARKOWITZ PROCEDURE introduced in the preceding chapter suffers from two drawbacks. First, the model requires a huge number of estimates to fill the covariance matrix. Second, it does not provide any guidelines for finding useful estimates of these covariances or the risk premiums that are essential to construct the efficient frontier of risky assets. Because past returns are noisy guides to expected future returns, this drawback can be telling.

In this chapter, we introduce index models that simplify estimation of the covariance matrix and greatly enhance the analysis of security risk premiums. By allowing us to explicitly decompose risk into systematic and firm-specific components, these models also shed considerable light on both the power and the limits of diversification. Further, they allow us to measure these components of risk for particular securities and portfolios.

We begin the chapter by describing a single-factor security market and show how it can justify a single-index model of security returns. Once its properties are analyzed, we proceed to show how the single-index model can be estimated from widely available data. We review the statistical properties of these estimates and show how they relate to the practical issues facing portfolio managers.


Despite the simplification they offer, index models remain true to the concepts of the efficient frontier and portfolio optimization. Moreover, they can be used to identify optimal portfolios nearly as accurately as the much more data-intensive Markowitz algorithm.

Finally, we examine optimal risky portfolios constructed using the index model. While the principles are the same as those employed in the previous chapter, the properties of the portfolio are easier to derive and interpret in this context. We illustrate how to use the index model by constructing an optimal risky portfolio using a small sample of firms. This portfolio is compared to the corresponding portfolio constructed from the Markowitz model.

# 8.1 A Single-Factor Security Market

# The Input List of the Markowitz Model

The success of a portfolio selection rule depends on the quality of the input list, that is, the estimates of expected security returns and the covariance matrix. In the long run, efficient portfolios will beat portfolios with less reliable input lists and consequently inferior reward-to-risk trade-offs.

Suppose your security analysts can thoroughly analyze 50 stocks. This means that your input list will include the following:

$$
\begin{array}{l} n = \quad 5 0 \text {e s t i m a t e s o f e x p e c t e d r e t u r n s} \\ n = \quad 5 0 \text {e s t i m a t e s o f v a r i a n c e s} \\ (n ^ {2} - n) / 2 = \frac {1 , 2 2 5}{1 , 3 2 5} \text {e s t i m a t e s o f c o v a r i a n c e s} \\ \end{array}
$$

This is a formidable task, particularly in light of the fact that a 50-security portfolio is relatively small. Doubling  $n$  to 100 will nearly quadruple the number of estimates to 5,150. If  $n = 3,000$ , still less than the number of issues included in the Wilshire 5000 index, we need more than 4.5 million estimates.

Another difficulty in applying the Markowitz model to portfolio optimization is that errors in the assessment or estimation of correlation coefficients can lead to nonsensical results. This can happen because some sets of correlation coefficients are mutually inconsistent, as the following example demonstrates:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Asset</td><td rowspan="2">Standard Deviation (\%)</td><td colspan="3">Correlation Matrix</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>20</td><td>1.00</td><td>0.90</td><td>0.90</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>20</td><td>0.90</td><td>1.00</td><td>0.00</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>20</td><td>0.90</td><td>0.00</td><td>1.00</td></tr></table>

Suppose that you construct a portfolio with weights  $-1.00, 1.00, 1.00$  for assets A, B, C, respectively, and calculate the portfolio variance. If you use the standard formulas for portfolio variance, you will find that it appears to be negative  $(-200)$ ! This, of course, is not possible: Variances cannot be negative. We conclude that the inputs in the estimated correlation matrix must be mutually inconsistent. Of course, true correlation coefficients are always consistent. But we do not know these true correlations and can only estimate them with some imprecision. Unfortunately, as this example illustrates, it is difficult to determine at a quick glance whether a correlation matrix is inconsistent, providing another motivation to seek a model that is easier to implement.

Introducing a model that simplifies the way we describe the sources of security risk allows us to use a smaller, necessarily consistent, and, just as important, more easily interpreted set of estimates of risk parameters and risk premiums. The simplification emerges because positive covariances among security returns arise from common economic forces that affect the fortunes of most firms. Some examples of common economic factors are business cycles, interest rates, and the cost of natural resources. "Shocks" (i.e., unexpected changes) to these macroeconomic variables cause, simultaneously, correlated shocks in the rates of return on stocks across the entire market. By decomposing uncertainty into these systemwide versus firm-specific sources, we vastly simplify the problem of estimating covariance and correlation.


# Systematic versus Firm-Specific Risk

We focus on risk by separating the actual rate of return on any security,  $i$ , into the sum of its previously expected value plus an unanticipated surprise:

$$ r _ {i} = E \left(r _ {i}\right) + \text {u n a n t i c i p a t e d} \tag {8.1}
$$

The unanticipated component of the stock return can be due either to unexpected developments in issues that are particular to the firm or to unexpected changes in conditions that affect the broad economy. We therefore will decompose the sources of return uncertainty into uncertainty about the economy as a whole, which is captured by a systematic market factor that we will call  $m$ , and uncertainty about the firm in particular, which is captured by a firm-specific random variable that we will call  $e_i$ . The common dependence that virtually all firms have to macroeconomic conditions is the source of the correlation between their security returns.

The market factor,  $m$ , measures unanticipated developments in the macroeconomy. For example, it might be the difference between GDP growth and the market's previous expectation of that growth. As such, it has a mean of zero (over time, surprises will average out to zero), with standard deviation of  $\sigma_{m}$ . In contrast,  $e_{i}$  measures only the firm-specific surprise. As a surprise, it too has zero expected value. Notice that  $m$  has no subscript because the same common factor affects all securities. Most important is the fact that  $m$  and  $e_{i}$  are assumed to be uncorrelated: Because  $e_{i}$  is firm-specific, it is independent of shocks to the common factor that affect the entire economy. The variance of  $r_{i}$  thus arises from two uncorrelated sources, systematic and firm-specific.

Finally, we recognize that some securities will be more sensitive than others to macroeconomic shocks. For example, auto firms might respond more dramatically to changes in general economic conditions than pharmaceutical firms. We can capture this refinement by assigning each firm a sensitivity coefficient to macro conditions. Therefore, if we denote the sensitivity coefficient for firm  $i$  by the Greek letter beta,  $\beta_{i}$ , we can write the return on each stock in any period as the sum of three terms: the originally expected return, the impact of the common macroeconomic surprise (which depends on the firm's sensitivity to that surprise), and the impact of firm-specific surprises. Equation 8.2 is the algebraic expression of this single-factor model:

$$ r _ {i} = E \left(r _ {i}\right) + \beta_ {i} m + e _ {i} \tag {8.2}
$$

There are two uncorrelated random terms on the right-hand side of Equation 8.2, so the total variance of  $r_i$  is

$$
\sigma_ {i} ^ {2} = \beta_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} + \sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {i}\right) \tag {8.3}
$$

The variance of returns attributable to the marketwide factor is called the systematic risk of the security. This component of variance equals  $\beta_i^2\sigma_m^2$  and is higher when firm  $i$ 's beta coefficient is higher. "Cyclical" firms have greater sensitivity to the market (higher betas) and therefore have greater systematic risk. The firm-specific component of return variance is  $\sigma^2 (e_i)$ .


Because the index model assumes that firm-specific surprises are mutually uncorrelated, the only source of covariance between any pair of securities is their common dependence on the market return. Therefore, the covariance between two firms' returns depends on the sensitivity of each to the market, as measured by their betas:

$$
\operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {i}, r _ {j}\right) = \operatorname {C o v} \left(\beta_ {i} m + e _ {i}, \beta_ {j} m + e _ {j}\right) = \beta_ {i} \beta_ {j} \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} \tag {8.4}
$$

The decomposition of return variability into components that depend on a common macroeconomic factor versus firm-specific shocks is compelling but, to be useful, we still need a variable that can proxy for this common factor. This variable must be observable, so we can estimate its volatility as well as the sensitivity of individual securities to variation in its outcome.

# 8.2 The Single-Index Model

Because the systematic factor affects the performance of all stocks, the rate of return on a broad market index can plausibly proxy for that common factor. This approach leads to an equation similar to the single-factor model, which is called a single-index model because it uses the market index to stand in for the common factor.

# The Regression Equation of the Single-Index Model

The intuition behind the index model can be seen in Figure 8.1. We begin with a historical sample of paired observations of excess returns on the market index and a particular security, let's say shares in U.S. Steel. In Figure 8.1, we have 60 pairs of monthly excess returns, one for each month in a 5-year sample. Each dot represents the pair of returns in one particular month. For example, in June 2019, U.S. Steel's excess return was  $29.75\%$  while the market's was  $6.93\%$ .

To describe the typical relation between the return on U.S. Steel and the return on the market index, we fit a straight line through this scatter diagram. It is clear from this "line of best fit" that there is a positive relation between U.S. Steel's return and the market's. This is evidence for the importance of broad market conditions on the performance of U.S. Steel's stock. The slope of the line reflects the sensitivity of U.S. Steel's return to market conditions: A steeper line would imply that the rate of return is more responsive to the market return. On the other hand, the scatter diagram also shows that market conditions are not the entire story: If returns perfectly tracked those of the market, then all return pairs would lie exactly on the line. The scatter of points around the line is evidence that firm-specific events also have a significant impact on the company's return.

How do we determine the line of best fit in Figure 8.1? We will denote the market index by  $M$ , with excess return of  $R_{M} = r_{M} - r_{f}$ , and standard deviation of  $\sigma_{M}$ . We estimate the line using a single-variable linear regression. Specifically, denoting U.S. Steel by its ticker symbol  $X$ , we regress its excess return,  $R_{X} = r_{X} - r_{f}$ , on the excess return of the index,  $R_{M}$ .

Figure 8.1 Scatter diagram for U.S. Steel against the market index and U.S. Steel's security characteristic line, 5 years ending December 2021.

More generally, for any stock  $i$ , denote the pair of excess returns in month  $t$  by  $R_{i}(t)$  and  $R_{M}(t)$ . Then the index model can be written as the following regression equation:

$$
R _ {i} (t) = \alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {M} (t) + e _ {i} (t) \tag {8.5}
$$

The intercept of this equation (denoted by the Greek letter alpha, or  $\alpha$ ) is the security's expected excess return when the market excess return is zero. It is the vertical intercept in Figure 8.1. The slope of the line in the figure is the security's beta coefficient,  $\beta_{i}$ . Beta is the amount by which the security return tends to increase or decrease for every  $1\%$  increase or decrease in the return on the index, and therefore measures the security's sensitivity to the market index.  $e_{i}(t)$  is the zero-mean, firm-specific surprise in the security return in month  $t$ , also called the residual. The greater the residuals (positive or negative), the wider is the scatter of returns around the straight line in Figure 8.1.

Notice that so far, there is little "theory" in the index model. It is merely a way to describe the typical relation between market returns and returns on particular firms. The average beta of all stocks in the economy is 1; the average response of a stock to changes in a market index composed of all stocks must be 1-for-1. The beta of the market index is, by definition, 1: The index obviously responds 1-for-1 to changes in itself. "Cyclical" or aggressive stocks have higher-than-average sensitivity to the broad economy and therefore have betas greater than 1. Conversely, the betas of "defensive" stocks are less than 1. The returns of these stocks respond less than 1-for-1 to market returns.

While the index model is mostly descriptive, it nevertheless will help us address these two important questions: (1) What relation might we expect to observe between a stock's beta and its expected return? and (2) What value for alpha should we expect to observe when markets are in equilibrium? We will have much to say on these topics below.

# The Expected Return-Beta Relationship

Because  $E(e_{i}) = 0$ , if we take the expected value of both sides of Equation 8.5, we obtain the expected return-beta relationship of the single-index model:

$$
E \left(R _ {i}\right) = \alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {i} E \left(R _ {M}\right) \tag {8.6}
$$

The second term in Equation 8.6 tells us that part of a security's risk premium is due to the risk premium of the index. The market risk premium is multiplied by the relative sensitivity, or beta, of the individual security. This makes intuitive sense because securities with high betas have a magnified sensitivity to market risk and will therefore provide a greater risk premium as compensation for this risk. We call this the systematic risk premium because it derives from the risk premium that characterizes the market index, which in turn proxies for the condition of the full economy or economic system.

The remainder of the risk premium is given by the first term in the equation,  $\alpha$ . Alpha is a nonmarket premium. For example,  $\alpha$  may be large if you think a security is underpriced and therefore offers an attractive expected return. Later on, we will see that when security prices are in equilibrium, such attractive opportunities ought to be competed away, in which case  $\alpha$  will be driven to zero. But for now, let's assume that security analysts come up with their own estimates of alpha. If managers believe that they can do a superior job of security analysis, then they will be confident in their ability to find stocks with nonzero values of alpha.

We will see shortly that the index model decomposition of an individual security's risk premium to market and nonmarket components greatly clarifies and simplifies the operation of macroeconomic and security analysis within an investment company.

# Risk and Covariance in the Single-Index Model

Remember that one of the problems with the Markowitz model is the large number of parameter estimates required to implement it. Now we will see that the index model vastly reduces the number of parameters that must be estimated. In particular, we saw from Equation 8.4 that the covariance between any pair of stocks is determined by their common exposure to market risk; this insight yields great simplification in estimating an otherwise overwhelming number of covariance pairs. Using Equation 8.5, we can derive the following elements of the input list for portfolio optimization from the parameters of the index model:

Total risk  $=$  Systematic risk + Firm-specific risk

$$
\sigma_ {i} ^ {2} = \beta_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} + \sigma^ {2} (e _ {i}); \text {c o m p a r e t o E q u a t i o n 8 . 3}
$$

Covariance = Product of betas × Market-index risk

$$
\operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {i}, r _ {j}\right) = \beta_ {i} \beta_ {j} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2}; \text {c o m p a r e t o E q u a t i o n 8 . 4} \tag {8.7}
$$

Correlation = Product of correlations with the market index

$$
\operatorname {C o r r} \left(r _ {i}, r _ {j}\right) = \frac {\beta_ {i} \beta_ {j} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {i} \sigma_ {j}} = \frac {\beta_ {i} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {i} \sigma_ {M}} \times \frac {\beta_ {j} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {j} \sigma_ {M}} = \operatorname {C o r r} \left(r _ {i}, r _ {M}\right) \times \operatorname {C o r r} \left(r _ {j}, r _ {M}\right)
$$

Equations 8.6 and 8.7 imply that the set of parameter estimates needed for the single-index model consists of only  $\alpha_{i}$ ,  $\beta_{i}$ , and  $\sigma(e_{i})$  for each individual security, plus the risk premium and variance of the market index.

# Concept Check 8.1

The data below describe a three-stock financial market that satisfies the single-index model.

<table><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Capitalization</td><td>Beta</td><td>Mean Excess Return</td><td>Standard Deviation</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>3,000</td><td>1.0</td><td>10\%</td><td>40\%</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>1,940</td><td>0.2</td><td>2</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>1,360</td><td>1.7</td><td>17</td><td>50</td></tr></table>

The standard deviation of the market-index portfolio is  $25\%$ .

a. What is the mean excess return of the index portfolio?
b. What is the covariance between stock A and stock B?
c. What is the covariance between stock  $B$  and the index?
d. Break down the variance of stock  $B$  into its systematic and firm-specific components.

# The Set of Estimates Needed for the Single-Index Model

We summarize the results for the single-index model in the table below.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Symbol</td></tr><tr><td>1. The stock&#x27;s expected return if the market is neutral, that is, if the market&#x27;s excess return,  r_M - r_f , is zero</td><td> \alpha_i </td></tr><tr><td>2. The component of return due to movements in the overall market in any period;  \beta_i  is the security&#x27;s responsiveness to market movements</td><td> \beta_i(r_M - r_f) </td></tr><tr><td>3. The unexpected component of return in any period due to unexpected events that are relevant only to this security (firm specific)</td><td> e_i </td></tr><tr><td>4. The variance attributable to the uncertainty of the common macro-economic factor</td><td> \beta_i^2\sigma_M^2 </td></tr><tr><td>5. The variance attributable to firm-specific uncertainty</td><td> \sigma^2(e_i) </td></tr></table>

These calculations show that if we have:

-  $n$  estimates of the extra-market expected excess returns,  ${\alpha }_{i}$
-  $n$  estimates of the sensitivity coefficients,  $\beta_{i}$
-  $n$  estimates of the firm-specific variances,  ${\sigma }^{2}\left( {e}_{i}\right)$
1 estimate for the market risk premium,  $E(R_{M})$
1 estimate for the variance of the (common) macroeconomic factor,  $\sigma_M^2$ then these  $(3n + 2)$  estimates will enable us to prepare the entire input list for this single-index-security universe. Thus, for a 10-security portfolio, we cut the number of estimates roughly in half, from 65 to 32. But for a diversified portfolio of 500 stocks, we reduce the number of parameter estimates from 125,750 to 1,502, a decline of nearly  $99\%$


It is easy to see why the index model is such a useful abstraction. For large universes of securities, the number of estimates required for the Markowitz procedure using the index model is only a small fraction of what otherwise would be needed.

Another advantage is less obvious but equally important. The index model abstraction is crucial for specialization of effort in security analysis. If a covariance term had to be calculated directly for each security pair, then security analysts could not specialize by industry. For example, if one group were to specialize in the computer industry and another in the auto industry, who would have the common background to estimate the covariance between Dell and GM? Neither group would have the deep understanding of other industries necessary to make an informed judgment of co-movements among industries. In contrast, the index model suggests a simple way to compute covariances. They are due to the common influence of the single macroeconomic factor, represented by the market index return, and can be easily estimated using Equation 8.7.

The simplification derived from the index model assumption is, however, not without cost. The "cost" of the model lies in the restrictions it places on the structure of asset return uncertainty. The classification of uncertainty into a simple dichotomy—macro versus micro risk—oversimplifies sources of real-world uncertainty and misses some important sources of dependence in stock returns. For example, this dichotomy rules out industry events that may affect many firms within an industry without substantially affecting the broad macroeconomy.

This last point is potentially important. Imagine that the single-index model is perfectly accurate, except that the residuals of two stocks, say, British Petroleum (BP) and Shell Oil, are correlated. The index model will ignore this correlation (it will assume it is zero), while the Markowitz algorithm (which accounts for the full covariance between every pair of stocks) will automatically take the residual correlation into account when minimizing portfolio variance. If the universe of securities from which we construct the optimal portfolio is small, the two models can yield substantively different optimal portfolios. The portfolio resulting from the Markowitz algorithm will place a smaller weight on both BP and Shell because their mutual covariance reduces their diversification value. Conversely, when correlation among residuals is negative, the index model will ignore the potential diversification value of these securities. The resulting "optimal" portfolio will place too little weight on these securities.

The optimal portfolio derived from the single-index model therefore can be significantly inferior to that of the full-covariance (Markowitz) model when stocks with correlated residuals account for a large fraction of the portfolio. If many pairs of the covered stocks exhibit residual correlation, it is possible that a multi-index model, which includes additional factors to capture those extra sources of cross-security correlation, would be better suited for portfolio analysis and construction. We will demonstrate the effect of correlated residuals in the spreadsheet example in this chapter, leaving our discussion of multi-index models to later chapters.

# Concept Check 8.2

Suppose that the index model for the excess returns of stocks  $A$  and  $B$  is estimated with the following results:

$$
R _ {A} = 1.0 \% + .9 R _ {M} + e _ {A}
$$

$$
R _ {B} = - 2.0 \% + 1.1 R _ {M} + e _ {B}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {M} = 20 \%
$$

$$
\sigma \left(\mathrm {e} _ {A}\right) = 30 \%
$$

$$
\sigma \left(e _ {B}\right) = 10 \%
$$

Find the standard deviation of each stock and the covariance between them.

# The Index Model and Diversification

The index model, first suggested by Sharpe, $^{4}$  also offers insight into portfolio diversification. Suppose that we choose an equally weighted portfolio of  $n$  securities. The excess rate of return on each security is given by

$$
R _ {i} = \alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {M} + e _ {i}
$$

Similarly, we can write the excess return on the portfolio of stocks as

$$
R _ {P} = \alpha_ {P} + \beta_ {P} R _ {M} + e _ {P} \tag {8.8}
$$

We now show that, as the number of stocks included in this portfolio increases, the part of the portfolio risk attributable to nonmarket factors becomes ever smaller. This part of the risk is diversified away, and therefore will be of little concern to investors. In contrast, market risk remains, regardless of the number of firms combined into the portfolio.

To understand these results, note that the excess rate of return on an equally weighted portfolio, for which each portfolio weight  $w_{i} = 1 / n$ , is

$$
\begin{array}{l} R _ {P} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} w _ {i} R _ {i} = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} R _ {i} = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \left(\alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {M} + e _ {i}\right) \tag {8.9} \\ = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i} + \left(\frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \beta_ {i}\right) R _ {M} + \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \\ \end{array}
$$

Comparing Equations 8.8 and 8.9, we see that the portfolio has a sensitivity to the market given by

$$
\beta_ {P} = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \beta_ {i} \tag {8.10}
$$ which is the average of the individual  $\beta_{i}\mathrm{s}$ . It has a nonmarket return component of


$$
\alpha_ {P} = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i} \tag {8.11}
$$ which is the average of the individual alphas, plus the zero mean variable


$$ e _ {P} = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i} \tag {8.12}
$$ which is the average of the firm-specific components. Hence, the portfolio's variance is


$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \beta_ {P} ^ {2} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} + \sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {P}\right) \tag {8.13}
$$

The systematic component of the portfolio variance, which we defined as the component that depends on marketwide movements, is  $\beta_P^2\sigma_M^2$  and depends on the average beta coefficient of the individual securities. This part of the risk depends on portfolio beta and  $\sigma_M^2$  and will persist regardless of the extent of portfolio diversification. No matter how many stocks are held, their common exposure to the market will result in a positive portfolio beta and be reflected in portfolio systematic risk. $^5$

In contrast, the nonsystematic component of the portfolio variance is  $\sigma^2 (e_P)$  and is attributable to the firm-specific components,  $e_i$ . Because these  $e_i$ s are independent, and all have zero expected value, the law of averages can be applied to conclude that as more and more stocks are added to the portfolio, the firm-specific components tend to cancel out, resulting in ever-smaller nonmarket risk. Such risk is thus termed diversifiable. To see this more rigorously, examine the formula for the variance of the equally weighted "portfolio" of firm-specific components. Because the  $e_i$ s are uncorrelated,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/e4f0ec1c2ee1bf4b8c58ece40c15a055d2a906bf3987f96426ca73821ccdbb9f.jpg)
Figure 8.2 The variance of an equally weighted portfolio with risk coefficient  $\beta_{P}$  in the single-index economy as a function of the number of firms included in the portfolio


$$
\sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {P}\right) = \operatorname {V a r} \left(\frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} e _ {i}\right) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \left(\frac {1}{n}\right) ^ {2} \sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {i}\right) = \frac {1}{n} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \frac {\sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {i}\right)}{n} = \frac {1}{n} \bar {\sigma} ^ {2} (e) \tag {8.14}
$$ where  $\overline{\sigma}^2(e)$  is the average of the firm-specific variances. Because the average nonsystematic variance is independent of  $n$ , when  $n$  gets large,  $\sigma^2(e_p)$  becomes negligible.


To summarize, as diversification increases, the total variance of a portfolio approaches the systematic variance, defined as the variance of the market index multiplied by the square of the portfolio sensitivity coefficient,  $\beta_P^2$ . This is shown in Figure 8.2.

Figure 8.2 shows that as more and more securities are combined into a portfolio, the portfolio variance decreases because of the diversification of firm-specific risk. However, the power of diversification is limited. Even for very large  $n$ , part of the risk remains because of the exposure of virtually all assets to the common, or market, factor. Therefore, systematic risk is said to be nondiversifiable.

This analysis is borne out by empirical evidence. We saw the effect of portfolio diversification on portfolio standard deviations in Figure 7.2. These empirical results are similar to the theoretical graph presented here in Figure 8.2.

# Concept Check 8.3

Reconsider the two stocks in Concept Check 8.2. Suppose we form an equally weighted portfolio of  $A$  and  $B$ . What will be the nonsystematic standard deviation of that portfolio?

# 8.3 Estimating the Single-Index Model

Let's pause here to see how one would actually estimate the parameters of the index model. We work with monthly observations of rates of return for the market index and a particular stock. As in Chapter 5, we will use as the market index a comprehensive value-weighted portfolio of the firms that actively trade on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ. We will treat T-bills as the risk-free asset, and we will estimate the parameters of the model over the 5-year period ending in December 2021.

# The Security Characteristic Line for U.S. Steel

Figure 8.3 shows a graph of the excess returns on U.S. Steel and the market index over the 5-year period. Consistent with Figure 8.1, the graph shows that the firm's returns generally follow those of the index, but with noticeably larger swings. Indeed, the monthly standard deviation of the excess return on the index portfolio over the period was  $4.66\%$ , while that of U.S. Steel was  $17.77\%$ . The larger swings in U.S. Steel's excess returns suggest that we should find a greater-than-average sensitivity to the market index, that is, a beta greater than 1.0.

The index model regression was stated in Equation 8.5 and plotted in Figure 8.1, using U.S. Steel as our example firm. We restate it here as:

$$
R _ {\chi} (t) = \alpha_ {\chi} + \beta_ {\chi} R _ {\text {i n d e x}} (t) + e _ {\chi} (t)
$$

The equation describes the (linear) dependence of U.S. Steel's excess return on the excess return of the market index portfolio. The regression estimates describe a straight line with intercept  $\alpha_{X}$  and slope  $\beta_{X}$ , which we call U.S. Steel's security characteristic line (SCL).

The vertical distance of each point from the regression line in Figure 8.1 is the value of U.S. Steel's residual,  $e_X(t)$ , in that particular month. For example, in June 2019, when the market's excess return was  $6.93\%$ , the regression line would have predicted an excess return for U.S. Steel of  $13.91\%$ . This is the  $y$ -axis value on the regression line corresponding to an  $x$ -axis value (the market's excess return) of  $6.93\%$ . In fact, U.S. Steel's excess return in June was  $29.75\%$ , implying that the residual return in this month was  $29.75\% - 13.91\% =$

15.84\%. This is evidence of good firm-specific news that contributed 15.84\% to U.S. Steel's rate of return.

We estimate the parameters of the regression line in Figure 8.1 using Excel's Regression tool (this tool is available as an Add-In under the Data tab). A portion of the output is shown in Table 8.1.

# The Explanatory Power of U.S. Steel's SCL

Starting with the upper panel of Table 8.1, we see that the correlation of U.S. Steel with the market index is fairly high (.532), telling us that returns on U.S. Steel generally track those of the market index. The  $R$ -square (.283) tells us that variation

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/b6e338756a6220a60e375648026b5346855deddb7e6cec395a787fe8e9d37773.jpg)

# Table 8.1

With 60 observations, this bias is small. The standard error of the regression is the standard deviation of the residual,  $e$ . High standard errors imply greater impact (positive and negative) of firm-specific events from one month to the next.


# The Estimate of Alpha

We move now to the lower panel of Table 8.1. The intercept  $(-2.034\%)$  per month is the estimate of U.S. Steel's alpha for the sample period. Although this is an economically large value (an absolute value above  $2\%$  per month), it is not statistically significant. This can be seen from the three statistics next to the estimated coefficient. The first is the standard error of the estimate  $(2.052\%)$ . This is a measure of the imprecision of the estimate. If the standard error is large, the range of likely estimation error is correspondingly large.

The  $t$ -statistic reported in the next column is the ratio of the regression parameter to its standard error. This statistic equals the number of standard errors by which our estimate exceeds zero, and therefore can be used to assess the likelihood that the true but unobserved value might actually be zero rather than the estimate we derived from the data.

6The equation for the  $R$  -square is the ratio of the systemic variance to total variance:

$$
R \text {s q u a r e} = \frac {\beta^ {2} \sigma_ {\text {i n d e x}} ^ {2}}{\beta^ {2} \sigma_ {\text {i n d e x}} ^ {2} + \sigma^ {2} (e)}
$$

In general, the adjusted  $R$ -square  $(R_A^2)$  is derived from the unadjusted by  $R_A^2 = 1 - (1 - R^2)\frac{n - 1}{n - k - 1}$ , where  $k$  is the number of independent variables (here,  $k = 1$ ). An additional degree of freedom is lost to the estimate of the intercept.

The  $t$ -statistic is based on the assumption that returns are normally distributed. In general, if we standardize the estimate of a normally distributed variable by computing its difference from a hypothesized value and dividing by the standard error of the estimate (to express the difference as a number of standard errors), the resulting variable will have a  $t$ -distribution. With a large number of observations, the bell-shaped  $t$ -distribution approaches the normal distribution.

The intuition is that if the true value were zero, we would be unlikely to observe estimated values far away (i.e., many standard errors) from zero. So large  $t$ -statistics imply low probabilities that the true value is zero.

Given the  $t$ -statistic, we can use a table of the  $t$ -distribution (or Excel's TINV function) to find the probability that the true alpha is actually zero despite a regression estimate that differs from zero. This is alternatively called the level of significance or, as in Table 8.1, the probability or  $p$ -value. The conventional cutoff for statistical significance is a probability of less than  $5\%$ , which requires a  $t$ -statistic of about 2.0. The regression output shows that the  $t$ -statistic for U.S. Steel's alpha is -.991, not even close to the cutoff for statistical significance. In other words, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the true value of alpha equals zero. The  $p$ -value for the alpha estimate (.326) indicates that if the true alpha were zero, the probability of obtaining an estimate with an absolute value as large as 2.034 would be  $32.6\%$ . Convention is to deem a finding statistically significant only if the  $p$ -value is below  $5\%$ .

# The Estimate of Beta

The regression output in Table 8.1 shows U.S. Steel's beta estimate to be 2.030, meaning that its share price tended to move  $2.030\%$  for every  $1\%$  move in the market index. Not surprisingly, U.S. Steel's prospects appear to have above-average sensitivity to the economy. The standard error (SE) of the estimate is .424.

The value of beta and its standard error produce a large  $t$ -statistic (4.785), and a  $p$ -value of practically zero. We can confidently reject the hypothesis that U.S. Steel's true beta is zero. This is hardly surprising in light of Figure 8.1, which showed that U.S. Steel's return and that of the market index were clearly related. A more interesting  $t$ -statistic might test the hypothesis that the beta is greater than the marketwide average beta of 1. This  $t$ -statistic would measure how many standard errors separate the estimated beta from a hypothesized value of 1. The following calculation shows that the  $t$ -statistic for this hypothesis is 2.43, allowing us to reject the hypothesis that the true beta is 1.

$$
\frac {\text {E s t i m a t e d v a l u e - H y p o t h e s i z e d v a l u e}}{\text {S t a n d a r d e r r o r}} = \frac {2 . 0 3 0 - 1}{. 4 2 4} = 2. 4 3
$$

In general, precision is not what we would like it to be. For example, if we wanted to construct a confidence interval that includes the true but unobserved value of beta with  $95\%$  probability, we would take the estimated value as the center of the interval and then add and subtract about two standard errors. This produces a range between 1.182 and 2.878, which is quite wide.

# Firm-Specific Risk

The standard deviation of U.S. Steel's residual is  $15.17\%$  per month, or  $52.6\%$  annually. This is quite large, on top of its already high systematic risk. The standard deviation of systematic risk is  $\beta \times \sigma (\mathrm{index}) = 2.03\times 4.66 = 9.46\%$  per month. Notice that U.S. Steel's firm-specific risk is greater than its systematic risk, a common result for individual stocks. In other words, more of the fluctuation in its monthly return derives from firm-specific factors than from marketwide systematic factors.

Index model estimates: Regressions of excess stock returns on the excess return of the broad market index over 60 months, five years ending December 2021.

Table 8.2

Typical Results from Index Model Regressions Table 8.2 shows index model regressions for a sample of well-known companies. Notice that the average beta of the firms is 1.07, almost precisely the expected value of 1.0. As one would expect, firms with high exposure to the state of the macroeconomy (e.g., Boeing, U.S. Steel, Marathon Oil) have betas greater than 1. Firms whose business is less sensitive to the macroeconomy (e.g., Campbell Soup, Newmont Mining, McDonald's) have betas less than 1.

The average alpha for this sample is almost precisely zero. Because the average non-market risk premium is zero, we conclude that these firms, on average, were neither underpriced nor overpriced. Moreover, there are only two firms in the entire sample for which the estimate of alpha is more than twice its standard error (Exxon and Microsoft). One of these alphas is positive, and one negative. In other words, the alpha estimates, by and large, are not statistically significant.

The column titled Residual Standard Deviation is the standard deviation of the residual terms,  $e$ , and is our measure of firm-specific risk. Notice how high that risk is, averaging  $6.9\%$  per month. This reminds us again of the importance of diversification. Anyone who concentrates a portfolio in just one or a few securities is bearing an enormous amount of risk that can easily be diversified.

The high levels of firm-specific risk are reflected as well in the  $R$ -square of these regressions, which average only  $35.0\%$ . For this sample of stocks, only  $35.0\%$  of return variance in this period was due to market factors, implying that  $65.0\%$  was due to firm-specific factors.

# 8.4 The Industry Version of the Index Model

Remember that alpha is a nonmarket risk premium. It is the extra expected return on your portfolio (positive or negative) above and beyond the portion due to market exposure. A portfolio manager who has neither special information about a security nor insight that is unavailable to the general public will take the security's alpha value as zero. Using Equation 8.6, the manager will forecast a risk premium for the security equal to  $\beta_{i}E(R_{M})$ . If we restate this forecast in terms of total returns, one would expect

$$
E \left(r _ {i}\right) = r _ {f} + \beta_ {i} \left[ E \left(r _ {M}\right) - r _ {f} \right] \tag {8.15}
$$

These forecasts depend on beta estimates from regressions like that in Table 8.1. There are several sources for such regression results, for example, Yahoo! Finance or Value Line. The Web sites listed in Connect for this chapter also provide security betas.

Industry beta services, however, typically differ in a few ways from the sort of analysis we presented in Table 8.2. First, they usually use the S&P 500 rather than our broader market index as the proxy for the market factor. Second, they most often use total returns, rather than excess returns (deviations from T-bill rates), in the regressions. In this way, they estimate a variant of our index model, which is

$$ r = a + b r _ {M} + e ^ {*} \tag {8.16}
$$ instead of


$$ r - r _ {f} = \alpha + \beta \left(r _ {M} - r _ {f}\right) + e \tag {8.17}
$$

To see the effect of this departure, we can rewrite Equation 8.17 as

$$ r = r _ {f} + \alpha + \beta r _ {M} - \beta r _ {f} + e = \alpha + r _ {f} (1 - \beta) + \beta r _ {M} + e \tag {8.18}
$$

Comparing Equations 8.16 and 8.18, you can see that if  $r_f$  is constant over the sample period, both equations have the same independent variable,  $r_M$ , and residual,  $e$ . Therefore, the slope coefficient will be the same in the two regressions.

However, the intercept that most providers call ALPHA is really an estimate of  $\alpha + r_f(1 - \beta)$ . On a monthly basis,  $r_f(1 - \beta)$  is small and is likely to be swamped by the volatility of actual stock returns. But it is worth noting that for  $\beta \neq 1$ , the regression intercept in Equation 8.16 will not equal the index model  $\alpha$  as it does when excess returns are used, as in Equation 8.17.

# Concept Check 8.4

Table 8.2 shows that the estimate of Newmont Mining's index-model  $\alpha$  (per month) regression was  $1.1\%$ . If the monthly T-bill rate during this period was  $2\%$ , then what would you predict would be the value of ALPHA given in a standard industry report?

Always remember as well that these alpha estimates are ex post (after the fact) measures. They do not mean that anyone could have forecast these alpha values ex ante

(before the fact). In fact, the name of the game in security analysis is to forecast alpha values ahead of time. A well-constructed portfolio that includes long positions in future positive-alpha stocks and short positions in future negative-alpha stocks will outperform the market index. The key term here is "well constructed," meaning that the portfolio has to balance concentration on high-alpha stocks with the need for risk-reducing diversification. This trade-off is discussed in the next section.

The last column in Table 8.2 is called Adjusted Beta. The motivation for adjusting beta estimates is that, as an empirical matter, beta coefficients seem to move toward 1 over time. One explanation for this phenomenon is intuitive. A business enterprise usually is established to produce a specific product or service, and a new firm may be more unconventional than an older one in many ways, from technology to management style. As it grows, however, a firm often diversifies, first expanding to similar products and later to more diverse operations. As the firm becomes more conventional, it starts to resemble the rest of the economy even more. Thus, its beta coefficient will tend to change in the direction of 1.

Another explanation is statistical. We know that the average beta over all securities is 1. Thus, before estimating the beta of a security, our best forecast would be that it is 1. When we estimate this beta coefficient over a particular sample period, we inevitably sustain some unknown sampling error in the estimated beta. The greater the difference between our beta estimate and 1, the greater is the chance that we have incurred a large estimation error and that beta in a subsequent sample period will be closer to 1.

The estimate of the beta coefficient is the best guess for that particular sample period. Given that beta has a tendency to evolve toward 1, however, a forecast of the future beta coefficient should adjust the sample estimate in that direction.

Table 8.2 adjusts beta estimates in a simple way. $^{10}$  It takes the sample estimate of beta and averages it with 1, using weights of two-thirds and one-third:

$$
\text {A d j u s t e d} = \frac {2}{3} \text {e s t i m a t e d} + \frac {1}{3} (1. 0) \tag {8.19}
$$

# Example 8.1 Adjusted Beta

In Table 8.2, U.S. Steel's beta was estimated at 2.030. Therefore, its adjusted beta is  $\frac{1}{3} \times 2.030 + \frac{1}{3} \times 1 = 1.687$ , taking it a third of the way toward 1.

In the absence of special information concerning U.S. Steel (i.e., setting alpha = 0), if our forecast for the return on the market index is  $8\%$  and T-bills pay  $2\%$ , we will forecast the rate of return on U.S. Steel as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} E \left(r _ {x}\right) = r _ {f} + \text {A d j u s t e d b e t a} \times \left[ E \left(r _ {M}\right) - r _ {f} \right] \\ = 2 + 1.687(8 - 2) = 12.12\% \\ \end{array}
$$

# Predicting Betas

Adjusted betas are a simple way to recognize that betas estimated from past data may not be the best estimates of future betas: Betas seem to drift toward 1 over time. This suggests that we might want a forecasting model for beta.

One simple approach would be to collect data on beta in different periods and then estimate a regression equation:

$$
\text {C u r r e n t} = a + b (\text {P a s t} \beta) \tag {8.20}
$$

Given estimates of  $a$  and  $b$ , we would then forecast future betas using the rule

$$
F o r e c a s t \beta e t a = a + b (\text {C u r r e n t} \beta e t a) \tag {8.21}
$$

There is no reason, however, to limit ourselves to such simple forecasting rules. Why not also investigate the predictive power of other financial variables in forecasting beta? For example, if we believe that firm size and debt ratios are two determinants of beta, we might specify an expanded version of Equation 8.20 and estimate

$$
\text {C u r r e n t} = a + b _ {1} (\text {P a s t} \beta a) + b _ {2} (\text {F i r m} \text {s i z e}) + b _ {3} (\text {D e t h} \text {r a t i o})
$$

Now we would use estimates of  $a$  as well as  $b_{1}$  through  $b_{3}$  to forecast future betas.

Such an approach was suggested in an early study by Rosenberg and Guy, $^{11}$  who found the following variables to help predict betas:

1. Variance of earnings.
2. Variance of cash flow.
3. Growth in earnings per share.
4. Market capitalization (firm size).
5. Dividend yield.
6. Debt-to-asset ratio.

They also found that even after controlling for a firm's financial characteristics, industry group helps to predict beta. For example, they found that the beta values of gold mining companies are, on average, .827 lower than would be predicted based on financial characteristics alone. This should not be surprising; the -.827 "adjustment factor" for the gold industry reflects the fact that gold values have low or even negative correlation with market returns.

Table 8.3 presents beta estimates and adjustment factors for a subset of firms in the Rosenberg and Guy study.

# 8.5 Portfolio Construction Using the Single-Index Model

In this section, we look at the implications of the index model for portfolio construction. These techniques were originally developed by Jack Treynor and Fischer Black and are commonly called the Treynor-Black model. $^{12}$  Our goal is the same as in the previous chapter, the formation of portfolios with an efficient risk-return trade-off, but given the simplification offered by the index model, our techniques will be different. We will see that the index model offers several advantages, not only in terms of parameter estimation, but also for the analytic simplification and organizational decentralization that it makes possible.

# Alpha and Security Analysis

Perhaps the most important advantage of the single-index model is the framework it provides for macroeconomic and security analysis in the preparation of the input list that is so critical to the efficiency of the optimal portfolio. The Markowitz model requires estimates of risk premiums for each security. The estimate of expected return depends on both macroeconomic and individual-firm forecasts. But if many different analysts perform security analysis for a large organization such as a mutual fund company, a likely result is inconsistency in the macroeconomic forecasts that partly underlie expectations of returns across securities.

The single-index model creates a framework that separates these two quite different sources of return variation and makes it easier to ensure consistency across analysts. We can lay down a hierarchy of the preparation of the input list using the framework of the single-index model.

1. Macroeconomic analysis is used to estimate the risk premium and risk of the market index.
2. Statistical analysis is used to estimate the beta coefficients of all securities and their residual variances,  $\sigma^2 (e_i)$
3. The portfolio manager uses the estimates for the market-index risk premium and the beta coefficient of a security to establish the expected return of that security absent any contribution from security analysis. This purely market-driven expected return is conditional on information common to all securities, not on information gleaned from security analysis of particular firms.
4. Security-specific expected return forecasts (specifically, security alphas) are derived from various security-valuation models (such as those discussed in Part Five). Thus, the alpha value distills the incremental risk premium attributable to private information.

Equation 8.6 tells us that the risk premium on a security not subject to security analysis would be  $\beta_{i}E(R_{M})$ . The risk premium would derive solely from the security's tendency to follow the market index. Any alpha (i.e., an expected return beyond this benchmark risk premium) would be due to some nonmarket factor uncovered through security analysis.

The end result of security analysis is a list of alpha values. Statistical methods of estimating beta coefficients are widely known and standardized; hence, we would not expect this portion of the input list to differ greatly across portfolio managers. In contrast, security analysis is far less routine and therefore provides the potential for distinguished performance. Using the index model to disentangle the premiums due to market and nonmarket factors, a portfolio manager can be confident that the security analysts forecasting alpha values are all using consistent estimates for the overall market.

In the context of portfolio construction, alpha is more than just one of the components of expected return. It is the key variable that tells us whether a security is a good or a bad buy. Consider an individual stock for which we have a beta estimate derived from regression analysis and an alpha value from security analysis. We easily can find many other securities with identical betas and therefore identical systematic components of their risk premiums. Therefore, what really makes a security attractive or unattractive to a portfolio manager is its alpha value, its return premium over and above the premium derived from its tendency to track the market index. A positive-alpha security is a bargain and therefore should be overweighted in the overall portfolio. Conversely, a negative-alpha security is overpriced and, other things equal, its portfolio weight should be reduced. In more extreme cases, the desired portfolio weight might even be negative; that is, a short position (if permitted) would be desirable.

# The Index Portfolio as an Investment Asset

Suppose the prospectus of an investment company limits the universe of assets in which the firm may invest to only stocks included in the S&P 500 index. The resources of the company allow coverage of only a relatively small subset of this so-called investable universe. If only these analyzed firms are allowed in the portfolio, the portfolio manager may well be worried about limited diversification.

A simple way to avoid inadequate diversification would be to include the market index in the portfolio. Examination of Equations 8.5 and 8.6 reveals that if we treat the S&P 500 portfolio as the market index, it will have a beta of 1.0 (its sensitivity to itself), no firm-specific risk, and an alpha of zero—there is no nonmarket component in its expected return. Equation 8.7 shows that the covariance of any security,  $i$ , with the market index (in this example, the S&P 500) is  $\beta_{i}\sigma_{M}^{2}$ . To distinguish the S&P 500 from the  $n$  securities actively analyzed by the firm, we will designate it as the  $(n + 1)$ th asset. We can think of the S&P 500 as a passive portfolio that the manager would select in the absence of security analysis. It gives broad market exposure without requiring expensive security analysis. However, if managers are willing to engage in such research, they may be able to devise an active portfolio that can be mixed with the index to provide an even better risk-return trade-off.

# The Single-Index Model Input List

Compiling a portfolio from a list of  $n$  actively researched firms plus a passive market-index portfolio such as the S&P 500 requires the following input list:

1. Risk premium on the S&P 500 portfolio.
2. Standard deviation of the S&P 500 portfolio.
3.  $n$  sets of estimates of (a) beta coefficients, (b) stock residual variances, and (c) alpha values. The alpha values, together with the risk premium of the S&P 500 and the beta of each security, determine the expected excess return on each security.

# The Optimal Risky Portfolio in the Single-Index Model

The single-index model allows us to solve for the optimal risky portfolio and to gain insight into the nature of the solution. First, we confirm that we easily can set up the optimization process to construct the efficient frontier in this framework along the lines of the Markowitz model.

With the estimates of the beta and alpha coefficients, plus the risk premium of the index portfolio, we can generate the  $n + 1$  expected returns using Equation 8.6. With the estimates of the beta coefficients and residual variances, together with the variance of the index portfolio, we can construct the covariance matrix using Equation 8.7. Given the column of risk premiums and the covariance matrix, we can conduct the optimization program described in Chapter 7.

While the index model allows us to more easily implement the Markowitz model for efficient diversification (the focus of Chapter 7), we can take its description of how diversification works a step further. We showed earlier that the alpha, beta, and residual variance of an equally weighted portfolio are the simple averages of those parameters across component securities. This result is not limited to equally weighted portfolios. It applies to any portfolio, where we need only replace "simple average" with "weighted average," using the portfolio weights. Specifically,

$$
\alpha_ {P} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n + 1} w _ {i} \alpha_ {i} \quad \text {a n d f o r t h e i n d e x ,} \alpha_ {n + 1} = \alpha_ {M} = 0
$$

$$
\beta_ {P} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n + 1} w _ {i} \beta_ {i} \quad \text {a n d f o r t h e i n d e x ,} \beta_ {n + 1} = \beta_ {M} = 1 \tag {8.22}
$$

$$
\sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {P}\right) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n + 1} w _ {i} ^ {2} \sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {i}\right) \text {a n d f o r t h e i n d e x ,} \sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {n + 1}\right) = \sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {M}\right) = 0
$$

The objective is to select portfolio weights,  $w_{1}, \ldots, w_{n+1}$ , to maximize the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio. With this set of weights, the expected return, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio of the portfolio are

$$
E (R _ {P}) = \alpha_ {P} + E (R _ {M}) \beta_ {P} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n + 1} w _ {i} \alpha_ {i} + E (R _ {M}) \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n + 1} w _ {i} \beta_ {i}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {P} = \left[ \beta_ {P} ^ {2} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} + \sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {P}\right) \right] ^ {1 / 2} = \left[ \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n + 1} w _ {i} \beta_ {i}\right) ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n + 1} w _ {i} ^ {2} \sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {i}\right) \right] ^ {1 / 2} \tag {8.23}
$$

$$
S _ {P} = \frac {E (R _ {P})}{\sigma_ {P}}
$$

At this point, as in the Markowitz procedure, we could use Excel's optimization program to maximize the Sharpe ratio subject to the adding-up constraint that the portfolio weights sum to 1. However, this is not necessary because when returns follow the index model, the optimal portfolio can be derived explicitly, and the solution for the optimal portfolio provides insight into the efficient use of security analysis in portfolio construction. It is instructive to outline the logical thread of the solution. We will not show every algebraic step, but will instead present the major results and interpretation of the procedure.

Before delving into the results, let us first preview the basic trade-off revealed by the model. If we were interested only in diversification, we would just hold the market index. But security analysis gives us the chance to uncover securities with a nonzero alpha and to take a differential position in those securities. The cost of weighting underpriced securities is a departure from efficient diversification, specifically, the assumption of unnecessary firm-specific risk. The model shows us that the optimal risky portfolio trades off the search for alpha against the departure from efficient diversification.


The optimal risky portfolio turns out to be a combination of two component portfolios: (1) an active portfolio, denoted by  $A$ , comprising the  $n$  analyzed securities (we call this the active portfolio because it follows from active security analysis), and (2) the market-index portfolio, the  $(n + 1)$ th asset we include to aid in diversification, which we call the passive portfolio and denote by  $M$ .

Assume first that the active portfolio has a beta of 1, the same as the index. In that case, the optimal weight in the active portfolio would be proportional to the ratio  $\alpha_{A} / \sigma^{2}(e_{A})$ . This ratio balances the contribution of the active portfolio to risk-adjusted return (its alpha) against its contribution to portfolio variance (via its residual variance). The analogous ratio for the index portfolio is  $E(R_{M}) / \sigma_{M}^{2}$ , and hence the initial position in the active portfolio (by "initial position," we mean if its beta were 1) is

$$ w _ {A} ^ {0} = \frac {\alpha_ {A} / \sigma_ {A} ^ {2}}{E \left(R _ {M}\right) / \sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} \tag {8.24}
$$

Next, we adjust this position to account for the beta of the active portfolio. It turns out that as the beta of the active portfolio increases, its weight in the overall optimal risky portfolio correspondingly increases. The intuition for this result is that if the active portfolio has a higher beta, it more aggressively mimics market performance; because the active position now gives you more market exposure, it crowds out the index portfolio in the overall risky portfolio and thus takes a larger share itself. The precise modification for the position in the active portfolio is

$$ w _ {A} ^ {*} = \frac {w _ {A} ^ {0}}{1 + (1 - \beta_ {A}) w _ {A} ^ {0}} \tag {8.25}
$$

Notice that when  $\beta_{A} = 1, w_{A}^{*} = w_{A}^{0}$ .

# The Information Ratio

Equations 8.24 and 8.25 yield the optimal position in the active portfolio once we know its alpha, beta, and residual variance. With  $w_{A}^{*}$  in the active portfolio and  $1 - w_{A}^{*}$  invested in the index portfolio, we can compute the expected return, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio of the optimal risky portfolio. The Sharpe ratio of an optimally constructed risky portfolio will exceed that of the index portfolio (the passive strategy). The exact relationship is

$$
S _ {P} ^ {2} = S _ {M} ^ {2} + \left[ \frac {\alpha_ {A}}{\sigma (e _ {A})} \right] ^ {2} \tag {8.26}
$$

Equation 8.26 shows us that the contribution of the active portfolio (when held in its optimal weight,  $w_{A}^{*}$ ) to the Sharpe ratio of the overall risky portfolio is determined by the ratio of its alpha to its residual standard deviation. This important ratio is widely known as the information ratio. $^{14}$  It measures the extra return we can obtain from security analysis compared to the firm-specific risk we incur when we over- or underweight securities relative to the passive market index. Equation 8.26 therefore implies that to maximize the overall Sharpe ratio, we must maximize the information ratio of the active portfolio. It turns out that the information ratio of the active portfolio will be maximized if we invest in each security in proportion to its ratio of  $\alpha_{i} / \sigma^{2}(e_{i})$ .


This result has a compelling interpretation: It says that the position in each security will be proportional to its ratio of alpha (which investors seek) to diversifiable risk (which they wish to avoid). The higher the ratio, the more of the security they will hold in the active portfolio. Scaling this ratio so that the total position in the active portfolio adds up to  $w_{A}^{*}$ , the weight in each security is

$$ w _ {i} ^ {*} = w _ {A} ^ {*} \frac {\alpha_ {i} / \sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {i}\right)}{\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \frac {\alpha_ {i}}{\sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {i}\right)}} \tag {8.27}
$$

With this set of weights, the contribution of each security to the squared information ratio of the active portfolio is the square of its own information ratio, that is,

$$
\left[ \frac {\alpha_ {A}}{\sigma \left(e _ {A}\right)} \right] ^ {2} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \left[ \frac {\alpha_ {i}}{\sigma \left(e _ {i}\right)} \right] ^ {2} \tag {8.28}
$$

The model thus reveals the central role of the information ratio in efficiently taking advantage of security analysis. The positive contribution of a security to the active portfolio is made by its addition to the nonmarket risk premium (its alpha). Its negative impact is to increase the portfolio variance through its firm-specific risk (residual variance).

In contrast to alpha, the market (systematic) component of the risk premium,  $\beta_{i}E(R_{M})$ , is offset by the security's nondiversifiable (market) risk,  $\beta_{i}^{2}\sigma_{M}^{2}$ , and both are driven by the same beta. This trade-off is not unique to any security, as any security with the same beta makes the same balanced contribution to both risk and return. Put differently, the beta of a security is neither vice nor virtue. It is a property that simultaneously affects the risk and risk premium of a security.

We see from Equation 8.27 that if a security's alpha is negative, the security will assume a short position in the active portfolio. If short positions are prohibited, a negative-alpha security would simply be taken out of the optimization program and assigned a portfolio weight of zero. As the number of securities with nonzero alpha values (or the number with positive alphas if short positions are prohibited) increases, the active portfolio will itself be better diversified and its weight in the overall risky portfolio will increase at the expense of the passive index portfolio.

Finally, we note that the index portfolio is an efficient portfolio only if all alpha values are zero. This makes intuitive sense. Unless security analysis reveals that a security has a nonzero alpha, including it in the active portfolio would make the portfolio less attractive. In addition to the security's systematic risk, which is compensated for by the market risk premium (through beta), the security would add its firm-specific risk to portfolio variance. With a zero alpha, however, there is no compensation for bearing that firm-specific risk.

Hence, if all securities have zero alphas, the optimal weight in the active portfolio will be zero, and the weight in the index portfolio will be 1. However, when security analysis uncovers securities with nonmarket risk premiums (nonzero alphas), the index portfolio is no longer efficient.

# Summary of Optimization Procedure

Once security analysis is complete, the optimal risky portfolio is formed from the index-model estimates of security and market index parameters using these steps:

1. Compute the initial position of each security in the active portfolio as  $w_{i}^{0} = \alpha_{i} / \sigma^{2}(e_{i})$ .
2. Scale those initial positions to force portfolio weights to sum to 1 by dividing by their sum, that is,  $w_{i} = \frac{w_{i}^{0}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i}^{0}}$ .
3. Compute the alpha of the active portfolio:  $\alpha_{A} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_{i}\alpha_{i}$
4. Compute the residual variance of the active portfolio:  $\sigma^2 (e_A) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_i^2\sigma^2 (e_i)$
5. Compute the initial position in the active portfolio:  $w_{A}^{0} = \left[\frac{\alpha_{A} / \sigma^{2}(e_{A})}{E(R_{M}) / \sigma_{M}^{2}}\right]$ .
6. Compute the beta of the active portfolio:  $\beta_{A} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_{i}\beta_{i}$
7. Adjust the initial position in the active portfolio:  $w_{A}^{*} = \frac{w_{A}^{0}}{1 + (1 - \beta_{A})w_{A}^{0}}$ .
8. Note: The optimal risky portfolio now has weights  $w_{M}^{*} = 1 - w_{A}^{*}$  and  $w_{i}^{*} = w_{A}^{*}w_{i}$ .
9. Calculate the risk premium of the optimal risky portfolio from the risk premium of the index portfolio and the alpha of the active portfolio:

[ E(R_{P}) = (w_{M}^{*} + w_{A}^{*}\beta_{A})E(R_{M}) + w_{A}^{*}\alpha_{A}. ] Notice that the beta of the risky portfolio is  $w_{M}^{*} + w_{A}^{*}\beta_{A}$  because the beta of the index portfolio is 1.

10. Compute the variance of the optimal risky portfolio from the variance of the index portfolio and the residual variance of the active portfolio:

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = (w _ {M} ^ {*} + w _ {A} ^ {*} \beta_ {A}) ^ {2} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} + [ w _ {A} ^ {*} \sigma (e _ {A}) ] ^ {2}.
$$

# An Example

We can illustrate the implementation of the index model by constructing an optimal portfolio using the procedure just outlined. To keep the presentation manageable, we will imagine that the investor is limited to an "investment universe" comprising only the market index and the following six large U.S. corporations: Verizon and AT&T from the telecommunications industry, Target and Walmart from the retailing sector, and Ford and GM from the automobile industry. This example entails only six analyzed stocks, but by virtue of selecting three pairs of firms from the same industry with relatively high residual correlations, we put the index model to a severe test. This is because the model ignores the correlation between residuals when producing estimates for the covariance matrix. By ignoring that correlation, the index model will surely underestimate covariances across securities.

high volatility and inferior Sharpe ratios. You can see from these high residual monthly standard deviations the great importance of diversification.

Panel B shows the correlation matrix of the residuals from the regressions of excess returns on the market index. The shaded cells show correlations of pairs of stocks from the same industries, which are as high as .7 for the two auto stocks (GM and Ford). This is in contrast to the assumption of the index model that all residuals are uncorrelated. Of course, these correlations are, to a great extent, high by design because we intentionally selected pairs of firms from the same industry. Cross-industry correlations are typically far smaller, and the empirical estimates of correlations of residuals for industry indexes (rather than individual stocks in the same industry) would be far more in accord with the index model. In fact, a few of the stocks in this sample actually appear to have negatively correlated residuals. Of course, correlation also is subject to statistical sampling error, and this may be a fluke.

Panel C produces covariances (derived from Equation 8.7) of the single-index model. Variances of the market index and the individual covered stocks appear in the shaded diagonal entries. The variance estimates for the individual stocks equal  $\beta_i^2\sigma_M^2 +\sigma^2 (e_i)$ . The off-diagonal terms are covariance values and equal  $\beta_{i}\beta_{j}\sigma_{M}^{2}$ .

Risk Premium Forecasts Panel D of Spreadsheet 8.1 contains estimates of alpha and the risk premium for each stock. These alphas would be the most important product of the investment company in a real-life procedure. Statistics plays a small role here; in this arena, macro/security analysis is king. In this example, we simply use illustrative values to demonstrate the portfolio construction process and possible results. You may wonder why we have chosen such small forecast alpha values. The reason is that even when security analysis appears to uncover meaningful mispricing, that is, large alpha values, these forecasts must be substantially trimmed to account for the fact that such forecasts are subject to large estimation error. We discuss the important procedure of adjusting actual forecasts in Chapter 27.

The Optimal Risky Portfolio Panel E of Spreadsheet 8.1 displays calculations for the optimal risky portfolio. They follow the summary outlined above (you should try to replicate these calculations in your own spreadsheet). In this example, we allow short sales. Notice that the weight of each security in the active portfolio (see row 55) has the same sign as the alpha value. Allowing short sales, the positions in the active portfolio are quite large (e.g., the position in Walmart is .6850, see cell D48); this is an aggressive portfolio. As a result, the alpha of the active portfolio  $(2.42\%)$  is larger than that of any of the individual alpha forecasts. However, this aggressive stance also results in a large residual variance, .0303, which corresponds to a residual standard deviation of  $17.4\%$ . Therefore, the position in the active portfolio in the overall risky portfolio is scaled down considerably (see Equation 8.24) and ends up quite modest (.1809; cell C55), reinforcing the notion that diversification considerations are paramount in building the optimal risky portfolio.

The optimal risky portfolio (which combines the active portfolio with the market index) has a risk premium of  $6.05\%$ , standard deviation of  $11.72\%$ , and a Sharpe ratio of .5165 (cells J58-J60). By comparison, the Sharpe ratio of the index portfolio is .06/.1206 = .4975 (cell B60), which is not far below that of the optimal risky portfolio. The small improvement is a result of the modest alpha forecasts that we used. In Chapter 11 on market efficiency and Chapter 24 on performance evaluation, we demonstrate that such results are common in the mutual fund industry. Of course, a few portfolio managers can and do produce portfolios with better performance.

Figure 8.4 Efficient frontier constructed from the index model and the full-covariance matrix

The interesting question here is the extent to which the index model produces results that differ from that of the full-covariance (Markowitz) model. Figure 8.4 shows the efficient frontiers from the two models with the example data. (We emphasize again that the difference in these figures reflects different estimates of covariances, not differences in investors' actual ability to trade off risk against return. The index model appears to offer greater opportunity for risk reduction, but that is only because it assumes zero covariance among residuals, which, if true, would increase the power of diversification.) However, for standard deviations above  $10\%$ , the efficient frontiers are in fact similar.

Table 8.4 compares the composition and expected performance of the optimal risky portfolios derived from the two models. The portfolio weights using the full-covariance matrix take advantage of the correlation among residuals. For example, Walmart has a positive alpha and Target has a negative alpha, so Walmart is held long and Target is sold short. Because the residuals of the two firms are positively correlated, the full-covariance model dictates a more extreme positive position in Walmart and a more extreme negative position in Target than the index model, relying on the correlation between the two firms to offset the risk from those higher long-short positions. In the end, however, the suggested portfolio weights are not so different, and the optimal risky portfolio from the full-covariance (Markowitz) model has only slightly greater estimated risk premium and slightly greater estimated standard deviation. The Sharpe ratios are nearly identical. Even in this example, where we challenged the index model by applying it to pairs of

Is the Index Model Inferior to the Full-Covariance Model? At one level, the index model must be inferior to the full-blown Markowitz model: It imposes additional assumptions that may not be fully accurate. But as our example illustrates, it is far from clear that the index model will be inferior in practical applications.

In addition, practical issues in statistical estimation weaken the case for the full-blown Markowitz model. The Markowitz model allows far more flexibility in our modeling of asset covariance structure compared to the single-index model. But that advantage may be illusory if we can't estimate those covariances with a sufficient degree of accuracy. Using the full-covariance matrix invokes estimation risk of thousands of terms. Even if the full Markowitz model would be better in principle, it is quite possible that the cumulative effect of so many estimation errors will result in a portfolio that is actually inferior to that derived from the single-index model.

Against the potential superiority of the full-covariance model, we have the clear practical advantage of the single-index framework. Its aid in decentralizing macro and security analysis is another decisive advantage.

1. A single-factor model of the economy classifies sources of uncertainty as systematic (macro-economic) factors or firm-specific (microeconomic) factors. The index model assumes that the macro factor can be represented by a broad index of stock returns.
2. The single-index model drastically reduces the necessary inputs in the Markowitz portfolio selection procedure. It also aids in specialization of labor in security analysis.
3. According to the index model specification, the systematic risk of a portfolio or asset equals  $\beta^2\sigma_M^2$  and the covariance between two assets equals  $\beta_i\beta_j\sigma_M^2$ .
4. The index model is estimated by applying regression analysis to excess rates of return. The slope of the regression curve is the beta of an asset, whereas the intercept is the asset's alpha during the sample period. The regression line is also called the security characteristic line.
5. Practitioners routinely estimate the index model using total rather than excess rates of return. This makes their estimate of alpha equal to  $\alpha + r_f(1 - \beta)$ .
6. Betas show a tendency to evolve toward 1 over time. Beta forecasting rules attempt to predict this drift. Moreover, other financial variables can be used to help forecast betas.
7. Optimal active portfolios include analyzed securities in direct proportion to their alpha and in inverse proportion to their firm-specific variance. The full risky portfolio is a mixture of the active portfolio and the passive market-index portfolio. The index portfolio is used to enhance the diversification of the overall risky position.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1.  $a$ . Total market capitalization is  $3,000 + 1,940 + 1,360 = 6,300$ . Therefore, the mean excess return of the index portfolio is

$$
\frac{3,000}{6,300}\times 10 + \frac{1,940}{6,300}\times 2 + \frac{1,360}{6,300}\times 17 = 9.05\%
$$

$b$ . The covariance between stocks  $A$  and  $B$  equals

$$
\operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {A}, R _ {B}\right) = \beta_ {A} \beta_ {B} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} = 1 \times . 2 \times 2 5 ^ {2} = 1 2 5
$$

$c$ . The covariance between stock  $B$  and the index portfolio equals

$$
\operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {B}, R _ {M}\right) = \beta_ {B} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} = . 2 \times 2 5 ^ {2} = 1 2 5
$$

$d$ . The total variance of  $B$  equals

$$
\sigma_ {B} ^ {2} = \operatorname {V a r} \left(\beta_ {B} R _ {M} + e _ {B}\right) = \beta_ {B} ^ {2} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} + \sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {B}\right)
$$

The systematic component of risk equals  $\beta_B^2\sigma_M^2 = .2^2\times 25^2 = 25$

Thus, the firm-specific variance of  $B$  equals

$$
\sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {B}\right) = \sigma_ {B} ^ {2} - \beta_ {B} ^ {2} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} = 3 0 ^ {2} - . 2 ^ {2} \times 2 5 ^ {2} = 8 7 5
$$

2. The variance of each stock is  $\beta^2\sigma_M^2 +\sigma^2 (e)$

For stock  $A$ , we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {A} ^ {2} = . 9 ^ {2} (2 0) ^ {2} + 3 0 ^ {2} = 1, 2 2 4 \\ \sigma_ {A} = 35 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

For stock  $B$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {B} ^ {2} = 1. 1 ^ {2} (2 0) ^ {2} + 1 0 ^ {2} = 5 8 4 \\ \sigma_ {B} = 24 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

The covariance is

$$
\beta_ {A} \beta_ {B} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} = . 9 \times 1. 1 \times 2 0 ^ {2} = 3 9 6
$$

3.  $\sigma^2 (e_P) = (\frac{1}{2})^2 [\sigma^2 (e_A) + \sigma^2 (e_B)]$

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 1 / 4 (3 0 ^ {2} + 1 0 ^ {2}) \\ = 2 5 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

Therefore,  $\sigma (e_p) = \sqrt{(250)} = 15.8\%$

4. The industry-style ALPHA is related to the index-model  $\alpha$  by

$$
\mathrm {A L P H A} = \alpha_ {\text {i n d e x m o d e l}} + (1 - \beta) r _ {f}
$$

For Newmont Mining,  $\alpha = 1.1\%$ ,  $\beta = .217$ , and we are told that  $r_f$  was  $0.2\%$  per month. Thus,  $\mathrm{ALPHA} = 1.1 + (1 - .217) \times 0.2\% = 1.257\%$ .

The index model and industry ALPHA are quite close in this case because  $r_f$  was so small during this sample period.

5. The industries with positive adjustment factors are most sensitive to the economy. Their betas would be expected to be higher because the business risk of the firms is higher. In contrast, the industries with negative adjustment factors are in business fields with a lower sensitivity to the economy. Therefore, for any given financial profile, their betas are lower.

# The Capital Asset Pricing Model

# 9

THE CAPITAL ASSET pricing model, almost always referred to as the CAPM, is one of the centerpieces of modern financial economics. The model gives us a precise prediction of the relationship that we should observe between the risk of an asset and its expected return. This relationship serves two vital functions. First, it provides a benchmark rate of return for evaluating possible investments. For example, if we are analyzing securities, we might be interested in whether the expected return we forecast for a stock is more or less than its "fair" return given its risk. Second, the model helps us to make an educated guess as to the expected return on assets that have not yet been traded in the marketplace. For example, how do we price an initial public offering of stock? How will a major new investment project affect the return investors require on a company's stock?


Although the CAPM does not fully withstand empirical tests, it is widely used because of the insight it offers. All generalizations of the model retain its central conclusion that only systematic risk will be rewarded with a risk premium. While the best way to measure that systematic risk can be subtle, all the more complex cousins of the basic CAPM can be viewed as variations on this fundamental theme.

# 9.1 The Capital Asset Pricing Model

The capital asset pricing model is a set of predictions concerning equilibrium expected returns on risky assets. Harry Markowitz laid down the foundation of modern portfolio management in 1952. The CAPM was published 12 years later in articles by William Sharpe, $^{1}$  John Lintner, $^{2}$  and Jan Mossin. $^{3}$  The time for this gestation indicates that the leap from Markowitz's portfolio selection model to the CAPM is not trivial.

William Sharpe, "Capital Asset Prices: A Theory of Market Equilibrium," Journal of Finance, September 1964.
2John Lintner, "The Valuation of Risk Assets and the Selection of Risky Investments in Stock Portfolios and Capital Budgets," Review of Economics and Statistics, February 1965.
$^{3}$ Jan Mossin, "Equilibrium in a Capital Asset Market," Econometrica, October 1966.

The CAPM is based on two sets of assumptions, listed in Table 9.1. The first set pertains to investor behavior and allows us to assume that investors are alike in most important ways, specifically that they are all mean-variance optimizers with a common time horizon and a common set of information reflected in their use of an identical input list. The second set of assumptions pertains to the market setting, asserting that markets are well-functioning with few impediments to trading. Even a cursory consideration of these assumptions reveals that they are fairly strong, and one may justifiably wonder whether a theory derived from them will withstand empirical tests. Therefore, we will devote considerable attention later in the chapter to how the predictions of the model may change when one or more of these restrictive assumptions are relaxed.

Still, the simple version of the CAPM is a good place to start. While the appropriate quantification of risk and the prediction for the exact risk-return trade-off may differ across more sophisticated variants of the model, the central implication of the basic model, that risk premia will be proportional to exposure to systematic risk and independent of firm-specific risk, remains generally valid in its extensions. In part because of this commonality, the simple CAPM remains in wide use despite its empirical shortcomings.

Therefore, we begin by supposing that all investors optimize their portfolios using the Markowitz model of efficient diversification. That is, each investor uses an input list (expected returns and covariance matrix) to draw an efficient frontier employing all available risky assets and identifies an efficient risky portfolio,  $P$ , by drawing the tangent CAL (capital allocation line) to the frontier as in Figure 9.1, Panel A. As a result, each investor holds securities in the investable universe with weights arrived at by the Markowitz optimization process. Notice that this framework employs Assumptions 1(a) (investors are all mean-variance optimizers), 2(a) (all assets trade and therefore can be held in investors' portfolios), and 2(b) (investors can borrow or lend at the risk-free rate and therefore can select portfolios from the capital allocation line of the tangency portfolio).

The CAPM asks what would happen if all investors shared an identical investable universe and used the same input list to draw their efficient frontiers. The use of a common input list obviously requires Assumption 1(c), but notice that it also relies on Assumption 1(b), that each investor is optimizing for a common investment horizon. It also implicitly assumes that investor choices will not be affected by differences in tax rates or trading costs that could affect net rates of return (Assumptions 2[c] and 2[d]).

# The Market Portfolio

Not surprisingly in light of our assumptions, investors would calculate identical efficient frontiers of risky assets. Facing the same risk-free rate (Assumption 2[b]), they would

# Table 9.1

The assumptions of the CAPM

1. Individual behavior a. Investors are rational, mean-variance optimizers.

b. Their common planning horizon is a single period.
c. Investors all use identical input lists, an assumption often termed homogeneous expectations. Homogeneous expectations are consistent with the assumption that all relevant information is publicly available.

2. Market structure a. All assets are publicly held and trade on public exchanges.

b. Investors can borrow or lend at a common risk-free rate, and they can take short positions on traded securities.
c. No taxes.
d. No trading costs.

then draw an identical tangent CAL and naturally all would arrive at the same risky portfolio,  $P$ . All investors therefore would choose the same set of weights for each risky asset. What must be these weights?

A key insight of the CAPM is this: Because the market portfolio is the aggregation of all investors' risky portfolios, each of which is identical, it too will have those same weights. (Notice that this conclusion relies on Assumption 2[a] because it requires that all assets can be traded and included in investors' portfolios.) Therefore, if all investors choose the same risky portfolio, it must be the market portfolio, that is, the value-weighted portfolio of all assets in the investable universe.

The proportion of each stock in this portfolio equals the market value of the stock (price per share times number of shares outstanding) divided by the sum of the market value of all stocks. This implies that if the weight of Microsoft stock, for example, in each common risky portfolio is  $1\%$ , then Microsoft also will constitute  $1\%$  of the market portfolio. The same principle applies to the proportion of any stock in each investor's risky portfolio. As a result, the optimal risky portfolio of all investors is simply a share of the market portfolio in Figure 9.1.

We conclude that the capital allocation line based on each investor's

A: The Efficient Frontier of Risky Assets with the Optimal CAL
B: The Efficient Frontier and the Capital Market Line optimal risky portfolio will in fact also be the capital market line, as depicted in Figure 9.1, Panel B. This implication will allow us to say much about the risk-return trade-off.

Figure 9.1 Capital allocation line and the capital market line


Now suppose that the optimal portfolio of our investors does not include the stock of some company, such as Delta Airlines. When all investors avoid Delta stock, the demand is zero, and Delta's price takes a free fall. As Delta stock gets progressively cheaper, it becomes ever more attractive and other stocks look relatively less attractive. Ultimately, Delta reaches a price where it is attractive enough to include in the optimal stock portfolio.

Such a price adjustment process guarantees that all stocks will be included in the optimal portfolio. It shows that all assets have to be included in the market portfolio. The only issue is the price at which investors will be willing to include a stock in their optimal risky portfolio.

# The Passive Strategy Is Efficient

In Chapter 6 we defined the capital market line (CML) as the CAL that is constructed from a money market account (or T-bills) and the market portfolio. Now you can fully appreciate why the CML is an interesting CAL. In the simple world of the CAPM, the market portfolio,  $M$ , is the optimal tangency portfolio on the efficient frontier.

In this scenario, the market portfolio held by all investors is based on the common input list, which incorporates all relevant information about the universe of securities. This means that investors can skip the trouble of doing security analysis—they can obtain an efficient portfolio simply by holding the market portfolio. (Of course, if everyone were to follow this strategy, no one would perform security analysis and this result would no longer hold. We discuss this issue in greater depth in Chapter 11 on market efficiency.)

If security analysis, which is the heart of active investment policy, is not advantageous, then passive strategies will be efficient. These call for diversified portfolios formed without incurring the research and trading expenses associated with an active approach. In particular, passive strategies focus on index portfolios that mimic the broad market portfolio, thus achieving the broadest diversification with extremely low implementation cost. For this reason, we sometimes call this result a mutual fund theorem. The mutual fund theorem is another incarnation of the separation property discussed in Chapter 7. If all investors would freely choose to hold the market portfolio, they would not object if all stocks were replaced with shares of a single mutual fund holding that market portfolio.

In reality, different investment managers do create risky portfolios that differ from the market index. We attribute this largely to the use of different input lists in the formation of their optimal risky portfolios. Nevertheless, the practical significance of the mutual fund theorem is that a passive investor, one who does not engage in security analysis, may view the market index as a reasonable first approximation to an efficient risky portfolio.

The nearby box summarizes some of the arguments for indexing. If the passive strategy is efficient, then attempts to beat it simply generate trading and research costs with no offsetting benefit and, ultimately, inferior results.

# Concept Check 9.1

If there are only a few investors who perform security analysis, and all others hold the market portfolio,  $M$ , would the CML still be the efficient CAL for investors who do not engage in security analysis? Why or why not?

# The Risk Premium of the Market Portfolio

In Chapter 6 we discussed how individual investors go about deciding capital allocation. If all investors choose to invest in portfolio  $M$  and the risk-free asset, what can we deduce about the equilibrium risk premium of portfolio  $M$ ?

Recall that each individual investor chooses a proportion  $y$ , allocated to the optimal portfolio  $M$ , such that

$$ y = \frac {E \left(r _ {M}\right) - r _ {f}}{A \sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} \tag {9.1}
$$ where  $E(r_{M}) - r_{f} = E(R_{M})$  is the market risk premium (expected excess return).


In the simplified CAPM economy, risk-free investments involve borrowing and lending among investors. Any borrowing position must be offset by the lending position of the creditor. This means that net borrowing and lending across all investors must be zero,

Index funds have long been considered one of the smartest investments you can make. They're affordable and well diversified, and they tend to generate solid returns over time, outperforming most actively managed funds. In 2007, Warren Buffett made a 1 million bet that an S&P 500 index fund would beat the returns of an actively managed hedge fund over 10 years—and he won in a landslide.

Buffett's victorious bet may be reason enough for some to start adding index funds to their portfolio, but if you need more convincing, read on to understand what index funds are and what makes them so popular.

Index funds are mutual funds—bundles of other investments, like stocks and bonds—that track the performance of a market index, like the S&P 500. Some indexes are tailored to specific sectors, geography, and stock exchanges. The funds that track these indexes contain the same investments in approximately the same proportion as the index itself.

There are three key benefits to investing in index funds: broad diversification, low costs, and solid returns.

1. Broad diversification The most obvious benefit of investing in index funds is that your portfolio becomes instantly diversified. For instance, an index fund that tracks the S&P 500 has 500 different investments. When your money is spread out among so many assets, your ups and downs will be smaller.
2. Low costs An expense ratio is an annual fee that mutual funds charge their shareholders, usually a percentage of invested assets. Actively managed mutual funds often have expense ratios above  $1\%$  because portfolio managers spend resources picking investments. So if you invest \$100,000, your expenses can be more than \$ 1,000 annually.

Index funds, on the other hand, are passively managed. Because they track a specified index, there's little work for portfolio managers to charge for, and these savings are passed on in the form of lower expense ratios. Many charge less than  $0.07\%$  of assets. If you invest \$100,000 in a mutual fund with a 0.07\%$  expense ratio, you will pay only \70 per year, versus \$1,000 with a  $1\%$  expense ratio. Not small potatoes.

Naturally, index funds have a lower turnover ratio than actively managed funds. Turnover ratios measure the percentage of a mutual fund's holdings that are replaced in a single year. If those assets are worth more when they're sold than when you bought them, the difference between the two prices is considered a capital gain and you'll have to pay taxes on this amount. This isn't as much of a concern with index funds, thanks to their low turnover, about  $1\%$  to  $2\%$  per year, compared with  $20\%$  or higher for some actively managed funds.

3. Solid returns As Buffett knew when he made his 1 million bet, even the smartest and most diligent portfolio managers don't consistently beat index funds. Only 23.51\% of actively managed mutual funds outperformed the S&P 500 over five years, according to the latest data from Standard & Poor's.

Whether you're new to investing or not, an index fund is a great asset to add to your portfolio. It takes a little time to find the right index fund for you, but once you do, you can sit back and let your money grow.

and, therefore, the average position in the risky portfolio is  $100\%$ , or  $\overline{y} = 1$ . Setting  $y = 1$  in Equation 9.1; substituting the representative investor's risk aversion,  $\overline{A}$ , for  $A$ ; and rearranging, we find that the risk premium on the market portfolio is related to its variance by the average degree of risk aversion:

$$
E \left(R _ {M}\right) = \bar {A} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} \tag {9.2}
$$

When investors purchase stocks, their demand drives up prices, thereby reducing expected rates of return and risk premiums. But when risk premiums fall, investors will shift some of their funds from the risky market portfolio into the risk-free asset. In equilibrium, the risk premium on the market portfolio must be just high enough to induce investors to hold the available supply of stocks. If the risk premium is too high, there will be excess demand for securities, and prices will rise; if it is too low, investors will not hold enough stock to absorb the supply, and prices will fall. Equation 9.2 tells us that the equilibrium risk premium of the market portfolio is therefore proportional both to the risk of the market, as measured by the variance of its returns, and to the degree of risk aversion of the average investor, denoted by  $\overline{A}$ .

# Concept Check 9.2

Data from the last 95 years for the broad U.S. equity market yield the following statistics: average excess return,  $8.9\%$ ; standard deviation,  $20.3\%$ .

a. To the extent that these averages approximated investor expectations for the period, what must have been the average coefficient of risk aversion?
b. If the coefficient of risk aversion were actually 3.5, what risk premium would have been consistent with the market's historical standard deviation?

# Expected Returns on Individual Securities

The CAPM is built on the insight that the appropriate risk premium on an asset will be determined by its contribution to the risk of investors' overall portfolios. Portfolio risk is what matters to investors and is what governs the risk premiums they demand.

Remember that in the CAPM, all investors use the same input list, that is, the same estimates of expected returns, variances, and covariances, and, therefore, all end up using the market as their optimal risky portfolio. To calculate the variance of the market portfolio, we use the bordered covariance matrix with the market portfolio weights, as discussed in Chapter 7. We highlight GE in this depiction of the  $n$  stocks in the market portfolio so that we can measure the contribution of GE to the risk of the market portfolio.

Recall that we calculate the variance of the portfolio by summing over all the elements of the covariance matrix, first multiplying each element by the portfolio weights from the row and the column. The contribution of one stock to portfolio variance therefore can be expressed as the sum of all the covariance terms in the column corresponding to the stock, where each covariance is first multiplied by both the stock's weight from its row and the weight from its column.

<table><tr><td>Portfolio Weights</td><td>w1</td><td>w2</td><td>...</td><td>wGE</td><td>...</td><td>wn</td></tr><tr><td>w1</td><td>Cov(R1, R1)</td><td>Cov(R1, R2)</td><td>...</td><td>Cov(R1, RGE)</td><td>...</td><td>Cov(R1, Rn)</td></tr><tr><td>w2</td><td>Cov(R2, R1)</td><td>Cov(R2, R2)</td><td>...</td><td>Cov(R2, RGE)</td><td>...</td><td>Cov(R2, Rn)</td></tr><tr><td>:</td><td>:</td><td>:</td><td></td><td>:</td><td></td><td>:</td></tr><tr><td>wGE</td><td>Cov(RGE, R1)</td><td>Cov(RGE, R2)</td><td>...</td><td>Cov(RGE, RGE)</td><td>...</td><td>Cov(RGE, Rn)</td></tr><tr><td>:</td><td>:</td><td>:</td><td></td><td>:</td><td></td><td>:</td></tr><tr><td>wn</td><td>Cov(Rn, R1)</td><td>Cov(Rn, R2)</td><td>...</td><td>Cov(Rn, RGE)</td><td>...</td><td>Cov(Rn, Rn)</td></tr></table>

Thus, the contribution of GE's stock to the variance of the market portfolio is

$$
\begin{array}{l} w _ {\mathrm {G E}} \left[ w _ {1} \operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {1}, R _ {\mathrm {G E}}\right) + w _ {2} \operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {2}, R _ {\mathrm {G E}}\right) + \dots + w _ {\mathrm {G E}} \operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {\mathrm {G E}}, R _ {\mathrm {G E}}\right) + \dots \right. \tag {9.3} \\ + w _ {n} \operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {n}, R _ {\mathrm {G E}}\right) ] \\ \end{array}
$$

An alternative approach would be to measure GE's contribution to market variance as the sum of the elements in the row and the column corresponding to GE. In this case, GE's contribution would be twice the sum in Equation 9.3. The approach that we take allocates contributions to portfolio risk among securities in a convenient manner in that the sum of the contributions of each stock equals the total portfolio variance, whereas the alternative measure of contribution would sum to twice the portfolio variance. This results from a type of double-counting because adding both the rows and the columns for each stock would result in each entry in the matrix being added twice. Using either approach, GE's contribution to the variance of the market return would be directly proportional to the covariance of its returns with the market.

Notice that every term in the square brackets can be slightly rearranged as follows:  $w_{i}\mathrm{Cov}(R_{i},R_{\mathrm{GE}}) = \mathrm{Cov}(w_{i}R_{i},R_{\mathrm{GE}})$ . Moreover, because covariance is additive, the sum of the terms in the square brackets is

$$
\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} w _ {i} \operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {i}, R _ {\mathrm {G E}}\right) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \operatorname {C o v} \left(w _ {i} R _ {i}, R _ {\mathrm {G E}}\right) = \operatorname {C o v} \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} w _ {i} R _ {i}, R _ {\mathrm {G E}}\right) \tag {9.4}
$$

But because  $\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i R_i = R_M$ , Equation 9.4 implies that

$$
\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} w _ {i} \mathrm {C o v} (R _ {i}, R _ {\mathrm {G E}}) = \mathrm {C o v} (R _ {M}, R _ {\mathrm {G E}})
$$ and, therefore, GE's contribution to the variance of the market portfolio (Equation 9.3) may be more simply stated as  $w_{\mathrm{GE}} \mathrm{Cov}(R_M, R_{\mathrm{GE}})$ .


This should not surprise us. For example, if the covariance between GE and the rest of the market is negative, then GE makes a "negative contribution" to portfolio risk: By providing excess returns that move inversely with the rest of the market, GE stabilizes the return on the overall portfolio. If the covariance is positive, GE makes a positive contribution to overall portfolio risk because its returns reinforce swings in the rest of the portfolio.

We also observe that the contribution of GE to the risk premium of the market portfolio is  $w_{\mathrm{GE}} E(R_{\mathrm{GE}})$ . Therefore, the reward-to-risk ratio for investments in GE can be expressed as

$$
\frac {\text {G E ' s c o n t r i b u t i o n t o r i s k p r e m i u m}}{\text {G E ' s c o n t r i b u t i o n t o v a r i a n c e}} = \frac {w _ {\mathrm {G E}} E \left(R _ {\mathrm {G E}}\right)}{w _ {\mathrm {G E}} \operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {\mathrm {G E}} , R _ {M}\right)} = \frac {E \left(R _ {\mathrm {G E}}\right)}{\operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {\mathrm {G E}} , R _ {M}\right)}
$$

The market portfolio is the tangency (efficient mean-variance) portfolio. The reward-to-risk ratio for investment in the market portfolio is

$$
\frac {\text {M a r k e t} R _ {M})}{\text {M a r k e t} \text {v a r i a n c e}} = \frac {E (R _ {M})}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} \tag {9.5}
$$

The ratio in Equation 9.5 is often called the market price of risk because it quantifies the extra return that investors demand to bear portfolio risk. Notice that for components of the efficient portfolio, such as shares of GE, we measure risk as the contribution to portfolio variance (which depends on its covariance with the market). In contrast, for the efficient portfolio itself, variance is the appropriate measure of risk.

A basic principle of equilibrium is that all investments should offer the same reward-to-risk ratio. If the ratio were better for one investment than another, investors would rearrange their portfolios, tilting toward the alternative with the better trade-off and shying away from the other. Such activity would impart pressure on security prices until the ratios

A positive contribution to variance doesn't imply that diversification isn't beneficial. Excluding GE from the portfolio would require that its weight be assigned to the remaining stocks and that reallocation would increase variance even more. Variance is reduced by including more stocks and reducing the weight of each (i.e., diversifying), despite the fact that each positive-covariance security makes some contribution to variance. Notice in Equation 9.1 that the optimal allocation to the risky portfolio is proportional to the ratio of the risk premium to variance, not to standard deviation.

7Unfortunately, the market portfolio's Sharpe ratio

$$
\frac {E (r _ {M}) - r _ {f}}{\sigma_ {M}}
$$ sometimes is referred to as the market price of risk, but this is not correct. The price of risk relates risk premium to variance (or to covariance for incremental risk), not standard deviation.


were equalized. Therefore, we conclude that the reward-to-risk ratios of GE and the market portfolio should be equal:

$$
\frac {E \left(R _ {\mathrm {G E}}\right)}{\operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {\mathrm {G E}} , R _ {M}\right)} = \frac {E \left(R _ {M}\right)}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} \tag {9.6}
$$

To determine the fair risk premium of GE stock, we rearrange Equation 9.6 slightly to obtain

$$
E \left(R _ {\mathrm {G E}}\right) = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {\mathrm {G E}} , R _ {M}\right)}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} E \left(R _ {M}\right) \tag {9.7}
$$

The ratio  $\mathrm{Cov}(R_{\mathrm{GE}}, R_M) / \sigma_M^2$  measures the contribution of GE stock to the variance of the market portfolio as a fraction of the total variance of the market portfolio. The ratio is called beta and is denoted by  $\beta$ . Using this measure, we can restate Equation 9.7 as

$$
E \left(r _ {\mathrm {G E}}\right) = r _ {f} + \beta_ {\mathrm {G E}} \left[ E \left(r _ {M}\right) - r _ {f} \right] \tag {9.8}
$$

This expected return-beta (or mean-beta) relationship is the most familiar expression of the CAPM to practitioners.

The expected return-beta relationship tells us that the total expected rate of return is the sum of the risk-free rate (compensation for "waiting," i.e., the time value of money) plus a risk premium (compensation for "worrying," specifically about investment returns). Moreover, it makes a very specific prediction about the size of the risk premium: It is the product of a "benchmark risk premium" (that of the broad market portfolio) and the relative risk of the particular asset as measured by its beta (its contribution to the risk of the overall risky portfolio).

Notice what the risk premium does not depend on: the total volatility of the investment. So, for example, the stock market performance of a firm developing a new drug that may be a great success or a total failure may have extremely high variance, but investors in those shares will not, for that reason, demand a high expected return. They recognize that because the success of the firm is largely independent of macroeconomic risk and the return on the rest of their (diversified) portfolio, its contribution to overall portfolio risk is low and therefore does not warrant a large risk premium. The CAPM predicts that systematic risk should "be priced," meaning that it commands a risk premium, but firm-specific risk should not be priced by the market.

If the expected return-beta relationship holds for each individual asset, it must hold for any combination or weighted average of assets. Suppose that some portfolio  $P$  has weight  $w_{k}$  for stock  $k$ , where  $k$  takes on values 1, ..., n. Writing out the CAPM Equation 9.8 for each stock, and multiplying each equation by the weight of the stock in the portfolio, we obtain these equations, one for each stock:

$$
\begin{array}{l} w _ {1} E (r _ {1}) = w _ {1} r _ {f} + w _ {1} \beta_ {1} [ E (r _ {M}) - r _ {f} ] \\ + w _ {2} E (r _ {2}) = w _ {2} r _ {f} + w _ {2} \beta_ {2} [ E (r _ {M}) - r _ {f} ] \\ + \quad \dots = \dots \\ + w _ {n} E (r _ {n}) = w _ {n} r _ {f} + w _ {n} \beta_ {n} [ E (r _ {M}) - r _ {f} ] \\ E (r _ {P}) = r _ {f} + \beta_ {P} [ E (r _ {M}) - r _ {f} ] \\ \end{array}
$$

Summing each column shows that the CAPM holds for the overall portfolio because  $E(r_{P}) = \sum_{k} w_{k} E(r_{k})$  is the expected return on the portfolio and  $\beta_{P} = \sum_{k} w_{k} \beta_{k}$  is the portfolio beta. Incidentally, this result has to be true for the market portfolio itself,

$$
E (r _ {M}) = r _ {f} + \beta_ {M} [ E (r _ {M}) - r _ {f} ]
$$

Indeed, this is a tautology because  $\beta_{M} = 1$ , as we can verify by noting that

$$
\beta_ {M} = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {M} , R _ {M}\right)}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} = \frac {\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} = 1 \tag {9.9}
$$

This also establishes 1 as the weighted-average value of beta across all assets. If the market beta is 1, and the market is a portfolio of all assets in the economy, the weighted-average beta of all assets must be 1. Hence, betas greater than 1 are considered aggressive in that investment in high-beta stocks entails above-average sensitivity to market swings. Betas below 1 can be described as defensive.

A word of caution: We often hear that well-managed firms will provide high rates of return. We agree this is true if one measures the firm's return on its investments in plant and equipment. The CAPM, however, predicts returns on investments in the securities of the firm.

Let's say that everyone knows a firm is well run. Its stock price will therefore be bid up, and consequently returns to stockholders who buy at those high prices will not be excessive. Security prices, in other words, already reflect public information about a firm's prospects; therefore, only the risk of the company (as measured by beta in the context of the CAPM) should affect expected returns. In a well-functioning market, investors receive high expected returns only if they are willing to bear risk.

Of course, investors do not directly observe expected returns on securities. Rather, they observe security prices and bid those prices up or down. Expected rates of return can at most be inferred from the prices investors pay compared to the cash flows those investments are expected to generate.

# Concept Check 9.3

Suppose that the risk premium on the market portfolio is estimated at  $8\%$  with a standard deviation of  $22\%$ . What is the risk premium on a portfolio invested  $25\%$  in Toyota and  $75\%$  in Ford if they have betas of 1.10 and 1.25, respectively?

# The Security Market Line

The expected return-beta relationship is a reward-risk equation. The beta of a security is the appropriate measure of its risk because beta is proportional to the risk the security contributes to the optimal risky portfolio.

Risk-averse mean-variance investors measure the risk of the optimal risky portfolio by its variance. Hence, we would expect the risk premium on an individual asset to depend on its contribution to the risk of the portfolio. The beta of a stock measures its contribution to the variance of the market portfolio, and, therefore, the required risk premium is a function of beta. The CAPM confirms this intuition, stating further that the security's risk premium is directly proportional to both the beta and the risk premium of the market portfolio; that is, the risk premium equals  $\beta [E(r_M) - r_f]$ .

The expected return-beta relationship can be portrayed graphically as the security market line (SML) in Figure 9.2. Because the market's beta is 1, the slope is the risk premium of the market portfolio. At the point on the horizontal axis where  $\beta = 1$ , we can read off the vertical axis the expected return on the market portfolio.

It is useful to compare the security market line to the capital market line. The CML graphs the risk premiums of efficient portfolios (i.e., portfolios composed of the market and the risk-free asset) as a function of portfolio standard deviation. This is appropriate because standard deviation is a valid measure of risk for efficiently diversified portfolios that are candidates for an investor's overall portfolio. The SML, in contrast, graphs individual asset risk premiums as a function of asset risk. The relevant measure of risk for individual assets held as parts of well-diversified portfolios is not the asset's standard deviation or variance; it is, instead, the contribution of the asset to the portfolio variance, which we measure by the asset's beta. The SML is valid for both efficient portfolios and individual assets.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/3a880d56e4b67b015b955b1a102a48540740680017e6f1a46b7c1b39e5f0eedf.jpg)
Figure 9.2 The security market line


The security market line offers a benchmark for the evaluation of investment performance. It provides the expected rate of return investors demand as compensation for both beta risk as well as the time value of money.[8] Because the security market line is the graphic representation of the expected return-beta relationship, "fairly priced" assets plot exactly on the SML; that is, their expected returns are commensurate with their risk. All securities lie on the SML in market equilibrium.

We see here how the CAPM may be of use in the money-management industry. Suppose that security analysis is performed to calculate the return a money manager actually expects. (Notice that we depart here from the simple CAPM world in that some investors now apply their own unique analysis to derive an "input list" that may differ from that of their competitors.) If a stock is perceived to be a good buy, or underpriced, it will provide an expected return in excess of the equilibrium return stipulated by the SML. Underpriced stocks therefore plot above the SML: Given their betas, their expected returns are greater than dictated by the CAPM. Overpriced stocks plot below the SML.


The difference between the equilibrium and actually expected rate of return on a stock is called the stock's alpha, denoted by  $\alpha$ . For example, if the market return is expected to be  $14\%$ , a stock has a beta of 1.2, and the T-bill rate is  $6\%$ , the SML would predict an expected return on the stock of  $6 + 1.2(14 - 6) = 15.6\%$ . If one believed the stock would provide an expected return of  $17\%$ , the implied alpha would be  $1.4\%$  (see Figure 9.3).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/80c1a0d952c328703dd43aba813c9b5e35bbc9f0a24d46dbf92b91c22e76e5b3.jpg)

# Concept Check 9.4

Stock XYZ has an expected return of  $12\%$  and risk of  $\beta = 1$ . Stock ABC has expected return of  $13\%$  and  $\beta = 1.5$ . The market's expected return is  $11\%$ , and  $r_f = 5\%$ .

a. According to the CAPM, which stock is a better buy?
b. What is the alpha of each stock? Plot the SML and each stock's risk-return point on one graph. Show the alphas graphically.

One might say that security analysis (which we treat in Part Five) is about uncovering securities with nonzero alphas. This analysis suggests that the starting point of portfolio management can be a passive market-index portfolio. The portfolio manager will then increase the weights of securities with positive alphas and decrease the weights of securities with negative alphas. We showed one strategy (the Treynor-Black model) for adjusting the portfolio weights in such a manner in Chapter 8.

The CAPM is also useful in capital budgeting decisions. For a firm considering a new project, the CAPM can provide the required rate of return that the project needs to yield, based on its beta, to be acceptable to investors. Managers can use the CAPM to obtain this cutoff internal rate of return (IRR), or "hurdle rate," for the project.

Figure 9.3 The SML and a positive-alpha stock. The risk-free rate is  $6\%$ , and the market's expected return is  $14\%$ , implying a market risk premium of  $8\%$ .

# Example 9.1 The CAPM and Capital Budgeting

An expansion of a firm's production facilities will cost  \$100 million and is expected to generate incremental cash flows of\$ 20 million a year for 8 years. What is the project's NPV? If the project beta is .8, the market risk premium is 8\%, and the risk-free rate is 2\%, then the discount rate for the project is  $2 + .8 \times 8 = 8.4\%$ . The project's net present value is therefore:

$$
\begin{array}{l} N P V = -100 + 20 \times \text {Annuity Factor} (8.4\%, 8 \text {years}) \\ = - 1 0 0 + 2 0 \times 5. 6 6 0 = \$ 1 3. 2 1 \text {m i l l i o n} \\ \end{array}
$$

Yet another use of the CAPM is in utility rate cases. The question in those cases is what rate of return a regulated utility should be allowed to earn on its investment in plant and equipment. The next example illustrates.

# Example 9.2 Using the CAPM for Regulated Utilities

Suppose that the equityholders of a regulated utility have invested 100 million in the firm and that the beta of the equity is .6. If the T-bill rate is 6 \% and the market risk premium is 8 \%, then the fair expected profits to the firm would be assessed as 6 + .6 \times 8 = 10.8 \% of the \$ 100 million investment, or \$ 10.8 million. The firm would be allowed to set prices at a level expected to generate these profits.

# Concept Check 9.5

The risk-free rate is  $8\%$  and the expected return on the market portfolio is  $16\%$ . A firm considers a project that is expected to have a beta of 1.3.

a. What is the required rate of return on the project?
b. If the expected IRR of the project is  $19\%$ , should it be accepted?

# The CAPM and the Single-Index Market

The index model from the last chapter asserted that security returns could be described by Equation 8.8, which is restated here as Equation 9.10:

$$
R _ {i} = \alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {M} + e _ {i} \tag {9.10}
$$

The index model states that the realized excess return on any stock is the sum of the realized excess return due to marketwide factors,  $\beta_{i}R_{M}$ , a nonmarket premium,  $\alpha_{i}$ , and firm-specific outcomes summarized by  $e_i$ . Because the expected value of firm-specific surprises is zero, the expected excess return, equivalently the risk premium, of stock  $i$  would then be given by Equation 9.11:

$$
E \left(R _ {i}\right) = \alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {i} E \left(R _ {M}\right) \tag {9.11}
$$

The expected return-beta relationship of the CAPM, which we rearrange very slightly from Equation 9.8, is  $E(r_{i}) - r_{f} = \beta_{i}[E(r_{M}) - r_{f}]$ . Stated in terms of excess returns, this risk-return relation is:

$$
E \left(R _ {i}\right) = \beta_ {i} E \left(R _ {M}\right) \tag {9.12}
$$

Comparing Equations 9.11 and 9.12, we see that the prediction of the CAPM is that for every stock, the equilibrium value of  $\alpha_{i}$  is 0. The logic of the CAPM is that the only reason for a stock to provide a premium over the risk-free rate is that the stock imposes systematic risk for which the investor must be compensated. A positive alpha implies reward without risk. Investors will relentlessly pursue positive alpha stocks and bid up their prices; at those higher prices, expected rates of return will be lower. Symmetrically, investors will shun or short sell negative alpha stocks, driving down their prices and driving up their expected returns. This portfolio rebalancing will continue until all alpha values are driven to zero. At this point, investors will be content to fully diversify and eliminate unique risk, that is, to hold the broadest possible market portfolio. When all stocks have zero alphas, the market portfolio is the optimal risky portfolio.

Of course, if you estimate the index model regression (Equation 9.10), you will find that in any particular sample period, some firms will do better than investors initially expected and therefore display positive alphas; others will disappoint and provide negative alphas. But if the CAPM is correct, estimated values of alpha for any group of stocks should cluster around zero. We will turn to some of the empirical evidence on this prediction in Chapter 11.

# 9.2 Assumptions and Extensions of the CAPM

From the outset, we noted that the CAPM is an elegant model built on a set of uncomfortably restrictive assumptions. This raises the question of what happens to the predicted risk-return relationship when we attempt to generalize the model to accommodate more realistic assumptions. In this section, we will review some variants of the basic model. We organize the discussion by the particular assumption from Table 9.1 that is called into question. We will discover that parts of the model change in important ways, but the fundamental distinction between systematic and diversifiable risk remains.

# Identical Input Lists

Assumption 1(c) (investors optimize with the same input list) appears ominously restrictive, but it actually is not all that problematic. When most information is public, it would not be surprising for investors to be close to agreement on firms' prospects. Moreover, trades of investors who derive different input lists will offset and prices will reflect consensus expectations. We will later allow for the possibility that some investors expend resources to obtain private information and exploit prices that don't reflect the insights derived from this information. But regardless of their success, it is reasonable to conclude that, at least in the absence of private information, investors should assume alpha values are zero.

On the other hand, impediments to selling securities short (which we ruled out in Assumption 2[b]) can upend this conclusion. We start with the fact that short positions are not as easy to take as long ones for three reasons:

1. The liability of investors who hold a short position in an asset is potentially unlimited because the price may rise without limit. Hence, a large short position requires large collateral, and proceeds cannot be used to invest in other risky assets.
2. There is a limited supply of shares of any stock to be borrowed by would-be short sellers. It often happens that investors simply cannot find shares to borrow in order to short.
3. Many investment companies are prohibited from short sales. The U.S. and other countries further restrict short sales by regulation.

Why are short sales important? When prices rise above intrinsic values, rational investors will take short positions, thus holding down the price. But given impediments to short sales, the natural market actions that would normally prevent prices from rising to unsustainable levels are likewise impeded. Such price run-ups are precursors to a correction or even a crash and are a good part of what defines a "bubble."

Taxes also cast doubt on Assumption 1(c) because two investors can realize different after-tax returns from the same stock. Such distortions to the "input list" could, in principle, lead to different after-tax optimal risky portfolios; hence, the CAPM required Assumption 2(c) (no taxes). Nevertheless, despite an extension to the CAPM that incorporates personal taxes on dividends and capital gains,[10] there is no decisive evidence that taxes are a major factor in stock returns. A plausible explanation for this negative finding relies on "clientele" and supply effects. If high tax-bracket investors shy away from high-yield (dividend-paying) stocks and thus force down their prices, tax-exempt investors will view the stocks as a bargain and take up the slack in demand. On the other end, if corporations see that high dividend yields reduce stock prices, they simply will substitute stock repurchases for dividends, reinforcing the clientele effect in neutralizing tax effects.

# Risk-Free Borrowing and the Zero-Beta Model

Restrictions on borrowing (or significantly higher rates on borrowing than on lending), which violate Assumption 2(b), also can create problems for the CAPM because borrowers and lenders will arrive at different tangency portfolios and thus different optimal risky portfolios. The market portfolio will no longer be each investor's optimal risky portfolio.

Efficient frontier portfolios have a number of interesting characteristics, independently derived by Merton and Roll. Some of these are:

1. Any portfolio that is a combination of two frontier portfolios is itself on the efficient frontier.
2. Because each investor will still choose his or her optimal risky portfolio from the efficient frontier, the market portfolio will be an aggregation of efficient portfolios and therefore (from the first property) will itself be efficient.
3. Every portfolio on the efficient frontier, except for the global minimum-variance portfolio, has a "companion" portfolio on the bottom (inefficient) half of the frontier with which it is uncorrelated. Because it is uncorrelated, the companion portfolio is referred to as the zero-beta portfolio of the efficient portfolio. Focusing on the market portfolio  $M$  and its zero-beta companion portfolio  $Z$ , one can derive the following CAPM-like equation:

$$
E \left(r _ {i}\right) - E \left(r _ {Z}\right) = \left[ E \left(r _ {M}\right) - E \left(r _ {Z}\right) \right] \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {i} , r _ {M}\right)}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} = \beta_ {i} \left[ E \left(r _ {M}\right) - E \left(r _ {Z}\right) \right] \tag {9.13}
$$

Equation 9.13 resembles the SML of the CAPM, except that the risk-free rate is replaced with the expected return on the zero-beta companion of the market-index portfolio. Fischer Black used these properties to show that Equation 9.13 is the CAPM equation that results when investors face restrictions on borrowing. $^{12}$

Risk-tolerant investors are the ones who would like to borrow to leverage up their position in the tangency portfolio. But limits to their ability to borrow or spreads between borrowing and lending rates impede their ability to do so. Investors who would otherwise wish to borrow and leverage the tangency portfolio but who find it impossible or costly to do so will instead tilt their portfolios toward high-beta (high expected return) stocks and away from low-beta ones. As a result, prices of high-beta stocks will rise, and their risk premiums will fall. In Equation 9.13, the risk premium on the market portfolio is smaller than predicted by the basic CAPM because the expected return on the zero-beta portfolio is greater than the risk-free rate, and therefore the reward to bearing systematic risk is smaller. In other words, the SML will be flatter than in the simple CAPM.

# Labor Income and Other Nontraded Assets

The assertion that all assets are tradable (Assumption 2[a]) is essential for the conclusion that the market portfolio, which is so central to the CAPM, is the common risky portfolio chosen by all investors. In fact, many assets are not tradeable. Private businesses are a large and important part of the economy, but by definition, these businesses do not trade. Neither does human capital, the earning power of individuals. As a rough guide to relative magnitudes, we note that employee compensation averaged just about  $60\%$  of national

Merton, "An Analytic Derivation of the Efficient Portfolio Frontier," Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 1972; and Richard Roll, "A Critique of the Asset Pricing Theory's Tests: Part I: On Past and Potential Testability of the Theory," Journal of Financial Economics 4 (1977).

income for the five years ending in 2021. It seems clear that human capital is considerably higher than the total market value of traded assets. The market value of privately held corporations and businesses is of the same order of magnitude.

These considerations imply that investors may derive very different "optimal risky portfolios." Consider owners of a family business. Their wealth is already highly dependent on the success of the business. Prudence dictates that they avoid further investments in assets that are highly correlated with their business. Similarly, investors should avoid stock returns that are positively correlated with their personal income; for example, Delta employees should avoid investing in the airline and related businesses. Differential investment demands arising from this consideration can derail the mean-variance efficiency of the index portfolio.

To the extent that risk characteristics of private enterprises differ from those of traded securities, a portfolio of traded assets that best hedges the risk of typical private business would enjoy elevated demand from the population of private business owners. The price of assets in this portfolio will be bid up relative to the CAPM prediction, and the expected returns on these securities will be lower in relation to their systematic risk. In fact, Heaton and Lucas show that adding proprietary income to a standard asset-pricing model improves its predictive performance.[13]

The size of labor income and its special nature are of even greater concern for the validity of the CAPM. The possible effect of labor income on equilibrium returns can be appreciated from its important effect on personal portfolio choice. Human capital is less "portable" across time and may be more difficult to hedge using traded securities than nontraded business. This may induce hedging demand for stocks of labor-intensive firms with high wage expenses: These firms will do well when wage income is generally depressed, and thus serve as a hedge against wage income uncertainty. The resulting pressure on security prices may reduce the equilibrium expected return on these stocks to levels below those predicted by the CAPM.

Mayers derives the equilibrium expected return-beta equation for an economy in which individuals are endowed with labor income of varying size relative to their nonlabor capital. He finds that the mean-beta relation of the simple CAPM must be modified in a few key ways; for example, including human capital along with financial wealth in the market portfolio, which also requires accounting for the covariance of asset returns with the "portfolio" of aggregate human capital.

Other implications of labor income relate to the distribution of risk sharing across the economy. For example, young investors typically have a lot of human capital (they have many working years left in life) but little financial capital. Unless they can borrow to invest, they cannot buy a lot of equity. Therefore, middle-age or older investors have to bear most of the economy's financial risk; this concentration of financial risk on a subset of the population can result in a higher market risk premium than one would otherwise infer from Equation 9.2.[15]

# A Multiperiod Model and Hedge Portfolios

Assumption 1(a) states that only the mean and variance of wealth matter to investors. But consider these questions:

1. Would you rather have wealth of \$1.1 million and a price of oil of \$400 per barrel or \$1 million and oil priced at \$40 per barrel? If you are a big energy consumer, you may very well be better off with slightly less money and considerably lower energy prices. The lower energy-price scenario leaves you with more to spend on other consumption goods.
2. Would you rather have wealth of  \$1 million and a real interest rate of 10\%$  or 1.1 million and a real rate of  $1\%$ ? You may be better off with slightly less money but with the ability to invest it to earn higher returns. Your stream of consumption could easily be higher in the lower wealth—higher rate scenario.
 3. Would you rather have wealth of \$1 million with a market standard deviation of 10\% or \$1.1 million and a standard derivation of 50\%? You may be better off with slightly less money but with the lower volatility. You would then be more comfortable investing a greater share of your wealth in the market index, thereby earning a higher risk premium on your complete portfolio.

These examples show that investors should care about more than the risk and return of their wealth as measured in dollars. They should be more concerned with the stream of consumption that wealth can buy for them. Therefore, Assumption 1(a), that investors optimize over the mean and variance of the dollar value of their portfolios, is problematic. The assumption rules out concern with the correlation of asset returns with either inflation or prices of important consumption items such as housing or energy. It also rules out concern with the correlation between asset returns and the parameters of the "investment opportunity set," for example, changes in the volatility of asset returns. The extra demand for assets that can be used to hedge these "extra-market risks" would increase their prices and reduce their risk premiums relative to the prediction of the CAPM.

Similar extra-market risk factors would arise in a multiperiod model, which we ignored when we adopted Assumption 1(b), limiting investors to a common single-period horizon. Consider a possible decline in future interest rates. Investors would be unhappy about this event to the extent that it would reduce the expected income their investments could throw off in the future. Assets whose returns will be higher when interest rates fall (e.g., long-term bonds) would hedge this risk and thus command higher prices and lower risk premiums. Because of such hedging demands, correlation with any parameter describing future investment opportunities can result in violations of the CAPM mean-beta equation.

Robert C. Merton devised a model of asset pricing that allows us to examine the impacts of these hedging demands.[16] In his basic model, Merton relaxes the "single-period" assumption about investors. He envisions individuals who optimize a lifetime consumption/investment plan and who continually adapt their consumption/investment decisions to changes in wealth, prices, and investment opportunities. In one special case, when uncertainty about portfolio returns is the only source of risk and investment opportunities remain unchanged through time (i.e., there is no change in the risk-free rate or the probability distribution of the return on the market portfolio or individual securities), Merton's so-called intertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM) predicts the same expected return-beta relationship as the simple CAPM.[17]

But the situation changes when we include additional sources of risk. These extra risks are of two general kinds. One concerns changes in the parameters describing investment opportunities, such as future risk-free rates, expected returns, or asset risk. Suppose that the real interest rate may change over time. If it falls in some future period, one's level of wealth will now support a lower stream of real consumption. Future spending plans, for example, for retirement spending, may be put in jeopardy. To the extent that returns on some securities are correlated with changes in the risk-free rate, a portfolio can be formed to hedge such risk, and investors will bid up the price (and bid down the expected return) of those hedge assets. Investors will sacrifice some expected return if they can find assets whose returns will be higher when other parameters (in this case, the real risk-free rate) change adversely.

The other additional source of risk concerns the prices of the consumption goods that can be purchased with any amount of wealth. Consider inflation risk. In addition to the expected level and volatility of nominal wealth, investors must be concerned about the cost of living—what those dollars can buy. Therefore, inflation risk is an important extramarket source of risk, and investors may be willing to sacrifice some expected return to purchase securities whose returns will be higher when the cost of living changes adversely. If so, hedging demands for securities that help to protect against inflation risk would affect portfolio choice and thus expected return. One can push this conclusion even further, arguing that empirically significant hedging demands may arise for important subsectors of consumer expenditures; for example, investors may bid up share prices of energy companies that will hedge energy price uncertainty. These sorts of effects may characterize any assets that hedge important extra-market sources of risk.

More generally, suppose we can identify  $K$  sources of extra-market risk and find  $K$  associated hedge portfolios. Then, Merton's ICAPM expected return-beta equation would generalize the SML to a multi-index version:

$$
E \left(R _ {i}\right) = \beta_ {i M} E \left(R _ {M}\right) + \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {K} \beta_ {i k} E \left(R _ {k}\right) \tag {9.14}
$$ where  $\beta_{iM}$  is the familiar security beta on the market-index portfolio and  $\beta_{ik}$  is the beta on the  $k$ th hedge portfolio. The equation predicts that the risk premium for security  $i$  is the sum of the compensation it commands for all of the relevant risk sources to which it is exposed. The first term is the usual risk premium for exposure to market risk. The other terms (in the summation sign) are benchmark risk premiums for each source of extra-market risk times the security beta with respect to that risk source. Thus, this expression generalizes the one-factor SML to a world with multiple sources of systematic risk.


# A Consumption-Based CAPM

The logic of the CAPM together with the hedging demands noted in the previous subsection suggest that it might be useful to center the model directly on consumption. Such models were pioneered by Mark Rubinstein, Robert Lucas, and Douglas Breeden.[18]

In a lifetime consumption/investment plan, the investor must in each period balance the allocation of current wealth between today's consumption and the savings and investment that will support future consumption. When optimized, the utility value from an additional dollar of consumption today must equal the utility value of the expected future consumption that could be financed by investing that marginal dollar.


Suppose you wish to increase expected consumption growth by allocating some of your savings to a risky portfolio. How would we measure the risk of these assets? As a general rule, investors will value additional income more highly during difficult economic times (when resources are scarce) than in affluent times (when consumption is already abundant). An asset will therefore be viewed as riskier in terms of consumption if it has positive covariance with consumption growth—in other words, if its payoff is higher when consumption is already high but lower when consumption is relatively restricted. Therefore, equilibrium risk premiums will be greater for assets that exhibit higher covariance with consumption growth. Developing this insight, we can write the risk premium on an asset as a function of its "consumption risk" as follows:

$$
E \left(R _ {i}\right) = \beta_ {i C} \mathrm {R P} _ {C} \tag {9.15}
$$ where portfolio  $C$  may be interpreted as a consumption-tracking portfolio (also called a consumption-mimicking portfolio), that is, the portfolio with the highest correlation with consumption growth;  $\beta_{iC}$  is the slope coefficient in the regression of asset  $i$ 's excess returns,  $R_i$ , on those of the consumption-tracking portfolio; and, finally,  $\mathrm{RP}_C$  is the risk premium associated with consumption uncertainty, which is measured by the expected excess return on the consumption-tracking portfolio:


$$
\mathrm {R P} _ {C} = E \left(R _ {C}\right) = E \left(r _ {C}\right) - r _ {f} \tag {9.16}
$$

Notice how similar this conclusion is to the conventional CAPM. The consumption-tracking portfolio in the consumption-based CAPM (often called the CCAPM) plays the role of the market portfolio in the conventional CAPM. This is consistent with its focus on the risk of consumption opportunities rather than the risk and return of the dollar value of the portfolio. The excess return on the consumption-tracking portfolio plays the role of the excess return on the market portfolio,  $M$ . Both approaches result in linear, single-factor models that differ mainly in the identity of the factor they use.

Because the CCAPM is so similar to the CAPM, one might wonder about its usefulness. Indeed, just as the CAPM is empirically flawed because not all assets are traded, the CCAPM has its own shortcomings. The attractiveness of this model is in that it compactly incorporates hedging demands surrounding consumption uncertainty as well as possible changes in the parameters that characterize investment opportunities. There is a price to pay for this compactness, however. Consumption growth figures are measured with significant error and published infrequently (monthly at the most), compared with financial assets, whose prices are available throughout the day. Nevertheless, some empirical research indicates that this model is more successful in explaining realized returns than the CAPM, which is a reason why students of investments should be familiar with it. We return to this issue, as well as empirical evidence concerning the CCAPM, in Chapter 13.

# Liquidity and the CAPM

Finally, transaction costs inhibit trades; this violates Assumption 2(d) (no transaction costs). In fact, the CAPM has little to say about trading activity. In the equilibrium of the CAPM, all investors share all available information and demand identical portfolios of risky assets. The awkward implication of this result is that there is no reason for trade. If all investors hold identical portfolios of risky assets, then when new (unexpected) information arrives, prices will change commensurately, but each investor will continue to hold a piece of the market portfolio, which requires no exchange of assets. How do we square this implication with the observation that on a typical day, trading volume amounts to several billion shares? One obvious answer is heterogeneous expectations, that is, beliefs not shared by the entire market. Diverse beliefs will give rise to trading as investors attempt to profit by rearranging portfolios in accordance with their now-heterogeneous demands. In reality, trading (and trading costs) will be of great importance to investors.


The liquidity of an asset is the ease and speed with which it can be sold at fair market value. Part of liquidity is the cost of engaging in a transaction, particularly the bid-ask spread. Another part is price impact—the adverse movement in price one would encounter when attempting to execute a larger trade. Yet another component is immediacy—the ability to sell the asset quickly without reverting to fire-sale prices. Conversely, illiquidity can be measured in part by the discount from fair market value a seller must accept if the asset is to be sold quickly. A perfectly liquid asset is one that would entail no illiquidity discount.

Liquidity (or the lack of it) has long been recognized as an important characteristic that affects asset values. In legal cases, courts have routinely applied very steep discounts to the values of businesses that cannot be publicly traded. But liquidity has not always been appreciated as an important factor in security markets, presumably due to the relatively small trading cost per transaction compared with the large costs of trading assets such as real estate. The first breakthrough came in the work of Amihud and Mendelson $^{20}$  and today, liquidity is routinely viewed as an important determinant of prices and expected returns. We supply only a brief synopsis of this important topic here and provide empirical evidence in Chapter 13.

One important component of trading cost is the bid-ask spread. For example, in electronic markets, the limit-order book contains the "inside spread," that is, the difference between the highest price at which some investor will purchase any shares and the lowest price at which another investor is willing to sell. The effective bid-ask spread will also depend on the size of the desired transaction. Larger purchases will require a trader to move deeper into the limit-order book and accept less-attractive prices. While inside spreads on electronic markets often appear extremely low, effective spreads can be much larger because most limit orders are good for only small numbers of shares.

There is great emphasis today on the component of the spread due to asymmetric information. Asymmetric information is the potential for one trader to have private information about the value of the security that is not known to the trading partner. To see why such an asymmetry can affect the market, think about the problems facing someone buying a used car. The seller knows more about the car than the buyer, so the buyer naturally wonders if the seller is trying to get rid of the car because it is a "lemon." At the least, buyers worried about overpaying will shave the prices they are willing to pay for a car of uncertain quality. In extreme cases of asymmetric information, trading may cease altogether.[21] Similarly, traders who post offers to buy or sell at limit prices need to be worried about being picked off by better-informed traders who hit their limit prices only when they are out of line with the intrinsic value of the firm.


Broadly speaking, we may envision investors trading securities for two reasons. Some trades are driven by "noninformational" motives, for example, selling assets to raise cash for a big purchase, or even just for portfolio rebalancing. These sorts of trades, which are not motivated by private information that bears on the value of the traded security, are called noise trades. Market makers will earn a profit from the bid-ask spread when transacting with noise traders (also called liquidity traders because their trades may derive from needs for liquidity, i.e., cash).

Other transactions are initiated by traders who believe they have come across information that a security is mispriced. But if that information gives them an advantage, it must be disadvantageous to their trading counterparties. In this manner, information traders impose a cost on both security dealers and other investors who post limit orders. Although on average dealers make money from the bid-ask spread when transacting with liquidity traders, they absorb losses from information traders. Similarly, any trader posting a limit order is at risk from information traders. The response is to increase limit-ask prices and decrease limit-bid orders—in other words, the spread must widen. The greater the importance of information traders, the greater the spread required to compensate for the potential losses from trading with them. In the end, therefore, liquidity traders absorb most of the cost of the information trades because the bid-ask spread that they must pay on their "innocent" trades widens when informational asymmetry is more severe.

Moreover, security dealers will respond to a buy order by increasing asked prices, reasoning that if the order is informationally based, they should revise upward their estimate of the intrinsic value of the stock. Similarly, sell orders induce reductions in posted prices. These so-called price impacts affect any trade larger than the typically small sizes posted for the best bid or offer prices, and also represent increased trading costs for noise traders.

Higher trading costs make securities less attractive, in part because investors realize that they incur costs not just at the time of purchase, but also when they eventually will sell their shares. The prospect of these future trading costs depresses current share prices. Of course, if someone buys a share at a lower price, the expected rate of return will be higher. Therefore, we should expect to see less-liquid securities offer higher average rates of return. But this illiquidity premium need not rise in direct proportion to trading cost. If an asset is less liquid, it will be shunned by frequent traders and held instead by longer-term traders who are less affected by high trading costs. Hence, in equilibrium, investors with long holding periods will, on average, hold more of the illiquid securities, while short-horizon investors will prefer liquid securities. This "clientele effect" mitigates the effect of the bid-ask spread for illiquid securities. The end result is that the liquidity premium should increase with trading costs (measured by the bid-ask spread) at a decreasing rate.

Figure 9.4 confirms this prediction. It shows average monthly returns for stocks stratified by bid-ask spread. The difference in returns between the most liquid stocks (lowest bid-ask spread) and least liquid stocks (highest spread) is about  $.7\%$  per month. This is just about the same magnitude as the monthly market risk premium! Liquidity clearly matters for asset pricing.

So far, we have shown that the expected level of liquidity can affect prices, and therefore expected rates of return. What about unanticipated changes in liquidity? In some circumstances, liquidity can unexpectedly dry up. For example, in the financial crisis of 2008, as many investors attempted to reduce leverage and cash out their positions, finding buyers for some assets became difficult. Many mortgage-backed securities stopped trading altogether. Liquidity had evaporated. Nor was this an unheard-of phenomenon. The market crash of 1987, as well as the failure of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, also saw large declines in liquidity across broad segments of the market.

In fact, when liquidity in one stock decreases, it commonly tends to decrease in other stocks at the same time[22] In other words, variation in liquidity has an important systematic component. Not surprisingly, investors demand compensation for exposure to liquidity risk. The extra expected return for bearing liquidity risk modifies the CAPM expected return-beta relationship.

Following up on this insight, Amihud demonstrates that firms with greater liquidity risk have higher average returns.[23] Later studies focus on exposure to marketwide liquidity risk, as measured by a "liquidity beta." Analogously to a traditional market beta, the liquidity beta measures the sensitivity of a firm's returns to changes in market liquidity (whereas the traditional beta measures return sensitivity to the market return). Firms that provide better returns when market liquidity falls offer some protection against liquidity risk, and thus should be priced higher and offer lower expected returns. In fact, we will see in Chapter 13 that firms with high liquidity betas have offered higher average returns, just as theory predicts.[24] Moreover, the liquidity premium that emerges from

22See, for example, Tarun Chordia, Richard Roll, and Avanidhar Subrahmanyam, "Commonality in Liquidity," Journal of Financial Economics 56 (2000), pp. 3-28, or J. Hasbrouck and D. H. Seppi, "Common Factors in Prices, Order Flows and Liquidity," Journal of Financial Economics 59 (2001), pp. 383-411.

these studies appear to be of roughly the same order of magnitude as the market risk premium, suggesting that liquidity should be a first-order consideration when thinking about security pricing.

# 9.3 Issues in Testing the CAPM

Testing the CAPM is surprisingly difficult. We will look more systematically at these tests in Chapter 13. One long-standing thorn in the side of researchers is Assumption 1(a) (all assets trade), which leads to the result that the market portfolio must include all risky assets in the economy. In reality, we cannot even observe all the assets that do trade, let alone properly account for those that do not. The theoretical market portfolio, which is central to the CAPM, is impossible to pin down in practice.

Because the theoretical CAPM market portfolio cannot be observed, most tests of the model are directed at the mean-beta relationship as applied to assets with respect to an observed, but perhaps inefficient, stock index portfolio. But if the test rejects the model, is that because the model is faulty or because the index is a faulty proxy for the true market? And if we test one of the more general variants of the CAPM, how can we be sure that we have included a comprehensive set of extra-market hedge portfolios?

Moreover, where do we obtain the beta coefficients to use in our statistical tests? We must estimate them for each stock. These estimates are typically quite imprecise, which can lead to an incorrect rejection of the model.[25]

In addition, both alpha and beta, as well as residual variance, are likely time varying. There is nothing in the CAPM that precludes such time variation, but standard regression techniques rule it out and thus may lead to false rejection of the model. There are now well-known techniques to account for time-varying parameters. In fact, Robert Engle won the Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on econometric techniques to deal with time-varying volatility.[26] Nevertheless, these techniques have not salvaged the CAPM.

Finally, betas as well as the market risk premium may vary not purely randomly over time, but in response to changing economic conditions. A "conditional" CAPM allows risk and expected return to change with a set of "conditioning variables" that describe the state of the economy.[27] As importantly, the beta of a security can be decomposed into two components, one that measures sensitivity to changes in corporate profitability and another that measures sensitivity to changes in market discount rates. These are found to be quite different in many cases.[28]

25Merton H. Miller and Myron Scholes, "Rates of Return in Relations to Risk: A Re-Examination of Some Recent Findings," in Studies in the Theory of Capital Markets, ed. Michael C. Jensen (New York: Praeger, 1972).
26Engle's work gave rise to the widespread use of so-called ARCH models. ARCH stands for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, which is a fancy way of saying that volatility changes over time, and that recent levels of volatility can be used to form optimal estimates of future volatility.
[27]There is now a large volume of literature on conditional models of security market equilibrium. Much of it derives from Ravi Jagannathan and Zhenyu Wang, "The Conditional CAPM and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns," Journal of Finance 51 (March 1996), pp. 3-53.
28John Campbell and Tuomo Vuolteenaho, "Bad Beta, Good Beta," American Economic Review 94 (December 2004), pp. 1249-75.

A strand of research that has not yet yielded fruit is the search for portfolios that hedge the risk of specific consumption items, as in Merton's Equation 9.14. Portfolios that should hedge presumably important extra-market sources of risk have not resoundingly been found to predict risk premia.

As mentioned in Chapter 5, Fama and French documented the predictive power of size and book-to-market ratios (B/M) for asset returns. They interpret portfolios formed to align with these characteristics as hedging portfolios in the context of Equation 9.14. Following their lead, other papers have now suggested a number of other extra-market risk factors (discussed in the next chapter). But we don't really know what fundamental uncertainties in future investment opportunities are hedged by these factors, leading many to be skeptical of empirically driven identification of extra-market hedging portfolios.

The bottom line is that, in much of the research community, the single-index CAPM is considered passé. However, there is no broad consensus on what specific extension of the basic model should replace it. Stay tuned for future developments.

# 9.4 The CAPM and the Investment Industry

In many ways, portfolio theory and the CAPM have become accepted tools in the practitioner community. Many investment professionals think about the distinction between firm-specific and systematic risk and are comfortable with the use of beta to measure systematic risk. One extensive survey found that about three-quarters of financial managers use the CAPM when estimating the cost of capital.[29] In the asset management industry, alpha is regularly computed. On the other hand, compensation of portfolio managers is rarely based on alpha or other theoretically appropriate risk-adjusted measures such as those addressed later in the text (see Chapter 24).

What about the prediction that the passive market index is actually the most efficiently diversified portfolio that a mutual fund company can offer its clients? Interestingly, the CAPM proposition that the market portfolio is efficient cannot be tested because the true market portfolio of all assets cannot be observed in the first place. But it has become ever more evident that consistently beating even a less-than-fully-inclusive index such as the S&P 500 is already beyond the power of most investors, even professional ones.

Indirect evidence on the efficiency of the market can be found in hundreds of studies of the performance of professionally managed portfolios. By and large, the message of these studies, which we will review in Chapter 11, is that professional investors do not on average outperform passive market indexes. In fact, the average mutual fund alpha, net of fees, is negative in most years. Moreover, history provides little help in identifying the managers with the better prospects for superior performance: The funds that provide positive alphas in one year are typically not the ones that do so in the following year.

These results are important. While we might expect realized alpha values of individual securities to center around zero, professionally managed mutual funds might be expected to demonstrate average positive alphas. Funds with superior performance should tilt the sample average to a positive value. Their failure to do so suggests the difficulty in beating the passive strategy that the CAPM deems to be optimal.

From the standpoint of the industry, an index portfolio that can be beaten by only a tiny fraction of professional managers over a 10-year period may well be taken as ex-ante efficient for all practical purposes, that is, to be used as (1) a diversification vehicle to mix with an active portfolio from security analysis (discussed in Chapter 8); (2) a benchmark for performance evaluation and compensation (discussed in Chapter 24); (3) a means to adjudicate lawsuits about fair compensation to various risky enterprises; and (4) a means to determine proper prices in regulated industries, allowing shareholders to earn a fair rate of return on their investments, but no more.

# SUMMARY

1. The CAPM assumes that investors are single-period planners who agree on a common input list from security analysis and seek mean-variance optimal portfolios.
2. The CAPM assumes that security markets are ideal in the sense that:

$a$ . Relevant information about securities is widely and publicly available.
$b$ . There are no taxes or transaction costs.
$c$ . All risky assets are publicly traded.
$d$ . Investors can borrow and lend any amount at a fixed risk-free rate.

3. With these assumptions, all investors hold identical risky portfolios. The CAPM holds that in equilibrium the market portfolio is the unique mean-variance efficient tangency portfolio. Thus, a passive strategy is efficient.
4. The CAPM market portfolio is value-weighted. Each security is held in a proportion equal to its market value divided by the total market value of all securities.
5. If the market portfolio is efficient and the average investor neither borrows nor lends, then the risk premium on the market portfolio is proportional to its variance,  $\sigma_M^2$ , as well as the average coefficient of risk aversion across investors,  $\overline{A}$ :

$$
E (r _ {M}) - r _ {f} = \overline {{A}} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2}
$$

6. The CAPM implies that the risk premium on any individual asset or portfolio is the product of the risk premium on the market portfolio and the beta coefficient:

$$
E \left(r _ {i}\right) - r _ {f} = \beta_ {i} \left[ E \left(r _ {M}\right) - r _ {f} \right]
$$ where the beta coefficient is the covariance of the asset's excess return with that of the market portfolio as a fraction of the variance of the excess return of the market portfolio:


$$
\beta_ {i} = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} (R _ {i} , R _ {M})}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}}
$$

7. When risk-free borrowing is restricted but all other CAPM assumptions hold, then the simple version of the security market line is replaced by its zero-beta version. Accordingly, the risk-free rate in the expected return-beta relationship is replaced by the zero-beta portfolio's expected rate of return:

$$
E \left(r _ {i}\right) = E \left(r _ {Z}\right) + \beta_ {i} \left[ E \left(r _ {M}\right) - E \left(r _ {Z}\right) \right]
$$

8. The security market line of the CAPM must be modified to account for labor income and other significant nontraded assets.
9. The simple version of the CAPM assumes that investors have a single-period time horizon. When investors are assumed to be concerned with lifetime consumption and bequest plans, but investors' tastes and security return distributions are stable over time, the market portfolio remains efficient and the simple version of the expected return-beta relationship holds. But if those distributions change unpredictably, or if investors seek to hedge nonmarket sources of risk to their consumption, the simple CAPM gives way to a multifactor version in which the security's exposure to these nonmarket sources of risk command risk premiums.
10. The consumption-based capital asset pricing model (CCAPM) is a single-factor model in which the market portfolio excess return is replaced by that of a consumption-tracking portfolio. By appealing directly to consumption, the model naturally incorporates consumption-hedging considerations and changing investment opportunities within a single-factor framework.
11. Liquidity costs and liquidity risk can affect security pricing. Investors demand compensation for expected costs of illiquidity as well as the risk surrounding those costs.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. We can characterize the entire population by two representative investors. One is the "uninformed" investor, who does not engage in security analysis and holds the market portfolio, whereas the other optimizes using the Markowitz algorithm with input from security analysis. The uninformed investor does not know what input the informed investor uses to make portfolio purchases. The uninformed investor knows, however, that if the other investor is informed, the market portfolio proportions will be optimal. Therefore, to depart from these proportions would constitute an uninformed bet, which will, on average, reduce the efficiency of diversification with no compensating improvement in expected returns.


2. a. Substituting the historical mean and standard deviation in Equation 9.2 yields a coefficient of risk aversion of

$$
\bar {A} = \frac {E (r _ {M}) - r _ {f}}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} = \frac {. 0 8 9}{. 2 0 3 ^ {2}} = 2. 1 6
$$ b. This relationship also tells us that for the historical standard deviation and a coefficient of risk aversion of 3.5, the risk premium would be


$$
E \left(r _ {M}\right) - r _ {f} = \bar {A} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} = 3.5 \times .203 ^ {2} = .144 = 14.4 \%
$$

3. For these investment proportions,  $w_{\text{Ford}}$ ,  $w_{\text{Toyota}}$ , the portfolio  $\beta$  is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \beta_ {P} = w _ {\text {F o r d}} \beta_ {\text {F o r d}} + w _ {\text {T o y o t a}} \beta_ {\text {T o y o t a}} \\ = (. 7 5 \times 1. 2 5) + (. 2 5 \times 1. 1 0) = 1. 2 1 2 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

As the market risk premium,  $E(r_{M}) - r_{f}$ , is  $8\%$ , the portfolio risk premium will be

$$
\begin{array}{l} E \left(r _ {P}\right) - r _ {f} = \beta_ {P} \left[ E \left(r _ {M}\right) - r _ {f} \right] \\ = 1.2125 \times 8 = 9.7 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

4. The alpha of a stock is its expected return in excess of that required by the CAPM.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \alpha = E (r) - \left\{r _ {f} + \beta \left[ E \left(r _ {M}\right) - r _ {f} \right] \right\} \\ \alpha_ {X Y Z} = 12 - [ 5 + 1.0 (11 - 5) ] = 1 \% \\ \alpha_ {A B C} = 13 - [ 5 + 1.5 (11 - 5) ] = - 1 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

ABC plots below the SML, while  $XYZ$  plots above.

5. The project-specific required return is determined by the project beta together with the market risk premium and the risk-free rate. The CAPM tells us that an acceptable expected rate of return for the project is

$$ r _ {f} + \beta [ E (r _ {M}) - r _ {f} ] = 8 + 1.3 (16 - 8) = 18.4 \%
$$ which becomes the project's hurdle rate. If the IRR of the project is  $19\%$ , then it is desirable. Any project with an IRR equal to or less than  $18.4\%$  should be rejected.


# Arbitrage Pricing Theory and Multifactor Models of Risk and Return

# 10

THE EXPLOitation OF security mispricing in such a way that risk-free profits can be earned is called arbitrage. It involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of equivalent securities or portfolios in order to profit from discrepancies in their prices. Perhaps the most basic principle of capital market theory is that well-functioning security markets rule out arbitrage opportunities. If actual security prices did allow for arbitrage, the result would be strong pressure on prices that would quickly eliminate the opportunity. Therefore, we can expect security markets to satisfy a "no-arbitrage condition."

In this chapter, we show how no-arbitrage conditions, together with the factor model introduced in Chapter 8, allow us to generalize the security market line of the CAPM to gain richer insight into the risk-return relationship. We begin by showing how the decomposition of risk into market versus firm-specific influences that we introduced in earlier chapters can be extended to deal with the multifaceted nature of systematic risk. Multifactor models of security returns can be used to measure and manage exposure to each of many economywide factors such as business-cycle risk, interest or inflation rate risk, energy price risk, and so on. These models ultimately lead us to a multifactor version of the security market line in which risk premiums derive from exposure to multiple risk sources, each with its own risk premium.


This approach to the risk-return trade-off is called arbitrage pricing theory, or APT. In a single-factor market where there are no extra-market risk factors, the APT leads to a mean return-beta equation identical to that of the CAPM. In a multifactor market with one or more extra-market risk factors, the APT delivers a mean-beta equation similar to Merton's multifactor extension of the CAPM (his ICAPM). Finally, we ask how to identify the factors that are likely to be the most important sources of risk. These will be the factors generating substantial hedging demands that brought us to the multifactor CAPM introduced in Chapter 9. Both the APT and the CAPM therefore can lead to multiple-risk versions of the security market line, thereby enriching the insights we can derive about the risk-return relationship.

# 10.1 Multifactor Models: A Preview

The index model introduced in Chapter 8 gave us a way of decomposing stock return variability into market or systematic risk, due largely to macroeconomic events, versus firm-specific or idiosyncratic effects that can be diversified in large portfolios. In the single-index model, the return on a broad market-index portfolio summarized the impact of the macro factor. In Chapter 9 we introduced the possibility that risk premiums may also depend on correlations with extra-market risk factors such as inflation, or changes in the parameters describing future investment opportunities: interest rates, volatility, market-risk premiums, and betas. For example, returns on an asset whose return increases when inflation increases can be used to hedge uncertainty in the future inflation rate. Its price may rise and its risk premium may fall as a result of investors' extra demand for this asset.

Risk premiums of individual securities should reflect their sensitivities to extra-market risk factors just as their betas on the market index determine their risk premiums in the simple CAPM. When securities can be used to hedge these factors, the resulting hedging demands will turn the SML into a multifactor model, with each significant risk source generating an additional factor. Risk factors can be represented either by returns on these hedge portfolios (just as the index portfolio represents the market factor) or more directly by changes in the risk factors themselves, for example, changes in interest rates or inflation.

# Factor Models of Security Returns

We begin with a familiar single-factor model like the one introduced in Chapter 8. Uncertainty in asset returns has two sources: a common or macroeconomic factor and firm-specific events. By construction, the common factor has zero expected value because it measures new information concerning the macroeconomy; new information implies a revision to current expectations, and if initial expectations are rational, then such revisions should average out to zero.

If we call  $F$  the deviation of the common factor from its expected value,  $\beta_{i}$  the sensitivity of firm  $i$  to that factor, and  $e_{i}$  the firm-specific disturbance, the factor model states that the actual excess return on firm  $i$  will equal its initially expected value plus a (zero expected value) random amount attributable to unanticipated economywide events, plus another (zero expected value) random amount attributable to firm-specific events.

Formally, the single-factor model of excess returns is described by Equation 10.1:

$$
R _ {i} = E \left(R _ {i}\right) + \beta_ {i} F + e _ {i} \tag {10.1}
$$ where  $E(R_{i})$  is the expected excess return on stock  $i$ . Notice that if the macro factor has a value of 0 in any particular period (i.e., no macro surprises), the excess return on the security will equal its previously expected value,  $E(R_{i})$ , plus the effect of firm-specific events only. The nonsystematic components of returns, the  $e_{i}$ 's, are assumed to be uncorrelated across stocks and with the factor  $F$ .


# Example 10.1 Factor Models

To illustrate the factor model, suppose that the macro factor,  $F$ , represents news about the state of the business cycle, which we will measure by the unexpected percentage change in gross domestic product (GDP). The consensus is that GDP will increase by  $4\%$  this year. Suppose also that a stock's  $\beta$  value is 1.2. If GDP increases by only  $3\%$ , then the value of  $F$  would be  $-1\%$ , representing a  $1\%$  disappointment in actual versus expected growth. Given the stock's beta, this disappointment would translate into a stock return  $1.2\%$  lower than previously expected. This macro surprise, together with the firm-specific disturbance,  $e_{i}$ , determines the total departure of the stock's return from its originally expected value.

# Concept Check 10.1

Suppose you currently expect the stock in Example 10.1 to earn a  $10\%$  rate of return. Then some macroeconomic news suggests that GDP growth will come in at  $5\%$  instead of  $4\%$ . How will you revise your estimate of the stock's expected rate of return?

The factor model's decomposition of returns into systematic and firm-specific components is compelling, but confining systematic risk to a single factor is not. Indeed, when we motivated systematic risk as the source of risk premiums in Chapter 9, we noted that extra-market sources of risk may arise from a number of sources such as uncertainty about interest rates, inflation, and so on. The market return reflects all of these macro factors as well as the average sensitivity of firms to those factors.

It stands to reason that a more explicit representation of systematic risk, allowing different stocks to exhibit different sensitivities to its various components, would be a useful refinement of the single-factor model. Models that allow for several factors—multifactor models—can provide better descriptions of security returns.

Apart from their use in building models of equilibrium security pricing, multifactor models are useful in risk management applications. They give us a simple way to measure investor exposure to various macroeconomic risks and construct portfolios to hedge those risks.

Let's start with a two-factor model. Suppose the two most important macroeconomic sources of risk are uncertainties surrounding the state of the business cycle, news of which we will again measure by unanticipated growth in GDP, and changes in interest rates. We will denote by IR any unexpected change in interest rates. The return on any stock will respond to each source of macro risk as well as its own firm-specific influences. We can write a two-factor model describing the excess return on stock  $i$  in some time period as follows:

$$
R _ {i} = E \left(R _ {i}\right) + \beta_ {i \mathrm {G D P}} \mathrm {G D P} + \beta_ {i \mathrm {I R}} \mathrm {I R} + e _ {i} \tag {10.2}
$$

The two macro factors on the right-hand side of the equation comprise the systematic factors in the economy. As in the single-factor model, both of these macro factors have zero expectation: They represent changes in these variables that have not already been anticipated. The coefficients of each factor in Equation 10.2 measure the sensitivity of share returns to that factor. For this reason, the coefficients are sometimes called factor loadings or, equivalently, factor betas. An increase in interest rates is bad news for most firms, so we would expect interest rate betas generally to be negative. As before,  $e_i$  reflects firm-specific influences.

To illustrate the advantages of multifactor models, consider two firms, one a regulated electric-power utility in a mostly residential area and the other an airline. Because residential demand for electricity is not very sensitive to the business cycle, the utility has a low beta on GDP. But the utility's stock price may have a relatively high sensitivity to interest rates. Because the cash flow generated by the utility is relatively stable, its present value behaves much like that of a bond, varying inversely with interest rates. Conversely, the performance of the airline is very sensitive to economic activity but is less sensitive to interest rates. It will have a high GDP beta and a lower interest rate beta. Suppose that on a particular day, a news item suggests that the economy will expand. GDP is expected to increase, but so are interest rates. Is the "macro news" on this day good or bad? For the utility, this is bad news: Its dominant sensitivity is to rates. But for the airline, which responds more to GDP, this is good news. Clearly a one-factor or single-index model cannot capture such differential responses to varying sources of macroeconomic uncertainty.


# Example 10.2 Risk Assessment Using Multifactor Models

Suppose we estimate the two-factor model in Equation 10.2 for Northeast Airlines and find the following result:

$$
R = . 1 3 3 + 1. 2 (\mathrm {G D P}) - . 3 (\mathrm {I R}) + e
$$

This tells us that, based on currently available information, the expected excess rate of return for Northeast is  $13.3\%$ , but that for every percentage point increase in GDP beyond current expectations, the return on Northeast's shares increases on average by  $1.2\%$ , while for every unanticipated percentage point that interest rates increase, Northeast's shares fall on average by  $0.3\%$ .

Factor betas can provide a framework for a hedging strategy. Investors concerned with their current exposure to one or another macro factor might offset that risk by initiating a position with equal but opposite exposure. Often, futures contracts can be used to hedge a particular factor risk. We explore this application in Chapter 22.

Like the index model of Chapter 8, the multifactor model is no more than a description of the factors that affect security returns. There is no "theory" in the equation. The obvious question left unanswered by Equation 10.2 is where  $E(R)$  comes from, in other words, what determines a security's expected excess rate of return. Arbitrage pricing theory provides the answer to this question.

# 10.2 Arbitrage Pricing Theory

Stephen Ross developed the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) in 1976. Like the CAPM, the APT predicts a security market line linking expected returns to risk, but the path it takes to the SML is quite different. Ross's APT relies on three key propositions: (1) Security returns can be described by a factor model, (2) there are sufficient securities to diversify away idiosyncratic risk, and (3) well-functioning security markets do not allow arbitrage opportunities to persist. We begin with a simple version of Ross's model, which assumes that only one systematic factor affects security returns. Once we understand how the model works, it will be much easier to see how it can be generalized to accommodate more than one factor.

# Arbitrage, Risk Arbitrage, and Equilibrium

An arbitrage opportunity arises when an investor can earn riskless profits without making a net investment. A trivial example of an arbitrage opportunity would arise if shares of a stock sold for different prices on two different exchanges. For example, suppose Microsoft sold for  \$310 on the NYSE but only\$ 305 on NASDAQ. Then you could buy the shares on NASDAQ and simultaneously sell them on the NYSE, clearing a riskless profit of 5 per share without tying up any of your own capital. The Law of One Price states that if two assets are equivalent in all economically relevant respects, then they should have the same price. The Law of One Price is enforced by arbitrageurs: If they observe a violation of the law, they will engage in arbitrage activity—simultaneously buying the asset where it is cheap and selling where it is expensive. In the process, they will bid up the price where it is low and force it down where it is high until the opportunity is eliminated.

Strategies that exploit violations of the Law of One Price all involve long–short positions. You buy the relatively cheap asset and sell the relatively overpriced one. The net investment, therefore, is zero. Moreover, the position is riskless. Therefore, any investor, regardless of risk aversion or wealth, will want to take an infinite position in it. Because those large positions will quickly force prices up or down until the opportunity vanishes, security prices should satisfy a “no-arbitrage condition,” that is, a condition that rules out the existence of arbitrage opportunities.

The idea that market prices will move to rule out arbitrage opportunities is perhaps the most fundamental concept in capital market theory. Violation of this restriction would indicate the grossest form of market irrationality.

There is an important difference between arbitrage and risk-return dominance arguments in support of equilibrium price relationships. A dominance argument holds that when an equilibrium price relationship is violated, many investors will make limited portfolio changes, depending on their degree of risk aversion. Aggregation of these limited portfolio changes is required to create a large volume of buying and selling, which in turn restores equilibrium prices. By contrast, when arbitrage opportunities exist, each investor wants to take as large a position as possible; hence, it will not take many investors to bring about the price pressures necessary to restore equilibrium. Therefore, implications for prices derived from no-arbitrage arguments are stronger than implications derived from a risk-return dominance argument.

The CAPM is an example of a dominance argument, implying that all investors hold mean-variance efficient portfolios. If a security is mispriced, investors will tilt their portfolios toward the underpriced and away from the overpriced securities. Pressure on equilibrium prices results from many investors shifting their portfolios, each by a relatively small dollar amount. The assumption that a large number of investors are mean-variance optimizers is critical. In contrast, the implication of a no-arbitrage condition is that a few investors who identify an arbitrage opportunity will mobilize large dollar amounts and quickly restore equilibrium.

Practitioners often use the terms arbitrage and arbitrageurs more loosely than our strict definition. Arbitrageur often refers to a professional searching for mispriced securities in specific areas such as merger-target stocks, rather than to one who seeks strict (risk-free) arbitrage opportunities. Such activity is sometimes called risk arbitrage to distinguish it from pure arbitrage.

# Diversification in a Single-Factor Security Market

We begin by considering the risk of a portfolio of stocks in a single-factor market. We first show that if a portfolio is well diversified, its firm-specific or nonfactor risk becomes negligible, so that only factor (equivalently, systematic) risk remains. The excess return,  $R_P$ , on an  $n$ -stock portfolio with weights  $w_i$ ,  $\sum w_i = 1$ , is


$$
R _ {P} = E \left(R _ {P}\right) + \beta_ {P} F + e _ {P} \tag {10.3}
$$ where


$$
\beta_ {P} = \sum w _ {i} \beta_ {i}; E (R _ {P}) = \sum w _ {i} E (R _ {i})
$$ are the weighted averages of the  $\beta_{i}$  and risk premiums of the  $n$  securities. The portfolio nonsystematic return (which is uncorrelated with  $F$ ) is  $e_{P} = \sum w_{i} e_{i}$ , which similarly is a weighted average of the  $e_{i}$  of the  $n$  securities.


There are two random (and uncorrelated) terms on the right-hand side of Equation 10.3, so we can separate the variance of the portfolio into its systematic and nonsystematic sources:

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \beta_ {P} ^ {2} \sigma_ {F} ^ {2} + \sigma^ {2} (e _ {P})
$$ where  $\sigma_F^2$  is the variance of the factor  $F$  and  $\sigma^2 (e_P)$  is the nonsystematic variance of the portfolio, which is given by


$$
\sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {P}\right) = \operatorname {V a r i a n c e} \left(\sum w _ {i} e _ {i}\right) = \sum w _ {i} ^ {2} \sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {i}\right)
$$

In deriving the nonsystematic variance of the portfolio, we depend on the fact that the firm-specific  $e_i$ s are uncorrelated (so all covariances across assets are zero) and, hence, the variance of the "portfolio" of nonsystematic  $e_i$ s is the weighted sum of the individual nonsystematic variances with the square of the investment proportions as weights.

If the portfolio were equally weighted,  $w_{i} = 1 / n$ , then the nonsystematic variance would be

$$
\sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {P}\right) = \sum w _ {i} ^ {2} \sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {i}\right) = \sum \left(\frac {1}{n}\right) ^ {2} \sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {i}\right) = \frac {1}{n} \sum \frac {\sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {i}\right)}{n} = \frac {1}{n} \bar {\sigma} ^ {2} \left(e _ {i}\right) \tag {10.4}
$$ where the last term is the average value of nonsystematic variance across securities. In words, the nonsystematic variance of the portfolio equals the average nonsystematic variance divided by  $n$ . Therefore, as  $n$  increases, nonsystematic variance falls. This is the effect of diversification.


We see this effect dramatically in the scatter diagram of Figure 10.1. The square reddish points are the monthly returns over a five-year period for a single stock, Intel. The round blue points are for a diversified stock mutual fund, Vanguard's Growth & Income Fund. During the period, both the stock and the fund had virtually identical betas. But their nonsystematic risk differed considerably: The scatter of Intel's returns falls considerably further from the regression line than the mutual fund's, for which diversification has eliminated most residual risk.

In sum, the number of securities in the portfolio has no bearing on systematic risk. Only average beta matters. In contrast, firm-specific risk becomes increasingly irrelevant as the portfolio becomes more diversified. You can see where we are going. Risk premiums should depend only on systematic risk that cannot be diversified; firm-specific risk should not command a risk premium because it is easily eliminated.

# Well-Diversified Portfolios

Equation 10.4 tells us that as diversification progresses, that is, as the weight in each security approaches zero, the nonsystematic variance of the portfolio approaches zero. We will define a well-diversified portfolio as one for which each weight,  $w_{i}$ , is small enough that for practical purposes the nonsystematic variance,  $\sigma^2 (e_P)$ , is negligible.

# Concept Check 10.2 a. A portfolio is invested in a very large number of shares (  $n$  is large). However, one-half of the portfolio is invested in stock 1, and the rest of the portfolio is equally divided among the other  $n - 1$  shares. Is this portfolio well diversified?

b. Another portfolio also is invested in the same  $n$  shares, where  $n$  is very large. Instead of equally weighting with portfolio weights of  $1/n$  in each stock, the weights in half the securities are  $1.5/n$  while the weights in the other shares are  $.5/n$ . Is this portfolio well diversified?

Because the expected value of  $e_P$  for any well-diversified portfolio is zero, and its variance also is effectively zero, any realized value of  $e_P$  will be virtually zero. Rewriting Equation 10.1, we conclude that, for a well-diversified portfolio, for all practical purposes

$$
R _ {P} = E (R _ {P}) + \beta_ {P} F
$$

The solid line in Figure 10.2, Panel A, plots the excess return of a well-diversified portfolio  $A$  with  $E(R_{A}) = 10\%$  and  $\beta_{A} = 1$  for various realizations of the systematic factor. The expected return of portfolio  $A$  is  $10\%$ ; this is where the solid line crosses the vertical axis. At this point, the systematic factor is zero, implying no macro surprises. If the macro

B factor is positive, the portfolio's return exceeds its expected value; if it is negative, the portfolio's return falls short of its mean. The excess return on the portfolio is therefore


$$
E \left(R _ {A}\right) + \beta_ {A} F = 10 \% + 1.0 \times F
$$

Compare Panel A in Figure 10.2 with Panel B, which is a similar graph for a single stock  $(S)$  with  $\beta_{S} = 1$ . The undiversified stock is subject to nonsystematic risk, which is seen in a scatter of points around the line. The well-diversified portfolio's return, in contrast, is determined completely by the systematic factor.

# The Security Market Line of the APT

Nonsystematic risk is negligible in well-diversified portfolios, and one would not expect investors to be rewarded for bearing risk that can be eliminated through diversification. Therefore, only systematic or factor risk should be related to portfolio expected returns. This is the basis of the security market line that we are now ready to derive.

First, we show that all well-diversified portfolios with the same beta must have the same expected return. Figure 10.3 plots the returns on two such portfolios,  $A$  and  $B$ , both with betas of 1, but with differing expected returns:  $E(r_{A}) = 10\%$  and  $E(r_{B}) = 8\%$ . Could portfolios  $A$  and  $B$  coexist with the return pattern depicted? Clearly not: No matter what the systematic factor turns out to be, portfolio  $A$  outperforms portfolio  $B$ , leading to an arbitrage opportunity.

If you sell short  \$1 million of B$  and buy 1 million of  $A$ , a zero-net-investment strategy, you would have a riskless payoff of 20,000, as follows:

$$
(. 1 0 + 1. 0 \times F) \times \$ 1 \text {m i l l o n} \quad \text {f r o m l o n g p o s i t i o n i n} A
$$

$$
- (0. 0 8 + 1. 0 \times F) \times \$ 1 \text {m i l l o n} \quad \text {f r o m s h o r t p o s i t i o n i n} B
$$

$$
. 0 2 \times \$ 1 \text {m i l l o n} = \$ 2 0, 0 0 0 \quad \text {n e t p r o c e s d s}
$$

Figure 10.3 Returns as a function of the systematic factor: An arbitrage opportunity

Your profit is risk-free because the factor risk cancels out across the long and short positions. Moreover, the strategy requires zero-net-investment. You (and others) will pursue it on an infinitely large scale until the resulting pressure on security prices forces the return discrepancy between the two portfolios to disappear. We conclude that such arbitrage activity ensures that well-diversified portfolios with equal betas will have equal expected returns.

What about portfolios with different betas? Their risk premiums must be proportional to beta. To see why, consider Figure 10.4. Suppose that the risk-free rate is  $4\%$  and that a well-diversified portfolio,  $C$ , with a beta of .5, has an expected return of  $6\%$ . Portfolio  $C$  plots below the line from the risk-free asset to portfolio  $A$ . Consider, therefore, a new portfolio,  $D$ , composed of half of portfolio  $A$  and half of the risk-free asset. Portfolio  $D$ 's beta will be  $(.5 \times 0 + .5 \times 1.0) = .5$ , and its expected return will be  $(.5 \times 4 + .5 \times 10) = 7\%$ . Now portfolio  $D$  has an equal beta but a greater expected return than portfolio  $C$ . From our analysis of Figure 10.3 in the previous paragraph we know that this constitutes an arbitrage opportunity. We conclude that, to preclude arbitrage opportunities, the expected return on all well-diversified portfolios must lie on the straight line from the risk-free asset in Figure 10.4.

Notice in Figure 10.4 that risk premiums are indeed proportional to portfolio betas. The risk premium is depicted by the vertical arrow, which measures the distance between the risk-free rate and the expected return on the portfolio. As in the simple CAPM, the risk premium is zero for  $\beta = 0$  and rises in direct proportion to  $\beta$ .

Figure 10.4 relates the risk premium on well-diversified portfolios to their betas. As a final step, we would like a security market line that relates the portfolio risk premium to its beta against a market index rather than an unspecified macro factor.

Fortunately, this last step is easy to justify. This is because all well-diversified portfolios are perfectly correlated with the macro factor. (Again, look at Figure 10.2, Panel A, which shows that the scatter plot for any well-diversified portfolio lies precisely on the straight line.) Therefore, if a market index portfolio is well diversified, its return will perfectly reflect the value of the macro factor. This means that betas measured against the market index are just as informative about relative levels of systematic risk as are betas measured against the macro factor.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/42af0ecc9cecf7f465ca137c84ee9d1d0c692a83e3d047371a534746a1f7063b.jpg)
Figure 10.4 An arbitrage opportunity


Therefore, we can write the excess return on a well-diversified portfolio  $P$  as:

$$
R _ {P} = \alpha_ {P} + \beta_ {P} R _ {M} \tag {10.5}
$$ where  $\beta_{P}$  now denotes the beta against the well-diversified market index.


We know that risk premiums must rise in proportion to beta. Therefore, if a portfolio has (let's say) twice the beta against the macro factor as the market index, its beta with respect to the index will be 2, and it should have twice the risk premium. More generally, for any well-diversified portfolio  $P$ , the expected excess return must be:

$$
E \left(R _ {P}\right) = \beta_ {P} E \left(R _ {M}\right) \tag {10.6}
$$

In other words, the risk premium (i.e., the expected excess return) on portfolio  $P$  is the product of its beta and the risk premium of the market index. Equation 10.6 thus establishes that the SML of the CAPM must also apply to well-diversified portfolios simply by virtue of the "no-arbitrage" requirement of the APT.

Individual Assets and the APT We have demonstrated that if arbitrage opportunities are to be ruled out, each well-diversified portfolio's expected return must satisfy the SML predicted by the CAPM. The natural question is whether this relationship tells us anything about the expected returns on the component stocks. The answer is that if this relationship is to be satisfied by all well-diversified portfolios, it must be satisfied by almost all individual securities, although a rigorous proof of this proposition is somewhat difficult. We can illustrate the argument less formally.


Suppose that the expected return-beta relationship is violated for all single assets. Now create a pair of well-diversified portfolios from these assets. What are the chances that in spite of the fact that for any pair of assets the relationship does not hold, the relationship will hold for both well-diversified portfolios? The chances are small, but it is perhaps possible that the relationships among the single securities are violated in offsetting ways so that somehow it holds for the pair of well-diversified portfolios.

Now construct yet another well-diversified portfolio. What are the chances that the violations of the relationships for single securities are such that this third portfolio also will fulfill the no-arbitrage expected return-beta relationship? Obviously, the chances are smaller still. Continue with a fourth well-diversified portfolio, and so on. If the no-arbitrage expected return-beta relationship has to hold for each of these different, well-diversified portfolios, it must be virtually certain that the relationship holds for all but a small number of individual securities.

We use the term virtually certain advisedly because we must distinguish this conclusion from the statement that all securities surely fulfill this relationship. The reason we cannot make the latter statement has to do with a property of well-diversified portfolios.

Recall that to qualify as well diversified, a portfolio must have very small positions in all securities. If, for example, only one security violates the expected return-beta relationship, then the effect of this violation on a well-diversified portfolio will be too small to be of importance for any practical purpose, and meaningful arbitrage opportunities will not arise. But if many securities violate the expected return-beta relationship, the relationship will no longer hold even approximately for well-diversified portfolios, and arbitrage opportunities will be available. Consequently, we conclude that the no-arbitrage condition for a single-factor security market implies the expected return-beta relationship for all well-diversified portfolios and for all but possibly a small number of individual securities.

# Well-Diversified Portfolios in Practice

What is the effect of diversification on portfolio standard deviation in practice, where portfolio size is not unlimited? To illustrate, consider the residual standard deviation of a 1,000-stock portfolio with equal weights on each component stock. If the annualized residual standard deviation for each stock is  $\sigma(e_i) = 40\%$ , then the portfolio achieves a small but still not negligible standard deviation of  $40 / \sqrt{1,000} = 1.26\%$ .

What is a "large" portfolio? Many widely held ETFs or mutual funds hold hundreds of different shares, but very few hold more than 1,000. Therefore, for plausible portfolios, even broad diversification is not likely to achieve the risk reduction of the APT's "well-diversified" ideal. This is a shortcoming in the model. On the other hand, even the levels of residual risk attainable in practice should make the APT's security market line at the very least a good approximation to the risk-return relation. We address the comparative strengths of the APT and the CAPM as models of risk and return in the next section.

# 10.3 The APT and the CAPM

The APT serves many of the same functions as the CAPM. It gives us a benchmark for rates of return that can be used in capital budgeting, security valuation, or investment performance evaluation. Moreover, it highlights the crucial distinction between nondiversifiable risk (factor risk), which requires a reward in the form of a risk premium, and diversifiable risk, which does not.

In many ways, the APT is an extremely appealing model. It does not require that almost all investors be mean-variance optimizers. Instead, it is built on the highly plausible assumption that a rational capital market will preclude arbitrage opportunities. A violation of the APT's pricing relationships will cause extremely strong pressure to restore them. Moreover, the APT provides an expected return-beta relationship using as a benchmark a well-diversified index portfolio rather than the elusive and impossible-to-observe market portfolio of all assets that underpins the CAPM. When we replace the unobserved market portfolio of the CAPM with a broad, but observable, index portfolio, we can no longer be sure that this portfolio will be an adequate benchmark for the CAPM's security market line.

In spite of these apparent advantages, the APT does not fully dominate the CAPM. The CAPM provides an unequivocal statement on the expected return-beta relationship for all securities, whereas the APT implies that this relationship holds for all but perhaps a small proportion of these securities. Because the APT is built on the foundation of well-diversified portfolios, it cannot rule out a violation of the expected return-beta relationship for any particular asset. Moreover, we've seen that even large portfolios may have nonnegligible residual risk.

In the end, however, it is noteworthy and comforting that despite the very different paths they take to get there, both models arrive at the same security market line. Most important, they both highlight the distinction between firm-specific and systematic risk, which is at the heart of all modern models of risk and return.

# 10.4 A Multifactor APT

So far, we've examined the APT in a one-factor world. In reality, as we pointed out above, there are several sources of systematic risk such as uncertainty in the business cycle, interest rates, energy prices, and so on. Presumably, exposure to any of these factors will affect a stock's appropriate expected return. The APT can be generalized to accommodate these multiple sources of risk in a manner much like the multifactor CAPM.

Suppose that we generalize the single-factor model expressed in Equation 10.1 to a two-factor model:

$$
R _ {i} = E \left(R _ {i}\right) + \beta_ {i 1} F _ {1} + \beta_ {i 2} F _ {2} + e _ {i} \tag {10.7}
$$

In Example 10.2, factor 1 was the departure of GDP growth from expectations and factor 2 was the unanticipated change in interest rates. Each factor has zero expected value because each measures the surprise in (rather than the level of) the systematic variable. Similarly, the firm-specific component of unexpected return,  $e_i$ , also has zero expected value. Extending such a two-factor model to any number of factors is straightforward.

The benchmark portfolios in the APT are factor portfolios, which are well-diversified portfolios constructed to have a beta of 1 on one of the factors and a beta of zero on any other factor. We can think of each factor portfolio as a tracking portfolio. That is, the returns on such a portfolio track the evolution of one particular source of macroeconomic risk but are uncorrelated with other sources of risk. It is possible to form such factor portfolios because we have a large number of securities to choose from, and a relatively small number of factors. The multifactor SML predicts that the contribution of each source of risk to the security's total risk premium equals the factor beta times the risk premium of the factor portfolio tracking that source of risk. We illustrate with an example.

# Example 10.3 Multifactor SML

Suppose that the two factor portfolios, portfolios 1 and 2, have expected returns  $E(r_1) = 10\%$  and  $E(r_2) = 12\%$  and that the risk-free rate is  $4\%$ . The risk premium on the first factor portfolio is  $10\% - 4\% = 6\%$ , and that on the second factor portfolio is  $12\% - 4\% = 8\%$ .

Now consider a well-diversified portfolio, portfolio  $A$ , with beta on the first factor portfolio,  $\beta_{A1} = .5$ , and beta on the second factor portfolio,  $\beta_{A2} = .75$ . The multifactor APT states that the overall risk premium on this portfolio should equal the sum of the risk premiums required as compensation for each source of systematic risk.

The risk premium attributable to risk factor 1 is the portfolio's exposure to factor 1,  $\beta_{A1}$ , multiplied by the risk premium earned on the first factor portfolio,  $E(r_1) - r_f$ . Therefore, the portion of portfolio  $A$  's risk premium that is compensation for its exposure to the first factor is  $\beta_{A1}[E(r_1) - r_f] = .5(10\% -4\%) = 3\%$ . Similarly, the risk premium attributable to risk factor 2 is proportional to the exposure to that factor. The total equilibrium expected return on portfolio  $A$  therefore would be the sum of the risk-free rate plus total compensation for all sources of risk:

4\% Risk-free rate  $r_f = 4\%$
+3\% Risk premium for exposure to factor 1  $\beta_{A1}\times [E(r_1) - r_l] = .5\times 6\%$
+6\% Risk premium for exposure to factor 2  $\beta_{A2}\times [E(r_2) - r_d] = .75\times 8\%$
$= 13\%$  Total expected return  $r_f + \beta_{A1}[E(r_1) - r_f] + \beta_{A2}[E(r_2) - r_f]$

To generalize Example 10.3, note that the factor exposures of any portfolio,  $P$ , are given by its betas,  $\beta_{P1}$  and  $\beta_{P2}$ . A competing portfolio,  $Q$ , can be formed by investing in factor portfolios with the following weights:  $\beta_{P1}$  in the first factor portfolio,  $\beta_{P2}$  in the second factor portfolio, and  $1 - \beta_{P1} - \beta_{P2}$  in T-bills. By construction, portfolio  $Q$  will have betas equal to those of portfolio  $P$  and expected return of

$$
\begin{array}{l} E \left(r _ {Q}\right) = \beta_ {P 1} E \left(r _ {1}\right) + \beta_ {P 2} E \left(r _ {2}\right) + \left(1 - \beta_ {P 1} - \beta_ {P 2}\right) r _ {f} \\ = r _ {f} + \beta_ {P 1} [ E (r _ {1}) - r _ {f} ] + \beta_ {P 2} [ E (r _ {2}) - r _ {f} ] \tag {10.8} \\ \end{array}
$$

This is a two-factor SML, and, as Example 10.4 now shows, any well-diversified portfolio with the same betas must have the same expected return as long as capital markets do not allow for easy arbitrage opportunities.

# Example 10.4 Mispricing and Arbitrage

Using the numbers in Example 10.3, the expected return on portfolio A should be:

$$
E (r _ {A}) = 4 + . 5 \times (1 0 - 4) + . 7 5 \times (1 2 - 4) = 1 3
$$

Suppose its expected return is actually  $12\%$  rather than  $13\%$ . This would give rise to the following arbitrage opportunity.

Form portfolio  $Q$  from the factor portfolios with the same betas as portfolio  $A$ . This requires weights of .5 on the first factor portfolio, .75 on the second factor portfolio, and -.25 on the risk-free asset. This portfolio has exactly the same factor betas as portfolio  $A$ : It has a beta of .5 on the first factor because of its .5 weight on the first factor portfolio, and a beta of .75 on the second factor. (The weight of -.25 on risk-free T-bills does not affect the sensitivity to either factor.)

Now invest  \$1 in portfolio Q and sell (short)\$ 1 in portfolio A. Your net investment is zero, but your expected dollar profit is positive and equal to

$$
\$ 1 \times E (r _ {Q}) - \$ 1 \times E (r _ {A}) = \$ 1 \times . 1 3 - \$ 1 \times . 1 2 = \$ . 0 1
$$

Moreover, your position is riskless. Your exposure to each risk factor cancels out because you are long  \$1 in portfolio Q and short\$ 1 in portfolio A, and both of these well-diversified portfolios have exactly the same factor betas. Thus, if portfolio A's expected return differs from that of portfolio Q's, you can earn positive risk-free profits on a zero-net-investment position. This is an arbitrage opportunity.

Because portfolio  $Q$  in Example 10.4 has precisely the same exposures as portfolio  $A$  to the two sources of risk, their expected returns also ought to be equal. So portfolio  $A$  also ought to have an expected return of  $13\%$ . If it does not, then there will be an arbitrage opportunity and great pressure on prices until the opportunity is eliminated. We conclude that any well-diversified portfolio with betas  $\beta_{P1}$  and  $\beta_{P2}$  must have the expected return given in Equation 10.8.

# Concept Check 10.3

Using the factor portfolios of Example 10.3, find the equilibrium rate of return on a well-diversified portfolio with  $\beta_{1} = .2$  and  $\beta_{2} = 1.4$ .

Finally, the extension of the multifactor SML of Equation 10.8 to individual assets is precisely the same as for the one-factor APT. Equation 10.8 cannot be satisfied by every well-diversified portfolio unless it is satisfied by almost all individual securities. Equation 10.8 thus represents the multifactor SML for an economy with multiple sources of risk.

Elton, Gruber, and Mei* use the APT to derive the cost of capital for electric utilities. They consider six potential systematic risk factors: unanticipated developments in the term structure of interest rates, the level of interest rates, inflation rates, the business cycle (measured by GDP), foreign exchange rates, and a summary measure they devise to measure other macro factors.

Their first step is to estimate the risk premium associated with exposure to each risk source. They accomplish this in a two-step strategy (which we will describe in detail in Chapter 13):

1. Estimate "factor loadings" (i.e., betas) of a large sample of firms. Regress returns of 100 randomly selected stocks against the five systematic factors. They use a time-series regression for each stock (e.g., 60 months of data), therefore estimating 100 regressions, one for each stock.
2. Estimate the reward earned per unit of exposure to each risk factor. For each month, regress the return of each stock against the five betas estimated. The coefficient on each beta is the extra average return earned as beta increases (i.e., it is an estimate of the risk premium for that risk factor from that month's data). These estimates are of course subject to sampling error. Therefore, average the risk premium estimates across months. The average response of return to risk is less subject to sampling error.

The risk premiums are in the middle column of the table in the next column.

Notice that some risk premiums are negative. The risk premium should be positive for risk factors you don't want exposure to, but negative for factors you do want exposure to. For example, you should desire securities that have higher returns when inflation increases and be willing to accept lower expected returns on such securities; this shows up as a negative risk premium.

<table><tr><td>Factor</td><td>Factor Risk Premium</td><td>Factor Betas for Niagara Mohawk</td></tr><tr><td>Term structure</td><td>0.425</td><td>1.0615</td></tr><tr><td>Interest rates</td><td>-0.051</td><td>-2.4167</td></tr><tr><td>Exchange rates</td><td>-0.049</td><td>1.3235</td></tr><tr><td>Business cycle</td><td>0.041</td><td>0.1292</td></tr><tr><td>Inflation</td><td>-0.069</td><td>-0.5220</td></tr><tr><td>Other macro factors</td><td>0.530</td><td>0.3046</td></tr></table>

The table implies that average returns are related to factor betas as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {f} +. 4 2 5 \beta_ {\text {t e r m s t r u c}} - . 0 5 1 \beta_ {\text {i n t r a t e}} \\ - . 0 4 9 \beta_ {\text {e x r a t e}} +. 0 4 1 \beta_ {\text {b u s c y c l e}} - . 0 6 9 \beta_ {\text {i n f l a t i o n}} +. 5 3 0 \beta_ {\text {o t h e r}} \\ \end{array}
$$

Finally, to obtain the cost of capital for a particular firm, the authors estimate the firm's betas against each source of risk, multiply each factor beta by the "cost of factor risk" from the table above, sum over all risk sources to obtain the total risk premium, and add the risk-free rate.

For example, the beta estimates for Niagara Mohawk appear in the last column of the table above. Therefore, its cost of capital is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {C o s t} = r _ {f} +. 4 2 5 (1. 0 6 1 5) - 0. 5 1 (- 2. 4 1 6 7) \\ - . 0 4 9 (1. 3 2 3 5) +. 0 4 1 (. 1 2 9 2) \\ - . 0 6 9 (-. 5 2 2 0) +. 5 3 0 (. 3 0 4 6) \\ = r _ {f} +. 7 2 \\ \end{array}
$$

In other words, the monthly cost of capital for Niagara Mohawk is .72\% above the monthly risk-free rate. Its annualized risk premium is therefore .72\% × 12 = 8.64\%.

We pointed out earlier that one application of the CAPM is to provide "fair" rates of return for regulated utilities. The multifactor APT can be used to the same end. The nearby box summarizes a study in which the APT was applied to find the cost of capital for regulated electric companies. Notice that empirical estimates for interest rate and inflation risk premiums in the box are negative, as we argued was reasonable in our discussion of Example 10.2.

# 10.5 The Fama-French (FF) Three-Factor Model

The APT shows us how multiple risk factors can result in a multifactor SML. But how can we identify the most likely sources of systematic risk? One approach comes from Merton's multifactor CAPM, discussed in Chapter 9, in which the extra-market risk factors are due to hedging demands against a range of risks associated with either consumption or investment opportunities. Another approach, which is far more common, uses firm characteristics that seem on empirical grounds to proxy for exposure to systematic risk. The factors chosen are variables that on past evidence have predicted average returns well and therefore may be capturing risk premiums. One example of this approach is the Fama and French three-factor model and its many extensions, which have come to dominate empirical research in security returns:4


$$
R _ {i t} = \alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {i M} R _ {M t} + \beta_ {i S M B} \mathrm {S M B} _ {t} + \beta_ {i H M L} \mathrm {H M L} _ {t} + e _ {i t} \tag {10.9}
$$ where


SMB = Small Minus Big (i.e., the return of a portfolio of small stocks in excess of the return on a portfolio of large stocks).

HML = High Minus Low (i.e., the return of a portfolio of stocks with a high book-to-market ratio in excess of the return on a portfolio of stocks with a low book-to-market ratio).

The market index is the first of the Fama-French factors and is expected to capture systematic risk originating from macroeconomic factors.

The two extra-market factors are chosen because of long-standing observations that firm size, measured by market capitalization (the market value of outstanding equity), and the book-to-market ratio (book value per share divided by stock price) predict deviations of average stock returns from levels consistent with the CAPM. Fama and French justify this model on empirical grounds: While SMB and HML are not themselves obvious candidates for relevant risk factors, the argument is that they may proxy for hard-to-measure more-fundamental variables. For example, Fama and French point out that firms with high book-to-market ratios are more likely to be in financial distress and that small stocks may be more vulnerable to deterioration in business conditions. Thus, these variables may capture sensitivity to risk factors in the macroeconomy. More evidence on the Fama-French model appears in Chapter 13.

The problem with empirical approaches such as the Fama-French model is that the extra-market factors in these models cannot be clearly identified with a source of risk that is of obvious concern to a significant group of investors. Black points out that when researchers scan and rescan the database of security returns in search of explanatory factors (an activity often called data-snooping), they may eventually uncover past "patterns" that are due purely to chance. However, Fama and French have shown that size and book-to-market ratios have predicted average returns in different time periods and in markets all over the world, thus mitigating potential effects of data-snooping.

$^{4}$ Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French, "Multifactor Explanations of Asset Pricing Anomalies," Journal of Finance 51 (1996), pp. 55-84.
Interpreting the returns on the SMB and HML portfolios is a bit subtle because both portfolios are zero-net-investment positions, long in one portfolio (e.g., small firms) and short in another (big firms). Therefore, one cannot compute profit per dollar invested. The "return" for the SMB portfolio is actually the profit on the overall position per dollar invested in the small-cap firms (or, equivalently, per dollar shorted in the large-cap firms). By the way, the market excess return is also a zero-net-investment portfolio: Every dollar invested in the market is financed with a short position in (i.e., borrowing at) the risk-free rate.
Fischer Black, "Beta and Return," Journal of Portfolio Management 20 (1993), pp. 8-18.

The persistent risk premiums associated with Fama-French factors suggest that they reflect a multifactor CAPM based on extra-market hedging demands rather than yet-unexplained anomalies, where firm characteristics are correlated with alpha values. We revisit this question in Chapter 13.

# Estimating and Implementing a Three-Factor SML

In Chapter 8, we estimated the single-index model for U.S. Steel. Now we are ready to estimate a three-factor model and see what it implies about the equilibrium expected rate of return on U.S. Steel stock. We begin by estimating U.S. Steel's beta on each of the Fama-French factors. Therefore, we generalize regression Equation 10.1 of the single-factor model and fit the following multiple regression equation, where we use U.S. Steel's ticker symbol,  $X$ , to denote the stock in Equation 10.10:

$$ r _ {X, t} - r _ {f, t} = \alpha_ {X} + \beta_ {M} \left(r _ {M, t} - r _ {f, t}\right) + \beta_ {\mathrm {H M L}} r _ {\mathrm {H M L}, t} + \beta_ {\mathrm {S M B}} r _ {\mathrm {S M B}, t} + e _ {X, t} \tag {10.10}
$$

The three betas on the right-hand side of Equation 10.10 measure U.S. Steel's sensitivities to the three hypothesized sources of systematic risk: the market index  $(M)$ , the value-versus-growth factor (HML), and the size factor (SMB).

Table 10.1 shows estimates of both the single-factor and three-factor index models. The intercept in each regression is the estimate of U.S. Steel's (monthly) alpha over the sample period. The coefficient on the market index excess return,  $r_{M} - r_{f}$ , is the estimate of U.S. Steel's market risk, while the coefficients on the returns of SMB and HML are estimates of its betas against the two extra-market risk factors.

U.S. Steel is only a moderately large firm. Its roughly \$5 billion market capitalization in early 2022 puts in somewhere between the 50th and 60th size percentile. On the other hand, its book-to-market ratio, about 1.5, is quite high, in the top decile. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, its beta against SMB is low and not even close to statistical significance, while its beta on HML is above 1 and easily significant. Given the significance of the extra-market factor, it is not surprising that the  $R$ -square in the three-factor model is greater than in the single-factor model, while the residual standard deviation is lower.

Estimates of single-index and three-factor Fama-French regressions for U.S. Steel, monthly data,

5 years ending in 2021.

Source:Authors' calculations.

Using the three-factor model to estimate expected returns requires forecasts of the premiums on the two extra-market risk premiums as well as that on the market index. The historical-average market risk premium has been about  $8.8\%$ , and those for SMB and HML have been  $3.0\%$  and  $4.2\%$ , respectively. Therefore, if the risk-free rate is  $2\%$ , we can calculate U.S. Steel's expected return using the estimates in Table 10.1 as follows.

$$
\begin{array}{l} E \left(r _ {X}\right) = r _ {f} + \beta_ {X, M} \left[ E \left(r _ {M}\right) - r _ {f} \right] + \beta_ {X, \mathrm {S M B}} E \left(r _ {\mathrm {S M B}}\right) + \beta_ {X, \mathrm {H M L}} E \left(r _ {\mathrm {H M L}}\right) \\ = 2 \% + (1.771 \times 8.8 \%) + (.369 \times 3.0 \%) + (1.249 \times 4.2 \%) = 23.9 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

If instead we use the beta estimate from the single-index model, we obtain a somewhat lower expected return:

$$
E \left(r _ {X}\right) = r _ {f} + \beta \left[ E \left(r _ {M}\right) - r _ {f} \right] = 2 \% + 2.030 \times 8.8 \% = 19.9 \%
$$

While U.S. Steel's beta against the market index is lower in the three-factor model, that lower sensitivity is more than offset by its exposure to the HML factor.

Notice that in neither case do we add the regression estimate of alpha to the forecast of expected return. Equilibrium expected returns depend only on risk; the expectation of alpha in market equilibrium must be zero. While a security may have outperformed its benchmark return in a particular sample period (as reflected in a positive alpha), we would not expect that performance to continue into the future. In fact, as an empirical matter, individual firm alphas show virtually no persistence over time.

# Extensions of the Three-Factor Model: A First Look

Since Fama and French published their three-factor model, there has been a crush of research looking for other factors that may explain the cross-section of average security returns. Here, we will provide only a first look at some of the more prominent candidates, deferring a closer look until a little later in the text.

But don't lose track of the more important general message of the APT. Once you understand a specific application such as the three-factor model, you can view all of its extensions as variants on an important theme: There are a limited number of factor portfolios, each of which proxies for a source of systematic risk. Given the exposures to these risks, or "factor betas," you can then examine the extent to which average returns vary with those exposures. This results in a multifactor security market line. This is exactly what we did for the three-factor model, and that methodology extends in a straightforward way to other multifactor models.

One of the earliest, and still most prominent, additions to the list of relevant factors was a momentum factor introduced by Carhart. His factor is the difference in the returns between stocks that performed well in the last year and those that performed poorly. The factor is often called UMD (for up minus down), analogously to SMB or HML. Persistence of recent relative performance captures a sort of momentum effect.

Fama and French offer an extension of their own model, which they call a five-factor pricing model. Their extension uses their original three factors augmented by a profitability factor and an investment factor. The profitability factor is commonly called RMW (for robust minus weak) and is the difference in returns on diversified stock portfolios with strong versus weak profitability. The investment factor is measured by CMA (conservative minus aggressive), the difference in returns on diversified portfolios comprising stocks of low-investment versus high-investment firms.

Notice that all of these factors are measured as the difference in returns of competing investment portfolios, for example, small versus large firms, and thus all may be interpreted as capturing a risk premium associated with some characteristic. Along these lines, you may have noticed as well that the market risk premium is also the difference in two security returns:  $r_{M} - r_{f}$  is the difference in returns between the market index and the risk-free asset.

The overwhelming number of new factors that have now appeared in the literature has been dubbed the factor zoo. Many of these may be redundant, simply minor variants on a common theme. Others may be spurious, the result of data snooping or "false positives" due to overly aggressive examination of historical returns. We will return to these issues in the next few chapters.

# Smart Betas and Multifactor Models

We've seen that both the CAPM and the APT have multifactor generalizations. There are at least two important implications of these generalizations. First, investors should be aware that their portfolios are subject to more than one systematic source of risk, and that they need to think about how much exposure they wish to establish to each systematic factor. Second, when they evaluate investment performance, they should be aware that risk premiums come from exposure to several risk factors and that alpha needs to be computed controlling for each of them.

A group of products called smart-beta ETFs has important implications for both of these issues. They are analogous to index ETFs, but instead of tracking a broad market index using market capitalization weights, they are funds designed to provide exposure to specific characteristics such as value, growth, or volatility. Among the more prominent themes are the extra-market factors of the Fama-French five-factor model: size (SMB), value (HML), operating profitability (RMW), and investment (CMA). Another common factor is momentum, which is the return on a portfolio that buys recent well-performing stocks and sells poorly performing ones. Other recently considered factors are based on volatility, as measured by the standard deviation of stock returns; liquidity; and dividend yield.

Smart-beta ETFs allow investors to tailor portfolio exposures either toward or away from a range of extra-market risk factors using easy-to-trade index-like products. They are therefore well-suited to a multifactor environment. They also raise the question of appropriate performance evaluation. When investors can cheaply and effectively manage exposure to multidimensional sources of systematic risk, investment success is captured by a multifactor alpha, providing a clean measure of the success of security selection. This is the message of the multifactor SML presented in Equation 7.13.

# SUMMARY

1. Multifactor models seek to improve the explanatory power of single-factor models by explicitly accounting for the various components of systematic risk. These models use indicators intended to capture a wide range of macroeconomic risk factors.
2. Once we allow for multiple risk factors, we conclude that the security market line also ought to be multidimensional, with exposure to each risk factor contributing to the total risk premium of the security.
3. A (risk-free) arbitrage opportunity arises when two or more security prices enable investors to construct a zero-net-investment portfolio that will yield a sure profit. The presence of arbitrage opportunities will generate a large volume of trades that puts pressure on security prices. This pressure will continue until prices reach levels that preclude such arbitrage.
4. When securities are priced so that there are no risk-free arbitrage opportunities, we say that they satisfy the no-arbitrage condition. Price relationships that satisfy the no-arbitrage condition are important because we expect them to hold in real-world markets.
5. Portfolios are called "well diversified" if they include a large number of securities and the investment proportion in each is sufficiently small. The proportion of any particular security in a well-diversified portfolio is small enough so that, for all practical purposes, a reasonable change in that security's rate of return will have a negligible effect on the portfolio's rate of return.
6. In a single-factor security market, all well-diversified portfolios have to satisfy the expected return-beta relationship of the CAPM to satisfy the no-arbitrage condition. If all well-diversified portfolios satisfy the expected return-beta relationship, then individual securities also must satisfy this relationship, at least approximately.
7. The APT does not require the restrictive assumptions of the CAPM and its (unobservable) market portfolio. The price of this generality is that the APT does not guarantee this relationship for all securities at all times.
8. A multifactor APT generalizes the single-factor model to accommodate several sources of systematic risk. The multidimensional security market line predicts that exposure to each risk factor contributes to the security's total risk premium by an amount equal to the security's factor beta times the risk premium of the factor portfolio that tracks that source of risk.
9. The multifactor extension of the single-factor CAPM, the ICAPM, predicts the same multidimensional security market line as the multifactor APT. The ICAPM suggests that priced extra-market risk factors will be the ones that lead to significant hedging demand by a substantial fraction of investors. Other approaches to the multifactor APT are more empirically based, where the extra-market factors are selected based on past ability to predict risk premiums.

1. Suppose that two factors have been identified for the U.S. economy: the growth rate of industrial production, IP, and the inflation rate, IR. IP is expected to be  $3\%$ , and IR  $5\%$ . A stock with a beta of 1 on IP and .5 on IR currently is expected to provide a rate of return of  $12\%$ . If industrial production actually grows by  $5\%$ , while the inflation rate turns out to be  $8\%$ , what is your revised estimate of the expected rate of return on the stock?
2. The APT itself does not provide guidance concerning the factors that one might expect to determine risk premiums. How should researchers decide which factors to investigate? Why, for example, is industrial production a reasonable factor to test for a risk premium?
3. If the APT is to be a useful theory, the number of systematic factors in the economy must be small. Why?
4. Suppose that there are two independent economic factors,  $F_{1}$  and  $F_{2}$ . The risk-free rate is  $6\%$ , and all stocks have independent firm-specific components with a standard deviation of  $45\%$ . Portfolios  $A$  and  $B$  are both well-diversified with the following properties:

Suppose that another portfolio, portfolio  $E$ , is well diversified with a beta of .6 and expected return of  $8\%$ . Would an arbitrage opportunity exist? If so, what would be the arbitrage strategy?

6. Assume that portfolios  $A$  and  $B$  are both well diversified and that  $E(r_{A}) = 12\%$  and  $E(r_{B}) = 9\%$ . If the economy has only one factor, and  $\beta_{A} = 1.2$ , whereas  $\beta_{B} = .8$ , what must be the risk-free rate?
7. Assume that stock market returns have the market index as a common factor, and that all stocks in the economy have a beta of 1 on the market index. Firm-specific returns all have a standard deviation of  $30\%$ .

Suppose that an analyst studies 20 stocks and finds that one-half of them have an alpha of  $+2\%$ , and the other half have an alpha of  $-2\%$ . Suppose the analyst invests \$1 million in an equally weighted portfolio of the positive alpha stocks, and shorts \$1 million of an equally weighted portfolio of the negative alpha stocks.

a. What are the expected profit (in dollars) and standard deviation of the analyst's profit?
b. How does your answer change if the analyst examines 50 stocks instead of 20 stocks? 100 stocks?

8. Assume that security returns are generated by the single-index model,

$$
R _ {i} = \alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {M} + e _ {i}
$$ where  $R_{i}$  is the excess return for security  $i$  and  $R_{M}$  is the market's excess return. The risk-free rate is  $2\%$ . Suppose also that there are three securities,  $A$ ,  $B$ , and  $C$ , characterized by the following data:

If one forms a well-diversified portfolio of type  $A$  securities, what will be the mean and variance of the portfolio's excess returns? What about portfolios composed only of type  $B$  or  $C$  stocks?
c. Is there an arbitrage opportunity in this market? What is it? Analyze the opportunity graphically.

9. The SML relationship states that the expected risk premium on a security in a one-factor model must be directly proportional to the security's beta. Suppose that this were not the case. For example, suppose that expected return rises more than proportionately with beta as in the figure below.

How could you construct an arbitrage portfolio? (Hint: Consider combinations of portfolios  $A$  and  $B$ , and compare the resultant portfolio to  $C$ .)

b. Some researchers have examined the relationship between average returns on diversified portfolios and the  $\beta$  and  $\beta^2$  of those portfolios. What should they have discovered about the effect of  $\beta^2$  on portfolio return?

10. Consider the following multifactor (APT) model of security returns for a particular stock.

<table><tr><td>Factor</td><td>Factor Beta</td><td>Factor Risk Premium</td></tr><tr><td>Inflation</td><td>1.2</td><td>6\%</td></tr><tr><td>Industrial production</td><td>0.5</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Oil prices</td><td>0.3</td><td>3</td></tr></table> a. If T-bills currently offer a  $6\%$  yield, find the expected rate of return on this stock if the market views the stock as fairly priced.

b. Suppose that the market expects the values for the three macro factors given in column 1 below, but that the actual values turn out as given in column 2. Calculate the revised expectations for the rate of return on the stock once the "surprises" become known.

<table><tr><td>Factor</td><td>Expected Value</td><td>Actual Value</td></tr><tr><td>Inflation</td><td>5\%</td><td>4\%</td></tr><tr><td>Industrial production</td><td>3</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Oil prices</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

11. Suppose that the market can be described by the following three sources of systematic risk with associated risk premiums.

<table><tr><td>Factor</td><td>Risk Premium</td></tr><tr><td>Industrial production (I)</td><td>6\%</td></tr><tr><td>Interest rates (R)</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Consumer confidence (C)</td><td>4</td></tr></table>

The return on a particular stock is generated according to the following equation:

$$ r = 15 \% + 1.0 I + .5 R + .75 C + e
$$

Find the equilibrium rate of return on this stock using the APT. The T-bill rate is  $6\%$ . Is the stock over- or underpriced? Explain.

12. As a finance intern at Pork Products, Jennifer Wainwright's assignment is to come up with fresh insights concerning the firm's cost of capital. She decides that this would be a good opportunity to try out the new material on the APT that she learned last semester. She decides that three promising factors would be (a) the return on a broad-based index such as the S&P 500; (b) the level of interest rates, as represented by the yield to maturity on 10-year Treasury bonds; and (c) the price of hogs, which is particularly important to her firm. Her plan is to find the beta of Pork Products against each of these factors by using a multiple regression and to estimate the risk premium associated with each exposure factor. Comment on Jennifer's choice of factors. Which are most promising with respect to the likely impact on her firm's cost of capital? Can you suggest improvements to her specification?

# Use the following information to answer Problems 13 through 16:

Orb Trust (Orb) has historically leaned toward a passive management style of its portfolios. The only model that Orb's senior management has promoted in the past is the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Now Orb's management has asked one of its analysts, Kevin McCracken, CFA, to investigate the use of the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) model.

McCracken believes that a two-factor APT model is adequate, where the factors are the sensitivity to changes in real GDP and changes in inflation. McCracken has concluded that the factor risk premium for real GDP is  $8\%$ , while the factor risk premium for inflation is  $2\%$ . He estimates for Orb's High Growth Fund that the sensitivities to these two factors are 1.25 and 1.5, respectively. Using his APT results, he computes the equilibrium expected return of the fund. For comparison purposes, he then uses fundamental analysis to compute the actually expected return of Orb's High Growth Fund. McCracken finds that the two estimates of the Orb High Growth Fund's expected return are equal.

McCracken asks a fellow analyst, Sue Kwon, to provide an estimate of the expected return of Orb's Large Cap Fund based on fundamental analysis. Kwon, who manages the fund, says that the expected return is  $8.5\%$  above the risk-free rate. McCracken then applies the APT model to the Large Cap Fund. He finds that the sensitivities to real GDP and inflation are .75 and 1.25, respectively.

McCracken's manager at Orb, Jay Stiles, asks McCracken to construct a portfolio that has a unit sensitivity to real GDP growth but is not affected by inflation. McCracken is confident in his APT estimates for the High Growth Fund and the Large Cap Fund. He then computes the sensitivities for a third fund, Orb's Utility Fund, which has sensitivities equal to 1.0 and 2.0, respectively. McCracken will use his APT results for these three funds to create a portfolio with a unit exposure to real GDP and no exposure to inflation. He calls the fund the "GDP Fund." Stiles says such a GDP Fund would be good for clients who are retirees who live off the steady income of their investments. McCracken does not agree with Stiles, but says that the fund would be a good choice if upcoming supply-side macroeconomic policies of the government are successful.


13. According to the APT, if the risk-free rate is  $4\%$ , what should be McCracken's estimate of the expected return of Orb's High Growth Fund?
14. With respect to McCracken's APT model estimate of Orb's Large Cap Fund and the information Kwon provides, is an arbitrage opportunity available?
15. If the GDP Fund is constructed from the other three funds, which of the following would be its weight in the Utility Fund? (a)  $-2.2$ ; (b)  $-3.2$ ; or (c) .3.
16. With respect to the comments of Stiles and McCracken concerning for whom the GDP Fund would be appropriate:

$a$  . McCracken is correct and Stiles is wrong.
$b$  Both are correct.
$c$ . Stiles is correct and McCracken is wrong.

17. Assume a universe of  $n$  (large) securities for which the largest residual variance is not larger than  $n\sigma_{M}^{2}$ . Construct as many different weighting schemes as you can that generate well-diversified portfolios.
18. Small firms generally have relatively high loadings (high betas) on the SMB (small minus big) factor.

$a$  .Explain why this is not surprising.
b. Now suppose two unrelated small firms merge. Each will be operated as an independent unit of the merged company. Would you expect the stock market behavior of the merged firm to differ from that of a portfolio of the two previously independent firms?
c. How does the merger affect market capitalization?
$d$ . What is the prediction of the Fama-French 3-factor model for the risk premium on the merged firm compared to the weighted average of the two component companies?
e. Do we see here a problem in applying the FF model?

1. Jeffrey Bruner, CFA, uses the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to help identify mispriced securities. A consultant suggests Bruner use arbitrage pricing theory (APT) instead. In comparing CAPM and APT, the consultant makes the following arguments:

$a$ . Both the CAPM and APT require a mean-variance efficient market portfolio.
$b$ . Neither the CAPM nor the APT assumes normally distributed security returns.
c. The CAPM assumes that one specific factor explains security returns but APT does not.

State whether each of the consultant's arguments is correct or incorrect. Indicate, for each incorrect argument, why the argument is incorrect.

2. Assume that both  $X$  and  $Y$  are well-diversified portfolios and the risk-free rate is  $8\%$ .

<table><tr><td>Portfolio</td><td>Expected Return</td><td>Beta</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>16\%</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>Y</td><td>12</td><td>0.25</td></tr></table>

In this situation you would conclude that portfolios  $X$  and  $Y$ : a. Are in equilibrium.

b. Offer an arbitrage opportunity.
$c$  .Are both underpriced.
$d$ . Are both fairly priced.

3. A zero-investment portfolio with a positive alpha could arise if:

$a$ . The expected return of the portfolio equals zero.
$b$ . The capital market line is tangent to the opportunity set.
c. The Law of One Price remains unviolated.
$d$ . A risk-free arbitrage opportunity exists.

4. According to the theory of arbitrage:

$a$ . High-beta stocks are consistently overpriced.
$b$ . Low-beta stocks are consistently overpriced.
c. Positive alpha investment opportunities will quickly disappear.
$d$ . Rational investors will pursue arbitrage opportunities consistent with their risk tolerance.

5. The general arbitrage pricing theory (APT) differs from the single-factor capital asset pricing model (CAPM) because it:

$a$  .Places more emphasis on market risk.
$b$ . Minimizes the importance of diversification.
c. Recognizes multiple unsystematic risk factors.
$d$ . Recognizes multiple systematic risk factors.

6. An investor takes as large a position as possible when an equilibrium price relationship is violated. This is an example of:

$a$ . A dominance argument.
$b$ . The mean-variance efficient frontier.
c. Arbitrage activity.
$d$ . The capital asset pricing model.

7. The feature of the general version of the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) that offers the greatest potential advantage over the simple CAPM is the: a. Identification of anticipated changes in production, inflation, and term structure of interest rates as key factors explaining the risk-return relationship.

$b$ . Superior measurement of the risk-free rate of return over historical time periods.
c. Variability of coefficients of sensitivity to the APT factors for a given asset over time.
$d$ . Use of several factors instead of a single market index to explain the risk-return relationship.

8. In contrast to the capital asset pricing model, arbitrage pricing theory:

$a$ . Requires that markets be in equilibrium.
$b$ . Uses risk premiums based on micro variables.
$c$ . Specifies the number and identifies specific factors that determine expected returns.
$d$ . Does not require the restrictive assumptions concerning the market portfolio.

# E-INVESTMENTS EXERCISES

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. The GDP beta is 1.2 and GDP growth is  $1\%$  better than previously expected. So you will increase your forecast for the stock return by  $1.2 \times 1\% = 1.2\%$ . The revised forecast is for an  $11.2\%$  return.
2.  $a$ . This portfolio is not well diversified. The weight on the first security does not decline as  $n$  increases. Regardless of how much diversification there is in the rest of the portfolio, you will not shed the firm-specific risk of this security.
b. This portfolio is well diversified. Even though some stocks have three times the weight of other stocks (1.5/n versus .5/n), the weight on all stocks approaches zero as  $n$  increases. The impact of any individual stock's firm-specific risk will approach zero as  $n$  becomes ever larger.
3. The equilibrium return is  $E(r) = r_{f} + \beta_{P1}[E(r_{1}) - r_{f}] + \beta_{P2}[E(r_{2}) - r_{f}]$ . Using the data in Example 10.3:

$$
E (r) = 4 + . 2 \times (10 - 4) + 1. 4 \times (12 - 4) = 16.4 \%
$$

# The Efficient Market Hypothesis

# 11

ONE OF THE early applications of computers in economics in the 1950s was to analyze economic time series. Business cycle theorists felt that tracing the evolution of several economic variables over time would clarify and predict the progress of the economy through boom-and-bust periods. A natural candidate for analysis was the behavior of stock market prices over time. Assuming that stock prices reflect the prospects of the firm, recurrent patterns of peaks and troughs in economic performance ought to show up in those prices.

Maurice Kendall examined this proposition in 1953. He found to his great surprise that he could identify no predictable patterns in stock prices. Prices seemed to evolve randomly, apparently as likely to go up as go down on any particular day, regardless of past performance.

At first blush, Kendall's results were disturbing to some financial economists. They seemed to imply that the stock market is dominated by erratic market psychology, or "animal spirits"—that it follows no logical rules. In short, the results appeared to confirm the irrationality of the market. On further reflection, however, economists came to reverse their interpretation of Kendall's study.

It soon became apparent that random price movements indicated a well-functioning or efficient market, not an irrational one. In this chapter we explore the reasoning behind what may seem a surprising conclusion. We show how competition among analysts leads naturally to market efficiency, and we examine the implications of the efficient market hypothesis for investment policy. We also consider empirical evidence that supports and contradicts the notion of market efficiency.

# 11.1 Random Walks and Efficient Markets

Suppose Kendall had discovered that stock price changes are predictable. What a gold mine this would have been. Investors who could predict stock prices would reap unending profits simply by purchasing stocks that the computer model implied were about to increase in price and selling those stocks about to fall.

A moment's reflection should be enough to convince yourself that this situation could not persist for long. For example, suppose that the model predicts with great confidence that XYZ's stock price, currently at  \$100 per share, will rise dramatically in three days to\$ 110. What would all investors with access to the model's prediction do today? Obviously, they would place a great wave of buy orders to cash in on the imminent increase in stock price. No one holding XYZ, however, would be willing to sell. The net effect would therefore be an immediate jump in the stock price to 110 as the market digests and reflects the "good news" implicit in the model's forecast.

This simple example illustrates why Kendall's attempt to find recurrent patterns in stock price movements was likely to fail. A forecast about favorable future performance leads instead to favorable current performance, as market participants all try to get in on the action before the price jump.

More generally, one might say that any information that could be used to predict stock performance should already be reflected in stock prices. This point was made forcefully by Nobel laureate Eugene Fama in his pioneering exploration of market efficiency.2 As soon as there is any information indicating that a stock is underpriced, investors flock to buy the stock and immediately bid up its price to a fair level, where only ordinary rates of return can be expected. These "ordinary rates" are simply rates of return commensurate with the risk of the stock.

However, if prices are bid immediately to fair levels, given all available information, it must be that they increase or decrease only in response to new information. New information, by definition, must be unpredictable; if it could be predicted, then the prediction would be part of today's information. Thus, stock prices that change in response to new (i.e., previously unpredicted) information also must move unpredictably.

This is the essence of the argument that stock prices should follow a random walk, that is, that price changes should be random and unpredictable. Far from a proof of market irrationality, randomly evolving stock prices would be the necessary consequence of intelligent investors competing to discover relevant information on which to buy or sell stocks before the rest of the market becomes aware of that information.

Don't confuse randomness in price changes with irrationality in the level of prices. If prices are determined rationally, then only new information will cause them to change. Therefore, a random walk would be the natural result of prices that always reflect all current knowledge. Indeed, if stock price movements were predictable, that would be damning evidence of stock market inefficiency because the ability to predict prices would indicate that

${}^{2}$  Fama began this work in his doctoral dissertation in 1964. You can find a good review of his (and others') early contributions in Eugene F. Fama, "Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work," Journal of Finance 25 (1970), pp. 383-417.

3Actually, we are being a little loose with terminology here. Strictly speaking, we should characterize stock prices as following a submartingale, meaning that the expected change in the price can be positive, presumably as compensation for the time value of money and systematic risk. Moreover, the expected return may change over time as risk factors change. A random walk is more restrictive in that it constrains successive stock returns to be independent and identically distributed. Nevertheless, the term "random walk" is commonly used in the looser sense that price changes are essentially unpredictable. We will follow this convention.

all available information was not already reflected in stock prices. Therefore, the notion that stocks already reflect all available information is referred to as the efficient market hypothesis (EMH).

Figure 11.1 illustrates the response of stock prices to new information in an efficient market. The graph plots the price response of a sample of firms that were targets of takeover attempts. In most takeovers, the acquiring firm pays a substantial premium over current market prices. Therefore, an announcement of a takeover attempt should cause the stock price to jump. The figure shows that stock prices jump dramatically on the day the news becomes public. However, there is no further drift in prices after the announcement date, suggesting that prices reflect the new information, including the likely magnitude of the takeover premium, by the end of the trading day.

Even more dramatic evidence of rapid response to new information may be found in intraday prices. For example,

Patell and Wolfson show that most of the stock price response to corporate dividend or earnings announcements occurs within 10 minutes of the announcement. A nice illustration of such rapid adjustment is provided in a study by Busse and Green, who track minute-by-minute stock prices of firms that are featured on NBC's "Morning" or "Midday Call" segments. Minute 0 in Figure 11.2 is the time at which the stock is mentioned on the midday show. The top line is the average price movement of stocks that receive positive reports, while the bottom line reports returns on stocks with negative reports. Notice that the top line levels off, indicating that the market has fully digested the news within 5 minutes of the report. The bottom line levels off within about 12 minutes.

# Competition as the Source of Efficiency

Why should we expect stock prices to reflect "all available information"? After all, if you are willing to spend time and money on gathering information, it might seem reasonable that you could turn up something that has been overlooked by the rest of the investment community. When information is costly to uncover and analyze, one would expect investment analysis calling for such expenditures to result in an increased expected return.

Market efficiency should not be confused with the idea of efficient portfolios introduced in Chapter 7. An informationally efficient market is one in which information is rapidly disseminated and reflected in prices. An efficient portfolio is one with the highest expected return for a given level of risk.

This point has been stressed by Grossman and Stiglitz. They argue that investors will have an incentive to spend time and resources to analyze and uncover new information only if such activity is likely to generate higher investment returns. Thus, in market equilibrium, efficient information-gathering activity should be fruitful. Moreover, it would not be surprising to find that the degree of efficiency differs across various markets. For example, emerging markets that are less intensively analyzed than U.S. markets or in which accounting disclosure requirements are less rigorous may be less efficient than U.S. markets. Small stocks that receive relatively little coverage by Wall Street analysts may be less efficiently priced than large ones. Still, while we would not go so far as to say that you absolutely cannot come up with new insights, it makes sense to consider and respect your competition.

# Example 11.1 Rewards for Incremental Performance

Consider an investment management fund currently managing a  \$5 billion portfolio. Suppose that the fund manager can devise a research program that could increase the portfolio rate of return by one-tenth of 1\% per year, a seemingly modest amount. This program would increase the dollar return to the portfolio by\$ 5 billion × .001, or \$5 million. Therefore, the fund should be willing to spend up to \$5 million per year on that research. With such large rewards for even small increases in investment performance, it should not be surprising that professional portfolio managers are willing to spend large sums on industry analysts, technical support, and research effort. As a result, we should expect any obvious source of information to already be exploited.

Although it may not literally be true that "all" relevant information will be uncovered, it is likely that there are many investigators hot on the trail of most leads that seem likely to improve investment performance. Competition among these many well-backed, highly paid, aggressive analysts ensures that, as a general rule, stock prices ought to reflect available information regarding their proper levels.

Information is often said to be the most precious commodity on Wall Street, and the competition for it is intense. Consider the industry of so-called alternative data firms that has emerged to uncover and sell to large investors information that might shed light on

# Matchmakers for the Information Age

The most precious commodity on Wall Street is information, and informed players can charge handsomely for providing it. An industry of so-called expert network providers has emerged for selling access to experts with unique insights about a wide variety of firms and industries to investors who need that information to make decisions. These firms have been dubbed matchmakers for the information age.* Experts can range from doctors who help predict the release of blockbuster drugs to meteorologists who forecast weather that can affect commodity prices to business executives who can provide specialized insight about companies and industries.

The risk is that these experts may peddle inside information. For example, in 2011, a consultant for Primary Global Research was convicted of selling information to the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors.

Expert firms are supposed to provide only public information, along with the expert's insights and perspective. But the temptation to hire experts with inside information and charge handsomely for access to them is obvious. The SEC has raised concerns about the boundary between legitimate and illegal services.


In the wake of increased scrutiny, compliance efforts of both buyers and sellers of expert information have mushroomed. Expert firms now maintain detailed records of which experts have talked to whom, when those conversations took place, and what was discussed. These records can be released to authorities in the event of an insider trading investigation.

Even with these safeguards, however, there remains room for trouble. For example, an investor may meet an expert through a legitimate network and then the two may establish a consulting relationship on their own. This legal matchmaking becomes the precursor to the illegal selling of insider tips. Where there is a will to cheat, there usually will be a way.

*See, for example, "Expert Networks Are the Matchmakers for the Information Age," The Economist, June 16, 2011.

corporate prospects. For example, some firms use satellite imagery to estimate the number of cars parked outside big retailers such as Walmart, thereby getting a sense of daily sales. Other firms use satellite imagery to estimate the height of oil tanks and thus the size of oil stocks. One firm, Thanos, specializes in insights from cell phones. For example, in 2018, it tracked pings from cell phones at a Tesla factory and concluded that the overnight shift had increased by  $30\%$ . This was evidence of a soon-to-be-announced increase in production, news of which Thanos sold to its hedge fund clients. When the production increase was formally announced to the public, Tesla shares increased by  $9\%$ . Thanos reportedly will use similar techniques to track (and sell to clients) indicators of foot traffic at shopping malls.[8]

Sometimes the quest for a competitive advantage can tip over into a search for illegal inside information. For example, in 2011, Raj Rajaratnam, the head of the Galleon Group hedge fund, which once managed  \$6.5 billion, was convicted for soliciting tips from a network of corporate insiders and traders. In 2014, another successful hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, paid\$ 1.8 billion to settle an insider trading probe. While these firms clearly crossed the line separating legitimate and prohibited means to acquire information, that line is often murky. For example, a large industry of expert network firms connects (for a fee) investors to industry experts who can provide unique perspective on a company. As the nearby box discusses, this sort of arrangement can easily lead to insider trading and, in fact, was a key component of the case against SAC Capital.

# Versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis

It is common to distinguish among three versions of the EMH: the weak, semistrong, and strong forms of the hypothesis. They differ by their notions of what is meant by the term "all available information."

The weak-form hypothesis asserts that stock prices already reflect all information that can be derived by examining market trading data such as the history of past prices, trading volume, or short interest. This version implies that trend analysis is fruitless. Past stock price data are publicly available and virtually costless to obtain. The weak-form hypothesis holds that if such data ever conveyed reliable signals about future performance, all investors already would have learned to exploit them. Ultimately, the signals lose their value as they become widely known because a buy signal, for instance, would result in an immediate price increase.


The semistrong-form hypothesis states that all publicly available information regarding the prospects of a firm must be reflected already in the stock price. Such information includes, in addition to past trading data, fundamental data on the firm's product line, quality of management, balance sheet composition, patents held, earnings forecasts, and accounting practices. Again, if investors have access to such information from publicly available sources, one would expect it to be reflected in stock prices.

Finally, the strong-form version of the efficient market hypothesis states that stock prices reflect all relevant information, even including information available only to company insiders. This version of the hypothesis is quite extreme. Few would argue with the proposition that corporate officers have access to pertinent information long enough before public release to enable them to profit from trading on it. Indeed, much of the activity of the Securities and Exchange Commission is directed toward preventing insiders from profiting by exploiting their privileged position. Rule 10b-5 of the Security Exchange Act of 1934 sets limits on trading by corporate officers, directors, and substantial owners, requiring them to report trades to the SEC. These insiders, their relatives, and any associates who trade on information supplied by insiders are considered in violation of the law.

Defining insider trading is not always easy, however. After all, stock analysts are in the business of uncovering information not already widely known to market participants. As we saw in Chapter 3 as well as in the nearby box, the distinction between private and inside information is sometimes murky.

Notice one thing that all versions of the EMH have in common: They all assert that prices should reflect available information. We do not expect traders to be superhuman or market prices to always be right. We will always wish for more information about a company's prospects than will be available. Sometimes market prices will turn out in retrospect to have been outrageously high, at other times absurdly low. The EMH asserts only that at the given time, using current information, we cannot be sure if today's prices will ultimately prove themselves to have been too high or too low. If markets are rational, however, we can expect them to be correct on average.

# Concept Check 11.1 a. Suppose you observed that high-level managers make superior returns on investments in their company's stock. Would this be a violation of weak-form market efficiency? Would it be a violation of strong-form market efficiency?

b. If the weak-form version of the efficient market hypothesis is valid, must the strong-form version also hold? Conversely, does strong-form efficiency imply weak-form efficiency?

# 11.2 Implications of the EMH

# Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is essentially the search for recurrent and predictable patterns in stock prices. Although technicians recognize the value of information regarding future economic prospects of the firm, they believe that such information is not necessary for a successful trading strategy. This is because whatever the fundamental reason for a change in stock price, if the price responds slowly enough, the analyst will be able to identify a trend that can be exploited during the adjustment period. The key to successful technical analysis is a sluggish response of stock prices to fundamental supply-and-demand factors. This, of course, is diametrically opposed to the notion of an efficient market.


Technical analysts are sometimes called chartists because they study records or charts of past stock prices, hoping to find patterns they can exploit to make a profit. As an example of technical analysis, consider the relative strength approach. The chartist compares stock performance over a recent period to performance of the market or other stocks in the same industry. A simple version of relative strength takes the ratio of the stock price to a market indicator such as the S&P 500 index. If the ratio increases over time, the stock is said to exhibit relative strength because its price performance has been better than that of the broad market. Such strength presumably may continue for a long enough period of time to offer profit opportunities.

One of the most commonly heard components of technical analysis is the notion of resistance levels or support levels. These values are said to be price levels above which it is difficult for stock prices to rise, or below which it is unlikely for them to fall, and they are believed to be levels determined by market psychology.

# Example 11.2 Resistance Levels

Consider stock XYZ, which traded for several months at a price of  \$72 and then declined to\$ 65. If the stock price eventually begins to increase, \$72 will be considered a resistance level (according to this theory) because investors who bought originally at \$72 will be eager to sell their shares as soon as they can break even on their investment. Therefore, at prices near 72, a wave of selling pressure will exist. Such activity imparts a type of "memory" to the market that allows past price history to influence current prospects.

The efficient market hypothesis implies that technical analysis should be fruitless. The past history of prices and trading volume is publicly available at minimal cost. Therefore, any information that was ever available from analyzing past trading has already been reflected in stock prices. As investors compete to exploit their common knowledge of a stock's price history, they necessarily drive stock prices to levels where expected rates of return are exactly commensurate with risk. At those levels one cannot expect abnormal returns.

As an example of how this process works, consider what would happen if the market believed that a level of  \$72 truly was a resistance level in Example 11.2. No one would be willing to purchase the stock at a price of\$ 71.50 because it would have almost no room to increase in price, but ample room to fall. However, if no one would buy it at  \$71.50, then\$ 71.50 would become a resistance level. But then, using a similar analysis, no one would buy it at  \$71, or\$ 70, and so on. The notion of a resistance level poses a logical conundrum. Its simple resolution is the recognition that if the stock is ever to sell at \$71.50, investors must believe that the price can as easily increase as fall. The fact that investors are willing to purchase (or even hold) the stock at \$71.50 is evidence of their belief that they can earn a fair expected rate of return at that price.

# Concept Check 11.2

If everyone in the market believes in resistance levels, why don't these beliefs become self-fulfilling prophecies?

An interesting question is whether a trading strategy that seems to work will continue to work once it becomes widely recognized. A clever analyst may uncover a profitable trading rule; the real test of efficient markets is whether the rule itself becomes reflected in stock prices once its value is discovered. Once a useful technical rule is discovered, it ought to be invalidated when many traders attempt to exploit it. In this sense, price patterns ought to be self-destructing.

Thus, the market dynamic is one of a continual search for profitable trading rules, followed by destruction by overuse of those rules found to be successful, followed by more searching for yet-undiscovered rules. The following example illustrates this process.

# Example 11.3 Moneyball and the Efficient Market Hypothesis

In his famous book _Moneyball_, Michael Lewis explores an inefficient market—not a financial market but a sports market. He begins with the observation that baseball players at the turn of the century were systematically "mispriced" by team management and scouts, whose conventional wisdom about how best to evaluate players led them to ignore better gauges of "intrinsic value." Billy Beane, the manager of the Oakland Athletics, facing an extremely limited payroll compared to better-funded teams in the league, adopted _sabermetrics_ (statistical analysis applied to baseball) as a means to identify the best talent. He was forced to take what were then unconventional tactics to identify the players most undervalued by the league. _Sabermetrics_ was a resounding success: Despite a salary payroll of only \$44 million in 2002 (compared to more than \$125 million for the N.Y. Yankees!), Oakland made it to the playoffs, on the way setting an American League record with a 20-game win streak.

Beane took advantage of what appears to have been a grossly inefficient market, but the success of his innovations, not surprisingly, led to imitation. Part of the inefficiency in the sports market reflected a lack of relevant data about players; once that became clear, considerable resources were employed to gather more information and analyze it better. Other teams hired their own sabermetricians, player assessment across the league improved, and Oakland's analytical advantage dissipated. This feels a bit unfair to the innovators, but it is the inevitable dynamic of a market groping its way to greater efficiency. Competition among market participants ultimately forced market prices to better reflect players' intrinsic value. Useful information may occasionally be ignored or poorly used, but once a better means of analysis is devised, it is rarely long before it spreads widely.

# Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis uses earnings and dividend prospects of the firm, expectations of future interest rates, and risk evaluation of the firm to determine proper stock prices. Ultimately, it represents an attempt to determine the present value of all the payments a stockholder will receive from each share of stock. If that "intrinsic value" exceeds the stock price, the fundamental analyst would recommend purchasing the stock.

Fundamental analysts usually start with a study of past earnings and an examination of company balance sheets. They supplement this analysis with further detailed economic analysis, ordinarily including an evaluation of the quality of the firm's management, the firm's standing within its industry, and the prospects for the industry as a whole. The hope is to attain insight into future performance of the firm that is not yet recognized by the rest of the market. Chapters 17, 18, and 19 provide a detailed discussion of the types of analyses that underlie fundamental analysis.

Once again, the efficient market hypothesis predicts that most fundamental analysis also is doomed to failure. If analysts rely on publicly available earnings and industry information, their evaluation of a firm's prospects is not likely to be significantly more accurate than those of their rivals. Many well-informed, well-financed firms conduct such market research, and in the face of such competition it will be difficult to uncover data not also available to other firms. Only analysts with a unique insight will be rewarded.

Fundamental analysis is more difficult than merely identifying well-run firms with good prospects. Discovery of good firms does an investor no good in and of itself if the rest of the market also knows those firms are good. If the knowledge is already public, the investor will be forced to pay a high price for those firms and will not realize a superior rate of return.

The trick is not to identify firms that are good, but to find firms that are better than everyone else's estimate. Similarly, troubled firms can be great bargains if their prospects are not quite as bad as their stock prices suggest.

This is why fundamental analysis is difficult. It is not enough to do a good analysis of a firm; you can make money only if your analysis is better than that of your competitors because the market price will already reflect all commonly recognized information.

# Active versus Passive Portfolio Management

By now it is apparent that casual efforts to pick stocks are not likely to pay off. Competition among investors ensures that any easily implemented stock evaluation technique will be used widely enough so that any insights derived will be reflected in stock prices. Only serious analysis and uncommon techniques are likely to generate the differential insight necessary to yield trading profits.

Moreover, these techniques are feasible only for managers of large portfolios. If you have only  \$100,000 to invest, even a 1\%$  per year improvement in performance generates only 1,000 per year, hardly enough to justify herculean efforts. The billion-dollar manager, however, would reap extra income of \$10 million annually from the same  $1\%$  increment.

If small investors are at a disadvantage in active portfolio management, what are their choices? They probably are better off investing in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. By pooling resources in this way, they can gain from economies of scale.

More difficult decisions remain, though. Can investors be sure that even large funds have the ability or resources to uncover mispriced stocks? Furthermore, will any mispricing be sufficiently large to repay the costs entailed in active portfolio management?

Proponents of the efficient market hypothesis believe that active management is largely wasted effort and unlikely to justify the expenses incurred. Therefore, they advocate a passive investment strategy that makes no attempt to outsmart the market. A passive strategy aims only at establishing a well-diversified portfolio of securities without attempting to find under- or overvalued stocks. Passive management is usually characterized by a buy-and-hold strategy. When stock prices are at fair levels, it makes no sense to buy and sell frequently, which generates large trading costs without increasing expected performance.

One common strategy for passive management is to create an index fund, which is a portfolio designed to replicate the performance of a broad-based index of stocks. For example, Vanguard's 500 Index Fund holds stocks in direct proportion to their weight in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock price index, and its Total Stock Market Index Fund holds an even broader portfolio that replicates the CRSP index of virtually all actively traded U.S. stocks.[10]

Investors in these funds obtain broad diversification with low management fees. The fees can be kept to a minimum because Vanguard does not need to pay analysts to assess stock prospects and does not incur transaction costs from high portfolio turnover. Indeed, while the typical annual charge for an actively managed equity fund is almost  $1\%$  of assets, the expense ratio of these two funds is only  $0.4\%$ . Vanguard's Total Stock Market fund is a behemoth, with assets under management in early 2022 of approximately \$1.4 trillion. The 500 Index Fund has another \$850 billion under management.

Indexing need not be limited to major U.S. stock indexes, however. For example, some of the funds offered by the Vanguard Group track the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, the CRSP index of small-capitalization U.S. companies, and the Financial Times indexes of the European and Pacific Basin equity markets. Several other mutual fund complexes offer indexed portfolios, but Vanguard dominates the retail market for indexed mutual funds.

Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are a close (and often lower-expense) alternative to indexed mutual funds. As described in Chapter 4, these are shares in diversified portfolios that can be bought or sold just like shares of individual stock. ETFs matching several broad stock market indexes such as the S&P 500 or CRSP indexes and dozens of international and industry stock indexes are available to investors who want to hold a diversified sector of a market without attempting active security selection. Over 5 trillion is invested in ETFs, most of which is indexed.

# Concept Check 11.3

What would happen to market efficiency if all investors attempted to follow a passive strategy?

# The Role of Portfolio Management in an Efficient Market

If the market is efficient, why not pick stocks by throwing darts at The Wall Street Journal instead of trying rationally to choose a stock portfolio? This is a tempting conclusion to draw from the notion that security prices are fairly set, but it is far too facile. There is a role for rational portfolio management, even in perfectly efficient markets.

You have learned that a basic principle in portfolio selection is diversification. Even if all stocks are priced fairly, each still poses firm-specific risk that can be eliminated through diversification. Therefore, rational security selection, even in an efficient market, calls for the construction of an efficiently diversified portfolio providing the systematic risk level that the investor wants.

Rational investment policy also requires that tax considerations be reflected in security choice. High-tax-bracket investors generally will not want the same securities as low-bracket ones. At an obvious level, high-bracket investors find it advantageous to buy tax-exempt municipal bonds despite their relatively low pretax yields, whereas those same bonds are unattractive to low-tax-bracket or tax-exempt investors. At a more subtle level, high-bracket investors might want to tilt their portfolios in the direction of capital gains as opposed to interest income because capital gains are taxed less heavily and because the option to defer the realization of capital gains income is more valuable than the higher the current tax bracket. They also will be more attracted to investment opportunities for which returns are sensitive to tax benefits, such as real estate ventures.

A third argument for rational portfolio management relates to the particular risk profile of the investor. For example, a Toyota executive whose annual bonus depends on Toyota's profits generally should not invest additional amounts in auto stocks. To the extent that the executive's compensation already depends on Toyota's well-being, that individual is already overinvested in Toyota and should not exacerbate the lack of diversification.

This lesson was learned with considerable pain in September 2008 by Lehman Brothers employees who were famously invested in their own firm when the company failed. Roughly  $30\%$  of the shares in the firm were owned by its 24,000 employees, and their losses on those shares totaled around 10 billion.

Investors of varying ages also might prefer different portfolio policies. For example, older investors who are essentially living off savings might choose to avoid large equity investments, where market values fluctuate dramatically. Because these investors are living off accumulated savings, they require conservation of principal. In contrast, younger investors might be more inclined toward long-term inflation-indexed bonds. The steady flow of real income over long periods of time that is locked in with these bonds can be more important than preservation of principal to those with long life expectancies.

In conclusion, there is a role for portfolio management even in an efficient market. Investors' optimal positions will vary according to factors such as age, tax bracket, risk aversion, and employment. The role of the portfolio manager in an efficient market is to tailor the portfolio to these needs, rather than to beat the market.

# Resource Allocation

We've focused so far on the investment implications of the efficient market hypothesis. Deviations from efficiency may offer profit opportunities to better-informed traders at the expense of less-informed ones.

However, deviations from informational efficiency would also result in a large cost that would be borne by all citizens, namely, inefficient resource allocation. Recall that in a capitalist economy, investments in real assets such as plant, equipment, and know-how are guided in large part by the prices of financial assets. For example, if the value of telecommunication capacity reflected in stock market prices exceeds the cost of installing such capacity, managers might justifiably conclude that telecom investments seem to have positive net present value. In this manner, capital market prices guide allocation of real resources.

If markets were inefficient and securities commonly mispriced, then resources would be systematically misallocated. Corporations with overpriced securities would be able to obtain capital too cheaply, and corporations with undervalued securities might forgo investment opportunities because the cost of raising capital would be too high. Therefore, inefficient capital markets would diminish one of the most potent benefits of a market economy. As an example of what can go wrong, consider the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, which sent a strong but, as it turned out, wildly overoptimistic signal about the immediate prospects for Internet and telecommunication firms and ultimately led to substantial overinvestment in those industries.

Before writing off markets as a means to guide resource allocation, however, one has to be reasonable about what can be expected from market forecasts. In particular, you shouldn't confuse an efficient market, where all available information is reflected in prices, with a perfect-foresight market. As we said earlier, "all available information" is still far from complete information, and generally rational market forecasts will sometimes be wrong; sometimes, in fact, they will be very wrong.

# 11.3 Event Studies

If security prices reflect all currently available information, then price changes must reflect new developments. This allows us to back out the economic impact of those events.

An event study is a technique used to assess the impact of a particular event on a firm's stock price. An analyst might want to study the impact of dividend changes on stock prices, for example. An event study would quantify the relationship between dividend changes and stock returns.


Analyzing the impact of any particular event is more difficult than it might at first appear. On any day, stock prices respond to a wide range of economic news such as updated forecasts for GDP, inflation rates, interest rates, or corporate profitability. Isolating the part of a stock price movement that is attributable to a specific event is not trivial.

The general approach starts with a proxy for what the stock return would have been in the absence of the event. The abnormal return is the difference between the actual return and this benchmark. Several methodologies for estimating the benchmark return may be used. For example, a very simple approach measures abnormal return as the stock's return minus that of a broad market index. An obvious refinement is to compare the return to those of other stocks matched according to criteria such as firm size, beta, recent performance, or ratio of price to book value per share. Another approach estimates normal returns using an asset pricing model such as the CAPM or one of its generalizations such as the Fama-French multifactor models.

To illustrate, we use a "market model" to estimate abnormal returns. This approach is based on the index models we introduced in Chapter 9. Recall that a single-index model holds that stock returns are determined by a market factor and a firm-specific factor. The stock return,  $r_{b}$ , during a given period  $t$ , would be

$$ r _ {t} = a + b r _ {M t} + e _ {t} \tag {11.1}
$$ where  $r_{Mt}$  is the market's rate of return during the period and  $e_t$  is the part of a security's return resulting from firm-specific events. The parameter  $b$  measures sensitivity to the market return, and  $a$  is the average rate of return the stock would realize in a period with a zero market return.[11] Equation 11.1 therefore provides a decomposition of  $r_t$  into market and firm-specific factors. The firm-specific or abnormal return may be interpreted as the unexpected return that results from the event.


We can rewrite Equation 11.1 to isolate the abnormal return in any period:

$$ e _ {t} = r _ {t} - \left(a + b r _ {M t}\right) \tag {11.2}
$$

Equation 11.2 has a simple interpretation: The residual,  $e_{t}$ , is the stock's return over and above what one would predict based on broad market movements in that period, given the stock's sensitivity to the market.

# Example 11.4 Abnormal Returns

Suppose that the analyst has estimated that  $a = .05\%$  and  $b = .8$ . On a day that the market goes up by  $1\%$ , you would predict from Equation 11.1 that the stock should rise by an expected value of  $.05\% + .8 \times 1\% = .85\%$ . If the stock actually rises by  $2\%$ , the analyst would infer that firm-specific news that day caused an additional stock return of  $2\% - .85\% = 1.15\%$ . This is the abnormal return for the day.

The market model is highly flexible because it can be generalized to include richer models of benchmark returns, for example, by including industry as well as broad market returns on the right-hand side of Equation 11.1, or returns on indexes constructed to match characteristics such as firm size. However, one must be careful that regression parameters in Equation 11.1 (the intercept  $a$  and slope  $b$ ) are estimated properly. In particular, they must be estimated using data sufficiently separated in time from the event in question that they are not affected by event-period abnormal stock performance. In part because of this vulnerability, returns on characteristic-matched portfolios are more widely used.

One concern that complicates event studies arises from leakage of information. Leakage occurs when information regarding a relevant event is released to a small group of investors before official public release. In this case the stock price might start to increase (in the case of a "good news" announcement) days or weeks before the official announcement date. Any abnormal return on the announcement date is then a poor indicator of the total impact of the information release. A better indicator would be the cumulative abnormal return (CAR), which is simply the sum of all abnormal returns over the time period of interest. The cumulative abnormal return thus captures the total firm-specific stock movement for the entire period that the market might be responding to new information.

Figure 11.1 (earlier in the chapter) presents the results from a fairly typical event study. In most takeovers, stockholders of the acquired firms sell their shares to the acquirer at substantial premiums over market value. Announcement of a takeover attempt is good news for shareholders of the target firm and therefore should cause stock prices to jump.

Figure 11.1 confirms the good-news nature of the announcements. On the announcement day, called day 0, the average CAR for the sample of takeover candidates increases substantially, indicating a large and positive abnormal return on the announcement date. Notice that immediately after the announcement date the CAR no longer increases or decreases significantly. This is exactly what the efficient market hypothesis would predict. Once the new information became public, the stock prices jumped almost immediately in response to the good news. With prices once again fairly set, reflecting the effect of the new information, further abnormal returns on any particular day are equally likely to be positive or negative. In fact, for a sample of many firms, the average abnormal return should be extremely close to zero, and thus the CAR will show neither upward nor downward drift. This is precisely the pattern shown in Figure 11.1.

The pattern of returns for the days preceding the public announcement date yields some interesting evidence about efficient markets and information leakage. If insider trading rules were perfectly obeyed and perfectly enforced, stock prices would show no abnormal returns on days before the public release of relevant news because no special firm-specific information would be available to the market before public announcement. We would observe a clean jump in the stock price only on the announcement day. In fact, Figure 11.1 shows that the prices of the takeover targets clearly start an upward drift 30 days before the public announcement. It appears that information is leaking to some market participants. Such evidence of leakage appears almost universally in event studies, suggesting at least some abuse of insider trading rules.

Nevertheless, the SEC also can take some comfort from patterns such as that in Figure 11.1. If insider trading rules were widely and flagrantly violated, we would expect to see abnormal returns earlier than they appear in these results. For example, in the case of mergers, the CAR would turn positive as soon as acquiring firms decided on their takeover targets because insiders would start trading immediately. By the time of the public announcement, the insiders would have bid up the stock prices of target firms to levels reflecting the merger attempt, and the abnormal returns on the actual public announcement date would be close to zero. The dramatic increase in the CAR on the announcement date indicates that a good deal of these announcements are indeed news to the market and that stock prices do not already reflect complete knowledge about the takeovers. It would appear, therefore, that SEC enforcement does have a substantial effect on restricting insider trading, even if some still persists.


Event study methodology has become a widely accepted tool to measure the economic impact of a wide range of events. For example, the SEC regularly uses event studies to measure illicit gains captured by traders who may have violated insider trading or other securities laws.[12] Event studies are also used in fraud cases, where the courts must assess damages caused by a fraudulent activity.

# Example 11.5 Using Abnormal Returns to Infer Damages

Suppose the stock of a company with market value of 100 million falls by 4 \%on the day that news of an accounting scandal surfaces. The rest of the market, however, generally does well that day. The market indexes are up sharply and, on the basis of the usual relationship between the stock and the market, one would have expected a 2 \%gain on the stock. We would conclude that the impact of the scandal was a 6 \%drop in value, the difference between the 2 \%gain that we would have expected and the 4 \%drop actually observed. One might then infer that the damages sustained from the scandal were \$ 6million because the value of the firm (after adjusting for general market movements) fell by 6 \%of \$ 100million when investors became aware of the news and reassessed the value of the stock.

Suppose that we see negative abnormal returns (declining CARs) after an announcement date. Is this a violation of efficient markets?

# 11.4 Are Markets Efficient?

# The Issues

Not surprisingly, the efficient market hypothesis does not exactly elicit enthusiasm in the community of professional portfolio managers. It implies that a great deal of the activity of these managers—the search for undervalued securities—is at best wasted effort, and quite probably harmful to clients because it costs money and leads to imperfectly diversified portfolios. Consequently, the EMH has never been widely accepted on Wall Street, and debate continues today on the degree to which security analysis can improve investment performance. However, the following issues imply that the debate probably never will be settled: the magnitude issue, the selection bias issue, and the lucky event issue.

The Magnitude Issue We noted that an investment manager overseeing a \$5 billion portfolio who can improve performance by only .1\% per year will increase investment earnings by  $0.01 \times \$ 5 billion = \ $5 million annually. This manager clearly would be worth the salary received! Yet can we, as observers, statistically measure that manager's contribution? Probably not: A .1 \%$  annual contribution would be swamped by the volatility of the market. Remember, since 1926 the annual standard deviation of the highly diversified S&P 500 index has been almost  $20 \%$  . Against these fluctuations, a small increase in performance would be hard to detect.


All might agree that stock prices are very close to fair values and that only managers of large portfolios can earn enough trading profits to make the exploitation of minor mispricing worth the effort. According to this view, the actions of intelligent investment managers are the driving force behind the constant evolution of market prices to fair levels. Rather than ask the qualitative question, Are markets efficient?, we should instead ask a more quantitative question: How efficient are markets?

The Selection Bias Issue Suppose you discover an investment scheme that could really make money. You have two choices: either publish your technique in The Wall Street Journal to win fleeting fame or keep your technique secret and use it to earn millions of dollars. Most investors would choose the latter option, which presents us with a problem. Only investors who find that an investment scheme cannot generate abnormal returns will be willing to report their findings to the whole world. Hence, skeptics of efficient markets always can disregard evidence that various techniques do not provide investment rewards and argue that the techniques that do work simply are not being reported. This is a problem in selection bias; the outcomes we are able to observe have been preselected in favor of failed attempts.

The Lucky Event Issue In virtually any month it seems we hear about some investor or investment company with fantastic investment performance. Surely these examples disprove the efficient market hypothesis.

Yet this conclusion is far from obvious. As an analogy to the investment game, consider a contest to flip the most number of heads out of 50 trials using a fair coin. The expected outcome for any person is, of course,  $50\%$  heads and  $50\%$  tails. If 10,000 people, however, compete in this contest, it would not be surprising if at least one or two of them flipped more than  $75\%$  heads. In fact, elementary statistics tells us that the expected number of contestants flipping  $75\%$  or more heads would be two. It would be silly, though, to crown these people the "head-flipping champions of the world." Obviously, they are simply the ones who happened to get lucky on the day of the event. (See the nearby box.)

The analogy to efficient markets is clear. If securities are fairly priced given all available information, any bet on a stock is simply a coin toss with an equal likelihood of winning or losing. However, if many investors using a variety of schemes make fair bets, statistically speaking, some of them will be lucky and win a great majority of the bets. For every big winner, there may be many big losers, but we never hear of them. The winners, though, turn up in *The Wall Street Journal* as the latest stock market gurus; then they can make a fortune publishing market newsletters.

Our point is that after the fact there will have been at least one successful investment scheme. A doubter will call the results luck; the successful investor will call it skill. The proper test would be to see whether the successful investors can repeat their performance in another period, yet this approach is rarely taken.

With these caveats in mind, we turn now to some of the empirical tests of the efficient market hypothesis.

Suppose you want to make your fortune publishing a market newsletter. You first need to convince potential subscribers that you have talent worth paying for. But what if you have no talent? The solution is simple: Start eight newsletters.

In year 1, let four of your newsletters predict an up-market and four a down-market. In year 2, let half of the originally optimistic group of newsletters continue to predict an up-market and the other half a down-market. Do the same for the originally pessimistic group. Continue in this manner to obtain the pattern of predictions in the table that follows ( $U =$  prediction of an up-market,  $D =$  prediction of a down-market).

After three years, one of the newsletters would have had a perfect prediction record. This is because after three years there are  $2^{3} = 8$  possible outcomes for the market, and we have covered all eight possibilities with the eight newsletters. Now, we simply slough off the seven unsuccessful newsletters and market the eighth newsletter based on its perfect track record. If we want to establish a newsletter with a perfect track record over a four-year period, we need  $2^{4} = 16$  newsletters. A five-year period requires 32 newsletters, and so on.

After the fact, the one newsletter that was always right will attract attention for your uncanny foresight and investors will rush to pay large fees for its advice. Your fortune is made, and you have never even researched the market!

WARNING: This scheme is illegal! The point, however, is that with hundreds of market newsletters, you can find one that has stumbled onto an apparently remarkable string of successful predictions without any real degree of skill. After the fact, someone's prediction history can seem to imply great forecasting skill. This person is the one we will read about in *The Wall Street Journal*; the others will be forgotten.

# Concept Check 11.5

Legg Mason's Value Trust, managed by Bill Miller, outperformed the S&P 500 in each of the 15 years ending in 2005. Is Miller's performance sufficient to dissuade you from a belief in efficient markets? If not, would any performance record be sufficient to dissuade you? Now consider that in the next three years, the fund dramatically underperformed the S&P 500; by the end of 2008, its cumulative 18-year performance was barely different from the index. Does this affect your opinion?

# Weak-Form Tests: Patterns in Stock Returns

Returns over Short Horizons Early tests of efficient markets were tests of the weak form. Could speculators find trends in past prices that would enable them to earn abnormal profits? This is essentially a test of the efficacy of technical analysis.

One way of discerning trends in stock prices is by measuring the serial correlation of stock market returns. Serial correlation refers to the tendency for stock returns to be related to past returns. Positive serial correlation means that positive returns tend to follow positive returns (a momentum type of property). Negative serial correlation means that positive returns tend to be followed by negative returns (a reversal or "correction" property). Both Conrad and Kaul and Lo and MacKinlay examine weekly returns of NYSE stocks and find positive serial correlation over short horizons. However, the correlation coefficients of weekly returns tend to be fairly small, at least for large stocks for which price data are the most reliably up-to-date. Thus, while these studies demonstrate weak price trends over short periods, $^{15}$  the evidence does not clearly suggest the existence of trading opportunities.


While broad market indexes demonstrate only weak serial correlation at short horizons, for example, a month or so, there appears to be stronger momentum at longer horizons. In an investigation of intermediate-horizon stock price behavior (using 3- to 12-month holding periods), Jegadeesh and Titman found a momentum effect in which good or bad recent performance of particular stocks continues over time. They conclude that while the performance of individual stocks is highly unpredictable, portfolios of the best-performing stocks in the recent past appear to outperform other stocks with enough reliability to offer profit opportunities.

Returns over Long Horizons Although studies of short- to intermediate-horizon returns suggest some momentum in stock market prices, tests of long-horizon returns (i.e., returns over multiyear periods) have found suggestions of pronounced negative long-term serial correlation in the performance of the aggregate market.[17] The latter result has given rise to a "fads hypothesis," which asserts that the stock market might overreact to relevant news. Such overreaction leads to positive serial correlation (momentum) over short time horizons. Subsequent correction of the overreaction leads to longer-term poor performance following good performance and vice versa.

Nobel laureate Robert Shiller points out that overreaction followed by correction would cause prices to fluctuate around fair value and make asset prices excessively volatile compared to the volatility in intrinsic value.[18] He presents Figure 11.3 to illustrate his point. The jagged lines show the actual level of the S&P index going back to 1871. The two smoother lines show the present value of all dividends paid by the S&P portfolio from a given start date through 2013 plus the present value of a terminal payoff in 2013 computed from a constant-growth dividend discount model (with two assumptions for that steady-state growth rate). This is an estimate of the fundamental value of the index. Shiller points out that the actual price line oscillates around either estimate of fundamental value, consistent with a fads hypothesis in which prices overshoot the fundamental mark in both bull and bear markets before ultimately correcting.

One might think that overshooting followed by reversion to "fair" value would create price predictability that conventional random walk tests would have detected. But Shiller argues that the common finding that asset price changes are largely unpredictable does not disprove his hypothesis. If pricing errors are persistent (more specifically, if they dissipate only slowly), then price changes at short time horizons will be largely unpredictable even if price levels do not equal intrinsic value. Corrections would be discernible only at longer horizons. This analysis is consistent with the short-term momentum and longer-term price reversion that we have seen in the historical record.

On the other hand, there is evidence that share prices of individual securities (as opposed to broad market indexes) are more prone to reversals than continuations at very short horizons. See, for example, B. Lehmann, "Fads, Martingales and Market Efficiency," Quarterly Journal of Economics 105 (February 1990), pp. 1-28; and N. Jegadeesh, "Evidence of Predictable Behavior of Security Returns," Journal of Finance 45 (September 1990), pp. 881-98. However, as Lehmann notes, this is probably best interpreted as due to liquidity problems after big movements in stock prices as market makers adjust their positions in the stock.

These long-horizon results are dramatic but still not conclusive. An alternative interpretation holds that they indicate only that the market risk premium varies over time. For example, when the risk premium and the required return on the market rise, stock prices will fall. When the market then rises (on average) at this higher rate of return, the data convey the impression of a stock price recovery. In this view, the apparent overshooting and correction are in fact no more than a rational response of market prices to changes in discount rates. Shiller contends that even allowing for variation in risk premia does not eliminate the overshooting phenomenon, but it is probably fair to say that the jury is still out on this controversy.

In addition to studies suggestive of overreaction in overall stock market returns over long horizons, many other studies suggest that extreme performance in particular securities also tends to reverse itself: DeBondt and Thaler $^{19}$  and Chopra, Lokonishok, and Ritter $^{20}$  conclude that the stocks that have performed best in the recent past seem to underperform the rest of the market in following periods, while the worst past performers tend to offer above-average future performance.

For example, the DeBondt and Thaler study found that if one were to rank the performance of stocks over a five-year period and then group stocks into portfolios based on investment performance, the base-period "loser" portfolio (defined as the 35 stocks with the worst investment performance) outperformed the "winner" portfolio (the top

35 stocks) by an average of  $25\%$  (cumulative return) in the following three-year period. This reversal effect, in which losers rebound and winners fade back, suggests that the stock market overreacts to relevant news. After the overreaction is recognized, extreme investment performance is reversed. This phenomenon would imply that a contrarian investment strategy—investing in recent losers and avoiding recent winners—should be profitable. Moreover, these returns seem pronounced enough to be exploited profitably.

Thus, it appears that there may be short-run momentum but long-run reversal patterns in price behavior both for the market as a whole and across sectors of the market. One interpretation of this pattern is that short-run overreaction (reflected in price momentum) may lead to long-term reversals (when the market recognizes its past error).

# Predictors of Broad Market Returns

Several studies have documented the ability of easily observed variables to predict market returns. For example, Fama and French $^{21}$  showed that the return on the aggregate stock market tends to be higher when the dividend/price ratio, the dividend yield, is high. Campbell and Shiller $^{22}$  found that the earnings yield can predict market returns. Keim and Stambaugh $^{23}$  showed that bond market data such as the spread between yields on high- and low-grade corporate bonds also help predict broad market returns.

Again, the interpretation of these results is difficult. On the one hand, they may imply that abnormal stock returns can be predicted, in violation of the efficient market hypothesis. More probably, however, these variables are proxying for variation in the market risk premium. For example, given a forecast of dividends or earnings, stock prices will be lower and dividend and earnings yields will be higher when the risk premium (and therefore the expected market return) is higher. Thus, a high dividend or earnings yield will be associated with higher market returns. But rather than a violation of market efficiency, the predictability of market returns is due to predictability in the risk premium.

Fama and French $^{24}$  showed that the yield spread between high- and low-grade bonds has greater predictive power for returns on low-grade bonds than high-grade bonds, and greater predictive power for stock rather than bond returns, suggesting that the predictability in returns is in fact a risk premium rather than evidence of market inefficiency. Similarly, the fact that the dividend yield on stocks helps to predict bond market returns suggests that the yield captures a risk premium common to both markets rather than mispricing in the equity market.

# Semistrong Tests: Market Anomalies

Fundamental analysis uses a much wider range of information to create portfolios than does technical analysis. Tests of fundamental analysis ask whether publicly available information beyond trading history can be used to improve investment performance; as such, they are tests of semistrong-form market efficiency. Surprisingly, several easily accessible statistics, for example, a stock's market capitalization, seem to predict abnormal risk-adjusted returns. Findings such as these, which we will review in the following

pages, are difficult to reconcile with the efficient market hypothesis and therefore are often referred to as efficient market anomalies.

A difficulty in interpreting these tests is that we usually need to adjust for portfolio risk before evaluating the success of an investment strategy. For example, suppose we use the CAPM to adjust for risk. We know that even if beta is a relevant descriptor of stock risk, the empirically measured quantitative trade-off between risk as measured by beta and expected return differs from the predictions of the CAPM. (We review this evidence in Chapter 13.) If we use the CAPM to risk-adjust portfolio returns, incorrect adjustments may lead to the conclusion that various portfolio strategies can generate superior returns, when, in fact, the risk adjustment procedure has simply failed.

Another way to put this is to note that tests of risk-adjusted returns are joint tests of the efficient market hypothesis and the model of expected returns. If we find strategies that appear to offer abnormal returns, it could mean simply that our benchmarks are wrong.

Consider, for example, a P/E effect reported by Basu,[25] who concluded that low price-earnings (P/E) ratio stocks appeared to offer better risk-adjusted returns than high P/E ones. Would this conclusion indicate that the market systematically misprices stocks according to P/E ratio? This would be an extremely surprising and, to us, disturbing conclusion because P/E ratios are so simple to observe. Although it may be possible to earn superior returns through unusual insight, it hardly seems plausible that such a simplistic technique is enough to generate abnormal returns.

An alternative interpretation is that returns have not been not properly adjusted for risk. If two firms have the same expected earnings, the riskier stock will sell at a lower price and lower P/E ratio. Because of its higher risk, the low P/E stock also will have higher expected returns. Therefore, unless the model of expected return properly adjusts for risk, P/E will be a useful additional proxy for risk and will appear to predict abnormal returns.

The Small-Firm Effect The so-called size or small-firm effect, originally documented by Banz,[26] is illustrated in Figure 11.4. It shows the historical performance of portfolios formed by dividing the NYSE stocks into 10 portfolios each year according to firm size (i.e., the total value of outstanding equity). Average annual returns between 1926 and 2021 are consistently higher on the small-firm portfolios. The difference in average annual return between portfolio 10 (with the largest firms) and portfolio 1 (with the smallest firms) is  $6.83\%$ . Of course, the smaller-firm portfolios tend to be riskier. But even when returns are adjusted for risk using the CAPM, there is still a substantial premium for the smaller-sized portfolios.

Imagine earning a premium of this size on a billion-dollar portfolio. Yet it is remarkable that following a simple (even simplistic) rule such as "invest in low-capitalization stocks" should enable an investor to earn excess returns. After all, any investor can measure firm size at little cost. One would not expect such minimal effort to yield such large rewards.

The Neglected-Firm and Liquidity Effects Arbel and Strebel gave another interpretation of the small-firm effect. Because small firms tend to be neglected by large institutional traders, information about smaller firms is less available. This information deficiency

"Brand-name" firms, after all, are subject to considerable monitoring from institutional investors, which promises high-quality information, and presumably investors do not purchase "generic" stocks without the prospect of greater returns.

Merton provides a rationale for this neglected-firm effect. He shows that neglected firms might be expected to earn higher equilibrium returns as compensation for the risk associated with limited information. In this sense, the neglected-firm premium is not strictly a market inefficiency, but is in fact a type of risk premium.

Work by Amihud and Mendelson $^{29}$  on the effect of liquidity on stock returns might be related to both the small-firm and neglected-firm effects. As we noted in Chapter 9, investors should demand a rate-of-return premium to invest in less-liquid stocks Amihud and Mendelson showed that illiquid stocks do in fact exhibit abnormally high risk-adjusted rates of return. Because small and less-analyzed stocks as a rule are less liquid, the liquidity effect might be a partial explanation of their abnormal returns. However, exploiting these effects can be difficult. The high trading costs that virtually define illiquidity can easily wipe out any apparent abnormal profit opportunity.

Book-to-Market Ratios Fama and French showed that a powerful predictor of returns across securities is the ratio of the book value of the firm's equity to the market value of equity. Fama and French stratified firms into 10 groups according to book-to-market ratios and

Figure 11.5 is an updated version of their results. The decile with the highest book-to-market ratio had an average annual return of  $16.7\%$ , while the lowest-ratio decile averaged only  $11.8\%$ . The dramatic dependence of returns on book-to-market ratio is independent of beta, suggesting either that high book-to-market ratio firms are relatively underpriced or that the book-to-market ratio is serving as a proxy for a risk factor that affects equilibrium expected returns.

In fact, Fama and French found that after controlling for the size and book-to-market effects, beta seemed to have no power to explain average security returns. This finding is an important challenge to the notion of rational markets because it seems to imply that a factor that should affect returns—systematic risk—seems not to matter, while a factor that should not matter—the book-to-market ratio—seems to predict future returns.


Post-Earnings-Announcement Price Drift A fundamental principle of efficient markets is that any new information ought to be rapidly reflected in stock prices. A puzzling anomaly, therefore, is the apparently sluggish response of stock prices to firms' earnings announcements, as uncovered by Ball and Brown.[31] Their results were later confirmed and extended in many other papers.[32]

The "news content" of an earnings announcement can be evaluated by comparing the announcement of actual earnings to the value previously expected by market participants. The difference is the "earnings surprise." (Market expectations of earnings can be roughly measured by averaging the published earnings forecasts of Wall Street analysts or by applying trend analysis to past earnings.) Rendleman, Jones, and Latane provide an influential study of sluggish price response to earnings announcements. They calculate earnings surprises for a large sample of firms, rank the magnitude of the surprise, divide firms into 10 deciles based on the size of the surprise, and calculate abnormal returns for each

$^{31}$ R. Ball and P. Brown, "An Empirical Evaluation of Accounting Income Numbers," Journal of Accounting Research 9 (1968), pp. 159-78.
32There are volumes of literature on this phenomenon, often referred to as post-earnings-announcement price drift. For example, see V. Bernard and J. Thomas, "Evidence That Stock Prices Do Not Fully Reflect the Implications of Current Earnings for Future Earnings," Journal of Accounting and Economics 13 (1990), pp. 305-40; or R. H. Battalio and R. Mendenhall, "Earnings Expectation, Investor Trade Size, and Anomalous Returns Around Earnings Announcements," Journal of Financial Economics 77 (2005), pp. 289-319.

decile. Figure 11.6 plots cumulative abnormal returns by decile.

Their results are dramatic. The correlation between ranking by earnings surprise and abnormal returns across deciles is unsurprising. There is a large abnormal return (a jump in cumulative abnormal return) on the earnings announcement day (time 0). The abnormal return is positive for positive-surprise firms and negative for negative-surprise firms.

The remarkable result concerns stock price movement after the announcement date. The cumulative abnormal returns of positive-surprise stocks continue to rise—in other words, exhibit momentum—even after the earnings information becomes public, while the negative-surprise firms continue to suffer negative abnormal returns. The market appears to adjust to the earnings information only gradually.

Evidently, one could have earned abnormal profits simply by waiting for earnings announcements and purchasing a stock portfolio of positive-earnings-surprise companies. These are precisely the types of predictable continuing trends that ought to be impossible in an efficient market.

Other Predictors of Stock Returns Our list of anomalies could go on and on. We will close with just a brief mention of some other characteristics that seem to have predicted stock returns.

Volatility. While the CAPM predicts that idiosyncratic volatility should not be related to stock returns, it appears that at intermediate horizons of 3-12 months, volatility is negatively associated with returns.[34]

Accruals and earnings quality. Accruals measure the component of earnings that does not reflect actual cash flows. For example, if a firm sells an item on credit, it may report a profit, but the immediate impact of the sale is an increase in accounts receivable (an accrual), not cash. High accruals have predicted low future returns.[35] This is sometimes

viewed as an earnings quality factor as it appears that management can and sometimes does manipulate accruals to paint a rosy view of earnings.[36]

Growth. More rapidly growing firms, for example, with high capital investments, sales growth, asset growth, or high recent share issuance, tend to have lower future returns. Other variables used to classify shares as growth versus value investments are the ratios of earnings to share price, cash flow to share price, payout ratio, analyst growth forecasts, and analyst earnings forecasts to price.

Profitability. Gross profitability seems to predict higher stock returns. $^{38}$  Gross profitability is computed by adding back some items conventionally treated as expenses, for example, advertising or research and development. The idea is that these expenditures may be better viewed as investments than expenses if they will enhance future earnings.  $q$ -factor. Economists call the ratio of the present value of an investment to its cost Tobin's  $q$  (after James Tobin, who first used the ratio). Hou, Xue, and Zhang $^{39}$  show that  $q$  is a good predictor of average stock returns. High  $q$  might plausibly imply a low discount rate because that low rate would result in high present values and therefore a high  $q$ -ratio. And, in fact,  $q$  seems to predict lower equilibrium returns. Notice that given the direct impact of discount rates on asset valuation, one might interpret this pattern as a rational risk-return relation rather than as an anomaly.

# Strong-Form Tests: Inside Information

It would not be surprising if insiders were able to make superior profits trading in their firm's stock. In other words, we do not expect markets to be strong-form efficient; we regulate and limit trades based on inside information. The ability of insiders to trade profitably in their own stock has been documented in studies by Jaffe, $^{40}$  Seyhun, $^{41}$  Givoly and Palmon, $^{42}$  and others. Jaffe's was one of the first to document the tendency for stock prices to rise after insiders intensively bought shares and fall after insiders intensively sold shares.

Can other investors benefit by following insiders' trades? The Securities and Exchange Commission requires insiders to register their trading activity, and these trades become public. If markets are efficient, fully and immediately processing that information, an investor should not be able to profit from following those trades. Several Internet sites contain information on insider trading.

The study by Seyhun found that following insider transactions would be to no avail. Although there was some tendency for stock prices to increase even after the report of insider buying, the abnormal returns were not large enough to overcome transaction costs.

# Interpreting the Anomalies

How should we interpret the ever-growing anomalies literature? Does it imply that markets are grossly inefficient, allowing for simplistic trading rules to offer large profit opportunities? Or are there other, more-subtle interpretations?

Risk Premiums or Inefficiencies? The small-firm, book-to-market, momentum, and long-term reversal effects are among the most puzzling phenomena in empirical finance. There are several interpretations of these effects. First, note that to some extent, some of these phenomena may be related. One feature that small firms, high-book-to-market firms, and recent "losers" seem to have in common is a stock price that has fallen considerably in recent months or years. Indeed, a firm can become a small firm or a high-book-to-market firm by suffering a sharp drop in price. These groups therefore may contain a relatively high proportion of distressed firms that have suffered recent difficulties.

Fama and French argue that these effects can be explained as manifestations of risk premiums. Using their three-factor model, introduced in the previous chapter, they show that stocks with higher betas (also known as factor loadings in this context) on size or book-to-market factors have higher average returns; they interpret these returns as evidence of a risk premium associated with the factor. This model does a much better job than the one-factor CAPM in explaining security returns. While size or book-to-market ratios per se are obviously not risk factors, they might act as proxies for more fundamental determinants of risk. In this regard, it is noteworthy that returns to "style portfolios," for example, the return on portfolios constructed based on the ratio of book-to-market value (specifically, the Fama-French high-minus-low book-to-market portfolio) or firm size (the return on the small-minus-big firm portfolio), do indeed seem to predict business cycles in many countries. Figure 11.7 shows that returns on these portfolios tend to have positive returns in years prior to rapid growth in gross domestic product.

The opposite interpretation is offered by Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny,[44] who argue that these phenomena are evidence of inefficient markets, more specifically, of systematic errors in the forecasts of stock analysts. They believe that analysts extrapolate past performance too far into the future, and therefore overprice firms with recent good performance and underprice firms with recent poor performance. Ultimately, when market participants recognize their errors, prices reverse. This explanation is consistent with the reversal effect and also, to a degree, with the small-firm and book-to-market effects because firms with sharp price drops may tend to be small or have high book-to-market ratios.

If Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny are correct, we ought to find that analysts systematically err when forecasting returns of recent "winner" versus "loser" firms. And, in fact, La Porta finds that shares of firms for which analysts predict low growth rates of earnings actually perform better than those with high expected earnings growth.

Analysts seem overly pessimistic about firms with low growth prospects and overly optimistic about firms with high growth prospects. When these too-extreme expectations are "corrected," the low-expected-growth firms outperform high-expected-growth firms.

Anomalies or Data Mining? We have covered several of the so-called anomalies cited in the literature, but our list could go on and on. Some wonder whether these anomalies are really unexplained puzzles in financial markets, or whether they simply reflect data mining. After all, if one reruns the computer database of past returns over and over and examines stock returns along enough dimensions, simple chance will cause some criteria to appear to predict returns.

Given this threat and growing evidence of data mining, there have been numerous calls to toughen standards for the "acceptance" of a new pricing factor. For example, Cam Harvey, in his presidential address to the American Finance Association,[46] suggested (among other things) increasing thresholds of statistical significance to avoid "false positives." Others have proposed related changes in methodology. We will consider some of these suggestions in Chapter 13.

Still, even acknowledging the potential for data mining, a common thread seems to run through many of these anomalies, lending support to the notion that there is a real puzzle to explain. Value stocks—defined by low P/E ratio, high book-to-market ratio, or depressed prices relative to historic levels—seem to have provided higher average returns than "glamour" or growth stocks.

One way to address the problem of data mining is to find a dataset that has not already been researched and see whether the relationship in question shows up in the new data. Such studies have revealed size, momentum, and book-to-market effects in security markets around the world. While these phenomena may be a manifestation of a systematic risk premium, the precise nature of that risk is not fully understood.

Anomalies over Time We pointed out earlier that while no market can be perfectly efficient, in well-functioning markets, anomalies ought to be self-destructing. As market participants learn of profitable trading strategies, their attempts to exploit them should move prices to levels at which abnormal profits are no longer available.

McLean and Pontiff $^{47}$  test this dynamic. They identify 97 characteristics identified in the academic literature as associated with abnormal returns and track the publication date of each finding. They compare abnormal returns provided by each strategy to abnormal returns in two out-of-sample periods. The first is the period from the end of each study's sample period to the date of publication, and the second is the period following publication. If the original finding were totally spurious and due solely to data mining, the anomaly would disappear out of sample. However, if the result is "real," abnormal returns should persist. But if the strategy's efficacy reflects mispricing, then as information about it becomes more widely disseminated (for example, by publication in academic journals) and is exploited by arbitrageurs, its predictive value should diminish over time.

It turns out that portfolio returns are  $28\%$  lower in the first out-of-sample period, which suggests that some, but far from all, of the anomalous returns were due to data snooping. Abnormal returns were  $58\%$  lower in the second (post-publication) period, which suggests that investors learn about mispricing from the academic literature, attempt to exploit it, and in the process push prices closer to their "correct" values. This last conclusion is buttressed by the observation that trading volume in stocks identified with anomalies increase, as does short interest in "overpriced" stocks. These patterns are consistent with informed participants attempting to exploit newly recognized mispricing.

The authors also find that anomalies are more persistent for stocks that are more difficult to arbitrage. For example, the decay in abnormal returns is most pronounced for stocks that are larger, are more liquid, and have low idiosyncratic risk. These are precisely the stocks for which trading activity in pursuit of reliable abnormal returns is most feasible. Thus, while abnormal returns do not fully disappear, these results are consistent with a market groping its way toward greater efficiency.

# Bubbles and Market Efficiency

Every so often, asset prices seem (at least in retrospect) to lose their grounding in reality. For example, in the tulip mania in 17th-century Holland, tulip prices peaked at several times the annual income of a skilled worker. This episode has become the symbol of a speculative "bubble" in which prices appear to depart from any semblance of intrinsic value. Bubbles seem to arise when a rapid run-up in prices creates a widespread expectation that they will continue to rise. As more and more investors try to get in on the action, they push prices even further. Inevitably, however, the run-up stalls and the bubble ends in a crash.

Less than a century after tulip mania, the South Sea Bubble in England became almost as famous. In this episode, the share price of the South Sea Company rose from £128 in January 1720 to £550 in May and peaked at around £1,000 in August—just before the bubble burst and the share price collapsed to £150 in September, leading to widespread bankruptcies among those who had borrowed to buy shares on credit. In fact, the company was a major lender of money to investors willing to buy (and thus bid up) its shares. This sequence may sound familiar to anyone who lived through the dot-com boom and bust of 1995-2002 $^{48}$  or, more recently, the financial turmoil of 2008, with origins widely attributed to a collapsing bubble in housing prices.


It is hard to defend the position that security prices in these instances represented rational, unbiased assessments of intrinsic value. And, in fact, some economists, most notably Hyman Minsky,[49] have suggested that bubbles arise naturally. During periods of stability and rising prices, investors extrapolate that stability into the future and become more willing to take on risk. Risk premiums shrink, leading to further increases in asset prices, and expectations become even more optimistic in a self-fulfilling cycle. But in the end, pricing and risk taking become excessive and the bubble bursts. Ironically, the initial period of stability fosters behavior that ultimately results in instability.

But beware of jumping to the conclusion that asset prices may generally be thought of as arbitrary and obvious trading opportunities abundant. First, most bubbles become "obvious" only in retrospect. At the time, the price run-up often seems to have a plausible rationale. In the dot-com boom, for example, many contemporary observers rationalized stock price gains as justified by the prospect of a new and more profitable economy, driven by technological advances. Even the irrationality of the tulip mania may have been overblown in its later retelling.[50] In addition, security valuation is intrinsically difficult and estimates of intrinsic value are inevitably imprecise. Given this, large bets on perceived mispricing may entail hubris.

Moreover, even if you suspect that prices are in fact "wrong," taking advantage of them can be difficult. We explore these issues in more detail in the following chapter, but for now, we simply point out some impediments to making aggressive bets against an asset, among them the costs of short selling overpriced securities as well as potential problems obtaining the securities to sell short, and the possibility that even if you are ultimately correct, the market may disagree and prices still can move dramatically against you in the short term, thus wiping out your capital.

# 11.5 Mutual Fund and Analyst Performance

We have documented some of the apparent chinks in the armor of efficient market proponents. For investors, the issue of market efficiency boils down to whether skilled investors can make consistent abnormal trading profits, so we will compare the performance of market professionals to that of a passive index fund. We will look at two facets of professional performance: that of stock market analysts who recommend investment positions and that of mutual fund managers who actually manage portfolios.

# Stock Market Analysts

Stock market analysts historically have worked for brokerage firms, which presents a problem in interpreting their advice: Analysts have tended to be overwhelmingly positive

48The dot-com boom gave rise to the term irrational exuberance. In this vein, consider that one company going public in the investment boom of 1720 described itself simply as "a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is."
49Hyman P. Minsky, Stabilizing an Unstable Economy (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1986).
For interesting discussions of this possibility, see Peter Garber, *Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of Early Manias* (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2000), and Anne Goldgar, *Tulipmania: Money, Honor, and Knowledge in the Dutch Golden Age* (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007).

in their assessment of the prospects of firms.[51] For example, on a scale of 1 (strong buy) to 5 (strong sell), the average recommendation for 5,628 covered firms in 1996 was 2.04.[52] As a result, we cannot take positive recommendations (e.g., to buy) at face value. Instead, we must look at either the relative enthusiasm of analyst recommendations, compared to those for other firms, or at the change in consensus recommendations.

Womack focuses on changes in analysts' recommendations and finds that positive changes are associated with increased stock prices of about  $5\%$ , and negative changes result in average price decreases of  $11\%$ . One might wonder whether these price changes reflect the market's recognition of analysts' superior information or insight about firms or, instead, simply result from new buy or sell pressure brought on by the recommendations themselves. Womack argues that price impact seems to be permanent and therefore consistent with the hypothesis that analysts do in fact reveal new information. Jegadeesh, Kim, Krische, and Lee also find that changes in consensus recommendations are reliably associated with price changes, but that the levels of recommendations are not.

Barber, Lehavy, McNichols, and Trueman focus on the level of consensus recommendations and show that firms with the most-favorable recommendations outperform those with the least-favorable recommendations. However, they note that portfolio strategies based on analyst recommendations would result in heavy trading activity with associated costs that probably would wipe out the potential profits from the strategy.

# Mutual Fund Managers

As we pointed out in Chapter 4, casual evidence does not support the claim that professionally managed portfolios can consistently beat the market. Figure 4.2 in that chapter demonstrated that in the last 50 years, a passive market index portfolio typically outperformed the average equity fund.

Of course, one might argue that there are good managers and bad managers, and that good managers can, in fact, consistently outperform the index. We need to ask whether managers with good performance in one year are likely to repeat that performance in a following year. Is superior performance in any particular year due to luck, and therefore random, or due to skill, and therefore consistent from year to year? To answer this question, we can divide a sample of equity mutual fund portfolios into two groups based on total investment return and see whether top-half performers in one period continue to perform well in a subsequent period.

Table 11.1 presents such an analysis. The table shows the fraction of "winning funds" (i.e., top-half performers) in 2019 that turned out to be winners in 2020 and then, for those funds that continued to perform well in 2020, the fraction that repeated first-half performance yet again in 2021. If performance were due entirely to skill, with no randomness, we would expect to see entries of  $100\%$  because each above-average fund would continue to be above average. On the other hand, if performance were purely random from one year to the next, outperformance would essentially be a coin flip, and we would expect entries of  $50\%$  for one-year continuation and only  $25\%$  (i.e.,  $50\%$  of  $50\%$ ) for two-year

Consistency of Investment Results. Percentage of top-half funds that remain in the top half in the following two years.

Table 11.1

<table><tr><td></td><td>Number of top-half performers in year ending June 2019</td><td>Percentage of 2019 outperformers that perform in top half of sample in year ending June 2020</td><td>Percentage of 2019 outperformers that perform in top half of sample in both year ending June 2020 and year ending June 2021</td></tr><tr><td>All domestic equity funds</td><td>1,041</td><td>71.8</td><td>19.0</td></tr><tr><td>Large-cap equity funds</td><td>373</td><td>61.1</td><td>25.5</td></tr><tr><td>Small-cap equity funds</td><td>261</td><td>69.4</td><td>16.5</td></tr></table> continuation. In fact, the actual pattern of continuation is mixed. There seems to be some persistence over short periods (the entries in the 2020 column exceed  $50\%$ ), but at a two-year horizon, consistency is actually weaker than would be predicted even if performance were completely random (with entries in the last column generally below  $25\%$ ).

Other studies (for example, the Carhart article cited below) also suggest that there is little performance persistence among professional managers, and, if anything, that bad performance is more likely to persist than good performance. This makes some sense: It is easy to identify fund characteristics that will result in consistently poor investment performance, notably, high expense ratios and high turnover ratios with associated trading costs. It is far harder to identify the secrets of successful stock picking. (If it were easy, we would all be rich!)

Of course, these results are based on total returns, without adjustment for exposure to systematic risk factors. Therefore, we should revisit the question of mutual fund performance, paying more attention to the appropriate performance benchmark.

As a first pass, we might examine the risk-adjusted returns (i.e., the alpha) of a large sample of mutual funds. But the market index may not be an adequate benchmark against which to evaluate mutual fund returns. For example, suppose mutual funds tend to maintain considerable holdings in equity of small firms, whereas the capitalization-weighted index is dominated by large firms. Then funds as a whole will tend to outperform the index when small firms outperform large ones and underperform when small firms fare worse. The "style choice," that is, the exposure to small stocks (which is an asset allocation decision) would dominate the evaluation of performance even though it has little to do with managers' stock-picking ability.[56]

The conventional performance benchmark today is a four-factor model, which employs the three Fama-French factors (the return on the market index, and returns to portfolios based on size and book-to-market ratio) augmented by a momentum factor (a portfolio constructed based on prior-year stock return). Alphas constructed using an expanded index model using these four factors control for a wide range of style choices that may affect returns, for example, an inclination to growth versus value or small- versus large-capitalization stocks. Figure 11.8 shows a frequency distribution of four-factor alphas for U.S. domestic equity funds.[57] The results show that the distribution of alpha is roughly bell shaped, with a slightly negative mean. On average, it does not appear that these funds outperform their style-adjusted benchmarks.

Remember that the asset allocation decision is usually in the hands of the individual investor. Investors allocate their investment portfolios to funds in asset classes they desire to hold, and they can reasonably expect only that mutual fund portfolio managers will choose stocks advantageously within those asset classes.

Consistent with Figure 11.8, Fama and French[58] use the four-factor model to assess the performance of equity mutual funds and show that, while they may exhibit positive alphas before fees, after the fees charged to their customers, average alpha is negative. Likewise, Wermers,[59] who uses both style portfolios as well as the characteristics of the stocks held by mutual funds to control for performance, also finds positive gross alphas but negative net alphas after controlling for fees and risk.

Carhart $^{60}$  reexamines the issue of consistency in mutual fund performance and finds that, after controlling for these factors, there is only minor persistence in relative performance across managers. Moreover, much of that persistence seems due to expenses and transactions costs rather than gross investment returns. Thus, any consistency we observe in fund performance may be due in large part to wasteful portfolio practices. This suggests that the real value of past performance data is to avoid truly poor funds, even if identifying the future top performers is still a daunting task.

However, Bollen and Busse $^{61}$  do find evidence of performance persistence, at least over short horizons. They rank mutual fund performance using the four-factor model over a base quarter, assign funds into one of ten deciles according to base-period alpha, and then look at performance in the following quarter. Figure 11.9 illustrates their results. The dashed line is the average alpha of funds within each of the deciles in the base period (expressed on a quarterly basis). The steepness of that curve reflects the considerable dispersion in performance in the ranking period. The solid line is the average performance of the funds in each decile in the following quarter. The shallowness of this curve indicates that most of the original

Nevertheless, the plot is still clearly downward-sloping, so it appears that, at least over a short horizon such as one quarter, there is some performance consistency. However, that persistence is probably too small a fraction of the original performance differential to justify performance-chasing by mutual fund customers.
Figure 11.9 Risk-adjusted performance in ranking quarter and following quarter


This pattern is actually consistent with the prediction of an influential paper by Berk and Green.[62] They argue that skilled mutual fund managers with abnormal performance will attract new funds until the additional costs and challenges of managing those extra funds drive alphas down to zero. Thus, skill will show up not in superior returns, but rather in the amount of funds under management. Therefore, even if managers are skilled, alphas will be short-lived, as they seem to be in Figure 11.9.

Del Guercio and Reuter[63] offer a finer interpretation of mutual fund performance. They split mutual fund investors into those who buy funds directly for themselves versus those who purchase funds through brokers, reasoning that the direct-sold segment may be more financially literate while the broker-sold segment is less comfortable making financial decisions without professional advice. Consistent with this hypothesis, they show that direct-sold investors direct their assets to funds with positive alphas (consistent with the Berk-Green model), but broker-sold investors generally do not. This provides a greater incentive for direct-sold funds to invest relatively more in alpha-generating inputs such as talented portfolio managers or analysts. Moreover, they show that the after-fee performance of direct-sold funds is as good as that of index funds (again, consistent with Berk-Green), while the performance of broker-sold funds is considerably worse. It thus appears that the average underperformance of actively managed mutual funds is driven largely by broker-sold funds and that this underperformance may be interpreted as an implicit cost that less-informed investors pay for the advice they get from their brokers.

In contrast to the extensive studies of equity fund managers, there have been few studies of the performance of bond fund managers. Blake, Elton, and Gruber $^{64}$  examined the performance of fixed-income mutual funds. They found that, on average, bond funds underperform passive fixed-income indexes by an amount roughly equal to expenses, and that there is no evidence that past performance can predict future performance. Chen, Ferson, and Peters (2010) $^{65}$  found that, on average, bond mutual funds outperform passive bond indexes in terms of gross returns but underperform once the fees they charge their investors are subtracted, a result similar to those others have found for equity funds.

Thus, the evidence on the risk-adjusted performance of professional managers is mixed at best. We conclude that the performance of professional managers is broadly consistent with market efficiency. The amounts by which professional managers as a group beat or are beaten by the market fall within the margin of statistical uncertainty. In any event, it is clear that performance superior to passive strategies is far from routine. Studies show either that most managers cannot outperform passive strategies or that if there is a margin of superiority, it is small.

On the other hand, a small number of investment superstars—Peter Lynch (formerly of Fidelity's Magellan Fund), Warren Buffett (of Berkshire Hathaway), John Templeton (formerly of Templeton Funds), and Mario Gabelli (of GAMCO), among them—have compiled career records that show a consistency of superior performance hard to reconcile with absolutely efficient markets. In an analysis of mutual fund "stars," Kosowski, Timmerman, Wermers, and White[66] conclude that the stock-picking ability of a minority of managers is sufficient to cover their costs and that their superior performance tends to persist over time. However, Nobel Prize-winning Paul Samuelson[67] reviewed this investment hall of fame and pointed out that the records of the vast majority of professional money managers offer convincing evidence that there are no easy strategies to guarantee success in the securities markets.

# So, Are Markets Efficient?

There is a telling joke about two economists walking down the street. They spot a 20 bill on the sidewalk. One stoops to pick it up, but the other one says, "Don't bother; if the bill were real, someone would have picked it up already."

The lesson is clear. An overly doctrinaire belief in efficient markets can paralyze the investor and make it appear that no research effort can be justified. This extreme view is probably unwarranted. There are enough anomalies in the empirical evidence to justify the search for underpriced securities that clearly goes on.

The bulk of the evidence, however, suggests that any supposedly superior investment strategy should be taken with many grains of salt. The market is competitive enough that only differentially superior information or insight will earn money; the easy pickings have been picked. In the end, it is likely that the margin of superiority that any professional manager can add is so slight that the statistician will not easily be able to detect it.

We conclude that markets are generally very efficient, but that rewards to the especially diligent, intelligent, or creative may, in fact, be waiting.

# SUMMARY

1. Statistical research has shown that to a close approximation, stock prices seem to follow a random walk with no discernible predictable patterns that investors can exploit. Such findings are now taken to be evidence of market efficiency, that is, evidence that market prices reflect all currently available information. Only new information will move stock prices, and this information is equally likely to be good news or bad news.
2. Market participants distinguish among three forms of the efficient market hypothesis. The weak form asserts that all information to be derived from past trading data already is reflected in stock prices. The semistrong form claims that all publicly available information is already reflected. The strong form, which generally is acknowledged to be extreme, asserts that all information, including insider information, is reflected in prices.
3. Technical analysis focuses on stock price patterns and on proxies for buy or sell pressure in the market. Fundamental analysis focuses on the determinants of the underlying value of the firm, such as current profitability and growth prospects. Because both types of analysis are based on public information, neither should generate excess profits if markets are operating efficiently.
4. Proponents of the efficient market hypothesis often advocate passive as opposed to active investment strategies. Passive investors buy and hold a broad-based market index. They expend resources neither on market research nor on frequent purchase and sale of stocks. Passive strategies may be tailored to meet individual investor requirements.
5. Event studies are used to evaluate the economic impact of events of interest, using abnormal stock returns. Such studies usually show that there is some leakage of inside information to some market participants before the public announcement date. Therefore, insiders do seem to be able to exploit their access to information to at least a limited extent.
6. One notable exception to weak-form market efficiency is the apparent success of momentum-based strategies over intermediate-term horizons.
7. Several anomalies regarding fundamental analysis have been uncovered. These include the value-versus-growth effect, the small-firm effect, the momentum effect, and post-earnings-announcement price drift. Whether these anomalies represent market inefficiency or poorly understood risk premiums is still a matter of debate.
8. By and large, the performance record of professionally managed funds lends little credence to claims that most professionals can consistently beat the market. Superior performance in one period does not generally predict superior performance going forward.

c. Suppose now that Changing Fortunes wins a major lawsuit during the year. The settlement is 5 million. Changing Fortunes's stock return during the year turns out to be 10\%. What is your best guess as to the settlement the market previously expected Changing Fortunes to receive from the lawsuit? (Continue to assume that the market return in the year turned out to be 10\%.) The magnitude of the settlement is the only unexpected firm-specific event during the year.

22. Dollar-cost averaging means that you buy equal dollar amounts of a stock every period, for example, 500 per month. The strategy is based on the idea that when the stock price is low, your fixed monthly purchase will buy more shares, and when the price is high, fewer shares. Averaging over time, you will end up buying more shares when the stock is cheaper and fewer when it is relatively expensive. Therefore, by design, you will exhibit good market timing. Evaluate this strategy.
23. We know that the market should respond positively to good news and that good-news events such as the coming end of a recession can be predicted with at least some accuracy. Why, then, can we not predict that the market will go up as the economy recovers?
24. You know that firm XYZ is very poorly run. On a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best), you would give it a score of 3. The market consensus evaluation is that the management score is only 2. Should you buy or sell the stock?
25. Suppose that during a certain week the Fed announces a new monetary growth policy, Congress surprisingly passes legislation restricting imports of foreign automobiles, and Ford comes out with a new car model that it believes will increase profits substantially. How might you go about measuring the market's assessment of Ford's new model?
26. Good News, Inc., just announced an increase in its annual earnings, yet its stock price fell. Is there a rational explanation for this phenomenon?
27. Shares of small firms with thinly traded stocks tend to show positive CAPM alphas. Is this a violation of the efficient market hypothesis?
28. Examine the accompanying figure, which presents cumulative abnormal returns both before and after dates on which insiders buy or sell shares in their firms. How do you interpret this figure? What are we to make of the pattern of CARs before and after the event date?

29. Suppose that as the economy moves through a business cycle, risk premiums also change. For example, in a recession, when people are concerned about their jobs, risk tolerance might be lower and risk premiums might be higher. In a booming economy, tolerance for risk might be higher and premiums lower.

a. Would a predictably shifting risk premium such as described here be a violation of the efficient market hypothesis?
b. How might a cycle of increasing and decreasing risk premiums create an appearance that stock prices "overreact," first falling excessively and then seeming to recover?

1. The semistrong form of the efficient market hypothesis asserts that stock prices:

$a$ . Fully reflect all historical price information.
$b$ . Fully reflect all publicly available information.
$c$ . Fully reflect all relevant information, including insider information.
$d$ . May be predictable.

2. Assume that a company announces an unexpectedly large cash dividend to its shareholders. In an efficient market without information leakage, one might expect:

$a$ . An abnormal price change at the announcement.
$b$ . An abnormal price increase before the announcement.
$c$ . An abnormal price decrease after the announcement.
$d$ . No abnormal price change before or after the announcement.

3. A "random walk" occurs when:

$a$ . Stock price changes are random but predictable.
$b$ . Stock prices respond slowly to both new and old information.
$c$ . Future price changes are uncorrelated with past price changes.
$d$ . Past information is useful in predicting future prices.

4. Two basic assumptions of technical analysis are that security prices adjust: a. Gradually to new information, and study of the economic environment provides an indication of future market movements.

b. Rapidly to new information, and study of the economic environment provides an indication of future market movements.
c. Rapidly to new information, and market prices are determined by the interaction between supply and demand.
$d$ . Gradually to new information, and prices are determined by the interaction between supply and demand.

5. Your investment client asks for information concerning the benefits of active portfolio management. She is particularly interested in the question of whether active managers can be expected to consistently exploit inefficiencies in the capital markets to produce above-average returns without assuming higher risk.

The semistrong form of the efficient market hypothesis asserts that all publicly available information is rapidly and correctly reflected in securities prices. This implies that investors cannot expect to derive above-average profits from purchases made after information has become public because security prices already reflect the information's full effects.

a. Identify and explain two examples of empirical evidence that tend to support the EMH implication stated above.
b. Identify and explain two examples of empirical evidence that tend to refute the EMH implication stated above.
c. Discuss reasons why an investor might choose not to index even if the markets were, in fact, semistrong-form efficient.

6. a. Briefly explain the concept of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) and each of its three forms—weak, semistrong, and strong—and briefly discuss the degree to which existing empirical evidence supports each of the three forms of the EMH.
b. Briefly discuss the implications of the efficient market hypothesis for investment policy as it applies to: i. Technical analysis in the form of charting.

ii. Fundamental analysis.

c. Briefly explain the roles or responsibilities of portfolio managers in an efficient market environment.

7. Growth and value can be defined in several ways. "Growth" usually conveys the idea of a portfolio emphasizing or including only issues believed to possess above-average future rates of per-share earnings growth. Low current yield, high price-to-book ratios, and high price-to-earnings ratios are typical characteristics of such portfolios. "Value" usually conveys the idea of portfolios emphasizing or including only issues currently showing low price-to-book ratios, low price-to-earnings ratios, above-average levels of dividend yield, and market prices believed to be below the issues' intrinsic values.

a. Identify and provide reasons why, over an extended period of time, value-stock investing might outperform growth-stock investing.
b. Explain why the outcome suggested in (a) should not be possible in a market widely regarded as being highly efficient.

# E-INVESTMENTS EXERCISE

1. Use data from finance.yahoo.com to answer the following questions: a. Collect the following data for 25 firms of your choosing.


i. Book-to-market ratio.
ii. Price—earnings ratio.
iii. Market capitalization (size).
iv. Price-cash flow ratio (i.e., market capitalization/operating cash flow).
v. Another criterion that interests you.

You can find this information by choosing a company and then clicking on Statistics. Rank the firms based on each of the criteria separately, and divide the firms into five groups based on their ranking for each criterion. Calculate the average rate of return for each group of firms.

Do you confirm or reject any of the anomalies cited in this chapter? Can you uncover a new anomaly? Note: For your test to be valid, you must form your portfolios based on criteria observed at the beginning of the period. Why?

b. Now form stock groups that use two criteria simultaneously. For example, form a portfolio of stocks that are both in the lowest quintile of price—earnings ratio and in the highest quintile of book-to-market ratio. Does selecting stocks based on more than one characteristic improve your ability to devise portfolios with abnormal returns? Repeat the analysis by forming groups that meet three criteria simultaneously. Does this yield any further improvement in abnormal returns?

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. a. A high-level manager might well have private information about the firm. Her ability to trade profitably on that information is not surprising. This ability does not violate weak-form efficiency: The abnormal profits are not derived from an analysis of past price and trading data. If they were, this would indicate that there is valuable information that can be gleaned from such analysis. But this ability does violate strong-form efficiency. Apparently, there is some private information that is not already reflected in stock prices.

$b$ . The information sets that pertain to the weak, semistrong, and strong forms of the EMH can be described by the following illustration:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/ca331cfac7b8d29397ab6adddfcf84366722828d1c8fff60c5ce6f663a43be96.jpg)

The weak-form information set includes only the history of prices and volumes. The semistrong-form set includes the weak-form set plus all publicly available information. In turn, the strong-form set includes the semistrong set plus insiders' information. It is illegal to act on this incremental information (insiders' private information). The direction of valid implication is

$$
\text {S t r o n g - f o r m} \mathrm {E M H} \Rightarrow \text {S e m i s t r o n g - f o r m} \mathrm {E M H} \Rightarrow \text {W e a k - f o r m} \mathrm {E M H}
$$

The reverse direction implication is not valid. For example, stock prices may reflect all past price data (weak-form efficiency) but may not reflect relevant fundamental data (semistrong-form inefficiency).

2. The point made in the preceding discussion is that the very fact that we observe stock prices near so-called resistance levels belies the assumption that the price can be a resistance level. If a stock is observed to sell at any price, then investors must believe that a fair rate of return can be earned if the stock is purchased at that price. It is logically impossible for a stock to have a resistance level and offer a fair rate of return at prices just below the resistance level. If we accept that prices are appropriate, we must reject any presumption concerning resistance levels.
3. If everyone follows a passive strategy, sooner or later prices will fail to reflect new information. At this point there are profit opportunities for active investors who uncover mispriced securities. As they buy and sell these assets, prices again will be driven toward fair levels.
4. Predictably declining CARs do violate the EMH. If one can predict such a phenomenon, a profit opportunity emerges: Sell (or short sell) the affected stocks on an event date just before their prices are predicted to fall.
5. The answer depends on your prior beliefs about market efficiency. Miller's record through 2005 was incredibly strong. On the other hand, with so many funds in existence, it is less surprising that some funds would appear to be consistently superior after the fact. Exceptional past performance of a small number of managers is possible by chance even in an efficient market. A better test is provided in "continuation studies." Are better performers in one period more likely to repeat that performance in later periods? Miller's record after 2005 fails the continuation or consistency criterion.

# Behavioral Finance and Technical Analysis

# 12

THE EFFICIENT MARKET hypothesis makes two important predictions. First, it implies that security prices properly reflect whatever information is available to investors. A second implication follows immediately: Active traders will find it difficult to outperform passive strategies such as holding market indexes. To do so would require differential insight; in a highly competitive market, this is hard to come by.

Unfortunately, it is hard to devise measures of the "true" or intrinsic value of a security and correspondingly difficult to test directly whether prices match those values. Therefore, most tests of market efficiency have focused on the performance of active trading strategies. These tests have been of two kinds. The anomalies literature has examined strategies that apparently would have provided superior risk-adjusted returns (e.g., investing in stocks with momentum or in value rather than glamour stocks). Other tests have looked at the results of actual investments by asking whether professional managers have been able to beat the market.

Neither class of tests has proven fully conclusive. The anomalies literature suggests that several strategies would have provided superior returns. But there are questions as to whether some of these apparent anomalies reflect risk premiums not captured by simple models of risk and return or even if some merely reflect data mining. Moreover, the apparent inability of the typical money manager to turn these anomalies into reliably superior returns on actual portfolios casts additional doubt on their "reality."


Behavioral finance argues that the sprawling literature on trading strategies has missed a larger and more important point by overlooking the first implication of efficient markets—the correctness of security prices. This may be the more important implication because market economies rely on prices to allocate resources efficiently. The behavioral school argues that even if security prices are wrong, exploiting them still can be difficult and, therefore, the failure to uncover obviously successful trading rules or traders cannot be taken as proof of market efficiency.

Whereas conventional theories treat investors as rational, behavioral finance starts with the presumption that they are not. We will examine some of the information-processing and behavioral irrationalities uncovered by psychologists in other contexts and show how these tendencies applied to financial markets might result in some of the anomalies discussed in the previous chapter. We then consider the limitations of strategies designed to take advantage of behaviorally induced mispricing. If the limits to such arbitrage activity are severe, mispricing can survive even if some rational investors attempt to exploit it. We turn next to technical analysis and show how behavioral models give some support to techniques that clearly would be useless in efficient


markets. We close the chapter with a brief survey of some of these technical strategies.

# 12.1 The Behavioral Critique

The premise of behavioral finance is that conventional financial theory ignores how real people make decisions and that people make a difference. A growing number of economists have come to interpret the anomalies literature as consistent with several "irrationalities" that seem to characterize individuals making complicated decisions. These irrationalities fall into two broad categories: first, that investors do not always process information correctly and therefore infer incorrect probability distributions about future rates of return; and second, that even given a probability distribution of returns, they often make inconsistent or systematically suboptimal decisions.

Of course, the existence of irrational investors would not by itself be sufficient to render capital markets inefficient. If such irrationalities did affect prices, then sharp-eyed arbitrageurs taking advantage of profit opportunities might be expected to push prices back to their proper values. Thus, the second leg of the behavioral critique is that in practice the actions of such arbitrageurs are limited and therefore insufficient to force prices to intrinsic value.

This leg of the argument is important. Virtually everyone agrees that if prices are right (i.e., price = intrinsic value), then there are no easy profit opportunities. But the reverse is not necessarily true. If behaviorists are correct about limits to arbitrage activity, then the absence of profit opportunities does not necessarily imply that markets are efficient. We've noted that most tests of the efficient market hypothesis have focused on the existence of profit opportunities, often as reflected in the performance of money managers. But their failure to systematically outperform passive investment strategies need not imply that markets are actually efficient, with price equal to intrinsic value.

We will start our summary of the behavioral critique with the first leg of the argument, surveying a sample of the informational processing errors uncovered by psychologists in other areas. We next examine a few of the behavioral irrationalities that seem to characterize decision makers. Finally, we look at limits to arbitrage activity and conclude with a tentative assessment of the import of the behavioral debate.

# Information Processing

Errors in information processing can lead investors to misestimate the true probabilities of possible events or associated rates of return. Several such biases have been uncovered. Here are five of the more important ones.

The discussion in this section is largely based on Nicholas Barberis and Richard Thaler, "A Survey of Behavioral Finance," in Handbook of the Economics of Finance, ed. G. M. Constantinides, M. Harris, and R. Stulz (Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2003); and David Hirshleifer, "Behavioral Finance," Annual Review of Financial Economics 7 (2015), pp. 133-59.

Limited Attention, Underreaction, and Overreaction Individuals have limited time and attention and as a result may rely on rules of thumb or intuitive decision-making procedures known as heuristics. Limited analytic processing capacity may also cause them to overreact to salient or attention-grabbing news and underreact to less salient information.

These sorts of limitations would be consistent with the accruals anomaly reported by Sloan $^2$  that we noted in the last chapter. If investors pay attention to "headline" earnings announcements, but comparatively neglect the less apparent extent to which accruals management has been used to manipulate reported earnings, then high current accruals (which artificially inflate reported earnings) will be a predictor of poor future returns (when the impact of that earnings management is eventually recognized). This is an example of investor underreaction to the information contained in accruals.

Recent events are typically more salient to investors, and this salience can lead to overreaction rather than underreaction biases. For example, when investors react to positive recent earnings news, they may overweight its significance and project performance too far into the future. De Bondt and Thaler argue that this can result in a high initial P/E (due to the excessive optimism built into the stock price) and poor subsequent performance when investors recognize their error. Thus, high P/E firms tend to be poor investments.

Overconfidence People tend to overestimate the precision of their beliefs or forecasts, and they tend to overestimate their abilities. In one famous survey,  $90\%$  of drivers in Sweden ranked themselves as better-than-average drivers. Such overconfidence may be responsible for the prevalence of active versus passive investment management—itself an anomaly to adherents of the efficient market hypothesis. Despite the growing popularity of indexing, only about  $40\%$  of the assets in mutual and exchange-traded funds are held in indexed accounts. The continued prevalence of active management in the face of the typical underperformance of such strategies (consider the generally disappointing performance of actively managed mutual funds reviewed in Chapter 4 as well as in the previous chapter) is consistent with a tendency to overestimate ability.

An interesting example of overconfidence in financial markets is provided by Barber and Odean, who compare trading activity and average returns in brokerage accounts of men and women. They find that men (in particular, single men) trade far more actively than women, consistent with the generally greater overconfidence among men documented in the psychology literature. They also find that trading activity is highly predictive of poor investment performance. The top  $20\%$  of accounts ranked by portfolio turnover had average returns 7 percentage points lower than the  $20\%$  of the accounts with the lowest turnover rates. As they conclude, "trading [and by implication, overconfidence] is hazardous to your wealth."

Lest you think these findings were just a statistical fluke, Fidelity replicated these studies using 5.2 million of its own customer accounts for the decade ending in 2020 and found

2R. G. Sloan, "Do Stock Prices Fully Reflect Information in Accruals and Cash Flows About Future Earnings?", Accounting Review 71 (2006), pp. 289-315.
 Just as overconfidence can degrade portfolio investments, it also can lead such firms to make poor investments in real assets.

Conservatism A conservatism bias means that investors are too slow (too conservative) in updating their beliefs in response to new evidence. This means that they might initially underreact to news about a firm so that prices will fully reflect new information only gradually. Such a bias would give rise to momentum in stock market returns.

Confirmation Bias Confirmation bias is the tendency to interpret new information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs. This bias causes people to emphasize signals that support their views and, symmetrically, to comparatively disregard information that would call those views into question.

Friesen, Weller, and Dunham point out that this sort of bias could lead to both momentum and reversal anomalies. For example, suppose traders have come to a positive view on prospects for the stock market. If they then receive more ambiguous signals about future performance, they will be prone to interpret those signals too optimistically (confirming their current beliefs) and therefore will further drive up prices. This leads to a short-term momentum property. Eventually, however, as information continues to arrive and beliefs are nudged in a more rational direction, those price gains will be corrected, leading to a reversal effect.

In fact, with a richer set of signals, for example, signals that come with different information content and at different frequencies, confirmation bias and its eventual but inevitable dissipation can generate even more complicated stock price patterns. Interestingly, one is the head-and-shoulders pattern that has a long tradition in technical analysis (see Figure 12.6 and the accompanying discussion later in this chapter).

As reported in Ron Lieber, "Women May Be Better Investors Than Men. Let Me Mansplain Why." The New York Times, October 30, 2021.
$^{6}$ U. Malmendier and G. Tate, "Who Makes Acquisitions? CEO Overconfidence and the Market's Reaction," Journal of Financial Economics 89 (July 2008), pp. 20-43.
Geoffrey C. Friesen, Paul A. Weller, and Lee M. Dunham, "Price Trends and Patterns in Technical Analysis: A Theoretical and Empirical Examination," Journal of Banking and Finance 33 (2009), pp. 1089-100.

While confirmation bias is not his focus, Shiller makes a point related to it in his discussion of the potential for market bubbles or fads. He notes that people regularly appear to suppress certain facts and amplify others if doing so fits into their point of view. The willingness to focus disproportionately on supportive facts means that investors can be "buffeted en masse from one superficially plausible theory about valuation to another" and that "investing ideas can spread like epidemics."

Extrapolation and Pattern Recognition People are adept at discerning patterns, sometimes even perceiving patterns that may be illusory. They also are overly prone to believe, even when employing only limited evidence, that these patterns are likely to characterize an entire population, especially if the small sample exhibits other (even possibly irrelevant) similarities with a broad population. This sort of error is called representativeness bias, and it holds that people commonly act as if a small sample is just as informative about a population as a large one. They therefore infer a pattern too quickly based on a small sample and extrapolate apparent trends too far into the future. It is easy to see how such a pattern would be consistent with momentum and reversal anomalies. A short-lived run of good earnings reports or high stock returns leads such investors to revise their assessments of likely future performance and thus generate buying pressure that exaggerates the price run-up. Eventually, the gap between price and intrinsic value becomes glaring and the market corrects its initial error. Interestingly, stocks with the best recent performance suffer reversals precisely in the few days surrounding management earnings forecasts or actual earnings announcements, suggesting that the correction occurs just as investors learn that their initial beliefs were too extreme.[9]

# Concept Check 12.1

We saw in Chapter 11 that stocks seem to exhibit a pattern of short- to middle-term momentum, along with long-term reversals. How might this pattern arise from an interplay between the conservatism and representativeness biases?

# Behavioral Biases

Even if information processing were perfect, many studies conclude that individuals would tend to make less-than-fully-rational decisions using that information. These behavioral biases largely affect how investors frame questions of risk versus return and, therefore, make risk-return trade-offs.

Framing Decisions seem to be affected by how choices are framed. For example, an individual may reject a bet when it is posed in terms of the risk surrounding possible gains but may accept that same bet when described in terms of the risk surrounding potential losses. In other words, individuals may act risk averse in terms of gains but risk seeking in terms of losses. But in many cases, the choice of how to frame a risky venture—as involving gains or losses—can be arbitrary.

# Example 12.1 Framing

Consider a coin toss with a payoff of  \$50 for tails. Now consider a gift of\$ 50 that is bundled with a bet that imposes a loss of \$50 if that coin toss comes up heads. In both cases, you end up with zero for heads and \$50 for tails. But the former description frames the coin toss as posing a risky gain, while the latter frames the coin toss in terms of a risky loss. The difference in framing can lead to different attitudes toward the risky payoff.

Mental Accounting Mental accounting is a specific form of framing in which people segregate certain decisions. For example, an investor may take a lot of risk with one investment account but establish a very conservative position with another account that is dedicated to her child's education. Rationally, it might be better to view both accounts as part of the investor's overall portfolio with the risk-return profiles of each integrated into a unified framework. Nevertheless, Shefrin and Statman point out that a central distinction between conventional and behavioral finance theory is that the behavioral approach views investors as building their portfolios in "distinct mental account layers in a pyramid of assets," where each layer may be tied to particular goals and elicit different levels of risk aversion.

In another paper, Shefrin and Statman argue that behavioral motives are consistent with some investors' irrational preference for stocks with high cash dividends (they feel free to spend dividend income but would not "dip into capital" by selling a few shares of another stock with the same total rate of return) and with a tendency to ride losing stock positions for too long (because "behavioral investors" are reluctant to realize losses). In fact, there is considerable evidence that investors are more prone to sell stocks with gains than those with losses, precisely contrary to a tax-minimization strategy. This reluctance to realize losses is called the disposition effect.

Mental accounting also can help explain momentum in stock prices. The house money effect refers to gamblers' greater willingness to accept new bets if they currently are ahead. They think of (i.e., frame) the bet as being made with their "winnings account," that is, with the casino's money rather than their own, and thus they are more willing to accept risk. Analogously, after a stock market run-up, individuals may view investments as largely funded out of a "capital gains account," become more tolerant of risk, discount future cash flows at a lower rate, and thus further push up prices.

Regret Avoidance Psychologists have found that individuals who make decisions that turn out badly have more regret (blame themselves more) when that decision was more unconventional. For example, buying a blue-chip portfolio that turns down is not as painful as experiencing the same losses on an unknown start-up firm. Any losses on the blue-chip stocks can be more easily attributed to bad luck rather than bad decision making and

cause less regret. De Bondt and Thaler argue that such regret avoidance is consistent with both the size and book-to-market effects. Higher book-to-market firms tend to have depressed stock prices. These firms are "out of favor" and more likely to be in a financially precarious position. Similarly, smaller, less well-known firms are also less conventional investments. Such firms require more "courage" on the part of the investor, which increases the required rate of return. Mental accounting can add to this effect. If investors focus on the gains or losses of individual stocks, rather than on broad portfolios, they can become more risk averse concerning stocks with recent poor performance, discount their cash flows at a higher rate, and thereby create a value-stock risk premium.

# Concept Check 12.2

How might the P/E effect (discussed in the previous chapter) also be explained as a consequence of regret avoidance?

Affect and Feelings Conventional models of portfolio choice focus on asset risk and return. But behavioral finance focuses as well on affect, which is a feeling of "good" or "bad" that consumers may attach to a potential purchase or investors to a stock. For example, firms with reputations for socially responsible policies or attractive working conditions or those producing popular products may generate higher affect in public perception. If investors favor stocks with good affect, that might drive up prices and drive down average rates of return. Statman, Fisher, and Anginer looked for evidence that affect influences security pricing. They found that stocks ranked high in Fortune's survey of most admired companies (i.e., with high affect) tend to have lower average risk-adjusted returns than the least admired firms, suggesting that their prices have been bid up relative to their underlying profitability, and, therefore, that their expected future returns are lower.

Affect might also be an explanation for the home country bias, the empirical tendency for investors to overweight shares in their home markets compared to an efficient diversification strategy. Psychologists have documented that people prefer familiar settings about which they feel like they have more information. Given this, they might well give up some diversification to focus on home markets where they subjectively perceive less uncertainty.

Prospect Theory Prospect theory modifies the analytic description of rational risk-averse investors found in standard financial theory.[15] Figure 12.1, Panel A, illustrates the conventional description of a risk-averse investor. Higher wealth provides higher satisfaction, or "utility," but at a diminishing rate (the curve flattens as the individual becomes wealthier). This gives rise to risk aversion: A gain of  \$1,000 increases utility by less than a loss of\$ 1,000 reduces it; therefore, investors will reject risky prospects that don't offer a risk premium.

B: Utility Function under Prospect Theory
Figure 12.1 Prospect theory. Panel A: A conventional utility function is defined in terms of wealth and is concave, resulting in risk aversion. Panel B: Under loss aversion, the utility function is defined in terms of losses relative to current wealth. It is also convex to the left of the origin, giving rise to risk-seeking behavior in terms of losses.

Figure 12.1, Panel B, shows a competing description of preferences characterized by "loss aversion." Utility depends not on the level of wealth, as in Panel A, but on changes in wealth from current levels. Moreover, to the left of zero (zero denotes no change from current wealth), the curve is convex rather than concave. This description of investor utility has several implications. Whereas many conventional utility functions imply that investors may become less risk averse as wealth increases, the function in Panel B always re-centers on current wealth, thereby ruling out such decreases in risk aversion and possibly helping to explain high average historical equity risk premiums. Moreover, the convex curvature to the left of the origin in Panel B will induce investors to be risk seeking rather than risk averse when it comes to losses. Consistent with loss aversion, traders in T-bond futures contracts have been observed to assume significantly greater risk in afternoon sessions following morning sessions in which they have lost money.[16]

# Limits to Arbitrage

Behavioral biases would not matter for stock pricing if rational arbitrageurs could fully exploit the mistakes of behavioral investors. Trades of profit-seeking investors would correct any misalignment between price and intrinsic value. However, behavioral advocates argue that, in practice, several factors limit the ability to profit from mispricing.[17]

Fundamental Risk Suppose that a share of Amazon is underpriced. Buying it may present a profit opportunity, but it is hardly risk-free because the presumed market underpricing can get worse. While price eventually should converge to intrinsic value, this may not happen until after the trader's investment horizon. For example, the investor may be

Some of the more influential references on limits to arbitrage are J. B. DeLong, A. Schleifer, L. Summers, and R. Waldmann, “Noise Trader Risk in Financial Markets,” Journal of Political Economy 98 (August 1990), pp. 704–38; and A. Schleifer and R. Vishny, “The Limits of Arbitrage,” Journal of Finance 52 (March 1997), pp. 35–55.

a mutual fund manager who may lose clients (not to mention a job!) if short-term performance is disappointing, or may be a trader whose portfolio can be decimated if investment performance is poor, even temporarily. A comment often attributed to the famous economist John Maynard Keynes is that "markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent." The fundamental risk incurred in exploiting apparent profit opportunities presumably will limit the activity of traders.

# Example 12.2 Fundamental Risk

In 2010, the NASDAQ index fluctuated at a level around 2,300. From that perspective, the value the index had reached in March 2000, around 5,000, seemed obviously crazy. Surely some investors living through the Internet "bubble" of the late 1990s must have identified the index as grossly overvalued, suggesting a good selling opportunity. But this hardly would have been a riskless arbitrage opportunity. Consider that NASDAQ may also have been "obviously" overvalued in January 2000 when it crossed above 4,000. An investor in January who believed that NASDAQ was overvalued at 4,000 and decided to sell it short would have suffered enormous losses as the index quickly increased by another 1,000 points before peaking in March. NASDAQ did finally crash, falling below 1,200 in late 2002. While one might have derived considerable satisfaction at eventually being proven right about the overpricing, by entering just a few months before the market "corrected," the investor might also have gone broke.

Implementation Costs Exploiting overpricing can be particularly difficult. Short-selling a security entails costs; short-sellers may have to return the borrowed security on little notice, rendering the horizon of the short sale uncertain. The cost of borrowing shares to initiate a short sale can fluctuate dramatically; sometimes, there are simply no shares available for borrowing, so it is not even possible to enter into a short sale. Other investors, such as many pension or mutual fund managers, face strict limits on their discretion to short securities. These impediments can limit the ability of arbitrage activity to force prices to fair value.

Model Risk One always has to worry that an apparent profit opportunity is more apparent than real. Perhaps you are using a faulty model to value the security, and the price actually is right. Mispricing may make a position a good bet, but it is still a risky one, which limits the extent to which it will be pursued.

# Limits to Arbitrage and the Law of One Price

While one can debate the implications of much of the anomalies literature, surely the Law of One Price (positing that effectively identical assets should have identical prices) should be satisfied in rational markets. Yet there are several instances where the law seems to have been violated. These instances are good case studies of the limits to arbitrage.

"Siamese Twin" Companies In 1907, Royal Dutch Petroleum and Shell Transport merged their operations into one firm. The two original companies, which continued to trade separately, agreed to split all profits from the joint company on a 60/40 basis. Shareholders of Royal Dutch receive  $60\%$  of the cash flow, and those of Shell receive  $40\%$ . One would therefore expect that Royal Dutch should sell for exactly  $60/40 = 1.5$  times the price of Shell. But this is not the case. Figure 12.2 shows that the relative value of the two firms has departed considerably from this "parity" ratio for extended periods of time.

Figure 12.2 Pricing of Royal Dutch relative to Shell (deviation from parity)

Source: O. A. Lamont and R. H. Thaler, "Anomalies: The Law of One Price in Financial Markets," Journal of Economic Perspectives 17 (Fall 2003), pp. 191-202. Figure 1, p. 196.

Doesn't this mispricing give rise to an arbitrage opportunity? If Royal Dutch sells for more than 1.5 times Shell, why not buy relatively underpriced Shell and short sell overpriced Royal? This seems like a reasonable strategy, but if you had followed it in February 1993 when Royal sold for about  $10\%$  more than its parity value, Figure 12.2 shows that you would have lost a lot of money as the premium widened to about  $17\%$  before finally reversing after 1999. As in Example 12.2, this opportunity posed fundamental risk.

Equity Carve-Outs Several equity carve-outs also have violated the Law of One Price.[19] To illustrate, consider the case of 3Com, which in 1999 decided to spin off its Palm division. It first sold  $5\%$  of its stake in Palm in an IPO, announcing that it would distribute the remaining  $95\%$  of its Palm shares to 3Com shareholders six months later in a spinoff. Each 3Com shareholder would receive 1.5 shares of Palm in the spinoff.

Once Palm shares began trading, but prior to the spinoff, the share price of 3Com should have been at least 1.5 times that of Palm. After all, each share of 3Com entitled its owner to 1.5 shares of Palm plus an ownership stake in a profitable company. Instead, Palm shares at the IPO actually sold for more than the 3Com shares. The stub value of 3Com (i.e., the value of each 3Com share net of the value of the claim to Palm represented by that share) could be computed as the price of 3Com minus 1.5 times the price of Palm. This calculation, however, implies that 3Com's stub value was negative, despite the fact that it was a profitable company with cash assets alone of about 10 per share.

Again, an arbitrage strategy seems obvious. Why not buy 3Com and sell Palm? The limit to arbitrage in this case was the inability of investors to sell Palm short. Virtually all available shares in Palm were already borrowed and sold short, and the negative stub values persisted for more than two months.

Closed-End Funds We noted in Chapter 4 that closed-end funds often sell for substantial discounts or premiums from net asset value. This is "nearly" a violation of the Law of One Price because one would expect the value of the fund to equal the value of the shares it holds. We say nearly because, in practice, there are a few wedges between the value of the closed-end fund and its underlying assets. One is expenses. The fund incurs expenses that ultimately are paid for by investors, and these will reduce share price. On the other hand, if managers can invest fund assets to generate positive risk-adjusted returns, share price might exceed net asset value.

Lee, Shleifer, and Thaler argue that the patterns of discounts and premiums on closed-end funds are driven by changes in investor sentiment. They note that discounts on various funds move together and are correlated with the return on small stocks, suggesting that all are affected by common variation in sentiment. One might consider buying funds selling at a discount from net asset value and selling those trading at a premium, but discounts and premiums can widen, subjecting this strategy to fundamental risk. Pontiff demonstrates that deviations of price from net asset value in closed-end funds tend to be higher in funds that are more difficult to arbitrage, for example, those with more idiosyncratic volatility.

However, closed-end fund discounts may also be examples of apparent anomalies that have alternative rational explanations. Ross points out that they can be reconciled with rational investors even if expenses or fund abnormal returns are modest.[22] He shows that if a fund has a dividend yield of  $\delta$ , an alpha (risk-adjusted abnormal return) of  $\alpha$ , and an expense ratio of  $\varepsilon$ , then using the constant-growth dividend discount model (see Chapter 18), the premium of the fund over its net asset value will be

$$
\frac {\text {P r i c e} - \text {N A V}}{\text {N A V}} = \frac {\alpha - \varepsilon}{\delta + \varepsilon - \alpha}
$$

If the fund manager's performance more than compensates for expenses (i.e., if  $\alpha > \varepsilon$ ), the fund will sell at a premium to NAV; otherwise, it will sell at a discount. For example, suppose  $\alpha = .015$ , the expense ratio is  $\varepsilon = .0125$ , and the dividend yield is  $\delta = .02$ . Then the premium will be .14, or  $14\%$ . But if the market turns sour on the manager and revises its estimate of  $\alpha$  downward to .005, that premium quickly turns into a discount of  $27\%$ .

This analysis might explain the pattern of premiums and discounts in closed-end funds; if investors expect a sufficiently large  $\alpha$ , they will purchase shares at a premium. But the fact that most premiums eventually turn into discounts indicates how difficult it is for management to fulfill these expectations.[23]

# Concept Check 12.3

Fundamental risk may be limited by a "deadline" that forces a convergence between price and intrinsic value. What do you think would happen to a closed-end fund's discount if the fund were to announce that it planned to liquidate in six months, at which time it would distribute NAV to its shareholders?

# Bubbles and Behavioral Economics

In Example 12.2, we pointed out that the stock market run-up of the late 1990s, and even more spectacularly, the run-up of the technology-heavy NASDAQ market, seems in retrospect to have been an obvious bubble. In a six-year period beginning in 1995, the NASDAQ index increased by a factor of more than 6. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan famously characterized the dot-com boom as an example of "irrational exuberance," and his assessment turned out to be correct: By October 2002, the index fell to less than one-fourth the peak value it had reached only  $2 \frac{1}{2}$  years earlier.

This episode seems to be a case in point for advocates of the behavioral school, exemplifying a market moved by irrational investor sentiment. Moreover, in accord with behavioral patterns, as the dot-com boom developed, it seemed to feed on itself, with investors increasingly confident of their investment prowess (overconfidence bias) and apparently willing to extrapolate short-term patterns into the distant future (representativeness bias).

Only five years later, another bubble, this time in housing prices, was underway. As in the dot-com bubble, prospects of further price increases fueled speculative demand by purchasers. Shortly thereafter, of course, housing prices stalled and then fell. The bursting bubble set off the worst financial crisis in 75 years.

Bubbles are a lot easier to identify as such once they are over. While they are going on, irrational exuberance is less obvious, and indeed, many financial commentators during the dot-com bubble justified the boom as consistent with glowing forecasts for the "new economy." A simple example shows how hard it can be to tie down the fair value of stock investments.[24]

# Example 12.3 A Stock Market Bubble?

In 2000, near the peak of the dot-com boom, the dividends paid by the firms included in the S&P 500 totaled \$154.6 million. If the discount rate for the index was  $9.2\%$  and the expected dividend growth rate was  $8\%$ , the value of these shares according to the constant-growth dividend discount model (see Chapter 18 for more on this model) would be

$$
\text {V a l u e} = \frac {\text {D i v i d e n d}}{\text {D i s c o u n t r a t e - G r o w t h r a t e}} = \frac {\mathbb {1 5 4 . 6}}{. 0 9 2 -. 0 8} = \mathbb {1 2 , 8 8 3 m i l l o n}
$$

This was quite close to the actual total value of those firms at the time. But the estimate is highly sensitive to the input values, and even a small reassessment of their prospects would result in a big revision of price. Suppose the expected dividend growth rate fell to  $7.4\%$ . This would reduce the value of the index to

$$
\text {V a l u e} = \frac {\text {D i v i d e n d}}{\text {D i s c o u n t r a t e - G r o w t h r a t e}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 5 4 . 6}{. 0 9 2 -. 0 7 4} = \mathbb {S} 8, 5 8 9 \text {m i l l i o n}
$$ which was about the value to which the S&P 500 firms had fallen by October 2002. In light of this example, the run-up and crash of the 1990s seem easier to reconcile with rational behavior.


Still, other evidence seems to tag the dot-com boom as at least partially irrational. Consider, for example, the results of a study documenting that firms adding “.com” to the end of their names during this period enjoyed a meaningful stock price increase.[25] That doesn’t sound like rational valuation.

# Evaluating the Behavioral Critique

As investors, we are concerned with the existence of profit opportunities. The behavioral explanations of efficient market anomalies do not always give guidance as to how to exploit any irrationality.

However, as we emphasized above, one of the important implications of the efficient market hypothesis is that security prices serve as reliable guides to the allocation of real assets. If prices are distorted, then capital markets will give misleading signals (and incentives) as to where the economy may best allocate resources. In this crucial dimension, the behavioral critique of the efficient market hypothesis is certainly important irrespective of any implication for investment strategies.

There is considerable debate among financial economists concerning behavioral finance. Many believe that it is too unstructured, allowing too many anomalies to be explained by some combination of irrationalities chosen from a laundry list of behavioral biases. While it is easy to "reverse engineer" a behavioral explanation for any particular anomaly, these critics would like to see a consistent or unified behavioral theory that can explain a range of behavioral anomalies.

More fundamentally, others are not convinced that the anomalies literature as a whole is a convincing indictment of the efficient market hypothesis. Fama notes that the anomalies are inconsistent in terms of their support for one type of irrationality versus another. For example, some papers document long-term corrections (consistent with overreaction), while others document long-term continuations of abnormal returns (consistent with underreaction). Moreover, the statistical significance of many of these results is hard to assess. Even small errors in choosing a benchmark against which to compare returns can cumulate to large apparent abnormalities in long-term returns.

The behavioral critique of full rationality in investor decision making is well taken, but the extent to which limited rationality affects asset pricing remains controversial. Whether or not investor irrationality affects asset prices, however, behavioral finance already makes important points about portfolio management. Investors who are aware of the potential pitfalls in information processing and decision making that seem to characterize their peers should be better able to avoid such errors. Ironically, the insights of behavioral finance may lead to some of the same policy conclusions embraced by efficient market advocates. For example, an easy way to avoid some of the behavioral minefields is to pursue passive, largely indexed, portfolio strategies. It seems that only rare individuals can consistently beat passive strategies; this conclusion may hold true whether your fellow investors are behavioral or rational.

# 12.2 Technical Analysis and Behavioral Finance

Technical analysis attempts to exploit recurring and predictable patterns in stock prices to generate superior investment performance. Technicians do not deny the value of fundamental information, but they believe that prices only gradually close in on intrinsic value. As fundamentals shift, astute traders can exploit the adjustment to a new equilibrium.

For example, one of the best-documented behavioral tendencies is the disposition effect, which refers to the tendency of investors to hold on to losing investments. Until the stock is sold and the loss is realized, the investor perceives only a "paper loss," which is more easily ignored. This disposition effect can lead to momentum in stock prices even if fundamental values follow a random walk.[27] The fact that the demand of "disposition investors" for a company's shares depends on the price history of those shares means that prices could close in on fundamental values only over time, consistent with the central motivation of technical analysis.

Behavioral biases may also be consistent with technical analysts' use of volume data. An important behavioral trait noted above is overconfidence, a systematic tendency to overestimate one's abilities. As traders become overconfident, they may trade more, inducing an association between trading volume and market returns.[28] Technical analysis thus uses volume data as well as price history to direct trading strategy.

Finally, technicians believe that market fundamentals can be perturbed by irrational or behavioral factors, sometimes labeled sentiment variables. More or less random price fluctuations will accompany any underlying price trend, creating opportunities to exploit corrections as these fluctuations dissipate. For example, we noted earlier that behavioral biases, for example confirmation bias, have the potential to generate some of the patterns that technical analysts claim actually characterize price patterns.

# Trends and Corrections

Much of technical analysis seeks to uncover trends in market prices. This is in effect a search for momentum. Momentum can be absolute, in which case one searches for upward price trends, or relative, in which case the analyst looks to invest in one sector over another (or even take on a long-short position in the two sectors). Relative strength statistics are designed to uncover these potential opportunities.

Momentum and Moving Averages While we all would like to buy shares in firms whose prices are trending upward, this begs the question of how to identify the underlying direction of prices, if in fact such trends actually exist. A popular tool used for this purpose is the moving average.

The moving average of a stock price is the average price over a given interval, where that interval is updated as time passes. For example, a 25-day moving average traces the average price over the previous 25 days. The average is recomputed each day by dropping

the oldest observation and adding the newest. Figure 12.3 is a moving average chart for Intel. Notice that the moving average (the solid red curve) is a "smoothed" version of the original data series (the dashed blue curve).

After a period in which prices have been falling, the moving average will be above the current price (because the moving average continues to average in the older and higher prices until they leave the sample period). In contrast, when prices have been rising, the moving average will be below the current price.

Prices breaking through the moving average from below, as at point A in Figure 12.3, are taken as a bullish signal because this signifies a shift from a falling trend (with prices below the moving average) to a rising trend (with prices above the moving average). Conversely, when prices drop below the moving average, as at point B, analysts might conclude that market momentum has become negative.

# Example 12.4 Moving Averages

Consider the following price data. Each observation represents the closing level of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) on the last trading day of the week. The 5-week moving average for each week is the average of the DJIA over the previous 5 weeks. For example, the first entry, for week 5, is the average of the index value between weeks 1 and 5: 34,290, 34,380, 34,399, 34,379, and 34,450. The next entry is the average of the index values between weeks 2 and 6, and so on.

<table><tr><td>Week</td><td>DJIA</td><td>5-Week Moving Average</td><td>Week</td><td>DJIA</td><td>5-Week Moving Average</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>34,290</td><td></td><td>11</td><td>34,590</td><td>34,555</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>34,380</td><td></td><td>12</td><td>34,652</td><td>34,586</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>34,399</td><td></td><td>13</td><td>34,625</td><td>34,598</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>34,379</td><td></td><td>14</td><td>34,657</td><td>34,624</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>34,450</td><td>34,380</td><td>15</td><td>34,699</td><td>34,645</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>34,513</td><td>34,424</td><td>16</td><td>34,647</td><td>34,656</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>34,500</td><td>34,448</td><td>17</td><td>34,610</td><td>34,648</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>34,565</td><td>34,481</td><td>18</td><td>34,595</td><td>34,642</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>34,524</td><td>34,510</td><td>19</td><td>34,499</td><td>34,610</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>34,597</td><td>34,540</td><td>20</td><td>34,466</td><td>34,563</td></tr></table>

Figure 12.4 plots the level of the index and the 5-week moving average. Notice that while the index itself moves up and down rather abruptly, the moving average is a relatively smooth series because the impact of each week's price movement is averaged with that of the previous weeks. Week 16 is a bearish point according to the moving average rule. The price series crosses from above the moving average to below it, signifying the beginning of a downward trend in stock prices.

Other techniques also are used to uncover potential momentum in stock prices. Two of the more famous ones are Elliott wave theory and Kondratieff waves. Both posit the existence of long-term trends in stock market prices that may be disturbed by shorter-term trends as well as daily fluctuations of little importance. Elliott wave theory superimposes long-term and short-term wave cycles in an attempt to describe the complicated pattern of actual price movements. Once the longer-term waves are identified, investors presumably can buy when the long-term direction of the market is positive. While there is considerable noise in the actual evolution of stock prices, by properly interpreting the wave cycles, one can, according to the theory, predict broad movements.

Similarly, Kondratieff waves are named after a Russian economist who asserted that the macroeconomy (and therefore the stock market) moves in broad waves lasting between 48 and 60 years. Kondratieff's assertion is hard to evaluate empirically, however, because cycles that last about 50 years provide only two independent observations per century, which is hardly enough data to test the predictive power of the theory.

Relative Strength Relative strength measures the extent to which a security has outperformed or underperformed either the market as a whole or its particular industry. Relative strength is computed by calculating the ratio of the price of the security to a price index for the industry. For example, the relative strength of Toyota versus the auto industry would be measured by movements in the ratio of the price of Toyota divided by the level of an auto industry index. A rising ratio implies Toyota has been outperforming the rest of the industry. If relative strength can be assumed to persist over time, then this would be a signal to buy Toyota.

Similarly, the strength of an industry relative to the whole market can be computed by tracking the ratio of the industry price index to the market price index.

Breadth The breadth of the market is a measure of the extent to which movement in a market index is reflected widely in the price movements of all the stocks in the market. The most common measure of breadth is the spread between the number of stocks that advance and decline in price. If advances outnumber declines by a wide margin, then the market is viewed as being stronger because the rally is widespread. These numbers are reported in The Wall Street Journal (see Figure 12.5).

Some analysts cumulate breadth data each day as in Table 12.1. The cumulative breadth for each day is obtained by adding that day's net advances (or declines) to the previous day's total. The direction of the cumulated series is then used to discern broad market trends. Analysts might use a moving average of cumulative breadth to gauge broad trends.

<table><tr><td>Day</td><td>Advances</td><td>Declines</td><td>Net Advances</td><td>Cumulative Breadth</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1,302</td><td>1,248</td><td>54</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1,417</td><td>1,140</td><td>277</td><td>331</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1,203</td><td>1,272</td><td>-69</td><td>262</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1,012</td><td>1,622</td><td>-610</td><td>-348</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>1,133</td><td>1,504</td><td>-371</td><td>-719</td></tr></table>

Note: The sum of advances plus declines varies across days because some stock prices are unchanged.

# Machine Learning and Technical Analysis

Machine learning is not commonly classified as a form of technical analysis. But if one defines technical analysis as the use of past patterns in prices (and other trading data) to forecast profitable trades going forward, then one can make the case that they are at the very least related. In this regard, it is worth looking at one of the most successful hedge funds in history, Renaissance Technologies. Its signature Medallion fund generated average annual returns (before fees) as high as  $66\%$  per year between 1988 and 2018.[29] Even after fees, its very fortunate investors enjoyed average returns of  $39\%$ .

Renaissance is notoriously secretive about the details of its trading strategies. But it appears that they are driven in part by techniques that, at least in concept, would feel familiar to a technical analyst. Think about a simple pairs trade as an example. In this strategy, if prices of two stocks that typically move together (e.g., Coke and Pepsi) begin to diverge, one might buy the stock that has fared relatively poorly and sell the better-performing firm, wagering that the performance discrepancy will reverse. This is a version of a classic correction strategy from the technical analysis tool kit. It searches for possibly slight price misalignments that on average tend to dissipate.

Renaissance appears to have put this approach on steroids. The firm collects unimaginable amounts of data, not just on past pricing, but also on the widest variety of economic indicators. The data are fed into machine learning programs that are trained to tease out even the slightest signals of misalignment in security prices. The relations uncovered are generally multi-dimensional and beyond the ability of a human to detect in real time. As in pairs trading, Renaissance avoids outright bets on the direction of price movements, which it seems to view as a fool's errand, and focuses instead on relative performance among pairs or, more generally, clusters of firms. These strategies, which are designed to profit regardless of market performance, are therefore referred to as market neutral.

Does Renaissance's incredible success validate technical analysis and thus invalidate efficient markets? That may depend in part on your standards. The firm acknowledges that each of its "bets" are right barely more than  $50\%$  of the time. Market prices are indeed hard to predict; in this sense, Renaissance's experience validates efficient markets as a very good first approximation to reality. But with very low trading costs and very frequent trades, even tiny profits can accumulate to eye-popping performance. Still, it would be a wild understatement to point out that few traders can bring to bear the analytic and trading expertise that Renaissance has developed. Nevertheless, the success of this approach has encouraged the growth of a large group of quantitative hedge funds that similarly follow market-neutral approaches.

# Sentiment Indicators

Behavioral finance devotes considerable attention to market sentiment, which may be interpreted as the general level of optimism among investors. Technical analysts have devised several measures of sentiment; we review a few of them.

Trin Statistic Trading volume is sometimes used to measure the strength of a market rise or fall. Technicians consider market advances to be a more favorable omen of continued price increases when they are associated with increased trading volume. Similarly, market reversals are considered more bearish when associated with higher volume. The trin statistic is defined as

$$
\mathrm {T r i n} = \frac {\text {V o l u m e d e c l i n i n g / N u m b e r d e c l i n i n g}}{\text {V o l u m e a v a n c i n g / N u m b e r a v a n c i n g}}
$$

Therefore, trin is the ratio of average volume in declining issues to average volume in advancing issues. Ratios above 1.0 are considered bearish because the falling stocks would then have higher average volume than the advancing stocks, indicating net selling pressure. The Wall Street Journal Online provides the data necessary to compute trin in its Markets Diary section. Using the data in Figure 12.5, trin for the NYSE on this day was:

$$
\operatorname {T r i n} = \frac {2 6 5 . 7 / 6 6 3}{1 , 1 2 7 . 8 / 2 , 7 4 4} = 1. 0 2
$$

Remember, however, that for every buyer, there must be a seller of stock. Rising volume in a rising market should not necessarily indicate a larger imbalance of buyers versus sellers. For example, a trin statistic above 1.0, which is considered bearish, could equally well be interpreted as indicating that there is more buying activity in declining issues.

Confidence Index Barron's computes a confidence index using data from the bond market. The presumption is that actions of bond traders reveal trends that will emerge soon in the stock market.

The confidence index is the ratio of the average yield on 10 top-rated corporate bonds divided by the average yield on 10 intermediate-grade corporate bonds. The ratio will always be below 1 because higher-rated bonds will offer lower promised yields to maturity. When bond traders are optimistic about the economy, however, they might require smaller default premiums on lower-rated debt. Hence, the yield spread will narrow, and the confidence index will approach 1. Therefore, higher values of the confidence index are bullish signals.

# Concept Check 12.4

Yields on lower-rated debt will rise after fears of recession have spread through the economy. This will reduce the confidence index. Should the stock market now be expected to fall, or will it already have fallen?

Short Interest Short interest is the total number of shares of stock currently sold short. The common, bearish interpretation of short interest is based on the fact that short-sellers tend to be larger, more sophisticated investors. Accordingly, increased short interest reflects negative sentiment by the "smart money," which would be a warning sign concerning the stock's prospects.

A less-common, bullish perspective is that, because all short sales must be covered (i.e., short-sellers eventually must purchase shares to return the ones they have borrowed), short interest represents latent future demand for the stocks. As short sales are covered, the demand created by the share purchase will push prices up.

Put/Call Ratio Call options give investors the right to buy a stock at a fixed "exercise" price and therefore are a way of betting on stock price increases. Put options give the right to sell a stock at a fixed price and therefore are a way of betting on stock price decreases.[30] The ratio of outstanding put options to outstanding call options is called the put/call ratio. Typically, the put/call ratio hovers around  $65\%$ . Because put options do well in falling markets while call options do well in rising markets, a rising ratio is taken as a sign of broad investor pessimism and a coming market decline.

# A Warning

The search for patterns in stock market prices is nearly irresistible, and the ability of the human eye to discern apparent patterns is remarkable. In fact, susceptibility to pattern recognition was one of the information processing errors we pointed out in Section 12.1. Unfortunately, it is possible to perceive patterns that really don't exist.

Consider Figure 12.6, which presents simulated and actual values of the Dow Jones Industrial Average during 1956 taken from a famous study by Harry Roberts.[31] In Figure 12.6, Panel B, the market appears to present a classic head-and-shoulders pattern where the middle hump (the head) is flanked by two shoulders. When the price index "pierces the right shoulder"—a technical trigger point—it is believed to be heading lower, and it is time to sell your stocks. Figure 12.6, Panel A also looks like a "typical" stock market pattern.

However, one of these panels was generated using "returns" created by a random-number generator and by construction were patternless. Can you tell which of the two graphs is constructed from the real value of the Dow and which from the simulated data?32

Figure 12.7 shows the weekly price changes behind the two panels in Figure 12.6. Here the randomness in both series—the stock price as well as the simulated sequence—is obvious.

A problem related to the tendency to perceive patterns where they don't exist is data mining. After the fact, you can always find patterns and trading rules that would have generated enormous profits. If you test enough rules, some will have worked in the past. Unfortunately, picking a theory that would have worked after the fact carries no guarantee of future success.

In evaluating trading rules, you should always ask whether the rule would have seemed reasonable before you looked at the data. If not, you might be buying into the one arbitrary rule among many that happened to have worked in that particular sample. The crucial question is whether there is reason to believe that what worked in the past should continue to work in the future.

1. Behavioral finance focuses on systematic irrationalities that characterize investor decision making. These "behavioral shortcomings" may be consistent with several efficient market anomalies.
2. Among the information processing errors uncovered in the psychology literature are heuristic decisions, overconfidence, conservatism, confirmation bias, and representativeness. Behavioral tendencies include framing, mental accounting, regret avoidance, and loss aversion.
3. Limits to arbitrage activity impede the ability of rational investors to exploit pricing errors induced by behavioral investors. For example, fundamental risk means that even if a security is mispriced, it still can be risky to attempt to exploit the mispricing. This limits the actions of arbitrageurs who take positions in mispriced securities. Other limits to arbitrage are implementation costs, model risk, and costs to short-selling. Occasional failures of the Law of One Price suggest that limits to arbitrage are sometimes severe.
4. The various limits to arbitrage mean that even if prices do not equal intrinsic value, it still may be difficult to exploit the mispricing. As a result, the failure of traders to beat the market may not be proof that markets are actually efficient, with prices equal to intrinsic value.
5. Technical analysis is the search for recurring and predictable patterns in stock prices. It is based on the premise that prices only gradually close in on intrinsic value. As fundamentals shift, astute traders can exploit the adjustment to a new equilibrium.
6. Technical analysis also uses volume data and sentiment indicators. These are broadly consistent with several behavioral models of investor activity. Moving averages, relative strength, and breadth are used in other trend-based strategies.
7. Some sentiment indicators are the trin statistic, the confidence index, short interest, and the put/ call ratio.

# PROBLEM SETS

1. Explain how some of the behavioral biases discussed in the chapter might contribute to the success of technical trading rules.
2. Why would an advocate of the efficient market hypothesis believe that even if many investors exhibit the behavioral biases discussed in the chapter, security prices might still be set efficiently?
3. What sorts of factors might limit the ability of rational investors to take advantage of any "pricing errors" that result from the actions of "behavioral investors"?
4. Even if behavioral biases do not affect equilibrium asset prices, why might it still be important for investors to be aware of them?
5. Some advocates of behavioral finance agree with efficient market advocates that indexing is the optimal investment strategy for most investors. But their reasons for this conclusion differ greatly. Compare and contrast the rationale for indexing according to both of these schools of thought.

I prefer to be conservative and to minimize losses, even if I miss out on substantial growth opportunities.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>All nongovernmental investments should be in industry-leading and financially strong companies.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Income needs should be met entirely through interest income and cash dividends. All equity securities held should pay cash dividends.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Investment decisions should be based primarily on consensus forecasts of general economic conditions and company-specific growth.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>If an investment falls below the purchase price, that security should be retained until it returns to its original cost. Conversely, I prefer to take quick profits on successful investments.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>I will direct the purchase of investments, including derivative securities, periodically. These aggressive investments result from personal research and may not prove consistent with my investment policy. I have not kept records on the performance of similar past investments, but I have had some “big winners.”</td></tr></table>

2. Monty Frost's tax-deferred retirement account is invested entirely in equity securities. Because the international portion of his portfolio has performed poorly in the past, he has reduced his international equity exposure to  $2\%$ . Frost's investment adviser has recommended an increased international equity exposure. Frost responds with the following comments: a. "On the basis of past poor performance, I want to sell all my remaining international equity securities once their market prices rise to equal their original cost."


b. "Most diversified international portfolios have had disappointing results over the past five years. During that time, however, the market in Country XYZ has outperformed all other markets, even our own. If I do increase my international equity exposure, I would prefer that the entire exposure consists of securities from Country XYZ."
c. "International investments are inherently more risky. Therefore, I prefer to purchase any international equity securities in my 'speculative' account, my best chance at becoming rich. I do not want them in my retirement account, which has to protect me from poverty in my old age."

Frost's adviser is familiar with behavioral finance concepts but prefers a traditional or standard finance approach (modern portfolio theory) to investments.

Indicate the behavioral finance concept that Frost most directly exhibits in each of his three comments. Explain how each of Frost's comments can be countered by using an argument from standard finance.

3. Louise and Christopher Maclin live in the U.K. and currently rent an apartment in London's metropolitan area. During an initial discussion of the Maclins' financial plans, Christopher Maclin makes the following statements to the Maclins' financial adviser, Grant Webb: a. "I have used the Internet extensively to research the outlook for the housing market over the next five years, and I believe now is the best time to buy a house."

b. "I do not want to sell any bond in my portfolio for a lower price than I paid for the bond."
c. "I will not sell any of my company stock because I know my company and I believe it has excellent prospects for the future."

For each statement  $(a) - (c)$  identify the behavioral finance concept most directly exhibited. Explain how each behavioral finance concept is affecting Maclin's investment decision making.

4. During an interview with her investment adviser, a retired investor made the following two statements: a. "I have been very pleased with the returns I've earned on Petrie stock over the past two years and I am certain that it will be a superior performer in the future."

b. "I am pleased with the returns from the Petrie stock because I have specific uses for that money. For that reason, I certainly want my retirement fund to continue owning the Petrie stock."

Identify which principle of behavioral finance is most consistent with each of the investor's two statements.

5. Claire Pierce comments on her life circumstances and investment outlook:

I must support my parents who live overseas on Pogo Island. The Pogo Island economy has grown rapidly over the past 2 years with minimal inflation, and consensus forecasts call for a continuation of these favorable trends for the foreseeable future. Economic growth has resulted from the export of a natural resource used in an exciting new technology application.

I want to invest  $10\%$  of my portfolio in Pogo Island government bonds. I plan to purchase long-term bonds because my parents are likely to live more than 10 years. Experts uniformly do not foresee a resurgence of inflation on Pogo Island, so I am certain that the total returns produced by the bonds will cover my parents' spending needs for many years to come. There should be no exchange rate risk because the bonds are denominated in local currency. I want to buy the Pogo Island bonds, but am not willing to distort my portfolio's long-term asset allocation to do so. The overall mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments should not change. Therefore, I am considering selling one of my U.S. bond funds to raise cash to buy the Pogo Island bonds. One possibility is my High Yield Bond Fund, which has declined  $5\%$  in value year to date. I am not excited about this fund's prospects; in fact, I think it is likely to decline more, but there is a small probability that it could recover very quickly. So I have decided instead to sell my Core Bond Fund that has appreciated  $5\%$  this year. I expect this investment to continue to deliver attractive returns, but there is a small chance this year's gains might disappear quickly.

Once that shift is accomplished, my investments will be in great shape. The sole exception is my Small Company Fund, which has performed poorly. I plan to sell this investment as soon as the price increases to my original cost.

Identify three behavioral finance concepts illustrated in Pierce's comments and describe each of the three concepts. Discuss how an investor practicing standard or traditional finance would challenge each of the three concepts.

# E-INVESTMENTS EXERCISES

1. Log on to finance.yahoo.com to find the monthly dividend-adjusted closing prices for the most recent 4 years for Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF). Also collect the closing level of the S&P 500 Index over the same period.

a. Calculate the 4-month moving average of both the stock and the S&P 500 over time. For each series, use Excel to plot the moving average against the actual level of the stock price or index. Examine the instances where the moving average and price series cross. Is the stock more or less likely to increase when the price crosses through the moving average? Does it matter whether the price crosses the moving average from above or below? How reliable would an investment rule based on moving averages be? Perform your analysis for both the stock price and the S&P 500.
b. Calculate and plot the relative strength of the stock compared to the S&P 500 over the sample period. Find all instances in which relative strength of the stock increases by more than 10 percentage points (e.g., an increase in the relative strength index from .93 to 1.03) and all those instances in which relative strength of the stock decreases by more than 10 percentage points. Is the stock more or less likely to outperform (underperform) the S&P 500 in the following two months when relative strength has increased (decreased)? In other words, does relative strength continue? How reliable would an investment rule based on relative strength be?

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. Conservatism implies that investors will at first respond too slowly to new information, leading to trends in prices. Representativeness can lead them to extrapolate trends too far into the future and overshoot intrinsic value. Eventually, when the pricing error is corrected, we observe a reversal.
2. Out-of-favor stocks will exhibit low prices relative to various proxies for intrinsic value such as earnings. Because of regret avoidance, these stocks will need to offer a more attractive rate of return to induce investors to hold them. Thus, low P/E stocks might on average offer higher rates of return.

3. At liquidation, price will equal NAV. This puts a limit on fundamental risk. Investors need only carry the position for a few months to profit from the elimination of the discount. Moreover, as the liquidation date approaches, the discount should dissipate. This greatly limits the risk that the discount can move against the investor. At the announcement of impending liquidation, the discount should immediately disappear, or at least shrink considerably.
4. By the time the news of the recession affects bond yields, it also ought to affect stock prices. The market should fall before the confidence index signals that the time is ripe to sell.

# Empirical Evidence on Security Returns

# 13

WHY DO DIFFERENT securities offer different expected rates of return? According to the simple CAPM, one thing and only one thing matters: the systematic risk of the security as measured by its beta. Other measures of risk such as firm-specific volatility should be irrelevant, and expected rates of return should rise in direct proportion to beta.

Early tests of the risk-return relationship focused on these stark implications of the model. The results, as we will see shortly, were ambiguous at best. However, further reflection made it clear that it would be almost impossible to conduct a definitive test of the CAPM, in large part because it is so tied to an inherently unobservable market portfolio encompassing all assets. Accounting for nontraded assets such as human capital could substantially affect the predicted risk-return trade-off.

Moreover, variants on the CAPM came swiftly on the heels of the simple one-factor model. These richer models suggested that the risk-return relationship might entail multiple sources of systematic risk. For example, uncertainty about future interest rates or prices of major consumption goods or asset-return volatility could also generate equilibrium risk premia. This implies that we really ought to be testing a multifactor SML.

In addition, non-risk-related considerations such as liquidity costs surrounding security trading also can lead to substantial variation in expected returns. Finally, behavioral-finance issues can potentially lead to security mispricing and dispersion in expected returns.

These many issues present a long agenda for empirical testing of the risk-return relationship. We have space to provide only a brief overview of this vast literature. We begin with tests of the single-factor security market line, the theater where many of the basic methodologies still used today were developed. We proceed to multifactor models, especially the Fama-French three-factor model and its many variants, which have become the workhorse models for current empirical research. But we also discuss how a dramatic increase in the number of proposed risk factors has created a "factor zoo" that calls into question the validity of many of these findings. We also show how liquidity issues appear to generate variation in expected returns across securities that are roughly as large as those due to differences in risk. Finally, we examine the empirical implications of consumption-based models such as Merton's intertemporal CAPM and the consumption CAPM.

# 13.1 Two-Pass Tests of Asset Pricing

The key prediction of most theories of asset pricing is that expected returns should rise along with exposure to systematic risk. In the simple CAPM, that exposure is measured by beta. Tests of this hypothesis commonly use a two-pass methodology. First, use a time series of returns to estimate systematic risk (beta). Next, given that risk assessment, use a cross-section of assets to test whether riskier assets have, in fact, provided higher average returns. We will illustrate this methodology using tests of the single-factor CAPM. Tests of more complicated models are typically generalizations of the approach illustrated here.

# Testing the Single-Factor SML

Recall that if the expected return-beta relationship holds with respect to an observable ex ante efficient index,  $M$ , the expected rate of return on any security  $i$  is

$$
E \left(r _ {i}\right) = r _ {f} + \beta_ {i} \left[ E \left(r _ {M}\right) - r _ {f} \right] \tag {13.1}
$$ where  $\beta_{i}$  is defined as  $\mathrm{Cov}(r_i,r_M) / \sigma_M^2$


Equation 13.1 tells us that expected return increases along with beta. Therefore, early tests of the CAPM were conducted along the following lines: Collect data on the rates of return on a large sample of stocks as well as the market index and risk-free rate, use those data to estimate the beta of each stock from an index model regression (like the one we employed in Chapter 8), and then test to see whether stocks with high betas have in fact provided higher average returns.

Setting Up the Sample Data Determine a sample period of, for example, 60 monthly holding periods. For each month, collect the rates of return on a large number of stocks, for example, 100; a market portfolio proxy (e.g., the CRSP market index); and 1-month (risk-free) T-bills. Your data thus consist of

$$
\begin{array}{l} \begin{array}{l} r _ {i t} = 6, 0 0 0 \text {r e t u r n s o n t h e 1 0 0 s t o c k s o v e r t h e 6 0 - m o n t h s a m p l e p e r i o d ;} i = 1, \ldots , 1 0 0, \\ \text {a n d} t = 1, \ldots , 6 0. \end{array} \\ r _ {M t} = 6 0 \text {o b s e r v a t i o n s o f t h e r e t u r n s o n t h e C R S P i n d e x o r d e r t h e s a m p l e p e r i o d} (\text {o n e e a c h m o n t h}). \\ r _ {f t} = 6 0 \text {o b s e r v a t i o n s o f t h e r i s k - f r e e r a t e (o n e e a c h m o n t h)}. \\ \end{array}
$$

This constitutes a table of  $102 \times 60 = 6,120$  rates of return.

Estimating the SCL View Equation 13.1 as a security characteristic line (SCL), as in Chapter 8. You want to estimate how the return on each stock responds to the return on the market index. Therefore, for each stock,  $i$ , you estimate the beta coefficient as the slope of a first-pass regression equation. (The terminology first-pass regression reflects the fact that the estimated coefficients will be used as input into a second-pass regression.)

$$ r _ {i t} - r _ {f t} = a _ {i} + b _ {i} (r _ {M t} - r _ {f t}) + e _ {i t}
$$

You will use the following statistics in later analysis:

$\overline{r_i - r_f} =$  Sample averages (over the 60 months) of the excess return on each of the 100 stocks.

$b_{i} =$  Sample estimates of the beta coefficients of each of the 100 stocks.

$\overline{r_M - r_f} =$  Sample average of the excess return of the market index.

$\sigma^2 (e_i) =$  Estimates of the variance of the residuals for each of the 100 stocks.

The sample average excess returns on each stock and the market portfolio are taken as estimates of expected excess returns, and the values of  $b_{i}$  are estimates of the true beta coefficients for the 100 stocks during the sample period.  $\sigma^2 (e_i)$  estimates the nonsystematic risk of each of the 100 stocks. It is understood that all these statistics are subject to estimation error.

# Concept Check 13.1 a. How many regression estimates of the SCL do we have from the sample?

b. How many observations are there in each of the regressions?
c. According to the CAPM, what should be the average value of the intercept in these regressions?

Estimating the SML Now view Equation 13.1 as a security market line (SML) with 100 observations for the stocks in your sample. Given the estimate of beta from the first pass, we now ask: To what extent does average return increase as beta increases? Therefore, you estimate  $\gamma_0$  and  $\gamma_{1}$  in the following second-pass regression equation with the estimates of beta,  $b_{i}$ , as the explanatory variable:

$$
\overline {{r _ {i} - r _ {f}}} = \gamma_ {0} + \gamma_ {1} b _ {i} \quad i = 1, \dots , 1 0 0 \tag {13.2}
$$

Comparing Equations 13.1 and 13.2, we see that the CAPM predicts that  $\gamma_0$  and  $\gamma_{1}$  are

$$
\gamma_ {0} = 0 \mathrm {a n d} \gamma_ {1} = \overline {{r _ {M} - r _ {f}}}
$$

In fact, you can go a step further and argue that the key property of the expected return-beta relationship described by the SML is that the expected excess return on securities is determined only by systematic risk (as measured by beta) and should be independent of nonsystematic risk, as measured by the variance of the residuals,  $\sigma^2(e_i)$ , which also were estimated from the first-pass regression. These estimates can be added as a variable in Equation 13.2 of an expanded SML that now looks like this:

$$
\overline {{r _ {i} - r _ {f}}} = \gamma_ {0} + \gamma_ {1} b _ {i} + \gamma_ {2} \sigma^ {2} \left(e _ {i}\right) \tag {13.3}
$$

This second-pass regression equation is estimated with the hypotheses

$$
\gamma_ {0} = 0; \gamma_ {1} = \overline {{r _ {M} - r _ {f}}}; \gamma_ {2} = 0
$$

The hypothesis that  $\gamma_{2} = 0$  is consistent with the notion that nonsystematic risk should not be "priced," that is, that there is no risk premium earned for bearing nonsystematic risk.

More generally, according to the CAPM, the risk premium depends only on beta. Therefore, any additional right-hand-side variable in Equation 13.3 beyond beta should have a coefficient that is insignificantly different from zero in the second-pass regression.

The two-stage procedure (i.e., first estimate security betas using a time-series regression and then use those betas to test the SML relationship between risk and average return) seems straightforward. However, it turns out that there are several difficulties with this approach. First and foremost, stock returns are extremely volatile, which lessens the precision of any tests of average return. For example, the average standard deviation of annual returns of even the large stocks in the S&P 500 exceeds  $30\%$ .

In addition, there are fundamental concerns about the validity of these tests. First, the market index they employ is surely not the "market portfolio" of the CAPM. The stock market is far from a complete portfolio of investor wealth. First, the U.S. stock market comprises only about  $40\%$  of world equity value. More importantly, an exclusive focus on equity excludes important asset classes such as real estate, private business enterprises, commodities, or human capital, which collectively have far greater value than the equity market.

Second, in light of asset volatility, the security betas from the first-stage regressions are necessarily estimated with substantial sampling error and therefore cannot readily be used as inputs to the second-stage regression. (If you look back at Chapter 8, Table 8.2, you will see that the average standard error of the estimate of beta even for our sample of large firms was .26. With that level of imprecision, a stock estimated to have a beta of 1.0 would have a two-standard-deviation confidence interval ranging all the way from .48 to 1.52!) It is well known in statistics that if the right-hand-side variable of a regression equation is measured with error (in our case, beta is measured with error and is the right-hand-side variable in the second-pass regression), then the slope coefficient of the regression equation will be biased downward and the intercept biased upward.

Finally, investors cannot borrow at the risk-free rate, as assumed by the simple version of the CAPM. Let us investigate the implications of these problems in turn.

# The Market Index

In what has come to be known as Roll's critique, Richard Roll demonstrated that:

1. There is a single testable hypothesis associated with the CAPM: The market portfolio is mean-variance efficient.
2. All the other implications of the model, the best-known being the linear relation between expected return and beta, follow from the market portfolio's efficiency and therefore are not independently testable. There is an "if and only if" relation between the expected return-beta relationship and the efficiency of the market portfolio.
3. In any sample of observations of individual returns, there will be an infinite number of ex post (i.e., after the fact) mean-variance efficient portfolios using the sample-period returns and covariances (as opposed to the ex ante expected returns and covariances). Sample betas of individual assets estimated against each such ex-post efficient portfolio will be exactly linearly related to the sample average returns of these assets. In other words, if betas are calculated against such portfolios, they will satisfy the SML relation exactly whether or not the true market portfolio was mean-variance efficient in an ex ante sense.


4. The CAPM is not testable unless we know the exact composition of the true market portfolio and use it in the tests. This implies that the theory is not testable unless all assets are included in the sample.
5. Using a proxy such as the CRSP index for the market portfolio is subject to two difficulties. First, the proxy itself might be mean-variance efficient even when the true market portfolio is not. More likely, the proxy may turn out to be inefficient, but obviously, this alone implies nothing about the true market portfolio's efficiency. Furthermore, most market proxies will be highly diversified and therefore highly correlated with each other as well as with the true market portfolio whether or not they are mean-variance efficient. Such a high degree of correlation will make it seem that the exact composition of the market portfolio is unimportant, but the use of different proxies can lead to quite different conclusions. This problem is referred to as benchmark error because it refers to the use of an incorrect benchmark (market proxy) portfolio in the tests of the theory.

Roll and Ross $^{2}$  and Kandel and Stambaugh $^{3}$  expanded Roll's critique. Essentially, they argued that tests that reject a positive relationship between average return and beta point to inefficiency of the market proxy used in those tests, rather than refuting the theoretical expected return-beta relationship. Importantly, they demonstrate that even if the CAPM is true, even highly diversified portfolios, such as the value- or equally weighted portfolios of all stocks in the sample, may fail to produce a significant average return-beta relationship.

Given the impossibility of testing the CAPM directly, we can retreat to testing the APT, which produces the same expected return-beta equation (the security market line). This model depends only on the index portfolio being well diversified. Choosing a broad market index allows us to test the SML as applied to the chosen index.

# Measurement Error in Beta

To overcome the measurement error problem, Black, Jensen, and Scholes suggested tests using diversified portfolios rather than individual securities. Combining securities into portfolios diversifies away most of the firm-specific part of returns, thereby enhancing the precision of the estimates of beta and the expected rate of return of the portfolio of securities. This mitigates the statistical problems that would otherwise result from imprecision in the beta estimates.

Although the APT strictly applies only to well-diversified portfolios, the discussion in Chapter 9 shows that "almost all" individual securities will also satisfy the SML.
Fischer Black, Michael C. Jensen, and Myron Scholes, "The Capital Asset Pricing Model: Some Empirical Tests," in Studies in the Theory of Capital Markets, ed. Michael C. Jensen (New York: Praeger, 1972).

Testing the model with highly diversified portfolios rather than individual securities completes our retreat from the CAPM to the APT. Additionally, combining stocks into portfolios reduces the number of observations left for the second-pass regression. Suppose we group the 100 stocks into five portfolios of 20 stocks each. The portfolio beta in the first-pass regression will be estimated with far better accuracy. However, with portfolios of 20 stocks each, we are left with only five observations for the second-pass regression.

To get the best of this trade-off, we need to construct portfolios with the largest possible dispersion of beta coefficients. Other things equal, a regression yields more accurate estimates the more widely spaced the observations of the independent variables. We therefore will attempt to maximize the range of the independent variable of the second-pass regression, the portfolio betas. Rather than allocate 20 stocks to each portfolio randomly, we first rank stocks by betas. Portfolio 1 is formed from the 20 highest-beta stocks and portfolio 5 from the 20 lowest-beta stocks. A set of portfolios with small nonsystematic components,  $e_{P}$ , and widely spaced betas will yield reasonably powerful tests of the SML.

Fama and MacBeth (FM) $^6$  used this methodology to verify that the observed relationship between average excess returns and beta is indeed linear and that nonsystematic risk does not explain average excess returns. Using 20 portfolios constructed according to the Black, Jensen, and Scholes methodology, FM expanded the estimation of the SML equation to include the square of the estimated beta coefficient (to test for linearity of the relationship between returns and betas) and the estimated standard deviation of the residual (to test for the explanatory power of nonsystematic risk). For a sequence of many subperiods, they estimated for each subperiod the equation

$$
\overline {{r _ {i} - r _ {f}}} = \gamma_ {0} + \gamma_ {1} b _ {i} + \gamma_ {2} b _ {i} ^ {2} + \gamma_ {3} \sigma \left(e _ {i}\right) \tag {13.4}
$$

The term  $\gamma_{2}$  measures potential nonlinearity of return, and  $\gamma_{3}$  measures the explanatory power of nonsystematic risk,  $\sigma(e_i)$ . According to the CAPM,  $\gamma_{0}, \gamma_{2}$ , and  $\gamma_{3}$  all should have coefficients of zero in the second-pass regression, and  $\gamma_{1}$  should equal the average value of  $r_M - r_f$ .

FM estimated Equation 13.4 for every month of the period January 1935 through June 1968. The results are summarized in Table 13.1, which shows average values of coefficients and  $t$ -statistics. For the most part, their results were broadly supportive of the CAPM. The estimate of the intercept,  $\gamma_0$ , was small (8 basis points per month) and, more important, was not even close to statistical significance. The coefficient on beta,  $\gamma_1$ , was positive and highly significant, indicating that average return rose along with beta. However, the relation was shallower than predicted. Whereas the CAPM predicted that coefficient should

The factors that the CAPM says should not matter for returns,  $\beta^2$  and  $\sigma(e)$ , turn out not to matter, with neither  $\gamma_2$  nor  $\gamma_3$  statistically significant. On balance, therefore, the results seem consistent with the CAPM, or perhaps (in light of the attenuated reward for bearing beta risk) one of the zero-beta extensions of the model reviewed in Chapter 9, Section 9.2.

# Concept Check 13.2 a. What are the implications of the empirical SML being “too flat” compared to the predictions of the CAPM? Specifically, how will average returns on high- versus low-beta stocks compare to the predictions of the SML?

b. What would you have concluded if Fama and MacBeth had found that the coefficients on  $\beta^2$  and  $\sigma(e)$  were positive?

However, recent years have been far less kind to the CAPM. The relation between beta and average returns seems to have evaporated. For example, Fama and French replicated the average return versus beta regression for the period from July 1963 through December 1990 and found that the average slope on  $\beta$  was only 15 basis points per month in a period that the average excess monthly return on the market portfolio was more than double that, 35 basis points. More to the point, the slope on beta was not even close to statistically significant, with a  $t$ -statistic of only .46. Clearly, there is more to the risk-return relationship than the simple CAPM is able to capture.

# 13.2 Tests of the Multifactor Models

Three types of factors are likely candidates to augment the market risk factor in a multifactor SML: (1) factors that hedge consumption against uncertainty in prices of important consumption categories (e.g., housing or energy) or general inflation, (2) factors that hedge future investment opportunities (e.g., interest rates, market volatility, or the market risk premium), and (3) factors that hedge assets missing from the market index (e.g., labor income or private business).

As we learned from Merton's ICAPM (Chapter 9), these extra-market sources of risk will command a risk premium if there is significant demand to hedge them. We begin with the third source because there is little doubt that nontraded assets in the personal portfolios of investors affect demand for traded risky assets. Hence, a factor representing these assets, that is, one correlated with their returns, should affect risk premiums.

# Labor Income

The major factors in the omitted asset category are labor income and private business. Taking on labor income first, Mayers viewed each individual as being endowed with labor

income but able to trade only securities and an index portfolio. His model creates a wedge between betas measured against the traded, index portfolio and betas measured against the true market portfolio, which includes aggregate labor income. The result of his model is an SML that is flatter than that of the simple CAPM.

If the value of labor income is not perfectly correlated with the market-index portfolio, then the possibility of negative returns to labor will represent a source of risk not fully captured by the index. But suppose investors can trade a portfolio that is correlated with the return on aggregate human capital. Then their hedging demands against the risk to the value of their human capital might meaningfully influence security prices and risk premia. If so, human capital risk (or some empirical proxy for it) can serve as an additional factor in a multifactor SML. Stocks with a positive beta on the value of labor contribute to exposure to this risk factor; therefore, they will command lower prices or, equivalently, provide a larger-than-CAPM risk premium. Thus, by adding this factor, the SML becomes multidimensional.

Jagannathan and Wang use the rate of change in aggregate labor income as a proxy for changes in the value of human capital. In addition to standard security betas estimated using the value-weighted stock market index, which we denote  $\beta^{\mathrm{vw}}$ , they also estimate betas of assets with respect to labor income growth, which we denote  $\beta^{\mathrm{labor}}$ . Finally, they consider the possibility that business cycles affect asset betas, an issue that has been examined in a number of other studies. These may be viewed as conditional betas, as their values are conditional on the state of the economy.

Jagannathan and Wang use the credit spread between the yields on low- versus high-grade corporate bonds as a proxy for the state of the business cycle and estimate asset betas relative to this business cycle variable; we denote this beta as  $\beta^{\mathrm{credit}}$ . With the estimates of these three betas for several stock portfolios, they estimate a second-pass regression that also includes firm size (market value of equity, denoted ME):

$$
E \left(R _ {i}\right) = c _ {0} + c _ {\text {s i z e}} \log (\mathrm {M E}) + c _ {\mathrm {v w}} \beta^ {\mathrm {v w}} + c _ {\text {c r e d i t}} \beta^ {\text {c r e d i t}} + c _ {\text {l a b o r}} \beta^ {\text {l a b o r}} \tag {13.5}
$$

They test their model with 100 portfolios that are designed to spread securities on the basis of size and beta. Stocks are sorted into 10 size portfolios, and the stocks within each size decile are further sorted by beta into 10 subportfolios, resulting in 100 portfolios in total. Table 13.2 shows a subset of the various versions of the second-pass estimates. The first two rows in Panel A show the coefficients and  $t$ -statistics of a test of the CAPM along the lines of the Fama and MacBeth tests introduced in the previous section. The result is a sound rejection of the model, as the coefficient on beta is negative (albeit not statistically significant), implying that average return falls with beta. The next two rows show that the CAPM is not helped by the addition of the size factor: The coefficient on beta remains negative. The dramatic increase in  $R$ -square (from  $1.35\%$  to  $57.56\%$ ) shows that size explains variations in average returns quite well while beta does not.

In Panel B, the credit spread and labor income are included as explanatory variables, but the CAPM expected return-beta relationship is not redeemed: The coefficient on beta is still negative. The credit risk premium is significant, while labor income is borderline significant. When we add size as well, in the last two rows, we find it is no longer significant and only marginally increases explanatory power.

The  $\beta_{i}^{\mathrm{vw}}$  is the slope coefficient in the OLS regression of  $R_{it}$  on a constant and  $R_{t}^{\mathrm{vw}}$ . The other betas are estimated in a similar way. The portfolio size,  $\log(\mathrm{ME}_{i})$ , is calculated as the equally weighted average of the logarithm of the market value (in millions of dollars) of the stocks in portfolio  $i$ . The regression models are estimated by using the Fama-MacBeth procedure. All  $R^{2s}$ s are reported as percentages.


# Private (Nontraded) Business

Whereas Jagannathan and Wang focus on labor income, Heaton and Lucas estimate the importance of proprietary business. We expect that private-business owners will reduce demand for traded securities that are positively correlated with their specific entrepreneurial income. If this effect is sufficiently important, aggregate demand for traded securities will be determined in part by the covariance with aggregate noncorporate business income. The risk premium on securities with high covariance with noncorporate business income should be commensurately higher.

Consistent with theory, Heaton and Lucas find that households with higher investments in private business do in fact reduce the fraction of total wealth invested in equity. They also extend Jagannathan and Wang's equation to include the rate of change in proprietary-business wealth. They find that this variable also is significant and improves the explanatory power of the regression. Again, however, exposure to the market rate of return does not help explain the average rate of return on individual securities and, hence, this implication of the CAPM still finds no support.

# Macroeconomic Risk Factors

The multifactor CAPM and APT are elegant theories of how exposure to multiple systematic risk factors should influence expected returns, but they provide little guidance concerning which factors (sources of risk) ought to result in risk premiums.

Chen, Roll, and Ross propose several macroeconomic variables that might proxy for systematic factors:

$\mathrm{IP} =$  Growth rate in industrial production.

EI = Changes in expected inflation measured by changes in short-term (T-bill) interest rates.

$\mathrm{UI} =$  Unexpected inflation, defined as the difference between actual and expected inflation.

$\mathrm{CG} =$  Unexpected changes in risk premiums measured by the difference between the returns on corporate Baa-rated bonds and long-term government bonds.

$\mathrm{GB} =$  Unexpected changes in the term premium measured by the difference between the returns on long- and short-term government bonds.

Given these potential factors, Chen, Roll, and Ross skip the procedure of identifying factor portfolios (the portfolios that have the highest correlation with the factors). Instead, by using the factors themselves, they implicitly assume that factor portfolios exist that can proxy for the factors. They use these factors in a test similar to that of Fama and MacBeth.

As in Fama-MacBeth, they first use five years of monthly data to estimate the factor betas of 20 size-sorted portfolios in 20 first-pass regressions.

$$ r = a + \beta_ {M} r _ {M} + \beta_ {\mathrm {I P}} \mathrm {I P} + \beta_ {\mathrm {E I}} \mathrm {E I} + \beta_ {\mathrm {U I}} \mathrm {U I} + \beta_ {\mathrm {C G}} \mathrm {C G} + \beta_ {\mathrm {G B}} \mathrm {G B} + e \tag {13.6a}
$$ where  $M$  stands for either the equal- or value-weighted NYSE market index.


Using the 20 sets of first-pass estimates of factor betas as the independent variables, they next estimate the second-pass regression (with 20 observations):

$$ r = \gamma_ {0} + \gamma_ {M} \beta_ {M} + \gamma_ {\mathrm {I P}} \beta_ {\mathrm {I P}} + \gamma_ {\mathrm {E I}} \beta_ {\mathrm {E I}} + \gamma_ {\mathrm {U I}} \beta_ {\mathrm {U I}} + \gamma_ {\mathrm {C G}} \beta_ {\mathrm {C G}} + \gamma_ {\mathrm {G B}} \beta_ {\mathrm {G B}} + e \tag {13.6b}
$$ where the gammas become estimates of the risk premiums on the various factors. This second-pass regression is estimated for every month of their sample period. The estimated risk premiums (the estimates of the slope coefficients,  $\gamma$ ) are averaged over all the second-pass regressions and appear in Table 13.3.


The coefficients on the equal- and value-weighted NYSE market indexes EWNY and VWNY are not statistically significant (their  $t$ -statistics are less than 2). But business cycle risk does seem to matter: Industrial production (IP), the risk premium on corporate bonds (CG), and unanticipated inflation (UI) appear to have significant explanatory power.

# 13.3 Fama-French-Type Factor Models

The multifactor models that currently occupy center stage are the three-factor model introduced by Fama and French (FF) and its several variants. The systematic factors in the FF model are firm size and book-to-market ratio (B/M) as well as the market index. These additional factors are empirically motivated by the observations, discussed in Chapter 11, that historical-average returns on stocks of small firms and on stocks with high ratios of book equity to market equity are higher than predicted by the security market line of the CAPM.

However, Fama and French did more than document the empirical role of size and B/M in explaining rates of return. They also introduced a general method to create factor portfolios and applied their method to these constructed factors.

Suppose you find, as Fama and French did, that stock market capitalization (or "market cap") seems to predict alpha values in a CAPM equation. On average, the smaller the market cap, the greater the alpha of a stock. This finding would add size to the list of anomalies that seem to refute the CAPM.

But suppose you believe that size is related to a stock's sensitivity to changes in future investment opportunities. Then, what appears as alpha in a single-factor CAPM is really an extra-market source of risk in a multifactor CAPM. If this sounds far-fetched, here's a story: When investors anticipate a future market downturn, they adjust their portfolios to minimize their exposure to losses. Suppose that small stocks generally are harder hit in down markets, akin to a larger beta in bad times. Then investors will avoid such stocks in favor of the less-sensitive stocks of larger firms. This would explain a risk premium to small size beyond the typical beta on contemporaneous market returns. An "alpha" for size may be instead a risk premium for assets with greater sensitivity to deterioration in future investment opportunities.

Fama and French propose a method to quantify the size risk premium. They first determine the median size of NYSE stocks. They use this median to classify all traded U.S. stocks (NYSE + AMEX + NASDAQ) as big or small and create one portfolio of big stocks and another of small stocks. Each of these portfolios is value-weighted for efficient diversification.

As in the APT, Fama and French construct a zero-net-investment size-factor portfolio by going long the small- and going short the big-stock portfolio. The return of this portfolio, called SMB (Small Minus Big), is simply the return on the small-stock portfolio minus the return on the big-stock portfolio. If size is priced, then this portfolio will exhibit a risk premium. Because the SMB portfolio is highly diversified, it joins the market-index portfolio in a two-factor APT model with size as the extra-market source of risk. In the two-factor SML, the risk premium on any asset should be determined by its loadings (betas) on the two-factor portfolios. This is a testable hypothesis.

Fama and French then generalize this approach to form both size and B/M factors. To create these two extra-market risk factors, they double-sort stocks by both size and B/M. They break the U.S. stock population into three groups based on B/M ratio: the bottom  $30\%$  (low), the middle  $40\%$  (medium), and the top  $30\%$  (high). Now six portfolios are created based on the intersections of the size and B/M sorts: Small/Low, Small/Medium, Small/ High, Big/Low, Big/Medium, Big/High. Each of these six portfolios is value weighted.

The returns on the Big and Small portfolios are

$$
R _ {S} = \mathrm {1 / 3} (R _ {S / L} + R _ {S / M} + R _ {S / H}); R _ {B} = \mathrm {1 / 3} (R _ {B / L} + R _ {B / M} + R _ {B / H})
$$

Similarly, the returns on the high and low (Value and Growth) portfolios are

$$
R _ {H} = 1 / 2 \left(R _ {S / H} + R _ {B / H}\right); R _ {L} = 1 / 2 \left(R _ {S / L} + R _ {B / L}\right)
$$

The returns of the zero-net-investment factors SMB (Small Minus Big, i.e., Long Small and Short Big) and HML (High Minus Low, i.e., Long High B/M and Short Low B/M) are created from these portfolios:

$$
R _ {S M B} = R _ {S} - R _ {B}; R _ {H M L} = R _ {H} - R _ {L}
$$

We measure the sensitivity of individual stocks to the factors by estimating the factor betas from first-pass regressions of stock excess returns on the excess return of the market index as well as on  $R_{SMB}$  and  $R_{HML}$ . These factor betas should, as a group, predict the total risk premium. Therefore, the Fama-French three-factor asset-pricing model is

$$
E \left(r _ {i}\right) - r _ {f} = a _ {i} + b _ {i} \left[ E \left(r _ {M}\right) - r _ {f} \right] + s _ {i} E \left[ R _ {S M B} \right] + h _ {i} E \left[ R _ {H M L} \right] \tag {13.7}
$$

The coefficients  $b_{i}, s_{i}$  and  $h_{i}$  are the betas (also called loadings in this context) of the stock on the three factors. If these are the only risk factors, excess returns on all assets should be fully explained by risk premiums due to these factor loadings. In other words, if these factors fully explain asset returns, the intercept of the equation should be zero.

In a survey of asset pricing tests, Goyal applies Equation 13.7 to the returns of 25 portfolios of all U.S. stocks sorted by size and B/M ratio. Figure 13.1 shows the average actual return of each portfolio over the period 1946-2010 against returns predicted by the CAPM (Panel A) and by the FF three-factor model (Panel B). The FF model provides a clear improvement over the CAPM.

# Size and B/M as Risk Factors

The case for SML and HML as relevant risk factors would be strengthened if they could be related to fundamental sources of asset risk. Liew and Vassalou show that returns on style portfolios (HML or SMB) seem to predict GDP growth, and thus may in fact capture some aspects of business cycle risk. Each bar in Figure 13.2 is the average difference in the return on the HML or SMB portfolio in years before good GDP growth versus in years with poor GDP growth. Positive values mean the portfolio does better in years prior to good macroeconomic performance. The predominance of positive values leads them to conclude that the returns on the HML and SMB portfolios are positively related to future growth in the macroeconomy, and so may be proxies for business cycle risk. Thus, at least part of the size and value premiums may reflect rational rewards for greater risk exposure.


Petkova and Zhang also try to tie the average return premium on value (high B/M) portfolios to risk premiums. Their approach uses a conditional CAPM. In the conventional CAPM, we treat both the market risk premium and firm betas as given parameters. In contrast, as we noted earlier in the chapter, the conditional CAPM allows both of these terms to vary over time, and possibly to co-vary. If a stock's beta is higher when the market risk premium is high, this positive association leads to a "synergy" in its risk premium, which is the product of its incremental beta and market risk premium.

What might lead to such an association between beta and the market risk premium? Zhang focuses on irreversible investments. He notes that firms classified as value firms (with high book-to-market ratios) on average will have greater amounts of tangible capital. Investment irreverses ability puts such firms more at risk for economic downturns because in a severe recession, they will suffer from excess capacity from assets already in place. In contrast, growth firms are better able to deal with a downturn by deferring investment plans. The greater exposure of high book-to-market firms to recessions will result in higher down-market betas. Moreover, some evidence suggests that the market risk premium also is higher in down markets,

The combination of these two factors might impart a positive correlation between the beta of high B/M firms and the market risk premium.

# Behavioral Explanations

On the other side of the debate, several authors make the case that the value premium is a manifestation of market irrationality. The essence of the argument is that analysts tend to extrapolate recent performance too far out into the future, and thus tend to overestimate the value of firms with good recent performance. When the market realizes its mistake, the prices of these firms fall. Thus, on average, "glamour firms," which are characterized by recent good performance, high prices, and lower book-to-market ratios, tend to underperform "value firms" because their high prices reflect excessive optimism relative to those lower book-to-market firms.

Figure 13.3, from a study by Chan, Karceski, and Lakonishok,[20] makes the case for overreaction. Firms are sorted into deciles based on income growth in the past five years. By construction, the growth rates uniformly increase from the first through the tenth decile (see the solid lower line in the figure). The book-to-market ratio for each decile at the end of the five-year period (the dashed line) tracks recent growth very well: B/M falls steadily with growth over the past five years. This is evidence that past growth is extrapolated and then impounded in price. High past growth leads to higher prices and lower B/M ratios.

Figure 13.3 The book-to-market ratio reflects past growth, but not future growth prospects. B/M tends to fall with income growth experienced at the end of a five-year period, but actually increases slightly with future income growth rates.
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/99288b4d3188d5b801b708482771df90465ec044d4dcc65391bd6c6c447ffc84.jpg)
Source: L. K. C. Chan, J. Karceski, and J. Lakonishok, "The Level and Persistence of Growth Rates," Journal of Finance 58 (April 2003), pp. 643-84.

But B/M at the beginning of a five-year period shows little or even a positive association with subsequent growth (the upper solid colored line), implying that market valuation today is inversely related to actual growth prospects. In other words, the firms with lower B/M (glamour firms) experience no better or even worse average future income growth than other firms. The implication is that the market ignores evidence that past growth cannot be extrapolated far into the future. The book-to-market ratio may reflect past growth better than future growth, consistent with extrapolation error.

More direct evidence supporting extrapolation error is provided by La Porta, Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny,[21] who examine stock price performance when actual earnings are released to the public. Firms are classified as growth versus value stocks, and the difference in their stock price performance at earnings announcements for four years following the classification date is then examined. Figure 13.4 demonstrates that growth stocks underperform value stocks surrounding these announcements. We conclude that when news of actual earnings is released to the public, the market is relatively disappointed in stocks it has been treating as growth firms.

# Momentum: A Fourth Factor

Since the seminal Fama-French three-factor model was introduced, a fourth factor has come to be added to the standard controls for stock return behavior. This is a momentum factor. As we first saw in Chapter 11, Jegadeesh and Titman uncovered a tendency for good or

Carhart $^{23}$  added this momentum effect to the three-factor model as a tool to evaluate mutual fund performance. The factor is constructed in the same way and is denoted by WML (Winners Minus Losers). Versions of this factor take winners/losers based on 1–12 months of past returns. Carhart found that much of what appeared to be the alpha of many mutual funds could in fact be explained as due to their loadings or sensitivities to market momentum. The original Fama-French model augmented with a momentum factor has become a common four-factor model used to evaluate abnormal performance of a stock portfolio.
Source: R. La Porta, J. Lakonishok, A. Shleifer, and R. W. Vishny, "Good News for Value Stocks," Journal of Finance 52 (1997), pp. 859-74.


Of course, this additional factor presents further difficulties in interpretation. To characterize the original Fama-French factors as reflecting obvious sources of risk is already a bit of a challenge. A momentum factor seems even harder to position as reflecting a risk-return trade-off.

# The Factor Zoo

Many factors have joined momentum as additions to the Fama-French three-factor model. Table 13.4 presents some of the more prominent ones. The table presents  $t$ -statistics for the impact and statistical significance of each. But this table is just the tip of an ever-growing iceberg. Figure 13.5, from a study by Harvey, Liu, and Zhu shows the growth in the number of factors discovered and published since 1963, the year before the CAPM was published. Until 1991, only about one or two new factors per year appeared in print. But in the last two decades, that number has accelerated dramatically, reaching a cumulative sum exceeding 300 by 2016. Table 13.5, condensed from Harvey, Liu, and Zhu, presents a brief categorization of these factors.

Cochrane points out that order gives way to chaos if we need hundreds of factors to explain or even describe the patterns of expected returns across securities. What is now called the factor zoo calls into question the entire enterprise of trying to understand security returns and risk premia through the lens of a concise factor structure.

What should we make of this empirical sprawl? On the one hand, there may be fewer factors than appear at first blush. Some factors are merely variants on a common theme, for example, related measures of the same underlying characteristic, and so should not be viewed as independent findings. Other factors, even if they are not obviously similar, may be correlated, and thus their predictive power may be evidence of a single underlying priced risk factor. For example, Huo, Xue, and Zhang[26] find that the momentum and HML factors lose much of their statistical significance if one first controls for factors relating to Tobin's  $q$  and profitability (see the discussion of their  $q$ -factor in Chapter 9).

But several other trends raise questions about this entire literature. First, advances in computer power and availability of online databases have made it easier to test for potential factors, with an increase in statistically significant findings an unsurprising outcome. Harvey, Liu, and Zhu argue that at the least, we should respond to this flood of testing by

increasing our standards for statistical significance, for example, increasing the criterion for a significant finding from the traditional  $t$ -statistic of 2 to a higher value of perhaps 3.

But Harvey $^{27}$  notes that increasing the threshold  $t$ -statistic is almost certainly not an adequate solution due to several related but slightly different methodological problems. First is the problem of  $p$ -hacking. This refers to running different tests and reporting only the statistically significant results (i.e., those with an adequate significance level or  $p$ -value). A related problem is multiple testing. This arises when someone tests several factors simultaneously. While the probability of a "false positive" for any single test may be a common value such as  $5\%$ , when we perform multiple tests (again, reporting only the most significant findings), the chance of a false positive is far higher. Data snooping further exacerbates the problem. Here, someone might "test" a factor having already seen evidence of a relationship in the data. It should be clear that specifying a hypothesis only after looking at relationships in the data invalidates a test and borders on research malpractice. A related and equally problematic practice is measuring many empirical relationships, finding one that seems significant, and only then proposing a theory that "predicts" such a relationship that can be "confirmed" by the data.

Harvey, Liu, and Zhu argue that in the absence of these problems, we should have observed a decline in new factor discovery over time as the obvious candidates for risk factors were initially tested, leaving ever-fewer plausible factors remaining to be tested. The fact that we actually find the opposite pattern suggests that the literature is awash in false findings. And several papers, for example, McLean and Pontiff[28] (discussed in more detail in Chapter 9), that document out-of-sample declines in returns to a wide variety of portfolio strategies constitute further evidence of data mining problems.

Is there a way out of the factor zoo? We clearly need to adjust our criteria for statistical significance. Harvey addresses this question in his presidential address to the American Finance Association (see footnote 27) and suggests several modifications to what constitutes a "statistically significant" finding. Feng, Giglio, and Xiu propose a model selection method to evaluate the incremental contribution of a newly proposed factor beyond the explanatory power of an already-known set of factors. They conclude that their approach would have deemed only a small number of recently proposed factors as statistically significant, thus radically reducing the population of the factor zoo. One notable factor that passes their far-more-stringent test relates to measures of firm profitability.

# 13.4 Liquidity and Asset Pricing

In Chapter 9 we saw that an important extension of the CAPM incorporates considerations of asset liquidity. Liquidity embodies several characteristics such as trading costs, ease of sale, necessary price concessions to effect a quick transaction, market depth, and price predictability. As such, it is difficult to measure with any single statistic. Popular measures of liquidity, or, more precisely, illiquidity, focus on the price impact dimension: What price concession might a seller have to offer in order to quickly accomplish a large sale of an asset or, conversely, what premium must a buyer offer to make a large purchase?

One measure of illiquidity is employed by Pástor and Stambaugh,[30] who look for evidence of price reversals, especially following large trades. Their idea is that if stock price movements tend to be partially reversed on the following day, then we can conclude that part of the original price change was not due to perceived changes in intrinsic value (these price changes would not tend to be reversed) but was, instead, a symptom of price impact associated with the original trade. Reversals suggest that part of the original price change was a concession on the part of trade initiators who needed to offer higher purchase prices or accept lower selling prices to complete their trades in a timely manner. Pástor and Stambaugh use regression analysis to show that reversals do in fact tend to be larger when associated with higher trading volume—exactly the pattern that one would expect if part of the price move is a liquidity phenomenon. They run a regression of returns on lagged returns and trading volume. The coefficient on the latter term measures the tendency of high-volume trades to be accompanied by larger reversals.

Another measure of illiquidity, proposed by Amihud,[31] also focuses on the association between large trades and price movements. His measure is

$$
\text {I L L I Q} = \text {M o n t h l y a v e r a g e o f d a i l y} \left[ \frac {\text {A b s o l u t e v a l u e (S t o c k r e t u r n)}}{\text {D o l l a r v o l u m e}} \right]
$$

This measure of illiquidity is based on the price impact per dollar of transactions in the stock and can be used to estimate both liquidity cost and liquidity risk.

Finally, Sadka uses trade-by-trade data to devise a third measure of liquidity. He begins with the observation that part of price impact, a major component of illiquidity cost, is due to asymmetric information. (See our discussion of liquidity in Chapter 9 for a review of asymmetric information and the bid-ask spread.) He then uses regression analysis to break out the component of price impact that is due to information issues. The liquidity of firms can wax or wane as the prevalence of informationally motivated trades varies, giving rise to liquidity risk.

Any of these liquidity measures can be averaged over stocks to devise measures of marketwide illiquidity. Given market illiquidity, we can then measure the "liquidity beta" of any individual stock (the sensitivity of returns to changes in market liquidity) and estimate the impact of liquidity risk on expected return. If stocks with high liquidity betas have higher average returns, we conclude that liquidity is a "priced factor," meaning that exposure to it offers higher expected return as compensation for the risk.

Pastor and Stambaugh conclude that liquidity risk is in fact a priced factor and that the risk premium associated with it is quantitatively significant. They sort portfolios into deciles based on liquidity beta and then compute the average alphas of the stocks in each decile using two models that ignore liquidity: the CAPM and the Fama-French three-factor model. Figure 13.6 shows that the alpha computed under either model rises substantially across liquidity-beta deciles, clear evidence that when controlling for other factors, average return rises along with liquidity risk. Not surprisingly, the relationship between liquidity risk and alpha across deciles is more regular for the Fama-French model, as it controls for a wider range of other influences on average return.

Pastor and Stambaugh also test the impact of the liquidity beta on alpha computed from a four-factor model (that also controls for momentum) and obtain similar results. In fact, they suggest that the liquidity risk factor may account for a good part of the apparent profitability of the momentum strategy.

Acharya and Pedersen use Amihud's measure to test for price effects associated with the average level of illiquidity as well as a liquidity risk premium. They demonstrate that expected stock returns depend on the average level of illiquidity. (Figure 9.4 in Chapter 9 shows a similar result.) But Acharya and Pedersen demonstrate that stock returns depend on several liquidity betas as well: the sensitivity of individual stock illiquidity to market illiquidity, the sensitivity of stock returns to market illiquidity, and the sensitivity of stock illiquidity to market return. They conclude that adding these liquidity effects to the conventional CAPM increases our ability to explain expected asset returns.

# 13.5 The Equity Premium Puzzle

In Chapter 9, we briefly introduced Merton's multifactor or intertemporal CAPM (commonly called the ICAPM) and its close cousin, the consumption CAPM (the CCAPM). Both of these models envision investors attempting to devise an investment plan that will maximize the utility they derive from a lifetime flow of consumption. In each period, the investor must choose how much to consume versus how much to invest to provide for future consumption, as well as how to allocate the investment portfolio.


The consumption model implies that what matters to investors is not their wealth per se, but their lifetime flow of consumption. There can be slippage between wealth and consumption due to variation in factors such as the risk-free rate, the market risk premium, or prices of major consumption items. Therefore, a better measure of consumer well-being than wealth is the consumption flow that such wealth can support.

Given this framework, the generalization of the standard CAPM is that instead of measuring systematic risk based on the covariance of returns with the market return (a measure that focuses only on wealth), we are better off using the covariance of returns with "aggregate" or economywide consumption. Hence, we would expect the risk premium of the market index to be related to that covariance as follows:

$$
E \left(r _ {M}\right) - r _ {f} = A \operatorname {C o v} \left(r _ {M}, r _ {C}\right) \tag {13.8}
$$ where  $A$  reflects average risk aversion and  $r_C$  is the rate of return on a "consumption-tracking portfolio," constructed to have the highest possible correlation with growth in aggregate consumption.


The problem is that consumption growth is not very variable. With such low volatility in consumption, the covariance term on the right-hand side of Equation 13.8 is also low. In turn, with such low "systematic" consumption risk, it is hard to justify a market risk premium as large as the one we have observed historically unless we assume implausibly high levels of risk aversion. This empirical problem is called the equity premium puzzle.[34]

Nevertheless, Jagannathan and Wang find some success with a consumption-tracking portfolio. Table 13.6, excerpted from their study, shows that the Fama-French factors are

in fact associated with consumption betas as well as excess returns. The top panel contains familiar results: Moving across each row, we see that higher book-to-market ratios are associated with higher average returns. Similarly, moving down each column, we see that larger size generally implies lower average returns. The novel results are in the lower panel: A high book-to-market ratio is associated with higher consumption beta, and larger firm size is generally associated with lower consumption beta. The suggestion is that the explanatory power of the Fama-French factors for average returns may in fact reflect differences in consumption risk of those portfolios. Figure 13.7 shows that the average returns of the 25 Fama-French portfolios are strongly associated with their consumption betas.

Moreover, the standard CCAPM focuses on a representative consumer/investor, thereby ignoring information about heterogeneous investors with different levels of wealth and consumption habits. For exam-

Annual excess returns and consumption betas. This figure plots the average annual excess returns on the 25 Fama-French portfolios and their consumption betas. Each two-digit number represents one portfolio. The first digit refers to the size quintile (1 = smallest, 5 = largest), and the second digit refers to the book-to-market quintile (1 = lowest, 5 = highest).

ple, the covariance between market returns and consumption is far higher when we focus on the consumption risk of households that actually hold financial securities. This observation mitigates the equity risk premium puzzle.

# Expected versus Realized Returns

Fama and French offer another interpretation of the equity premium puzzle. Using stock index returns from 1872 to 1999, they report the average risk-free rate, average stock market return (represented by the S&P 500 index), and resultant risk premium for the overall period and subperiods:

<table><tr><td>Period</td><td>Risk-Free Rate</td><td>S&amp;P 500 Return</td><td>Equity Premium</td></tr><tr><td>1872–1999</td><td>4.87</td><td>10.97</td><td>6.10</td></tr><tr><td>1872–1949</td><td>4.05</td><td>8.67</td><td>4.62</td></tr><tr><td>1950–1999</td><td>6.15</td><td>14.56</td><td>8.41</td></tr></table>

The big increase in the average excess return on equity after 1949 suggests that the equity premium puzzle is largely a creature of modern times.

Fama and French suspect that estimating the risk premium from average realized returns may be the problem. They use the constant-growth dividend-discount model (for a review, see an introductory finance text or Chapter 18) to estimate expected returns and find that for the period 1872-1949, the dividend discount model (DDM) yields similar estimates of the expected risk premium as the average realized excess return. But for the period 1950-1999, the DDM yields a much smaller risk premium, which suggests that the high average excess return in this period may have exceeded the returns investors actually expected to earn at the time.

In the constant-growth DDM, the expected capital gains rate equals the growth rate of dividends. As a result, the expected total stock return is the sum of dividend yield (dividend/price) plus the expected dividend growth rate,  $g$ :

$$
E (r) = \frac {D _ {1}}{P _ {0}} + g \tag {13.9}
$$ where  $D_{1}$  is end-of-year dividends and  $P_{0}$  is the current price of the stock. Fama and French use Equation 13.9 to produce estimates of  $E(r)$  for the S&P 500.


For each year, they estimate expected return from the sum of the dividend yield  $(D_{t} / P_{t - 1})$  plus the dividend growth rate  $(g_{t} = D_{t} / D_{t - 1} - 1)$ . In contrast, the realized return is the dividend yield plus capital gains  $(P_{t} / P_{t - 1} - 1)$ . The following table shows that while the DDM and actual returns were similar in the earlier period, realized returns in the latter period were far higher. Moreover, the statistical precision of DDM returns was far greater than those of average realized returns, as reflected in a far smaller standard error. Fama and French conclude that the equity premium puzzle may be due at least in part to unanticipated capital gains in the latter period.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Period</td><td colspan="2">Mean Return</td><td colspan="2">Standard Error</td><td colspan="2">t-Statistic</td><td colspan="2">Sharpe Ratio</td></tr><tr><td>DDM</td><td>Realized</td><td>DDM</td><td>Realized</td><td>DDM</td><td>Realized</td><td>DDM</td><td>Realized</td></tr><tr><td>1872–1999</td><td>4.03</td><td>6.10</td><td>1.14</td><td>1.65</td><td>3.52</td><td>3.70</td><td>0.22</td><td>0.34</td></tr><tr><td>1872–1949</td><td>4.35</td><td>4.62</td><td>1.76</td><td>2.20</td><td>2.47</td><td>2.10</td><td>0.23</td><td>0.24</td></tr><tr><td>1950–1999</td><td>3.54</td><td>8.41</td><td>1.03</td><td>2.45</td><td>3.42</td><td>3.43</td><td>0.21</td><td>0.51</td></tr></table>

Fama and French's study provides a simple explanation for the equity premium puzzle, namely, that observed rates of return in the recent half-century were unexpectedly high. It also implies that forecasts of future excess returns will be lower than past averages. The fact that the U.S. has been an outlier relative to other countries, providing one of the highest Sharpe ratios (see Figure 5.10), corroborates the view that its historical experience may have been better than market participants originally anticipated.

# Survivorship Bias

The equity premium puzzle emerged from long-term averages of U.S. stock returns. There are reasons to suspect that these estimates of the risk premium are subject to survivorship bias, as the United States had one of the most successful economies in the world, an outcome that would not have seemed inevitable much before the second World War. Jurion and Goetzmann[38] assembled a database of capital appreciation indexes for the stock markets of 39 countries over the period 1921-1996. Figure 13.8 shows that U.S. equities had the highest real return of all countries, at  $4.3\%$  annually, versus a median of  $0.8\%$  for other countries. Moreover, unlike the United States, many other countries have had equity markets that actually closed, either permanently or for extended periods of time, following economic disruptions caused by war or revolution.


The implication of these results is that using average U.S. data may impart a form of survivorship bias to our estimate of expected returns because, unlike many other countries, the United States has never been a victim of such extreme problems. Estimating risk premiums from the experience of the country with the highest average return and ignoring the evidence from stock markets that did not survive for the full sample period will impart an upward bias in estimates of expected returns. The high realized equity premium obtained for the United States may not be indicative of required returns.

# Extensions to the CAPM May Mitigate the Equity Premium Puzzle

Constantinides argues that the standard CAPM can be extended to account for observed excess returns by relaxing some of its assumptions, in particular, by recognizing that consumers face uninsurable and idiosyncratic income shocks, for example, the loss of employment. The prospect of such events is higher in economic downturns, and bad outcomes such as job loss are not shared evenly across all members of the economy. This observation can take us a long way toward understanding the risk-return trade-off as well as its variation across the business cycle.

In addition, life-cycle considerations are important and often overlooked. Borrowing constraints become important when placed in the context of the life cycle. The imaginary "representative consumer" who holds all stock and bond market wealth does not face borrowing constraints. Young consumers, however, do face meaningful borrowing constraints.

Constantinides traces their impact on the equity premium, the demand for bonds, and the limited participation of many consumers in the capital markets. He also shows that adding habit formation to the conventional utility function helps justify higher risk premiums than those that would be predicted by the covariance of stock returns with aggregate consumption growth. Habit formation refers to the observation that investors may become acclimated to a given level of consumption that they have experienced or observed over extended periods of time. It becomes hard to cut back from a consumption level you have come to view as "normal," even if it might appear luxuriant to someone else. Habit formation can make investors act as if they are more risk averse, as they can become highly sensitive to losses even if it appears that they have a comfortable cushion to absorb poor returns.[40]

Another attempt to resolve the equity premium puzzle appeals to the idea of "long-run risk." Suppose that an increase in consumption growth this year signals to the market that growth likely will be higher for several years to come. In that event, while the covariance between asset returns and contemporaneous consumption growth may be low, the covariance of returns with the present value of the entire consumption stream will be much larger. This long-run forward-looking view generates much higher values for systematic (consumption-based) risk and makes the historical equity premium easier to justify.

Finally, some authors explain the risk premium puzzle by appealing to rare disaster risk.42 Suppose there is a very low probability of a truly calamitous economic crash, on the order of another Great Depression. We may go an entire lifetime without experiencing such a crash, so episodes representing such an extreme outcome may never enter our datasets. But investors may nevertheless be concerned about the potential for such a disaster, in which case risk premia will reflect their concern. If so, asset risk premia may reflect compensation for potential disasters that actually have not (yet!) shown up in the historical record. This can make it appear as if risk premia are excessive compared to the risk that has materialized.

# Liquidity and the Equity Premium Puzzle

We've seen that liquidity risk is potentially important in explaining the cross section of stock returns. The illiquidity premium may be on the same order of magnitude as the market risk premium. Therefore, the common practice of treating the average excess return on a market index as an estimate of a risk premium per se is too simplistic. Part of that average excess return is almost certainly compensation for liquidity risk rather than just the (systematic) volatility of returns. If this is recognized, the equity premium puzzle may be less of a puzzle than it first appears.

# Behavioral Explanations of the Equity Premium Puzzle

Barberis and Huang explain the puzzle as an outcome of irrational investor behavior. The key elements of their approach are loss aversion and narrow framing, two well-known features of decision making under risk in experimental settings. Narrow framing is the idea that investors evaluate every risk they face in isolation. Thus, investors will focus on total volatility rather than the low correlation of a stock portfolio with other components of wealth, and therefore they will require a higher risk premium than rational models would predict. Combined with loss aversion, investor behavior will generate large risk premiums despite the fact that traditionally measured risk aversion is low. (See Chapter 12 for more discussion of loss aversion and other behavioral biases.)

Models that incorporate these effects can generate a large equilibrium equity risk premium and a low and stable risk-free rate, even when consumption growth is smooth and only weakly correlated with the stock market. Moreover, they can do so for parameter values that correspond to plausible predictions about attitudes to independent monetary gambles.

The behavioral analysis of the equity premium also has implications for a closely related puzzle, the stock market participation puzzle. Narrow framing can explain why a segment of the population that one would expect to participate in the stock market still avoids it. The assessment of stock market volatility in isolation ignores its limited impact on consumption. Loss aversion that exaggerates disutility of losses relative to a reference point magnifies this effect.

# SUMMARY

1. Early tests of the single-factor CAPM were generally supportive of the model, but that support has long since evaporated. The positive relation between beta and average return has not characterized the data for decades.
2. Roll's critique implies that the usual CAPM test is a test only of the mean-variance efficiency of a prespecified market proxy and therefore that tests of the linearity of the expected return-beta relationship do not bear on the validity of the model.
3. Tests of the index model that account for human capital and cyclical variations in asset betas are more supportive of the CAPM and APT. Moreover, anomalies such as the size and book-to-market effects are somewhat mitigated once these variables are accounted for.
4. The dominant multifactor models today are variants of the Fama-French model, incorporating market, size, value, momentum, and, sometimes, liquidity or other factors. However, the recent emergence of an ever-growing collection of discovered factors casts doubt on the validity of many of these findings. This has led to several suggestions that the criteria for widespread acceptance of a priced factor be tightened.
5. In some tests of consumption-based capital asset pricing models, consumption betas help to explain average portfolio returns and are associated with the Fama-French factors. These results support Fama and French's conjecture that their factors proxy for more fundamental sources of risk.
6. The equity premium puzzle originates from the observation that equity returns exceeded the risk-free rate to an extent that is inconsistent with the covariance of returns with consumption risk and reasonable levels of risk aversion—at least when average rates of return are taken to represent expectations. Some explanations for this puzzle focus on incomplete risk sharing or on habit formation. Other explanations are empirically based. For example, the puzzle emerges primarily from excess returns in the post-World War II period. It is plausible that the extent of the economic success of the United States in the post-war period was unexpected, making historical averages unrepresentative of prior expected values. Alternative estimates of expected returns using the dividend growth model instead of average returns suggest that excess returns on stocks were high largely because of unexpectedly large capital gains.

12. Suppose you own your own business, which now makes up about half your net worth. On the basis of what you have learned in this chapter, how would you structure your portfolio of financial assets?

1. Identify and briefly discuss three criticisms of beta as used in the capital asset pricing model.
2. Richard Roll, in an article on using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to evaluate portfolio performance, indicated that it may not be possible to evaluate portfolio management ability if there is an error in the benchmark used.

a. In evaluating portfolio performance, describe the generally employed procedure, with emphasis on the benchmark portfolio.
b. Explain what Roll meant by benchmark error and identify the specific problem with this benchmark.
c. Draw a graph that shows how a portfolio that has been judged as superior relative to a "measured" security market line (SML) can be inferior relative to the "true" SML.
d. Assume that you are informed that a given portfolio manager has been evaluated as superior when compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the NYSE Composite Index. Explain whether this consensus would make you feel more comfortable regarding the portfolio manager's true ability.
e. Although conceding the possible problem with benchmark errors as set forth by Roll, some contend this does not mean the CAPM is incorrect, but only that there is a measurement problem when implementing the theory. Others contend that because of benchmark errors, the whole technique should be scrapped. Take and defend one of these positions.

3. Bart Campbell, CFA, is a portfolio manager who has recently met with a prospective client, Jane Black. After conducting a survey market line (SML) performance analysis using the Dow Jones Industrial Average as her market proxy, Black claims that her portfolio has experienced superior performance. Campbell uses the capital asset pricing model as an investment performance measure and finds that Black's portfolio plots below the SML. Campbell concludes that Black's apparent superior performance is a function of an incorrectly specified market proxy, not superior investment management. Justify Campbell's conclusion by addressing the likely effects of an incorrectly specified market proxy on both beta and the slope of the SML.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. The SCL is estimated for each stock; hence, we need to estimate 100 equations. Our sample consists of 60 monthly rates of return for each of the 100 stocks and for the market index. Thus each regression is estimated with 60 observations. Equation 13.1 in the text shows that when stated in excess return form, the SCL should pass through the origin, that is, have a zero intercept.
2. a. When the SML has a positive intercept and its slope is less than the mean excess return on the market portfolio, it is flatter than predicted by the CAPM. Low-beta stocks therefore have provided returns that, on average, were higher than they should have been on the basis of their beta. Conversely, high-beta stocks were found to have provided, on average, lower returns than they should have on the basis of their betas.
b. A positive coefficient on  $\beta^2$  would indicate that the relationship between risk and return is nonlinear. High-beta securities would provide expected returns more than proportional to risk. A positive coefficient on  $\sigma (e)$  would indicate that firm-specific risk affects expected return, a direct contradiction of the CAPM and APT.

IN THE PREVIOUS chapters on risk and return relationships, we treated securities at a high level of abstraction. We assumed implicitly that a prior, detailed analysis of each security already had been performed and that its risk and return features had been assessed.

We now turn to specific analyses of particular security markets. We examine valuation principles, determinants of risk and return, and portfolio strategies commonly used within and across the various markets.

We begin by analyzing debt securities, which are claims on a specified periodic stream of cash flows. Debt securities are often called fixed-income securities because they promise either a fixed stream of income or one that is determined according to a specified formula. They have the advantage of being relatively easy to understand because the payment formulas are laid out in advance. Uncertainty about cash flows is minimal as long as the issuer of the security is sufficiently creditworthy. That makes them a convenient starting point for our analysis of the universe of potential investment vehicles.


The bond is the basic debt security, and this chapter starts with an overview of the universe of bond markets, including Treasury, corporate, and international bonds. We turn next to pricing, showing how bond prices are set in accordance with market interest rates and why they change with those rates. Given this background, we can compare myriad measures of bond returns such as yield to maturity, yield to call, holding-period return, and realized compound rate of return. We show how bond prices evolve over time, discuss tax rules that apply to debt securities, and show how to calculate after-tax returns.

Finally, we consider the impact of default or credit risk on bond pricing and look at the determinants of credit risk and the default premium built into bond yields. Credit risk is central to fixed-income derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps, so we examine these instruments as well.

# 14.1 Bond Characteristics

A bond is a security that is issued in connection with a borrowing arrangement. The borrower issues (i.e., sells) a bond to the lender for some amount of cash; the bond is the "IOU" of the borrower. The issuer agrees to make specified payments to the bondholder on specified dates. In a typical coupon bond, the issuer makes semiannual payments of interest for the life of the bond. These are called coupon payments because in precomputer days, most bonds had coupons that investors would clip off and present to claim the interest payment. When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the bond's par value (equivalently, its face value). The coupon rate of the bond determines the interest payment: The annual payment is the coupon rate times the bond's par value. The coupon rate, maturity date, and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture, which is the contract between the issuer and the bondholder.

To illustrate, a bond with par value of 1,000 and coupon rate of 8\% might be sold for 1,000. The bondholder is entitled to a payment of 8\% of par value, or 80 per year, for the life of the bond, say, 30 years. The \$80 payment typically comes in two semiannual installments of \$40 each. At the end of the bond's 30-year life, the issuer also pays the 1,000 par value to the bondholder.

Bonds usually are issued with coupon rates set just high enough to induce investors to pay par value for them. Sometimes, however, zero-coupon bonds are issued that make no coupon payments. In this case, investors receive par value at the maturity date but receive no interest payments until then: The bond has a coupon rate of zero. These bonds are issued at prices considerably below par value, and the investor's return comes solely from the difference between the issue price and the payment of par value at maturity. We will return to these bonds later.

# Treasury Bonds and Notes

Figure 14.1 is an excerpt from the listing of Treasury issues. Treasury notes are issued with original maturities ranging between 1 and 10 years, while Treasury bonds are issued with maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years. Both bonds and notes may be purchased directly from the Treasury in denominations of only \$100, but denominations of \$1,000 are far more common. Both make semiannual coupon payments.

The highlighted bond in Figure 14.1 matures on August 15, 2049. Its coupon rate is  $2.25\%$ . Par value typically is  $\$1,000$ ; thus, the bond pays interest of  $\$22.50$  per year in two semiannual payments of  $\$11.25$ . Payments are made in February and August of each year. Although bonds usually are sold in denominations of  $\$1,000$ , the bid and ask prices are quoted as a percentage of par value. $^{1}$  Therefore, the ask price is  $106.725\%$  of par or  $\$1,067.25$ .

The last column, labeled "Asked Yield," is the yield to maturity on the bond based on the ask price. The yield to maturity is a measure of the average rate of return to an investor who purchases the bond for the ask price and holds it until its maturity date. We will have much to say about yield to maturity below.

Accrued Interest and Quoted Bond Prices The prices you see quoted online or in the financial pages are not the prices that investors actually pay for the bond. This is because the quoted price does not include the interest that accrues between coupon payment dates.

If a bond is purchased between coupon payments, the buyer must pay the seller for accrued interest, the prorated share of the upcoming semiannual coupon. For example, if 30 days have passed since the last coupon payment, and there are 182 days in the semiannual coupon period, the seller is entitled to accrued interest of 30/182 of the semiannual coupon. The sale, or invoice, price of the bond would equal the stated price (sometimes called the flat price) plus the accrued interest.

In general, the formula for the accrued interest between two dates is

$$
\text {A c c r u e d i n t e r e s t} = \frac {\text {A n n u a l c o u p o n p a y m e n t}}{2} \times \frac {\text {D a y s s i n c e l a s t c o u p o n p a y m e n t}}{\text {D a y s s e p a r a t i n g c o u p o n p a y m e n t}}
$$

# Example 14.1 Accrued Interest

Suppose that the coupon rate is 8\%. Then the annual coupon is \$80 and the semiannual coupon payment is \$40. Because 30 days have passed since the last coupon payment, the accrued interest on the bond is $40 × (30/182) = $6.59. If the quoted price of the bond is \$990, then the invoice price will be $990 + $6.59 = \$996.59.

The practice of quoting bond prices net of accrued interest explains why the price of a maturing bond is listed at  \$1,000 rather than\$ 1,000 plus one coupon payment. A purchaser of an 8\% coupon bond one day before the bond's maturity would receive \$1,040 (par value plus semiannual interest) on the following day and so should be willing to pay $1,040. But $40 of that payment constitutes the accrued interest for the preceding half-year period. The bond price is quoted net of accrued interest in the financial pages and thus appears as \$1,000.[2]

# Corporate Bonds

Like the government, corporations borrow money by issuing bonds. Figure 14.2 is a sample of listings for a few actively traded corporate bonds. Although some bonds trade electronically on the NYSE Bonds platform, and some electronic trading platforms now allow participants to trade bonds directly, most bonds still trade on a traditional over-the-counter market in a network of bond dealers linked by a computer quotation system. In part, this is

While most public firms have issued only one class of common stock, they may have dozens of bonds differing by maturity, coupon rate, seniority, and so on. Therefore, the bond market can be quite "thin," with few investors interested in trading a particular issue at any particular time.


The bond listings in Figure 14.2 include the coupon, maturity, price, and yield to maturity of each bond. The "rating" column is the estimation of bond safety given by the bond-rating agencies Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Bonds with gradations of A ratings are safer than those with B ratings or below. As a general rule, safer bonds with higher ratings promise lower yields to maturity than other bonds with similar maturities. We will return to this topic toward the end of the chapter.

Call Provisions on Corporate Bonds Some corporate bonds are issued with call provisions allowing the issuer to repurchase the bond at a specified call price before the maturity date. For example, if a company issues a bond with a high coupon rate when market interest rates are high and interest rates later fall, the firm might like to retire the high-coupon debt and issue new bonds at a lower coupon rate to reduce interest payments. This is called refunding. Callable bonds typically come with a period of call protection, an initial time during which the bonds are not callable. These are referred to as deferred callable bonds.

The option to call the bond is valuable to the firm, allowing it to buy back the bonds and refinance at lower interest rates when market rates fall. Of course, the firm's benefit is the bondholder's burden. When bonds are called, investors must forfeit them for the call price, thereby giving up the attractive coupon rate on their original investment. As compensation for this risk, callable bonds are issued with higher coupons and promised yields to maturity than noncallable bonds.

# Concept Check 14.1

Suppose that Verizon issues two bonds with identical coupon rates and maturity dates. One bond is callable, however, whereas the other is not. Which bond will sell at a lower price?

Convertible Bonds Convertible bonds give bondholders an option to exchange each bond for a specified number of shares of common stock of the firm. The conversion ratio is the number of shares for which each bond may be exchanged. Suppose a convertible bond is issued at par value of  \$1,000 and is convertible into 40 shares of a firm's stock. The current stock price is\$ 20 per share, so the option to convert is not profitable now. Should the stock price later rise to \$30, however, each bond may be converted profitably into \$1,200 worth of stock. The market conversion value is the current value of the shares for which the bonds may be exchanged. At the \$20 stock price, for example, the bond's conversion value is \$800. The conversion premium is the excess of the bond's value over its conversion value. If the bond were selling currently for \$950, its premium would be \$150.

Convertible bondholders benefit from price appreciation of the company's stock. Not surprisingly, this benefit comes at a price: Convertible bonds offer lower coupon rates and yields to maturity than nonconvertible bonds. However, the actual return on the convertible bond may exceed the stated yield to maturity if the option to convert becomes profitable.

We discuss convertible and callable bonds further in Chapter 20.

Puttable Bonds While a callable bond gives the issuer the option to extend or retire the bond at the call date, an extendable or put bond gives this option to the bondholder. If the bond's coupon rate exceeds current market yields, for instance, the bondholder will choose to extend the bond's life. If the bond's coupon rate is too low, it will be optimal not to extend; in this case, the bondholder will instead reclaim principal, which can be invested at current yields.

Floating-Rate Bonds Floating-rate bonds make interest payments tied to some measure of current market rates. For example, the rate might be adjusted annually to the current T-bill rate plus  $2\%$ . If the 1-year T-bill rate at the adjustment date is  $4\%$ , the bond's coupon rate over the next year would then be  $6\%$ . Therefore, the bond always pays approximately current market rates.

The major risk in floaters has to do with changes in the firm's financial strength. The yield spread is fixed over the life of the security, which may be many years. If the financial health of the firm deteriorates, then investors will demand a greater yield premium than is offered by the security, and the price of the bond will fall. Although the coupon rate on floaters adjusts to changes in the general level of market interest rates, it does not adjust to changes in financial condition.

# Preferred Stock

Although preferred stock, strictly speaking, is considered to be equity, it often is included in the fixed-income universe. This is because, like bonds, preferred stock promises to pay a specified cash flow stream. However, unlike bonds, the failure to pay the promised dividend does not result in corporate bankruptcy. Instead, the dividends owed simply cumulate, and the common stockholders may not receive any dividends until the preferred stockholders have been paid in full. In the event of bankruptcy, preferred stockholders' claims to the firm's assets have lower priority than those of bondholders but higher priority than those of common stockholders.

Preferred stock commonly pays a fixed dividend. Therefore, it is in effect a perpetuity, providing a level cash flow indefinitely. In contrast, floating-rate preferred stock is much like floating-rate bonds. The dividend rate is linked to a measure of current market interest rates and is adjusted at regular intervals.

Unlike interest payments on bonds, dividends on preferred stock are not considered tax-deductible expenses. This reduces their attractiveness as a source of capital for issuing firms. On the other hand, preferred stock offers an offsetting tax advantage. When one corporation buys the preferred stock of another, it pays taxes on only  $50\%$  of the dividends received. For example, if the firm's tax bracket is  $21\%$ , and it receives  $\$10,000$  in preferred-dividend payments, it pays taxes on only half of that income: Total taxes are  $21 \times$ 5,000 = \$1,050. The firm's effective tax rate on preferred dividends is therefore only  $21 \times 50\% = 10.5\%$ . Given this tax rule, it is not surprising that most preferred stock is held by corporations.

Preferred stock rarely gives its holders full voting privileges in the firm. However, if the preferred dividend is skipped, the preferred stockholders may then be provided some voting power.

# Other Domestic Issuers

There are, of course, several issuers of bonds in addition to the Treasury and private corporations. For example, state and local governments issue municipal bonds. Their outstanding feature is that interest payments are tax-free. We examined municipal bonds, the value of the tax exemption, and the equivalent taxable yield of these bonds in Chapter 2.

Government agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Farm Credit agencies, and the mortgage pass-through agencies Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac also issue considerable amounts of bonds. These too were reviewed in Chapter 2.

# International Bonds

International bonds are commonly divided into two categories, foreign bonds and Eurobonds. Foreign bonds are issued by a borrower from a country other than the one in which the bond is sold. The bond is denominated in the currency of the country in which it is marketed. For example, a dollar-denominated bond issued in the United States by a German firm is considered a foreign bond. These bonds are given colorful names based on the countries in which they are marketed. Foreign bonds sold in the United States are called Yankee bonds. Yen-denominated bonds sold in Japan by non-Japanese issuers are called *Samurai* bonds. British pound-denominated foreign bonds sold in the United Kingdom are called *bulldog* bonds.

In contrast to foreign bonds, Eurobonds are denominated in one currency, usually that of the issuer, but sold in other national markets. For example, the Eurodollar market refers to dollar-denominated bonds sold outside the United States (not just in Europe). Because the Eurodollar market falls outside U.S. jurisdiction, these bonds are not regulated by U.S. federal agencies. Similarly, Euroyen bonds are yen-denominated bonds selling outside Japan, Eurosterling bonds are pound-denominated bonds selling outside the United Kingdom, and so on.

# Innovation in the Bond Market

Issuers constantly develop innovative bonds with unusual features; these issues illustrate that bond design can be extremely flexible. The novel bonds discussed next will give you a sense of the potential variety in security design.

Maturity Bonds conventionally are issued with maturities up to 30 years, but there is nothing sacrosanct about that limit. In recent years, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Austria have issued bonds with maturities ranging from 50 to 100 years. In the 18th century, the British government issued bonds called consols with infinite maturity (thus making these bonds perpetuities). These, however, have been redeemed and thus no longer trade.

Inverse Floaters These are similar to the floating-rate bonds we described earlier, except that the coupon rate on these bonds falls when the general level of interest rates rises. Investors in these bonds suffer doubly when rates rise. Not only does the present value of each dollar of cash flow from the bond fall, but the level of those cash flows falls as well. Of course, investors in these bonds benefit doubly when rates fall.


Asset-Backed Bonds Miramax has issued bonds with coupon rates tied to the financial performance of its films. Tesla has issued bonds with payments backed by revenue generated by leases of its Model S and Model X cars. Some shale companies have created bonds that will be paid off using the revenue generated by oil and gas wells. These are examples of asset-backed securities. The income from a specified group of assets is used to service the debt. More conventional asset-backed securities are mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by auto or credit card loans, as we discussed in Chapter 2.

Catastrophe Bonds Oriental Land Co., which manages Tokyo Disneyland, has issued bonds with a final payment that depends on whether there has been an earthquake near the park. FIFA (the Fédération Internationale de Football Association) once issued catastrophe bonds with payments that would have been halted if terrorism had forced the cancellation of the World Cup. The World Bank has issued "pandemic bonds" in which investors will forfeit their principal if any of six deadly viruses such as Ebola reach a specified contagion level. The bonds raised money for the World Bank's efforts to fight potential pandemics, but they will relieve the Bank of its payment burden if it is overwhelmed with expenses from disease outbreaks.

These bonds are a way to transfer "catastrophe risk" to the capital markets. Investors in these bonds receive compensation in the form of higher coupon rates for taking on the risk. But in the event of a catastrophe, the bondholders will lose all or part of their investments. "Disaster" can be defined either by total insured losses or by specific criteria such as wind speed in a hurricane, Richter level in an earthquake, or contagion level as in the pandemic bonds. Issuance of catastrophe bonds has grown in recent years as insurers have sought ways to spread their risks across a wider spectrum of the capital market. More than 100 billion of various catastrophe bonds were outstanding in 2021.

Indexed Bonds Indexed bonds make payments that are tied to a general price index or the price of a particular commodity. For example, Mexico has issued bonds with payments that depend on the price of oil. Some bonds are indexed to the general price level. The U.S. Treasury started issuing such inflation-indexed bonds in January 1997. They are called Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). By tying the par value of the bond to the general level of prices, coupon payments as well as the final repayment of par value on these bonds increase in direct proportion to the Consumer Price Index. Therefore, the interest rate on these bonds is a risk-free real rate.

To illustrate how TIPS work, consider a newly issued bond with a 3-year maturity, par value of  \$1,000, and a coupon rate of 4\%$ . For simplicity, we will assume the bond makes annual coupon payments. Assume that inflation turns out to be  $2\%$ ,  $3\%$ , and  $1\%$  in the next three years. Table 14.1 shows how the bond's cash flows will be calculated. The first payment comes at the end of the first year, at  $t = 1$ . Because inflation over the year was  $2\%$ , the par value of the bond increases from 1,000 to \$1,020. The  $4\%$  coupon payment is therefore .04 × $1,020 = $40.80. Notice that par value increases by the inflation rate, and because the coupon payments are  $4\%$  of par, they too increase in proportion to the general price level. Therefore, the cash flows paid by the bond are fixed in real terms. When the bond matures, the investor receives a final coupon payment of \$42.44 plus the (price-level-indexed) repayment of principal, 1,061.11.

Table 14.1
Principal and interest payments for a Treasury Inflation Protected Security

<table><tr><td>Time</td><td>Inflation in Year Just Ended</td><td>Par Value</td><td>Coupon Payment</td><td>+</td><td>Principal Repayment</td><td>=</td><td>Total Payment</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td></td><td>$1,000.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>2\%</td><td>1,020.00</td><td>$40.80</td><td></td><td>$ 0</td><td></td><td>$ 40.80</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>1,050.60</td><td>42.02</td><td></td><td>0</td><td></td><td>42.02</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1,061.11</td><td>42.44</td><td></td><td>1,061.11</td><td></td><td>1,103.55</td></tr></table>

The nominal rate of return on the bond in the first year is

$$
\text {Nominal return} = \frac {\text {Interest} + \text {Price appreciation}}{\text {Initial price}} = \frac {40.80 + 20}{1,000} = 6.08 \%
$$

The real rate of return is precisely the  $4\%$  real yield on the bond:

$$
\text{Real return} = \frac {1 + \text {Nominal return}}{1 + \text {Inflation}} - 1 = \frac {1.0608}{1.02} - 1 = .04, \text {or} 4 \%
$$

One can show in a similar manner (see Problem 18 in the end-of-chapter problems) that the rate of return in each of the three years is  $4\%$  as long as the real yield on the bond remains constant. If real yields do change, then there will be capital gains or losses on the bond. In mid-2022, the real yield on 10-year TIPS bonds was a bit higher than  $5\%$ .

# 14.2 Bond Pricing

A bond's coupon and principal repayments all occur months or years in the future. Therefore, the price an investor is willing to pay for the bond depends on the value of dollars to be received in the future compared to dollars in hand today. This "present value" calculation depends in turn on market interest rates. As we saw in Chapter 5, the nominal risk-free interest rate equals the sum of (1) a real risk-free rate of return and (2) a premium above the real rate to compensate for expected inflation. In addition, because most bonds are not riskless, the discount rate will embody an additional premium that reflects bond-specific characteristics such as default risk, liquidity, tax attributes, call risk, and so on.

We simplify for now by assuming there is one interest rate that is appropriate for discounting cash flows of any maturity, but we can relax this assumption easily. In practice, there may be different discount rates for cash flows accruing in different periods. For the time being, however, we ignore this refinement.

To value a security, we discount its expected cash flows by the appropriate discount rate. Bond cash flows consist of coupon payments until the maturity date plus the final payment of par value. Therefore, the present value of all payments is:

Bond value  $=$  Present value of coupons  $^+$  Present value of par value

This present value is the equilibrium price at which we should expect the bond to sell.

If we call the maturity date  $T$  and call the interest rate appropriate for discounting that bond's payments  $r$ , the present value can be written as

$$
\text {B o n d v a l u e} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \frac {\text {C o u p o n}}{(1 + r) ^ {t}} + \frac {\text {P a r v a l u e}}{(1 + r) ^ {T}} \tag {14.1}
$$

The summation sign in Equation 14.1 directs us to add the present value of each coupon payment; each coupon is discounted based on the time until it will be paid. The first term on the right-hand side of Equation 14.1 is the present value of an annuity. The second term is the present value of a single amount, the final payment of the bond's par value.

A word about terminology. It is common to refer to  $r$  as the market interest rate. In reality, of course, each bond will have its own appropriate discount rate depending on its risk, maturity, liquidity, and so on, so  $r$  really should be interpreted as an equilibrium rate for each specific bond. Because these rates all move together, however, use of the abstract notion of "a" market interest rate is usually acceptable. We will see in the next section that each particular bond's discount rate is usually measured by its yield to maturity, which is the discount rate at which the bond's price equals the present value of its cash flows.

You may recall from an introductory finance class that the present value of a 1 annuity that lasts for T periods when the interest rate equals r is \frac{1}{r} \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^T} \right]. We call this expression the T-period annuity factor for an interest rate of r. Similarly, we call \frac{1}{(1 + r)^T} the PV factor, that is, the present value of a single payment of 1 to be received in T periods. Therefore, we can write the rewrite Equation 14.1 for the value of the bond as

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {V a l u e} = \text {C o u p o n} \times \frac {1}{r} \left[ 1 - \frac {1}{(1 + r) ^ {T}} \right] + \text {P a r v a l u e} \times \frac {1}{(1 + r) ^ {T}} \tag {14.2} \\ = \text {C o u p o n} \times \text {A n n u i t y f a c t o r} (r, T) + \text {P a r v a l u e} \times \text {P V f a c t o r} (r, T) \\ \end{array}
$$

# Example 14.2 Bond Pricing

We discussed earlier an  $8 \%$ coupon, 30- year maturity bond with par value of  \$1,000 paying 60 semiannual coupon payments of\$ 40 each. Suppose that the interest rate is  $8 \%$ annually, or  $r = 4 \%$  per six- month period. Then the value of the bond can be written as

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {B o n d V a l u e} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {6 0} \frac {\mathbb {S} 4 0}{(1 . 0 4) ^ {t}} + \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 , 0 0 0}{(1 . 0 4) ^ {6 0}} \tag {14.3} \\ = \ 40 \times \text{Annuity factor} (4\% ,60) + \ 1,000 \times \text{PV factor} (4\% ,60)$ \\ \end{array}
$$

It is easy to confirm that the present value of the bond's 60 semiannual coupon payments of  \$40 each is\$ 904.94 and that the \$1,000 final payment of par value has a present value of \$95.06, for a total bond value of 1,000. You can calculate this value directly from Equation 14.2, perform these calculations on any financial calculator (see Example 14.3), use a spreadsheet program (see column F of Spreadsheet 14.1), or use a set of present value tables.

In this example, the coupon rate equals the market interest rate, and the bond should sell at par value. If the interest rate were not equal to the bond's coupon rate, the bond would

4Here is a quick derivation of the formula for the present value of an annuity. An annuity lasting T periods can be viewed as equivalent to a perpetuity whose first payment comes at the end of the current period less another perpetuity whose first payment comes at the end of the (T + 1)\mathrm{st} period. The immediate perpetuity net of the delayed perpetuity provides exactly T payments. We know that the value of a \1 per period perpetuity is \1/r. Therefore, the present value of the delayed perpetuity is \1/r discounted for T additional periods, or \frac{1}{r} \times \frac{1}{(1 + r)^T}.

The present value of the annuity is the present value of the first perpetuity minus the present value of the delayed perpetuity, or  $\frac{1}{r}\left[1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^T}\right]$ .

not sell at par. For example, if the interest rate rises to  $10\%$  (5\% per six months), the bond's present value will fall by \$189.29 to \$ 810.71, as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \$ 40 \times Annuity factor (5 \%, 60) + \$ 1,000 \times PV factor (5 \%, 60) \\ = \$ 7 5 7. 1 7 + \$ 5 3. 5 4 = \$ 8 1 0. 7 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

At a higher discount rate, the present value of the payments (and therefore, the equilibrium bond price) is lower. Therefore, bond prices fall as market interest rates rise. This illustrates a crucial general rule in bond valuation.

Bond values are tedious to calculate without a spreadsheet or a financial calculator, but they are easy to calculate with either. Financial calculators designed with present and future value formulas already programmed can greatly simplify calculations of the sort we just encountered in Example 14.2. The basic financial calculator uses five keys that correspond to the inputs for time-value-of-money problems such as bond pricing:

1.  $n$  is the number of time periods. For a bond,  $n$  equals the number of periods until maturity. If the bond makes semiannual payments,  $n$  is the number of half-year periods or, equivalently, the number of semiannual coupon payments. For example, if the bond has 10 years until maturity, you would enter 20 for  $n$  because each payment period is one-half year.
2.  $i$  is the interest rate per period, expressed as a percentage (not as a decimal). For example, if the interest rate is  $6\%$ , you would enter 6, not .06.
3. PV is the present value. Many calculators require that PV be entered as a negative number because the purchase of the bond entails a cash outflow, while the receipt of coupon payments and face value are cash inflows.
4.  $FV$  is the future value or face value of the bond. In general, FV is interpreted as a one-time future cash flow, which, for bonds, is the face (i.e., par) value.
5. PMT is the amount of any recurring payment. For coupon bonds, PMT is the coupon payment; for zero-coupon bonds, PMT is zero.

Given any four of these inputs, the calculator will solve for the fifth. We can illustrate with the bond presented in Example 14.2.

# Example 14.3 Bond Pricing on a Financial Calculator

To find the bond value when the annual market interest rate is  $8\%$ , you would enter these inputs (in any order): n 60 The bond has a maturity of 30 years, so it makes 60 semiannual payments.


i 4 The semiannual market interest rate is  $4\%$

FV 1,000 The bond will provide a one-time cash flow of 1,000 when it matures.

PMT 40 Each semiannual coupon payment is 40.

Here is a trap to avoid. You should not confuse the bond's coupon rate, which determines the interest paid to the bondholder, with the market interest rate. Once a bond is issued, its coupon rate is fixed. When the market interest rate increases, investors discount any fixed payments at a higher discount rate, which implies that present values and bond prices fall.

On most calculators, you now punch the "compute" key (labeled COMP or CPT) and then enter PV to obtain the present value today of the bond's cash flows. If you do this, you should find a value of  $-1,000$ . The negative sign signifies that while the investor receives cash flows from the bond, the price you must pay to buy the bond is a cash outflow, or a negative cash flow.

If you want to find the value of the bond when the interest rate is  $10\%$  (the second part of Example 14.2), just enter  $5\%$  for the semiannual interest rate (type "5" and then "i"), and when you compute PV, you will find that it is  $-810.71$ .

Figure 14.3 shows the value of the 30-year,  $8\%$  coupon bond for a range of interest rates, including  $8\%$ , at which the bond will sell at par, and  $10\%$ , at which it will sell for 810.71. The negative slope illustrates the inverse relationship between bond values and the interest rate. The shape of the curve in Figure 14.3 implies that an increase in the interest rate results in a smaller decline in value than the increase resulting from a rate decrease of equal magnitude. This property is called convexity because of the convex shape of the valuation curve. This curvature reflects the fact that progressive increases in the interest rate result in progressively smaller reductions in bond value. Therefore, the curve becomes flatter at higher interest rates. We return to convexity in Chapter 16.

# Concept Check 14.2

Calculate the value of the 30-year,  $8\%$  coupon bond if the market interest rate falls from  $4\%$  to  $3\%$  per half-year. Compare the increase in value when the interest rate falls from  $4\%$  to  $3\%$  to the loss of value when the rate increases from  $4\%$  to  $5\%$ .

Corporate bonds typically are issued at par value. This means that the underwriters of the bond issue (the firms that market the bonds to the public for the issuing corporation) must choose a coupon rate that very closely approximates market yields. If the coupon rate is inadequate, investors will not be willing to pay par value for the bond.

After the bonds are issued, bondholders may buy or sell bonds in secondary markets. In these markets, bond values (and therefore prices) fluctuate inversely with the market interest rate.

The inverse relationship between price and the interest rate is a central feature of fixed-income securities. Interest rate fluctuations represent the main source of risk in the fixed-income market, and we devote considerable attention in Chapter 16 to assessing the sensitivity of bond value to

For now, however, we simply highlight one key factor that determines that sensitivity, namely, the maturity of the bond.


As a general rule, keeping all other factors the same, the longer the maturity of the bond, the greater the sensitivity of value to fluctuations in the interest rate. For example, consider Table 14.2, which presents the value of an  $8\%$  coupon bond at different market yields and times to maturity. For any departure of the interest rate from  $8\%$  (the rate at which the bond should sell at par value), the change in value is greater for longer times to maturity.

This makes sense. If you buy the bond at par with an  $8\%$  coupon rate, and market rates subsequently rise, then you suffer a loss: You have tied up your money earning  $8\%$  when alternative investments offer higher returns. The bond is now worth less than you paid for it. The longer the period for which your money is tied up, the greater the loss, and correspondingly the greater the drop in the bond price. In Table 14.2, the row for 1-year maturity bonds shows little price sensitivity—that is, with only one year's earnings at stake, changes in interest rates are not too threatening. But for 30-year maturity bonds, interest rate swings have a large impact on value. The force of discounting is greatest for the longest-term bonds.

This is why short-term Treasury securities such as T-bills are considered to be the safest. In addition to being free of default risk, they are also largely free of price risk attributable to interest rate volatility.

# Bond Pricing between Coupon Dates

Equation 14.2 assumes that the next coupon payment is in precisely one payment period, either a year for an annual payment bond or six months for a semiannual payment bond. But you probably want to be able to value bonds all 365 days of the year, not just on the one or two dates each year that it makes a coupon payment!

In principle, the fact that the bond is between coupon dates does not affect the valuation problem. The procedure is always the same: Compute the present value of each remaining payment and sum up. But if you are between coupon dates, there will be fractional periods remaining until each payment, and this does complicate the arithmetic computations.

Fortunately, bond pricing functions are included in most spreadsheet programs such as Excel. The spreadsheet allows you to enter today's date as well as the maturity date of the bond and so can provide equilibrium bond prices for any date. The nearby box shows you how.

As we pointed out earlier, bond prices are typically quoted net of accrued interest. These prices, which appear in the financial press, are called flat prices. The invoice price a buyer actually pays for the bond includes accrued interest. Thus,

$$
\text {I n v o i c e} = \text {F l a t} + \text {A c c r u e d}
$$

When a bond pays its coupon, flat price equals invoice price because at that moment, accrued interest reverts to zero. However, this will be the exception, not the rule.

Excel pricing functions provide the flat price of the bond. To find the invoice price, we need to add accrued interest. Fortunately, Excel also provides functions that count the days since the last coupon payment date and thus can be used to compute accrued interest. The nearby box also illustrates how to use these functions. The box provides examples using a bond that has just paid a coupon, and so has zero accrued interest, as well as a bond that is between coupon dates.

# 14.3 Bond Yields

Most bonds do not sell for par value. But ultimately, barring default, they will mature to par value. Therefore, we would like a measure of rate of return that accounts for both current income and the price increase or decrease over the bond's life. The yield to maturity is the standard measure of the total rate of return. However, it is far from perfect, and we will explore several variations of this measure.

# Yield to Maturity

In practice, an investor considering the purchase of a bond is not quoted a promised rate of return. Instead, one must use the bond price, maturity date, and coupon payments to infer the return offered over the bond's life. The yield to maturity (YTM) is defined as the interest rate that makes the present value of a bond's payments equal to its price. It is often interpreted as a measure of the average rate of return that will be earned on a bond if it is bought now and held until maturity. To calculate the yield to maturity, we solve the bond valuation equation for the interest rate given the bond's price.

# Example 14.4 Yield to Maturity

Suppose an  $8 \%$ coupon, 30- year bond is selling at \$1,276.76. What average rate of return would be earned by an investor purchasing the bond at this price? We find the interest rate at which the present value of the remaining 60 semiannual payments equals the bond price. This is the rate consistent with the observed price of the bond. Therefore, we solve for  $r$  in the following equation:

Price = Present Value

$$
\$ 1,276.76 = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {6 0} \frac {\$ 4 0}{(1 + r) ^ {t}} + \frac {\$ 1 , 0 0 0}{(1 + r) ^ {6 0}}
$$

$$
1, 2 7 6. 7 6 = 4 0 \times \text {A n n u i t y f a c t o r} (r, 6 0) + 1, 0 0 0 \times \text {P V f a c t o r} (r, 6 0)
$$

These equations have only one unknown variable, the interest rate,  $r$ . As we will see in a moment, you can use a financial calculator or spreadsheet to confirm that the solution is  $r = .03$ , or  $3\%$ , per half-year. This is the bond's yield to maturity.

The financial press annualizes the semiannual yield using simple interest techniques, resulting in an annual percentage rate, or APR. Yields annualized using simple interest are also called "bond equivalent yields." Therefore, the semiannual yield would be doubled and reported as a bond equivalent yield of  $6\%$ .

The effective annual yield of the bond, in contrast, accounts for compound interest. If one earns  $3\%$  interest every six months, then after one year, each dollar invested grows with interest to  $\$1 \times (1.03)^2 = \$1.0609$ , and the effective annual interest rate on the bond is  $6.09\%$ .

In Example 14.4, we noted that a financial calculator or spreadsheet can be used to find the yield to maturity on the coupon bond. Here are two examples demonstrating how

Excel and most other spreadsheet programs provide built-in functions to compute bond prices and yields. They typically ask you to input both the date you buy the bond (called the settlement date) and the maturity date of the bond. The Excel function for the bond's value is

= PRICE(settlement date, maturity date, annual coupon rate, yield to maturity, redemption value as percent of par value, number of coupon payments per year)

For the  $2.25\%$  coupon August 2049 maturity bond highlighted in Figure 14.1, we would enter the values in Spreadsheet 14.1, Column B (Notice that in spreadsheets, we must enter interest rates as decimals, not percentages). Alternatively, we could simply enter the following function in Excel:

= PRICE(DATE(2021,8,15), DATE(2049,8,15), .0225, .01938, 100, 2)

The DATE function in Excel, which we use for both the settlement and maturity dates, uses the format DATE(year,month,day). The first date is August 15, 2021, when the bond is purchased, and the second is August 15, 2049, when it matures. Most bonds pay coupons either on the 15th or the last business day of the month.

Notice that the coupon rate and yield to maturity are expressed as decimals, not percentages. In most cases, redemption value is 100 (i.e.,  $100\%$  of par value), and the resulting price similarly is expressed as a percent of par value. Occasionally, however, you may encounter bonds that pay off at a premium or discount to par value. One example would be callable bonds, discussed shortly.

The value of the bond returned by the pricing function is 106.7176 (cell B12), which is within one cent of the ask price reported in Table 14.1. (The yield to maturity is reported to only three decimal places, which results in a little rounding error.) This bond has just paid a coupon. In other words, the settlement date is precisely at the beginning of the coupon period, so no adjustment for accrued interest is necessary.


To illustrate the procedure for bonds between coupon payments, consider the  $3\%$  coupon November 2044 bond, also appearing in Figure 14.1. Using the entries in column D of the spreadsheet, we find in cell D12 that the (flat) price of the bond is 120.5103, which matches the ask price given in the figure except for trivial rounding error.

What about the bond's invoice price? Rows 13 through 16 make the necessary adjustments. The function described in cell C13 counts the days since the last coupon. This day count is based on the bond's settlement date, maturity date, coupon period (1 = annual; 2 = semiannual), and day count convention (choice 1 uses actual days). The function described in cell C14 counts the total days in each coupon payment period. Therefore, the entries for accrued interest in row 15 are the semiannual coupon multiplied by the fraction of a coupon period that has elapsed since the last payment. Finally, the invoice price in row 16 is the sum of the flat price plus accrued interest.

As a final example, suppose you wish to find the price of the bond in Example 14.2. It is a 30-year maturity bond with a coupon rate of  $8\%$  (paid semiannually). The market interest rate given in the latter part of the example is  $10\%$ . However, you are not given a specific settlement or maturity date. You can still use the PRICE function to value the bond. Simply choose an arbitrary settlement date (January 1, 2000, is convenient) and let the maturity date be 30 years hence. The appropriate inputs appear in column F of the spreadsheet, with the resulting price,  $81.0707\%$  of face value, appearing in cell F16.

# Example 14.5 Finding the Yield to Maturity Using a Financial Calculator n 60 The bond has a maturity of 30 years, so it makes 60 semiannual payments.


PMT 40 Each semiannual coupon payment is 40.

PV  $(-)1,276.76$  The bond can be purchased for  $1,276.76$ , which on some calculators must be entered as a negative number as it is a cash outflow.

FV 1,000 The bond will provide a one-time cash flow of 1,000 when it matures.

Given these inputs, you now use the calculator to find the interest rate at which  \$1,276.76 actually equals the present value of the 60 payments of\$ 40 plus the one-time payment of 1,000 at maturity. On some calculators, you first punch the "compute" key (labeled COMP or CPT) and then enter i. You should find that i = 3, or 3\% semiannually, as we claimed. Notice that just as the cash flows are paid semiannually, the computed interest rate is a rate per semi-annual time period. The bond equivalent yield will be reported in the financial press as 6\%.

Excel also contains built-in functions that you can use to find yield to maturity. Example 14.6, along with Spreadsheet 14.2, illustrates these functions.

# Example 14.6 Finding Yield to Maturity Using Excel

Excel's function for yield to maturity is:

= YIELD(settlement date, maturity date, annual coupon rate, bond price, redemption value as percent of par value, number of coupon payments per year)

The bond price used in the function should be the reported, or "flat," price, without accrued interest. For example, to find the yield to maturity of the semiannual payment bond in Example 14.4, we would use column B of Spreadsheet 14.2. If the coupons were paid only annually, we would change the entry for payments per year to 1 (see cell D8), and the yield would fall slightly to  $5.99\%$ .

Finding yield to maturity in Excel

The yield to maturity is the internal rate of return on an investment in the bond. It can be interpreted as the compound rate of return over the life of the bond under the assumption that all bond coupons can be reinvested at that yield and is therefore widely accepted as a proxy for average return.

Yield to maturity differs from the current yield of a bond, which is the bond's annual coupon payment divided by its price. The current yield of the  $8\%$ , 30-year bond selling at \$1,276.76 is \$ 80/\$1,276.76 = .0627, or 6.27\%$ , per year. In contrast, we just saw that the effective annual yield to maturity is  $6.09\%$ . For this bond, which is selling at a premium over par value (1,276 rather than \$1,000), the coupon rate (8\%) exceeds the current yield (6.27\%), which exceeds the yield to maturity (6.09\%). The coupon rate exceeds current yield because the coupon rate divides the coupon payments by par value (\$ 1,000), which is less than the bond price ( \$1,276). In turn, the current yield exceeds yield to maturity because the yield to maturity accounts for the built-in capital loss on the bond; the bond bought today for \$ 1,276 will eventually fall in value to \$1,000 at maturity.

Examples 14.4, 14.5, and 14.6 illustrate a general rule: For premium bonds (bonds selling above par value), coupon rate is greater than current yield, which in turn is greater than yield to maturity. For discount bonds (bonds selling below par value), these relationships are reversed (see Concept Check 14.3).

It is common to hear people talking loosely about the yield on a bond. In these cases, they almost always are referring to the yield to maturity.

# Concept Check 14.3

What will be the relationship among coupon rate, current yield, and yield to maturity for bonds selling at discounts from par? Illustrate using the 30-year maturity,  $8\%$  (semiannual payment) coupon bond, assuming it is selling at a yield to maturity of  $10\%$ .

# Yield to Call

Yield to maturity is calculated on the assumption that the bond will be held until maturity. What if the bond is callable, however, and may be retired prior to the maturity date?

Figure 14.4 illustrates the risk of call to the bondholder. The top curve is the value of a "straight" (i.e., noncallable) bond with par value 1,000, an 8\% coupon rate, and a 30-year time to maturity as a function of the market interest rate. If interest rates fall, the bond price, which equals the present value of the promised payments, can rise substantially.

Now consider a bond that has the same coupon rate and maturity date but is callable at  $110\%$  of par value, or 1,100. When interest rates fall, the present value of the bond's scheduled payments rises, but the call provision allows the issuer to repurchase the bond at the call price. If the call price is less than the present value of the scheduled payments, the issuer may call the bond back from the bondholder.

The lower curve in Figure 14.4 is the value of the callable bond. At high interest rates, the risk of call is negligible because the present value of scheduled payments is less than the call price; therefore the values of the straight and callable bonds converge. At lower rates, however, the values of the bonds begin to diverge, with the difference reflecting the value of the firm's option to reclaim the callable bond at the call price. At very low rates, the present value of scheduled payments significantly exceeds the call price, so the bond is called. Its value at this point is simply the call price, 1,100.


This analysis suggests that investors might be more interested in a bond's yield to call than its yield to maturity, especially if the bond is likely to be called. The yield to call is calculated just like the yield to maturity except that the time until call replaces time until maturity, and the call price replaces par value. This computation is sometimes called "yield to first call," as it assumes the issuer will call the bond as soon as it may do so.

# Example 14.7 Yield to Call

Suppose the  $8 \%$ coupon, 30- year- maturity bond sells for \$1,150 and is callable in 10 years at a call price of \$1,100. Its yield to maturity and yield to call would be calculated using the following inputs:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Yield to Call</td><td>Yield to Maturity</td></tr><tr><td>Coupon payment</td><td>$40</td><td>$40</td></tr><tr><td>Number of semiannual periods</td><td>20 periods</td><td>60 periods</td></tr><tr><td>Final payment</td><td>$1,100</td><td>$1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>$1,150</td><td>$1,150</td></tr></table>

Yield to call is then  $6.64\%$ . [To confirm this on a calculator, input  $n = 20$ ;  $\mathrm{PV} = (-)1150$ ;  $\mathrm{FV} = 1100$ ;  $\mathrm{PMT} = 40$ ; compute  $i$  as  $3.32\%$ , or  $6.64\%$  bond equivalent yield.] Yield to maturity is  $6.82\%$ . [To confirm, input  $n = 60$ ;  $\mathrm{PV} = (-)1150$ ;  $\mathrm{FV} = 1000$ ;  $\mathrm{PMT} = 40$ ; compute  $i$  as  $3.41\%$ , or  $6.82\%$  bond equivalent yield.] In Excel, you can calculate yield to call as  $= \mathrm{YIELD(DATE(2000,1,1), DATE(2010,1,1), .08, 115, 110, 2)}$ . Notice that redemption value is input as  $110$ , that is,  $110\%$  of par value.

While most callable bonds are issued with an initial period of explicit call protection, an additional implicit form of call protection operates for bonds selling at deep discounts from their call prices. Even if interest rates fall a bit, deep-discount bonds still will sell below the call price and thus will not be vulnerable to a call.

Premium bonds selling near their call prices are especially apt to be called if rates fall further. If interest rates fall, a callable premium bond is likely to provide a lower return than could be earned on a discount bond whose potential price appreciation is not limited by the likelihood of a call. This is why investors in premium bonds may be most interested in yield to call.

Figure 14.5 Growth of invested funds

# Realized Compound Return versus Yield to Maturity

Yield to maturity will equal the rate of return realized over the life of the bond if all coupons are reinvested and earn the bond's yield to maturity. Consider, for example, a 2-year bond selling at par value paying a  $10\%$  coupon once a year. The yield to maturity is  $10\%$ . If the  $\$100$  coupon payment is reinvested at an interest rate of  $10\%$ , the  $\$1,000$  investment in the bond will grow after two years to  $\$1,210$ , as illustrated in Figure 14.5, Panel A. The coupon paid in the first year is reinvested and grows with interest to a second-year value of  $\$110$ , which together with the second coupon payment and payment of par value in the second year results in a total value of  $\$1,210$ .

To summarize, the initial value of the investment is  $V_{0} = \1,000$ . The final value in two years is  $V_{2} = \$ 1,210 . The compound rate of return, therefore, is calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} V _ {0} (1 + r) ^ {2} = V _ {2} \\ \$ 1,000 (1 + r) ^ {2} = \$ 1,210 \\ r = .10 = 10\% \\ \end{array}
$$

With a reinvestment rate equal to the  $10\%$  yield to maturity, the realized compound return also equals yield to maturity.

But what if the reinvestment rate is not  $10\%$ ? If the coupon can be invested at more than  $10\%$ , funds will grow to more than \$1,210, and the realized compound return will exceed  $10\%$ . If the reinvestment rate is less than  $10\%$ , so will be the realized compound return. Consider the following example.

# Example 14.8 Realized Compound Return

Suppose the interest rate at which the coupon can be invested is only  $8\%$ . The following calculations are illustrated in Figure 14.5, Panel B.

Future value of first coupon payment with interest earnings = \ 100 \times 1.08 = \ 108\$
+ Cash payment in second year (final coupon plus par value) 1,100
= Total value of investment with reinvested coupons 1,208

The realized compound return is the compound rate of growth of invested funds, assuming that all coupon payments are reinvested. The investor purchased the bond for par at  \$1,000, and this investment grew to\$ 1,208. So the realized compound yield is less than 10\%:

$$
\begin{array}{l} V _ {0} (1 + r) ^ {2} = V _ {2} \\ \$ 1,000 (1 + r) ^ {2} = \$ 1,208 \\ r = .0991 = 9.91 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

Example 14.8 highlights the problem with conventional yield to maturity when reinvestment rates can change over time. Conventional yield to maturity will not equal realized compound return. However, with future interest rate uncertainty, the rates at which interim coupons will be reinvested are not yet known. Therefore, although realized compound return can be computed after the investment period, it cannot be computed in advance without a forecast of future reinvestment rates. This reduces much of the attraction of the realized return measure.

Forecasting the realized compound yield over various investment periods is called horizon analysis. The forecast of total return depends on your forecasts of both the price of the bond when you sell it at the end of your horizon and the rate at which you are able to reinvest coupon income. The sales price depends in turn on the yield to maturity at the horizon date. With a longer investment horizon, however, reinvested coupons will be a larger component of final proceeds.

# Example 14.9 Horizon Analysis

Suppose you buy a 30-year, 7.5\% (annual payment) coupon bond for \$980 (when its yield to maturity is 7.67\%) and plan to hold it for 20 years. You forecast that the bond's yield to maturity will be 8\% when it is sold and that the reinvestment rate on the coupons will be 6\%. At the end of your investment horizon, the bond will have 10 years remaining until maturity, so the forecast sales price (using a yield to maturity of 8\%) is \$966.45. The 20 coupon payments will grow with compound interest to \$2,758.92. (This is the future value of a 20-year \$75 annuity with an interest rate of 6\%).

On the basis of these forecasts, your  \$980 investment will grow in 20 years to$ 966.45 +  $2,758.92 =\$ 3,725.37. This corresponds to an annualized compound return of 6.90\%:

$$
\begin{array}{l} V _ {0} (1 + r) ^ {2 0} = V _ {2 0} \\ \mathbb {S} 9 8 0 (1 + r) ^ {2 0} = \mathbb {S} 3, 7 2 5. 3 7 \\ r = .0690 = 6.90\% \\ \end{array}
$$

Examples 14.8 and 14.9 demonstrate that as interest rates change, bond investors are subject to two offsetting sources of risk. On the one hand, when rates rise, bond prices fall, which reduces the value of the portfolio. On the other hand, reinvested coupon income will compound more rapidly at those higher rates. This reinvestment rate risk offsets price risk. In Chapter 16, we will explore this trade-off in more detail and will discover that by carefully tailoring their bond portfolios, investors can precisely balance these two effects for any given investment horizon.

# 14.4 Bond Prices over Time

A bond will sell at par value when its coupon rate equals the market interest rate. In this case, the coupon payments are sufficient to provide fair compensation for the time value of money.

When the coupon rate is lower than the market interest rate, the coupon payments alone will not provide bond investors as high a return as they could earn elsewhere. To receive a competitive return, they also need some price appreciation. The bonds, therefore, must sell below par value to provide a "built-in" capital gain on the investment.

# Example 14.10 Fair Holding-Period Return

Suppose a bond was issued several years ago when the interest rate was  $7\%$ . The bond's annual coupon rate was thus set at  $7\%$ . (We suppose for simplicity that the bond pays its coupon annually.) Now, with three years left in the bond's life, the market interest rate is  $8\%$  per year. The bond's market price is the present value of the remaining annual coupons plus payment of par value. That present value is

$$
\$ 70 \times Annuity factor(8\%, 3) + \$ 1,000 \times PV factor(8\%, 3) = \$ 974.23
$$ which is less than par value.


In another year, after the next coupon is paid and remaining maturity falls to two years, the bond will sell at

$$
\$ 70 \times Annuity factor(8\%, 2) + \$ 1,000 \times PV factor(8\%, 2) = \$ 982.17
$$ thereby providing a capital gain over the year of  \$7.94. If an investor had purchased the bond at\$ 974.23, the total return over the year would equal the coupon payment plus capital gain, or  $70 +$ 7.94 = \$77.94. This represents a rate of return of  \$77.94/974.23, or 8\%, exactly the rate of return currently available elsewhere in the market.

# Concept Check 14.5

At what price will the bond in Example 14.10 sell in yet another year, when only one year remains until maturity? Assume the yield to maturity remains at  $8\%$ . What is the rate of return to an investor who purchases the bond when its price is 982.17 and sells it one year hence?

When bond prices are set according to the present value formula, any discount from par value provides an anticipated capital gain that will augment a below-market coupon rate by just enough to provide a competitive (i.e., market) total rate of return. Conversely, if the coupon rate exceeds the market interest rate, the interest income by itself is greater than that available elsewhere in the market. Investors will bid up the bond price above par value. As the bond approaches maturity, its price will fall because fewer of these above-market coupon payments remain. The resulting capital loss offsets the large coupon payments so that the bondholder again receives only a competitive rate of return.


Problem 14 at the end of the chapter asks you to work through the case of the high-coupon bond. Figure 14.6 traces out the price paths (net of accrued interest) of two 30-year bonds, each selling at a yield to maturity of  $8\%$ . One is a premium bond with a coupon rate above its  $8\%$  yield to maturity, while the other is a discount bond, with a coupon rate below yield to maturity. As time passes and the bonds approach their maturity dates, their prices steadily close in on par value. This means that the discount bond will enjoy capital gains that offset its relatively low coupon rate, while the premium bond will suffer capital losses that offset a portion of its generous coupon.[9]

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/dd4ea2c8cd966c0074e09ba8a9049311029d00ac5bcc3787916a70ff9ea2d3c5.jpg)
Figure 14.6 Price path of two 30-year maturity bonds, each selling at a yield to maturity of  $8\%$ . Bond price approaches par value as maturity date approaches.


We conclude that each bond offers investors the same total rate of return. Although the capital gains versus income components differ, the price of each bond is set to provide competitive rates, as we should expect in well-functioning capital markets. Security returns all should be comparable on an after-tax risk-adjusted basis. If they are not, investors will try to sell low-return securities, thereby driving down their prices until the total return at the now-lower price is competitive with other securities. Prices should continue to adjust until all expected returns are comparable, given appropriate risk and tax adjustments.

We see evidence of this price adjustment in Figure 14.1. Compare the two bonds maturing in August 2040. One has a coupon rate of  $3.875\%$ , while the other's coupon rate is less than one-third of that value, only  $1.125\%$ . But the higher coupon rate on the first bond does not mean that it offers a higher return; instead, it sells at a higher price. The yields to maturity on the two bonds are very similar, both close to  $1.8\%$ . This makes sense because investors should care about their total return, including both coupon income as well as price change. In the end, prices of similar-maturity bonds adjust until yields are pretty much equalized.

Of course, the yields across bonds in Figure 14.1 are not all precisely equal. Clearly, longer-term bonds at this time offered higher promised yields, a common pattern and one that reflects the relative risks of the bonds. We will explore the relationship between yield and time to maturity in the next chapter.

We assume in the figure that the market interest rate is constant. If the market interest rate is volatile, the price path will be "jumpy," vibrating around the price path in Figure 14.6 and reflecting capital gains or losses as interest rates fluctuate. Ultimately, however, the price must reach par value at the maturity date, so the price of the premium bond will fall over time while that of the discount bond will rise.

# Yield to Maturity versus Holding-Period Return

In Example 14.10, the holding-period return and the yield to maturity were equal. The bond yield started and ended the year at  $8\%$ , and the bond's holding-period return also equaled  $8\%$ . This turns out to be a general result. When the yield to maturity is unchanged over the period, the rate of return on the bond will equal that yield. As we learned from Example 14.10, this should not be surprising: The bond must offer a rate of return competitive with those available on other securities.

However, when yields fluctuate, so will a bond's rate of return. Unanticipated changes in market rates will result in unanticipated changes in bond prices and, after the fact, a bond's holding-period return can be better or worse than the yield at which it initially sells. An increase in the bond's yield acts to reduce its price, which reduces the holding-period return. In this event, the holding-period return is likely to be less than the initial yield to maturity.[10] Conversely, a decline in yield will result in a holding-period return greater than the initial yield.

# Example 14.11 Yield to Maturity versus Holding-Period Return

Consider a 30-year bond paying an annual coupon of \$80 and selling at par value of \$1,000. The bond's initial yield to maturity is 8\%. If the yield remains at 8\% over the year, the bond price will remain at par, so the holding-period return also will be 8\%. But if the yield falls below 8\%, the bond price will increase. Suppose the yield falls and the price increases to 1,050. Then the holding-period return is greater than 8\%:

$$
\text{Holding - period return} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 80 + (\mathbb {S} 1, 050 - \mathbb {S} 1, 000)}{\mathbb {S} 1, 000} = . 1 3, \text {or} 13 \%
$$

# Concept Check 14.6

Show that if yield to maturity increases, then holding-period return is less than initial yield. For example, suppose in Example 14.11 that by the end of the first year, the bond's yield to maturity is  $8.5\%$ . Find the 1-year holding-period return and compare it to the bond's initial  $8\%$  yield to maturity.

Here is another way to think about the difference between yield to maturity and holding-period return. Yield to maturity depends only on the bond's coupon, current price, and par value at maturity. All of these values are observable today, so yield to maturity can be easily calculated. Yield to maturity is commonly interpreted as a measure of the average rate of return if the investment in the bond is held until the bond matures. In contrast, holding-period return is the rate of return over a particular investment period and depends on the market price of the bond at the end of that holding period; this price is not known today. Because bond prices over the holding period will respond to unanticipated changes in interest rates, holding-period return can at most be forecast.

We have to be a bit careful here. When yields increase, coupon income can be reinvested at higher rates, which offsets the impact of the initial price decline. If your holding period is sufficiently long, the positive impact of the higher reinvestment rate can more than offset the initial price decline. But common performance evaluation periods for portfolio managers are no more than one year, and over these shorter horizons the price impact will almost always dominate the impact of the reinvestment rate. We discuss the trade-off between price risk and reinvestment rate risk more fully in Chapter 16.

# Zero-Coupon Bonds and Treasury Strips

Original-issue-discount bonds are less common than coupon bonds issued at par. These are bonds that are issued intentionally with low coupon rates that cause the bond to sell at a discount from par value. The most common example of this type of bond is the zero-coupon bond, which carries no coupons and provides all of its return in the form of price appreciation. Zeros provide only one cash flow to their owners, on the maturity date of the bond.

U.S. Treasury bills are examples of short-term zero-coupon instruments. If the bill has face value of  \$10,000, the Treasury issues or sells it for some amount less than\$ 10,000, agreeing to repay 10,000 at maturity. All of the investor's return comes in the form of price appreciation.

Longer-term zero-coupon bonds are commonly created from coupon-bearing notes and bonds. A bond dealer who purchases a Treasury coupon bond may ask the Treasury to separate the cash flows into a series of independent securities, where each security is a claim to one of the payments of the original bond. For example, a 10-year coupon bond would be "stripped" of its 20 semiannual coupons, and each coupon payment would be treated as a stand-alone zero-coupon bond. The maturities of these bonds would thus range from six months to 10 years. The final payment of principal would be treated as another stand-alone zero-coupon security. Each of the payments is now treated as an independent security and is assigned its own CUSIP number (by the Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures). The CUSIP number is the security identifier that allows for electronic trading over the Fedwire system, a network that connects all Federal Reserve banks and their branches. The payments are still considered obligations of the U.S. Treasury. The Treasury program under which coupon stripping is performed is called STRIPS (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities), and these zero-coupon securities are called Treasury strips.

What should happen to prices of zeros as time passes? On their maturity dates, zeros must sell for par value. Before maturity, however, they should sell at discounts from par because of the time value of money. As time passes, price should approach par value. In fact, if the interest rate is constant, a zero's price will increase at exactly the rate of interest.

To illustrate, consider a zero with 30 years until maturity, and suppose the market interest rate is  $10\%$  per year. The price of the bond today is  $\$1,000 / (1.10)^{30} = \$57.31$ . Next year, with only 29 years until maturity, if the yield is still  $10\%$ , the price will be  $\$1,000 / (1.10)^{29} = \$63.04$ , a  $10\%$  increase over its previous-year value. Because the par value of the bond is now discounted for one less year, its price has increased by the 1-year discount factor.

Figure 14.7 presents the price path of a 30-year zero-coupon bond for an annual market interest rate of  $10\%$ . The bond's price rises exponentially, not linearly, until its maturity.

# After-Tax Returns

The tax authorities recognize that the "built-in" price appreciation on original-issue-discount (OID) bonds such as zero-coupon bonds represents an implicit interest payment to the holder of the security. The IRS, therefore, calculates a price appreciation schedule to impute taxable interest income for the built-in appreciation during a tax year, even if the asset is not sold or does not mature. Any additional gains or losses that arise from changes in market interest rates are treated as capital gains or losses if the OID bond is sold during the tax year.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/cc77b4af9a8426c754db955d5254428e83ea3994c57cce39b9448adbc08bc1f8.jpg)

# Example 14.12 Taxation of Original-Issue-Discount Bonds

Continuing with the example in the text, if the interest rate originally is 10\%, the 30-year zero will be issued at a price of $1,000/1.10³⁰ = $57.31. The following year, the IRS will calculate what the bond price would be if the yield were still 10\%. This is $1,000/1.10²⁹ = $63.04. Therefore, the IRS imputes interest income of $63.04 - $57.31 = 5.73. This amount is subject to tax. Notice that the imputed interest income is based on a "constant yield method" that ignores any changes in market interest rates.

If interest rates actually fall, let's say to 9.9\%, next year's bond price will be $1,000/1.099²⁹ = $64.72. If the bond is sold, the difference between \$64.72 and \$63.04 will be treated as capital gains income and taxed at the capital gains tax rate. If the bond is not sold, then the price difference is an unrealized capital gain and will not result in taxes in that year. In either case, the investor must pay taxes on the 5.73 of imputed interest at whatever tax rate applies to interest income.

The procedure illustrated in Example 14.12 applies as well to the taxation of other original-issue-discount bonds, even if they are not zero-coupon bonds. Consider a 30-year-maturity bond issued with a coupon rate of  $4\%$  and a yield to maturity of  $8\%$ . For simplicity, we will assume that the bond pays coupons once annually. Because of the low coupon rate, the bond will be issued at a price far below par value, specifically at \$549.69. If the bond's yield to maturity is still  $8\%$ , then its price in one year will rise to \$553.66. (Confirm this for yourself.) The pretax holding-period return (HPR) is exactly  $8\%$ :

$$
\mathrm {H P R} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 4 0 + (\mathbb {S} 5 5 3 . 6 6 - \mathbb {S} 5 4 9 . 6 9)}{\mathbb {S} 5 4 9 . 6 9} = . 0 8
$$

The increase in the bond price based on a constant yield, however, is treated as interest income, so the investor is required to pay taxes on the explicit coupon income, \$40, as well as the imputed interest income of $553.66 - $549.69 = \$3.97. If the bond's yield actually changes during the year, the difference between the bond's price and the constant-yield value of 553.66 will be treated as capital gains income if the bond is sold.

# Concept Check 14.7

Suppose that the yield to maturity of the  $4\%$  coupon, 30-year-maturity bond falls to  $7\%$  by the end of the first year and that the investor sells the bond after the first year. If the investor's federal plus state tax rate on interest income is  $38\%$  and the combined tax rate on capital gains is  $20\%$ , what is the investor's after-tax rate of return?

# 14.5 Default Risk and Bond Pricing

Although bonds generally promise a fixed flow of income, that income stream is not guaranteed unless the investor can be sure the issuer will not default on the obligation. While U.S. government bonds are effectively free of default risk, corporate bonds are not. The payments on these bonds are uncertain, for they depend to some degree on the ultimate financial status of the firm.

Bond default risk, usually called credit risk, is measured by rating agencies such as Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's Corporation, and Fitch Ratings, all of which provide financial information on firms as well as quality ratings of large corporate and municipal bond issues. International sovereign bonds, especially in emerging markets, also are commonly rated for default risk. Each rating firm assigns letter grades to the bonds of corporations and municipalities to reflect their assessment of the safety of the bond issue. The top rating is AAA or Aaa, a designation awarded to very few firms. Moody's modifies each rating class with a 1, 2, or 3 suffix (e.g., Aaa1, Aaa2, Aaa3) to provide a finer gradation of ratings. The other agencies use a + or - modification.

Bonds rated BBB or above (S&P, Fitch) or Baa and above (Moody's) are considered investment-grade bonds, whereas lower-rated bonds are classified as speculative-grade or junk bonds. Defaults on low-grade issues are not uncommon. For example, almost half of the bonds rated CCC by Standard & Poor's at issue have defaulted within 10 years. Highly rated bonds rarely default, but even these bonds are not free of credit risk. For example, in 2001 WorldCom sold \$11.8 billion of bonds with an investment-grade rating. Only a year later, the firm filed for bankruptcy and its bondholders lost more than  $80\%$  of their investment. Certain regulated institutional investors such as insurance companies have not always been allowed to invest in speculative-grade bonds.

Figure 14.8 provides the definitions of each bond rating classification.

# Junk Bonds

Junk bonds, also known as high-yield bonds, are nothing more than speculative-grade (low-rated or unrated) bonds. Before 1977, almost all junk bonds were "fallen angels," that is, bonds issued by firms that originally had investment-grade ratings but that had since been downgraded. In 1977, however, firms began to issue "original-issue junk."

Much of the credit for this innovation is given to Drexel Burnham Lambert, and especially its trader Michael Milken. Drexel had long enjoyed a niche as a junk bond trader and had established a network of potential investors in junk bonds. Firms not able to muster an investment-grade rating were happy to have Drexel (and other investment bankers) market their bonds directly to the public, as this opened up a new source of financing. Junk issues were a lower-cost financing alternative than borrowing from banks.

High-yield bonds gained considerable notoriety in the 1980s when they were used as financing vehicles in leveraged buyouts and hostile takeover attempts. Shortly thereafter, however, the junk bond market suffered. The legal difficulties of Drexel and Michael Milken in connection with Wall Street's insider trading scandals of the late 1980s tainted the junk bond market.

At the height of Drexel's difficulties, the high-yield bond market nearly dried up. While the market ultimately rebounded, the average credit quality of newly issued high-yield debt issued today is higher than the average quality in the boom years of the 1980s. Of course, junk bonds are still more vulnerable to economic distress than investment-grade bonds. During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, prices on these bonds fell dramatically, and their

# Determinants of Bond Safety

Bond rating agencies base their quality ratings largely on an analysis of the level and trend of some of the issuer's financial ratios. The key ratios used to evaluate safety are

1. Coverage ratios—Ratios of company earnings to fixed costs. For example, the times-interest-earned ratio is the ratio of earnings before interest payments and taxes to interest obligations. The fixed-charge coverage ratio includes lease payments and sinking fund payments with interest obligations to arrive at the ratio of earnings to all fixed cash obligations (sinking funds are described below). Low or falling coverage ratios signal possible cash flow difficulties.
2. Leverage (e.g., debt-to-equity) ratios—A too-high leverage ratio indicates excessive indebtedness, raising the concern the firm will be unable to earn enough to satisfy the obligations on its bonds.
3. Liquidity ratios—The two most common liquidity ratios are the current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) and the quick ratio (current assets excluding inventories/current liabilities). Liquidity ratios measure the firm's ability to pay bills coming due with its most liquid assets.
4. Profitability ratios—These ratios measure a firm's overall financial performance. The return on assets (earnings before interest and taxes divided by total assets) or return on equity (net income/equity) are the most popular of these measures. Firms with higher returns on assets or equity should be better able to raise money in security markets because they offer prospects for better returns on the firm's investments.
5. Cash flow-to-debt ratio—This is the ratio of total cash flow to outstanding debt.

Moody's periodically computes median values of selected ratios for firms in several rating classes, which we present in Table 14.3. Of course, ratios must be evaluated in the context of industry standards, and analysts differ in the weights they place on particular ratios. Nevertheless, Table 14.3 demonstrates the tendency of ratios to improve along with the firm's rating class.

Many studies have tested whether financial ratios can in fact be used to predict default risk. One of the best-known series of tests was conducted by Edward Altman, who used

<table><tr><td></td><td>Aaa</td><td>Aa</td><td>A</td><td>Baa</td><td>Ba</td><td>B</td><td>C</td></tr><tr><td>EBITA/Assets</td><td>12.3\%</td><td>10.5\%</td><td>11.2\%</td><td>9.0\%</td><td>8.8\%</td><td>6.6\%</td><td>4.9\%</td></tr><tr><td>Operating profit margin</td><td>24.8\%</td><td>18.9\%</td><td>14.3\%</td><td>12.9\%</td><td>11.9\%</td><td>9.6\%</td><td>4.6\%</td></tr><tr><td>EBITA to interest coverage (multiple)</td><td>12.0</td><td>19.0</td><td>12.2</td><td>6.5</td><td>3.9</td><td>2.0</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td>Debt/EBITDA (multiple)</td><td>1.9</td><td>1.8</td><td>2.1</td><td>2.8</td><td>3.6</td><td>5.1</td><td>6.9</td></tr><tr><td>Debt/(Debt + Equity)</td><td>42.8\%</td><td>36.6\%</td><td>39.6\%</td><td>45.4\%</td><td>55.7\%</td><td>65.9\%</td><td>79.8\%</td></tr><tr><td>Funds from operations/Total debt</td><td>40.4\%</td><td>44.5\%</td><td>37.7\%</td><td>28.2\%</td><td>21.3\%</td><td>12.5\%</td><td>5.7\%</td></tr><tr><td>Retained Cash Flow / Net Debt</td><td>32.3\%</td><td>29.5\%</td><td>31.2\%</td><td>26.6\%</td><td>21.3\%</td><td>13.0\%</td><td>6.0\%</td></tr></table>

Figure 14.9 Discriminant analysis


To illustrate the technique, suppose that we collect data on the return on equity (ROE) and coverage ratios of a sample of firms, and then keep records of any corporate bankruptcies. In Figure 14.9 we plot the ROE and coverage ratios for each firm, using  $X$  for firms that eventually went bankrupt and  $O$  for those that remained solvent. Clearly, the  $X$  and  $O$  firms show different patterns of data, with the solvent firms typically showing higher values for the two ratios.

The discriminant analysis determines the equation of the line that best separates the  $X$  and  $O$  obser vations. Suppose that the equation of the line is  $.75 = .9 \times \mathrm{ROE} + .4 \times \mathrm{Coverage}$ . Then, based on its own financial ratios, each firm is assigned a "Z-score" equal to  $.9 \times \mathrm{ROE} + .4 \times \mathrm{Coverage}$ . If its Z-score exceeds .75, the firm plots above the line and is considered a safe bet; Z-scores below .75 foretell financial difficulty.


Altman found the following equation to best separate failing and nonfailing firms:

$$
\begin{array}{l} Z = 3. 1 \frac {\text {E B I T}}{\text {T o t a l a s s e t s}} + 1. 0 \frac {\text {S a l e s}}{\text {A s s e t s}} + . 4 2 \frac {\text {S h a r e h o l d s} ^ {\prime} \text {e q u i t y}}{\text {T o t a l l i a b i l i t i e s}} \\ + . 8 5 \frac {\text {R e t a i n e d e a r n i n g s}}{\text {T o t a l a s s e t s}} + . 7 2 \frac {\text {W o r k i n g c a p i t a l}}{\text {T o t a l a s s e t s}} \\ \end{array}
$$ where  $\mathrm{EBIT} =$  earnings before interest and taxes. $^{11}$  Z-scores below 1.23 indicate vulnerability to bankruptcy, scores between 1.23 and 2.90 are a gray area, and scores above 2.90 are considered safe.

# Concept Check 14.8

Suppose we add a new variable equal to current liabilities/current assets to Altman's equation. Would you expect this variable to receive a positive or negative coefficient?

# Bond Indentures

A bond is issued with an indenture, which is the contract between the issuer and the bondholder. Part of the indenture is a set of restrictions that protect the rights of the bondholders. Such restrictions include provisions relating to collateral, sinking funds, dividend policy, and further borrowing. The issuing firm agrees to these protective covenants in order to market its bonds to investors concerned about the safety of the bond issue.


Sinking Funds Bonds call for the payment of par value at the end of the bond's life. This payment constitutes a large cash commitment for the issuer. To help ensure the commitment does not create a cash flow crisis, the firm agrees to establish a sinking fund to spread the payment burden over several years. The fund may operate in one of two ways:

1. The firm may repurchase a fraction of the outstanding bonds in the open market each year.
2. The firm may purchase a fraction of the outstanding bonds at a special call price associated with the sinking fund provision. The firm has an option to purchase the bonds at either the market price or the sinking fund price, whichever is lower. To allocate the burden of the sinking fund call fairly among bondholders, the bonds chosen for the call are selected at random based on serial number.[12]

The sinking fund call differs from a conventional bond call in two important ways. First, the firm can repurchase only a limited fraction of the bond issue at the sinking fund call price. At most, some indentures allow firms to use a doubling option, which allows repurchase of double the required number of bonds at the sinking fund call price. Second, while callable bonds generally have call prices above par value, the sinking fund call price usually is set at the bond's par value.

Although sinking funds ostensibly protect bondholders by making principal repayment more likely, they can hurt the investor. The firm will choose to buy back discount bonds (selling below par) at market price, while exercising its option to buy back premium bonds at par. Therefore, if interest rates fall and bond prices rise, firms will benefit from the sinking fund provision that enables them to repurchase their bonds at below-market prices. In these circumstances, the firm's gain is the bondholder's loss.

One bond issue that does not require a sinking fund is a serial bond issue, in which the firm sells bonds with staggered maturity dates. As bonds mature sequentially, the principal repayment burden is spread over time, just as it is with a sinking fund. Unlike sinking fund bonds, serial bonds do not confront security holders with the risk that a particular bond will be called for the sinking fund. The disadvantage, however, is that bonds of different maturity dates are not interchangeable, which reduces the liquidity of the issue.

Subordination of Further Debt One of the factors determining bond safety is total outstanding debt of the issuer. If you bought a bond today, you would be understandably distressed to see the firm tripling its outstanding debt tomorrow. The bond would be riskier than it appeared when you bought it. To prevent firms from harming bondholders in this manner, subordination clauses restrict the amount of additional borrowing. Additional debt might be required to be subordinated in priority to existing debt; that is, in the event of bankruptcy, subordinated or junior debtholders will not be paid unless and until the senior debt is fully paid off.

Dividend Restrictions Covenants limiting dividends protect bondholders because they force the firm to retain assets rather than paying them out to stockholders. A typical restriction disallows payments of dividends if cumulative dividends paid since the firm's inception exceed cumulative retained earnings plus proceeds from sales of stock.

Collateral Some bonds are issued with specific collateral behind them. Collateral is a particular asset that the bondholders receive if the firm defaults on the bond. If the collateral is property, the bond is called a mortgage bond. If the collateral takes the form of other securities held by the firm, the bond is a collateral trust bond. In the case of equipment, the bond is known as an equipment obligation bond. This last form of collateral is used most commonly by firms such as railroads, where the equipment is fairly standard and can be easily sold to another firm should the firm default.

Collateralized bonds generally are considered safer than general debenture bonds, which are unsecured, meaning they do not provide for specific collateral. Credit risk of unsecured bonds depends on the general earning power of the firm. If the firm defaults, debenture owners become general creditors of the firm. Because they are safer, collateralized bonds can be issued at lower yields than general debentures.

# Yield to Maturity and Default Risk

Because corporate bonds are subject to default risk, we must distinguish between the bond's promised yield to maturity and its expected yield. The promised or stated yield will be realized only if the firm meets the obligations of the bond issue. Therefore, the stated yield is the maximum possible yield to maturity of the bond. The expected yield to maturity must take into account the possibility of a default.

To compensate for default risk, corporate bonds must offer a default premium. The default premium, also called a credit spread, is the difference between the promised yield on a corporate bond and the yield of an otherwise-identical government bond that is riskless in terms of default. If the firm remains solvent and actually pays the investor all of the promised cash flows, the investor will realize a higher return than would be realized from the government bond. If, however, the firm goes bankrupt, the corporate bond is likely to provide a lower return than the government bond. The corporate bond has the potential for both better and worse performance than the default-free Treasury bond. In other words, it is riskier.

# Example 14.13 Expected versus Promised Yield to Maturity

Suppose a firm issued a  $9 \%$ coupon bond 20 years ago. The bond now has 10 years left until it matures, but the firm is having financial difficulties. Investors believe that the firm will be able to make good on the remaining interest payments, but at the maturity date, it will be forced into bankruptcy, and bondholders will receive only  $70 \%$ of par value. The bond is selling at 750. Yield to maturity (YTM) would then be calculated using the following inputs:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Expected YTM</td><td>Stated YTM</td></tr><tr><td>Coupon payment</td><td>$45</td><td>$45</td></tr><tr><td>Number of semiannual periods</td><td>20 periods</td><td>20 periods</td></tr><tr><td>Final payment</td><td>$700</td><td>$1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>$750</td><td>$750</td></tr></table>

The stated yield to maturity, which is based on promised payments, is  $13.7\%$ . Based on the expected payment of \$700 at maturity, however, the yield to maturity is only  $11.6\%$ . The stated yield to maturity is greater than the yield investors actually expect to earn.

For example, at the height of the financial crisis in October 2008, as Ford Motor Company struggled, its bonds due in 2028 were rated CCC and were selling at about  $33\%$  of par value, resulting in a yield to maturity of about  $20\%$ . Investors did not really believe the expected rate of return on these bonds was  $20\%$ . They recognized that there was a decent chance that bondholders would not receive all the payments promised in the bond contract and that the yield based on expected cash flows was far less than the yield based on promised cash flows. As it turned out, of course, Ford weathered the storm, and investors who purchased its bonds made a very nice profit: 10 years later, the bonds were selling for about  $108\%$  of par value, more than triple their value in 2008.

When a bond becomes more subject to default risk, its price will fall, and therefore its promised yield to maturity will rise. Therefore, its default premium will rise. However, its expected yield to maturity will be far less affected. Let's continue Example 14.13.

# Example 14.14 Default Risk and the Default Premium

Suppose that the condition of the firm in Example 14.13 deteriorates further, and investors now believe that the bond will pay off only  $55\%$  of face value at maturity. Because of the higher risk, investors now demand an expected yield to maturity of  $12\%$  (i.e.,  $6\%$  semiannually), which is  $4\%$  higher than in Example 14.13. But the price of the bond will fall from  $750 to$ 688  $[n = 20; i = 6; \mathrm{FV} = 550; \mathrm{PMT} = \$45]$ . At this price, the stated yield to maturity based on promised cash flows is  $15.2\%$ . While the expected yield to maturity has increased by  $4\%$ , the drop in price has caused the promised yield to maturity to rise by  $1.5\%$ .

The pattern of default premiums offered on risky bonds is sometimes called the risk structure of interest rates. The greater the default risk, the higher the default premium. Figure 14.11 shows spreads between yields to maturity of bonds of different risk classes. You can see here clear evidence of credit-risk premiums on promised yields. Note, for example, the incredible run-up of credit spreads during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.

# Credit Default Swaps

A credit default swap (CDS) is, in effect, an insurance policy on the default risk of a bond or loan. To illustrate, the annual premium in early 2010 on a 5-year Greek sovereign CDS was about  $3\%$ , meaning that the CDS buyer would pay the seller an annual "insurance premium" of \$3 for each \$100 of bond principal. The CDS seller collects these annual payments for the term of the contract but must compensate the buyer for loss of bond value in the event of a default.[13]

As originally envisioned, credit default swaps were designed to allow lenders to buy protection against default risk. The natural buyers of CDSs would then be large bondholders or banks that wished to enhance the creditworthiness of their loan portfolio. Even if the borrower had a shaky credit standing, the "insured" debt would be as safe as the issuer of the CDS. An investor holding a bond with a BB rating could, in principle, raise the effective quality of the debt to AAA by buying a CDS on the issuer.

This insight suggests how CDS contracts should be priced. If a BB-rated corporate bond bundled with insurance via a CDS is effectively equivalent to an AAA-rated bond, then the premium on the swap ought to approximate the yield spread between AAA-rated and BB-rated bonds. $^{14}$  The risk structure of interest rates and CDS prices ought to be tightly aligned.


Figure 14.12 shows the prices of 5-year CDS contracts on Greek government debt between 2009 and 2010 as well as the spread between yields on Greek and German government bonds. As the strongest economy in the euro zone, German bonds are the natural candidate to play the role of the "risk-free benchmark." As expected, the credit spread and CDS prices move almost in lockstep.

You can see that both the credit spread and the CDS price started to increase dramatically toward the end of 2009. As perceptions of Greece's credit risk increased, so did the price of insuring its debt. Ultimately, in what amounted to the largest ever sovereign default, lenders agreed in 2012 to reduce Greece's debt by around 130 billion.

CDS contracts trade on corporate as well as sovereign debt. While CDSs were conceived as a form of bond insurance, it wasn't long before investors realized that they could be used to speculate on the financial health of particular issuers. For example, an investor in early 2008 who predicted the imminent financial crisis might have purchased CDS contracts on mortgage bonds as well as the debt of financial firms and would have profited as their CDS prices spiked in September. In fact, hedge fund manager John Paulson famously did just this. His bearish bets in 2007-2008 on commercial banks and Wall Street firms as well as on some riskier mortgage-backed securities made his funds more than \$15 billion, bringing him a personal payoff of more than \$3.7 billion.

We say "approximate" because there are some differences between highly rated bonds and bonds synthetically enhanced with credit default swaps. For example, the term of the swap may not match the maturity of the bond. Tax treatment of coupon payments versus swap payments may differ, as may the liquidity of the bonds. Finally, some CDSs may entail one-time up-front payments in addition to annual premiums.

# Credit Default Swaps, Systemic Risk, and the Financial Crisis of 2008-2009

The credit crisis of 2008-2009, when lending among banks and other financial institutions effectively seized up, was in large measure a crisis of transparency. The biggest problem was a widespread lack of confidence in the financial standing of counterparties to a trade. If one institution could not be confident that another would remain solvent, it would understandably be reluctant to offer it a loan. When doubt about the credit exposure of customers and trading partners spiked to levels not seen since the Great Depression, the market for loans dried up.

Credit default swaps in particular were cited for fostering doubts about counterparty reliability. By August 2008,  \$63 trillion of such swaps were reportedly outstanding. (By comparison, U.S. gross domestic product in 2008 was about\$ 14 trillion.) As the subprime mortgage market collapsed and the economy entered a deep recession, the potential obligations on these contracts ballooned to levels previously considered unimaginable and the ability of CDS sellers to honor their commitments appeared in doubt. For example, the huge insurance firm AIG alone had sold more than 400 billion of CDS contracts on subprime mortgages and other loans and was days from insolvency. But AIG's insolvency could have triggered the insolvency of other firms that had relied on its promise of protection against loan defaults. These in turn might have triggered further defaults. In the end, the government felt compelled to rescue AIG to prevent a chain reaction of insolvencies.


Counterparty risk and lax reporting requirements made it effectively impossible to tease out firms' exposures to credit risk. One problem was that CDS positions did not have to be accounted for on balance sheets. And the possibility of one default setting off a sequence of further defaults meant that lenders were exposed to the default of an institution with which they did not even directly trade. Such knock-on effects create systemic risk, in which the entire financial system can freeze up. With the ripple effects of bad debt extending in ever-widening circles, lending to anyone can seem imprudent.

In the aftermath of the credit crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act called for new regulation and reforms. One reform is a central clearinghouse for credit derivatives such as CDS contracts. Such a system fosters transparency of positions and allows the clearinghouse to replace traders' offsetting long and short positions with a single net position. It also requires daily recognition of gains or losses on positions through a margin or collateral account. If losses mount, positions have to be unwound before growing to unsustainable levels. Allowing traders to accurately assess counterparty risk, and limiting such risk through margin accounts and the extra back-up of the clearinghouse, can go a long way in limiting systemic risk.

# Credit Risk and Collateralized Debt Obligations

Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) emerged in the last decade as a major mechanism to reallocate credit risk in the fixed-income markets. To create a CDO, a financial institution, commonly a bank, first would establish a legally distinct entity to buy and later resell a portfolio of bonds or other loans. A common vehicle for this purpose was the so-called Structured Investment Vehicle (SIV). An SIV raises funds, often by issuing short-term commercial paper, and uses the proceeds to buy corporate bonds or other forms of debt such as mortgage loans or credit card debt. These loans are first pooled together and then split into a series of classes known as tranches. (Tranche is the French word for "slice.")

Each tranche is given a different level of seniority in terms of its claims on the underlying loan pool, and each can be sold as a stand-alone security. As the loans in the underlying pool make their interest payments, the proceeds are distributed to pay interest to each tranche in order of seniority. This priority structure implies that each tranche has a different exposure to credit risk.

Figure 14.13 illustrates a typical setup. The senior tranche is on top. Its investors may account for perhaps  $80\%$  of the principal of the entire pool. But it has first claim on all the debt service. Using our numbers, even if  $20\%$  of the debt pool defaults, enough principal is repaid to fully pay off the senior tranche. Once the highest seniority tranche is paid off, the next-lower class (e.g., the mezzanine 1 tranche in Figure 14.13) receives the proceeds

<table><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Senior-Subordinated
Tranche Structure</td><td>Typical Terms</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Senior tranche</td><td>70–90\% of notional principal, coupon similar to
Aa-Aaa rated bonds</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Mezzanine 1</td><td>5–15\% of principal, investment-grade rating</td></tr><tr><td>Bank</td><td>Structured
investment vehicle, SIV</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Mezzanine 2</td><td>5–15\% of principal, higher-
quality junk rating</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Equity/first loss/ residual tranche</td><td>&lt;2\%, unrated, coupon rate
with 20\% credit spread</td></tr></table> from the pool of loans until its claims also are satisfied. Using junior tranches to insulate senior tranches from credit risk in this manner, one can create Aaa-rated bonds even from a junk-bond portfolio.

Figure 14.13 Collateralized debt obligations


Of course, shielding senior tranches from default risk means that the risk is concentrated on the lower tranches. The bottom tranche—called alternatively the equity, first-loss, or residual tranche—has last call on payments from the pool of loans, or, put differently, is at the head of the line in terms of absorbing default or delinquency risk.

Not surprisingly, investors in tranches with the greatest exposure to credit risk demand the highest coupon rates. Therefore, while the lower mezzanine and equity tranches bear the most risk, they will provide the highest returns if credit experience turns out favorably.

Mortgage-backed CDOs were an investment disaster in 2007-2009. These were CDOs formed by pooling subprime mortgage loans made to individuals whose credit standing did not allow them to qualify for conventional mortgages. When home prices stalled in 2007 and interest rates on these typically adjustable-rate loans reset to market levels, mortgage delinquencies and home foreclosures soared, and investors in these securities lost billions of dollars. Even investors in highly rated tranches experienced large losses.

Not surprisingly, the rating agencies that had certified these tranches as investment-grade came under considerable fire. Questions were raised concerning conflicts of interest: Because the rating agencies are paid by bond issuers, the agencies were accused of responding to pressure to ease their standards.

While CDO issuance fell dramatically in the wake of the financial crisis, they have more recently enjoyed a comeback. However, newer CDOs generally appear to be safer than their pre-crisis cousins. The Dodd-Frank Act requires CDO issuers to retain a material portion of the credit risk of the underlying portfolio. This requirement provides an incentive for issuers to limit credit risk rather than simply off-load it onto another investor. Moreover, banks under the Basel III accord are obligated to hold more capital against the risk of losses. Finally, CDOs today are less likely to hold subprime residential mortgages and more likely to hold higher-rated securities with less leverage.

# SUMMARY

1. Fixed-income securities are distinguished by their promise to pay a fixed or specified stream of income to their holders. The coupon bond is a typical fixed-income security.
2. Treasury notes and bonds have original maturities greater than one year. They are issued at or near par value, with their prices quoted net of accrued interest.
3. Callable bonds should offer higher promised yields to maturity to compensate investors for the fact that they will not realize full capital gains should the interest rate fall and the bonds be called away from them at the stipulated call price. Bonds often are issued with a period of call protection. In addition, discount bonds selling significantly below their call price offer implicit call protection.
4. Put bonds give the bondholder rather than the issuer the option to terminate or extend the life of the bond.
5. Convertible bonds may be exchanged, at the bondholder's discretion, for a specified number of shares of stock. Convertible bondholders "pay" for this option by accepting a lower coupon rate on the security.
6. Floating-rate bonds pay a coupon rate at a fixed premium over a reference short-term interest rate. Risk is limited because the rate is tied to current market conditions.
7. The yield to maturity is the single interest rate that equates the present value of a security's cash flows to its price. Bond values and yields are inversely related. For premium bonds, the coupon rate is greater than the current yield, which is greater than the yield to maturity. The order of these inequalities is reversed for discount bonds.
8. The yield to maturity is often interpreted as an estimate of the average rate of return to an investor who purchases a bond and holds it until maturity. However, when future rates are uncertain, actual returns including reinvested coupons may diverge from yield to maturity. Related measures are yield to call, realized compound yield, and expected (versus promised) yield to maturity.
9. Prices of zero-coupon bonds rise exponentially over time, providing a rate of appreciation equal to the interest rate. The IRS treats this built-in price appreciation as imputed taxable interest income to the investor.
10. When bonds are subject to potential default, the stated yield to maturity is the maximum possible yield to maturity that can be realized by the bondholder. In the event of default, however, that promised yield will not be realized. To compensate bond investors for default risk, bonds must offer default premiums, that is, promised yields in excess of those offered by default-free government securities.
11. Bond safety is often measured using financial ratio analysis. Bond indentures are safeguards to protect the claims of bondholders. Common indentures specify sinking fund requirements, collateralization of the loan, dividend restrictions, and subordination of future debt.
12. Credit default swaps provide insurance against the default of a bond or loan. The swap buyer pays an annual premium to the swap seller but collects a payment equal to lost value if the loan later goes into default.
13. Collateralized debt obligations are used to reallocate the credit risk of a pool of loans. The pool is sliced into tranches, with each tranche assigned a different level of seniority in terms of its claims on the cash flows from the underlying loans. High seniority tranches are usually quite safe, with credit risk concentrated on the lower-level tranches. Each tranche can be sold as a stand-alone security.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. The callable bond will sell at the lower price. Investors will not be willing to pay as much if they know that the firm retains a valuable option to reclaim the bond for the call price if interest rates fall.
 2. At a semiannual interest rate of 3\%, the bond is worth \$40 × Annuity factor(3\%, 60) + \$1,000 × PV factor(3\%, 60) = \$1,276.76, which results in a capital gain of \$276.76. This exceeds the capital loss of $189.29 (i.e., $1,000 - 810.71) when the semiannual interest rate increased from 4\% to 5\%.
3. Yield to maturity exceeds current yield, which exceeds coupon rate. Take as an example the  $8\%$  coupon bond with a yield to maturity of  $10\%$  per year ( $5\%$  per half-year). Its price is  $\$ 810.71$ , and therefore its current yield is  $80 / 810.71 = .0987$ , or  $9.87\%$ , which is higher than the coupon rate but lower than the yield to maturity.
 4. a. The bond with the 6\% coupon rate currently sells for 30 × Annuity factor(3.5\%, 20) + 1,000 × PV factor(3.5\%, 20) = \$928.94. If the interest rate immediately drops to 6\% (3\% per half-year), the bond price will rise to \$1,000, for a capital gain of \$71.06, or 7.65\%. The 8\% coupon bond currently sells for \$1,071.06. If the interest rate falls to 6\%, the present value of the scheduled payments increases to \$1,148.77. However, the bond will be called at \$1,100, for a capital gain of only 28.94, or 2.70\%.
b. The current price of the bond can be derived from its yield to maturity. Using your calculator, set  n = 40  (semiannual periods); payment  = \ {45}  per period; future value  = \ 1,{000}  ; interest rate  = 4\%  per semiannual period. Calculate present value as  \$ 1,{098.96}  . Now we can calculate yield to call. The time to call is 5 years, or 10 semiannual periods. The price at which the bond will be called is  \$ 1,{050}  . To find yield to call,we set  n = {10}  (semiannual periods); payment  = \ {45}  per period; future value  = \$ 1,{050}  ; present value  = \ 1,{098.96}  . Calculate yield to call as  {3.72}\%  ,or  {7.44}\%  bond equivalent yield.
5. Price = \$70 × Annuity factor(8\%, 1) + \$1,000 × PV factor(8\%, 1) = 990.74

$$
\text{Rate of return to investor} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 70 + (\mathbb {S} 990.74 - \mathbb {S} 982.17)}{\mathbb {S} 982.17} = . 080 = 8 \%
$$

6. By year-end, remaining maturity is 29 years. If the yield to maturity were still 8\%, the bond would still sell at par and the holding-period return would be 8\%. At a higher yield, price and return will be lower. Suppose, for example, that the yield to maturity rises to 8.5\%. With annual payments of \$80 and a face value of \$1,000, the price of the bond will be $946.70 [n = 29; i = 8.5\%; PMT = $80; FV = \$1,000]. The bond initially sold at \$1,000 when issued at the start of the year. The holding-period return is

$$
\mathrm{HPR} = \frac{80 + (946.70 - 1,000)}{1,000} = .0267 = 2.67\%
$$ which is less than the initial yield to maturity of  $8\%$ .


7. At the lower yield, the bond price will be $631.67 [n = 29, i = 7\%, FV = $1,000, PMT = 40]. Therefore, total after-tax income is

<table><tr><td>Coupon</td><td>$40 × (1 - .38)</td><td>= $24.80</td></tr><tr><td>Imputed interest</td><td>($553.66 - $549.69) × (1 - .38)</td><td>= 2.46</td></tr><tr><td>Capital gains</td><td>($631.67 - $553.66) × (1 - .20)</td><td>= 62.41</td></tr><tr><td>Total income after taxes</td><td></td><td>89.67</td></tr></table>

Rate of return  $= {89.67}/{549.69} = {.163} = {16.3}\%$  .

8. It should receive a negative coefficient. A high ratio of liabilities to assets is a bad omen for a firm, and that should lower its credit rating.
 9. The coupon payment is \$45. There are 20 semiannual periods. The final payment is assumed to be \$500. The present value of expected cash flows is 650. The expected yield to maturity is 6.317\% semiannual or annualized, 12.63\%, bond equivalent yield.

# The Term Structure of Interest Rates

# 15

IN CHAPTER 14 we assumed for the sake of simplicity that the same interest rate is appropriate to discount cash flows of any maturity. In reality, however, this is rarely the case. For example, Figure 14.1 showed that in mid-2021, short-term Treasury bonds and notes carried yields to maturity around  $.4\%$ , while the longest-term bonds offered yields of about  $1.9\%$ . At the time that these bond prices were quoted, anyway, the longer-term securities had higher yields. This, in fact, is a typical pattern, but as we shall see below, the relationship between time to maturity and yield to maturity can vary dramatically from one period to another. In this chapter, we explore the pattern of interest rates for different-term assets. We attempt to identify the factors that account for that pattern and determine what information may be gleaned from an analysis of the so-called term structure of interest rates, the structure of interest rates for discounting cash flows of different maturities.


We demonstrate how the prices of Treasury bonds may be derived from prices and yields of stripped zero-coupon Treasury securities. We also examine the extent to which the term structure reveals market-consensus forecasts of future interest rates and how the presence of interest rate risk may affect those inferences. Finally, we show how traders can use the term structure to compute forward rates that represent interest rates on "forward," or deferred, loans, and consider the relationship between forward rates and future interest rates.

# 15.1 The Yield Curve

In the last chapter, Figure 14.1 demonstrated that while yields to maturity on bonds of similar maturities are reasonably close, they do differ. When these bond prices and yields were compiled, long-term bonds sold at higher yields than short-term bonds. Practitioners commonly summarize the relationship between yield and maturity graphically in a yield curve, which is a plot of yield to maturity as a function of time to maturity. The yield curve is one of the key concerns of fixed-income investors. It is central to bond valuation and, in addition, allows investors to gauge their expectations for future interest rates against those of the market. Such a comparison is often the starting point in the formulation of a fixed-income portfolio strategy.

In 2021, the yield curve was rising, with long-term bonds offering yields higher than those of short-term bonds. But the relationship between yield and maturity can vary widely. Figure 15.1 illustrates yield curves of several different shapes. Panel A is the almost-flat curve of early 2006. Panel B is a more typical upward-sloping curve from 2012. Panel C is a downward-sloping or "inverted" curve, and Panel D is hump-shaped, first rising and then falling.

# Bond Pricing

If yields on different-maturity bonds are not all equal, how should we value coupon bonds that make payments at many different times? For example, suppose that yields on zero-coupon Treasury bonds of different maturities are as given in Table 15.1. Zero-coupon bonds with 1-year maturity sell at a yield to maturity of  $y_{1} = 5\%$ , 2-year zeros sell at yields of  $y_{2} = 6\%$ , and 3-year zeros sell at yields of  $y_{3} = 7\%$ . Which of these rates should we use to discount bond cash flows? The answer: all of them. The trick is to consider each bond cash flow—either coupon or principal payment—as at least potentially sold off separately as a stand-alone zero-coupon bond.

Recall the Treasury STRIPS program we introduced in the last chapter (Section 14.4). Stripped Treasuries are zero-coupon bonds created by selling each coupon or principal

Table 15.1

<table><tr><td>Prices and yields to maturity on zero-coupon bonds (1,000 face value)</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>Maturity (years)</td><td>Yield to Maturity (\%)</td><td>Price</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>5\%</td><td>$952.38 = $1,000/1.05</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>$890.00 = $1,000/1.062</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>$816.30 = $1,000/1.073</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>$735.03 = $1,000/1.084</td></tr></table> payment from a whole Treasury bond as a separate cash flow. For example, a 1-year-maturity T-bond paying semiannual coupons can be split into a 6-month maturity zero (by selling the first coupon payment as a stand-alone security) and a 12-month zero (corresponding to payment of final coupon and principal). Treasury stripping suggests exactly how to value a coupon bond. If each cash flow can be (and in practice often is) sold off as a separate security, then the value of the whole bond should equal the total value of its cash flows bought piece by piece in the STRIPS market.


What if it weren't? Then there would be easy profits to be made. For example, if investment bankers ever noticed a bond selling for less than the amount at which the sum of its parts could be sold, they would buy the bond, strip it into stand-alone zero-coupon securities, sell off the stripped cash flows, and profit by the price difference. If the bond were selling for more than the sum of the values of its individual cash flows, they would run the process in reverse: buy the individual zero-coupon securities in the STRIPS market, reconstitute (i.e., reassemble) the cash flows into a coupon bond, and sell the whole bond for more than the cost of the pieces. Both bond stripping and bond reconstitution offer opportunities for arbitrage—the exploitation of mispricing among two or more securities to clear a riskless economic profit. Any violation of the Law of One Price, that identical cash flow bundles must sell for identical prices, gives rise to arbitrage opportunities.

To value each cash flow, we simply look up its appropriate discount rate in the stripped Treasury market. Because each coupon payment matures at a different time, we discount by using the yield appropriate to its particular maturity—this is the yield on a Treasury strip maturing at the time of that cash flow. We can illustrate with an example.

# Example 15.1 Valuing Coupon Bonds

Suppose the yields on stripped Treasuries are as given in Table 15.1, and we wish to value a  $10\%$  coupon bond with a maturity of three years. For simplicity, assume the bond makes its payments annually. Then the first cash flow, the  $\$ 100$ coupon paid at the end of the first year, is discounted at  $5\%$ ; the second cash flow, the  $\$ 100$ coupon at the end of the second year, is discounted for two years at  $6\%$ ; and the final cash flow consisting of the final coupon plus par value, or  $\$ 1,100$ , is discounted for three years at  $7\%$ . The value of the coupon bond is therefore

$$
\frac {1 0 0}{1 . 0 5} + \frac {1 0 0}{1 . 0 6 ^ {2}} + \frac {1 , 1 0 0}{1 . 0 7 ^ {3}} = 9 5. 2 3 8 + 8 9. 0 0 0 + 8 9 7. 9 2 8 = \$ 1, 0 8 2. 1 7
$$

Calculate the yield to maturity of the coupon bond in Example 15.1, and you may be surprised. It is  $6.88\%$ ; so while the bond's maturity matches that of the 3-year zero in Table 15.1, its yield is a bit lower. This reflects the fact that the 3-year coupon bond may usefully be thought of as a portfolio of three implicit zero-coupon bonds, one corresponding to each cash flow. The yield on the coupon bond therefore reflects the yields on each of the three components of the "portfolio." Think about what this means: If their coupon rates differ, bonds of the same maturity generally will not have the same yield to maturity.

What then do we mean by "the" yield curve? In fact, in practice, traders refer to several yield curves. The pure yield curve refers to the curve for stripped, or zero-coupon,

Treasuries. In contrast, the on-the-run yield curve refers to the plot of yield as a function of maturity for recently issued coupon bonds selling at or near par value. As we've just seen, these curves may differ significantly. The yield curves published in the financial press, like those, in Figure 15.1, are typically on-the-run curves. On-the-run Treasuries have the greatest liquidity, so traders have keen interest in their yield curve.

# Concept Check 15.1

Using the data in Table 15.1, calculate the price and yield to maturity of a 3-year bond with a coupon rate of  $4\%$  making annual coupon payments. Does its yield match that of either the 3-year zero or the  $10\%$  coupon bond considered in Example 15.1? Why is the yield spread between the  $4\%$  bond and the zero smaller than the yield spread between the  $10\%$  bond and the zero?

# 15.2 The Yield Curve and Future Interest Rates

We've told you what the yield curve is, but we haven't yet had much to say about where it comes from. For example, why is the curve sometimes upward-sloping and other times downward-sloping? How do expectations for the evolution of interest rates affect the shape of today's yield curve?

These questions do not have simple answers, so we will begin with an admittedly idealized framework, and then extend the discussion to more realistic settings. To start, consider a world with no uncertainty, specifically, one in which all investors already know the path of future interest rates.

# The Yield Curve under Certainty

If interest rates are certain, what should we make of the fact that the yield on the 2-year zero coupon bond in Table 15.1 is greater than that on the 1-year zero? It can't be that one bond is expected to provide a higher rate of return than the other. This would not be possible in a certain world—with no risk, all bonds (in fact, all securities!) must offer identical returns, or investors will bid up the price of the high-return bond until its rate of return is no longer superior to that of other bonds.

Instead, the upward-sloping yield curve is evidence that short-term rates are going to be higher next year than they are now. To see why, consider two 2-year bond strategies. The first strategy entails buying the 2-year zero offering a 2-year yield to maturity of  $y_{2} = 6\%$ , and holding it until maturity. The zero has face value  \$1,000, so it is purchased today for$ 1,000/1.06^2 = $890 and matures in two years to \$1,000. The total 2-year growth factor for the investment is therefore  $1,000 / $890 = 1.06^2 = 1.1236.$

Now consider an alternative 2-year strategy. Invest the same 890 in a 1-year zero-coupon bond with a yield to maturity of 5\%. When that bond matures, reinvest the proceeds in another 1-year bond. Figure 15.2 illustrates these two strategies. The interest rate that 1-year bonds will offer next year is denoted as r_2.

Remember, both strategies must provide equal returns—neither entails any risk. Therefore, the proceeds after two years to either strategy must be equal:

$$
\text {B u y a n d h o l d 2 - y e a r z e r o} = \text {R o l l o v e r 1 - y e a r b o n d s}
$$

$$
\$ 8 9 0 \times 1. 0 6 ^ {2} = \$ 8 9 0 \times 1. 0 5 \times (1 + r _ {2})
$$

We find next year's interest rate by solving  $1 + r_{2} = 1.06^{2} / 1.05 = 1.0701$ , or  $r_2 = 7.01\%$ . So while the 1-year bond offers a lower yield to maturity than the 2-year bond (5\% versus 6\%), we see that it has a compensating advantage: It allows you to roll over your funds into another short-term bond next year when rates will be higher. Next year's interest rate is higher than today's by just enough to make rolling over 1-year bonds equally attractive as investing in the 2-year bond.

Figure 15.2 Two 2-year investment programs


To distinguish between yields on long-term bonds versus short-term rates that will be available in the future, practitioners use the following terminology. They call the yield to maturity on zero-coupon bonds the spot rate, meaning the rate that prevails today for a time period corresponding to the zero's maturity. In contrast, the short rate for a given time interval (e.g., one year) refers to the interest rate for that interval available at different points in time. In our example, the short rate today is  $5\%$ , and the short rate next year will be  $7.01\%$ .

Not surprisingly, the 2-year spot rate is an average of today's and next year's short rates. But because of compounding, that average is a geometric one. We see this by again equating the total return on the two competing 2-year strategies:

$$
\begin{array}{l} (1 + y _ {2}) ^ {2} = (1 + r _ {1}) \times (1 + r _ {2}) \\ 1 + y _ {2} = \left[ \left(1 + r _ {1}\right) \times \left(1 + r _ {2}\right) \right] ^ {1 / 2} \\ \end{array}
$$

Equation 15.1 begins to tell us why the yield curve might take on different shapes at different times. When next year's short rate,  $r_2$ , is greater than this year's short rate,  $r_1$ , the average of the two rates is higher than today's rate, so  $y_2 > r_1$  and the yield curve slopes upward. If next year's short rate were less than  $r_1$ , the yield curve would slope downward.

Thus, at least in part, the yield curve reflects the market's assessments of coming interest rates. The following example uses a similar analysis to find the short rate that will prevail in year 3.

# Example 15.2 Finding a Future Short Rate

Now we compare two 3-year strategies. One is to buy a 3-year zero, with a yield to maturity from Table 15.1 of  $7\%$ , and hold it until maturity. The other is to buy a 2-year zero yielding  $6\%$  and roll the proceeds into a 1-year bond in year 3, at the short rate  $r_3$ . The growth factor for the invested funds under each policy will be:

Buy and hold 3-year zero = Buy 2-year zero; roll proceeds into 1-year bond

$$
(1 + y _ {3}) ^ {3} = (1 + y _ {2}) ^ {2} \times (1 + r _ {3})
$$

$$
1. 0 7 ^ {3} = 1. 0 6 ^ {2} \times (1 + r _ {3})
$$ which implies that  $r_3 = 1.07^3 / 1.06^2 - 1 = .09028 = 9.028\%$ . Again, notice that the yield on the 3-year bond reflects a geometric average of the discount factors for the next three years:


$$
1 + y _ {3} = \left[ (1 + r _ {1}) \times (1 + r _ {2}) \times (1 + r _ {3}) \right] ^ {1 / 3}
$$

$$
1. 0 7 = [ 1. 0 5 \times 1. 0 7 0 1 \times 1. 0 9 0 2 8 ] ^ {1 / 3}
$$

We conclude that the yield or spot rate on a long-term bond reflects the anticipated path of short rates over the life of the bond.

# Concept Check 15.2

Use Table 15.1 to find the short rate in the fourth year. Confirm that the discount factor on the 4-year zero is a geometric average of  $1 +$  the short rates in the next four years.

Figure 15.3 summarizes the results of our analysis and emphasizes the difference between short rates and spot rates. The top line presents the short rates for each year. The lower lines present spot rates—or, equivalently, yields to maturity on zero-coupon bonds for different holding periods—extending from the present to each relevant maturity date.

# Holding-Period Returns

We've argued that the multiyear cumulative returns on all of our competing bonds ought to be equal. What about holding-period returns over shorter periods such as a year? You might think that bonds selling at higher yields to maturity will offer higher 1-year returns, but this is not the case. In fact, once you stop to think about it, it's clear that this cannot be true. In a world of certainty, all bonds must offer identical returns, or investors will flock to the higher-return securities, bidding up their prices, and reducing their returns. We can illustrate by using the bonds in Table 15.1.

# Example 15.3 Holding-Period Returns on Zero-Coupon Bonds

The 1-year bond in Table 15.1 can be bought today for 1,000/1.05 = \952.38 and will mature to its par value in one year. It pays no coupons, so total investment income is just its price appreciation, and its rate of return is (\1,000 - \952.38)/\952.38 = .05 The 2-year bond can be bought for 1,000 / 1.06^2 = \890.00. Next year, the bond will have a remaining maturity of one year and the 1-year interest rate will be 7.01\%. Therefore, its price next year will be \$ 1,000 / 1.0701 = \934.49, and its 1-year holding-period rate of return will be (\934.49 - \890.00)/\890.00 = .05, for an identical 5\% rate of return.


![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/5f5fd231f222e3d81e9367e01c99276acdebfb5e4bbcbdf9bd85b5d399862647.jpg)

# Concept Check 15.3

Show that the rate of return on the 3-year zero in Table 15.1 also will be  $5\%$ . (Hint: Next year, the bond will have a maturity of two years.) Use the short rates derived in Figure 15.3 to compute the 2-year spot rate that will prevail a year from now.

# Forward Rates

We can generalize our approach to inferring a future short rate from the yield curve of zero-coupon bonds. The idea is to equate the total return on two  $n$ -year investment strategies: buying and holding an  $n$ -year zero-coupon bond versus buying an  $(n - 1)$ -year zero and rolling over the proceeds into a 1-year bond.

$$
(1 + y _ {n}) ^ {n} = (1 + y _ {n - 1}) ^ {n - 1} \times (1 + r _ {n}) \tag {15.2}
$$ where  $y_{n}$  is the yield to maturity of a zero-coupon bond with an  $n$ -period maturity. Given the observed yield curve, we can solve Equation 15.2 for the short rate in the last period:


$$
\left(1 + r _ {n}\right) = \frac {\left(1 + y _ {n}\right) ^ {n}}{\left(1 + y _ {n - 1}\right) ^ {n - 1}} \tag {15.3}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/10567874d139176c5a78743ac1a21074b7ada76053a87cd5e5437fc9e19f0df6.jpg)
Figure 15.3 Short rates versus spot rates

Equation 15.3 has a simple interpretation. The numerator on the right-hand side is the cumulative growth of an investment in an  $n$ -year zero held until maturity. Similarly, the denominator is the growth of an investment in an  $(n - 1)$ -year zero. Because the former investment lasts for one more year than the latter, the difference in these growth multiples must be the gross rate of return available in year  $n$  when the  $(n - 1)$ -year zero can be rolled over into a 1-year investment.

Of course, when future interest rates are uncertain, there is no meaning to inferring "the" future short rate. No one knows today what that rate will be. At best, we can speculate as to its expected value and associated uncertainty. Nevertheless, it still is common to use Equation 15.3 to investigate the implications of the yield curve for future interest rates. Recognizing that future interest rates are uncertain, we call the interest rate that we infer in this matter the forward interest rate rather than the future short rate.

If the forward rate for period  $n$  is denoted  $f_{n}$ , then

$$
\left(1 + f _ {n}\right) = \frac {\left(1 + y _ {n}\right) ^ {n}}{\left(1 + y _ {n - 1}\right) ^ {n - 1}} \tag {15.4}
$$

Equivalently, we may rewrite Equation 15.4 as

$$
(1 + y _ {n}) ^ {n} = (1 + y _ {n - 1}) ^ {n - 1} (1 + f _ {n}) \tag {15.5}
$$

We see that the forward rate is defined as the "break-even" interest rate that equates the return on an  $n$ -period zero-coupon bond to that of an  $(n - 1)$ -period zero-coupon bond rolled over into a 1-year bond in year  $n$ . The actual total returns on the two  $n$ -year strategies will be equal if the short interest rate in year  $n$  turns out to equal  $f_{n}$ .

# Example 15.4 Forward Rates

Consider the data in Table 15.1. The forward rate for year 4 is found from

$$
1 + f _ {4} = \frac {\left(1 + y _ {4}\right) ^ {4}}{\left(1 + y _ {3}\right) ^ {3}} = \frac {1 . 0 8 ^ {4}}{1 . 0 7 ^ {3}} = 1. 1 1 0 6
$$

Therefore, the forward rate is  $f_{4} = .1106$ , or  $11.06\%$ .

We emphasize again that the interest rate that actually will prevail in the future need not equal the forward rate, which is calculated from today's data. Indeed, the forward rate may not even equal the expected value of the future short interest rate. We address this issue in the next section. For now, however, we note that forward rates equal future short rates in the special case of interest rate certainty.

# Concept Check 15.4

You've been exposed to many "rates" in the last few pages. Explain the differences among spot rates, short rates, and forward rates.

The spreadsheet below (available in Connect or through your course instructor) can be used to estimate prices and yields of coupon bonds and to calculate the forward rates for both single-year and multiyear periods. Spot yields are derived for the yield curve of bonds that are selling at their par value, also referred to as the current coupon or "on-the-run" bond yield curve.

The spot rates for each maturity date are used to calculate the present value of each period's cash flow. The sum of these cash flows is the price of the bond. Given its price, the bond's yield to maturity can then be computed. If you were to err and use the yield to maturity of the on-the-run bond to discount each of the bond's coupon payments, you would find a significantly different price. That difference is calculated in the worksheet.


# Excel Questions

1. Change the spot rate in the spreadsheet to  $8\%$  for all maturities. The forward rates will all be  $8\%$ . Why is this not surprising?
2. The spot rates in column B decrease for longer maturities, and the forward rates decrease even more rapidly with maturity. What happens to the pattern of forward rates if you input spot rates that increase with maturity? Why?

# 15.3 Interest Rate Uncertainty and Forward Rates

The term structure is harder to interpret when future interest rates are uncertain. In a certain world, different investment strategies with common terminal dates must provide equal rates of return. For example, two consecutive 1-year investments would need to offer the same total return as an equal-sized investment in a 2-year zero. Therefore, under certainty,

$$
(1 + r _ {1}) (1 + r _ {2}) = (1 + y _ {2}) ^ {2} \tag {15.6}
$$

But what if  $r_2$  is not known today?

For example, suppose that today's rate is  $r_1 = 5\%$  and that the expected short rate for the following year is  $E(r_2) = 6\%$ . If investors cared only about the expected value of the interest rate, then the yield to maturity on a 2-year zero would be determined by using the expected short rate in Equation 15.6:

$$
(1 + y _ {2}) ^ {2} = (1 + r _ {1}) \times [ 1 + E (r _ {2}) ] = 1. 0 5 \times 1. 0 6
$$

The price of a 2-year zero would be  $\1,000 / (1 + y_2)^2 = \$ 1,000 / (1.05 \times 1.06) = \$898.47.

But consider short-term investors who wish to invest only for one year. They can purchase the 1-year zero for  $\ 1,000 / 1.05 = \$  952.38  and lock in a riskless  $5\%$  return because they know that at the end of the year, the bond will be worth its maturity value of  \$1,000. They also can purchase the 2-year zero. Its expected rate of return also is 5\%$ : Next year, the bond will have one year to maturity, and we expect that the 1-year interest rate will be  $6\%$ , implying a price of 943.40 and a holding-period return of  $5\%$ .


But the rate of return on the 2-year bond is risky. If next year's interest rate turns out to be above expectations, that is, greater than  $6\%$ , the bond price will be below  \$943.40; conversely if r_2\$  turns out to be less than  $6\%$ , the bond price will exceed 943.40. Why should these short-term investors buy the risky 2-year bond when its expected return is  $5\%$ , no better than that of the risk-free 1-year bond? If they demand a higher expected rate of return as compensation for that risk, the 2-year bond must sell at a lower price than the 898.47 value we derived when we ignored risk.

# Example 15.5 Bond Prices and Forward Rates with Interest Rate Risk

Suppose that most investors have short-term horizons and therefore are willing to hold the 2-year bond only if its price falls to 881.83. At this price, the expected holding-period return on the 2-year bond is 7\% (because 943.40 / 881.83 = 1.07). The risk premium of the 2-year bond, therefore, is 2\%; it offers an expected rate of return of 7\% versus the 5\% risk-free return on the 1-year bond. At this risk premium, investors are willing to bear the price risk associated with interest rate uncertainty.

When bond prices reflect a risk premium, however, the forward rate,  $f_{2}$ , no longer equals the expected short rate,  $E(r_{2})$ . Although we have assumed that  $E(r_{2}) = 6\%$ , it is easy to confirm that  $f_{2} = 8\%$ . The yield to maturity on a 2-year zero selling at 881.83 is 6.49\%, and

$$
1 + f _ {2} = \frac {(1 + y _ {2}) ^ {2}}{1 + y _ {1}} = \frac {1 . 0 6 4 9 ^ {2}}{1 . 0 5} = 1. 0 8
$$

The result in Example 15.5—that the forward rate exceeds the expected short rate—should not surprise us. We defined the forward rate as the interest rate in the second year required to make the long- and short-term investments equally attractive, ignoring risk. But when we account for risk, short-term investors will shy away from the long-term bond unless its expected return is higher. Therefore, the expected value of the short rate must be less than the break-even value,  $f_{2}$ , because the lower the expectation of  $r_{2}$ , the greater the anticipated return on the long-term bond.

Therefore, if most individuals are short-term investors,  $f_{2}$  must be greater than  $E(r_{2})$ . The forward rate will embody a premium compared with the expected future short-interest rate. This liquidity premium compensates short-term investors for the uncertainty about the price at which they will be able to sell their long-term bonds at the end of the year.

# Concept Check 15.5

Suppose that the required liquidity premium for the short-term investor is  $1\%$ . What must  $E(r_{2})$  be if  $f_{2}$  is  $7\%$ ?

Perhaps surprisingly, we also can imagine scenarios in which long-term bonds can be perceived by investors to be safer than short-term bonds. To see how, we now consider "long-term" investors who wish to invest for a full 2-year period. Suppose they can purchase a  \$1,000 par value 2-year zero-coupon bond for\$ 890 and lock in a guaranteed yield to maturity of  $y_{2} = 6\%$ . Alternatively, they can roll over two 1-year investments. In this case, an investment of \$890 would grow in two years to  $890 \times 1.05 \times (1 + r_{2})$ , which is an uncertain amount today because  $r_{2}$  is not yet known. The break-even year 2 interest rate is, once again, the forward rate,  $7.01\%$ .

The expected value of the payoff of the rollover strategy is  $890 \times 1.05 \times [1 + E(r_2)]$ . If  $E(r_2)$  equals the forward rate,  $f_2$ , then the expected value of the payoff from the rollover strategy will equal the known payoff from the 2-year-maturity-bond strategy.

Is this a reasonable presumption? Once again, it is reasonable only if the investor does not care about the uncertainty surrounding the final value of the rollover strategy. But if that risk is important, the long-term investor will not be willing to engage in the rollover strategy unless its expected return exceeds that of the 2-year bond. In this case, the investor would require that

$$
(1. 0 5) [ 1 + E (r _ {2}) ] > (1. 0 6) ^ {2} = (1. 0 5) (1 + f _ {2})
$$ which implies that  $E(r_2)$  exceeds  $f_2$ .


Therefore, if all investors were long-term investors, no one would be willing to hold short-term bonds unless rolling over those bonds offered a reward for bearing interest rate risk. This would cause the forward rate to be less than the expected future spot rate.

For example, suppose that in fact  $E(r_2) = 8\%$ . The liquidity premium therefore is negative:  $f_2 - E(r_2) = 7.01\% - 8\% = -.99\%$ . This is exactly opposite from the conclusion that we drew in the first case of the short-term investor. Clearly, whether forward rates will equal expected future short rates depends on investors' readiness to bear interest rate risk, as well as their willingness to hold bonds that do not correspond to their investment horizons.

# 15.4 Theories of the Term Structure

# The Expectations Hypothesis

The simplest theory of the term structure is the expectations hypothesis. A common version states that the forward rate equals the market consensus expectation of the future short interest rate; that is,  $f_{2} = E(r_{2})$ , and liquidity premiums are zero. If  $f_{2} = E(r_{2})$ , yields on long-term bonds depend only on expectations of future short rates. Therefore, we can use forward rates to infer market expectations of future short rates. For example, with  $(1 + y_{2})^{2} = (1 + r_{1}) \times (1 + f_{2})$  from Equation 15.5, the expectations hypothesis would imply that  $(1 + y_{2})^{2} = (1 + r_{1}) \times [1 + E(r_{2})]$ . The yield to maturity would thus be determined solely by current and expected future one-period interest rates. An upward-sloping yield curve would be clear evidence that investors anticipate increases in interest rates.

# Concept Check 15.6

If the expectations hypothesis is valid, what can we conclude about the premiums necessary to induce investors to hold bonds of different maturities from their investment horizons?

# The Expectations Hypothesis and Forward Inflation Rates

Forward rates derived from conventional bonds are nominal interest rates. But by using price-level-indexed bonds such as TIPS, we can also calculate forward real interest rates. Recall that the difference between the real rate and the nominal rate is approximately the expected inflation rate. Therefore, comparing real and nominal forward rates might give us a glimpse of the market's expectation of future inflation rates. The real versus nominal spread is a sort of forward inflation rate.

As part of its monetary policy, the Federal Reserve Board periodically reduces its target federal funds rate in an attempt to stimulate the economy. The following page captures from a Bloomberg screen shows the minute-by-minute spread between the 5-year forward nominal interest rate and forward real rate on one day the Fed announced such a policy change. The spread immediately widened at the announcement, signifying that the market expected the more expansionary monetary policy to eventually result in a higher inflation rate. The increase in the inflation rate implied by the graph is fairly mild, about .05\%, from about 2.53\% to 2.58\%, but the impact of the announcement is very clear, and the speed of adjustment to the announcement was impressive.


![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/2fea450f8ea79529092e3807f322744e5d4e450aec2ca486c18cbeb6f78e5672.jpg)

By the way, nothing limits us to nominal bonds when using the expectations hypothesis. The nearby box points out that we can apply the theory to the term structure of real interest rates as well, and thereby learn something about market expectations of coming inflation rates.

# Liquidity Preference Theory

We've seen that short-term investors will be unwilling to hold long-term bonds unless the forward rate exceeds the expected short interest rate,  $f_{2} > E(r_{2})$ , whereas long-term investors will be unwilling to hold short bonds unless  $E(r_{2}) > f_{2}$ . In other words, both groups of investors require a premium to hold bonds with maturities different from their investment horizons. Advocates of the liquidity preference theory of the term structure believe that short-term investors dominate the market so that the forward rate will generally exceed the expected short rate. The excess of  $f_{2}$  over  $E(r_{2})$ , the liquidity premium, is predicted to be positive.

# Concept Check 15.7

The liquidity premium hypothesis also holds that issuers of bonds prefer to issue long-term bonds to lock in borrowing costs. How would this preference contribute to a positive liquidity premium?

To illustrate the differing implications of these theories, suppose the short interest rate is expected to be constant indefinitely. Specifically, suppose that  $r_1 = 5\%$  and that  $E(r_2) = 5\%$ ,  $E(r_3) = 5\%$ , and so on. Under the expectations hypothesis, the 2-year yield to maturity could be derived from the following:

$$
\begin{array}{l} (1 + y _ {2}) ^ {2} = (1 + r _ {1}) [ 1 + E (r _ {2}) ] \\ = (1. 0 5) (1. 0 5) \\ \end{array}
$$ so that  $y_{2}$  equals  $5\%$ . Similarly, yields on bonds of all maturities would equal  $5\%$ .


In contrast, under the liquidity preference theory,  $f_{2}$  would exceed  $E(r_{2})$ . For example, suppose the liquidity premium is  $1\%$ , so  $f_{2}$  is  $6\%$ . Then, for 2-year bonds:

$$
\begin{array}{l} (1 + y _ {2}) ^ {2} = (1 + r _ {1}) (1 + f _ {2}) \\ = 1. 0 5 \times 1. 0 6 = 1. 1 1 3 \\ \end{array}
$$ implying that  $1 + y_{2} = 1.055$ . Similarly, if  $f_{3}$  also equals  $6\%$ , then the yield on 3-year bonds would be determined by


$$
\begin{array}{l} (1 + y _ {3}) ^ {3} = (1 + r _ {1}) (1 + f _ {2}) (1 + f _ {3}) \\ = 1. 0 5 \times 1. 0 6 \times 1. 0 6 = 1. 1 7 9 7 8 \\ \end{array}
$$ implying that  $1 + y_{3} = 1.0567$ . The plot of the yield curve in this situation would be given as in Figure 15.4, Panel A. Such an upward-sloping yield curve is commonly observed in practice.

If interest rates are expected to change over time, then the liquidity premium may be overlaid on the path of expected short rates to determine the forward interest rate. Then the yield to maturity for each date will be an average of the single-period forward rates. Several such possibilities for increasing and declining interest rates appear in Figure 15.4, Panels B-D.

# Market Segmentation

Both the liquidity premium and expectations hypotheses treat bonds of various maturities as potential substitutes for each other. An investor considering bonds of one maturity can be lured into bonds of another by the prospect of earning a risk premium. In this sense, the markets for bonds of all maturities are linked, with yields on short- and long-term bonds determined jointly in market equilibrium. Forward rates cannot differ by expected short rates by more than a "fair" liquidity premium, or else investors will reallocate their portfolios to exploit what they perceive as abnormal profit opportunities.

In contrast, the market segmentation theory holds that long- and short-maturity bonds trade in essentially distinct and unconnected markets, each of which finds its own equilibrium independently. The term structure in this view is determined by the rates set in these segmented markets. This view of the market is less common today, as it seems clear that investors must compare long and short rates as well as expectations of future rates before deciding where to invest.

On the other hand, some investors may face binding limitations on their ability to shift from one maturity to another. For example, money market funds, a huge component of the fixed-income universe, must invest only in very-short-term securities regardless of current and expected rates in the rest of the fixed-income market. If these sorts of restrictions affect a large enough portion of the market, they can at least potentially lead to segmentation across maturity levels. And, in fact, it does appear that very-short-maturity instruments are characterized by rates consistently lower than those at longer ends of the term structure, consistent with a segmented market.

# 15.5 Interpreting the Term Structure

If the yield curve reflects expectations of future short rates, then it offers a potentially powerful tool for fixed-income investors. If we can use the term structure to infer the expectations of other investors in the economy, we can use those expectations as benchmarks for our own analysis. For example, if we are relatively more optimistic than other investors that interest rates will fall, we will be more willing to extend our portfolios into longer-term bonds. Therefore, in this section, we will take a careful look at what information can be gleaned from a careful analysis of the term structure. Unfortunately, while the yield curve does reflect expectations of future interest rates, it also reflects other factors such as liquidity premiums. Moreover, forecasts of interest rate changes may have different investment implications depending on whether those changes are driven by changes in the expected inflation rate or the real rate, and this adds another layer of complexity to the interpretation of the term structure.

We have seen that under certainty, 1 plus the yield to maturity on a zero-coupon bond is simply the geometric average of 1 plus the future short rates that will prevail over the life of the bond. This is the meaning of Equation 15.1, which we give in general form here:

$$
1 + y _ {n} = \left[ \left(1 + r _ {1}\right) \left(1 + r _ {2}\right) \dots \left(1 + r _ {n}\right) \right] ^ {1 / n}
$$

When future rates are uncertain, we modify Equation 15.1 by replacing future short rates with forward rates:

$$
1 + y _ {n} = \left[ \left(1 + r _ {1}\right) \left(1 + f _ {2}\right) \left(1 + f _ {3}\right) \dots \left(1 + f _ {n}\right) \right] ^ {1 / n} \tag {15.7}
$$

Thus, there is a direct relationship between yields on various maturity bonds and forward interest rates.

First, we ask what factors can account for a rising yield curve. Mathematically, if the yield curve is rising,  $f_{n+1}$  must exceed  $y_n$ . In words, the yield curve is upward-sloping at any maturity date,  $n$ , for which the forward rate for the coming period is greater than the yield at that maturity. This rule follows from the notion of the yield to maturity as an average (albeit a geometric average) of forward rates.

If the yield curve rises as one moves to longer maturities, the extension to a longer maturity must result in the inclusion of a "new" forward rate higher than the average of the previously observed rates. This is analogous to the observation that if a new student's test score increases the class average, that additional score must exceed the class's average without it. Similarly, to increase the yield to maturity, an above-average forward rate must be added to the other rates already included in the average.


# Example 15.6 Forward Rates and the Slopes of the Yield Curve

If the yield to maturity on 3-year zero-coupon bonds is  $7\%$ , then the yield on 4-year bonds will satisfy the following equation:

$$
(1 + y _ {4}) ^ {4} = (1. 0 7) ^ {3} (1 + f _ {4})
$$

If  $f_4 = .07$ , then  $y_4$  also will equal .07. (Confirm this!) If  $f_4$  is greater than  $7\%$ ,  $y_4$  will exceed  $7\%$ , and the yield curve will slope upward. For example, if  $f_4 = .08$ , then  $(1 + y_4)^4 = (1.07)^3 (1.08) = 1.3230$ , and  $y_4 = .0725$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/ddd2217c2f34b5ad42f84020fead439b66705e4d1c8fb220fa1c68ba6e7f09ea.jpg)

# Concept Check 15.8

Look back at Table 15.1. Show that  $y_{4}$  will exceed  $y_{3}$  if and only if the forward interest rate for period 4 is greater than  $7\%$ , which is the yield to maturity on the 3-year bond,  $y_{3}$ .

Given that an upward-sloping yield curve implies a forward rate higher than the spot, or current, yield to maturity, we ask next what can account for that higher forward rate. The challenge is that there always are two possible answers to this question. Recall that the forward rate can be related to the expected future short rate according to

$$ f _ {n} = E \left(r _ {n}\right) + \text {L i q u i d i t y p r e m i u m} \tag {15.8}
$$ where the liquidity premium might be necessary to induce investors to hold bonds of maturities that do not correspond to their preferred investment horizons.


By the way, the liquidity premium need not be positive, although that is the prediction of the liquidity premium hypothesis. We saw previously that if most investors have long-term horizons, the liquidity premium could be negative.

In any case, Equation 15.8 shows that there are two reasons that the forward rate could be high. Either investors expect rising interest rates, meaning that  $E(r_{n})$  is high, or they require a premium for holding longer-term bonds. Although it is tempting to infer from a rising yield curve that investors believe that interest rates will eventually increase, this does not necessarily follow. Indeed, Panel A in Figure 15.4 provides a simple counterexample. There, the short rate is expected to stay at  $5\%$  forever. Yet there is a constant  $1\%$  liquidity premium so that all forward rates are  $6\%$ . The result is that the yield curve continually rises, starting at a level of  $5\%$  for 1-year bonds, but eventually approaching  $6\%$  for long-term bonds as more and more forward rates at  $6\%$  are averaged into the yields to maturity.

Therefore, while expectations of increases in future interest rates can result in a rising yield curve, the converse is not true: A rising yield curve does not in and of itself imply expectations of higher future interest rates. Potential liquidity premiums complicate attempts to extract market expectations from the term structure. Nevertheless, you have to compare your own expectations to those reflected in market prices to determine whether you are relatively bullish or bearish on interest rates.

One very rough approach to deriving expected future spot rates is to assume that liquidity premiums are constant. An estimate of that premium can be subtracted from the forward rate to obtain the market's expected interest rate. For example, again making use of the example plotted in Panel A of Figure 15.4, the researcher would estimate from historical data that a typical liquidity premium in this economy is  $1\%$ . After calculating the forward rate from the yield curve to be  $6\%$ , the expectation of the future spot rate would be determined to be  $5\%$ .


This approach has little to recommend it for two reasons. First, it is next to impossible to obtain precise estimates of a liquidity premium. The general approach to doing so would be to compare forward rates and eventually realized future short rates and to calculate the average difference between the two. However, as an empirical matter, deviations between the two values can be large and unpredictable. The data are too noisy to calculate a reliable estimate of the expected premium. Second, there is no reason to believe that the liquidity premium should be constant. Figure 15.5 shows the rate of return variability of prices of long-term Treasury bonds since 1971. Interest rate risk fluctuated dramatically during the period. So we should expect risk premiums on various maturity bonds to fluctuate, and empirical evidence suggests that liquidity premiums do in fact fluctuate over time.

Still, very steep yield curves are interpreted by many market professionals as warning signs of impending rate increases. In fact, the yield curve is a good predictor of the business cycle as a whole because long-term rates tend to rise in anticipation of an expansion in economic activity.

The usually observed upward slope of the yield curve, especially for short maturities, is the empirical basis for the liquidity premium doctrine that long-term bonds offer a positive liquidity premium. Because the yield curve normally has an upward slope, a downward-sloping yield curve is taken as a strong indication that yields are more likely than not to fall. The prediction of declining interest rates is, in turn, often interpreted as a signal of a coming recession. For this reason, it is not surprising that the slope of the yield curve is one of the key components of the index of leading economic indicators.

Figure 15.6 presents a history of yields on 90-day Treasury bills and 10-year Treasury bonds. Yields on the longer-term bonds generally exceed those on the bills, meaning that the yield curve generally slopes upward. Moreover, the exceptions to this rule do seem to precede episodes of falling short rates, which, if anticipated, would induce a downward-sloping yield curve. For example, the figure shows that 1980-1981 were years in which 90-day yields exceeded long-term yields. These years preceded both a drastic drop in the general level of rates and a steep recession. (One notable exception to this typical pattern is the COVID-19 recession in 2020. The onset of this

Why might interest rates fall? There are two factors to consider: the real rate and the inflation premium. Recall that the nominal interest rate is composed of the real rate plus a factor to compensate for the effect of inflation:

$$
1 + \text {N o m i n a l r a t e} = (1 + \text {R e a l r a t e}) (1 + \text {I n f l a t i o n r a t e})
$$ or, approximately,


$$
\text {N o m i n a l r a t e} \approx \text {R e a l r a t e} + \text {I n f l a t i o n r a t e}
$$

Therefore, an expected change in interest rates can be due to changes in either expected real rates or expected inflation rates. Usually, it is important to distinguish between these two possibilities because the economic environments associated with them may vary substantially. High real rates may indicate a rapidly expanding economy, high government budget deficits, and tight monetary policy. Although high inflation rates can arise out of a rapidly expanding economy, inflation also may be caused by rapid expansion of the money supply or supply-side shocks to the economy such as interruptions in energy supplies. These factors have very different implications for investments. Even if we conclude from an analysis of the yield curve that rates will fall, we need to analyze the macroeconomic factors that might cause such a decline.

# 15.6 Forward Rates as Forward Contracts

We have seen that forward rates may be derived from the yield curve, using Equation 15.5. In general, they will not equal the eventually realized short rate, or even today's expectation of what that short rate will be. But there is still an important sense in which the forward rate is a market interest rate.

Suppose that you wanted to arrange now to make a loan at some future date. You would agree today on the interest rate that will be charged, but the loan would not commence until some time in the future. How would the interest rate on such a "forward loan" be determined? Perhaps not surprisingly, it would be the forward rate of interest for the period of the loan. Let's use an example to see how this might work.


# Example 15.7 Forward Interest Rate Contract

Suppose the price of 1-year-maturity zero-coupon bonds with face value  \$1,000 is\$ 952.38 and the price of 2-year zeros with  \$1,000 face value is\$ 890. The yield to maturity on the 1-year bond is therefore 5\%, while that on the 2-year bond is 6\%. The forward rate for the second year is thus

$$ f _ {2} = \frac {\left(1 + y _ {2}\right) ^ {2}}{\left(1 + y _ {1}\right)} - 1 = \frac {1.06 ^ {2}}{1.05} - 1 = .0701, \text {or} 7.01 \%
$$

Now consider the strategy laid out in the following table. In the first column, we present data for this example, and in the last column we generalize. We denote by  $B_0(T)$  today's price of a zero-coupon bond with face value \$1,000 maturing at time  $T$ .

<table><tr><td></td><td>Initial Cash Flow</td><td>In General</td></tr><tr><td>Buy a 1-year zero-coupon bond</td><td>-952.38</td><td>-B0(1)</td></tr><tr><td>Sell 1.0701 2-year zeros</td><td>+890 × 1.0701 = 952.38</td><td>+B0(2) × (1 + f2)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

The initial cash flow (at time 0) is zero. You pay 952.38, or in general B_{0}(1), for a zero maturing in one year, and you receive \$890, or in general B_{0}(2), for each zero you sell maturing in two years. By selling 1.0701 of these bonds, you set your initial cash flow to zero.^{4}

At time 1, the 1-year bond matures and you receive 1,000. At time 2, the 2-year-maturity zero-coupon bonds that you sold mature, and you have to pay 1.0701 \times 1,000 = \$1,070.10. Your cash flow stream is shown in Figure 15.7, Panel A. Notice that you have created a "synthetic" forward loan: You effectively will borrow \$1,000 a year from now and repay 1,070.10 a year later. The rate on this forward loan is therefore 7.01\%, precisely equal to the forward rate for the second year.

In general, to construct the synthetic forward loan, you sell  $(1 + f_{2})$  2-year zeros for every 1-year zero that you buy. This makes your initial cash flow zero because the prices of the 1- and 2-year zeros differ by the multiple  $(1 + f_{2})$ ; notice that

$$
B _ {0} (1) = \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 , 0 0 0}{\left(1 + y _ {1}\right)}, \text {w h i l e} B _ {0} (2) = \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 , 0 0 0}{\left(1 + y _ {2}\right) ^ {2}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 , 0 0 0}{\left(1 + y _ {1}\right) \left(1 + f _ {2}\right)}
$$

Therefore, when you sell  $(1 + f_2)$  2-year zeros, you generate just enough cash to buy one 1-year zero. Both zeros mature to a face value of \$1,000, so the difference between the cash inflow at time 1 and the cash outflow at time 2 is the same factor,  $1 + f_2$ , as illustrated in Figure 15.7, Panel B. As a result,  $f_2$  is the rate on the forward loan.

Obviously, you can construct a synthetic forward loan for periods beyond the second year, and you can construct such loans for multiple periods. For example, if you want to obtain a forward loan that begins in year 3 and ends in year 5, you would issue a 5-year zero-coupon bond (thus borrowing for five years) and buy a 3-year zero (thus lending for three years). Your borrowing and lending positions cancel out for the first three years, effectively leaving you with a borrowing position that starts after year 3 and continues until the end of year 5. Problems 18 and 19 at the end of the chapter lead you through the details of some of these variants.

# Concept Check 15.9

Continuing Example 15.7, now suppose that the price of 3-year zero-coupon bonds is 816.30. What is the forward rate for the third year? How would you construct a synthetic 1-year forward loan that commences at  t = 2  and matures at  t = 3 ?

# SUMMARY

1. The term structure of interest rates refers to the interest rates for various terms to maturity embodied in the prices of default-free zero-coupon bonds.
2. In a world of certainty, all investments must provide equal total returns for any investment period. Short-term holding-period returns on all bonds would be equal in a risk-free economy; all returns would be equal to the rate available on short-term bonds. Similarly, total returns from rolling over short-term bonds over longer periods would equal the total return available from long-maturity bonds.
3. The forward rate of interest is the break-even future interest rate that would equate the total return from a rollover strategy to that of a longer-term zero-coupon bond. It is defined by the equation

$$
(1 + y _ {n - 1}) ^ {n - 1} (1 + f _ {n}) = (1 + y _ {n}) ^ {n}
$$ where  $n$  is a given number of periods from today. This equation can be used to show that yields to maturity and forward rates are related by the equation


$$
(1 + y _ {n}) ^ {n} = (1 + r _ {1}) (1 + f _ {2}) (1 + f _ {3}) \dots (1 + f _ {n})
$$

4. A common version of the expectations hypothesis holds that forward interest rates are unbiased estimates of expected future interest rates. However, there are good reasons to believe that forward rates differ from expected short rates because of a risk premium known as a liquidity premium. A positive liquidity premium can cause the yield curve to slope upward even if no increase in short rates is anticipated.
5. The existence of liquidity premiums complicates attempts to infer expected future interest rates from the yield curve. Such an inference would be made easier if we could assume the liquidity premium remained reasonably stable over time. However, both empirical and theoretical considerations cast doubt on the constancy of that premium.


6. Forward rates are market interest rates in the important sense that commitments to forward (i.e., deferred) borrowing or lending arrangements can be made at these rates.

Briefly discuss why zero-coupon stripped U.S. Treasuries could have higher yields to maturity than coupon U.S. Treasuries with the same final maturity.

8. The shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve appears to reflect two expected Federal Reserve reductions in the federal funds rate. The current short-term interest rate is  $5\%$ . The first reduction of approximately 50 basis points (bp) is expected six months from now, and the second reduction of approximately 50 bp is expected one year from now. The current U.S. Treasury term premiums are 10 bp per year for each of the next three years (out through the 3-year benchmark).

However, the market also believes that the Federal Reserve reductions will be reversed in a single 100-bp increase in the federal funds rate  $2^{1/2}$  years from now. You expect liquidity premiums to remain 10 bp per year for each of the next three years (out through the 3-year benchmark).

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. The price of the 3-year bond paying a 40 coupon is

$$
\frac {4 0}{1 . 0 5} + \frac {4 0}{1 . 0 6 ^ {2}} + \frac {1 . 0 4 0}{1 . 0 7 ^ {3}} = 3 8. 0 9 5 + 3 5. 6 0 0 + 8 4 8. 9 5 0 = \$ 9 2 2. 6 5
$$

At this price, the yield to maturity is  $6.945\%$ $[n = 3; \mathrm{PV} = (-)922.65; \mathrm{FV} = 1,000; \mathrm{PMT} = 40]$ . This bond's yield to maturity is closer to that of the 3-year zero-coupon bond than is the yield to maturity of the  $10\%$  coupon bond in Example 15.1. This makes sense: This bond's coupon rate is lower than that of the bond in Example 15.1. A greater fraction of its value is tied up in the final payment in the third year, and so it is not surprising that its yield is closer to that of a pure 3-year zero-coupon security.

2. We compare two investment strategies in a manner similar to Example 15.2:

Buy and hold 4-year zero  $=$  Buy 3-year zero; roll proceeds into 1-year bond

$$
(1 + y _ {4}) ^ {4} = (1 + y _ {3}) ^ {3} \times (1 + r _ {4})
$$

$$
1. 0 8 ^ {4} = 1. 0 7 ^ {3} \times (1 + r _ {4})
$$ which implies that  $r_4 = 1.08^4 / 1.07^3 - 1 = .11056 = 11.056\%$ . Now we confirm that the yield on the 4-year zero reflects the geometric average of the discount factors for the next 3 years:


$$
1 + y _ {4} = \left[ \left(1 + r _ {1}\right) \times \left(1 + r _ {2}\right) \times \left(1 + r _ {3}\right) \times \left(1 + r _ {4}\right) \right] ^ {1 / 4}
$$

$$
1. 0 8 = [ 1. 0 5 \times 1. 0 7 0 1 \times 1. 0 9 0 2 5 \times 1. 1 1 0 5 6 ] ^ {1 / 4}
$$

3. The 3-year bond can be bought today for $1,000/1.07³ = $816.30. Next year, it will have a remaining maturity of two years. The short rate in year 2 will be 7.01\% and the short rate in year 3 will be  $9.025\%$ . Therefore, the bond's yield to maturity next year will be related to these short rates according to


$$
(1 + y _ {2}) ^ {2} = 1. 0 7 0 1 \times 1. 0 9 0 2 5 = 1. 1 6 6 7
$$ and its price next year will be 1,000 / (1 + y_2)^2 = \ 1,000 / 1.1667 = \ 857.12. The 1-year holding-period rate of return is therefore (\ 857.12 - \$ 816.30)/\$ 816.30 = .05, or 5\%


4. The  $n$ -period spot rate is the yield to maturity on a zero-coupon bond with a maturity of  $n$  periods. The short rate for period  $n$  is the one-period interest rate that will prevail in that period. Finally, the forward rate for period  $n$  is the short rate for that period that would satisfy a "break-even condition" equating the total returns on two  $n$ -period investment strategies. The first strategy is an investment in an  $n$ -period zero-coupon bond; the second is an investment in an  $(n - 1)$ -period zero-coupon bond "rolled over" into an investment in a one-period zero. Spot rates and forward rates are observable today, but because interest rates evolve with uncertainty, future short rates are not. In the special case in which there is no uncertainty in future interest rates, the forward rate calculated from the yield curve would equal the short rate that will prevail in that period.

5.  $7\% - 1\% = 6\%$ .
6. The risk premium will be zero.
7. If issuers prefer to issue long-term bonds, they will be willing to accept higher expected interest costs on long bonds over short bonds. This willingness combines with investors' demands for higher rates on long-term bonds to reinforce the tendency toward a positive liquidity premium.
8. In general, from Equation 15.5,  $(1 + y_{n})^{n} = (1 + y_{n - 1})^{n - 1} \times (1 + f_{n})$ . In this case,  $(1 + y_{4})^{4} = (1.07)^{3} \times (1 + f_{4})$ . If  $f_{4} = .07$ , then  $(1 + y_{4})^{4} = (1.07)^{4}$  and  $y_{4} = .07$ . If  $f_{4}$  is greater than .07, then  $y_{4}$  also will be greater, and conversely if  $f_{4}$  is less than .07, then  $y_{4}$  will be as well.
9. The 3-year yield to maturity is  $\left(\frac{1,000}{816.30}\right)^{1/3} - 1 = .07 = 7.0\%$

The forward rate for the third year is therefore

$$ f_{3} = \frac{(1 + y_{3})^{3}}{(1 + y_{2})^{2}} -1 = \frac{1.07^{3}}{1.06^{2}} -1 = .0903 = 9.03\%
$$

(Alternatively, note that the ratio of the price of the 2-year zero to the price of the 3-year zero is  $1 + f_{3} = 1.0903$ .) To construct the synthetic loan, buy one 2-year maturity zero and sell 1.0903 3-year maturity zeros. Your initial cash flow is zero, your cash flow at time 2 is  $+\$ 1,000$ , and your cash flow at time 3 is  $-\$ 1,090.30$ , which corresponds to the cash flows on a 1-year forward loan commencing at time 2 with an interest rate of  $9.03\%$ .

# Managing Bond Portfolios

# 16

IN THIS CHAPTER we turn to various fixed-income portfolio strategies, making a distinction between passive and active approaches. Rather than attempting to beat the market by exploiting superior information or insight, a passive investment strategy seeks only to maintain an appropriate risk-return balance given market opportunities. One special case of passive management for fixed-income portfolios is a strategy that attempts to insulate or "immunize" the portfolio from interest rate risk.

In contrast, an active investment strategy attempts to achieve returns more than commensurate with risk. Active fixed-income managers use either interest rate forecasts to predict movements in the entire bond market or some form of intramarket analysis to identify particular sectors of the market or particular bonds that are relatively mispriced.

Because interest rate risk is crucial to formulating both active and passive strategies, we begin by showing how to measure the sensitivity of bond prices to interest rate fluctuations. This sensitivity is called the duration of the bond, and we devote considerable attention to what determines bond duration. We discuss several passive investment strategies and show how duration-matching techniques can be used to immunize the holding-period return of a portfolio from interest rate risk. After examining a broad range of applications of the duration measure, we consider refinements in the way that interest rate sensitivity is measured, focusing on the concept of bond convexity.


Duration is important in formulating active investment strategies as well, and we conclude with a discussion of active fixed-income strategies. These include policies based on interest rate forecasting as well as intramarket analysis that seeks to identify relatively attractive sectors or securities within the fixed-income market.

# 16.1 Interest Rate Risk

You already know that bond prices and yields are inversely related, and that interest rates can fluctuate substantially. As rates rise and fall, bondholders experience capital losses and gains. Therefore, fixed-income investments can be risky, even if the coupon and principal payments are guaranteed, as in the case of Treasury obligations.

Why do bond prices respond to interest rate fluctuations? Remember that in a competitive market, all securities must offer investors fair expected rates of return. If a bond is issued with a  $6\%$  coupon when competitive yields are  $6\%$ , then it will sell at par value. If the market rate rises to  $7\%$ , however, who would be willing to pay par value for a bond offering only a  $6\%$  coupon? The bond price must fall until its expected return increases to the competitive level of  $7\%$ . Conversely, if the market rate falls to  $5\%$ , the  $6\%$  coupon on the bond will be attractive compared to yields on alternative investments. In response, investors eager for that return will bid up the bond price until the expected rate of return at that higher price is no better than the market rate.

# Interest Rate Sensitivity

The sensitivity of bond prices to changes in market interest rates is obviously of great concern to investors. To gain some insight into the determinants of interest rate risk, turn to Figure 16.1, which presents the percentage change in price corresponding to changes in yield to maturity for four bonds that differ according to coupon rate, initial yield to maturity, and time to maturity. All four bonds illustrate that bond prices decrease when yields rise and that the price curve is convex, meaning that decreases in yields have bigger impacts on price than increases in yields of equal magnitude. We summarize these observations in the following two propositions:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/a077fe27729e8467b20151dc0039a0aecbf845615fbea8914f11cb9b74dd9fe1.jpg)
Figure 16.1 Change in bond price as a function of change in yield to maturity


1. Bond prices and yields are inversely related: As yields increase, bond prices fall; as yields fall, bond prices rise.
2. An increase in a bond's yield to maturity results in a smaller price change than a decrease in yield of equal magnitude.

Now, compare the interest rate sensitivity of bonds  $A$  and  $B$ , which are identical except for maturity. Figure 16.1 shows that bond  $B$ , which has a longer maturity than bond  $A$ , exhibits greater sensitivity to interest rate changes. This illustrates another general property:

3. Prices of long-term bonds tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than prices of short-term bonds.

This is not surprising. If rates increase, for example, the bond is less valuable as its cash flows are discounted at a now-higher rate. The impact of the higher discount rate will be greater as that rate is applied to more-distant cash flows.

While bond  $B$  has six times the maturity of bond  $A$ , it has less than six times the interest rate sensitivity. Although interest rate sensitivity generally increases with maturity, it does so less than proportionally as bond maturity increases. Therefore, our fourth property is that

4. The sensitivity of bond prices to changes in yields increases at a decreasing rate as maturity increases. In other words, interest rate risk is less than proportional to bond maturity.

Bonds  $B$  and  $C$ , which are alike in all respects except for coupon rate, illustrate another point. The lower-coupon bond exhibits greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates. This turns out to be a general property of bond prices:

5. Interest rate risk is inversely related to the bond's coupon rate. Prices of low-coupon bonds are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than prices of high-coupon bonds.

Finally, bonds  $C$  and  $D$  are identical except for the yield to maturity at which the bonds currently sell. Yet bond  $C$ , with a higher yield to maturity, is less sensitive to changes in yields. This illustrates our final property:

6. The sensitivity of a bond's price to a change in its yield is inversely related to the yield to maturity at which the bond currently is selling.

The first five of these general properties were described by Malkiel and are sometimes known as Malkiel's bond-pricing relationships. The last property was demonstrated by Homer and Liebowitz.

Maturity is a major determinant of interest rate risk. However, maturity alone is not sufficient to measure interest rate sensitivity. For example, bonds  $B$  and  $C$  in Figure 16.1 have the same maturity, but the higher-coupon bond has less price sensitivity to interest rate changes. Obviously, interest rate risk depends on more than maturity.

Table 16.1
Prices of  $8 \%$ coupon bond (coupons paid semiannually)

<table><tr><td>Yield to Maturity (APR)</td><td>T = 1 Year</td><td>T = 10 Years</td><td>T = 20 Years</td></tr><tr><td>8\%</td><td>1,000.00</td><td>1,000.00</td><td>1,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>9\%</td><td>990.64</td><td>934.96</td><td>907.99</td></tr><tr><td>Fall in price (\%)*</td><td>0.94\%</td><td>6.50\%</td><td>9.20\%</td></tr></table>

*Equals value of bond at a 9\% yield to maturity divided by value of bond at (the original) 8\% yield, minus 1.

To see why the coupon rate or yield to maturity also affects interest rate sensitivity, let's start with a simple numerical example. Table 16.1 gives bond prices for  $8\%$  semiannual coupon bonds at different yields to maturity and times to maturity,  $T$ . [The interest rates are expressed as annual percentage rates (APRs), meaning that the 6-month yield is doubled to obtain the stated annual yield.] The value of the shortest-term bond falls by less than  $1\%$  when the interest rate increases from  $8\%$  to  $9\%$ . The 10-year bond falls by  $6.5\%$ , and the 20-year bond by over  $9\%$ .

Now look at a similar computation using a zero-coupon bond rather than the  $8\%$  coupon bond. The results are shown in Table 16.2. For each maturity, the price of the zero-coupon bond falls by a greater proportional amount than that of the  $8\%$  coupon bond. Because we know that long-term bonds are more sensitive to interest rate movements, the greater sensitivity of zero-coupon bonds suggests that in some sense they must represent a longer-term investment than an equal-time-to-maturity coupon bond.

In fact, this insight about the effective maturity of a bond can be made mathematically precise. The 20-year  $8\%$  bond makes many coupon payments, most of which come years before the bond's maturity date. Each payment may be considered to have its own "maturity." In the previous chapter, we pointed out that it can be useful to view a coupon bond as a "portfolio" of coupon payments. The effective maturity of the bond is therefore some sort of average of the maturities of all the cash flows. The zero-coupon bond, by contrast, makes only one payment at maturity. Its time to maturity is, therefore, well defined.

Higher-coupon-rate bonds have a higher fraction of value tied to coupons rather than final payment of par value, and so the "portfolio of payments" is more heavily weighted toward the earlier, short-maturity payments, which gives it lower "effective maturity." This explains Malkiel's fifth rule, that price sensitivity falls with coupon rate.

Similar logic explains our sixth rule, that price sensitivity falls with yield to maturity. A higher yield reduces the present value of all of the bond's payments, but more so for more-distant payments. Therefore, at a higher yield, a higher proportion of the bond's value is due to its earlier payments, so effective maturity and interest rate sensitivity are lower.

Table 16.2
Prices of zero-coupon bond (semiannual compounding)

<table><tr><td>Yield to Maturity (APR)</td><td>T = 1 Year</td><td>T = 10 Years</td><td>T = 20 Years</td></tr><tr><td>8\%</td><td>924.56</td><td>456.39</td><td>208.29</td></tr><tr><td>9\%</td><td>915.73</td><td>414.64</td><td>171.93</td></tr><tr><td>Fall in price (\%)*</td><td>0.96\%</td><td>9.15\%</td><td>17.46\%</td></tr></table>

*Equals value of bond at a 9\% yield to maturity divided by value of bond at (the original) 8\% yield, minus 1.

# Duration

To measure the effective maturity of a bond making many payments, we average over the maturity of each of the bond's cash flows. Frederick Macaulay called this average the duration of the bond. Macaulay's duration equals the weighted average of the times to each coupon or principal payment, with weights related to the "importance" of that payment to the value of the bond. Specifically, the weight applied to each payment time is the proportion of the total value of the bond accounted for by that payment, that is, the present value of the payment divided by the bond price.

We define the weight,  $w_{t}$ , associated with the cash flow made at time  $t$  (denoted  $\mathrm{CF}_t$ ) as

$$ w _ {t} = \frac {\mathrm {C F} _ {t} / (1 + y) ^ {t}}{\text {B o n d p r i c e}}
$$ where  $y$  is the bond's yield to maturity. The numerator on the right-hand side of this equation is the present value of the cash flow occurring at time  $t$  while the denominator is the value of all the bond's payments. These weights sum to 1.0 because the sum of the cash flows discounted at the yield to maturity equals the bond price.


Using these values to calculate the weighted average of the times until the receipt of each of the bond's payments, we obtain Macaulay's duration formula:

$$
D = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} t \times w _ {t} \tag {16.1}
$$

Spreadsheet 16.1 uses Equation 16.1 to find the durations of an  $8\%$  coupon and zero-coupon bond, each with two years to maturity and yield to maturity of  $10\%$ , or  $5\%$  per

# Spreadsheet 16.2

Spreadsheet formulas for calculating duration half-year. The present value of each payment is found by discounting at  $5\%$  per period for the number of (semiannual) periods shown in column B. The weight associated with each payment time (column F) is the present value of the payment (column E) divided by the bond price (the sum of the present values in column E).


The numbers in column G are the products of time to payment and payment weight. Each of these products corresponds to one of the terms in Equation 16.1. According to that equation, we can calculate the duration of each bond by adding the numbers in column G.

The duration of the zero-coupon bond is exactly equal to its time to maturity, two years. This makes sense because with only one payment, the average time until payment must be the bond's maturity. In contrast, the 2-year coupon bond has a shorter duration of 1.8852 years.

Spreadsheet 16.2 shows the spreadsheet formulas used to produce the entries in Spreadsheet 16.1. The inputs in the spreadsheet—specifying the cash flows the bond will pay—are given in columns B–D. In column E we calculate the present value of each cash flow by discounting at the assumed yield to maturity, in column F we calculate the weights for Equation 16.1, and in column G we compute the product of time to payment and payment weight. Each of these terms corresponds to one of the values that is summed in Equation 16.1. The sums computed in cells G8 and G14 are therefore the durations of each bond. Using the spreadsheet, you can easily answer several “what if” questions such as the one in Concept Check 16.1.

# Concept Check 16.1

Suppose the interest rate decreases to  $9\%$  as an annual percentage rate. What will happen to the prices and durations of the two bonds in Spreadsheet 16.1?

Duration is a key concept in fixed-income portfolio management for at least three reasons. First, as we have noted, it is a simple summary statistic of the average maturity of the portfolio. Second, it turns out to be an essential tool in immunizing portfolios from interest rate risk. We explore this application in Section 16.3. Third, duration is a measure of the interest rate sensitivity of a portfolio, which we explore here.

We have seen that a bond's price sensitivity to interest rate changes generally increases with maturity. Duration enables us to quantify this relationship. Specifically, it can be shown that when interest rates change, the proportional change in a bond's price can be related to the change in its yield to maturity,  $y$ , according to the rule

$$
\frac {\Delta P}{P} = - D \times \left[ \frac {\Delta (1 + y)}{1 + y} \right] \tag {16.2}
$$

The proportional price change equals the proportional change in 1 plus the bond's yield times the bond's duration.

Practitioners commonly use Equation 16.2 in a slightly different form. They define modified duration as  $D^{*} = D / (1 + y)$ , note that  $\Delta(1 + y) = \Delta y$ , and rewrite Equation 16.2 as

$$
\frac {\Delta P}{P} = - D ^ {*} \Delta y \tag {16.3}
$$

The percentage change in bond price is just the product of modified duration and the change in the bond's yield to maturity. Therefore, modified duration is a natural measure of the bond's exposure to changes in interest rates.

Actually, as we will see below, Equation 16.2, or equivalently, Equation 16.3, is only approximately valid for large changes in the bond's yield. The approximation becomes exact as one considers smaller, or localized, changes in yields.

# Example 16.1 Duration and Interest Rate Risk

Consider the 2-year-maturity,  $8 \%$ coupon bond in Spreadsheet 16.1 making semiannual coupon payments and selling at a price of \$964.540, for a yield to maturity of  $10 \%$ The duration of this bond is 1.8852 years. For comparison, we will also consider a zero- coupon bond with maturity and duration of 1.8852 years. Because the coupon bond makes payments semiannually, it is best to treat one “period” as a half- year. So the duration of each bond is  $1.8852 \times 2 = 3.7704$  (semiannual) periods, with a per- period interest rate of  $5 \%$ The modified duration of each bond is therefore  $3.7704 / 1.05 = 3.591$  semiannual periods.

Suppose the semiannual interest rate increases from  $5\%$  to  $5.01\%$ . According to Equation 16.3, the bond prices should fall by

$$
\Delta P / P = - D ^ {*} \Delta y = - 3.591 \times .01 \% = -.03591 \%
$$

4 Using calculus, one can show that modified duration is proportional to the derivative of the bond's price with respect to changes in the bond's yield. For small changes in yield, Equation 16.3 can be restated as

$$
D ^ {*} = - \frac {1}{P} \frac {d P}{d y}
$$

As such, it gives a measure of the slope of the bond price curve only in the neighborhood of the current price. In fact, Equation 16.3 can be derived by differentiating the following bond pricing equation with respect to  $y$ :

$$
P = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \frac {\mathrm {C F} _ {t}}{(1 + y) ^ {t}}
$$ where  $\mathrm{CF}_t$  is the cash flow paid to the bondholder at date  $t$ ;  $\mathrm{CF}_t$  represents either a coupon payment before maturity or final coupon plus par value at the maturity date.


Now compute the price change of each bond directly. The coupon bond, which initially sells at  \$964.540, falls to\$ 964.1942 when its yield increases to 5.01\%, which is a percentage decline of .0359\%. The zero-coupon bond initially sells for  $1,000/1.05^{3.7704} = 831.9704$ . At the higher yield, it sells for  $1,000/1.0501^{3.7704} = 831.6717$ . This price also falls by .0359\%.

We conclude that bonds with equal durations do in fact have equal interest rate sensitivity and that (at least for small changes in yields) the percentage price change is the modified duration times the change in yield.

# Concept Check 16.2 a. In Concept Check 16.1, you calculated the price and duration of a 2-year-maturity,  $8\%$  coupon bond making semiannual coupon payments when the market interest rate is  $9\%$ . Now suppose the interest rate increases to  $9.05\%$ . Calculate the new value of the bond and the percentage change in the bond's price.

b. Calculate the percentage change in the bond's price predicted by the duration formula in Equation 16.2 or 16.3. Compare this value to your answer for part (a).

# What Determines Duration?

Malkiel's bond price relations, which we laid out in the previous section, characterize the determinants of interest rate sensitivity. Duration allows us to quantify that sensitivity. For example, if we wish to speculate on interest rates, duration tells us how strong a bet we are making. Conversely, if we wish to remain "neutral" on rates, and simply match the interest rate sensitivity of a chosen bond-market index, duration allows us to measure that sensitivity and mimic it in our own portfolio. For these reasons, it is crucial to understand the determinants of duration. Therefore, we present several "rules" that summarize most of its important properties. These rules are also illustrated in Figure 16.2, where durations of bonds of various coupon rates, yields to maturity, and times to maturity are plotted.

We have already established the following.

Rule 1 for Duration The duration of a zero-coupon bond equals its time to maturity.

We have also seen that a coupon bond has a lower duration than a zero with equal maturity because coupons early in the bond's life lower the bond's weighted average time until payments. This illustrates another general property:

Rule 2 for Duration Holding maturity constant, a bond's duration is lower when the coupon rate is higher.

This property corresponds to Malkiel's fifth relationship and is due to the impact of early coupon payments on the weighted-average maturity of a bond's payments. The higher these coupons, the higher the weights on the early payments and the lower the weighted average maturity of the payments. A lower proportion of the bond's value is attributable to the (earlier) coupon payments, whose values are relatively insensitive to yields, rather than the (later and more yield-sensitive) repayment of par value. Compare the plots in Figure 16.2 of the durations of the  $3\%$  and  $15\%$  coupon bonds with identical yields of  $15\%$ . The plot of the duration of the  $15\%$  coupon bond is uniformly below that of the  $3\%$  coupon bond.

Figure 16.2 Bond duration versus bond maturity


Rule 3 for Duration Holding the coupon rate constant, duration generally increases with its time to maturity. Duration always increases with maturity for bonds selling at par or at a premium to par.

This property of duration corresponds to Malkiel's third relationship, and it is fairly intuitive. What is surprising is that duration need not always increase with time to maturity. It turns out that for some deep-discount bonds (such as the  $3\%$  coupon bond in Figure 16.2), duration may eventually fall with increases in maturity. However, for virtually all traded bonds, it is safe to assume that duration increases with maturity.

Notice in Figure 16.2 that the maturity and duration of the zero-coupon bond are equal. However, for coupon bonds, duration increases by less than a year with a year's increase in maturity.

Figure 16.2 shows that the two  $15\%$  coupon bonds have different durations when they sell at different yields to maturity. The lower-yield bond has longer duration. This makes sense because at lower yields, more distant payments have relatively greater present values and account for a greater share of total value. Thus, in the weighted-average calculation, the distant payments receive greater weights, which results in a higher duration. This establishes rule 4:

Rule 4 for Duration Holding other factors constant, the duration of a coupon bond is higher when the bond's yield to maturity is lower.

As we noted above, the intuition for this property is that while a higher yield reduces the present value of all of the bond's payments, it reduces the value of more-distant payments by a greater proportional amount. Therefore, at higher yields, a higher fraction of the total value of the bond lies in its earlier payments, thereby reducing effective maturity. Rule 4, which is the sixth bond-pricing relationship above, applies to coupon bonds. For zeros, of course, duration equals time to maturity, regardless of the yield to maturity.

Finally, we present a formula for the duration of a perpetuity. This rule is derived from and consistent with the formula for duration given in Equation 16.1 but may be easier to use for infinitely lived bonds.

Rule 5 for Duration The duration of a level perpetuity is

$$
\text {D u r a t i o n} = \frac {1 + y}{y} \tag {16.4}
$$

For example, at a 10\% yield, the duration of a perpetuity that pays \100 once a year forever is 1.10 / .10 = 11 years, but at an 8\% yield it is 1.08 / .08 = 13.5 years.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/0c8a212f8c3eec6ea701ce6521623cf3608c732d0fb9c55439935cab8e70d1c5.jpg)

# Concept Check 16.3

Show that the duration of the perpetuity increases as the interest rate decreases in agreement with rule 4.

The formula for the duration of a perpetuity makes it obvious that maturity and duration can differ substantially. The maturity of the perpetuity is infinite, whereas its duration at a  $10\%$  yield is only 11 years.

Figure 16.2 shows that as their maturities become ever longer, the durations of the two coupon bonds with yields of  $15\%$  both converge to the duration of the perpetuity with the same yield, 7.67 years.

The equations for the durations of coupon bonds are tedious, and spreadsheets like Spreadsheet 16.1 are cumbersome to modify for different maturities and coupon rates. Moreover, they assume that the bond is at the beginning of a coupon payment period. Fortunately, spreadsheet programs such as Excel come with built-in formulas that can accommodate bonds between coupon payment dates. Spreadsheet 16.3, which illustrates how to use Excel to find duration, uses many of the same conventions as the bond-pricing spreadsheets described in Chapter 14.

Bond durations (yield to maturity  $= 8\%$  bond equivalent yield; semiannual coupons)

The settlement date (i.e., today's date) and maturity date are entered in cells B2 and B3 using Excel's date function, DATE(year, month, day). The coupon and maturity rates are entered as decimals in cells B4 and B5, and the payment periods per year are entered in cell B6. Macaulay and modified duration appear in cells B9 and B10. The spreadsheet confirms that the duration of the bond we looked at in Spreadsheet 16.1 is indeed 1.8852 years. For this 2-year-maturity bond, we don't have a specific settlement date. We arbitrarily set the settlement date to January 1, 2000, and use a maturity date precisely two years later.

# Concept Check 16.4

Use Spreadsheet 16.3 to test some of the rules for duration presented a few pages ago. What happens to duration when you change the coupon rate of the bond? The yield to maturity? The maturity? What happens to duration if the bond pays its coupons annually rather than semiannually? Why intuitively is duration shorter with semiannual coupons?

Durations can vary widely among traded bonds. Table 16.3 presents durations computed from Spreadsheet 16.3 for several bonds all paying semiannual coupons and yielding  $4\%$  per half-year. Notice that duration decreases as coupon rates increase, and increases with time to maturity. According to Table 16.3 and Equation 16.2, if the interest rate increases from  $8\%$  to  $8.1\%$ , the  $6\%$  coupon 20-year bond falls in value by about  $10.922 \times .1\% / 1.04 = 1.05\%$ , whereas the  $10\%$  coupon 1-year bond falls by only  $0.976 \times .1\% / 1.04 = 0.094\%$ . Notice also from Table 16.3 that duration is independent of coupon rate only for perpetuities.

# 16.2 Convexity

As a measure of interest rate sensitivity, duration clearly is a key tool in fixed-income portfolio management. Yet the duration rule for the impact of interest rates on bond prices is only an approximation. Equation 16.2, or its equivalent, Equation 16.3, which we repeat here, states that the percentage change in the value of a bond approximately equals the product of modified duration times the change in the bond's yield:

$$
\frac {\Delta P}{P} = - D ^ {*} \Delta y
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/6e74fec372abadb2372274e6bfb6eb676db7f7de26b6310b18d25fa79fbc44e9.jpg)
Figure 16.3 Bond price convexity: 30-year-maturity,  $8\%$  coupon bond; initial yield to maturity  $= 8\%$

In other words, the percentage price change is directly proportional to the change in the bond's yield. If this were exactly so, however, a graph of the percentage change in bond price as a function of the change in its yield would plot as a straight line, with slope equal to  $-D^{*}$ . Yet Figure 16.1 makes it clear that the relationship between bond prices and yields is not linear. The duration rule is a good approximation for small changes in bond yield, but it is less accurate for larger changes.

Figure 16.3 illustrates this point. Like Figure 16.1, the figure presents the percentage change in bond price in response to a change in the bond's yield to maturity. The curved line is the per centage price change for a 30-year-maturity,  $8\%$  annual payment coupon bond, selling at an initial yield to maturity of  $8\%$ . The straight line is the percentage price change predicted by the duration rule. The slope of the straight line is the modified duration of the bond at its initial yield to maturity. The modified duration of the bond at this yield is 11.26 years, so the straight line is a plot of  $-D^{*}\Delta y = -11.26 \times \Delta y$ . The two plots are tangent at the initial yield. Thus, for small changes in the bond's yield to maturity, the duration rule is quite accurate. However, for larger changes, there is progressively more "daylight" between the two plots, demonstrating that the duration rule becomes progressively less accurate.


Figure 16.3 shows that the duration approximation (the straight line) always understates the value of the bond; it underestimates the increase in bond price when the yield falls, and it overestimates the decline in price when the yield rises. This is due to the curvature of the true price-yield relationship. Curves with shapes like that of the price-yield relationship are said to be convex, and the curvature of the price-yield curve is called the convexity of the bond.

We measure convexity as the rate of change of the slope of the price-yield curve, expressed as a fraction of the bond price. The convexity of noncallable bonds such as that

We pointed out in footnote 4 that Equation 16.3 for modified duration can be written as the first derivative (i.e., the slope) of the bond's price with respect to changes in its yield, scaled by the current price:  $D^{*} = 1 / P \times dP / dy$ . Similarly, convexity equals the second derivative (the rate of change of the slope) of the price-yield curve divided by bond price: Convexity  $= 1 / P \times d^{2}P / dy^{2}$ . The formula for the convexity of a bond with a maturity of  $T$  years making annual coupon payments is

$$
\text {C o n v e x i t y} = \frac {1}{P \times (1 + y) ^ {2}} \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \left[ \frac {\mathrm {C F} _ {t}}{(1 + y) ^ {t}} \left(t ^ {2} + t\right) \right]
$$ where  $\mathrm{CF}_t$  is the cash flow paid to the bondholder at date  $t$ ;  $\mathrm{CF}_t$  represents either a coupon payment before maturity or final coupon plus par value at the maturity date.


in Figure 16.3 is positive: The slope increases (i.e., becomes less negative) at higher yields. As a practical matter, you can view bonds with higher convexity as exhibiting higher curvature in the price-yield relationship.

Convexity allows us to improve the duration approximation for bond price changes. Accounting for convexity, Equation 16.3 can be modified as follows:

$$
\frac {\Delta P}{P} = - D ^ {*} \Delta y + 1 / 2 \times \text {C o n v e x i t y} \times (\Delta y) ^ {2} \tag {16.5}
$$

The first term on the right-hand side is the same as the duration rule, Equation 16.3. The second term is the modification for convexity. For a bond with positive convexity, the second term is positive, regardless of whether the yield rises or falls. This insight corresponds to our observation that the duration rule always underestimates the new value of a bond following a change in its yield. Of course, if the change in yield is small, the convexity term, which is multiplied by  $(\Delta y)^2$  in Equation 16.5, will be extremely small and will add little to the duration approximation. Thus, convexity is more important when potential interest rate changes are large.

# Example 16.2 Convexity

The bond in Figure 16.3 has a 30-year maturity and an  $8 \%$ coupon, and sells at an initial yield to maturity of  $8 \%$ Because the coupon rate equals yield to maturity, the bond sells at par value, or \$1,000. The modified duration of the bond at its initial yield is 11.26 years, and its convexity is 212.4, which can be verified using the formula in footnote 7. (You can find a spreadsheet to calculate the convexity of a 30- year bond in Connect or through your course instructor.) If the bond’s yield increases from  $8 \%$ to  $10 \%$ , the bond price will fall to \$811.46, a decline of  $18.85 \%$ . The duration rule, Equation 16.2, would predict a price decline of

$$
\frac {\Delta P}{P} = - D ^ {*} \Delta y = - 11.26 \times .02 = -.2252, \text {or} - 22.52 \%
$$ which is considerably more than the bond price actually falls. The duration-with-convexity rule, Equation 16.4, is far more accurate:


$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\Delta P}{P} = - D ^ {*} \Delta y + \frac {1}{2} \times \text {C o n v e x i t y} (\Delta y) ^ {2} \\ = -11.26 \times .02 + \frac{1}{2} \times 212.4 \times (.02)^{2} = -.1827, \text{or} -18.27\% \\ \end{array}
$$ which is much closer to the actual change in bond price. (Notice that when we use Equation 16.5, we must express interest rates as decimals rather than percentages. The change in rates from  $8\%$  to  $10\%$  is represented as  $\Delta y = .02$ .)


If the change in yield were smaller, say,  $1\%$ , convexity would matter less. The price of the bond actually would fall to \$988.85, a decline of  $1.115\%$ . Without accounting for convexity, we would predict a price decline of

$$
\frac {\Delta P}{P} = - D ^ {*} \Delta y = - 11.26 \times .001 = -.01126, \text {or} - 1.126 \%
$$

Accounting for convexity, we get almost the precisely correct answer:

$$
\frac {\Delta P}{P} = - 11.26 \times .001 + \frac {1}{2} \times 212.4 \times (.001) ^ {2} = -.01115, \text {or} - 1.115 \%
$$

Nevertheless, the duration rule is quite accurate in this case, even without accounting for convexity.

Figure 16.4 Convexity of two bonds

# Why Do Investors Like Convexity?

Convexity is generally considered a desirable trait. Bonds with greater curvature gain more in price when yields fall than they lose when yields rise. For example, in Figure 16.4 bonds  $A$  and  $B$  have the same duration at the initial yield. The plots of their proportional price changes as a function of interest rate changes are tangent, meaning that their sensitivities to changes in yields at that point are equal. However, bond  $A$  is more convex than bond  $B$ . It enjoys greater price increases and smaller price decreases when interest rates fluctuate. If interest rates are volatile, this is an attractive asymme try that increases the expected return on the bond because bond  $A$  will benefit more from rate decreases and suffer less from rate increases. Of course, if convexity is desirable, it will not be available for free: Investors will have to pay higher prices and accept lower yields to maturity on bonds with greater convexity.


# Duration and Convexity of Callable Bonds

Figure 16.5 depicts the price-yield curve for a callable bond. When interest rates are high, the curve is convex, as it would be for a straight bond. For example, at an interest rate of  $10\%$ , the price-yield curve lies above its tangency line. But at low rates, the call price acts as a ceiling on bond value because if the bond ever sold for more than its call price, the issuer would benefit by calling it. In this region, we say that the bond is subject to price compression—its value is "compressed" to the call price. For example, at an interest rate of  $5\%$ , the price-yield curve lies below its tangency line, and the curve is said to have negative convexity.[9]

In the region of negative convexity, the price-yield curve exhibits an unattractive asymmetry. Interest rate increases result in a larger price decline than the price gain corresponding to an interest rate decrease of equal magnitude. The asymmetry arises from the fact that the bond issuer has retained an option to call back the bond. If rates rise, the bondholder loses, as would be the case for a straight bond. But if rates fall, rather than reaping a large capital gain, the investor may have the bond called back. The bondholder is thus in a "heads I lose, tails I don't win" position. Of course, the bondholder was compensated for this unattractive situation when the bond was purchased. Callable bonds sell at lower initial prices (higher initial yields) than otherwise comparable straight bonds.

The effect of negative convexity is highlighted in Equation 16.5. When convexity is negative, the second term on the right-hand side is necessarily negative, meaning that bond price performance will be worse than would be predicted by the duration approximation. However, callable bonds, or, more generally, bonds with "embedded options," are difficult to analyze in terms of Macaulay's duration. This is because in the presence of such options, the future cash flows provided by the bonds are no longer known. If the bond may be called, for example, its cash flow stream may be terminated and its principal repaid earlier than was initially anticipated. Because cash flows are random (they depend on the realization of interest rates), we can hardly take a weighted average of times until each future cash flow, as would be necessary to compute Macaulay's duration.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/0595543a07fb619dc87d418898760cfc4b12c8c07e3e0aedbcf8509cb1d09df6.jpg)
Figure 16.5 Price-yield curve for a callable bond


The convention on Wall Street is to compute the effective duration of bonds with embedded options. Effective duration cannot be computed with a simple formula involving known cash flows such as Equation 16.1. Instead, more complex bond valuation approaches that account for the embedded options are used, and effective duration is defined as the proportional change in the bond price per unit change in market interest rates:

$$
\text {E f f e c t i v e} = - \frac {\Delta P / P}{\Delta r} \tag {16.6}
$$

This equation seems merely like a slight manipulation of the modified duration formula in Equation 16.3. However, there are important differences. First, note that we do not compute effective duration relative to a change in the bond's own yield to maturity. (The denominator is  $\Delta r$ , not  $\Delta y$ .) This is because for bonds with embedded options, which may be called early, maturity is no longer fixed, and so the yield to maturity becomes a less relevant statistic. Instead, we calculate price change relative to a shift in the level of the term structure of interest rates. Second, the effective duration formula relies on a pricing methodology that accounts for embedded options. This means that the effective duration will be a function of variables that would not matter to conventional duration, for example, the volatility of interest rates. In contrast, modified or Macaulay duration can be computed directly from the promised bond cash flows and yield to maturity.

# Example 16.3 Effective Duration

Suppose that a callable bond with a call price of \$1,050 is selling today for \$980. If the yield curve shifts up by .5\%, the bond price will fall to \$930. If it shifts down by .5\%, the bond price will rise to \$1,010. To compute effective duration, we compute

$\Delta r =$  Assumed increase in rates - Assumed decrease in rates

$= .5\% - (-.5\%) = 1\% = .01$

$\Delta P =$  Price at .5\% increase in rates - Price at .5\% decrease in rates

= $930 - $1,010 = -80

Then the effective duration of the bond is

Effective duration  $= -\frac{\Delta P / P}{\Delta r} = -\frac{-\80 / \$ 980}{.01} = 8.16  years

In other words, the bond price changes by  $8.16\%$  for a 1 percentage point swing in rates around current values.

# Duration and Convexity of Mortgage-Backed Securities

In practice, the biggest market for which call provisions are important is the market for mortgage-backed securities. As described in Chapter 1, lenders that originate mortgage loans commonly sell them to federal agencies such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, or Freddie Mac). The original borrowers (the homeowners) continue to make their monthly payments to their lenders, but the lenders pass these payments along to the agency that has purchased the loan. In turn, the agencies may combine many mortgages into a pool called a mortgage-backed security, and then sell that security in the fixed-income market. These securities are called pass-throughs because the cash flows from the borrowers are first passed through to the agency (Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac) and then passed through again to the ultimate purchaser of the mortgage-backed security.

As an example, suppose that ten 30-year mortgages, each with principal value of  \$100,000, are grouped together into a million-dollar pool. If the mortgage rate is 8\%$ , then the monthly payment on each loan would be 733.76. (The interest component of the first payment is .08 × 1/12 × $100,000 = $666.67; the remaining \$67.09 is "amortization," or scheduled repayment of principal. In later periods, with a lower principal balance, less of the monthly payment goes to interest and more goes to amortization.) The owner of the mortgage-backed security would receive \$7,337.60, the total payment from the 10 mortgages in the pool.[10]

But the homeowner has the right to prepay the loan at any time. For example, if mortgage rates go down, the homeowner may decide to take a new loan at a lower rate, using the proceeds to pay off the original loan. The right to prepay the loan is, of course, precisely analogous to the right to refund a callable bond. The call price for the mortgage is simply the remaining principal balance on the loan. Therefore, the mortgage-backed security is best viewed as a pool of callable amortizing loans.


Mortgage-backs are subject to the same negative convexity as other callable bonds. When rates fall and homeowners prepay their mortgages, the repayment of principal is passed through to the investors. Rather than enjoying capital gains on their investment, they simply receive the outstanding principal balance on the loan. Therefore, the value of the mortgage-backed security as a function of interest rates, presented in Figure 16.6, looks much like the plot for a callable bond.

There are some differences between the mortgage-backs and callable corporate bonds, however. For example, you will commonly find mortgage-backs selling for more than their principal balance. This is because homeowners do not refinance their loans as soon as interest rates drop. Some homeowners do not want to incur the costs or hassles of refinancing unless the benefit is great enough, others may decide not to refinance if they are planning to move shortly, and others may simply be unsophisticated in making the refinancing decision. Therefore, while the mortgage-backed security exhibits negative convexity at low rates, its implicit call price (the principal balance on the loan) is not a firm ceiling on its value.

Simple mortgage-backs have also given rise to a rich set of mortgage-backed derivatives. For example, a CMO (collateralized mortgage obligation) further redirects the cash flow stream of the mortgage-backed security to several classes of derivative securities called "tranches." These tranches may be designed to allocate interest rate risk to investors most willing to bear that risk.[11]

Figure 16.6 Price-yield curve for a mortgage-backed security

The following table is an example of a very simple CMO structure. The underlying mortgage pool is divided into three tranches, each with a different effective maturity and therefore interest rate risk exposure. Suppose the original pool has \$10 million of 15-year-maturity mortgages, each with an interest rate of  $10.5\%$ , and is subdivided into three tranches as follows:

<table><tr><td>Tranche A = \$4 million principal</td><td>“Short-pay” tranche</td></tr><tr><td>Tranche B = \$3 million principal</td><td>“Intermediate-pay” tranche</td></tr><tr><td>Tranche C = 3 million principal</td><td>“Long-pay” tranche</td></tr></table>

Suppose further that in each year,  $8\%$  of outstanding loans in the pool prepay. Then total cash flows in each year to the whole mortgage pool are given in Panel A of Figure 16.7.

Figure 16.7 Panel A: Cash flows to whole mortgage pool; Panels B-D: Cash flows to three tranches

Total payments shrink by  $8\%$  each year, as that percentage of the loans in the original pool is paid off. The light portions of each bar represent interest payments, while the dark portions are principal payments, including both loan amortization and prepayments.

In each period, each tranche receives the interest owed it based on the promised coupon rate and outstanding principal balance. But initially, all principal payments, both prepayments and amortization, go to tranche A (Figure 16.7, Panel B). Notice from Panels C and D that tranches B and C receive only interest payments until tranche A is retired. Once tranche A is fully paid off, all principal payments go to tranche B. Finally, when B is retired, all principal payments go to C. This makes tranche A a "short-pay" class, with the lowest effective duration, while tranche C is the longest-pay tranche. This is therefore a relatively simple way to allocate interest rate risk among tranches.

Many variations on the theme are possible and employed in practice. Different tranches may receive different coupon rates. Some tranches may be given preferential treatment in terms of uncertainty over mortgage prepayment speeds. Complex formulas may be used to dictate the cash flows allocated to each tranche. In essence, the mortgage pool is treated as a source of cash flows that can be reallocated to different investors in accordance with their different tastes.

# 16.3 Passive Bond Management

Passive managers take bond prices as fairly set and seek to control only the risk of their fixed-income portfolio. Two broad classes of passive management are pursued in the fixed-income market. The first is an indexing strategy that attempts to replicate the performance of a given bond index. The second is known as immunization, which is used widely by financial institutions such as insurance companies and pension funds to shield overall financial status from exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

Although indexing and immunization strategies are alike in that they accept market prices as correctly set, they are very different in terms of risk exposure. A bond-index portfolio will have the same risk-reward profile as the bond market index to which it is tied. In contrast, immunization strategies seek to establish a virtually zero-risk profile, in which interest rate movements have no impact on the value of the firm. We discuss both strategies in this section.

# Bond-Index Funds

In principle, bond market indexing is similar to stock market indexing. The idea is to create a portfolio that mirrors the composition of an index that measures the broad market. In the U.S. equity market, for example, the S&P 500 is the most commonly used index for stock-index funds, and these funds simply buy shares of each firm in the S&P 500 in proportion to the market value of outstanding equity. A similar strategy is used for bond-index funds, but as we shall see shortly, several modifications are required because of difficulties unique to the bond market and its indexes.

Three major indexes of the U.S. bond market are the Bloomberg Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, the Citigroup U.S. Broad Investment Grade (USBIG) Index, and the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Domestic Master index. All are market-value-weighted indexes of total returns. All three include government, corporate, mortgage-backed, and Yankee bonds in their universes. (Yankee bonds are dollar-denominated, SEC-registered bonds of foreign issuers sold in the United States.)

One challenge in constructing an indexed bond portfolio arises from the fact that these indexes include thousands of securities, making it almost impossible to purchase each security in the index in proportion to its market value. Moreover, many bonds are very thinly traded, meaning that identifying their owners and purchasing the securities at a fair market price can be difficult.

Bond-index funds also face more difficult rebalancing problems than do stock-index funds. Bonds are continually dropped from the index as they approach maturity. Moreover, as new bonds are issued, they are added to the index. Therefore, in contrast to equity indexes, the securities used to compute bond indexes constantly change. As they do, the manager must update or rebalance the portfolio to maintain a close match between the composition of the portfolio and the bonds included in the index. The fact that bonds generate considerable interest income that must be reinvested further complicates the task.

In practice, it is infeasible to precisely replicate the broad bond indexes. Instead, a stratified sampling or cellular approach is often pursued. Figure 16.8 illustrates the idea. First, the bond market is stratified into several subclasses. Figure 16.8 shows a simple two-way breakdown by maturity and issuer; in practice, however, criteria such as the bond's coupon rate or the credit risk of the issuer also would be used to form cells. Bonds falling within each cell are then deemed to be reasonably homogeneous. Next, the percentages of the entire universe (i.e., the bonds included in the relevant index) falling within each cell are computed and reported, as we have done for a few of the cells in Figure 16.8. Finally, the portfolio manager establishes a bond portfolio with representation for each cell that matches the weight of that cell in the bond universe. In this way, the characteristics of the portfolio in terms of maturity, coupon rate, credit risk, industrial representation, and so on will match the characteristics of the index, and the performance of the portfolio likewise should closely match the index.

Both mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that track the broad bond market are available to retail investors. For example, Vanguard's Total Bond Market Index Fund (ticket VBMFX) and Barclays Aggregate Bond Fund iShare (ticket AGG) both track the broad U.S. bond market.

Figure 16.8 Stratification of bonds into cells

With the S&P 500 providing a  $16\%$  rate of return, 2012 was a good year for the stock market, and this performance helped boost the balance sheets of U.S. pension funds. Yet despite the increase in the value of their assets, the total estimated pension deficit of 400 large U.S. companies rose by nearly \$80 billion, and many of these firms entered 2013 needing to shore up their pension funds with billions of dollars of additional cash. Ford Motor Co. alone predicted that it would contribute \$5 billion to its fund.

How could this happen? Blame the decline in interest rates during the year that were in part the force behind the stock market gains. As rates fell, the present value of pension obligations to retirees rose even faster than the value of the assets backing those promises. It turns out that the value of pension liabilities is more sensitive to interest rate changes than the value of the typical assets held in those funds. So even though falling rates tend to pump up asset returns, they pump up liabilities even more. In other words, the duration of fund investments is shorter than the duration of fund obligations. This duration mismatch makes funds vulnerable to interest rate declines.


Why don't funds better match asset and liability durations? One reason is that fund managers are often evaluated based on their performance relative to standard bond market indexes. Those indexes tend to have far shorter durations than pension fund liabilities. So to some extent, managers may be keeping their eyes on the wrong ball, one with the wrong interest rate sensitivity.

# Immunization

In contrast to indexing strategies, many institutions try to insulate their portfolios from interest rate risk altogether. Generally, there are two ways of viewing this risk. Some institutions, such as banks, are concerned with protecting current net worth or net market value against interest rate fluctuations. Others, such as pension funds, may face an obligation to make payments after a given number of years. These investors are more concerned with protecting the future values of their portfolios.

What is common to all investors, however, is interest rate risk. The net worth of the firm or the ability to meet future obligations fluctuates with interest rates. Immunization techniques refer to strategies designed to shield overall financial status from interest rate risk.

Many banks and thrift institutions have a natural mismatch between asset and liability maturities. Bank liabilities are primarily the deposits owed to customers, most of which are short-term and, consequently, have low duration. Bank assets by contrast are composed largely of outstanding commercial and consumer loans or mortgages, which have longer duration. Therefore, when interest rates increase unexpectedly, banks can suffer decreases in net worth—their assets fall in value by more than their liabilities.

Similarly, a pension fund may have a mismatch between the interest rate sensitivities of the assets held in the fund and the present value of its liabilities—the promise to make payments to retirees. The nearby box illustrates the dangers that pension funds face when they neglect to consider the interest rate exposure of both assets and liabilities. For example, in some recent years, pension funds lost ground despite the fact that they enjoyed excellent investment returns. As interest rates fell, the value of their liabilities grew even faster than the value of their assets. The lesson is that funds should match the interest rate exposure of assets and liabilities. In other words, the financial manager might want to immunize the fund against interest rate volatility.

Pension funds are not alone in this concern. Any institution with a future fixed obligation might consider immunization a reasonable risk management policy. Insurance companies, for example, also pursue immunization strategies. In fact, the tactic of immunization was introduced by F. M. Redington, $^{12}$  an actuary for a life insurance company. The idea is that duration-matched assets and liabilities let the asset portfolio meet the firm's obligations despite interest rate movements.


Consider, for example, an insurance company that issues a guaranteed investment contract, or GIC, for  \$10,000. (Essentially, GICs are zero-coupon bonds issued by the insurance company to its customers. They are popular products for individuals' retirement-savings accounts.) If the GIC has a 5-year maturity and a guaranteed interest rate of 8\%$ , the insurance company promises to pay 10,000  $\times$  1.08 $^5$  = 14,693.28 in five years.

Suppose that the insurance company chooses to fund its obligation with 10,000 of 8\% annual coupon bonds, selling at par value, with six years to maturity. As long as the market interest rate stays at 8\%, the company has fully funded the obligation, as the present value of the obligation exactly equals the value of the bonds.

Table 16.4, Panel A, shows that if interest rates remain at  $8\%$ , the accumulated funds from the bond will grow to exactly the 14,693.28 obligation. Over the 5-year period, each

<table><tr><td>Payment Number</td><td>Years Remaining until Obligation</td><td>Accumulated Value of Invested Payment</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">A.

# Table 16.4

Terminal value of a 6-year-maturity bond portfolio after five years (all proceeds reinvested) year-end coupon payment of 800 is reinvested at the prevailing 8 \%market interest rate. At the end of the period, the bonds can be sold for \$ 10,000; they still will sell at par value because the coupon rate still equals the market interest rate. Total income after five years from reinvested coupons and the sale of the bond is precisely \$ 14,693.28.

Note: The sale price of the 6-year-maturity bond portfolio equals the portfolio's final payment (10,800) divided by 1 + r because the time to maturity of the bonds will be one year at the time of sale.


If interest rates change, however, two offsetting influences will affect the ability of the fund to grow to the targeted value of 14,693.28. If rates rise, the fund will suffer a capital loss, impairing its ability to satisfy the obligation. However, at that higher interest rate, reinvested coupons will grow at a faster rate, offsetting the capital loss. In other words, fixed-income investors face two offsetting types of interest rate risk: price risk and reinvestment rate risk. Increases in interest rates cause capital losses but at the same time increase the rate at which reinvested income will grow. If the portfolio duration is chosen appropriately, these two effects will cancel out exactly. When the portfolio duration equals the investor's horizon date, the accumulated value of the investment fund at the horizon date will be unaffected by interest rate fluctuations. For a horizon equal to the portfolio's duration, price risk and reinvestment risk are precisely offsetting.

In our example, the duration of the 6-year-maturity bonds used to fund the GIC is almost exactly five years. Because the assets and liabilities have equal durations, the insurance company is immunized against interest rate fluctuations. To confirm this, let's check that the bond can generate enough income to pay off the obligation in five years regardless of interest rate movements.

Panels B and C of Table 16.4 illustrate two possible interest rate scenarios: Rates either fall to  $7\%$  (Panel B) or increase to  $9\%$  (Panel C). In both cases, the annual coupon payments are reinvested at the new interest rate, which is assumed to change before the first coupon payment, and the bond is sold in year 5 to help satisfy the obligation of the GIC.

Panel B shows that if interest rates fall to  $7\%$ , the total funds will accumulate to \$14,694.05, providing a small surplus of \$  .77. If rates increase to  $9\%$  as in Panel C, the fund accumulates to \$14,696.02, providing a small surplus of \$  2.74.

Several points are worth highlighting. First, duration matching balances the difference between the accumulated value of the coupon payments (reinvestment rate risk) and the sale value of the bond (price risk). That is, when interest rates fall, the coupons grow less than in the base case, but the higher value of the bond offsets this. When interest rates rise, the value of the bond falls, but the coupons more than make up for this loss because they are reinvested at the higher rate. Figure 16.9 illustrates this case. The solid

Connect contains a spreadsheet that is useful in understanding the concept of holding-period immunization. The spreadsheet calculates duration and holding-period returns on bonds of any maturity. The spreadsheet shows how price risk and reinvestment risk offset if a bond is sold at its duration.

The dashed curve shows that value if interest rates happen to increase. The initial impact is a capital loss, but this loss eventually is offset by the now-faster growth rate of reinvested funds. At the 5-year horizon date, equal to the bond's duration, the two effects just cancel, leaving the company able to satisfy its obligation with the accumulated proceeds from the bond.


We can also analyze immunization in terms of present as opposed to future values. Panel A in Table 16.5 shows the initial balance sheet for the insurance company's GIC.

# Table 16.5

Market value balance sheet

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">A.

Interest Rate = 7\%</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Bonds</td><td>$10,476.65</td><td>Obligation</td><td>$10,476.11</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">C.

Notes: Value of bonds  $= 800\times$  Annuity factor(r, 6)  $+10,000\times$  PV factor(r, 6) Value of obligation  $= \frac{14,693.28}{(1 + n)^{5}} = 14,693.28\times$  PV factor(r, 5)

Both assets and the obligation have market values of 10,000, so the plan is just fully funded. Panels B and C show that whether the interest rate increases or decreases, the value of the bonds funding the GIC and the present value of the company's obligation change by virtually identical amounts. In either case, the plan remains fully funded, with the surplus in Panels B and C in Table 16.5 just about zero.

Figure 16.10 is a graph of the present values of the bond and the single-payment obligation as a function of the interest rate. At the current rate of  $8\%$ , the values are equal, and the obligation is fully funded by the bond. Moreover, the two present value curves are tangent at  $y = 8\%$ . As interest rates change, the change in value of both the asset and the obligation is equal, so the obligation remains fully funded. For greater changes in the interest rate, however, the present value curves diverge. This reflects the fact that the fund actually shows a small surplus in Table 16.4 at market interest rates other than  $8\%$ .

If the obligation was immunized, why is there any surplus in the fund? The answer is convexity. Figure 16.10 shows that the coupon bond has greater convexity than the obligation it funds. Hence, when rates move substantially, the bond value exceeds the present value of the obligation by a noticeable amount.

This example highlights the importance of rebalancing immunized portfolios. As interest rates and asset durations change, a manager must rebalance the portfolio to realign its duration with the duration of the obligation. Moreover, even if interest rates do not change, asset durations will change solely because of the passage of time. Recall from Figure 16.2 that duration generally decreases less rapidly than maturity. Thus, even if an obligation is immunized at the outset, as time passes, the durations of the asset and liability will fall at different rates. Without rebalancing, durations will become unmatched.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/1c8ac953086385799ff1f41caca8404695c2f9df86943bb7a5de19b2555525e6.jpg)
Figure 16.10 Immunization. The coupon bond fully funds the obligation at an interest rate of  $8\%$ . Moreover, the present value curves are tangent at  $8\%$ , so the obligation will remain fully funded even if rates change by a small amount.

Obviously, immunization is a passive strategy only in the sense that it does not involve attempts to identify undervalued securities. Immunization managers must still proactively update and monitor their positions.

# Example 16.4 Constructing an Immunized Portfolio

An insurance company must make a payment of  \$19,487 in seven years. The market interest rate is 10\%$ , so the present value of the obligation is 10,000. The company's portfolio manager wishes to fund the obligation using 3-year zero-coupon bonds and perpetuities paying annual coupons. (We focus on zeros and perpetuities to keep the algebra simple.) How can the manager immunize the obligation?

Immunization requires that the duration of the portfolio of assets equal the duration of the liability. We can proceed in four steps:

1. Calculate the duration of the liability, which, in this case, is simple to compute. It is a single-payment obligation with duration of seven years.
2. Calculate the duration of the asset portfolio, which is the weighted average of duration of each component asset, with weights proportional to the funds placed in each asset. The duration of the zero-coupon bond is its maturity, three years.

The duration of the perpetuity is  $1.10 / .10 = 11$  years. Therefore, if the fraction of the portfolio invested in the zero is called  $w$  and the fraction invested in the perpetuity is  $(1 - w)$ , the portfolio duration is

\text {A s s e t d u r a t i o n} = w \times 3 \text {y e a r s} + (1 - w) \times 1 1 \text {y e a r s}
$$

3. Find the asset mix that sets the duration of assets equal to the 7-year duration of liabilities. This requires us to solve for  $w$  in the following equation:

$$ w \times 3 \mathrm {y e a r s} + (1 - w) \times 1 1 \mathrm {y e a r s} = 7 \mathrm {y e a r s}
$$

This implies that  $w = \frac{1}{2}$ . The manager should invest half the portfolio in the zero and half in the perpetuity. This will result in an asset duration of seven years.

4. Fully fund the obligation. Because the obligation has a present value of \$10,000, and the fund will be invested equally in the zero and the perpetuity, the manager must purchase \$5,000 of the zero-coupon bond and \$5,000 of the perpetuity. (The face value of the zero will be \$5,000 × 1.10³ = 6,655.)

Even if a position is immunized, however, the portfolio manager still cannot rest. This is because of the need to rebalance as interest rates fluctuate. Moreover, even if rates do not change, the passage of time also will affect duration and require rebalancing. Let's continue Example 16.4 and see how the portfolio manager can maintain an immunized position.

# Example 16.5 Rebalancing

Suppose that a year has passed, and the interest rate remains at  $10\%$ . The portfolio manager of Example 16.4 needs to reexamine the position. Is it still fully funded? Is it still immunized? If not, what actions are required?

First, examine funding. The present value of the obligation has grown to \$11,000, as it is one year closer to maturity. The manager's funds also have grown to \$11,000: The zero-coupon bonds have increased in value from $5,000 to $5,500 with the passage of time, while the perpetuity has paid its annual \$500 coupon and remains worth \$5,000. Therefore, the obligation is still fully funded.

The portfolio weights must be changed, however. The zero-coupon bond now has a duration of two years, while the perpetuity's duration remains at 11 years. The obligation is now due in six years. The weights must now satisfy the equation

$$ w \times 2 + (1 - w) \times 1 1 = 6
$$ which implies that  $w = 5 \frac{1}{2}$ . To rebalance the portfolio and maintain the duration match, the manager now must invest a total of  $\ {11},{000} \times  {5\frac{1}{2}} = \$  {6,111.11}  in the zero-coupon bond. This requires that the entire  $\$ {500}$  coupon payment be invested in the zero, with an additional  $\$ {111.11}$  of the perpetuity sold and invested in the zero-coupon bond.


Of course, rebalancing entails transaction costs. In practice, an appropriate compromise must be established between the desire for perfect immunization, which requires continual rebalancing, and the need to control trading costs, which dictates less frequent rebalancing.

# Concept Check 16.6

Look again at Example 16.5. What would be the immunizing weights in the second year if the interest rate had fallen to  $8\%$ ?

# Cash Flow Matching and Dedication

The problems associated with immunization appear to have a simple solution. Why not simply buy a zero-coupon bond with face value equal to the projected cash outlay? If we follow the principle of cash flow matching, we automatically immunize the portfolio from interest rate risk because the cash flows from the bond and the obligation exactly offset each other.

Cash flow matching on a multiperiod basis is referred to as a dedication strategy. In this case, the manager selects either zero-coupon or coupon bonds with total cash flows in each period that match a series of obligations. The advantage of dedication is that it is a once-and-for-all approach to eliminating interest rate risk. Once the cash flows are matched, there is no need for rebalancing.

Cash flow matching is not more widely pursued probably because of the constraints that it imposes on bond selection. Immunization or dedication strategies are appealing to firms that do not wish to bet on general movements in interest rates, but these firms may want to immunize using bonds that they perceive are undervalued. Cash flow matching, however, places so many constraints on the bond selection process that it can be impossible to pursue a dedication strategy using only "underpriced" bonds. Firms looking for underpriced bonds give up exact and easy dedication for the possibility of achieving superior returns from the bond portfolio.

Sometimes, cash flow matching is simply not possible. For example, a pension fund that wishes to cash flow match a perpetual flow of benefits paid to current and future retirees would need to purchase fixed-income securities with maturities ranging up to hundreds of years. Such securities do not exist, making exact dedication infeasible.

# Concept Check 16.7

How would an increase in trading costs affect the attractiveness of dedication versus immunization?

# Other Problems with Conventional Immunization

If you look back at the definition of duration in Equation 16.1, you will see that it uses the bond's yield to maturity to calculate the weight applied to the time until each coupon payment. Given this definition and limitations on the proper use of yield to maturity, it is perhaps not surprising that this notion of duration is strictly valid only for a flat yield curve for which all payments are discounted at a common interest rate.

If the yield curve is not flat, then the definition of duration must be modified and  $\mathrm{CF}_t / (1 + y)^t$  replaced with the present value of  $\mathrm{CF}_t$ , where the present value of each cash flow is calculated by discounting with the appropriate spot interest rate from the zero-coupon yield curve corresponding to the date of the particular cash flow, instead of by discounting with the bond's yield to maturity. Moreover, even with this modification, duration matching will immunize portfolios only for parallel shifts in the yield curve. Clearly, this sort of restriction is unrealistic. As a result, much work has been devoted to generalizing the notion of duration. Multifactor duration models have been developed to allow for tilts and other distortions in the shape of the yield curve, in addition to shifts in its level. However, the added complexity of such models does not appear to pay off in terms of substantially greater effectiveness.[13]

Finally, immunization can be an inappropriate goal in an inflationary environment. Immunization is essentially a nominal notion and makes sense only for nominal liabilities. It makes no sense to immunize a projected obligation that will grow with the price level using nominal assets such as bonds. For example, if your child will attend college in 15 years and if the annual cost of tuition is expected to be  \$50,000 at that time, immunizing your portfolio at a locked-in terminal value of\$ 50,000 is not necessarily a risk-reducing strategy. The tuition obligation will vary with the realized inflation rate, whereas the asset portfolio's final value will not. As a result, the tuition obligation will not be matched by the value of the portfolio.

# 16.4 Active Bond Management

# Sources of Potential Profit

Broadly speaking, there are two sources of potential value in active bond management. The first is interest rate forecasting, which tries to anticipate movements across the entire spectrum of the fixed-income market. If interest rate declines are anticipated, managers will increase portfolio duration (and vice versa). The second source of potential profit is identification of relative mispricing within the fixed-income market. For example, you might believe that the default premium on one particular bond is unnecessarily large and therefore that the bond is underpriced.


These techniques will generate abnormal returns only if your information or insight is superior to that of the market. You cannot profit from knowledge that rates are about to fall if prices already reflect this information. You know this from our discussion of market efficiency. Valuable information is differential information. In this context it is worth noting that interest rate forecasters have a notoriously poor track record. If you consider this record, you will approach attempts to time the bond market with caution.

Homer and Liebowitz (see footnote 2) coined a popular taxonomy of active bond portfolio strategies. They characterize portfolio rebalancing activities as one of four types of bond swaps. In the first two swaps, the investor typically believes that the yield relationship between particular bonds or sectors is only temporarily out of alignment. When the aberration is eliminated, gains can be realized on the underpriced bond. The period of realignment is called the workout period.

1. The substitution swap is an exchange of one bond for a nearly identical substitute. The substituted bonds should be of essentially equal coupon, maturity, quality, call features, sinking fund provisions, and so on. This swap would be motivated by a belief that the market has temporarily mispriced the two bonds, and that the discrepancy between the prices of the bonds represents a profit opportunity.

An example of a substitution swap would be a sale of a 20-year-maturity,  $6\%$  coupon Toyota bond that is priced to provide a yield to maturity of  $6.05\%$ , coupled with a purchase of a  $6\%$  coupon Honda bond with the same time to maturity that yields  $6.15\%$ . If the bonds have about the same credit rating, there is no apparent reason for the Honda bonds to provide a higher yield. Therefore, the higher yield actually available in the market makes the Honda bond seem relatively attractive. Of course, the equality of credit risk is an important condition. If the Honda bond is in fact riskier, then its higher yield does not represent a bargain.

2. The intermarket spread swap is pursued when an investor believes that the yield spread between two sectors of the bond market is temporarily out of line. For example, if the current spread between corporate and government bonds is expected to narrow, the investor will shift from government bonds into corporate bonds. If the yield spread does in fact narrow, corporates will outperform governments. For example, if the yield spread between 10-year Treasury bonds and 10-year Baa-rated corporate bonds is now  $3\%$ , and the historical spread has been only  $2\%$ , you might consider selling holdings of Treasury bonds and replacing them with corporates.

Of course, you need to consider carefully whether there is a good reason that the yield spread seems out of alignment. Perhaps the default premium on corporate bonds increased because the market expects a recession. In this case, the wider spread would not represent attractive pricing of corporates relative to Treasuries, but would simply be an adjustment for a perceived increase in credit risk.

3. The rate anticipation swap is pegged to interest rate forecasting. If investors believe that rates will fall, they will swap into bonds of longer duration. For example, the investor might sell a 5-year-maturity Treasury bond, replacing it with a 25-year-maturity Treasury bond. The new bond has the same lack of credit risk as the old one, but it has longer duration. Conversely, when rates are expected to rise, investors will swap into shorter-duration bonds.
4. The pure yield pickup swap is pursued not in response to perceived mispricing, but as a means of increasing return by holding higher-yield bonds. When the yield curve is upward-sloping, the yield pickup swap entails moving into longer-term bonds. This strategy must be viewed as an attempt to earn an expected term premium in higher-yield bonds and comes at the price of increased interest rate risk. If the yield curve shifts up during the holding period, the longer-duration bond will suffer a greater capital loss.


We can add a fifth swap, called a tax swap, to this list. This simply refers to a swap to exploit some tax advantage. For example, an investor may swap from one bond that has decreased in price to another if realization of capital losses is advantageous for tax purposes.

# Horizon Analysis

One form of interest rate forecasting, which we encountered in Chapter 14, is called horizon analysis. The analyst selects a particular holding period and predicts the yield curve at the end of that period. Given a bond's time to maturity at the end of the holding period, its yield can be read from the predicted yield curve and its end-of-period price calculated. Then the analyst adds the coupon income and prospective capital gain of the bond to find the total return over the holding period.

# Example 16.6 Horizon Analysis

A 20-year-maturity bond with a  $10\%$  coupon rate (paid annually) currently sells at a yield to maturity of  $9\%$ . A portfolio manager with a 2-year horizon needs to forecast the total return on the bond over the coming two years. In two years, the bond will have an 18-year maturity. The analyst forecasts that two years from now, 18-year bonds will sell at yields to maturity of  $8\%$ , and that coupon payments can be reinvested in short-term securities over the coming two years at a rate of  $7\%$ .

To calculate the 2-year return on the bond, the analyst would perform the following calculations:

1. Current price = \ 100 \times \text{Annuity factor}(9\%, 20 \text{ years})

$$
\begin{array}{l} + \$ 1,000 \times PV \text {factor} (9\%, 20 \text {years}) \\ = \$ 1,091.29 \\ \end{array}
$$

2. Forecast price = \ 100 \times \text{Annuity factor}(8\%, 18 \text{ years})

$$
\begin{array}{l} + \$ 1,000 \times PV \text {factor} (8\%, 18 \text {years}) \\ = \$ 1,187.44 \\ \end{array}
$$

3. The future value of reinvested coupons = ($100 × 1.07) + $100 = 207
4. The 2-year return  $= \frac{\$ 207 + (\$ 1,187.44 - \$ 1,091.29)}{\$ 1,091.29} = 0.278$ , or  $27.8\%$

The annualized rate of return over the 2-year period would then be  $1.278^{1/2} - 1 = 0.13$ , or  $13\%$ .

# Concept Check 16.8

What will be the rate of return in Example 16.6 if the manager forecasts that in two years the yield on 18-year bonds will be  $10\%$  and the reinvestment rate for coupons will be  $8\%$ ?

1. Even default-free bonds such as Treasury issues are subject to interest rate risk. Longer-term bonds generally are more sensitive to interest rate shifts than are short-term bonds. Macaulay's duration measures the average life of a bond. Duration is defined as the weighted average of the times until each payment made by the security, with weights proportional to the present value of the payment.
2. Duration is a direct measure of the sensitivity of a bond's price to a change in its yield. The proportional change in a bond's price equals the negative of duration multiplied by the proportional change in  $1 + y$ .
3. Convexity refers to the curvature of a bond's price-yield relationship. Accounting for convexity can substantially improve the accuracy of the duration approximation for the response of bond prices to changes in yields.
4. Immunization is an important category of passive bond portfolio management. It attempts to render the individual or firm immune from movements in interest rates. This may take the form of immunizing net worth or, instead, immunizing the future accumulated value of a fixed-income portfolio.
5. Immunization of a fully funded plan is accomplished by matching the durations of assets and liabilities. To maintain an immunized position as time passes and interest rates change, the portfolio must be periodically rebalanced.
6. A more direct form of immunization is dedication, or cash-flow matching. If portfolio cash flows are perfectly matched to those of projected liabilities, rebalancing will be unnecessary. But dedication imposes a large number of constraints on bond choice, and in many cases may not be feasible.
7. Active bond management consists of interest rate forecasting techniques and intermarket spread analysis. One popular taxonomy classifies active strategies as substitution swaps, intermarket spread swaps, rate anticipation swaps, and pure yield pickup swaps.
8. Horizon analysis is a type of interest rate forecasting. In this procedure, the analyst forecasts the position of the yield curve at the end of some holding period and from that yield curve predicts corresponding bond prices. Bonds then can be ranked according to expected total rates of return over the holding period.

Spice asks Meyers about how a fixed-income manager would position his portfolio to capitalize on expectations of increasing interest rates. Which of the following would be the most appropriate strategy?

a. Shorten his portfolio duration.
$b$ . Buy fixed-rate bonds.
c. Lengthen his portfolio duration.

18. Spice asks Meyers (see Problem 17) to quantify price changes from changes in interest rates. To illustrate, Meyers computes the value change for the fixed-rate note in the table. Specifically, he assumes an increase in the level of interest rate of 100 basis points. Using the information in the table, what is the predicted change in the price of the fixed-rate note?

19. Find the duration of a bond with a settlement date of May 27, 2025, and maturity date November 15, 2036. The coupon rate of the bond is  $7\%$ , and the bond pays coupons semiannually. The bond is selling at a bond-equivalent yield to maturity of  $8\%$ . You can use Spreadsheet 16.3, available in Connect or through your course instructor.

20. A 30-year-maturity bond has a 7\% coupon rate, paid annually. It sells today for \$867.42. A 20-year-maturity bond has a 6.5\% coupon rate, also paid annually. It sells today for \$879.50. A bond market analyst forecasts that in five years, 25-year-maturity bonds will sell at yields to maturity of 8\% and 15-year-maturity bonds will sell at yields of 7.5\%. Because the yield curve is upward-sloping, the analyst believes that coupons will be invested in short-term securities at a rate of 6\%.

$a$ . Calculate the (annualized) expected rate of return of the 30-year bond over the 5-year period.
$b$ . What is the (annualized) expected return of the 20-year bond?

21. a. Use a spreadsheet to calculate the durations of the two bonds in Spreadsheet 16.1 if the market interest rate increases to  $12\%$ . Why does the duration of the coupon bond fall while that of the zero remains unchanged? (Hint: Examine what happens to the weights computed in column F.)

$b$ . Use the same spreadsheet to calculate the duration of the coupon bond if the coupon is  $12\%$  instead of  $8\%$  and the semiannual interest rate is again  $5\%$ . Explain why duration is lower than in Spreadsheet 16.1. (Again, start by looking at column F.)

22. a. Footnote 7 presents the formula for the convexity of a bond. Build a spreadsheet to calculate the convexity of a 5-year,  $8\%$  coupon bond making annual payments at the initial yield to maturity of  $10\%$ .

$b$ . What is the convexity of a 5-year zero-coupon bond?

23. A 12.75-year-maturity zero-coupon bond selling at a yield to maturity of  $8\%$  (effective annual yield) has convexity of 150.3 and modified duration of 11.81 years. A 30-year-maturity  $6\%$  coupon bond making annual coupon payments also selling at a yield to maturity of  $8\%$  has nearly identical duration—11.79 years—but considerably higher convexity of 231.2.

a. Suppose the yield to maturity on both bonds increases to  $9\%$ . (i) What will be the actual percentage capital loss on each bond? (ii) What percentage capital loss would be predicted by the duration-with-convexity rule?
b. Repeat part (a), but this time assume the yield to maturity decreases to  $7\%$ .
c. Compare the performance of the two bonds in the two scenarios, one involving an increase in rates, the other a decrease. Based on the comparative investment performance, explain the attraction of convexity.
d. In view of your answer to part (c), do you think it would be possible for two bonds with equal duration but different convexity to be priced initially at the same yield to maturity if the yields on both bonds always increased or decreased by equal amounts, as in this example? (Hint: Would anyone be willing to buy the bond with lower convexity under these circumstances?)

24. A newly issued bond has a maturity of 10 years and pays a  $7\%$  coupon rate (with coupon payments coming once annually). The bond sells at par value.

a. What are the convexity and the duration of the bond? Use the formula for convexity in footnote 7.
$b$ . Find the actual price of the bond assuming that its yield to maturity immediately increases from  $7\%$  to  $8\%$  (with maturity still 10 years).
c. What price would be predicted by the modified duration rule (Equation 16.3)? What is the percentage error of that rule?
d. What price would be predicted by the modified duration-with-convexity rule (Equation 16.5)? What is the percentage error of that rule?

25. a. Use a spreadsheet to answer this question and assume the yield curve is flat at a level of  $4\%$ . Calculate the convexity of a "bullet" fixed-income portfolio, that is, a portfolio with a single cash flow. Suppose a single 1,000 cash flow is paid in year 5.

b. Now calculate the convexity of a "ladder" fixed-income portfolio, that is, a portfolio with equal cash flows over time. Suppose the security makes 100 cash flows in each of years 1–9, so that its duration is close to the bullet in part (a).
c. Do ladders or bullets have greater convexity?

$a$ . Calculate the modified duration of each of the following: i. The  $4.75\%$  Treasury security due 2050.

ii. The total bond portfolio.

b. VanHusen remarks to Kapple, "If you changed the maturity structure of the bond portfolio to result in a portfolio duration of 5.25 years, the price sensitivity of the portfolio would be identical to that of a single, noncallable Treasury security that also has a duration of 5.25 years." In what circumstance would VanHusen's remark be correct?

6. One common goal among fixed-income portfolio managers is to earn high incremental returns on corporate bonds versus government bonds of comparable durations. The approach of some corporate-bond portfolio managers is to find and purchase those corporate bonds having the largest initial spreads over comparable-duration government bonds. John Ames, HFS's fixed-income manager, believes that a more rigorous approach is required.

The following table presents data relating to one set of corporate/government spread relationships at a given date:

<table><tr><td>Bond Rating</td><td>Initial Spread over Governments</td><td>Expected Horizon Spread</td><td>Initial Duration</td><td>Expected Duration 1 Year from Now</td></tr><tr><td>Aaa</td><td>31 b.p.</td><td>31 b.p.</td><td>4 years</td><td>3.1 years</td></tr><tr><td>Aa</td><td>40 b.p.</td><td>50 b.p.</td><td>4 years</td><td>3.1 years</td></tr></table> a. Recommend purchase of either Aaa or Aa bonds for a 1-year investment horizon given a goal of maximizing expected returns.

Note: 1 b.p. = 1 basis point, or .01\%.

b. Ames chooses not to rely solely on initial spread relationships. His analytical framework considers a full range of other key variables likely to impact realized returns, including call provisions and potential changes in interest rates. Describe variables, in addition to those identified above, that Ames should include in his analysis and explain how each of these could cause realized incremental returns to differ from those indicated by initial spread relationships.

7. Patrick Wall is considering the purchase of one of the two bonds described in the following table. Wall realizes his decision will depend primarily on effective duration, and he believes that interest rates will decline by 50 basis points at all maturities over the next six months.

<table><tr><td>Characteristic</td><td>CIC</td><td>PTR</td></tr><tr><td>Market price</td><td>101.75</td><td>101.75</td></tr><tr><td>Maturity date</td><td>June 1, 2035</td><td>June 1, 2035</td></tr><tr><td>Call date</td><td>Noncallable</td><td>June 1, 2030</td></tr><tr><td>Annual coupon</td><td>5.25\%</td><td>6.35\%</td></tr><tr><td>Interest payment</td><td>Semiannual</td><td>Semiannual</td></tr><tr><td>Effective duration</td><td>7.35</td><td>5.40</td></tr><tr><td>Yield to maturity</td><td>5.02\%</td><td>6.10\%</td></tr><tr><td>Credit rating</td><td>A</td><td>A</td></tr></table> a. Calculate the percentage price change forecasted by effective duration for both the CIC and PTR bonds if interest rates decline by 50 basis points over the next six months.

b. Calculate the 6-month horizon return (in percent) for each bond if the CIC bond price at the end of six months equals 105.55 and the PTR bond price equals 104.15.
c. Wall is surprised by the fact that although interest rates fell by 50 basis points, the actual price change for the CIC bond was greater than the price change forecasted by effective duration, whereas the actual price change for the PTR bond was less than the price change forecasted by effective duration. Explain why the actual price change would be greater for the CIC bond and less for the PTR bond.

8. You are the manager for the bond portfolio of a pension fund. The policies of the fund allow for the use of active strategies in managing the bond portfolio.

It appears that the economic cycle is beginning to mature, inflation is expected to accelerate, and in an effort to contain the economic expansion, the central bank is moving toward tighter monetary policy. For each of the situations below, state which one of the two bonds you would prefer. Briefly justify your answer in each case.

9. A member of a firm's investment committee is very interested in learning about the management of fixed-income portfolios. He would like to know how fixed-income managers position portfolios to capitalize on their expectations concerning three factors that influence interest rates:

$a$ . Changes in the level of interest rates.
$b$ . Changes in yield spreads across/between sectors.
$c$ . Changes in yield spreads as to a particular instrument.

Formulate and describe a fixed-income portfolio management strategy for each of these factors that could be used to exploit a portfolio manager's expectations about that factor. (Note: Three strategies are required, one for each of the listed factors.)

10. Carol Harrod is the investment officer for a 100 million U.S. pension fund. The fixed-income portion of the portfolio is actively managed, and a substantial portion of the fund's large capitalization U.S. equity portfolio is indexed and managed by Webb Street Advisors.

Harrod has been impressed with the investment results of Webb Street's equity index strategy and is considering asking Webb Street to index a portion of the actively managed fixed-income portfolio.

a. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of bond indexing relative to active bond management.
b. Webb Street manages indexed bond portfolios. Discuss how an indexed bond portfolio is constructed under stratified sampling (cellular) methods.
$c$ . Describe the main source of tracking error for the cellular method.

11. Janet Meer is a fixed-income portfolio manager. Noting that the current shape of the yield curve is flat, she considers the purchase of a newly issued,  $7\%$  coupon, 10-year-maturity, option-free corporate bond priced at par. The bond has the following features:

Change in Yields

<table><tr><td></td><td>Up 10 Basis Points</td><td>Down 10 Basis Points</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>99.29</td><td>100.71</td></tr><tr><td>Convexity measure</td><td colspan="2">35.00</td></tr><tr><td>Convexity adjustment</td><td colspan="2">0.0035</td></tr></table>

$a$ . Calculate the modified duration of the bond.
b. Meer is also considering the purchase of a newly issued,  $7.25\%$  coupon, 12-year-maturity option-free corporate bond. She wants to evaluate this second bond's price sensitivity to a decline in interest rates. Using the following data, estimate the bond's percentage price change if the yield curve shifts downward by 200 basis points.

<table><tr><td>Original issue price</td><td>Par value, to yield 7.25\%</td></tr><tr><td>Modified duration (at original price)</td><td>7.90</td></tr><tr><td>Convexity measure</td><td>41.55</td></tr><tr><td>Convexity adjustment (for a yield change of 200 basis points)</td><td>1.66</td></tr></table> c. Meer asks her assistant to analyze several callable bonds, given the expected downward parallel shift in the yield curve. Meer's assistant argues that if interest rates fall enough, convexity for a callable bond will become negative. Is the assistant's argument correct?


12. Noah Kramer, a fixed-income portfolio manager based in the country of Sevista, is considering the purchase of a Sevista government bond. Kramer decides to evaluate two strategies for implementing his investment in Sevista bonds. Table 16A gives the details of the two strategies, and Table 16B contains the assumptions that apply to both strategies.

<table><tr><td>Strategy</td><td>5-Year Maturity
(Modified
Duration = 4.83)</td><td>15-Year Maturity

Before choosing one of the two bond-investment strategies, Kramer wants to analyze how the market value of the bonds will change if an instantaneous interest rate shift occurs immediately after his investment. The details of the shift in the yield curve are shown in Table 16C. Calculate for each scenario the percent change in the market value of both Strategies I and II.

<table><tr><td>Maturity</td><td>Interest Rate Change</td></tr><tr><td>5 year</td><td>Down 75 basis points (bps)</td></tr><tr><td>15 year</td><td>Up 25 bps</td></tr><tr><td>25 year</td><td>Up 50 bps</td></tr></table>

Instantaneous interest rate shift immediately after investment

13. As part of your analysis of debt issued by Monticello Corporation, you are asked to evaluate two of its bond issues, shown in the following table.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Bond A (Callable)</td><td>Bond B (Noncallable)</td></tr><tr><td>Maturity</td><td>2030</td><td>2030</td></tr><tr><td>Coupon</td><td>11.50\%</td><td>7.25\%</td></tr><tr><td>Current price</td><td>125.75</td><td>100.00</td></tr><tr><td>Yield to maturity</td><td>7.70\%</td><td>7.25\%</td></tr><tr><td>Modified duration to maturity</td><td>6.20</td><td>6.80</td></tr><tr><td>Call date</td><td>2024</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Call price</td><td>105</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Yield to call</td><td>5.10\%</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Modified duration to call</td><td>3.10</td><td>—</td></tr></table>

$a$ . Using the duration and yield information in the table above, compare the price and yield behavior of the two bonds under each of the following two scenarios: i. Strong economic recovery with rising inflation expectations.

ii. Economic recession with reduced inflation expectations.

$b$ . Using the information in the table, calculate the projected price change for bond  $B$  if its yield to maturity falls by 75 basis points.
c. Describe the shortcoming of analyzing bond  $A$  strictly to call or to maturity.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. Use Spreadsheet 16.1 with a semiannual discount rate of  $4.5\%$ .

<table><tr><td></td><td>Period</td><td>Time until Payment (Years)</td><td>Cash Flow</td><td>PV of CF (Discount rate = 4.5\% per period)</td><td>Weight</td><td>Weight × Time</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">A. 8\% Coupon Bond</td><td>1</td><td>0.5</td><td>40</td><td>38.278</td><td>0.0390</td><td>0.0195</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1.0</td><td>40</td><td>36.629</td><td>0.0373</td><td>0.0373</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1.5</td><td>40</td><td>35.052</td><td>0.0357</td><td>0.0535</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>2.0</td><td>1,040</td><td>872.104</td><td>0.8880</td><td>1.7761</td></tr><tr><td>Sum:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>982.062</td><td>1.0000</td><td>1.8864</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">B. Zero-Coupon</td><td>1</td><td>0.5</td><td>0</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.0000</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.0000</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1.5</td><td>0</td><td>0.000</td><td>0.0000</td><td>0.0000</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>2.0</td><td>1,000</td><td>838.561</td><td>1.0000</td><td>2.0000</td></tr><tr><td>Sum:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>838.561</td><td>1.0000</td><td>2.0000</td></tr></table>

The duration of the  $8\%$  coupon bond increases to 1.8864 years. Price increases to \$982.062. The duration of the zero-coupon bond is unchanged at two years, although its price also increases (to \$ 838.561) when the interest rate falls.

2. a. If the interest rate increases from 9\% to 9.05\%, the bond price falls from $982.062 to $981.177. The percentage change in price is -0.0901\%.
$b$ . Using the initial semiannual rate of  $4.5\%$ , duration is 1.8864 years (see Concept Check 16.1), so the duration formula would predict a price change of

$$
- \frac {1 . 8 8 6 4}{1 . 0 4 5} \times . 0 0 0 5 = -. 0 0 0 9 0 3 = -. 0 9 0 3
$$ which is almost the same answer that we obtained from direct computation in part  $(a)$ .


3. The duration of a level perpetuity is  $(1 + y) / y$  or  $1 + 1 / y$ , which clearly falls as  $y$  increases. Tabulating duration as a function of  $y$  we get

<table><tr><td>y</td><td>D</td></tr><tr><td>0.01</td><td>101 years</td></tr><tr><td>0.02</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>0.05</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>0.10</td><td>11</td></tr></table>

4. In agreement with the duration rules presented in the chapter, you should find that duration is shorter when the coupon rate or yield to maturity is higher. Duration increases with maturity for most bonds. Duration is shorter when coupons are paid semiannually rather than annually because, on average, payments come earlier. Instead of waiting until year-end to receive the annual coupon, investors receive half the coupon midyear.
5. Macaulay's duration is defined as the weighted average of the time until receipt of each bond payment. Modified duration is defined as Macaulay's duration divided by  $1 + y$  (where  $y$  is yield per payment period, e.g., a semiannual yield if the bond pays semiannual coupons). One can demonstrate that for a straight bond, modified duration approximately equals the percentage change in bond price per change in yield. Effective duration captures this last property of modified duration. It is defined as percentage change in bond price per change in market interest rates. Effective duration for a bond with embedded options requires a valuation method that allows for such options in computing price changes. Effective duration cannot be related to a weighted average of times until payments because those payments are themselves uncertain.
6. The perpetuity's duration now would be  $1.08 / .08 = 13.5$ . We need to solve the following equation for  $w$ :

$$ w \times 2 + (1 - w) + 1 3. 5 = 6
$$

Therefore  $w = .6522$ .

7. Dedication would be more attractive. Cash flow matching eliminates the need for rebalancing and thus saves transaction costs.
8. Current price = 1,091.29

Forecasted price = \$100 × Annuity factor(10\%, 18 years) + \$1,000 × PV factor(10\%, 18 years)

$$
= \$ 1,000
$$

The future value of reinvested coupons  $= ($ 100 × 1.08) + $100 = $208

The 2-year return  $= \frac{\mathbb{S}208 + (\mathbb{S}1,000 - \mathbb{S}1,091.29)}{\mathbb{S}1,091.29} = 0.107$  or  $10.7\%$

The annualized rate of return over the 2-year period would then be  $(1.107)^{1/2} - 1 = .052$ , or  $5.2\%$ .

# Macroeconomic and Industry Analysis

# 17

THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF A stock depends on the dividend and earnings that can be expected from the firm. This is the heart of fundamental analysis—that is, the analysis of the determinants of value. Ultimately, the success of the firm determines the dividends it can pay to shareholders and the price it will command in the stock market. Because the prospects of the firm are tied to those of the broader economy, fundamental analysis must consider the business environment in which the firm operates. For some firms, macroeconomic and industry circumstances might have a greater influence on profits than the firm's relative performance within its industry. In other words, investors need to keep the big economic picture in mind.

Therefore, in analyzing a firm's prospects, it often makes sense to start with the broad economic environment, examining the state of the aggregate economy and even the international economy. From there, one considers the implications of the outside environment on the industry in which the firm operates. Finally, the firm's position within the industry is examined.


This chapter treats the broad-based aspects of fundamental analysis—macroeconomic and industry analysis. The two chapters that follow cover firm-specific analysis. We begin with a discussion of international factors relevant to firm performance and move on to an overview of the significance of the key variables usually used to summarize the state of the macroeconomy. We then discuss government macroeconomic policy. We conclude the analysis of the macroenvironment with a discussion of business cycles. Finally, we move to industry analysis, treating issues concerning the sensitivity of the firm to the business cycle, the typical life cycle of an industry, and strategic issues that affect industry performance.

# 17.1 The Global Economy

A top-down analysis of a firm's prospects must start with the global economy. The international economy might affect a firm's export prospects, the price competition it faces from competitors, or the profits it makes on investments abroad. Table 17.1 shows the

Table 17.1

GDP growth varied widely across regions: The southeast Asian economies in this table (China, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong) averaged growth above  $6\%$ , while Germany, in the center of the euro zone, grew only  $3.1\%$ .

Note: GDP growth is The Economist forecast for full year. Stock market return is for first 10 months of year.
Source: The Economist, November 6, 2021.


Despite the importance of regional macroeconomic conditions, there can be considerable variation in economic performance across countries, even within regions. In Europe, for example, the French economy grew at a rate of  $6.1\%$  in 2021, about double the rate in Germany.

Perhaps surprisingly, stock market returns did not always align with macroeconomic performance. This reflects the impact of near-market efficiency, where stock returns are driven by performance relative to previous expectations. For example, despite the fact that its economic growth rate was near the top of the pack, even that impressive performance seems to have been below prior expectations, as the Chinese stock market rose by only  $7\%$ . And the example of Hong Kong reminds us that stock prices are forward, not backward, looking: Despite its superior GDP growth rate compared to other countries, Hong Kong was the only country in our sample with a negative stock market return. This quite likely reflected growing concern about the changing stance the Chinese government seemed to be signaling in 2021 with regard to future business independence.

These data illustrate that the national economic environment, which is a crucial determinant of industry performance, can vary widely. It is far harder for businesses to succeed in a contracting economy than in an expanding one. This observation highlights the role of a big-picture macroeconomic analysis as a fundamental part of the investment process.

In addition, political uncertainty can pose considerable economic risks. Hong Kong is a case in point. But recent years offer many other relevant examples. The sovereign debt crisis of the last decade offers a compelling illustration of the interplay between politics and economics. The prospects of bailouts for struggling countries were in large part political issues, but with enormous consequences for the world economy. The exit of the U.K. from the European Union was another political battle with big economic implications. The ebb and flow of trade tensions between the U.S. and China in recent years have had big impacts on stock market performance. And while COVID-19 is not primarily a political issue, the battles over public health responses, including mandated business shutdowns, was and continues to be highly politically charged, with big implications for economic activity. At this level of analysis, it is clear that politics and economics are intimately entwined.


Other political issues that are less sensational but still extremely important to economic growth and investment returns include issues of protectionism and trade policy, the free flow of capital, and the status of a nation's workforce.

One obvious factor that affects the international competitiveness of a country's industries is the exchange rate between that country's currency and other currencies. The exchange rate is the rate at which domestic currency can be converted into foreign currency. For example, in late 2021, it took about 110 Japanese yen to purchase 1 U.S. dollar. We would say that the exchange rate is ¥110 per dollar or, equivalently, $.0091 per yen.

As exchange rates fluctuate, the dollar value of goods priced in foreign currency similarly fluctuates. In 1980, the dollar-yen exchange rate was about $.0045 per yen. Therefore, a U.S. citizen would need more than twice as many dollars in 2021 to buy a product selling for ¥10,000 as would have been required in 1980. If the Japanese producer were to maintain a fixed yen price for its product, the price expressed in U.S. dollars would more than double. This would make Japanese products more expensive to U.S. consumers, however, and result in lost sales. Obviously, appreciation of the yen creates a problem for Japanese producers that must compete with U.S. producers.

Figure 17.1 shows the change in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar relative to the purchasing power of the currencies of several major industrial countries from 2015 through 2021. The ratio of purchasing powers is called the "real," or inflation-adjusted, exchange rate. The change in the real exchange rate measures how much more or less expensive foreign goods have become to U.S. citizens, accounting for both exchange rate fluctuations and inflation differentials across countries. A positive value in Figure 17.1 means that the dollar has gained purchasing power relative to another currency; a negative number would indicate a depreciating dollar. Therefore, we see that the U.S. dollar has appreciated in real

Goods priced in these currencies became cheaper to U.S. consumers, while goods priced in U.S. dollars became less affordable to Chinese and Japanese consumers. The opposite is true of the U.K., where the real exchange rate shifted against the dollar.

# 17.2 The Domestic Macroeconomy

The macroeconomy is the environment in which all firms operate. The importance of the macroeconomy in determining investment performance is illustrated in Figure 17.2, which compares the level of the S&P 500 stock price index to forecasts of earnings per share of the S&P 500 companies. The graph shows that stock prices tend to rise along with earnings. While the exact ratio of stock price to earnings varies with factors such as interest rates, risk, inflation rates, and other variables, the graph does illustrate that, as a general rule, the ratio has tended to be in the range of 12-25. Given "normal" price-earnings ratios, we would expect the S&P 500 index to fall within these boundaries. While the earnings-multiplier rule clearly is not perfect—note the dramatic increase in the price-earnings multiple during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s—it also seems clear that the level of the broad market and aggregate earnings do trend together. Thus, the first step in forecasting the performance of the broad market is to assess the status of the economy as a whole.

Figure 17.2 shows that 2009 was another year in which the P/E multiple was much higher than even 25 times earnings. This reflects the fact that earnings in that year, at the height of the deep recession, were dramatically below trend projections. Market prices reflect earnings prospects well into the future and therefore fell by less than earnings in that particular year. As we will see in Chapter 18, P/E ratios are best interpreted relative to future, not past, earnings: Stock prices are forward-looking measures of firm value.

The ability to forecast the macroeconomy can translate into spectacular investment performance. But it is not enough to forecast the macroeconomy well. You must forecast it better than your competitors to earn abnormal profits. In this section, we will review some of the key economic statistics used to describe the state of the macroeconomy.

# Key Economic Indicators

Gross Domestic Product Gross domestic product, or GDP, is the measure of the economy's total production of goods and services. Rapidly growing GDP indicates an expanding economy with ample opportunity for a firm to increase sales. Another popular measure of the economy's output is industrial production. This statistic provides a measure of economic activity more narrowly focused on the manufacturing side of the economy.

**Employment** The unemployment rate is the percentage of the total labor force (i.e., those who are either working or actively seeking employment) yet to find work. The unemployment rate measures the extent to which the economy is operating at full capacity. The unemployment rate is a factor related to workers only, but further insight into the strength of the economy can be gleaned by examining the use of other factors of production. For example, analysts look at the factory capacity utilization rate, which is the ratio of actual output from factories to potential output.

Inflation The rate at which the general level of prices rises is called inflation. High rates of inflation often are associated with "overheated" economies, that is, economies where the demand for goods and services is outstripping productive capacity, which leads to upward pressure on prices. Most governments walk a fine line in their economic policies. They hope to stimulate their economies enough to maintain nearly full employment, but not so much as to bring on inflationary pressures. The perceived trade-off between inflation and unemployment is at the heart of many macroeconomic policy disputes. There is considerable room for disagreement as to the relative costs of inflation versus unemployment as well as the economy's relative vulnerability to these pressures at any particular time.

Interest Rates High interest rates reduce the present value of future cash flows, thereby reducing the attractiveness of investment opportunities. For this reason, real interest rates are key determinants of business investment expenditures. Demand for housing and high-priced consumer durables such as automobiles, which are commonly financed, also is highly sensitive to interest rates that affect interest payments. (In Chapter 5, Section 5.1, we examined the determinants of interest rates.)

Budget Deficit The budget deficit of the federal government is the difference between government spending and revenues. Any budgetary shortfall must be offset by government borrowing. Large amounts of government borrowing can force up interest rates by increasing the total demand for credit in the economy. Economists generally believe excessive government borrowing will "crowd out" private borrowing by forcing up interest rates and choking off business investment.

Sentiment Consumers' and producers' optimism or pessimism concerning the economy is an important determinant of economic performance. If consumers have confidence in their future income levels, for example, they will be more willing to spend on big-ticket items. Similarly, businesses will increase production and inventory levels if they anticipate higher demand for their products. In this way, beliefs influence how much consumption and investment will be pursued and affect the aggregate demand for goods and services.

# Concept Check 17.1

Consider an economy where the dominant industry is automobile production for both domestic consumption as well as export. Now suppose auto sales fall in response to an increase in the length of time people use their cars before replacing them. Describe the probable effects of this change on (a) GDP, (b) unemployment, (c) the government budget deficit, and (d) interest rates.

# 17.3 Demand and Supply Shocks

A useful way to organize your analysis of the factors that might influence the macroeconomy is to classify any impact as a supply or demand shock. A demand shock is an event that affects the demand for goods and services. Examples of positive demand shocks are reductions in tax rates, increases in the money supply, increases in government spending, or increases in foreign export demand. A supply shock is an event that influences production capacity and costs. Examples of supply shocks are changes in the price of energy; freezes, floods, or droughts that might destroy large quantities of agricultural crops; changes in the educational level of an economy's workforce; or changes in the wage rates at which the labor force is willing to work.

The fallout of COVID-19 presented good examples of adverse supply shocks. Disrupted supply chains made it both difficult and more expensive to find either consumer or producer goods, leading to price increases across the economy. As just one example, consider the dramatic reduction in automobile production (and dramatic price increases) in 2021 resulting from the shortage of component computer chips. COVID-19 also led to a reduction in the national workforce, as some workers chose to retire and others needed to leave jobs to attend to children who were no longer able to physically attend school. Labor force issues in the United States were exacerbated by even more severe problems in many countries where vaccines were less available and infection rates were higher.

Demand shocks are usually characterized by aggregate output moving in the same direction as interest rates and inflation. For example, a big increase in government spending will tend to stimulate the economy and increase GDP. It also might increase interest rates by increasing the demand for borrowed funds by both the government as well as businesses that might desire to borrow to finance new ventures. Finally, it could increase the inflation rate if the demand for goods and services is raised to a level at or beyond the total productive capacity of the economy.

Supply shocks are usually characterized by aggregate output moving in the opposite direction of inflation and interest rates. For example, a big increase in the price of energy is inflationary because costs of production rise and lead to increases in prices of finished goods. The increase in inflation rates over the near term can lead to higher nominal interest rates. Against this background, aggregate output will be falling. With raw materials more expensive, the productive capacity of the economy is reduced, as is the ability of individuals to purchase goods at now-higher prices. GDP, therefore, tends to fall.

COVID-19 and the government response to it generated demand as well as supply shocks. The nearby box explores some of the economic fallout from their interactions.

How can we relate this framework to investment analysis? You want to identify the industries that will be most helped or hurt in a particular macroeconomic scenario. For example, if you forecast a tightening of the money supply, you might want to avoid industries such as automobile producers that might be hurt by the likely increase in interest

Following a full decade of moderate inflation averaging less than  $2\%$  per year, the U.S. inflation rate in mid-2022 jumped to  $8.6\%$ . What caused such a dramatic increase? There were several suspects.

On the demand side, analysts point to expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. Fiscal policy in response to COVID-19 included substantial federal enhancements to unemployment benefits as well as direct income transfers from the government to individuals. Monetary policy similarly was highly expansionary, with the Fed pushing short-term interest rates close to zero. On the supply side, COVID-19 elicited engendered supply-side interruptions including worker departures from the labor market, shortages in key commodities such as computer chips, massive disruptions to the supply chain (most visibly, ocean transport of container ships), and increases in energy prices.

Any of these shocks would, by themselves, be inflationary. But the unusual dynamic behind the inflation surge was the interaction between these shocks. Normally, an increase in demand would elicit two responses from suppliers: primarily higher output and perhaps higher prices. But with severely constricted supply, the entire demand shock was absorbed by an increase in prices. Thus, supply disruptions exacerbated the impact of demand shocks. For example, auto producers who could not obtain chips to expand production to meet increased demand instead raised prices dramatically as consumers competed to obtain new cars. Similarly, as many workers withdrew from the labor market and firms competed to hire the remaining ones, wages rose, leading to higher costs in service industries.


This leaves the government with few of its conventional policy tools. For the most part, policy makers initially seemed resigned to wait for the supply-side distortions to resolve on their own as the supply chain could be rebuilt and workers (with less unemployment support) would reenter the job market. Higher prices should encourage investments by manufacturers to increase capacity. But the transition to this happier equilibrium has been, to say the least, rocky.

rates. We caution you again that these forecasts are no easy task. Macroeconomic predictions are notoriously unreliable. And again, you must be aware that in all likelihood your forecast will be made using only publicly available information. Any investment advantage you have will be a result only of better analysis—not better information.

# 17.4 Federal Government Policy

As the previous section would suggest, the government has two broad classes of macro-economic tools—those that affect the demand for goods and services and those that affect the supply. In the decades following the second World War, demand-side policy was of primary interest. The focus was on government spending, taxes, and monetary policy. Since the 1980s, however, increasing attention has been focused on supply-side economics. Broadly interpreted, supply-side concerns have to do with enhancing the productive capacity of the economy, rather than increasing the demand for goods and services. In practice, supply-side economists have focused on the appropriateness of the incentives to work, innovate, and take risks that result from our system of taxation. However, issues such as national policies on education, infrastructure (such as communication, power, and transportation systems), and research and development also are properly regarded as part of supply-side macroeconomic policy. The massive 1.2 trillion infrastructure bill of 2021 was focused on exactly these issues.

# Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy refers to the government's spending and tax actions and is part of "demand-side management." Fiscal policy is probably the most direct way to either stimulate or slow the economy. Decreases in government spending directly reduce the demand for goods and services. Similarly, increases in tax rates immediately siphon income from consumers and result in fairly rapid decreases in consumption.

Ironically, although fiscal policy has the most immediate impact on the economy, the formulation and implementation of such policy is usually painfully slow and involved.

This is because fiscal policy requires enormous amounts of compromise between the executive and legislative branches. Tax and spending policy must be initiated and voted on by Congress, which requires considerable political negotiations, and any legislation passed must be signed by the president, requiring more negotiation. Thus, although the impact of fiscal policy is relatively immediate, its formulation is so cumbersome that fiscal policy cannot in practice be used to fine-tune the economy.

Moreover, much of government spending, such as that for Medicare or Social Security, is nondiscretionary, meaning that it is determined by formula rather than policy and cannot be changed in response to economic conditions. This results in even greater limitations on fiscal policy as a tool of macroeconomic management.

A common way to summarize the net impact of government fiscal policy is to look at the government's budget deficit or surplus, which is simply the difference between revenues and expenditures. A deficit means the government is spending more than it is taking in by way of taxes. The net effect is to increase the demand for goods (via spending) by more than it reduces the demand for goods (via taxes), thereby stimulating the economy.

# Monetary Policy

Monetary policy refers to the manipulation of the money supply to affect the macroeconomy and is the other main leg of demand-side policy. Monetary policy works largely through its impact on interest rates. Increases in the money supply lower short-term interest rates, ultimately encouraging investment and consumption demand. Over longer periods, however, most economists believe a higher money supply leads only to a higher price level and does not have a permanent effect on economic activity. Thus, the monetary authorities face a difficult balancing act. Expansionary monetary policy probably will lower interest rates and thereby stimulate investment and some consumption demand in the short run, but these circumstances ultimately will lead only to higher prices. Of course, the time frame regarding "ultimately" is a subject of contentious debate. If it is long enough, then monetary policy can be a valuable tool for macroeconomic management. If it is too short, then expansionary monetary policy is more likely to increase prices than real GDP. This difficult-to-assess trade-off is at least implicitly central to all debate about proper policy.

Fiscal policy is cumbersome to implement but has a fairly direct impact on the economy, whereas monetary policy is easily formulated and implemented but has a less immediate impact. Monetary policy is determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Board members are appointed by the president for 14-year terms and are reasonably insulated from political pressure. The board is small enough, and often sufficiently dominated by its chairperson, that policy can be formulated and modulated relatively easily.

Implementation of monetary policy also is quite direct. The most widely used tool is the open market operation, in which the Fed buys or sells bonds for its own account. When the Fed buys securities, it simply "writes a check," thereby increasing the money supply. (Unlike us, the Fed can pay for the securities without drawing down funds at a bank account.) Conversely, when the Fed sells a security, the money paid for it leaves the money supply. Open market operations occur daily, allowing the Fed to fine-tune its monetary policy.

A variant on open market operations is so-called quantitative easing, which was first undertaken widely during the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and then again in response to the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, rather than buying primarily short-term government securities, the Fed buys a wider range of assets, for example, corporate and municipal bonds or even stocks. Central banks turn to quantitative easing when they believe conventional open market operations have reached the limit of their effectiveness. For example, even if short-term interest rates are already near zero, quantitative easing may still stimulate the economy by increasing the money supply and by raising the prices (and lowering the yields) of the riskier assets in the purchase program.


Other tools at the Fed's disposal are the discount rate, which is the interest rate it charges banks on short-term loans, and the reserve requirement, which is the fraction of deposits that banks must hold as cash on hand or as deposits with the Fed. Reductions in the discount rate signal a more expansionary monetary policy. Lowering reserve requirements allows banks to make more loans with each dollar of deposits and stimulates the economy by increasing the effective money supply.

While the discount rate is under the direct control of the Fed, it is changed relatively infrequently. The federal funds rate is by far the better guide to Federal Reserve policy. The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks make short-term, usually overnight, loans to each other. These loans occur because some banks need to borrow funds to meet reserve requirements, while other banks have excess funds. Unlike the discount rate, the fed funds rate is a market rate, meaning that it is determined by supply and demand rather than being set administratively. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve Board targets the fed funds rate, expanding or contracting the money supply through open market operations as it nudges the fed funds rate to its targeted value. This is the benchmark short-term U.S. interest rate, and as such it has considerable influence on other interest rates in the United States and the rest of the world.

Monetary policy affects the economy in a more roundabout way than fiscal policy. Whereas fiscal policy directly stimulates or dampens the economy, monetary policy works largely through its impact on interest rates. Increases in the money supply lower interest rates, which stimulates investment demand. As the quantity of money in the economy increases, investors will find that their portfolios of assets include too much money. They will rebalance their portfolios by buying securities such as bonds, forcing bond prices up and interest rates down. In the longer run, individuals may increase their holdings of stocks as well and ultimately buy real assets, which stimulates consumption demand directly. The ultimate effect of monetary policy on investment and consumption demand, however, is less immediate than that of fiscal policy.

# Concept Check 17.2

Suppose the government wants to stimulate the economy without increasing interest rates. What combination of fiscal and monetary policy might accomplish this goal?

# Supply-Side Policies

Fiscal policy and monetary policy are demand-oriented tools that affect the economy by stimulating the total demand for goods and services. The implicit belief is that the economy will not by itself arrive at a full employment equilibrium and that macroeconomic policy can push the economy toward this goal. In contrast, supply-side policies treat the issue of the productive capacity of the economy. The goal is to create an environment in which workers and owners of capital have the maximum incentive and ability to produce and develop goods.

Supply-side economists also pay considerable attention to tax policy. Whereas demand-siders look at the effect of taxes on consumption demand, supply-siders focus on incentives and marginal tax rates. They argue that lowering tax rates will elicit more investment and improve incentives to work, thereby enhancing economic growth. Some go so far as to claim that reductions in tax rates can lead to increases in tax revenues because the lower tax rates will cause the economy and the revenue tax base to grow by more than the tax rate is reduced.

# Concept Check 17.3

Large tax cuts in 2018 were followed by relatively rapid growth in GDP. How would demand-side and supply-side economists differ in their interpretations of this phenomenon?

# 17.5 Business Cycles

We've looked at the tools the government uses to fine-tune the economy, attempting to maintain low unemployment and low inflation. Despite these efforts, economies repeatedly seem to pass through good and bad times. One determinant of the broad asset allocation decision of many analysts is a forecast of whether the macroeconomy is improving or deteriorating. A forecast that differs from the market consensus can have a major impact on investment strategy.

# The Business Cycle

The economy recurrently experiences periods of expansion and contraction, although the length and depth of those cycles can be irregular. This recurring pattern of recession and recovery is called the business cycle. Transition points across cycles are called peaks and troughs. A peak is the transition from the end of an expansion to the start of a contraction. A trough occurs at the bottom of a recession just as the economy enters a recovery.

As the economy passes through different stages of the business cycle, the relative performance of different industry groups might be expected to vary. For example, at a trough, as the economy begins to recover from a recession, one would expect cyclical industries, those with above-average sensitivity to the state of the economy, to perform best. Examples of cyclical industries are producers of durable goods such as automobiles. Because purchases of these goods can be deferred during a recession, sales are particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. Other cyclical industries are producers of capital goods, that is, goods used by other firms to produce their own products. When demand is slack, few companies will be expanding and purchasing capital goods. Therefore, the capital goods industry bears the brunt of a slowdown but does well in an expansion.

In contrast to cyclical firms, defensive industries have comparatively less sensitivity to the business cycle. These are industries that produce goods for which sales and profits are least sensitive to the state of the economy. Defensive industries include food producers and processors, pharmaceutical firms, and public utilities. These industries will outperform others when the economy enters a recession.

The cyclical/defensive classification corresponds well to the notion of systematic or market risk introduced in our discussion of portfolio theory. When perceptions about the health of the economy become more optimistic, for example, the prices of most stocks will increase as forecasts of profitability rise. Because cyclical firms are most sensitive to such developments, their stock prices will rise the most. These firms will tend to have high-beta stocks. Conversely, defensive firms will have low betas and performance that is less responsive to overall market conditions.

If your assessments of the state of the business cycle were reliably more accurate than those of other investors, you would simply choose cyclical industries when you are relatively more optimistic about the economy and defensive firms when you are relatively more pessimistic. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to determine when the economy is passing through a peak or a trough. If it were, choosing between cyclical and defensive industries would be easy. As we know from our discussion of efficient markets, however, attractive investment choices will rarely be obvious. It usually is not apparent that a recession or expansion has started or ended until several months after the fact. With hindsight, the transitions from expansion to recession and back might seem clear, but it is often quite difficult to tell in real time whether the economy is heating up or slowing down.

# Economic Indicators

Given the cyclical nature of the business cycle, it is not surprising that to some extent the cycle can be predicted. A set of cyclical indicators computed by the Conference Board helps forecast, measure, and interpret short-term fluctuations in economic activity. Leading economic indicators are those economic series that tend to rise or fall in advance of the rest of the economy. Coincident and lagging indicators, as their names suggest, move in tandem with or somewhat after the broad economy, respectively.

Ten series are grouped into a widely followed composite index of leading economic indicators. Similarly, four coincident and seven lagging indicators form separate indexes. The composition of these indexes appears in Table 17.2.

Figure 17.3 graphs the leading, lagging, and coincident indicators over the last several decades. The shaded areas in the figure represent periods of recession. The dates at the top of the chart (with format Year: Month) correspond to peaks and troughs (i.e., the turning

The stock market price index is a leading indicator. This is what we would expect, as stock prices are forward-looking predictors of future profitability. Unfortunately, this makes the series of leading indicators much less useful for investment policy—by the time the series predicts an upturn, the market has already made its move. Although the business cycle may be somewhat predictable, the stock market may not be. This is just one more manifestation of the efficient markets hypothesis.

Other leading indicators focus directly on decisions made today that will affect production in the near future. For example, manufacturers' new orders for goods, contracts, and orders for plant and equipment and housing starts all signal a coming expansion in the economy.

A wide range of economic indicators is released to the public on a regular "economic calendar."

# 17.6 Industry Analysis

Industry analysis is important for the same reason that macroeconomic analysis is. Just as it is difficult for an industry to perform well when the macroeconomy is ailing, it is unusual for a firm in a troubled industry to perform well. Similarly, just as we have seen that economic performance can vary widely across countries, performance also can vary widely across industries. Figure 17.5 illustrates the dispersion of industry performance. It shows return on equity based on 2020 profitability for several major industry groups. ROE in this COVID-19-affected year ranged from  $-47.2\%$  in the air-transport industry (with severe travel disruptions) to  $29\%$  for soft drinks (in the workfrom-home economy).

Given the wide variation in profitability, it is not surprising that industry groups exhibit considerable dispersion in their stock market performance. Figure 17.6 presents the 2020 stock market performance of several industry groups. The spread in performance is remarkable, ranging from a  $42\%$  gain in the retail industry to a  $34\%$  loss in the coal industry. This range of performance was very much available to virtually all investors. Industry-focused exchange traded funds such as iShares trade like stocks and thus allow even small investors to take a position in each traded industry. Alternatively, one can invest in mutual funds with an industry focus. For example, Fidelity offers over 40 sector funds, each with a particular industry focus.

# Defining an Industry

Although the concept of an "industry" seems clear-cut, deciding where to draw the line between one industry and another can be difficult in practice. Consider, for example, the wide dispersion of firms included in the application software industry. As Figure 17.7 demonstrates, ROA ranged from only  $3.0\%$  for Symantec to  $14.6\%$  for Microsoft. Despite their similarities, these firms clearly operated in different business niches.

A useful way to define industry groups in practice is given by the North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS codes. These are codes assigned to group firms in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada [trade] Agreement for statistical analysis. The first two digits of the NAICS codes denote very broad industry classifications. For example, Table 17.4 shows that the codes for all construction firms start with 23. The next digits define the industry grouping more narrowly. For example, codes starting with 236 denote building construction, 2361 denotes residential construction, and 236115 denotes single-family construction. The first five digits of the NAICS codes are common across all three USMCA countries. The sixth digit is country-specific and allows for a finer partition of industries. Firms with the same four-digit NAICS codes are commonly taken to be in the same industry.

Table 17.4
Examples of NAICS industry codes

<table><tr><td>NAICS Code</td><td>NAICS Title</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Construction</td></tr><tr><td>236</td><td>Construction of Buildings</td></tr><tr><td>2361</td><td>Residential Building Construction</td></tr><tr><td>23611</td><td>Residential Building Construction</td></tr><tr><td>236115</td><td>New Single-Family Housing Construction</td></tr><tr><td>236116</td><td>New Multifamily Housing Construction</td></tr><tr><td>236118</td><td>Residential Remodelers</td></tr><tr><td>2362</td><td>Nonresidential Building Construction</td></tr><tr><td>23621</td><td>Industrial Building Construction</td></tr><tr><td>23622</td><td>Commercial and Institutional Building Construction</td></tr></table>

2These codes are used for firms operating inside the USMCA (U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement). The USMCA is the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. NAICS codes replaced the Standard Industry Classification or SIC codes previously used in the U.S.

NAICS industry classifications are not perfect. For example, both Kohl's and Neiman Marcus might be classified as "Department Stores." Yet the former is a high-volume "value" store, whereas the latter is a high-margin elite retailer. Are they really in the same industry? Still, these classifications are a tremendous aid in conducting industry analysis because they provide a means of focusing on very broad or fairly narrowly defined groups of firms.

Several other industry classifications are provided by other analysts; for example, Standard & Poor's reports on the performance of about 100 industry groups. S&P computes stock price indexes for each group, which is useful in assessing past investment performance. The Value Line Investment Survey reports on the conditions and prospects of about 1,700 firms, grouped into about 90 industries. Value Line's analysts prepare forecasts of the performance of industry groups as well as of each firm.

# Sensitivity to the Business Cycle

Once the analyst forecasts the state of the macroeconomy, it is necessary to determine the implication of that forecast for specific industries. Not all industries are equally sensitive to the business cycle.

To illustrate, Figure 17.8 plots changes in retail sales (year over year) in two industries: jewelry and grocery stores. Clearly, sales of jewelry, which is a luxury good, fluctuate more widely than those of groceries. Jewelry sales jumped in 1999 at the height of the dot-com boom but fell steeply in the recessions of 2001 and 2008-2009. In contrast, sales growth in the grocery industry is relatively stable, with no years in which sales meaningfully decline. These patterns reflect the fact that jewelry is a discretionary good, whereas most grocery products are staples for which demand will not fall significantly even in hard times.

Three factors determine the sensitivity of a firm's earnings to the business cycle. First is the sensitivity of sales. Necessities show little sensitivity to business conditions. Examples of industries in this group are food, drugs, and medical services. Other industries with low sensitivity are those for which income is not a crucial determinant of demand. Tobacco products are an example of this type of industry. In contrast, firms in industries such as machine tools, steel, autos, and transportation are highly sensitive to the state of the economy.

Figure 17.8 Industry cyclicality: Growth of sales, year over year, in two industries; sales of jewelry show much greater variation than sales of groceries.

The second factor determining business cycle sensitivity is operating leverage, which refers to the division between fixed and variable costs. (Fixed costs are those the firm incurs regardless of its production levels. Variable costs are those that rise or fall as the firm produces more or less product.) Profits of firms with greater amounts of variable as opposed to fixed costs will be less sensitive to business conditions. This is because in economic downturns, these firms can reduce costs as output falls in response to falling sales. Profits for firms with high fixed costs will swing more widely with sales because costs do not move to offset revenue variability. These firms are said to have high operating leverage because small swings in business conditions can have large impacts on profitability.

# Example 17.1 Operating Leverage

Consider two firms operating in the same industry with identical revenues in all phases of the business cycle: recession, normal, and expansion. Firm A has short-term leases on most of its equipment and can reduce its lease expenditures when production slackens. It has fixed costs of  \$5 million and variable costs of\$ 1 per unit of output. Firm B has long-term leases on most of its equipment and must make lease payments regardless of economic conditions. Its fixed costs are higher, \$8 million, but its variable costs are only $.50 per unit. Table 17.5 shows that Firm A will do better in recessions than Firm B, but not as well in expansions. A's costs move in conjunction with its revenues to help performance in downturns and impede performance in upturns.

We can quantify operating leverage by measuring how sensitive profits are to changes in sales. The degree of operating leverage (DOL) is defined as

$$
\mathrm {D O L} = \frac {\text {P e r c e n t a g e c h a n g e i n p r o f i t s}}{\text {P e r c e n t a g e c h a n g e i n s a l s e s}}
$$

DOL greater than 1 indicates some operating leverage. For example, if  $\mathrm{DOL} = 2$ , then for every  $1\%$  change in sales, profits will change by  $2\%$  in the same direction, either up or down.

We have seen that the degree of operating leverage increases with a firm's exposure to fixed costs. In fact, one can show that DOL depends on fixed costs in the following manner:

$$
\mathrm {D O L} = 1 + \frac {\text {F i x e d c o s t s}}{\text {P r o f i t s}}
$$

Table 17.5

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Recession</td><td colspan="2">Normal</td><td colspan="2">Expansion</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>A</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>Sales (million units)</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Price per unit</td><td>$ 2</td><td>$ 2</td><td>$ 2</td><td>$ 2</td><td>$ 2</td><td>$ 2</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue ($ million)</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed costs ($ million)</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Variable costs ($ million)</td><td>5</td><td>2.5</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>3.5</td></tr><tr><td>Total costs ($ million)</td><td>$10</td><td>$10.5</td><td>$11</td><td>$11</td><td>$12</td><td>$11.5</td></tr><tr><td>Profits</td><td>$ 0</td><td>$ (0.5)</td><td>$ 1</td><td>$ 1</td><td>$ 2</td><td>$ 2.5</td></tr></table>

# Example 17.2 Degree of Operating Leverage

Return to the two firms illustrated in Table 17.5 and compare profits and sales in the normal scenario for the economy with those in a recession. Profits of Firm A fall by  $100\%$  (from  $\$ 1$  million to zero) when sales fall by  $16.7\%$  (from  $\$ 6$  million to  $\$ 5$  million):

$$
\mathrm {DOL} (\text {Firm A}) = \frac {\text {Percentage change in profits}}{\text {Percentage change in sales}} = \frac {- 100 \%}{- 16.7 \%} = 6
$$

We can confirm the relationship between DOL and fixed costs as follows:

$$
\mathrm {D O L} (\text {F i r m A}) = 1 + \frac {\text {F i x e d c o s t s}}{\text {P r o f i t s}} = 1 + \frac {\mathbb {S} 5 \text {m i l l i o n}}{\mathbb {S} 1 \text {m i l l i o n}} = 6
$$

Firm B has higher fixed costs, and its operating leverage is higher. Again, compare data for a normal scenario to a recession. Profits for Firm B fall by  $150\%$ , from  $\$ 1$  million to  $-\$ .5$  million. Operating leverage for Firm B is therefore

$$
\mathrm {DOL} (\text {Firm B}) = \frac {\text {Percentage change in profits}}{\text {Percentage change in sales}} = \frac {- 150 \%}{- 16.7 \%} = 9
$$ which reflects its higher level of fixed costs:


$$
\mathrm {D O L} (\text {F i r m B}) = 1 + \frac {\text {F i x e d c o s t s}}{\text {P r o f i t s}} = 1 + \frac {\mathbb {S} 8 \text {m i l l i o n}}{\mathbb {S} 1 \text {m i l l i o n}} = 9
$$

The third factor influencing business cycle sensitivity is financial leverage, which is the use of borrowing. Interest payments on debt must be paid regardless of sales. They are fixed costs that also increase the sensitivity of profits to business conditions. (We will have more to say about financial leverage in Chapter 19.)

Investors should not always prefer industries with lower sensitivity to the business cycle. Firms in sensitive industries will have high-beta stocks and are riskier. But while they swing lower in downturns, they also swing higher in upturns. As always, the key issue is whether the expected return on the investment is fair compensation for the risks borne.

# Sector Rotation

One way that many analysts think about the relationship between industry analysis and the business cycle is the notion of sector rotation. The idea is to shift the portfolio more heavily into industry or sector groups that are expected to outperform others based on one's assessment of the state of the business cycle.

Figure 17.9 is a stylized depiction of the business cycle. Near the peak of the business cycle, the economy might be overheated, with high inflation and interest rates and price pressures on basic commodities. This might be a good time to invest in firms engaged in natural resource extraction and processing such as minerals or petroleum.

Following a peak, when the economy enters a contraction or recession, one would expect defensive industries that are less sensitive to economic conditions, for example, pharmaceuticals, food, and other necessities, to be the best performers. At the height of the contraction, financial firms will be hurt by shrinking loan volume and higher default rates. Toward the end of the recession, however, contractions induce lower inflation and interest rates, which favor financial firms.

At the trough of a recession, the economy is poised for recovery and subsequent expansion. Firms might thus be spending on purchases of new equipment to meet anticipated increases in demand. This, then, would be a good time to invest in capital goods industries, such as equipment, transportation, or construction.

Finally, in an expansion, the economy is growing rapidly. Cyclical industries such as consumer durables and luxury items will be most profitable in this stage of the cycle. Banks might also do well in expansions because loan volume will be high and default exposure low when the economy is growing rapidly.


Figure 17.10 illustrates sector rotation. When investors are relatively pessimistic about the economy, they will shift into noncyclical industries such as consumer staples or health care. When anticipating an expansion, they will prefer more cyclical industries such as materials and technology.

Don't forget that sector rotation, like any other form of market timing, will be successful only if one anticipates the next stage of the business cycle better than other investors. The business cycle depicted in Figure 17.9 is highly stylized. In real life, it is never as clear how long each phase of the cycle will last, nor how extreme it will be. These forecasts are where analysts need to earn their keep.

In which phase of the business cycle would you expect the following industries to enjoy their best performance?

# Industry Life Cycles

Examine the software application industry and you will find many firms with high rates of investment, high rates of return on investment, and low dividend payout rates. Do the same for the public utility industry and you will find lower rates of return, lower investment rates, and higher dividend payout rates. Why should this be?

Software application firms have many opportunities for highly profitable investment of resources. New products are protected by patents, and profit margins are high. With such lucrative opportunities, firms find it advantageous to reinvest profits in the firm. The companies generally grow rapidly.

Eventually, however, growth must slow. The high profit rates will induce new firms to enter the industry. Increasing competition will hold down prices and profit margins. New technologies become proven and more predictable, risk levels fall, and entry becomes even easier. As internal investment opportunities become less attractive, a lower fraction of profits is reinvested in the firm. Cash dividends increase.

Ultimately, in a mature industry, we observe "cash cows," firms with stable dividends and cash flows and little risk. Growth rates might be similar to that of the overall economy. Industries in early stages of their life cycles offer high-risk/high-potential-return investments. Mature industries offer lower-risk, lower-return profiles.

This analysis suggests that a typical industry life cycle might be described by four stages: a start-up stage, characterized by extremely rapid growth; a consolidation stage, characterized by growth that is less rapid but still faster than that of the general economy; a maturity stage, characterized by growth no faster than the general economy; and a stage of relative decline, in which the industry grows less rapidly than the rest of the economy, or actually shrinks. This industry life cycle is illustrated in Figure 17.11. Let us turn to an elaboration of each of these stages.

Start-Up Stage The early stages of an industry are often characterized by a new technology or product such as desktop personal computers in the 1980s, cell phones in the 1990s, or touchscreen smartphones introduced in 2007. At this stage, it is difficult to predict which firms will emerge as industry leaders. Some firms will turn out to be wildly successful, and others will fail altogether. Therefore, there is considerable risk in selecting one particular firm within the industry. At the moment, for example, there is a battle ranging for dominance in 5G hardware. While Huawei had an early lead, cybersecurity concerns in the West led to restrictions against it. Now Samsung is viewed as having an opening to become a big player in the market, alongside the other early entrants, Nokia and Ericsson. It is difficult to predict which firm will ultimately win this battle.


At the industry level, however, it is clear that sales and earnings will grow at an extremely rapid rate because the new product has not yet saturated its market. For example, in 2020, relatively few households had 5G-enabled smartphones. The potential market for the product therefore was huge. In contrast, consider the market for a mature product like refrigerators. Almost all households in the United States already have refrigerators, so the market for this good is primarily composed of households replacing old ones, which obviously limits the potential growth rate.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/5567b3ef783afa89a08e7679ca6bc6a451df5d891052b3ab883d3e7ef50d909d.jpg)
Figure 17.11 The industry life cycle
Consolidation Stage After a product becomes established, industry leaders begin to emerge. The survivors from the start-up stage are more stable, and market share is easier to predict. Therefore, the performance of the surviving firms will more closely track the performance of the overall industry. The industry still grows faster than the rest of the economy as the product penetrates the marketplace and becomes more commonly used.

Maturity Stage At this point, the product has reached its full potential for use by consumers. Further growth might merely track growth in the general economy. The product has become far more standardized, and producers are forced to compete to a greater extent on the basis of price. This leads to narrower profit margins and further pressure on profits. Firms at this stage sometimes are characterized as cash cows, providing reasonably stable cash flow but offering little opportunity for profitable expansion. The cash flow is best "milked from" rather than reinvested in the company.

We pointed to desktop PCs as a start-up industry in the 1980s. By the mid-1990s it was a mature industry, with high market penetration, considerable price competition, low profit margins, and slowing sales. By the 1990s, desktops were progressively giving way to laptops, which were in their own start-up stage. Within a dozen years, laptops had in turn entered a maturity stage, with standardization, low profit margins, and new competition from tablets and large-screen smartphones.

Relative Decline In this stage, the industry might grow at less than the rate of the overall economy, or it might even shrink. This could be due to obsolescence of the product, competition from new low-cost suppliers, or competition from new products; consider, for example, the steady displacement of desktops, first by laptops and now by tablets.

At which stage in the life cycle are investments in an industry most attractive? Conventional wisdom is that investors should seek firms in high-growth industries. This recipe for success is simplistic, however. If the security prices already reflect the likelihood for high growth, then it is too late to make money from that knowledge. Moreover, high growth and fat profits encourage competition from other producers. The exploitation of profit opportunities brings about new sources of supply that eventually reduce prices, profits, investment returns, and finally growth. This is the dynamic behind the progression from one stage of the industry life cycle to another. The famous portfolio manager Peter Lynch makes this point in One Up on Wall Street:

Many people prefer to invest in a high-growth industry, where there's a lot of sound and fury. Not me. I prefer to invest in a low-growth industry. . . . In a low-growth industry, especially one that's boring and upsets people [such as funeral homes or the oil-drum retrieval business], there's no problem with competition. You don't have to protect your flanks from potential rivals . . . and this gives you the leeway to continue to grow.

In fact, Lynch uses an industry classification system in a very similar spirit to the life-cycle approach we have described. He places firms in the following six groups:

Slow Growers Large and aging companies that will grow only slightly faster than the broad economy. These firms have matured from their earlier fast-growth phase. They usually have steady cash flow and pay a generous dividend, indicating that the firm is generating more cash than can be profitably reinvested in the firm.

Stalwarts Large, well-known firms like Coca-Cola or Hershey's. They grow faster than the slow growers but are not in the very rapid growth start-up stage. They also tend to be in noncyclical industries that are relatively unaffected by recessions.

Fast Growers Small and aggressive new firms with annual growth rates in the neighborhood of  $20 - 25\%$ . Company growth can be due to broad industry growth or to an increase in market share in a more mature industry.

Cyclicals These are firms with sales and profits that regularly expand and contract along with the business cycle. Examples are auto companies, steel companies, or the construction industry.

Turnarounds These are firms that are in bankruptcy or soon might be. If they can recover from what might appear to be imminent disaster, they can offer tremendous investment returns. A good example of this type of firm would be Chrysler in 1982, when it required a government guarantee on its debt to avoid bankruptcy. The stock price rose 15-fold in the next five years.

Asset Plays These are firms that have valuable assets not currently reflected in the stock price. For example, a company may own or be located on valuable real estate that is worth as much as or more than the company's business enterprises. Sometimes the hidden asset can be tax-loss carryforwards. Other times the assets may be intangible. For example, a cable company might have a valuable list of cable subscribers. These assets do not immediately generate cash flow and so may be more easily overlooked by other analysts attempting to value the firm.

# Industry Structure and Performance

The maturation of an industry involves regular changes in the firm's competitive environment. As a final topic, we examine the relationship among industry structure, competitive strategy, and profitability. Michael Porter has highlighted these five determinants of competition: threat of entry from new competitors, rivalry between existing competitors, price pressure from substitute products, bargaining power of buyers, and bargaining power of suppliers.[5]

Threat of Entry New entrants to an industry put pressure on price and profits. Even if a firm has not yet entered an industry, the potential for it to do so places pressure on prices because high prices and profit margins will encourage entry by new competitors. Therefore, barriers to entry can be a key determinant of industry profitability. Barriers can take many forms. For example, existing firms may already have secure distribution channels for their products based on long-standing relationships with customers or suppliers that would be costly for a new entrant to duplicate. Brand loyalty also makes it difficult for new entrants to penetrate a market and gives firms more pricing discretion. Proprietary knowledge or patent protection also may give firms advantages in serving a market. Finally, an existing firm's experience in a market may give it cost advantages due to the learning that takes place over time.

Rivalry between Existing Competitors When there are several competitors in an industry, there will generally be more price competition and lower profit margins as competitors seek to expand their share of the market. Slow industry growth contributes to this competition because expansion must come at the expense of a rival's market share. High fixed costs also create pressure to reduce prices because they put greater pressure on firms to operate near full capacity. Industries producing relatively homogeneous goods are also subject to considerable price pressure because firms cannot compete on the basis of product differentiation.

Pressure from Substitute Products Substitute products means that the industry faces competition from firms in related industries. For example, sugar producers compete with corn syrup producers. Wool producers compete with synthetic fiber producers. The availability of substitutes limits the prices that can be charged to customers.

Bargaining Power of Buyers If a buyer purchases a large fraction of an industry's output, it will have considerable bargaining power and can demand price concessions. For example, auto producers can put pressure on suppliers of auto parts. This reduces the profitability of the auto parts industry.

Bargaining Power of Suppliers If a supplier of a key input has monopolistic control over the product, it can demand higher prices for the good and squeeze profits out of the industry. One special case of this issue pertains to organized labor as a supplier of a key input to the production process. Labor unions engage in collective bargaining to increase the wages paid to workers. When the labor market is highly unionized, a significant share of the potential profits in the industry can be captured by the workforce.

The key factor determining the bargaining power of suppliers is the availability of substitute products. If substitutes are available, the supplier has little clout and cannot extract higher prices.

# SUMMARY

1. Macroeconomic policy aims to maintain the economy near full employment without aggravating inflationary pressures. The proper trade-off between these two goals is a source of ongoing debate.
2. The traditional tools of macroeconomic policy are government spending and tax collection, which constitute fiscal policy, and manipulation of the money supply via monetary policy. Expansionary fiscal policy can stimulate the economy and increase GDP but tends to increase interest rates. Expansionary monetary policy works by lowering interest rates.
3. The business cycle is the economy's recurring pattern of expansions and recessions. Leading economic indicators can be used to anticipate the evolution of the business cycle because their values tend to change before those of other key economic variables.
4. Industries differ in their sensitivity to the business cycle. More sensitive industries tend to be those producing high-priced durable goods for which the consumer has considerable discretion as to the timing of purchase. Examples are jewelry, automobiles, or consumer durables. Other sensitive industries are those that produce capital equipment for other firms. Operating leverage and financial leverage increase sensitivity to the business cycle.
5. Industries generally pass through a predictable life cycle. In the start-up stage, growth is rapid as a new product begins to permeate the economy, but it is difficult at this point to predict which firms will emerge as industry leaders. As the product becomes established, the industry enters a consolidation stage and industry leaders begin to emerge. In the maturity stage, the product has largely saturated the market, and further growth merely tracks that of the general economy. Finally, the industry enters a stage of relative decline as it faces competition from new products.

Use the following case in answering Problems 18 through 21: Institutional Advisors for All Inc., or IAAI, is a consulting firm that advises foundations, endowments, pension plans, and insurance companies. The research department predicts an upward trend in job creation and consumer confidence, which it expects to continue for the next few years. Other domestic leading indicators that the research department considers are industrial production, average weekly hours in manufacturing, the S&P 500 stock index, the money supply, and the index of consumer expectations.

In light of the predictions for job creation and consumer confidence, the investment advisers at IAAI want to make recommendations for their clients. Their primary concern is to forecast how the trends in job creation and consumer confidence should affect bond prices and how those trends should affect stock prices.

The research department also notes that stocks have been trending up in the past year, and this information is factored into their forecasts of the overall economy. The researchers consider an upward-trending stock market a positive economic indicator in itself; however, they disagree as to the reason this should be the case.

18. IAAI foresees positive trends for both job creation and consumer confidence. Which, if either, of these trends should have a positive effect on stock prices?
19. Stock prices are useful as a leading indicator. To explain this phenomenon, which of the following is most accurate? Stock prices:

$a$ . Predict future interest rates as well as trends in other indicators.
b. Do not predict future interest rates, nor are they correlated with other leading indicators; the usefulness of stock prices as a leading indicator is a mystery.
c. Reflect the trends in other leading indicators only and do not have predictive power of their own.

20. Which of the domestic series that the IAAI research department listed for use as leading indicators is least appropriate?

a. Industrial production.
$b$ . Average weekly hours in manufacturing.
c. The S&P 500 index.

21. IAAI uses primarily historical data in its calculations and forecasts. Which of the following regarding the actions of IAAI is most accurate?

a. Credit risk premiums may be useful to IAAI because they are based on actual market expectations.
b. IAAI should use a moving average of recent stock returns when times are bad because it will result in a high expected equity risk premium.
$c$ . Long time spans should be used so that regime changes can be factored into the forecasts.

Use the following case in answering Problems 22 through 25: Mary Smith, a CFA candidate, was recently hired for an analyst position at a large bank in London. Her first assignment is to examine the competitive strategies employed by various French wineries.

Smith's report identifies four wineries that are the major players in the French wine industry. Key characteristics of each are cited in Table 17A. In the body of Smith's report, she notes that over the past five years, the French wine industry has not responded to changing consumer tastes. Profit margins have declined steadily, and the number of firms representing the industry has decreased from 10 to 4. It appears that participants in the French wine industry must consolidate in order to survive.

Smith's report notes that French consumers have strong bargaining power over the industry. She supports this conclusion with the following key points:

- Many consumers are drinking more beer than wine with meals and at social occasions.
- Increasing sales over the Internet have allowed consumers to better research the wines, read opinions from other customers, and identify which producers have the best prices.
- The French wine industry is consolidating and consists of only 4 wineries today compared to 10 wineries five years ago.
- More than  $65\%$  of the business for the French wine industry consists of purchases from restaurants. Restaurants typically make purchases in bulk, buying four to five cases of wine at a time.
- Land where the soil is fertile enough to grow grapes necessary for the wine production process is scarce in France.

Smith takes her report to her boss, Sandra VanDriesen, to review and tells her, "In my report I have classified the South Winery as a stuck-in-the-middle firm. It tries to be a consumer cost leader by selling its wine at a price that is slightly below the other firms, but it also tries to differentiate itself from its competitors by producing wine in bottles with curved necks, which increases its cost structure. The end result is that the South Winery's profit margin gets squeezed from both sides." VanDriesen replies, I believe that the South Winery could succeed at following both a cost leadership and a differentiation strategy if its operations were separated into distinct operating units, with each unit pursuing a different competitive strategy." Smith makes a note to do more research on generic competitive strategies to verify VanDriesen's assertions before publishing the final draft of her report.

Characteristics of Four Major French Wineries

22. If the French home currency were to greatly appreciate in value compared to the English currency, what is the likely impact on the competitive position of the East Winery?

$a$  .Make the firm less competitive in the English market.
$b$ . No impact because the major market for East Winery is England, not France.
$c$ . Make the firm more competitive in the English market.

23. Which of Smith's points effectively support the conclusion that consumers have strong bargaining power over the industry?

24. Smith notes in her report that the West Winery might differentiate its wine product on attributes that buyers perceive to be important. Which of the following attributes would be the most likely area of focus for the West Winery to create a differentiated product?

$a$ . The method of delivery for the product.
$b$  . The price of the product.
c. A focus on customers aged 30-45.

25. Smith makes three observations about the North Winery and its strategic planning process: i. North Winery's price and cost forecasts account for its forecasted changes in the structure of the French wine industry.

ii. North Winery places each of its business units into one of three categories: build, hold, or harvest [i.e., divest].
iii. North Winery uses market share as the key measure of its competitive position.

Which observation(s) least support(s) the conclusion that the North Winery's strategic planning process is guided and informed by its generic competitive strategy?

26. Atech has fixed costs of \$7 million and profits of \$4 million. Its competitor, ZTech, is roughly the same size and this year earned the same profits, \$4 million. However, ZTech operates with fixed costs of only \$5 million but higher variable costs.

$a$ . Which firm has higher operating leverage?
b. Which firm would you expect to have profits that are more sensitive to the state of the economy?
c. Which firm would you expect to have the higher stock market beta?

27. OceanGate sells external hard drives for \$200 each. Its total fixed costs are \$30 million, and its variable costs per unit are 140. The corporate tax rate is 21\%. If the economy is strong, the firm will sell 2 million drives, but if there is a recession, it will sell only half as many.

a. What will be the percentage decline in sales if the economy enters a recession?
$b$ . What will be the percentage decline in profits if the economy enters a recession?
c. Comparing your answers to (a) and (b), how would you measure the operating leverage of this firm?

1. Briefly discuss what actions the U.S. Federal Reserve would likely take in pursuing an expansionary monetary policy using each of the following three monetary tools: a. Reserve requirements.

$b$  . Open market operations.
c. Discount rate.

2. An unanticipated expansionary monetary policy has been implemented. Indicate the impact of this policy on each of the following four variables: a. Inflation rate.

$b$ . Real output and employment.
$c$ . Real interest rate.
$d$ . Nominal interest rate.

3. Universal Auto is a large multinational corporation headquartered in the United States. For segment reporting purposes, the company is engaged in two businesses: production of motor vehicles and information processing services.

The motor vehicle business is by far the larger of Universal's two segments. It consists mainly of domestic U.S. passenger car production, but it also includes small truck manufacturing operations in the United States and passenger car production in other countries. This segment of Universal has had weak operating results for the past several years, including a large loss in 2022. Although the company does not reveal the operating results of its domestic passenger car segments, that part of Universal's business is generally believed to be primarily responsible for the weak performance of its motor vehicle segment.

Idata, the information processing services segment of Universal, was started by Universal about 15 years ago. This business has shown strong, steady growth that has been entirely internal; no acquisitions have been made.

An excerpt from a research report on Universal prepared by Paul Adams, a CFA candidate, states: "Based on our assumption that Universal will be able to increase prices significantly on U.S. passenger cars in 2023, we project a multibillion dollar profit improvement."

$a$ . Discuss the concept of an industrial life cycle by describing each of its four phases.
$b$ . Identify where each of Universal's two primary businesses—passenger cars and information processing—is in such a cycle.
c. Discuss how product pricing should differ between Universal's two businesses, based on the location of each in the industrial life cycle.

4. Adams's research report (see CFA Problem 3) continued as follows: "With a business recovery already under way, the expected profit surge should lead to a much higher price for Universal Auto stock. We strongly recommend purchase."

a. Discuss the business cycle approach to investment timing. (Your answer should describe actions to be taken on both stocks and bonds at different points over a typical business cycle.) b. Assuming Adams's assertion is correct (that a business recovery is already under way), evaluate the timeliness of his recommendation to purchase Universal Auto, a cyclical stock, based on the business cycle approach to investment timing.

5. Janet Ludlow is preparing a report on U.S.-based manufacturers in the electric toothbrush industry and has gathered the information shown in Tables 17B and 17C. Ludlow's report concludes that the electric toothbrush industry is in the maturity (i.e., late) phase of its industry life cycle.

Ratios for electric toothbrush industry index and broad stock market index

- Industry Sales Growth—Industry sales have grown at  $15 - 20\%$  per year in recent years and are expected to grow at  $10 - 15\%$  per year over the next 3 years.
Non-U.S. Markets—Some U.S. manufacturers are attempting to enter fast-growing non-U.S. markets, which remain largely unexploited.
- Mail Order Sales—Some manufacturers have created a new niche in the industry by selling electric toothbrushes directly to customers through mail order. Sales for this industry segment are growing at  $40\%$  per year.
U.S. Market Penetration—The current penetration rate in the United States is  $60\%$  of households and will be difficult to increase.
- Price Competition—Manufacturers compete fiercely on the basis of price, and price wars within the industry are common.
- Niche Markets—Some manufacturers are able to develop new, unexploited niche markets in the United States based on company reputation, quality, and service.
- Industry Consolidation—Several manufacturers have recently merged, and it is expected that consolidation in the industry will increase.
- New Entrants-New manufacturers continue to enter the market.

6. As a securities analyst, you have been asked to review a valuation of a closely held business, Wigwam Autoparts Heaven, Inc. (WAH), prepared by the Red Rocks Group (RRG). You are asked to give an opinion on the valuation and to support your opinion by analyzing each part of the valuation. WAH's sole business is automotive parts retailing. The RRG valuation includes a section called "Analysis of the Retail Autoparts Industry," based completely on the data in Table 17D and the following additional information:

- WAH and its principal competitors each operated more than 150 stores at year-end 2022.
- The average number of stores operated per company engaged in the retail autoparts industry is 5.3.
- The major customer base for autoparts sold in retail stores consists of young owners of old vehicles. These owners do their own automotive maintenance out of economic necessity.

a. One of RRG's conclusions is that the retail autoparts industry as a whole is in the maturity stage of the industry life cycle. Discuss three relevant items of data from Table 17D that support this conclusion.
b. Another RRG conclusion is that WAH and its principal competitors are in the consolidation stage of their life cycle.

i. Cite three relevant items of data from Table 17D that support this conclusion.
ii. Explain how WAH and its principal competitors can be in a consolidation stage while their industry as a whole is in the maturity stage.

7. a. If the exchange rate for the British pound goes from U.S.$1.45 to U.S.$1.25, then the pound has: i. Appreciated and the British will find U.S. goods cheaper.

ii. Appreciated and the British will find U.S. goods more expensive.
iii. Depreciated and the British will find U.S. goods more expensive.
iv. Depreciated and the British will find U.S. goods cheaper.

$b$ . Changes in which of the following are likely to affect interest rates?

i. Inflation expectations.
ii. Size of the federal deficit.
iii. Money supply.

c. According to the supply-side view of fiscal policy, if the impact on total tax revenues is the same, does it make any difference whether the government cuts taxes by either reducing marginal tax rates or increasing the personal exemption allowance?

i. No, both methods of cutting taxes will exert the same impact on aggregate supply.
ii. No, people in both cases will increase their saving, expecting higher future taxes, and thereby offset the stimulus effect of lower current taxes.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. The downturn in the auto industry will reduce the demand for the product of this economy. The economy will, at least in the short term, enter a recession. This would suggest that: a. GDP will fall.

$b$ . The unemployment rate will rise.
c. The government deficit will increase. Income tax receipts will fall, and government expenditures on social welfare programs probably will increase.
$d$ . Interest rates should fall. The contraction in the economy will reduce the demand for credit. Moreover, the lower inflation rate will reduce nominal interest rates.

2. Expansionary fiscal policy coupled with expansionary monetary policy will stimulate the economy, with the loose monetary policy keeping down interest rates.
3. A traditional demand-side interpretation of the tax cuts is that the resulting increase in after-tax income increased consumption demand and stimulated the economy. A supply-side interpretation is that the reduction in marginal tax rates made it more attractive for businesses to invest and for individuals to work, thereby increasing economic output.
4. Firm C has the lowest fixed cost and highest variable costs. It should be least sensitive to the business cycle. In fact, it is. Its profits are highest of the three firms in recessions but lowest in expansions.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Recession</td><td>Normal</td><td>Expansion</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue</td><td>$10</td><td>$12</td><td>\$14</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed cost</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Variable cost</td><td>7.5</td><td>9</td><td>10.5</td></tr><tr><td>Profits</td><td>$ 0.5</td><td>$ 1</td><td>\$ 1.5</td></tr></table>

5.  $a$ . Newspapers will do best in an expansion when advertising volume is increasing.

b. Machine tools are a good investment at the trough of a recession, just as the economy is about to enter an expansion and firms may need to increase capacity.
c. Beverages are defensive investments, with demand that is relatively insensitive to the business cycle. Therefore, they are relatively attractive investments if a recession is forecast.
$d$ . Timber is a good investment at a peak period, when natural resource prices are high and the economy is operating at full capacity.

# Equity Valuation Models

# 18

AS OUR DISCUSSION of market efficiency indicated, finding undervalued securities will never be easy. Still, there are enough chinks in the armor of the efficient market hypothesis that the search for such securities should not be dismissed out of hand. Moreover, it is the ongoing search for mispriced securities that maintains a nearly efficient market. Even minor mispricing would allow stock market analysts to earn their salary.

This chapter describes the valuation models that stock market analysts use to uncover mispriced securities. The models presented are the go-to tools used by fundamental analysts, those who use information concerning the current and prospective profitability of a company to assess its fair market value. We start with a discussion of alternative measures of the value of a company. From there, we progress to quantitative tools called dividend discount models, used to estimate the value of a firm as an ongoing concern. Next we turn to price-earnings, or P/E, ratios, explaining why they are of such interest to analysts but also highlighting some of their shortcomings. We explain how P/E ratios are tied to dividend valuation models and, more generally, to the growth prospects of the firm.


We close the chapter with a discussion and extended example of free cash flow models used by analysts to value firms based on forecasts of the cash flows that will be generated from the firms' business endeavors. Finally, we apply the several valuation tools covered in the chapter to a real firm and find some disparity in their conclusions—a conundrum that will confront any security analyst—and consider reasons for these discrepancies.

# 18.1 Valuation by Comparables

The purpose of fundamental analysis is to identify stocks that are mispriced relative to some measure of "true" or intrinsic value that can be derived from observable financial data. There are many convenient sources of relevant data. For U.S. companies, the Securities and Exchange Commission provides information at its EDGAR Web site, www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. The SEC requires all public companies (except foreign companies and companies with less than 10 million in assets and 500 shareholders) to file registration statements, periodic reports, and other forms electronically through EDGAR. Anyone can access and download this information. Many Web sites such as finance.yahoo.com, money.msn.com, or finance.google.com also provide analysis and data derived from the EDGAR reports.


Table 18.1 shows some financial highlights for Microsoft as well as some comparable data for other firms in the software applications industry. The price per share of Microsoft's common stock is  \$287.12, and the total market value or capitalization of those shares (called market cap for short) is\$ 2,157 billion. Under the heading "Valuation," Table 18.1 shows the ratio of Microsoft's stock price to several benchmarks. Its share price is 35.66 times its (per-share) earnings in the most recent 12 months, 15.20 times its recent book value, and 13 times its sales. The last valuation ratio, PEG, is the P/E ratio divided by the growth rate of earnings. We would expect more rapidly growing firms to sell at higher multiples of current earnings (more on this below), so PEG normalizes the P/E ratio by the growth rate.

These valuation ratios are commonly used to assess the valuation of one firm compared to others in the same industry, and we will consider all of them. The column to the right gives comparable ratios for other firms in the software applications industry. For example, an analyst might note that Microsoft's price/earnings ratio is below the industry average. However, its ratio of market value to book value, the net worth of the company as reported on the balance sheet, as well as its price-to-sales and PEG ratios, are above industry norms. Clearly, rigorous valuation models will be necessary to sort through these conflicting signals of value.

# Limitations of Book Value

Shareholders in a firm are sometimes called "residual claimants," which means that the value of their stake is what is left over when the liabilities of the firm are subtracted

Shareholders' equity is this net worth. However, the values of both assets and liabilities recognized in financial statements are based on historical—not current—values. For example, the book value of an asset equals the original cost of acquisition less some adjustment for depreciation, even if the market price of that asset has changed over time. Moreover, depreciation allowances reflect the original cost of the asset rather than loss of actual value.

Whereas book values are based on historical cost, market values measure the current values of assets and liabilities. The market value of the shareholders' equity investment equals the difference between the current values of all assets and liabilities. These values generally will not match historical ones. Equally or even more important, many assets, such as the value of a good brand name or specialized expertise developed over many years, may not even be included on the financial statements, but they certainly influence market price. Market prices reflect the value of the firm as a going concern.

Can book value represent a "floor" for the stock's price, below which level the market price can never fall? Although Microsoft's book value per share in 2021 was far less than its market price, other evidence disproves this notion. While it is not common, there are always some firms selling at a market price below book value. In 2022, for example, such unfortunate firms included Honda, Mitsubishi, and Citigroup.

A better measure of a floor for the stock price is the firm's liquidation value per share. This is the amount of money that could be realized by breaking up the firm, selling its assets, repaying its debt, and distributing the remainder to the shareholders. If market capitalization drops below liquidation value, the firm becomes attractive as a takeover target. A corporate raider would find it profitable to buy enough shares to gain control and then liquidate.

Another measure of firm value is the replacement cost of assets less liabilities. Some analysts believe the market value of the firm cannot remain for long too far above its replacement cost (sometimes called reproduction cost) because if it did, competitors would enter the market. The resulting competitive pressure would drive down profits and the market value of all firms until they fell to replacement cost.

This idea is popular among economists, and the ratio of market price to replacement cost is known as Tobin's  $q$ , after the Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin. In the long run, according to this view, the ratio of market price to replacement cost will tend toward 1, but the evidence is that this ratio can differ significantly from 1 for very long periods.

Although focusing on the balance sheet can give some useful information about a firm's liquidation value or its replacement cost, the analyst must usually turn to expected future cash flows for a better estimate of the firm's value as a going concern. We therefore turn to the quantitative models that analysts use to value common stock based on forecasts of future earnings and dividends.

# 18.2 Intrinsic Value versus Market Price

The most popular model for assessing the value of a firm as a going concern starts from the observation that an investor in stock expects a return consisting of cash dividends and capital gains or losses. We begin by assuming a 1-year holding period and supposing that ABC stock has an expected dividend per share,  $E(D_1)$ , of \$4; the current price of a share,  $P_0$ , is \$48; and the expected price at the end of a year,  $E(P_1)$ , is 52. For now, don't worry about how you derive your forecast of next year's price. At this point we ask only whether the stock seems attractively priced today given your forecast of next year's price.

The expected holding-period return is  $E(D_{1})$  plus the expected price appreciation,  $E(P_{1}) - P_{0}$ , all divided by the current price,  $P_{0}$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {E x p e c t e d H P R} = E (r) = \frac {E \left(D _ {1}\right) + \left[ E \left(P _ {1}\right) - P _ {0} \right]}{P _ {0}} \\ = \frac {4 + (52 - 48)}{48} = . 167, \text {or} 16.7 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus, the stock's expected holding-period return is the sum of the expected dividend yield,  $E(D_1) / P_0$ , and the expected rate of price appreciation, the capital gains yield,  $[E(P_1) - P_0] / P_0$ .

But what rate of return do investors require of ABC stock? The CAPM states that when stock market prices are at equilibrium levels, the expected rate of return is  $r_f + \beta [E(r_M) - r_f]$ . Thus, the CAPM may be viewed as providing an estimate of the rate of return an investor can reasonably expect to earn on a security given its risk as measured by beta. This is the return that investors will require of any other investment with equivalent risk. We will denote this required rate of return as  $k$ . If a stock is priced "correctly," it will offer investors a "fair" return, that is, its expected return will equal its required return. Of course, the goal of a security analyst is to find stocks that are mispriced. An underpriced stock will provide an expected return greater than the required return.

Suppose that  $r_f = 6\%$ ,  $E(r_M) - r_f = 5\%$ , and the beta of ABC is 1.2. Then according to the CAPM, the value of  $k$  is

$$ k = 6 \% +1.2\times 5 \% = 12 \%
$$

The expected holding-period return on ABC,  $16.7\%$ , therefore exceeds the required rate of return by a margin of  $4.7\%$ . Naturally, the investor will want to include more of ABC stock in the portfolio than a passive strategy would indicate.

Another way to see this is to compare the intrinsic value of a share to its market price. The intrinsic value, denoted  $V_{0}$ , is defined as the present value of all the cash flows the investor will receive (on a per-share basis), including dividends as well as the proceeds from the ultimate sale of the stock, discounted at the appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate,  $k$ . If the intrinsic value, or the investor's own estimate of what the stock is really worth, exceeds the market price, the stock is considered undervalued and a good investment.

# Example 18.1 Price versus Intrinsic Value

For ABC, using a 1-year investment horizon and a forecast that the stock can be sold at the end of the year at price P_{1} = \52, the intrinsic value is

$$
V _ {0} = \frac {E (D _ {1}) + E (P _ {1})}{1 + k} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 4 + \mathbb {S} 5 2}{1 . 1 2} = \mathbb {S} 5 0
$$

Equivalently, at a price of 50, the stock would provide the investor a 12 \%expected rate of return—just equal to the required rate of return. However, the actual stock price, \$ 48, is less than intrinsic value. At this price, it provides better than a fair rate of return relative to its risk. Using the terminology of the CAPM, ABC is a positive- alpha stock, and investors will want to buy more of it than they would following a passive strategy.

Symmetrically, if the intrinsic value turns out to be less than the current market price, investors should buy less of it than under the passive strategy. It might even pay to go short on ABC stock, as we discussed in Chapter 3.

In equilibrium, the market price will reflect the intrinsic value estimates of all market participants. This means the individual investor whose  $V_{0}$  estimate differs from the market price,  $P_{0}$ , in effect must disagree with some or all of the consensus estimates of  $E(D_{1})$ ,  $E(P_{1})$ , or  $k$ . A common term for the consensus value of the required rate of return,  $k$ , is the market capitalization rate.

# 18.3 Dividend Discount Models

Consider an investor who buys a share of Steady State Electronics stock, planning to hold it for one year. The intrinsic value of the share is the present value of the dividend to be received at the end of the first year,  $D_{1}$ , and the expected sales price,  $P_{1}$ . We will henceforth use the simpler notation  $P_{1}$  instead of  $E(P_{1})$  to avoid clutter. Keep in mind, though, that future prices and dividends are unknown, and we are dealing with expected, not certain, values. We've already established

$$
V _ {0} = \frac {D _ {1} + P _ {1}}{1 + k} \tag {18.1}
$$

Although this year's dividends are fairly predictable given a company's history, you might ask how we can estimate  $P_{1}$ , the year-end price. According to Equation 18.1,  $V_{1}$  (the year-end intrinsic value) will be

$$
V _ {1} = \frac {D _ {2} + P _ {2}}{1 + k}
$$

If we assume the stock will be selling for its intrinsic value next year, then  $V_{1} = P_{1}$ , and we can substitute this value for  $P_{1}$  into Equation 18.1 to find

$$
V _ {0} = \frac {D _ {1}}{1 + k} + \frac {D _ {2} + P _ {2}}{(1 + k) ^ {2}}
$$

This equation may be interpreted as the present value of dividends plus sales price for a 2-year holding period. Of course, now we need to come up with a forecast of  $P_{2}$ . Continuing in the same way, we can replace  $P_{2}$  by  $(D_{3} + P_{3}) / (1 + k)$ , which relates  $P_{0}$  to the value of dividends plus the expected sales price for a 3-year holding period.

More generally, for a holding period of  $H$  years, we can write the stock value as the present value of dividends over the  $H$  years, plus the ultimate sale price,  $P_{H}$ :

$$
V _ {0} = \frac {D _ {1}}{1 + k} + \frac {D _ {2}}{(1 + k) ^ {2}} + \dots + \frac {D _ {H} + P _ {H}}{(1 + k) ^ {H}} \tag {18.2}
$$

Notice the similarity between this formula and the bond valuation formula we encountered in Chapter 14. Each relates price to the present value of a stream of payments (coupons in the case of bonds, dividends in the case of stocks) and a final payment (the face value of the bond, or the sales price of the stock). The key differences for stocks are the uncertainty of dividends, the lack of a fixed maturity date, and the unknown sales price at the horizon date. Indeed, one can continue to substitute for price indefinitely, to conclude

$$
V _ {0} = \frac {D _ {1}}{1 + k} + \frac {D _ {2}}{(1 + k) ^ {2}} + \frac {D _ {3}}{(1 + k) ^ {3}} + \dots \tag {18.3}
$$

Equation 18.3 states that the stock price should equal the present value of all expected future dividends into perpetuity. This formula is called the dividend discount model (DDM) of stock prices.

It is tempting, but incorrect, to interpret Equation 18.3 as saying that the DDM focuses exclusively on dividends and ignores capital gains as a motive for investing in stock. Indeed, we assume explicitly in Equation 18.1 that capital gains (as reflected in the expected sales price,  $P_{1}$ ) are part of the stock's value. The reason only dividends appear in Equation 18.3 is not that investors ignore capital gains. It is instead that those capital gains will reflect dividend forecasts at the time the stock is sold. That is why in Equation 18.2 we can write the stock price as the present value of dividends plus sales price for any horizon date.  $P_{H}$  is the present value at time  $H$  of all dividends expected to be paid after the horizon date. That value is then discounted back to today, time 0. The DDM asserts that stock prices are determined ultimately by the cash flows accruing to stockholders, and those are dividends.

# The Constant-Growth DDM

Equation 18.3 as it stands is still not very useful because it requires dividend forecasts for every year into the indefinite future. To make the DDM practical, we need some simplifying assumptions. A useful and common first pass is to assume that dividends are trending upward at a stable growth rate that we will call  $g$ . For example, if  $g = .05$ , and the most recently paid dividend was  $D_0 = 3.81$ , expected future dividends are

$$
\begin{array}{l} D _ {1} = D _ {0} (1 + g) = 3. 8 1 \times 1. 0 5 = 4. 0 0 \\ D _ {2} = D _ {0} (1 + g) ^ {2} = 3. 8 1 \times (1. 0 5) ^ {2} = 4. 2 0 \\ D _ {3} = D _ {0} (1 + g) ^ {3} = 3. 8 1 \times (1. 0 5) ^ {3} = 4. 4 1 \\ \end{array}
$$ and so on. Assuming constant growth in Equation 18.3, we can write intrinsic value as


$$
V _ {0} = \frac {D _ {0} (1 + g)}{1 + k} + \frac {D _ {0} (1 + g) ^ {2}}{(1 + k) ^ {2}} + \frac {D _ {0} (1 + g) ^ {3}}{(1 + k) ^ {3}} + \dots
$$

This equation can be simplified to

$$
V _ {0} = \frac {D _ {0} (1 + g)}{k - g} = \frac {D _ {1}}{k - g} \tag {18.4}
$$

Notice that we calculate intrinsic value by dividing  $D_{1}$  (not  $D_{0}$ ) by  $k - g$ . If the market capitalization rate for Steady State is  $12\%$ , the intrinsic value of a share of Steady State stock is

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 3 . 8 1 (1 + . 0 5)}{\cdot 1 2 - . 0 5} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 4 . 0 0}{\cdot 1 2 - . 0 5} = \mathbb {S} 5 7. 1 4
$$

Equation 18.4 is called the constant-growth DDM, or the Gordon model, after Myron Gordon, who popularized it. It should remind you of the formula for the present value of a perpetuity. If dividends were expected not to grow, then the dividend stream would be a simple perpetuity, and the valuation formula would be  $V_{0} = D_{1} / k$ . Equation 18.4 generalizes the perpetuity formula for the case of a growing perpetuity. For any given value of  $D_{1}$ , as  $g$  increases, the stock price also rises.

# Example 18.2 Preferred Stock and the DDM

Preferred stock that pays a fixed dividend can be valued using the constant-growth dividend discount model. The growth rate of dividends is simply zero. For example, to value a preferred stock paying a fixed dividend of 2 per share when the discount rate is 8\%, we compute

$$
V _ {0} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 2}{. 0 8 - 0} = \mathbb {S} 2 5
$$

Here is a proof. By definition,

$$
V _ {0} = \frac {D _ {1}}{1 + k} + \frac {D _ {1} (1 + g)}{(1 + k) ^ {2}} + \frac {D _ {1} (1 + g) ^ {2}}{(1 + k) ^ {3}} + \dots \tag {a}
$$

Multiplying through by  $(1 + k) / (1 + g)$ , we obtain

$$
\frac {(1 + k)}{(1 + g)} V _ {0} = \frac {D _ {1}}{(1 + g)} + \frac {D _ {1}}{(1 + k)} + \frac {D _ {1} (1 + g)}{(1 + k) ^ {2}} + \dots \tag {b}
$$

Subtracting equation (a) from equation (b), we find that

$$
\frac {1 + k}{1 + g} V _ {0} - V _ {0} = \frac {D _ {1}}{(1 + g)}
$$ which implies


$$
\frac {(k - g) V _ {0}}{(1 + g)} = \frac {D _ {1}}{(1 + g)}
$$

$$
V _ {0} = \frac {D _ {1}}{k - g}
$$

Recall from introductory finance that the present value of a \$1-per-year perpetuity is 1/k. For example, if k = 10\%, the value of the perpetuity is \$1/.10 = 10. Notice that if g = 0 in Equation 18.4, the constant-growth DDM formula is the same as the perpetuity formula.

# Example 18.3 The Constant-Growth DDM

High Flyer Industries has just paid its annual dividend of 3 per share. The dividend is expected to grow at a constant rate of 8 \% indefinitely. The beta of High Flyer stock is 1.0, the risk-free rate is 6 \%, and the market risk premium is 8 \%. What is the intrinsic value of the stock? What would be your estimate of intrinsic value if you believed that the stock was riskier, with a beta of 1.25?

Because a  \$3 dividend has just been paid and the growth rate of dividends is 8\%$ , the forecast for the year-end dividend is 3 \times 1.08 = $3.24. The market capitalization rate (using the CAPM) is  $6\% + 1.0 \times 8\% = 14\%$ . Therefore, the value of the stock is

$$
V _ {0} = \frac {D _ {1}}{k - g} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 3 . 2 4}{. 1 4 -. 0 8} = \mathbb {S} 5 4
$$

If the stock is perceived to be riskier, its value must be lower. At the higher beta, the market capitalization rate is  $6\% + 1.25 \times 8\% = 16\%$ , and the stock is worth only

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 3 . 2 4}{. 1 6 -. 0 8} = \mathbb {S} 4 0. 5 0
$$

The constant-growth DDM is valid only when  $g$  is less than  $k$ . If dividends were expected to grow forever at a rate faster than  $k$ , the value of the stock would be infinite. If an analyst derives an estimate of  $g$  greater than  $k$ , that growth rate must be unsustainable in the long run. The appropriate valuation model to use in this case is a multistage DDM such as those discussed below.

The constant-growth DDM is so widely used by stock market analysts that it is worth exploring some of its implications and limitations. The constant-growth rate DDM implies that a stock's value will be greater:

1. The larger its expected dividend per share.
2. The lower the market capitalization rate,  $k$ .
3. The higher the expected growth rate of dividends.

Another implication of the constant-growth model is that the stock price is expected to grow at the same rate as dividends. To see this, suppose Steady State stock is selling at its intrinsic value of \$57.14, so that  $V_{0} = P_{0}$ . Then

$$
P _ {0} = \frac {D _ {1}}{k - g}
$$

Notice that price is proportional to dividends. Therefore, next year, when the dividends paid to Steady State stockholders are expected to be higher by  $g = 5\%$ , price also should increase by  $5\%$ . To confirm this, we can write

$$
D _ {2} = \ 4 (1. 0 5) = \ 4. 2 0
$$

$$
P _ {1} = \frac {D _ {2}}{k - g} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 4 . 2 0}{. 1 2 -. 0 5} = \mathbb {S} 6 0. 0 0
$$ which is  $5\%$  higher than the current price of 57.14. To generalize,


$$
P _ {1} = \frac {D _ {2}}{k - g} = \frac {D _ {1} (1 + g)}{k - g} = \frac {D _ {1}}{k - g} (1 + g) = P _ {0} (1 + g)
$$

Therefore, the DDM implies that when dividends grow at a constant rate, the rate of price appreciation in any year will equal that growth rate,  $g$ . For a stock whose market price equals its intrinsic value  $(V_0 = P_0)$ , the expected holding-period return will be

$$
\begin{array}{l} E (r) = \text {D i v i d e n d y i e l d} + \text {C a p i t a l g a i n s y i e l d} \\ = \frac {D _ {1}}{P _ {0}} + \frac {P _ {1} - P _ {0}}{P _ {0}} = \frac {D _ {1}}{P _ {0}} + g \tag {18.5} \\ \end{array}
$$

This formula allows us to infer the market capitalization rate, for if the stock is selling at its intrinsic value, then  $E(r) = k$ , implying that  $k = D_{1} / P_{0} + g$ . By observing the dividend yield,  $D_{1} / P_{0}$ , and estimating the (assumed steady) growth rate of dividends, we can compute  $k$ . This equation is also known as the discounted cash flow (DCF) formula.

This approach is often used in rate hearings for regulated public utilities. The regulatory agency responsible for approving utility pricing decisions is mandated to allow the firms to charge just enough to cover costs plus a "fair" profit, that is, one that allows a competitive return on the investment the firm has made in its productive capacity. In turn, that return is taken to be the expected return investors require on the stock of the firm. The  $D_{1} / P_{0} + g$  formula allows us to infer that required return.

# Example 18.4 The Constant-Growth Model

Suppose that Steady State Electronics wins a major contract for its new computer chip. The very profitable contract will enable it to increase the growth rate of dividends from  $5 \%$ to  $6 \%$ without reducing the current dividend from the projected value of 4.00 per share. What will happen to the stock price? What will happen to future expected rates of return on the stock?

The stock price ought to increase in response to the good news about the contract, and indeed it does. The stock price jumps from its original value of 57.14 to a post-announcement price of

$$
\frac {D _ {1}}{k - g} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 4 . 0 0}{. 1 2 -. 0 6} = \mathbb {S} 6 6. 6 7
$$

Investors who are holding the stock when the good news about the contract is announced will receive a substantial windfall.

On the other hand, at the new price, the expected rate of return on the stock is  $12\%$ , just as it was before the new contract was announced:

$$
E (r) = \frac {D _ {1}}{P _ {0}} + g = \frac {\mathbb {S} 4.00}{\mathbb {S} 66.67} + . 06 = . 12, \text {or} 12 \%
$$

This makes sense. Once the news about the contract is reflected in the stock price, the expected rate of return will be consistent with the risk of the stock. Because that risk has not changed, neither should the expected rate of return.

# Concept Check 18.2 a. IBX's stock dividend at the end of this year is expected to be 2.15, and it is expected to grow at 11.2\% per year forever. If the required rate of return on IBX stock is 15.2\% per year, what is its intrinsic value?

b. If IBX's current market price equals this intrinsic value, what is next year's expected price?
c. If an investor buys IBX stock now and plans to sell it after receiving the 2.15 dividend a year from now, what is the expected capital gain (i.e., price appreciation) in percentage terms? What are the dividend yield and the expected holding-period return?

# Convergence of Price to Intrinsic Value

Suppose that the current market price of ABC stock from Example 18.1 is only  \$48 per share and, therefore, that the stock is undervalued by\$ 2 per share. In this case, the expected rate of price appreciation depends on an additional assumption about whether the discrepancy between the intrinsic value and the market price will disappear, and if so, when.

One fairly common assumption is that the discrepancy will never disappear and that the market price will trend upward at rate  $g$  forever. This implies that the discrepancy between intrinsic value and market price also will grow at the same rate. In our example:

<table><tr><td>Now</td><td>Next Year</td></tr><tr><td>V0 = $50</td><td>V1 = $50 × 1.04 = $52</td></tr><tr><td>P0 = $48</td><td>P1 = $48 × 1.04 = $49.92</td></tr><tr><td>V0 - P0 = $2</td><td>V1 - P1 = $2 × 1.04 = 2.08</td></tr></table>

Under this assumption, the expected HPR will exceed the required rate because the dividend yield is higher than it would be if  $P_0$  were equal to  $V_0$ . In our example, the dividend yield would be  $8.33\%$  instead of  $8\%$ , so the expected HPR would be  $12.33\%$  rather than  $12\%$ :

$$
E (r) = \frac {D _ {1}}{P _ {0}} + g = \frac {\mathbb {S} 4}{\mathbb {S} 4 8} +. 0 4 = . 0 8 3 3 +. 0 4 = . 1 2 3 3
$$

An investor who identifies this undervalued stock can get an expected dividend that exceeds the required yield by 33 basis points. This excess return is earned each year, and the market price never catches up to intrinsic value.

An alternative assumption is that the gap between market price and intrinsic value will disappear by the end of the year. In that case, we would have  $P_{1} = V_{1} = \$ 52$ , and

$$
E (r) = \frac {D _ {1}}{P _ {0}} + \frac {P _ {1} - P _ {0}}{P _ {0}} = \frac {4}{4 8} + \frac {5 2 - 4 8}{4 8} = . 0 8 3 3 +. 0 8 3 3 =. 1 6 6 7
$$

The assumption of complete catch-up to intrinsic value produces a much larger 1-year HPR. In future years, however, the stock is expected to generate only fair rates of return.

Many stock analysts assume that a stock's price will approach its intrinsic value gradually over time—for example, over a 5-year period. This puts their expected 1-year HPR somewhere between the bounds of  $12.33\%$  and  $16.67\%$ .

# Stock Prices and Investment Opportunities

Consider two companies, Cash Cow, Inc., and Growth Prospects, each with expected earnings in the coming year of  \$5 per share. Both companies could, in principle, pay out all of these earnings as dividends, maintaining a perpetual dividend flow of\$ 5 per share. If the market capitalization rate were  $k = 12.5\%$ , both companies would then be valued at  $D_{1} / k =$ 5/.125 = 40 per share. Neither firm would grow because, with all earnings paid out as dividends, and none reinvested in the firm, both companies' capital stock and earnings capacity would remain unchanged over time; neither earnings nor dividends would increase.

Now suppose one of the firms, Growth Prospects, engages in projects that generate a return on investment of  $15\%$ , which is greater than the required rate of return,  $k = 12.5\%$ . It would be foolish for such a company to pay out all of its earnings as dividends. If Growth Prospects retains or plows back some of its earnings into its profitable projects, it can earn a  $15\%$  rate of return for its shareholders, whereas if it pays out all earnings as dividends, it forgoes the projects, leaving shareholders to invest the dividends in other opportunities at an expected rate of only  $12.5\%$ . Suppose, therefore, that Growth Prospects chooses a lower dividend payout ratio (the fraction of earnings paid out as dividends), reducing payout from  $100\%$  to  $40\%$ , maintaining a plowback ratio (the fraction of earnings reinvested in the firm) at  $60\%$ . The plowback ratio is also referred to as the earnings retention ratio.

Figure 18.1 Dividend growth for two earnings reinvestment policies

The dividend of the company, therefore, will be 2 (40\% of 5 earnings) instead of 5. Will share price fall? No—it will rise! Although dividends initially fall under the earnings reinvestment policy, subsequent growth in the assets of the firm because of reinvested profits will generate growth in future dividends, which will be reflected in today's share price.

Figure 18.1 illustrates the dividend streams generated by Growth Prospects under two dividend policies. A low-reinvestment-rate plan allows the firm to pay higher initial dividends but results in a lower dividend growth rate. Eventually, a high-reinvestment-rate plan will provide higher dividends. If the dividend growth generated by the reinvested earnings is high enough, the stock will be worth more under the high-reinvestment strategy.

How much growth will be generated? Suppose Growth Prospects starts with plant and equipment of 100 million and is all equity financed. With a return on investment or equity (ROE) of 15\%, total earnings are ROE \times 100 million = .15 \times 100 million = \$15 million. There are 3 million shares of stock outstanding, so earnings per share are \$5, as posited above. If 60\% of the $15 million in this year's earnings is reinvested, then the value of the firm's assets will increase by .60 \times 15 million = $9 million, or by 9\%. The percentage increase in assets is the rate at which income was generated (ROE) times the plowback ratio (the fraction of earnings reinvested in the firm), which we will denote as b.

Now endowed with  $9\%$  more assets, the company earns  $9\%$  more income and pays out  $9\%$  higher dividends. The growth rate of the dividends, therefore, is

$$ g = \mathrm {R O E} \times b = . 1 5 \times . 6 0 = . 0 9
$$

For a given ROE and plowback ratio, the firm can grow at this rate indefinitely, so  $g$  is called the sustainable growth rate.

If the stock price equals its intrinsic value, and the ROE and payout ratios are consistent with the long-run capabilities of the firm, the stock should sell at

$$
P _ {0} = \frac {D _ {1}}{k - g} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 2}{. 1 2 5 -. 0 9} = \mathbb {S} 5 7. 1 4
$$

We can derive this relationship more generally by noting that with a fixed ROE, earnings (which equal ROE × book value) will grow at the same rate as the book value of the firm. Abstracting from issuance of new shares of stock, the growth rate of book value equals reinvested earnings/book value. Therefore,

$$ g = \frac {\text {R e i n v e s t e d e a r n i n g s}}{\text {B o o k v a l u e}} = \frac {\text {R e i n v e s t e d e a r n i n g s}}{\text {T o t a l e a r n i n g s}} \times \frac {\text {T o t a l e a r n i n g s}}{\text {B o o k v a l u e}} = b \times \text {R O E}
$$

When Growth Prospects pursued a no-growth policy and paid out all earnings as dividends, the stock price was only \$40. Therefore, you can think of \$40 as the value per share of the assets the company already has in place.

When Growth Prospects decided to reduce current dividends and reinvest some of its earnings in new investments, its stock price increased. The increase in the stock price reflects the fact that the planned investments provide an expected rate of return greater than the required rate. In other words, the investment opportunities have positive net present value, and the value of the firm rises by that NPV. This net present value is also called the present value of growth opportunities, or PVGO.

Therefore, we can think of the value of the firm as the sum of the value of assets already in place, or the no-growth value of the firm, plus the net present value of the future investments the firm will make, which is the PVGO. For Growth Prospects, PVGO = 17.14 per share:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {P r i c e} = \text {N o - g r o w t h v a l u e p e r s h a r e} + \text {P V G O} \\ P _ {0} = \frac {E _ {1}}{k} + \text {P V G O} \tag {18.6} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
5 7. 1 4 = 4 0 + 1 7. 1 4
$$

We know that, in reality, dividend cuts almost always are accompanied by drops in stock prices. Does this contradict our analysis? Not necessarily: Dividend cuts are usually taken as bad news about the future prospects of the firm, and it is the new information about the firm—not the reduced dividend per se—that is responsible for the stock price decline.

For example, when J.P. Morgan cut its quarterly dividend from 38 cents to 5 cents a share in 2009, its stock price actually increased by about  $5\%$ . The company was able to convince investors that the cut would conserve cash and prepare the firm to weather the imminent recession. When investors were convinced that the dividend cut made sense, the stock price actually increased. Similarly, when Boeing announced in March 2020 that it would suspend dividends, its stock price barely budged. Investors already knew that the COVID-19 pandemic had severely impaired Boeing's profitability. The cut already had been widely anticipated, so it was not new information. These examples show that stock price declines in response to dividend cuts are really a response to the information conveyed by the cut.

It is important to recognize that growth per se is not what investors desire. Growth enhances value only if it is achieved by investment in projects with attractive profit opportunities (i.e., with ROE > k). To see why, let's now consider Growth Prospects's unfortunate sister company, Cash Cow, Inc. Cash Cow's ROE is only 12.5\%, just equal to the required rate of return, k. Therefore, the net present value of its investment opportunities is zero. We've seen that following a zero-growth strategy with b = 0 and g = 0, the value of Cash Cow will be E₁/k = $5/.125 = $40 per share. Now suppose Cash Cow chooses a plowback ratio of b = .60, the same as Growth Prospects's plowback. Then g would increase to

$$ g = \mathrm {R O E} \times b = . 1 2 5 \times . 6 0 = . 0 7 5
$$

But the stock price is still 40:

$$
P _ {0} = \frac {D _ {1}}{k - g} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 2}{. 1 2 5 -. 0 7 5} = \mathbb {S} 4 0
$$ which is no different from the no-growth strategy.


When Cash Cow reduced dividends to free funds for reinvestment, it generated only enough growth to maintain the stock price at its current level. This makes sense: If the firm's projects yield only what investors can earn on their own, shareholders cannot be made better off by a high-reinvestment-rate policy. This demonstrates that "growth" is not the same as growth opportunities. To justify reinvestment, the firm must engage in projects with better prospective returns than those shareholders can find elsewhere. Notice also that the PVGO of Cash Cow is zero:  $\mathrm{PVGO} = P_0 - E_1 / k = 40 - 40 = 0$ . With ROE = k, there is no gain from plowing funds back into the firm. In fact, this is why firms with considerable cash flow but limited investment prospects are called "cash cows." The cash these firms generate is best taken out of, or "milked from," the firm.


# Example 18.5 Growth Opportunities

Takeover Target is run by entrenched management that stubbornly insists on reinvesting 60\% of its earnings in projects that provide an ROE of 10\%, despite the fact that the firm's capitalization rate is k = 15\%. The firm's year-end dividend will be \$2 per share, paid out of earnings of \$5 per share. At what price will the stock sell? What is the present value of growth opportunities? Why would such a firm be a takeover target for another firm?

Given current management's investment policy, the dividend growth rate will be

$$ g = R O E \times b = 10 \% \times .60 = 6 \%
$$ and the stock price should be


$$
P _ {0} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 2}{. 1 5 -. 0 6} = \mathbb {S} 2 2. 2 2
$$

The present value of growth opportunities is

$$
\begin{array}{l} P V G O = \text {P r i c e p e r s h a r e - N o - g r o w t h v a l u e p e r s h a r e} \\ = \mathbb {S} 2 2. 2 2 - E _ {1} / k = \mathbb {S} 2 2. 2 2 - 5. 1 5 = - \mathbb {S} 1 1. 1 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

PVGO is negative. This is because the net present value of the firm's projects is negative: The rate of return on those assets is less than the opportunity cost of capital.

Such a firm would be vulnerable to takeover because another firm could buy the firm for the market price of 22.22 per share and increase the value of the firm by changing its investment policy. For example, if the new management simply paid out all earnings as dividends, the value of the firm would increase to its no-growth value, E_{1} / k = \5/.15 = \$33.33.

# Concept Check 18.3 a. Calculate the price of a firm with a plowback ratio of .60 if its ROE is  $20\%$ ; the coming year's earnings,  $E_{1}$ , will be \$5 per share; and  $k = 12.5\%$ .

b. What if ROE is  $10\%$ , which is less than the market capitalization rate? Compare the firm's price in this instance to that of a firm with the same ROE and  $E_{1}$  but a plowback ratio of  $b = 0$ .

# Life Cycles and Multistage Growth Models

As useful as the constant-growth DDM formula is, you need to remember that it is based on a strong simplifying assumption, namely, that the dividend growth rate will be constant forever. In fact, firms typically pass through life cycles with very different dividend profiles in different phases. In early years, there are ample opportunities for profitable reinvestment in the company. Payout ratios are low, and growth is correspondingly rapid.

Eventually, the firm matures, production capacity is sufficient to meet market demand, competitors enter the market, and attractive opportunities for reinvestment may become harder to find. In this mature phase, with fewer investment opportunities, the firm may choose to pay out a higher fraction of earnings as dividends.

Table 18.2 illustrates this pattern. It gives Value Line's forecasts of return on capital, dividend payout ratio, and 3-year projected growth rate in earnings per share for a sample of the firms included in the computer software industry versus those of East Coast electric utilities. (We compare return on capital rather than return on equity because the latter is affected by leverage, which tends to be far greater in the electric utility industry than in the software industry. Return on capital measures operating income per dollar of total long-term financing, regardless of whether the source of the capital supplied is debt or equity. We will return to this issue in Chapter 19.)

By and large, the software firms have attractive investment opportunities. The median return on capital of these firms is forecast to be  $20.8\%$ , and the firms have responded with high plowback ratios. Some of these firms pay no dividends at all. The high return on capital and high plowback result in rapid growth. The median projected growth rate of earnings per share in this group is  $11.9\%$ .

In contrast, the electric utilities are more representative of mature firms. Their median return on capital is lower,  $6.0\%$ ; dividend payout is higher,  $64\%$ ; and median growth is lower,  $6.0\%$ . We conclude that the higher payouts of the electric utilities reflect their more limited opportunities to reinvest earnings at attractive rates of return.

To value companies with temporarily high growth, analysts use a multistage version of the dividend discount model. For example, a two-stage dividend discount model allows for an initial high-growth period before the firm settles down to a sustainable growth trajectory. The combined present value of dividends in the initial high-growth period is calculated first. Then, once the firm is projected to settle down to a steady-growth phase, the constant-growth DDM is applied to value the remaining stream of dividends.

Let's try this approach with an actual firm. Figure 18.2 is a Value Line Investment Survey report on Toyota. Even though the firm is based in Japan, U.S. investors can buy and sell American Depositary Receipts (see Chapter 2) on its shares. Some of its relevant information for 2021 is highlighted.

Toyota's beta appears at the circled A, its recent stock price at the B, the per-share dividend payments at the C, the ROE (referred to as return on shareholder equity) at the D, and the dividend payout ratio (referred to as all dividends to net profits) at the E. The rows ending at C, D, and E are historical time series. The boldfaced, italicized entries under 2022 are estimates for that year. Similarly, the entries in the far right column (labeled 24-26) are forecasts for some time between 2024 and 2026, which we will take to be 2025.

Value Line projects fairly rapid growth in the near term, with dividends increasing at about 7.6\% per year, from 4.45 in 2022 to 5.55 in 2025. This growth rate cannot be sustained indefinitely. We can obtain dividend inputs for this initial period by using the explicit forecasts for 2022 and 2025 and linear interpolation for the years between:

<table><tr><td>2022</td><td>$4.45</td><td>2024</td><td>$5.18</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>$4.81</td><td>2025</td><td>$5.55</td></tr></table>

Now let us assume the dividend growth rate levels off in 2025. What is a good guess for that steady-state growth rate? Value Line forecasts a dividend payout ratio of  $34\%$  and an ROE of  $9\%$ , implying long-term growth will be

$$ g = \mathrm {ROE} \times b = 9 \% \times (1 -.34) = 5.94 \%
$$ which Value Line rounds off to  $6\%$ .


Our estimate of Toyota's intrinsic value using an investment horizon of 2025 is therefore obtained from Equation 18.2, which we restate here:

$$
\begin{array}{l} V _ {2 0 2 1} = \frac {D _ {2 0 2 2}}{1 + k} + \frac {D _ {2 0 2 3}}{(1 + k) ^ {2}} + \frac {D _ {2 0 2 4}}{(1 + k) ^ {3}} + \frac {D _ {2 0 2 5} + P _ {2 0 2 5}}{(1 + k) ^ {4}} \\ = \frac {4 . 4 5}{1 + k} + \frac {4 . 8 1}{(1 + k) ^ {2}} + \frac {5 . 1 8}{(1 + k) ^ {3}} + \frac {5 . 5 5 + P _ {2 0 2 5}}{(1 + k) ^ {4}} \\ \end{array}
$$

Here,  $P_{2025}$  represents the forecast price at which we can sell our shares at the end of 2025, when dividends are assumed to enter their constant-growth phase. That price, according to the constant-growth DDM, should be

$$
P _ {2 0 2 5} = \frac {D _ {2 0 2 6}}{k - g} = \frac {D _ {2 0 2 5} (1 + g)}{k - g} = \frac {5 . 5 5 \times 1 . 0 6}{k - . 0 6}
$$

The only variable remaining to be determined to calculate intrinsic value is the market capitalization rate,  $k$ .

One way to obtain  $k$  is from the CAPM. Observe from the Value Line report that Toyota's beta is .80. The risk-free rate on long-term Treasury bonds in 2021 was about  $2\%$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/a56e2983bc830f3b019e71cb6d3257aa43c19d4547c87463a678a88fb7a1bba8.jpg)

Suppose that the market risk premium was forecast at  $8\%$ , roughly in line with its historical average. This would imply that the forecast for the market return was

$$
\text {Risk - free rate} + \text {Market risk premium} = 2 \% + 8 \% = 10 \%
$$

Therefore, we can solve for the market capitalization rate as

$$ k = r _ {f} + \beta [ E (r _ {M}) - r _ {f} ] = 2 \% + .8 \times (10 \% - 2 \%) = 8.4 \%
$$

Our forecast for the stock price in 2025 is thus

$$
P _ {2 0 2 5} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 5 . 5 5 \times 1 . 0 6}{. 0 8 4 -. 0 6} = \mathbb {S} 2 4 5. 1 3
$$ and today's estimate of intrinsic value is


$$
V _ {2 0 2 1} = \frac {4 . 4 5}{1 . 0 8 4} + \frac {4 . 8 1}{(1 . 0 8 4) ^ {2}} + \frac {5 . 1 8}{(1 . 0 8 4) ^ {3}} + \frac {5 . 5 5 + 2 4 5 . 1 3}{(1 . 0 8 4) ^ {4}} = \$ 1 9 3. 8 1
$$

We know from the Value Line report that Toyota's actual price was 152.23 (at the circled B). Our intrinsic value analysis indicates that the stock was considerably underpriced. Should we increase our holdings?

Perhaps. But before betting the farm, stop to consider how much confidence you should place in this estimate. We've had to guess at dividends in the near future, the appropriate discount rate, and the ultimate growth rate of those dividends. Moreover, we've assumed Toyota will follow a relatively simple two-stage growth process. In practice, the growth of dividends can follow more complicated patterns. Even small errors in these approximations could upset a conclusion.

In particular, it is clear that an overwhelming portion of Toyota's intrinsic value derives from the forecast 2025 sales price of 245.13. If that sales price is overstated, so will be our estimate of intrinsic value. And we have good reason to be skeptical, especially given a forecast terminal growth rate of 6\%. In light of the fact that the long-term real growth rate of the U.S. economy is typically estimated at only 2\% - 3\%, it seems unlikely that any firm can grow indefinitely at such a rate, even in nominal terms. Moreover, even small revisions to this estimate can have large impacts on the estimate of intrinsic value.

For example, suppose the actual growth rate in the post-2025 period will be  $5\%$ , roughly matching the nominal U.S. growth rate assuming a long-term inflation rate of  $2.5\%$ . Using this estimate in the two-stage dividend discount model reduces the estimate of intrinsic value to 140.42. Now Toyota appears a bit overpriced. Would you bet your career on a forecast of the post-2025 growth rate?

The exercise highlights the importance of performing sensitivity analysis. Your valuation can be no better than your assumptions. Sensitivity analysis will highlight the inputs that need to be most carefully examined. For example, even modest changes in the estimated growth rate for the post-2025 period result in big changes in intrinsic value. Similarly, small changes in the assumed capitalization rate would change intrinsic value substantially. On the other hand, reasonable changes in the dividends forecast between 2022 and 2025 would have a small impact on intrinsic value.

# Concept Check 18.4

Confirm that the intrinsic value of Toyota using  $g = 5 \%$  is  $\$ 140.42$ . (Hint: First calculate the stock price in 2025. Then calculate the present value of all interim dividends plus the present value of the 2025 sales price.)

# Multistage Growth Models

The two-stage growth model that we just considered is a good start toward realism, but clearly we can do even better by allowing our valuation model to accommodate more flexible patterns of growth. Multistage growth models allow dividends to grow at several different rates as the firm matures. Many analysts use three-stage growth models. They may assume an initial period of high dividend growth (or instead make year-by-year forecasts of dividends for the short term), a final period of sustainable growth, and a transition period between, during which dividend growth rates taper off from the initial rapid rate to the ultimate sustainable rate. These models are conceptually no harder to work with than a two-stage model, but they require many more calculations and can be tedious to do by hand. But they are tailor-made for Excel.

Spreadsheet 18.1 is an example of such a model. Column B contains the inputs we have used so far for Toyota. Column E contains dividend forecasts. In cells E2 through E5 we present the Value Line estimates for the next 4 years. Our estimate of Toyota's terminal growth rate from the two-stage model was  $9\% \times (1 - .34) = 5.94\%$ . But we noted that this rate seems too high to be sustained in perpetuity. Suppose again that a more plausible long-run nominal growth rate is  $5\%$ , roughly matching that of the overall economy. But now we assume that dividend growth declines linearly in a transition period from the  $7.6\%$  growth rate in the 3-year period ending in 2025 to an ultimate value of  $5\%$  in 2037 (see Column F).

Each dividend in the transition period is the previous year's dividend times that year's growth rate. Terminal value once the firm finally enters a constant-growth stage (cell G17) is computed from the constant-growth DDM. Investor cash flow in each period (column H) equals dividends in each year plus the terminal value in 2037. The present value of these cash flows is computed in cell H19 as 157.

# 18.4 The Price-Earnings Ratio

# The Price-Earnings Ratio and Growth Opportunities

Much of the real-world discussion of stock market valuation concentrates on the firm's price-earnings multiple, the ratio of price per share to earnings per share, commonly called the P/E ratio. Our discussion of growth opportunities shows why stock market analysts focus on the P/E ratio. Both Cash Cow and Growth Prospects had earnings per share (EPS) of 5, but Growth Prospects reinvested 60\% of earnings in projects with an ROE of 15\%, whereas Cash Cow paid out all earnings as dividends. Cash Cow had a price of \$40, giving it a P/E multiple of 40/5 = 8.0, whereas Growth Prospects sold for \$57.14, giving it a multiple of 57.14/5 = 11.4. This observation suggests the P/E ratio might reflect expected growth opportunities.

We can see how growth opportunities show up in P/E ratios by rearranging Equation 18.6 to

$$
\frac {P _ {0}}{E _ {1}} = \frac {1}{k} \left(1 + \frac {\text {P V G O}}{E / k}\right) \tag {18.7}
$$

When PVGO = 0, Equation 18.7 shows that  $P_0 = E_1 / k$ . The stock is valued like a non-growing perpetuity of  $E_1$ , and the P/E ratio is just  $1 / k$ . However, as PVGO becomes an increasingly dominant contributor to price, the P/E ratio can rise dramatically.

The ratio of PVGO to  $E / k$  has a straightforward interpretation. It is the ratio of the component of firm value due to growth opportunities to the component reflecting assets already in place (i.e., the no-growth value of the firm,  $E / k$ ). When future growth opportunities dominate the estimate of total value, the firm will command a high price relative to current earnings. Thus a high P/E multiple indicates that a firm enjoys ample growth opportunities.

# Example 18.6 Google's Growth Opportunities

Google (Alphabet) is already a highly profitable firm, but its forward P/E ratio of about 26.4 in early 2022 indicates that it still has substantial growth opportunities. If its market capitalization rate is about  $10\%$ , then we can use Equation 18.7 to infer the ratio of its growth opportunities to assets in place:

$$
\frac {P _ {0}}{E _ {1}} = \frac {1}{k} \left[ 1 + \frac {\mathrm {P V G O}}{E / k} \right] = \frac {1}{. 1 0} \left[ 1 + \frac {\mathrm {P V G O}}{\mathrm {P V (A s s e t s i n p l a c e)}} \right] = 2 6. 4
$$

We solve to show that PVGO/PV(Assets in place) = 1.64. So Google's anticipated future investment opportunities are valued by the market at about two-thirds its existing business.

P/E multiples do vary with growth prospects. Between 2001 and 2020, for example, PepsiCo's P/E ratio averaged about 20.6 while Consolidated Edison's (an electric utility) average P/E was only 15.7. These numbers do not necessarily imply that PepsiCo was overpriced compared to Con Ed. If investors believed PepsiCo would grow faster than Con Ed, the higher price per dollar of earnings would be justified. That is, investors might well pay a higher price per dollar of current earnings if they expect that earnings stream to grow more rapidly. In fact, PepsiCo's growth rate has been consistent with its higher P/E multiple. Over this period, its earnings per share more than tripled while Con Ed's increased by only  $23\%$ . (Later in the chapter, Figure 18.4 presents the EPS history of the two companies.)


We conclude that the P/E ratio reflects the market's optimism concerning a firm's growth prospects. Analysts must decide whether they are more or less optimistic than the belief implied by the market multiple. If they are more optimistic, they will recommend buying the stock.

There is a way to make these insights more precise. Look again at the constant-growth DDM formula,  $P_0 = D_1 / (k - g)$ . Now recall that dividends equal the earnings that are not reinvested in the firm:  $D_1 = E_1(1 - b)$ . Recall also that  $g = \mathrm{ROE} \times b$ . Hence, substituting for  $D_1$  and  $g$ , we find that

$$
P _ {0} = \frac {E _ {1} (1 - b)}{k - \mathrm {R O E} \times b}
$$ implying the P/E ratio is


$$
\frac {P _ {0}}{E _ {1}} = \frac {1 - b}{k - \mathrm {R O E} \times b} \tag {18.8}
$$

It is easy to verify that the P/E ratio increases with ROE. This makes sense because high-ROE projects give the firm good opportunities for growth. We also can verify that the P/E ratio increases for higher plowback,  $b$ , as long as ROE exceeds  $k$ . This too makes sense. When a firm has good investment opportunities, the market will reward it with a higher P/E multiple if it exploits those opportunities more aggressively by plowing back more earnings into those opportunities.

However, growth is not desirable for its own sake. Examine Table 18.3, where we use Equation 18.8 to compute both growth rates and P/E ratios for different combinations of ROE and  $b$ . Although growth always increases with the plowback ratio (move across the rows in Panel A), the P/E ratio does not (move across the rows in Panel B). In the top row of Panel B, the P/E falls as the plowback ratio increases. In the middle row, it is unaffected by plowback. In the third row, it increases.

This pattern has a simple interpretation. When the expected ROE is less than the required return,  $k$ , investors prefer that the firm pay out earnings as dividends rather than reinvest earnings in the firm at an inadequate rate of return. That is, for ROE lower than  $k$ , the value of the firm falls as plowback increases. Conversely, when ROE exceeds  $k$ , the firm offers attractive investment opportunities, so the value of the firm is enhanced as those opportunities are more fully exploited by increasing the plowback ratio.

# Table 18.3

Effect of ROE and plowback on growth and the P/E ratio

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="4">Plowback Ratio (b)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.75</td></tr><tr><td>ROE</td><td colspan="4">A.

Assumption:  $k = 12\%$  per year.

Finally, where ROE just equals  $k$ , the firm offers "break-even" investment opportunities with a fair rate of return. In this case, investors are indifferent between reinvestment of earnings in the firm or elsewhere at the market capitalization rate because the rate of return in either case is  $12\%$ . Therefore, the stock price is unaffected by the plowback ratio.

We conclude that the higher the plowback ratio, the higher the growth rate, but a higher plowback ratio does not necessarily mean a higher P/E ratio. Higher plowback increases P/E only if investments undertaken by the firm offer an expected rate of return greater than the market capitalization rate. Otherwise, increasing plowback hurts investors because more money is sunk into projects with inadequate rates of return.

Notwithstanding these fine points, P/E ratios frequently are taken as proxies for the expected growth in dividends or earnings. In fact, a Wall Street rule of thumb is that the growth rate ought to be roughly equal to the P/E ratio. In other words, the ratio of P/E to  $g$ , often called the PEG ratio, should be about 1.0. Peter Lynch, the famous portfolio manager, puts it this way in his book *One Up on Wall Street*:

The p/e ratio of any company that's fairly priced will equal its growth rate. I'm talking here about growth rate of earnings here. . . . If the p/e ratio of Coca Cola is 15, you'd expect the company to be growing at about  $15\%$  per year, etc. But if the p/e ratio is less than the growth rate, you may have found yourself a bargain. $^{8}$

# Example 18.7 P/E Ratio versus Growth Rate

Let's try Lynch's rule of thumb. Assume that

$r_f = 8\%$  (roughly the value when Peter Lynch was writing)

$r_{M} - r_{f} = 8\%$  (about the historical average market risk premium)

$b = .4$  (a typical value for the plowback ratio in the United States)

Therefore,  $r_{M} = r_{f} +$  market risk premium  $= 8\% + 8\% = 16\%$ , and  $k = 16\%$  for an average  $(\beta = 1)$  company. If we approximate ROE by  $16\%$  (the same value as the expected return on the stock), we conclude that

$$ g = \mathrm {ROE} \times b = 16 \% \times .4 = 6.4 \%
$$ and


$$
\frac {P}{E} = \frac {1 - . 4}{. 1 6 -. 0 6 4} = 6. 2 6
$$

Thus, the P/E ratio and  $g$  are about equal using these assumptions, consistent with the rule of thumb.

However, this rule of thumb, like almost all others, will not work in all circumstances. For example, the yield on long-term Treasury bonds today is more like  $2.0\%$ , so a comparable forecast of  $r_M$  would be

$$ r _ {f} + \text {Market risk premium} = 2.0 \% + 8 \% = 10.0 \%
$$

If we continue to focus on a firm with  $\beta = 1$ , and if ROE still is about the same as  $k$ , then

$$ g = 10.0\% \times .4 = 4.0\%
$$ while


$$
\frac {P}{E} = \frac {1 - . 4}{. 1 0 - . 0 4} = 1 0
$$

The P/E ratio and  $g$  now diverge and the PEG ratio is now 2.5. Nevertheless, lower-than-average PEG ratios are still widely seen as signaling potential underpricing.

The importance of growth opportunities is most evident in the valuation of start-up firms. For example, the market value of Tesla stock in 2021 was more than the combined value of Ford, GM, Honda, and Toyota. Yet its net income was less than one-tenth their combined income. The market was placing a huge value on Tesla's growth opportunities, reflecting in large part the competitive advantage it enjoyed from its big head start on electric cars and related battery technology.

Of course, when company valuation is determined primarily by growth opportunities, those values can be very sensitive to reassessments of such prospects. For example, when Meta Platforms (the parent company of Facebook) reduced its forecast of revenue growth and a decline in users on February 3, 2022, its share price dropped by  $26\%$  in one day. The company's market capitalization fell by more than  $\$230$  billion, the largest-ever one-day dollar decline.

As perceptions of future prospects wax and wane, share price can swing wildly, as Facebook illustrates. Growth prospects are intrinsically difficult to tie down; ultimately, however, those prospects drive the value of the most dynamic firms in the economy.

The nearby box contains a simple valuation analysis. Facebook's 2012 IPO was among the most highly anticipated in the decade, and there was widespread speculation (and disagreement) about the price at which it would eventually trade. The points of contention turned on two key questions: First, what was a reasonable projection for the growth rate of Facebook's profits? Second, what multiple of earnings was appropriate to translate an earnings forecast into a price forecast? These are precisely the questions addressed by our stock valuation models.

# Concept Check 18.5

ABC stock has an expected ROE of  $12\%$  per year, expected earnings per share of  $\$ 2$ , and expected dividends of  $\$ 1.50$  per share. Its market capitalization rate is  $10\%$  per year.

a. What are its expected growth rate, its price, and its P/E ratio?
b. If the plowback ratio were .4, what would be the expected dividend per share, the growth rate, price, and the P/E ratio?

# P/E Ratios and Stock Risk

One important implication of any stock-valuation model is that (holding all else equal) riskier stocks will have lower P/E multiples. We can see this in the context of the constant-growth model by examining the formula for the P/E ratio (Equation 18.8):

$$
\frac {P}{E} = \frac {1 - b}{k - g}
$$

Riskier firms have higher required rates of return, that is, higher values of  $k$ . Therefore, their P/E multiples will be lower. This is true more generally. For any expected earnings and dividend stream, the present value of those cash flows will be lower when the stream is perceived to be riskier. Hence, the stock price and the ratio of price to earnings will be lower.

Of course, you can find many small, risky, start-up companies with very high P/E multiples. This does not contradict our claim that P/E multiples should fall with risk; instead it is evidence of the market's expectations of high growth rates for those companies. This is why we said that high-risk firms will have lower P/E ratios holding all else equal. Given a growth projection, the P/E multiple will be lower when risk is perceived to be higher.

As Facebook's IPO drew near, valuation estimates by professional analysts were surprisingly disparate, ranging from as little as \$50 billion to as much as \$125 billion.

Disputes over fair value turned on a few key questions: Just how fast would the company be able to grow? How much profit would it be able to derive from advertising? And what earnings multiple would the market be willing to pay for that profit stream?

Everyone believed that Facebook had many years of rapid growth before it, but even so, its recent growth rate was lower than in its early years. While revenue grew  $88\%$  in 2011, and net income grew  $65\%$ , that increase was nevertheless considerably below the  $154\%$  increase in revenue from 2009 to 2010.

The president of IPOdesktop.com, which analyzes IPOs for investors, estimated Facebook's value at no more than \$50 billion.* Even that value, at the low end of the range of most analysts, seemed generous in some respects: It would have been 50 times Facebook's 2011 profits of \$1 billion, and a P/E multiple of 50 was more than triple the market's average price-to-earnings ratio at the time.


However, much higher estimates also were offered. For example, an analyst at Wedge Partners believed the value could top \$100 billion. If Facebook traded at 15 to 18 times next year's EBITDA (expected earnings before interest, taxes, and certain noncash charges), it would result in a stock valuation of around \$89 billion. But if Facebook could generate faster growth in ad spending, that could justify a multiple as high as 20 times EBITDA, implying a \$110 billion valuation. By comparison, more mature companies such as Microsoft or Google traded at 7-10 times EBITDA. IPOdesktop was unconvinced, pointing out that at a \$100 billion valuation, Facebook would be worth about half as much as Google, even though Google's sales and profits were 10 times that of Facebook.

In the end, based on its IPO price, the market valued Facebook at about 90 billion.

*The valuation estimates cited in this box appeared in Randall Smith, "Facebook's 100 Billion Question," *The Wall Street Journal*, February 3, 2012.

# Pitfalls in P/E Analysis

No description of P/E analysis is complete without mentioning some of its pitfalls. First, consider that the denominator in the P/E ratio is accounting earnings, which are influenced by somewhat arbitrary rules such as the use of historical cost in depreciation and inventory valuation. In times of high inflation, historic cost depreciation and inventory costs will tend to underrepresent true economic values because the replacement cost of both goods and capital equipment will rise with the general level of prices. As Figure 18.3 demonstrates, P/E ratios generally have been inversely related to the inflation rate. In part, this reflects the market's assessment that earnings in high inflation periods are of "lower quality," artificially distorted by inflation, and warranting lower P/E ratios.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/75a1de08f5e862d526c54c9ae69e3197701ad8fa996dd558628c3d182e08968f.jpg)
Figure 18.3 P/E ratio of the S&P 500 versus inflation rate, 1955-2020.

Earnings management is the practice of using flexibility in accounting rules to improve the apparent profitability of the firm. We will have much to say on this topic in the next chapter on interpreting financial statements. One version of earnings management is the reporting of "pro forma earnings."

Pro forma earnings are calculated ignoring certain expenses, for example, restructuring charges or write-downs of assets from continuing operations. Firms argue that ignoring these often one-time expenses gives a clearer picture of underlying profitability. Comparisons with earlier periods arguably can make more sense if those costs are excluded.

But when there is too much leeway for choosing what to exclude, it becomes hard to interpret the numbers or to compare them across firms. The lack of standards gives firms considerable leeway to manage earnings.

Even generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) allow firms considerable discretion to manage earnings. For example, in the late 1990s, Kellogg took restructuring charges, which are supposed to be one-time events, nine quarters in a row. Were these really one-time events, or were they more appropriately treated as ordinary expenses? Given the available leeway in managing earnings, the justified P/E multiple becomes difficult to gauge.

Another confounding factor in the use of P/E ratios is related to the business cycle. We were careful in deriving the DDM to define earnings as being net of economic depreciation, that is, the maximum flow of income that the firm could pay out without depleting its productive capacity. But reported earnings are computed in accordance with GAAP and need not correspond to economic earnings. Beyond this complication, notions of a normal or justified P/E ratio, as in Equation 18.7 or 18.8, assume implicitly that earnings rise at a constant rate, or, put another way, on a smooth trend line. In contrast, reported earnings can fluctuate dramatically around a trend line over the course of the business cycle.

Another way to make this point is to note that the "normal" P/E ratio predicted by Equation 18.8 is the ratio of today's price to the trend value of future earnings,  $E_{1}$ . This is called the forward P/E. The P/E ratio reported in the financial press, by contrast, is the ratio of price to the most recent past accounting earnings and is called the trailing P/E. Current earnings can differ considerably from their trend values. Because ownership of stock conveys the right to future as well as current earnings, the trailing P/E ratio can vary substantially over the business cycle.

Because the market values the entire stream of future dividends, when earnings are temporarily depressed, the P/E ratio should tend to be high—that is, the denominator of the ratio responds more sensitively to the business cycle than the numerator. Conversely, when earnings are temporarily high, the P/E ratio will be depressed, as price increases less dramatically than earnings.

Figure 18.4 graphs the earnings per share of PepsiCo and Consolidated Edison since 2001, and Figure 18.5 plots their P/E ratios. When earnings depart from the trend line, the P/E ratio does in fact move in the opposite direction. For example, when Con Ed's earnings fell in 2001-2003, its P/E ratio rose. Similarly, when Pepsi's earnings per share increased at an above-trend rate of  $17\%$  between 2008 and 2009, its P/E fell.

This example shows why analysts must be careful in using P/E ratios. There is no way to say the P/E ratio is overly high or low without referring to the company's long-run growth prospects, as well as to current earnings per share relative to the long-run trend line.

Nevertheless, Figures 18.4 and 18.5 demonstrate a clear relation between P/E ratios and growth. Despite considerable short-run fluctuations, PepsiCo's EPS clearly trended upward over the period. Con Ed's earnings were nearly flat. PepsiCo's growth prospects are reflected in its consistently higher P/E multiple.

This analysis suggests that P/E ratios should vary across industries, and in fact they do. Figure 18.6 shows P/E ratios for a sample of industries. Notice that some of the industries with the highest multiples—such as online retail or biotech—have attractive investment opportunities and relatively high growth rates, whereas the industries with the lowest ratios—for example, steel, chemicals, or tobacco—are in more mature or less profitable industries with limited growth opportunities. The relationship between P/E and growth is not perfect, which is not surprising in light of the pitfalls discussed in this section, but as a general rule, the P/E multiple does appear to track growth opportunities.

# The Cyclically Adjusted P/E Ratio

To avoid the problems associated with using P/E ratios over different phases of the business cycle, Robert Shiller suggests a "cyclically adjusted" P/E ratio (CAPE). His idea is to divide the stock price by an estimate of sustainable long-term earnings rather than current earnings. He proposes using average inflation-adjusted earnings over an extended period, for example, 10 years.

Figure 18.7 shows both the CAPE and the conventional P/E ratio for the S&P 500. Notice that the plot of CAPE is smoother than that of the conventional P/E, as it abstracts from short-term and presumably temporary economic conditions. Look at the 1980s, for example, where the actual P/E ratio "vibrates" around the CAPE. The difference between them is most acute at the height of the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Earnings fell sharply, bottoming out in March 2009; stock prices also fell, but far less precipitously, as investors forecast that the earnings decline would not be permanent. As a result, the P/E ratio of the S&P 500


![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/3cc9177dcba7bb0d9e8e8e345d06d17a4014c2f0bd9e2812f65127363e4cd461.jpg) skyrocketed. In contrast, the CAPE, which compares prices to a full decade of earnings, initially fell along with stock prices in 2008 and then rose far less dramatically, increasing from 13.3 in March 2009 to 20.3 by the end of the year.

Because it uses a more reliable estimate of sustainable earnings, Shiller argues that CAPE is a better gauge of potential market mispricing. Consistent with this view, there seems to be a strong inverse correlation between the CAPE and market returns over the following decade, suggesting that a high CAPE may signify an overpriced market.

# Combining P/E Analysis and the DDM

Some analysts use P/E ratios in conjunction with earnings forecasts to estimate the price of a stock at an investor's horizon date. The Toyota analysis in Figure 18.2 shows that Value Line forecast a P/E ratio for 2025 of 12. EPS for 2025 was forecast at 16.35, implying a price in 2025 of 12 \times 16.35 = 196.20. Given this estimate for the 2025 sales price, we would compute intrinsic value in 2021 as

$$
V _ {2 0 2 1} = \frac {4 . 4 5}{1 . 0 8 4} + \frac {4 . 8 1}{(1 . 0 8 4) ^ {2}} + \frac {5 . 1 8}{(1 . 0 8 4) ^ {3}} + \frac {5 . 5 5 + 1 9 6 . 2 0}{(1 . 0 8 4) ^ {4}} = \$ 1 5 8. 3 8
$$

# Other Comparative Valuation Ratios

The price-earnings ratio is an example of a comparative valuation ratio. Such ratios are used to assess the valuation of one firm versus another based on a fundamental indicator such as earnings. For example, an analyst might compare the P/E ratios of two firms in the same industry to test whether the market is valuing one firm "more aggressively" than the other. Other comparative ratios that are commonly used include the price-to-book ratio, the price-to-cash-flow ratio, and the price-to-sales ratio.

Price-to-Book Ratio This is the ratio of price per share divided by book value per share. As we noted earlier, some analysts view book value as a useful measure of value and therefore treat the ratio of price to book value as an indicator of how aggressively the market values the firm.

Price-to-Cash-Flow Ratio Earnings as reported on the income statement can be affected by the company's choice of accounting practices and thus are commonly viewed as subject to some imprecision and even manipulation. In contrast, cash flow—which tracks cash actually flowing into or out of the firm—is less affected by accounting decisions. As a result, some analysts prefer to use the ratio of price to cash flow per share rather than price to earnings per share. Some analysts use operating cash flow when calculating this ratio; others prefer "free cash flow," that is, operating cash flow net of new investment.

Price-to-Sales Ratio Many start-up firms have no earnings. As a result, the price-earnings ratio for these firms is meaningless. The price-to-sales ratio (the ratio of stock price to the annual sales per share) may be used as an alternative valuation benchmark for these firms. Of course, price-to-sales ratios can vary markedly across industries because profit margins vary widely.

Be Creative Sometimes a standard valuation ratio simply will not be available, and you will have to devise your own. In the 1990s, some analysts valued retail Internet firms based on the number of hits their Web sites received. As it turns out, they valued these firms using too-generous "price-to-hits" ratios. Nevertheless, in a new investment environment, these analysts used the information available to them to devise the best valuation tools they could.

Figure 18.8 presents the behavior of several valuation measures. While the levels of these ratios differ considerably, for the most part, they are clearly correlated, with upturns and downturns generally occurring at the same times.

# 18.5 Free Cash Flow Valuation Approaches

An alternative approach to the dividend discount model values the firm using free cash flow, that is, cash flow available to the firm or its equityholders net of capital expenditures. This approach is particularly useful for firms that pay no dividends, for which the dividend discount model would be difficult to implement. But free cash flow models may be applied to any firm and can provide useful insights about firm value beyond the DDM.

One approach is to discount the free cash flow for the firm (FCFF) at the weighted-average cost of capital to find the value of the entire firm. Subtracting the value of debt results in the value of equity. Another approach is to focus from the start on the free cash flow to equityholders (FCFE), discounting those directly at the cost of equity to obtain the market value of equity.

The free cash flow to the firm is the after-tax cash flow generated by the firm's operations, net of investments in fixed as well as working capital. It includes cash flows available to both debt- and equityholders and equals:

$\mathrm{FCFF} = \mathrm{EBIT}(1 - t_c) + \mathrm{Depreciation} - \mathrm{Capital expenditures} - \mathrm{Increase in NWC}$  (18.9) where


EBIT = earnings before interest and taxes

$t_c =$  the corporate tax rate

$\mathrm{NWC} =$  net working capital

Alternatively, we can focus on cash flow available to equityholders. This will differ from free cash flow to the firm by after-tax interest expenditures, as well as by cash flow associated with net issuance or repurchase of debt (i.e., principal repayments minus proceeds from issuance of new debt).

$\mathrm{FCFE} = \mathrm{FCFF} - \mathrm{Interest~expense}\times (1 - t_c) + \mathrm{Increases~in~net~debt}$  (18.10)

A free cash flow to the firm valuation model discounts year-by-year cash flows plus an estimate of terminal value,  $V_{T}$ . In Equation 18.11, we use the constant-growth model to estimate terminal value and discount at the weighted-average cost of capital.

Firm value  $= \sum_{t = 1}^{T}\frac{\mathrm{FCFF}_t}{(1 + \mathrm{WACC})^t} +\frac{V_T}{(1 + \mathrm{WACC})^T},$  where  $V_{T} = \frac{\mathrm{FCFF}_{T + 1}}{\mathrm{WACC} - g}$  (18.11)

To find equity value, we subtract the market value of outstanding debt from the derived value of the firm.

Alternatively, we can discount free cash flows to equity (FCFE) at the cost of equity,  $k_{E}$ .

Intrinsic value of equity  $= \sum_{t = 1}^{T}\frac{\mathrm{FCFE}_t}{(1 + k_E)^t} +\frac{E_T}{(1 + k_E)^T},$  where  $E_{T} = \frac{\mathrm{FCFE}_{T + 1}}{k_{E} - g}$  (18.12)

As in the dividend discount model, free cash flow models use a terminal value to avoid adding the present values of an infinite sum of cash flows. That terminal value may be the present value of a constant-growth perpetuity (as in the formulas above) or it may be based

# Spreadsheet 18.2

Free cash flow valuation of Toyota on a multiple of EBIT, book value, earnings, or free cash flow. As a general rule, estimates of intrinsic value depend critically on terminal value.


Spreadsheet 18.2 presents a free cash flow valuation of Toyota using the data supplied by Value Line in Figure 18.2. We start with the free cash flow to the firm approach given in Equation 18.9. Panel A of the spreadsheet lays out values supplied by Value Line for 2021, 2022, and 2025. Entries for middle years are interpolated from beginning and final values. Panel B calculates free cash flow. The sum of after-tax profits in row 11 (from Value Line) plus after-tax interest payments in row 12 [i.e., interest expense  $\times (1 - t_c)]$  equals EBIT  $(1 - t_{c})$ . In row 13 we subtract the change in net working capital, in row 14 we add back depreciation, and in row 15 we subtract capital expenditures. The result in row 17 is the free cash flow to the firm, FCFF, for each year between 2022 and 2025.

To find the present value of these cash flows, we discount at WACC, which is calculated in Panel C. WACC is the weighted average of the after-tax cost of debt and the cost of equity in each year. When computing WACC, we must account for the change in leverage forecast by Value Line. To compute the cost of equity, we will use the CAPM as in our earlier (dividend discount model) valuation exercise, but accounting for the fact that equity beta will decline each year as the firm reduces leverage.[11]


To find Toyota's cost of debt, we note that its long-term bonds were rated A1 by Moody's in 2021 and that yields to maturity on this quality debt at the time were about  $2.5\%$ . Toyota's debt-to-value ratio (assuming its debt is selling near par value) is computed in row 29. In 2021, the ratio was .2924. Based on Value Line forecasts, it will fall to .2876 by 2025. We interpolate the debt-to-value ratio for the intermediate years. WACC is computed in row 32. WACC increases very slightly over time as leverage declines between 2021 and 2025. The present value factor for cash flows accruing in each year is the previous year's factor divided by  $(1 + \mathrm{WACC})$  for that year. The present value of each cash flow (row 37) is the free cash flow times the cumulative discount factor.

The terminal value of the firm (cell H17) is computed from the constant-growth model as  $\mathrm{FCFF}_{2025} \times (1 + g) / (\mathrm{WACC}_{2025} - g)$ , where  $g$  (cell B23) is the assumed value for the steady growth rate. We assume in the spreadsheet that  $g = .05$ , in line with the long-run growth rate used in Spreadsheet 18.1. Terminal value is also discounted back to 2021 (cell H37), and the intrinsic value of the firm is thus found as the sum of discounted free cash flows between 2022 and 2025. plus the discounted terminal value. Finally, the value of debt in 2021 is subtracted from firm value to arrive at the intrinsic value of equity (cell K37), and value per share is calculated in cell L37 as equity value divided by number of shares.

The free cash flow to equity approach yields a similar intrinsic value for the stock. Free cash flow to equity (row 18) is obtained from FCFF by subtracting after-tax interest expense and adding net new debt issues.[12] FCFE is discounted at the equity rate. Like WACC, the cost of equity changes each period as leverage changes. Although Value Line forecasts that Toyota will be issuing debt, it also projects a steady increase in the P/E ratio and therefore the market value of equity. Therefore, its forecast of the debt-to-value ratio declines a bit over this period. The present value factor for equity cash flows is presented in row 34. Equity value is reported in cell J38, which is put on a per-share basis in cell L38.

Spreadsheet 18.2 is available in Connect or through your course instructor.

# Comparing the Valuation Models

In principle, the free cash flow approach is fully consistent with the dividend discount model and should provide the same estimate of intrinsic value. This was demonstrated in two famous papers by Modigliani and Miller.[13] However, in practice, you will find that values from these models may differ, sometimes substantially. This is due to the fact that in practice, analysts are always forced to make simplifying assumptions. For example, how long will it

Call  $\beta_{\mathrm{L}}$  the firm's equity beta at the initial level of leverage as provided by Value Line. Equity betas reflect both business risk and financial risk. When a firm changes its capital structure (debt/equity mix), it changes financial risk, and therefore equity beta changes. How should we recognize the change in financial risk? As you may remember from an introductory corporate finance class, you must first unleverage beta. This leaves us with business risk. We use the following formula to find unleveraged beta,  $\beta_{\mathrm{U}}$  (where  $D / E$  is the firm's current debt-equity ratio):

$$
\beta_ {\mathrm {U}} = \frac {\beta_ {\mathrm {L}}}{1 + (D / E) \left(1 - t _ {c}\right)}
$$

Then, we re-leverage beta in any particular year using the forecast capital structure for that year (which reintroduces the financial risk associated with that year's capital structure):

$$
\beta_ {\mathrm {L}} = \beta_ {\mathrm {U}} [ 1 + (D / E) (1 - t _ {c}) ]
$$

We assume that after 2025, as Toyota reinvests earnings and thereby increases equity, it will issue just enough debt to maintain its debt-to-value ratio at a fixed level. This assumption is consistent with the assumption of a stable growth rate and fixed value of WACC after 2025. If leverage were not fixed, then WACC also would be changing. Similarly, the use of the sustainable growth rate,  $g = b \times \mathrm{ROE}$ , in the DDM also implicitly assumes a fixed leverage ratio.
Franco Modigliani and M. Miller, "The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance, and the Theory of Investment," American Economic Review, June 1958; and Franco Modigliani and M. Miller, "Dividend Policy, Growth, and the Valuation of Shares," Journal of Business, October 1961.

take the firm to enter a constant-growth stage? How should depreciation best be treated? What is the best estimate of ROE? Answers to questions like these can have a big impact on value, and it is not always easy to maintain consistent assumptions across the models.

We have now valued Toyota using several approaches, with estimates of intrinsic value as follows:

<table><tr><td>Model</td><td>Intrinsic Value</td></tr><tr><td>Two-stage dividend discount model</td><td>140.41</td></tr><tr><td>DDM with earnings multiple terminal value</td><td>158.38</td></tr><tr><td>Three-stage DDM</td><td>157.00</td></tr><tr><td>Free cash flow to the firm</td><td>137.87</td></tr><tr><td>Free cash flow to equity</td><td>128.56</td></tr><tr><td>Market price (from Value Line)</td><td>152.23</td></tr></table>

The free cash flow to equity model produces the most conservative estimate in this case, suggesting that intrinsic value is about  $15\%$  below the stock price. The two-stage DDM using an earnings multiple for terminal value produces the most aggressive estimate of intrinsic value, about  $4\%$  above market price. The other estimates are scattered more tightly but still with estimates on either side of market price. So there is considerable disagreement in these signals about whether Toyota's market valuation is too optimistic or pessimistic relative to its intrinsic value.

What should we make of these differences? There is an important lesson here. Models are all unavoidably simplified versions of the real world. The hard part in using them well is not in performing the calculations. The challenge is ensuring that your inputs make sense. We've already mentioned the importance of sensitivity analysis. You also need to think more broadly about reality tests. Is the sustainable growth rate plausible? Is the date at which the firm is assumed to settle down to a trend growth trajectory reasonable? Are the final values for ROE and plowback consistent and credible? These questions require good judgment rather than just technical skills.

On balance, therefore, this valuation exercise suggests that finding bargains is not generally going to be easy. Although applying these models is straightforward, establishing proper inputs is not. This should not be surprising. In even a moderately efficient market, finding profit opportunities will be more involved than analyzing financial data for a few hours. These models are extremely useful to analysts, however, because they provide ballpark estimates of intrinsic value. More than that, they force rigorous thought about underlying assumptions and highlight the variables with the greatest impact on value and the greatest payoff to further analysis.

# The Problem with DCF Models

Our estimates of Toyota's intrinsic value are all based on discounted cash flow (DCF) models, in which we calculate the present value of forecasted cash flows and a terminal sales price at some future date. It is clear from our calculations that most of the action in these models is in the terminal value and that this value can be highly sensitive to even small changes in some input values (see, e.g., Concept Check 18.4). Therefore, you must recognize that DCF valuation estimates are almost always going to be imprecise. Growth opportunities and future growth rates are especially hard to pin down.

For this reason, many value-oriented investors employ a hierarchy of valuation. They view the most reliable components of value as the items on the balance sheet that, in principle, can be sold and for which estimates of market value are readily available. Real estate, plant, and equipment would fall in this category.

A somewhat less reliable component of value is the economic profit on assets already in place. For example, a company like Apple earns a far higher ROE on its investments in new iPhones than its cost of capital. The present value of these "economic profits," or economic value added, $^{14}$  is a major component of Apple's market value. This component of value is less certain than its balance sheet assets, however, because there is always a concern that new competitors will enter the market, force down prices and profit margins, and reduce the return on Apple's investments. Thus, one needs to carefully assess the barriers to entry that protect Apple's pricing and profit margins. We noted some of these barriers in the last chapter, where we discussed the role of industry analysis, market structure, and competitive position (see Section 17.6).


Finally, the least reliable components of value are growth opportunities, the purported ability of firms like Apple to invest in positive-NPV ventures that contribute to high market valuations today. Value investors don't deny that such opportunities exist, but they are skeptical that precise values can be attached to them and, therefore, tend to be less willing to make investment decisions that depend on the value of those opportunities. We saw earlier that a good chunk of the market's assessment of Facebook's growth opportunities disappeared in one day when it reported disappointing earnings growth.

# 18.6 The Aggregate Stock Market

The most popular approach to valuing the overall stock market is the earnings multiplier approach applied at the aggregate level. The first step is to forecast corporate profits for the coming period. Then we derive an estimate of the earnings multiplier, the aggregate P/E ratio, based on a forecast of long-term interest rates. The product of the two forecasts is the estimate of the end-of-period level of the market.

The forecast of the P/E ratio of the market is sometimes derived from a graph similar to that in Figure 18.9, which plots the earnings yield (earnings per share divided by price per share, the reciprocal of the P/E ratio) of the S&P 500 and the yield to maturity on 10-year Treasury bonds. The two series clearly move together over time and suggest that this relationship and the current yield on 10-year Treasury bonds could help in forecasting the earnings yield on the S&P 500. Given the earnings yield, a forecast of earnings could be used to predict the level of the S&P in some future period. Let's illustrate with a simple example.

# Example 18.8 Forecasting the Aggregate Stock Market

In 2021, the forecast for 12-month earnings per share for the S&P 500 portfolio was about 196.36. The 10-year Treasury bond yield was about 1.75\%. As a first approach, we might posit that the spread between the earnings yield and the Treasury yield, which had averaged about 2\% in the previous three years, will remain at that level by the end of the year. Given a Treasury yield of 1.75\%, this would imply an earnings yield for the S&P of 3.75\%, and a P/E ratio of 1/.0375 = 26.67. Our forecast for the level of the S&P index would then be 196.36 \times 26.67 = 5,236. Given a current value for the S&P 500 of 4,420, this would imply a 1-year capital gain on the index of 816/4,420 = 18.5\%.

Of course, there is uncertainty regarding all three inputs into this analysis: the actual earnings on the S&P 500 stocks, the level of Treasury yields at year-end, and the spread between the Treasury yield and the earnings yield. One would wish to perform sensitivity or scenario analysis to examine the impact of changes in all of these variables. To illustrate, consider Table 18.4, which shows the possible effects of variation in the Treasury bond yield. The scenario analysis shows that the forecast level of the stock market varies inversely and with dramatic sensitivity to interest rate changes.

Forecast for the earnings yield on the S&P 500 equals Treasury bond yield plus  $2.0\%$ . The P/E ratio is the reciprocal of the forecast earnings yield.

Some analysts use an aggregate version of the dividend discount model rather than an earnings multiplier approach. All of these models, however, rely heavily on forecasts of such macroeconomic variables as GDP, interest rates, and the rate of inflation, which are difficult to predict accurately.

Because stock prices reflect expectations of future dividends, which are tied to the economic fortunes of firms, it is not surprising that the performance of a broad-based stock index like the S&P 500 is used as a leading economic indicator, that is, a predictor of the performance of the aggregate economy. Stock prices are viewed as embodying consensus forecasts of economic activity and are assumed to move up or down in anticipation of movements in the economy. The government's index of leading economic indicators, which is taken to predict the progress of the business cycle, is made up in part of recent stock market performance. However, the predictive value of the market is far from perfect. A well-known joke, often attributed to Paul Samuelson, is that the market has forecast eight of the last five recessions.

1. One approach to firm valuation is to focus on the firm's book value, either as it appears on the balance sheet or as adjusted to reflect current replacement cost of assets or liquidation value. Another approach is to focus on the present value of expected future dividends.
2. The dividend discount model states that the price of a share of stock should equal the present value of all future dividends per share, discounted at an interest rate commensurate with its risk.
3. Dividend discount models give estimates of the intrinsic value of a stock. If price does not equal intrinsic value, the rate of return will differ from the equilibrium return based on the stock's risk. The forecasted return will depend on the rate at which the stock price is predicted to revert to its intrinsic value.
4. The constant-growth version of the DDM asserts that if dividends are expected to grow at a constant rate forever, the intrinsic value of the stock is determined by the formula

$$
V _ {0} = \frac {D _ {1}}{k - g}
$$

This version of the DDM assumes a constant value for  $g$ . There are more sophisticated multistage versions of the model for more-complex environments. When the constant-growth assumption is reasonably satisfied and the stock is selling for its intrinsic value, the formula can be inverted to infer the market capitalization rate for the stock:

$$ k = \frac {D _ {1}}{P _ {0}} + g
$$

5. The constant-growth dividend discount model is best suited for firms that are expected to exhibit stable growth rates over the foreseeable future. In reality, however, firms progress through life cycles. In early years, attractive investment opportunities are ample and the firm responds with high plowback ratios and rapid dividend growth. Eventually, however, growth rates level off to more sustainable values. Three-stage growth models are well suited to such a pattern. These models allow for an initial period of rapid growth, a final period of steady dividend growth, and a middle, or transition, period in which the dividend growth rate declines from its initial high rate to the lower sustainable rate.
6. Stock market analysts devote considerable attention to a company's price-to-earnings ratio. The P/E ratio reflects the market's assessment of the firm's growth opportunities. Firms with no growth opportunities should have a P/E ratio that is the reciprocal of the capitalization rate,  $k$ . As growth opportunities become a progressively more important component of the total value of the firm, the P/E ratio will increase.
7. The expected growth rate of earnings is related both to the firm's expected profitability and to its dividend policy. The relationship can be expressed as

$$ g = (\text {R O E} \times (1 - \text {D i v i d e n d p a y o u t r a t i o})
$$

8. You can relate any DDM to a simple capitalized earnings model by comparing the expected ROE on future investments to the market capitalization rate,  $k$ . If the two rates are equal, then the stock's intrinsic value equals expected earnings per share (EPS) divided by  $k$ .
9. Many analysts form their estimates of a stock's value by multiplying their forecast of next year's EPS by a predicted P/E multiple. Some analysts mix the P/E approach with the dividend discount model. They use an earnings multiplier to forecast the terminal value of shares at a future date, and add the present value of that terminal value to the present value of all interim dividend payments.
10. The free cash flow approach is the one used most often in corporate finance. The analyst first estimates the value of the firm as the present value of expected future free cash flows to the entire firm and then subtracts the value of all claims other than equity. Alternatively, free cash flows to equity can be discounted at a rate appropriate to the risk of the stock.
11. The models presented in this chapter can be used to explain and forecast the behavior of the aggregate stock market. The key macroeconomic variables that determine the level of stock prices in the aggregate are interest rates and corporate profits.

22. The MoMi Corporation's cash flow from operations before interest and taxes was \$2 million in the year just ended, and it expects that this will grow by 5\% per year forever. To make this happen, the firm will have to invest an amount equal to 20\% of pretax cash flow each year. The tax rate is 21\%. Depreciation was \$200,000 in the year just ended and is expected to grow at the same rate as the operating cash flow.

Use the free cash flow approach to value the firm's equity.

23. Chiptech, Inc., is an established computer chip firm with several profitable existing products as well as some promising new products in development. The company earned \$1 a share last year and just paid out a dividend of $.50 per share. Investors believe the company plans to maintain its dividend payout ratio at 50\%. ROE equals 20\%. Everyone in the market expects this situation to persist indefinitely.

a. What is the market price of Chiptech stock? The required return for the computer chip industry is  $15\%$ , and the company has just gone ex-dividend (i.e., the next dividend will be paid a year from now, at  $t = 1$ ).
b. Suppose you discover that Chiptech's competitor has developed a new chip that will eliminate Chiptech's current technological advantage in this market. This new product, which will be ready to come to the market in two years, will force Chiptech to reduce the prices of its chips starting in year 3 to remain competitive. This will decrease ROE in the third year and beyond to  $15\%$ . Anticipating the reduced profitability of new investments that will take hold beginning in year 3, the firm plows back a lower fraction of earnings starting at the end of the second year; therefore, the plowback ratio in year 2 and beyond will fall to .40. What is your estimate of Chiptech's intrinsic value per share? (Hint: Carefully prepare a table of Chiptech's earnings and dividends for each of the next three years. Pay close attention to the change in the payout ratio at the end of the second year.)


c. No one else in the market perceives the threat to Chiptech's market. In fact, you are confident that no one else will become aware of the change in Chiptech's competitive status until the competitor firm publicly announces its discovery near the end of year 2. What will be the rate of return on Chiptech stock in the coming year (i.e., between  $t = 0$  and  $t = 1$ )? (Hint for parts c through e: Pay attention to when the market catches on to the new situation. A table of dividends and market prices over time might help.)
$d$ . What will be the rate of return on Chiptech stock in the second year (between  $t = 1$  and  $t = 2$ )?
$e$ . What will be the rate of return on Chiptech stock in the third year (between  $t = 2$  and  $t = 3$ )?

6. Mike Brandreth, an analyst who specializes in the electronics industry, is preparing a research report on Dynamic Communication. A colleague suggests to Brandreth that he may be able to determine Dynamic's implied dividend growth rate from Dynamic's current common stock price, using the Gordon growth model. Brandreth believes that the appropriate required rate of return for Dynamic's equity is  $8\%$ .

a. Assume that the firm's current stock price of 58.49 equals intrinsic value. What sustained rate of dividend growth as of December 2023 is implied by this value? Use the constant-growth dividend discount model (i.e., the Gordon growth model).
b. The management of Dynamic has indicated to Brandreth and other analysts that the company's current dividend policy will be continued. Is the use of the Gordon growth model to value Dynamic's common stock appropriate or inappropriate? Justify your response based on the assumptions of the Gordon growth model.

Note 3: The decrease in long-term debt represents an unscheduled principal repayment; there was no new borrowing during the year.
Note 4: On January 1, 2022, the company received cash from issuing 400,000 shares of common equity at a price of 25.00 per share.
Note 5: A new appraisal during the year increased the estimated market value of land held for investment by 2 million, which was not recognized in 2022 income.

10. While valuing the equity of Rio National Corp. (see CFA Problem 9), Katrina Shaar is considering the use of either cash flow from operations (CFO) or free cash flow to equity (FCFE) in her valuation process.

a. State two adjustments that Shaar should make to cash flow from operations to obtain free cash flow to equity.
b. Shaar decides to calculate Rio National's FCFE for the year 2022, starting with net income. Determine for each of the five supplemental notes given in Table 18H whether an adjustment should be made to net income to calculate Rio National's free cash flow to equity for the year 2022, and the dollar amount of any adjustment.
c. Calculate Rio National's free cash flow to equity for the year 2022.

11. Shaar (see CFA Problem 10) has revised slightly her estimated earnings growth rate for Rio National and, using normalized (underlying trend) EPS, which is adjusted for temporary impacts on earnings, now wants to compare the current value of Rio National's equity to that of the industry, on a growth-adjusted basis. Selected information about Rio National and the industry is given in Table 18K.

Compared to the industry, is Rio National's equity overvalued or undervalued on a P/E-to-growth (PEG) basis, using normalized (underlying trend) earnings per share? Assume that the risk of Rio National is similar to the risk of the industry.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. a. Dividend yield  $= \ 2.15 / \$  50 = 4.3\%

$$
\text{Capital gains yield} = (59.77 - 50) / 50 = 19.54 \%
$$

$$
\text{Total return} = 4.3 \% + 19.54 \% = 23.84 \%
$$ b.  $k = 6\% + 1.15(14\% - 6\%) = 15.2\%$ .

 c. V0 = ($2.15 + $59.77)/1.152 = 53.75, which exceeds the market price. This would indicate a "buy" opportunity.

2. a. D₁/(k - g) = $2.15/(.152 -.112) = $53.75.

b. P_{1} = P_{0}(1 + g) = \53.75(1.112) = \$59.77. c. The expected capital gain equals  $\59.77 - \$ 53.75 = \$6.02 , for a percentage gain of  $11.2\%$ . The dividend yield is  $D_{1} / P_{0} = 2.15 / 53.75 = 4\%$ , for a holding-period return of  $4\% + 11.2\% = 15.2\%$ .

3.  $a$ .  $g = \mathrm{ROE} \times b = 20\% \times .60 = 12\%$ .

$$
D _ {1} = . 4 \times E _ {1} = . 4 \times \$ 5 = \$ 2.
$$

$$
P _ {0} = \$ 2 / (. 1 2 5 -. 1 2) = \$ 4 0 0.
$$ b. When the firm invests in projects with ROE less than  $k$ , its stock price falls. If  $b = .60$ , then  $g = 10\% \times .60 = 6\%$  and  $P_0 = \2 / (.125 - .06) = \$ 30.77 . In contrast, if  $b = 0$ , then  $P_0 = \5 / 125 = \$ 40 .


4.  $V_{2021} = \frac{4.45}{(1.084)} +\frac{4.81}{(1.084)^2} +\frac{5.18}{(1.084)^3} +\frac{5.55 + P_{2025}}{(1.084)^4}$

To estimate  $P_{2025}$  in this equation, use the constant-growth dividend discount model, but assuming the sustainable growth rate will be  $g = 5\%$ .

$$
P _ {2 0 2 5} = \frac {5 . 5 5 \times (1 + g)}{k - g} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 5 . 5 5 \times 1 . 0 5}{. 0 8 4 -. 0 5} = \mathbb {S} 1 7 1. 4 0
$$

Therefore,  $V_{2021} = \$ 140.42$ .

5. a. ROE = 12\%.

$$ b = \mathbb {.} 5 0 / \mathbb {S} 2. 0 0 = \mathbb {.} 2 5.
$$

$$ g = \mathrm {ROE} \times b = 12 \% \times .25 = 3 \%
$$

$$
P _ {0} = D _ {1} / (k - g) = \ 1. 5 0 / (. 1 0 -. 0 3) = \ 2 1. 4 3 .
$$

$$
P _ {0} / E _ {1} = \ 2 1. 4 3 / \ 2. 0 0 = 1 0. 7 1.
$$ b. If  $b = .4$ , then  $.4 \times \2 = \$ 80  would be reinvested and the remainder of earnings, or  $1.20\$ , would be paid as dividends.


$$ g = 12 \% \times .4 = 4.8 \%
$$

$$
P _ {0} = D _ {1} / (k - g) = \ 1. 2 0 / (. 1 0 -. 0 4 8) = \ 2 3. 0 8 .
$$

$$
P _ {0} / E _ {1} = \ 23.08 / \ 2.00 = 11.54.

# Financial Statement Analysis

# 19

IN THE PREVIOUS chapter, we explored equity valuation techniques. These techniques take the firm's dividends and earnings prospects as inputs. Although the analyst is interested in economic earnings streams, only financial accounting data are readily available. What can we learn from a company's financial statements that can help us estimate the intrinsic value of its common stock? In this chapter, we show how investors use financial data as inputs in their valuation analysis.

We start by reviewing the basic sources of such data—the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows. We note the difference between economic and accounting earnings. Although economic earnings are more important for issues of valuation, they can at best be estimated, so, in practice, analysts always begin with accounting data. We show how analysts use financial ratios to explore the sources of a firm's profitability and evaluate the "quality" of its earnings in a systematic fashion. We also examine the impact of debt policy on various financial ratios.


Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the challenges you will encounter when using financial statement analysis as a tool in uncovering mispriced securities. Some of these issues arise from differences in firms' accounting procedures. Others are due to inflation-induced distortions in accounting numbers.

# 19.1 The Major Financial Statements

# The Income Statement

The income statement summarizes the profitability of the firm over a period of time, such as a year. It presents revenues generated during that period, the expenses incurred, and the company's net income, which is simply the difference between revenues and expenses.

The firm incurs four broad classes of expenses: cost of goods sold, which is the direct cost attributable to producing the product sold by the firm; general and administrative expenses, which correspond to overhead expenses, salaries, advertising, and other costs of operating the firm that are not directly attributable to production; interest expense on the firm's debt; and taxes owed to federal and local governments.


Table 19.1 presents an income statement for Target. At the top are the company's revenues from operations. Next come operating expenses (i.e., the costs incurred in the course of generating those revenues, including a depreciation allowance). The difference between operating revenues and operating costs is called operating income. Income or expenses from other, primarily nonrecurring, sources are then added or subtracted to obtain earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which is what the firm would have earned if not for obligations to its creditors and the tax authorities. EBIT measures profitability abstracting from the interest burden attributable to debt financing. Next, we subtract net interest expense from EBIT to find taxable income. Finally, the income tax due the government is subtracted to arrive at net income, the "bottom line" of the income statement.

Analysts also commonly prepare a common-size income statement, in which all items on the income statement are expressed as a percent of total revenue. This makes it easier to compare firms of different sizes. The right-hand column of Table 19.1 is Target's common-size income statement.

In the previous chapter, we saw that stock valuation models require a measure of economic earnings—the sustainable cash flow that can be paid out to stockholders without impairing the productive capacity of the firm. In contrast, accounting earnings are affected by several conventions, among them, the valuation of assets such as inventories (e.g., LIFO versus FIFO treatment) and the way some expenditures such as capital investments are recognized over time (as depreciation expenses). We discuss questions raised by some of these accounting conventions in greater detail later in the chapter. In addition to these accounting issues, as the firm makes its way through the business cycle, its earnings will rise above or fall below the trend line that might more accurately reflect its sustainable economic earnings. This introduces an added complication in interpreting net income. Given all of these

In fact, financial statements clearly convey considerable information: Stock prices respond vigorously when firms announce earnings that differ from the prior expectations of market analysts or investors.

# The Balance Sheet

While the income statement provides a measure of profitability over a period of time, the balance sheet provides a "snapshot" of the financial condition of the firm at a particular moment. The balance sheet is a list of the firm's assets and liabilities. The difference in assets and liabilities is the net worth of the firm, also called shareholders' or stockholders' equity. Like income statements, balance sheets are reasonably standardized in presentation.

Table 19.2 is Target's balance sheet. The first section lists the firm's assets. Current assets are presented first. These are cash and other items such as accounts receivable or inventories that will be converted into cash within one year. Next comes a listing of long-term or "fixed" assets. Tangible fixed assets are items such as buildings, equipment, or vehicles. Target also has several intangible assets such as a respected brand name and expertise. But accountants generally are reluctant to include these assets on the balance sheet, as they are so hard to value. However, when one firm purchases another for a premium over its current market value (the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities), that difference, called "goodwill," is listed on the balance sheet as an intangible fixed asset. Target lists goodwill at  \ {633}  million.  {}^{1}  The sum of current and fixed assets is total assets,the last line of the assets section of the balance sheet.

The liability and shareholders' equity (also called stockholders' equity) section is arranged similarly. First come short-term, or "current," liabilities such as accounts payable and debts due within one year. Following this are long-term debt and other liabilities due in more than one year. The difference between total assets and total liabilities is stockholders' equity. This is the net worth, or book value, of the firm.

Stockholders' equity is divided into par value of stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, although this division is usually unimportant. Briefly, par value plus additional paid-in capital represent the proceeds realized from the sale of stock to the public. Conversely, when the firm repurchases stock from the public, this is treated as a "negative share issuance," and shareholders' equity falls. These repurchased shares are held in the company's treasury and are, therefore, known as treasury stock. The shares held by investors are said to be issued and outstanding. Target's par value plus paid-in capital is 6,371. Of course, considerable profits have been reinvested in the business on the shareholders' behalf, and this shows up as retained earnings in Table 19.2. The entry for retained earnings shows the cumulative buildup of equity from profits plowed back into the firm.

The entries in the left-hand columns of the balance sheet in Table 19.2 present the dollar value of each asset. Just as they compute common-size income statements, however, analysts also find it convenient to use common-size balance sheets when comparing firms of different sizes. Therefore, each item is also expressed as a percentage of total assets. These entries appear in the right-hand columns of Table 19.2.

<table><tr><td>Assets</td><td>$ million</td><td>Percent of total assets</td><td>Liabilities and shareholders&#x27; equity</td><td>$ million</td><td>Percent of total assets</td></tr><tr><td>Current assets</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash and marketable securities</td><td>8,511</td><td>16.6\%</td><td>Current liabilities</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Receivables</td><td>1,592</td><td>3.1\%</td><td>Debt due for repayment</td><td>1,144</td><td>2.2\%</td></tr><tr><td>Inventories</td><td>10,653</td><td>20.8\%</td><td>Accounts payable</td><td>12,859</td><td>25.1\%</td></tr><tr><td>Total current assets</td><td>20,756</td><td>40.5\%</td><td>Other current liabilities</td><td>6,122</td><td>11.9\%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Total current liabilities</td><td>20,125</td><td>39.3\%</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed Assets</td><td></td><td></td><td>Long-term debt</td><td>11,536</td><td>22.5\%</td></tr><tr><td>Tangible fixed assets</td><td></td><td></td><td>Other long-term liabilities</td><td>5,147</td><td>10.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>Property, plant, and equipment</td><td>26,879</td><td>52.4\%</td><td>Total liabilities</td><td>36,808</td><td>71.8\%</td></tr><tr><td>Other Long-term Assets</td><td>2,980</td><td>5.8\%</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total tangible fixed assets</td><td>29,859</td><td>58.3\%</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Shareholders&#x27; equity:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Intangible fixed assets</td><td></td><td></td><td>Common stock and other paid-in capital</td><td>6,371</td><td>12.4\%</td></tr><tr><td>Goodwill</td><td>633</td><td>1.2\%</td><td>Retained earnings</td><td>8,069</td><td>15.7\%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Total shareholders&#x27; equity</td><td>14,440</td><td>28.2\%</td></tr><tr><td>Total Fixed Assets</td><td>30,492</td><td>59.5\%</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Total liabilities and shareholders&#x27; equity</td><td>51,248</td><td>100.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>Total assets</td><td>51,248</td><td>100.0\%</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

Table 19.2

# The Statement of Cash Flows

The income statement and balance sheets are based on accrual methods of accounting, which means that revenues and expenses are recognized at the time of a sale even if no cash has yet been exchanged. In contrast, the statement of cash flows tracks the cash implications of transactions. For example, if goods are sold now, with payment due in 60 days, the income statement will treat the revenue as generated when the sale occurs, and the balance sheet will be immediately augmented by accounts receivable, but the statement of cash flows is concerned with when the bill is paid and the cash is in hand.

Table 19.3 is the statement of cash flows for Target. The first entry listed under "cash provided by operations" is net income. The next entries modify that figure for components of income that have been recognized but for which cash has not yet changed hands. For example, Target's accounts receivable increased by 299 million. This portion of sales was claimed on the income statement, but the cash had not yet been collected. Increases in accounts receivable are in effect an investment in working capital and, therefore, reduce the cash flows realized from operations. Similarly, increases in accounts payable mean that expenses have been recognized, but cash has not yet left the firm. Any payment delay increases the company's net cash flows in this period.

Another major difference between the income statement and the statement of cash flows involves depreciation, which is a major addition to income in the adjustment section of the statement of cash flows. The income statement attempts to "smooth" large capital expenditures over time. The depreciation expense does this by recognizing such expenditures over a period of many years rather than at the specific time of purchase. In contrast, the statement

<table><tr><td></td><td>$ Million</td></tr><tr><td>Cash provided by operations</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Net income</td><td>\$ 4,368</td></tr><tr><td>Adjustments to net income</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Depreciation</td><td>2,230</td></tr><tr><td>Changes in working capital</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Decrease (increase) in receivables</td><td>(299)</td></tr><tr><td>Decrease (increase) in inventories</td><td>(1,661)</td></tr><tr><td>Increase (decrease) in accounts payable</td><td>2,925</td></tr><tr><td>Increase (decrease) in other current liabilities</td><td>2,962</td></tr><tr><td>Total adjustments</td><td>\$ 6,157</td></tr><tr><td>Cash provided by operations</td><td>\$10,525</td></tr><tr><td>Cash flows from investments</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gross investment in tangible fixed assets</td><td>(2,649)</td></tr><tr><td>Investments in other assets</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>Cash provided by (used for) investments</td><td>(\$2,591)</td></tr><tr><td>Cash provided by (used for) financing activities</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Additions to (reductions in) long-term debt</td><td>\$ 65</td></tr><tr><td>Net issues (repurchases of) shares</td><td>(745)</td></tr><tr><td>Dividends</td><td>(1,343)</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>\$ 23</td></tr><tr><td>Cash provided by (used for) financing activities</td><td>(\$2,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Net increase in cash</td><td>5,934</td></tr></table>

Table 19.3

Statement of cash flows for Target of cash flows recognizes the cash implication of a capital expenditure when it occurs. Therefore, it adds back the depreciation "expense" that was used to compute net income; instead, it acknowledges a capital expenditure when it is paid. It does so by reporting cash flows separately for operations, investing, and financing activities. This way, any large cash flows, such as those for big investments, can be recognized without affecting the measure of cash provided by operations.


The second section of the statement of cash flows focuses on cash flows from investing activities. For example, Target used  \$2,649 million of cash investing in tangible fixed assets. On the other hand,\$ 58 million was freed up by disinvestments in other assets. These entries are investments in the assets necessary for the firm to maintain or enhance its productive capacity.

Finally, the last section of the statement lists the cash flows realized from financing activities. Issuance of securities will contribute positive cash flows, while repurchase or redemption of outstanding securities uses up cash. For example, Target expended  \$745 million to repurchase shares of its stock, which was a major use of cash. Its dividend payments,\$ 1,343 million, also used cash. In total, Target's financing activities absorbed 2,000 million.

To summarize, Target's operations generated a cash flow of  \$10,525 million. Some of that cash,\$ 2,591 million, went to pay for new investments. Another part, \$2,000 million, went to pay dividends and retire outstanding securities. Target's cash holdings therefore increased by 10,525 - 2,591 - 2,000 = \$5,934 million. This is reported on the last line of Table 19.3.

The statement of cash flows provides important evidence on the well-being of a firm. If a company cannot pay its dividends and maintain the productivity of its capital stock out of cash flow from operations, for example, and must resort to borrowing to meet these demands, this is a warning that it cannot maintain the dividend payout at its current level in the long run. The statement of cash flows will reveal this developing problem when it shows that cash flow from operations is inadequate and that borrowing is being used to maintain dividend payments at unsustainable levels.

# 19.2 Measuring Firm Performance

In Chapter 1, we pointed out that a natural goal of the firm is to maximize value but that various agency problems, or conflicts of interest, may impede that goal. How can we measure how well the firm is actually performing? Financial analysts have come up with a mind-numbing list of financial ratios that measure many aspects of firm performance. Before getting lost in the trees, let's first pause to consider what sorts of ratios may be related to the ultimate objective of added value.

Two broad activities are the responsibility of a firm's financial managers: investments and financing. Investment, or capital budgeting, decisions pertain to the firm's use of capital: the business activities in which it is engaged. Here, our concern is the profitability of those projects. How should profitability be measured? How does the acceptable level of profitability depend on risk and the opportunity cost of the funds used to pay for the firm's many projects? In contrast, financial decisions pertain to the firm's sources of capital. Is there a sufficient supply of financing to meet projected needs for growth? Does the financing plan rely too heavily on borrowed funds? Is there sufficient liquidity to deal with unexpected cash needs?

Figure 19.1 Important financial questions and some ratios that help answer them

These questions suggest that we organize financial ratios along the lines given in Figure 19.1. The figure shows that when evaluating the firm's investment activities, we ask two broad sets of questions. In the left panel, we ask how efficiently does the firm deploy its assets, and how profitable are its sales? In turn, aspects of both efficiency and profitability can be measured with several ratios. Efficiency is typically assessed using turnover ratios, while the profitability of sales is commonly measured with various profit margins. In the right panel, we evaluate the prudence of the firm's financing decisions, assessing both leverage and liquidity; aspects of each of these two concepts also can be measured with an array of statistics.

The next section explains how to calculate and interpret some of these key financial ratios and shows how many of them are related.

# 19.3 Profitability Measures

Big firms naturally earn greater profits than smaller ones. Therefore, most profitability measures focus on earnings per dollar employed. The most common measures are return on assets, return on capital, and return on equity.

# Return on Assets, ROA

Return on assets (ROA) equals earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) as a fraction of the firm's total assets.2

$$
\mathrm {R O A} = \frac {\mathrm {E B I T}}{\text {T o t a l a s s e t s}}
$$

The numerator of this ratio may be viewed (abstracting from one-off expenses or income sources) as the firm's operating income. Therefore, ROA tells us operating income per dollar deployed in the firm.

# Return on Capital, ROC

Whereas ROA compares EBIT to total assets, return on capital (ROC) expresses EBIT as a fraction of long-term capital (i.e., shareholders' equity plus long-term debt). It measures earnings per dollar of long-term capital invested in the firm.

$$
\mathrm {R O C} = \frac {\mathrm {E B I T}}{\text {L o n g - t e r m c a p i t a l}}
$$

# Return on Equity, ROE

Whereas ROA and ROC measure profitability relative to funds raised by both debt and equity financing, return on equity (ROE) focuses only on the profitability of equity investments. It equals net income realized by shareholders per dollar they have invested in the firm.

$$
\mathrm {R O E} = \frac {\text {N e t i n c o m e}}{\text {S h a r e h o l d s} ^ {\prime} \text {e q u i t y}}
$$

We saw in Chapter 18 that ROE is one of the two basic factors in determining a firm's growth rate of earnings. Sometimes it is reasonable to assume that future ROE will approximate its current value, but a high ROE in the past does not necessarily imply a firm's future ROE will be high. It can be dangerous to accept historical values as indicators of future values. While data from the recent past may provide information regarding expected performance, keep your focus on the future.

Not surprisingly, ROA and ROE are linked, but as we will see next, their relationship is affected by the firm's financial policies.

# Financial Leverage and ROE

ROE is affected by the firm's debt-equity mix as well as the interest rate on its debt. An example will show why. Suppose Nodett is a firm that is all-equity financed and has total assets of 100 million. Assume its corporate tax rate is 20\%. (The exact corporate tax rate in 2022 was 21\%).

Table 19.4 shows Nodett's sales, earnings before interest and taxes, and net profits under three scenarios representing phases of the business cycle. It also shows two of the most commonly used profitability measures: operating ROA, which equals EBIT/Assets, and ROE, which equals net profits/equity.

Somdett is an otherwise identical firm to Nodett, but it has financed  \$40 million of its\$ 100 million of assets with debt bearing an interest rate of 8\%. It therefore pays annual interest expenses of 3.2 million. Table 19.5 shows how Somdett's ROE differs from Nodett's.

Annual sales, EBIT, and therefore ROA for both firms are the same in each of the three scenarios; in other words, business risk for the two companies is identical. But their financial risk differs. Although Nodett and Somdett have the same ROA in each scenario, Somdett's ROE exceeds that of Nodett in normal and good years and is lower in bad years.

# Table 19.5

Impact of financial leverage on ROE

We can summarize the exact relationship among ROE, ROA, and leverage in the following equation:

$$
\mathrm {R O E} = (1 - \text {T a x r a t e}) \left[ \mathrm {R O A} + (\mathrm {R O A} - \text {I n t e r s t r a t e}) \frac {\text {D e b t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} \right] \tag {19.1}
$$

This result makes sense: If ROA exceeds the borrowing rate, the firm earns more on its investments than it pays out to creditors. The surplus earnings are available to the firm's equityholders, which increases ROE. If, on the other hand, ROA is less than the interest rate paid on debt, then ROE will decline by an amount that depends on the debt-to-equity ratio.

# Example 19.1 Leverage and ROE

To illustrate the application of Equation 19.1, look at Table 19.5. In a normal year, Nodett has an ROE of  $8\%$ , which is .8 (i.e., 1 minus the tax rate) times its ROA of  $10\%$ . However, Somdett, which borrows at an interest rate of  $8\%$  and maintains a debt-to-equity ratio of  $2/3$ , has an ROE of  $9.07\%$ . The calculation using Equation 19.1 is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {ROE} = . 8 [ 10 \% + (10 \% - 8 \%) ^ {2 / 3} ] \\ = .8[10\% +4 / 3\% ] = 9.07\% \\ \end{array}
$$

Somdett's debt makes a positive contribution to ROE in this scenario because the firm's ROA exceeds the interest rate on its debt.

Table 19.5 shows that financial leverage increases the risk of equityholder returns. Somdett's ROE is worse than Nodett's in bad years, but it is better in good years. The presence of debt makes Somdett's ROE more sensitive to the business cycle. Even though the two companies have equal business risk (reflected in their identical EBITs in all three scenarios), Somdett's stockholders bear greater financial risk than Nodett's because all of the firm's business risk is absorbed by a smaller base of equity investors.

3The derivation of Equation 19.1 is as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {R O E} = \frac {\text {N e t p r o f i t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} = \frac {\text {E B I T - I n t e r s t - T a x e s}}{\text {E q u i t y}} = \frac {(1 - \text {T a x r a t e}) (\text {E B I T - I n t e r s t})}{\text {E q u i t y}} \\ = (1 - \text {T a x r a t e}) \left[ \frac {\left(\mathrm {R O A} \times \text {A s s e t s}\right) - (\text {I n t e r e s t r a t e} \times \text {D e b t})}{\text {E q u i t y}} \right] \\ = (1 - \text {T a x r a t e}) \left[ \mathrm {R O A} \times \frac {\text {E q u i t y} + \text {D e b t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} - \text {I n t e r s t r a t e} \times \frac {\text {D e b t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} \right] \\ = (1 - \text {T a x r a t e}) \left[ \text {R O A} + (\text {R O A} - \text {I n t e r e s t r a t e}) \frac {\text {D e b t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

Even if financial leverage increases the expected ROE of Somdett relative to Nodett (as it seems to in Table 19.5), this does not imply that Somdett's share price will be higher. Financial leverage increases the risk of the firm's equity as surely as it raises the expected ROE, and the correspondingly higher discount rate will offset the higher expected earnings.

# Concept Check 19.1

Mordett has the same assets as Nodett and Somdett, but its debt-to-equity ratio is 1.0 and its interest rate is  $9\%$ . What will its net profit and ROE be in a bad year, a normal year, and a good year?

# Economic Value Added

While profitability measures such as ROA, ROC, and ROE are commonly used to measure performance, profitability is really not enough. A firm should be viewed as successful only if the return on its projects is better than the rate investors could expect to earn for themselves (on a risk-adjusted basis) in the capital market. Plowing back funds into the firm increases stock price only if the firm earns a higher rate of return on those funds than the opportunity cost of capital, that is, the market capitalization rate. To account for this opportunity cost, we can measure the success of the firm using the difference between the return on capital, ROC, and the opportunity cost of capital,  $k$ . Economic value added (EVA) is the spread between ROC and  $k$  multiplied by the capital invested in the firm. It therefore measures the dollar value of the firm's return in excess of its opportunity cost. Another term for EVA (the term coined by Stern Stewart, a consulting firm that has promoted its use) is residual income.

# Example 19.2 Economic Value Added

In 2021, Intel had a weighted-average cost of capital of  $6.26\%$  (based on its cost of debt, its capital structure, its equity beta, and estimates derived from the CAPM for the cost of equity). Its return on capital was  $9.27\%$ , which was  $3.01\%$  greater than the opportunity cost of capital on its investments in plant, equipment, and know-how. In other words, each dollar invested by Intel earned about 3.01 cents more than the return that investors could have anticipated by investing in equivalent-risk stocks. It earned this superior rate of return on a capital base of \$112.2 billion. Its economic value added, that is, its return in excess of opportunity cost, was therefore  $(.0927 - .0626) \times \$112.2 = \$3.38$  billion.

Table 19.6 shows EVA for a small sample of firms. $^{4}$  The EVA leader in this sample was Apple, whose large EVA resulted from an extremely high ROC applied to an enormous capital base. But now compare Intel to Coca-Cola. Both firms had almost identical margins between ROC and cost of capital. Yet Intel's EVA was nearly four times that of Coke. This is because Intel applied its margin to a much larger capital base. At the other extreme, Ford and AT&T earned less than their opportunity costs of capital, which resulted in negative EVAs.

Notice that even the EVA "losers" in Table 19.6 reported positive accounting profits. For example, by conventional standards, AT&T was solidly profitable, with a positive ROC of  $3.51\%$ . But its cost of capital was higher, at  $4.99\%$ . By this standard, it did not

4Actual EVA estimates reported by Stern Stewart differ from the values in Table 19.6 because of adjustments to the accounting data involving issues such as treatment of research and development expenses, taxes, advertising expenses, and depreciation. The estimates in Table 19.6 show the logic behind EVA but must be taken as imprecise.

Table 19.6

Economic value added, 2021 cover its opportunity cost of capital and, therefore, returned a negative EVA. EVA treats the opportunity cost of capital as a real cost that should be deducted from revenues to arrive at a more meaningful "bottom line." A firm that is generating accounting profits but not covering its opportunity cost might be able to redeploy its capital to better uses. Therefore, many firms calculate EVA and tie managers' compensation to it.


On the other hand, while EVA has many advantages over return on capital as a means of evaluating management, it is not perfect. Notice Walt Disney's large negative EVA in 2021. This largely reflected the impact of COVID-19 on theme park revenues, and it would seem inappropriate to hold management responsible for that. Still, EVA does reflect the opportunity cost borne by shareholders, regardless of where the blame lies.

# 19.4 Ratio Analysis

# Decomposition of ROE

To understand the factors affecting a firm's ROE, particularly its trend over time and its performance relative to competitors, analysts often "decompose" ROE into the product of a series of ratios. Each component ratio is in itself meaningful, and the process serves to focus the analyst's attention on the separate factors influencing performance. This kind of decomposition of ROE is often called the DuPont system.

One useful decomposition of ROE is

$$
\mathrm {R O E} = \frac {\text {N e t p r o f i t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} = \frac {\text {N e t p r o f i t s}}{\text {P r e t a x p r o f i t s}} \times \frac {\text {P r e t a x p r o f i t s}}{\text {E B I T}} \times \frac {\text {E B I T}}{\text {S a l e s}} \times \frac {\text {S a l e s}}{\text {A s s e t s}} \times \frac {\text {A s s e t s}}{\text {E q u i t y}} \tag {19.2}
$$

(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)

Table 19.7 shows these ratios for Nodett and Somdett in each of the three economic scenarios. Let us first focus on factors 3 and 4. Notice that their product equals EBIT/Assets, which is the firm's ROA.

Factor 3 is known as the firm's operating profit margin or return on sales (ROS), which equals operating profit per dollar of sales. In a normal year, profit margin is .10, or  $10\%$ ; in a bad year, it is .0625, or  $6.25\%$ ; and in a good year, it is .125, or  $12.5\%$ .

Ratio decomposition analysis for Nodett and Somdett

Table 19.7

Factor 4, the ratio of sales to total assets, is known as total asset turnover (ATO). It measures the annual sales generated by each dollar of assets, so it is widely interpreted as a measure of the efficiency with which the firm uses its assets. In a normal year, ATO for both firms is 1.0 per year, meaning that sales of 1 per year were generated per dollar of assets. In a bad year, this ratio declines to .8 per year, and in a good year, it rises to 1.2 per year.

Comparing Nodett and Somdett, we see that factors 3 and 4 do not depend on a firm's financial leverage. The firms' ratios equal each other in each scenario. Similarly, factor 1, the ratio of net income after taxes to pretax profit, is the same for both firms. We call this the tax-burden ratio. Its value reflects both the government's tax code and the policies pursued by the firm in trying to minimize its tax burden. In our example, it does not change over the business cycle, remaining a constant .8.

Although factors 1, 3, and 4 are not affected by a firm's capital structure, factors 2 and 5 are. Factor 2 is the ratio of pretax profits to EBIT. The firm's pretax profits are greatest when there are no interest payments owed to debtholders. In fact, another way to express this ratio is

$$
\frac {\text {P r e t a x p r o f i t s}}{\text {E B I T}} = \frac {\text {E B I T} - \text {I n t e r e s t e x p e n s e}}{\text {E B I T}}
$$

We call this factor the interest-burden ratio. It takes on its highest possible value, 1, for Nodett, which has no debt and therefore no interest expense. The higher the degree of financial leverage, the lower the interest-burden ratio. Nodett's ratio does not vary over the business cycle. It is fixed at 1.0, reflecting the absence of interest payments. For Somdett, however, because interest expense is fixed while EBIT varies, the interest burden ratio varies from a low of .36 in a bad year to a high of .787 in a good year.

A closely related statistic to the interest-burden ratio is the interest coverage ratio, or times interest earned. The ratio is defined as

A high coverage ratio indicates that annual earnings are significantly greater than annual interest obligations. It is widely used by both lenders and borrowers in determining the firm's debt capacity and is a major determinant of the firm's bond rating.

Factor 5, the ratio of assets to equity, is a measure of the firm's degree of financial leverage. It is called the leverage ratio and is equal to 1 plus the total debt-to-equity ratio. As shown in Table 19.7, Nodett has a leverage ratio of 1, while Somdett's leverage ratio is 1.667.

From our discussion in Section 19.2, we know that financial leverage boosts ROE only if ROA is greater than the interest rate on the firm's debt. How is this fact reflected in the ratios of Table 19.7?

The full impact of leverage equals the product of the interest burden and leverage ratios (i.e., factors 2 and 5 in Table 19.7). This product is called the compound leverage factor and is shown in Column 6. Nodett's compound leverage factor equals 1.0 in all three scenarios. In contrast, Somdett's compound leverage factor is greater than 1.0 in normal years (1.133) and in good years (1.311), indicating a positive contribution of financial leverage to ROE. It is less than 1 in bad years, reflecting the fact that when ROA falls below the interest rate, ROE falls with increased use of debt.

We can summarize all of these relationships as follows. From Equation 19.2,

ROE = Tax burden × Interest burden × Margin × Turnover × Leverage

Because

$$
\mathrm {R O A} = \text {M a r g i n} \times \text {T u r n o v e r} \tag {19.3}
$$ and


Compound leverage factor  $=$  Interest burden  $\times$  Leverage we can decompose ROE equivalently as follows:


$$
\mathrm {R O E} = \text {T a x b u r d e n} \times \mathrm {R O A} \times \text {C o m p o u n d l e v e r a g e f a c t o r} \tag {19.4}
$$

Equation 19.3 shows that ROA is the product of margin and turnover. High values of one of these ratios are often accompanied by low values of the other. For example, Walmart has low profit margins but high turnover, while the luxury brand firm LVMH has high margins but low turnover. Firms would love to have high values for both margin and turnover, but this generally will not be possible: Retailers with high markups will sacrifice sales volume, while those with low turnover need high margins just to remain viable. Therefore, comparing these ratios in isolation usually is meaningful only in evaluating firms following similar strategies in the same industry.

Figure 19.2 shows evidence of the turnover-profit margin trade-off. Each point in the figure corresponds to the profit margin-turnover pair for one particular industry. Industries with high turnover, such as retail stores, tend to have low profit margins, while industries with high margins, such as utilities, tend to have low turnover. The two curved lines trace out turnover-margin combinations that result in an ROA of either  $2\%$  or  $10\%$ . You can see that most industries lie inside of this range, so ROA across industries demonstrates far less variation than either turnover or margin taken in isolation.

$$
\frac {{} ^ {5} \text {A s s e t s}}{\text {E q u i t y}} = \frac {\text {E q u i t y} + \text {D e b t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} = 1 + \frac {\text {D e b t}}{\text {E q u i t y}}
$$

# Example 19.3 Margin versus Turnover

Consider two firms with the same ROA of  $10\%$  per year. The first is a discount chain; the second is a gas and electric utility.

As Table 19.8 shows, the discount chain has a "low" profit margin of  $2\%$  and achieves a  $10\%$  ROA by "turning over" its assets five times per year. The capital-intensive utility, in contrast, has a "low" asset turnover ratio of only .5 time per year and achieves its  $10\%$  ROA through its higher profit margin of  $20\%$ . We see that a "low" margin or asset turnover ratio need not indicate a troubled firm. Each ratio must be interpreted in light of industry norms.

Prepare a ratio decomposition analysis for the Mordett firm in Concept Check 19.1, creating a table similar to Table 19.7.

# Turnover and Other Asset Utilization Ratios

To understand a firm's ratio of sales to assets, it is often helpful to compute comparable efficiency-of-utilization, or turnover, ratios for subcategories of assets. For example, we can think about turnover relative to fixed rather than total assets:

$$
\text {F i x e d - a s s e t t u r n o v e r} = \frac {\text {S a l e s}}{\text {F i x e d a s s e t s}}
$$

This ratio measures sales per dollar of the firm's investments in fixed assets.

To illustrate how you can compute this and other ratios from a firm's financial statements, consider Growth Industries, Inc. (GI). GI's historical income statement and opening and closing balance sheets for the years 2020-2023 appear in Table 19.9. (To work with round numbers in this example, we round corporate tax from the actual rate,  $21\%$ , to  $20\%$ .)

GI's total asset turnover in 2023 was .303 (calculated as annual sales divided by average of start- and end-of-year assets), which was below the industry average of .4. To understand better why GI underperformed, we can compute asset utilization ratios separately for fixed assets, inventories, and accounts receivable.

GI's sales in 2023 were 144 million. Its only fixed assets were plant and equipment, which were 216 million at the beginning of the year and \$259.2 million at year's end. Average fixed assets for the year were, therefore, 237.6 million [(216 million + \$259.2 million)/2]. GI's fixed-asset turnover for 2023 therefore was 144 million per year/237.6 million = .606 per year. In other words, for every dollar of fixed assets, there was $.606 in sales.

Notice that when a financial ratio includes one item from the income statement, which covers a period of time, and another from a balance sheet, which is a "snapshot" at a particular time, common practice is to take the average of the beginning- and end-of-year balance sheet figures. Thus, in computing the fixed-asset turnover ratio, we divide sales (from the income statement) by average fixed assets (from the balance sheet).

Comparable figures for the fixed-asset turnover ratio for 2021–2023 and the 2023 industry average are:

<table><tr><td>2021</td><td>2022</td><td>2023</td><td>2023 Industry Average</td></tr><tr><td>0.606</td><td>0.606</td><td>0.606</td><td>0.700</td></tr></table>

GI's fixed asset turnover has been stable over time and below the industry average.

Another widely followed turnover ratio is the inventory turnover ratio, which is the ratio of cost of goods sold per dollar of average inventory. (We use the cost of goods sold instead of sales revenue in the numerator to maintain consistency with inventory, which is valued at cost.)

Growth Industries, Inc., financial statements (\$ thousand)

In 2021, GI's cost of goods sold was  \$45 million, and its average inventory was\$ 82.5 million [(\$75 million + \$90 million)/2]. Its inventory turnover was, therefore, .545 per year (\$45 million/\$82.5 million). In 2022 and 2023, inventory turnover remained the same, which was below the industry average of .5 per year. In other words, GI was burdened with a higher level of inventories relative to production than its competitors. This higher investment in working capital in turn resulted in a higher level of assets per dollar of sales or profits and a lower ROA than its competitors.

Another aspect of efficiency surrounds management of accounts receivable, which is often measured by days sales in receivables, that is, the average level of accounts receivable expressed as a multiple of daily sales. It is computed as average accounts receivable/ sales  $\times 365$  and may be interpreted as the number of days' worth of sales tied up in accounts receivable. You can also think of it as the average lag between the date of sale and the date payment is received; therefore, it is also called the average collection period.

For GI in 2023, the average collection period was 100.4 days:

$$
\frac {(\$ 3 6 \text {m i l l o n} + \$ 4 3 . 2 \text {m i l l o n}) / 2}{\$ 1 4 4 \text {m i l l o n}} \times 3 6 5 = 1 0 0. 4 \text {d a y s}
$$

The industry average was only 60 days. This statistic tells us that GI's average receivables per dollar of sales exceeds that of its competitors. Again, this implies a higher required investment in working capital and, ultimately, a lower ROA.

In summary, these ratios show us that GI's poor total asset turnover relative to the industry is in part caused by lower-than-average fixed-asset turnover and inventory turnover and higher-than-average days receivables. This suggests GI may have excess plant capacity as well as poor inventory and receivables management practices.

# Liquidity Ratios

Leverage is one measure of the safety of a firm's debt. Debt ratios compare the firm's indebtedness to various measures of its assets, and coverage ratios compare measures of earning power against the cash flow needed to satisfy debt obligations. But leverage is not the only determinant of financial prudence. You also want to know that a firm can lay its hands on cash either to pay its scheduled obligations or to meet unforeseen obligations. Liquidity is the ability to convert assets into cash at short notice. Liquidity is commonly measured using the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio.

1. Current ratio: Current assets/Current liabilities. This ratio measures the ability of the firm to pay off its current liabilities by liquidating its current assets (i.e., turning them into cash). It indicates the firm's ability to avoid insolvency in the short run. GI's current ratio in 2021, for example, was  $(60 + 30 + 90) / (36 + 87.4) = 1.46$ . In other years, it was

<table><tr><td>2021</td><td>2022</td><td>2023</td><td>2023 Industry Average</td></tr><tr><td>1.46</td><td>1.16</td><td>0.95</td><td>2.0</td></tr></table>

This represents an unfavorable time trend and poor standing relative to the industry. This troublesome pattern is not surprising given the working capital burden resulting from GI's subpar performance with respect to receivables and inventory management.

2. Quick ratio: (Cash + Marketable securities + Receivables)/Current liabilities. This ratio is also called the acid test ratio. It has the same denominator as the current ratio, but its numerator includes only cash, cash equivalents, and receivables. The quick ratio is a better measure of liquidity than the current ratio for firms whose inventory is not readily convertible into cash. GI's quick ratio shows the same disturbing trends as its current ratio:

<table><tr><td>2021</td><td>2022</td><td>2023</td><td>2023 Industry Average</td></tr><tr><td>0.73</td><td>0.58</td><td>0.48</td><td>1.0</td></tr></table>

3. Cash ratio. A company's receivables are less liquid than its holdings of cash and marketable securities. Therefore, in addition to the quick ratio, analysts also compute a firm's cash ratio, defined as

$$
\text {C a s h} = \frac {\text {C a s h} + \text {M a r k e t a b l e s e c u r i t i e s}}{\text {C u r r e n t} \text {l i a b i l i t i e s}}
$$

GI's cash ratios are

<table><tr><td>2021</td><td>2022</td><td>2023</td><td>2023 Industry Average</td></tr><tr><td>0.486</td><td>0.386</td><td>0.318</td><td>0.70</td></tr></table>

GI's liquidity ratios have fallen dramatically over this 3-year period, and by 2023, its liquidity measures are far below industry averages. The decline in the liquidity ratios combined with the decline in the coverage ratio (you can confirm that times interest earned has also fallen over this period) suggests that its credit rating has been declining as well, and, no doubt, GI is considered a relatively poor credit risk in 2023.

# Market Price Ratios: Growth versus Value

The market-book-value (P/B) ratio equals the market price of a share of the firm's common stock divided by its book value, that is, shareholders' equity per share. Some analysts consider the stock of a firm with a low market-book-value ratio to be a "safer" investment, seeing the book value as a "floor" supporting the market price. These analysts presumably view book value as the level below which market price will not fall because the firm always has the option to liquidate, or sell, its assets for their book values. However, this view is questionable. In fact, firms sometimes do sell below book value. For example, in 2022, shares in Citigroup, Honda, and Mitsubishi sold for less than book value. Nevertheless, a low market-book-value ratio is seen by some as providing a "margin of safety," and some analysts will screen out high-P/B firms in their stock selection process.

A better interpretation of the market-price-to-book-value ratio is as a measure of growth opportunities. Recall from the previous chapter that we may view the two components of firm value as assets in place and growth opportunities. As Example 19.4 illustrates, firms with greater growth opportunities will tend to exhibit higher multiples of market price to book value.

# Example 19.4 Market-Price-to-Book-Value Ratio and Growth Options

Consider two firms, both with book value per share of 10, both with a market capitalization rate of 15\%, and both with plowback ratios of .60.

Bright Prospects has an ROE of 20\%, which is well in excess of its market capitalization rate; this ROE implies that the firm is endowed with ample growth opportunities. With ROE = .20, Bright Prospects will earn \$2 per share this year. With its plowback ratio of .60, it pays out a dividend of D_{1} = (1 - .6) \times \2 = \80, has a growth rate of g = b \times ROE = .60 \times .20 = .12, and has a stock price of D_{1} / (k - g) = \80 / (.15 - .12) = \$26.67. Its price-book ratio is 26.67/10 = 2.667.

In contrast, Past Glory has an ROE of only 15\%, just equal to the market capitalization rate. It therefore will earn \$1.50 per share this year and will pay a dividend of D₁ = .4 × $1.50 = $.60. Its growth rate is g = b × ROE = .60 × .15 = .09, and its stock price is D₁/(k - g) = $.60/ (.15 - .09) = $10. Its price-book ratio is \$10/10 = 1.0. Not surprisingly, a firm that earns just the required rate of return on its investments will sell for book value, and no more.

We conclude that the market-price-to-book-value ratio is determined in large part by growth prospects.

Another measure used to place firms along a growth versus value spectrum is the price-earnings (P/E) ratio. In fact, we saw in the last chapter that the ratio of the present value of growth options to the value of assets in place largely determines the P/E multiple. While low-P/E stocks allow you to pay less per dollar of current earnings, the high-P/E stock may still be a better bargain if its earnings are expected to grow quickly enough.[6]

Remember, though, P/E ratios reported in the financial press are based on past earnings, while price is determined by the firm's prospects of future earnings. Therefore, reported P/E ratios may reflect variation in current earnings around a trend line.

Many analysts nevertheless believe that low-P/E stocks are more attractive than high-P/E stocks. And, in fact, low-P/E stocks have generally been positive-alpha investments using the CAPM as a return benchmark. But an efficient market adherent would discount this track record, arguing that such a simplistic rule could not really generate abnormal returns, and that the CAPM may not be a good benchmark for returns in this case.

In any event, the important points to keep in mind are that ownership of the stock conveys the right to future as well as current earnings and, therefore, that a high P/E ratio may best be interpreted as a signal that the market views the firm as enjoying attractive growth opportunities.

Before leaving the P/B and P/E ratios, it is worth pointing out an important relationship between them:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {R O E} = \frac {\text {E a r n i n g s}}{\text {B o o k v a l u e}} = \frac {\text {M a r k e t p r i c e}}{\text {B o o k v a l u e}} \div \frac {\text {M a r k e t p r i c e}}{\text {E a r n i n g s}} \tag {19.5} \\ = \mathrm {P} / \mathrm {B} \text {r a t i o} \div \mathrm {P} / \mathrm {E} \text {r a t i o} \\ \end{array}
$$

Rearranging these terms, we find that a firm's P/E ratio equals its price-to-book ratio divided by ROE:

$$
\frac {\mathrm {P}}{\mathrm {E}} = \frac {\mathrm {P} / \mathrm {B}}{\mathrm {R O E}}
$$

Thus, a company with a high P/B ratio can still have a relatively low P/E ratio if its ROE is sufficiently high.

Wall Street often distinguishes between "good firms" and "good investments." A good firm may be highly profitable, with a high ROE. But if its stock price is bid up to a level commensurate with this ROE, its P/B ratio will also be high, and the stock price may be a relatively large multiple of earnings, thus reducing its attractiveness as an investment. The high ROE of the firm does not by itself imply that the stock is a good investment. Conversely, troubled firms with low ROEs can be good investments if their prices are low enough.

Table 19.10 summarizes the ratios reviewed in this section.

What were GI's ROE, P/E, and P/B ratios in the year 2023? How do they compare to the industry average ratios, which were ROE = 8.64\%; P/E = 12; P/B = 1.10? How does GI's earnings yield in 2023 compare to the industry average?

# Choosing a Benchmark

We have discussed how to calculate the principal financial ratios. To evaluate the performance of a given firm, however, you need a benchmark to which you can compare its ratios. One obvious benchmark is the ratio for the same company in earlier years. For example, Figure 19.3 shows Target's return on assets, profit margin, and asset turnover ratios since 2008. You can see that the company has benefitted from a steady rise in its turnover ratio. In 2011-2013, however, the profit margin declined, leading to a drop in ROA. But after 2013, both profit margin and turnover increased in tandem, producing a dramatic increase in ROA.

It is also helpful to compare financial ratios to those of other firms in the same industry. Financial ratios for industries are published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Dun & Bradstreet (Industry Norms and Key Business Ratios), and the Risk Management Association, or RMA (Annual Statement Studies). A broad range of financial ratios is also easily accessible on the Web.

But be aware that while some ratios, such as asset turnover or the total debt ratio, reflect stable firm and industry characteristics and therefore tend to be correspondingly stable over time, others, such as return on assets or equity, are more sensitive to current business conditions.

# 19.5 An Illustration of Financial Statement Analysis

In her 2023 annual report to the shareholders of Growth Industries, Inc., the president wrote: "2023 was another successful year for Growth Industries. As in 2022, sales, assets, and operating income all continued to grow at a rate of  $20\%$ ."

Is she right?

The president is certainly correct about the growth rate in sales, assets, and operating income. But GI's key ratios, presented in Table 19.12, contradict her first sentence: 2023 was not another successful year for GI—it appears to have been another miserable one.

ROE has been declining rapidly, from  $7.45\%$  in 2021 to  $0.61\%$  in 2023. A comparison of GI's 2023 ROE to the 2023 industry average of  $8.64\%$  makes the deteriorating time trend appear especially alarming. The low and falling market-to-book-value ratio and the falling price-earnings ratio indicate investors are less and less optimistic about the firm's future profitability.

The fact that ROA has not been declining, however, tells us that the source of the declining time trend in GI's ROE must be related to financial leverage. And we see that as GI's leverage ratio (column 5) climbed from 2.23 in 2021 to 3.03 in 2023, its interest-burden ratio (column 2) worsened, from .580 to .036, with the net result that the compound leverage factor fell from 1.292 to .109.

The rapid increase in short-term debt from year to year and the concurrent increase in interest expense (see Table 19.9) make it clear that to finance its  $20\%$  growth rate in sales, GI has incurred sizable amounts of short-term debt at high interest rates. The firm is paying rates of interest greater than the ROA it is earning on the investment financed with the new borrowing. As leverage has increased and GI's financial situation has become evermore precarious, the rate it pays on new borrowing has increased dramatically. Between 2021 and 2023, the interest rate paid on short-term debt has increased from  $10\%$  to  $20\%$ . (See lower panel of Table 19.9.)

GI's problems become clear when we examine its statement of cash flows in Table 19.13. The statement is derived from the income statement and balance sheet data in Table 19.9. GI's cash flow from operations is falling steadily, from  $12,600,000 in 2021 to$ 2,482 in 2023. The firm's investment in plant and equipment, by contrast, has increased greatly. Net plant and equipment (i.e., net of depreciation) rose from  $150,000,000 in 2020 to$ 259,200,000 in 2023 (see Table 19.9). This near doubling of capital assets makes the decrease in cash flow from operations all the more troubling.

# Table 19.13

${}^{a}$  Gross investment equals increase in net plant and equipment plus depreciation.
bWe can conclude that no dividends are paid because stockholders' equity increases each year by the full amount of net income.
Issues of short-term debt = investment in plant & equipment plus increases in cash balances minus cash provided by operations.
dIncrease in cash matches the increase from the balance sheet.

The source of the difficulty is GI's enormous amount of short-term borrowing. In a sense, the company is being run as a pyramid scheme. It borrows more and more each year to maintain its  $20\%$  growth rate in assets and income. However, the new assets are not generating enough cash flow to support the extra interest burden of the debt, as the falling cash flow from operations indicates. Eventually, when the firm loses its ability to borrow further, its growth will be at an end.

At this point, GI stock might be an attractive investment. Table 19.12 shows that its market price is only  $5\%$  of its book value. GI is a likely candidate for a takeover by another firm that might replace its management and build shareholder value through a radical change in policy.

# 19.6 Comparability Problems

Financial statement analysis gives us a good amount of ammunition for evaluating a company's performance and future prospects. But comparing financial results of different companies is not so simple. There is more than one acceptable way to represent various items of revenue and expense according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This means two firms may have exactly the same economic income yet very different accounting incomes.

Interpreting a single firm's performance over time is even more complicated when inflation distorts the dollar measuring rod. Comparability problems are especially acute in this case because the impact of inflation on reported results often depends on the particular method the firm adopts to account for inventories and depreciation. Earnings and financial ratios must be adjusted to a uniform standard before comparing financial results across firms and over time. Other important potential sources of noncomparability include the capitalization of leases and other expenses, the treatment of pension costs, and allowances for reserves.

# Inventory Valuation

There are two commonly used ways to value inventories: LIFO (last-in, first-out) and FIFO (first-in, first-out). We can explain the difference using a numerical example.

Suppose Generic Products, Inc. (GPI), has a constant inventory of 1 million units of generic goods. The inventory turns over once per year, meaning the ratio of cost of goods sold to inventory is 1.

The LIFO system calls for valuing the million units used up during the year at the current cost of production, so that the last goods produced are considered the first ones to be sold. They are valued at today's cost. The FIFO system assumes that the units used up or sold are the ones that were added to inventory first, and goods sold are therefore valued at original cost. If the price of Generic goods has been constant, say at the level of  \$1, the book value of inventory and the cost of goods sold will be the same,\$ 1 million under both systems. But suppose the price of Generic goods rises by 10 cents per unit during the year as a result of general inflation. Under LIFO, the last goods produced are assumed to be sold at the current cost of \$1.10; the goods remaining are the previously produced goods, at a cost of only \$1.

Therefore, LIFO accounting would result in a cost of goods sold of  \$1.1 million, whereas the end-of-year balance sheet value of the 1 million units in inventory remains\$ 1 million. The balance sheet value of inventories is calculated as the cost of the goods still in inventory. You can see that although LIFO accounting accurately measures the cost of goods sold today, it understates the current value of the remaining inventory in an inflationary environment.

In contrast, under FIFO accounting, the cost of goods sold would be  \$1 million, and the end-of-year balance sheet value of the inventory would be\$ 1.1 million. The result is that the LIFO firm has both a lower reported profit and a lower balance sheet value of inventories (and therefore a lower estimate of total assets and book value of equity) than the FIFO firm. Therefore, profitability measures such as ROE, which equals the ratio of profits to book value of equity (both of which are underestimated), can be either higher or lower under LIFO than FIFO.

LIFO results in a more realistic estimate of economic earnings (i.e., real sustainable cash flow) because it uses up-to-date prices to evaluate the cost of goods sold. However, it induces balance sheet distortions when it values investment in inventories at original cost.

This practice results in an upward bias in ROE compared to an ideal economic measure: While economic earnings are more accurately measured using LIFO, the investment base on which return is earned is systematically undervalued, at least during periods of inflation.

# Depreciation

Another source of problems is the measurement of depreciation, which is a key factor in computing earnings. The accounting and economic measures of depreciation can differ markedly. According to the economic definition, depreciation is the amount the firm must reinvest to sustain its real productive capacity at the current level. The accounting measurement is quite different. Accounting depreciation is the portion of the original acquisition cost of an asset allocated in each period over an arbitrarily specified life of the asset. This is the figure reported in financial statements.

The United States actually allows two sets of depreciation treatments. For tax reporting, it currently allows the entire investment to be written off immediately, thus offering the firm a tax break equal to the corporate tax rate,  $21\%$ , times the investment. However, for reporting purposes, firms are more likely to depreciate an investment smoothly over some assumed lifetime, for example, using straight-line depreciation.

Assume, for example, that a firm buys machines with a useful economic life of 20 years at  \$100,000 apiece. In its financial statements, however, the firm depreciates the machines over 10 years using the straight-line method, for\$ 10,000 per year in depreciation. Thus, after 10 years a machine will be fully depreciated on the books, even though it remains a productive asset that will not need replacement for another 10 years.

In computing accounting earnings, this firm will overestimate depreciation in the first 10 years of the machine's economic life and underestimate it in the last 10 years. This will cause reported earnings to be understated compared with economic earnings in the first 10 years and overstated in the last 10 years.

Depreciation comparability problems add one more wrinkle. A firm can use different depreciation methods for tax purposes than for other reporting purposes. Most firms use accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes and straight-line depreciation in published financial statements. There also are differences across firms in their estimates of the depreciable life of plant, equipment, and other depreciable assets.

Another complication arises from inflation. Because conventional depreciation is based on historical costs rather than on the current replacement cost of assets, measured depreciation in periods of inflation is understated relative to replacement cost, and real economic income (sustainable cash flow) is correspondingly overstated.

For example, suppose Generic Products, Inc., has a machine with a 3-year useful life that originally cost  \$3 million. Annual straight-line depreciation is\$ 1 million, regardless of what happens to the replacement cost of the machine. Suppose inflation in the first year turns out to be 10\%. Then the true annual depreciation expense is \$1.1 million in current terms, whereas conventionally measured depreciation remains fixed at \$1 million per year. Accounting income overstates real economic income by $.1 million.

# Inflation and Interest Expense

Inflation has perhaps an even greater effect on the calculation of real interest expense. Nominal interest rates include an inflation premium that compensates the lender for inflation-induced erosion in the real value of principal. From the perspective of both lender and borrower, therefore, part of what is conventionally measured as interest expense should be treated more properly as repayment of principal.

# Example 19.5 Inflation and Real Income

Suppose Generic Products has debt outstanding with a face value of 10 million at an interest rate of 10\% per year. Interest expense as conventionally measured is 1 million per year. However, suppose inflation during the year is 6\%, so that the real interest rate is 4\%. Then .6 million of what appears as interest expense on the income statement is really an inflation premium, or compensation for the anticipated reduction in the real value of the \$10 million principal; only $.4 million is real interest expense. The $.6 million reduction in the purchasing power of the outstanding principal may be thought of as repayment of principal, rather than as an interest expense. Real income of the firm is, therefore, understated by .6 million.

Mismeasurement of real interest means inflation results in an underestimate of real income. The effects of inflation on the reported values of inventories and depreciation that we have discussed work in the opposite direction.

# Concept Check 19.5

In a period of rapid inflation, companies ABC and XYZ have the same reported earnings. ABC uses LIFO inventory accounting, has relatively fewer depreciable assets, and has more debt than XYZ. XYZ uses FIFO inventory accounting. Which company has the higher real income, and why?

# Fair Value Accounting

Many major assets and liabilities are not traded in financial markets and do not have easily observable values. For example, we cannot simply look up the values of employee stock options, health care benefits for retired employees, or buildings and other real estate. While the true financial status of a firm may depend critically on these values, which can swing widely over time, common practice has been to simply value them at historic cost. Proponents of fair value accounting, also known as mark-to-market accounting, argue that financial statements give a truer picture of the firm when they better reflect the current market values of all assets and liabilities.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement No. 157 on fair value accounting places assets in one of three "buckets." Level 1 assets are traded in active markets and therefore should be valued at their market price. Level 2 assets are not actively traded, but their values still may be estimated using observable market data on similar assets. They can be "marked to a matrix" of comparable securities. Level 3 assets are hardest to value. Here it is difficult even to identify other assets that are similar enough to serve as benchmarks for their market values; one has to resort to pricing models to estimate their intrinsic values. Rather than mark to market, these values are often called "mark to model," although they are also disparagingly known as mark-to-make-believe, as the estimates are so prone to manipulation by creative use of model inputs. Since 2012, firms have been required to disclose more about the methods and assumptions used in their valuation models and to describe the sensitivity of their valuation estimates to changes in their methodology.

Critics of fair value accounting argue that it relies too heavily on estimates. Such estimates potentially introduce considerable noise in firms' accounts and can induce profit volatility as fluctuations in asset valuations are recognized. Even worse, subjective valuations may offer management a tempting tool to manipulate earnings or the apparent financial condition of the firm at opportune times. As just one example, Bergstresser,

As banks and other institutions holding mortgage-backed securities revalued their portfolios throughout 2008, their net worth fell along with the value of those securities. The losses on these securities were painful enough, but their further implications only increased the banks' woes. For example, banks are required to maintain adequate levels of capital relative to assets. If capital reserves decline, a bank may be forced to shrink until its remaining capital is once again adequate compared to its asset base. But such shrinkage may require the bank to cut back on its lending, which restricts its customers' access to credit. It may also require asset sales, and if many banks attempt to shrink their portfolios at once, waves of forced sales may put further pressure on prices, resulting in additional write-downs and reductions to capital in a self-feeding cycle. Critics of mark-to-market accounting therefore contend that it exacerbated the problems of an already reeling economy.

Advocates, however, argue that the critics confuse the message with the messenger. Mark-to-market accounting makes transparent losses that have already been incurred, but it does not cause those losses. Critics retort that when markets are faltering, market prices may be unreliable. If trading activity has largely broken down, and assets can be sold only at fire-sale prices, then those prices may no longer be indicative of fundamental value. Markets cannot be efficient if they are not even functioning. In the turmoil surrounding the defaulted mortgages weighing down bank portfolios, one of the early proposals of then—Treasury secretary Henry Paulson was for the government to buy bad assets at "hold to maturity" prices based on estimates of intrinsic value in a normally functioning market. In that spirit, FASB approved new guidelines in 2009 allowing valuation based on an estimate of the price that would prevail in an orderly market rather than the one that could be received in a forced liquidation.


Waiving write-down requirements may best be viewed as thinly veiled regulatory forbearance. Regulators know that losses have been incurred and that capital has been impaired. But by allowing firms to carry assets on their books at model rather than market prices, the unpleasant implications of that fact for capital adequacy may be politely ignored for a time. Even so, if the goal is to avoid forced sales in a distressed market, transparency may nevertheless be the best policy. Better to acknowledge losses and explicitly modify capital regulations to help institutions recover their footing in a difficult economy than to deal with losses by ignoring them. After all, why bother preparing financial statements if they are allowed to obscure the true condition of the firm?

Before abandoning fair value accounting, it would be prudent to consider the alternative. Traditional historic-cost accounting, which would allow firms to carry assets on the books at their original purchase price, has even less to recommend it. It would leave investors without an accurate sense of the condition of shaky institutions, and by the same token lessen the pressure on those firms to get their houses in order. Dealing with losses must surely require acknowledging them.

Desai, and Rauh find that firms make more aggressive assumptions about returns on defined benefit pension plans (which lowers the computed present value of pension obligations) during periods in which executives are actively exercising their stock options.

A contentious debate over the application of fair value accounting to troubled financial institutions erupted in 2008 when values of financial securities such as subprime mortgage pools and derivative contracts backed by these pools came into question as trading in these instruments dried up. Without well-functioning markets, estimating (much less observing) market values was, at best, difficult. For example, employees at Credit Suisse were convicted of intentionally overstating the value of thinly traded mortgage bonds to improve the apparent profitability of their trading activities.

Many observers feel that mark-to-market accounting exacerbated the financial meltdown by forcing banks to excessively write down asset values; others feel that a failure to mark would have been tantamount to willfully ignoring reality and abdicating the responsibility to redress problems at nearly or already insolvent banks. The nearby box discusses the debate.

# Quality of Earnings and Accounting Practices

Many firms make accounting choices that will present their financial statements in the best possible light. The different choices available to firms give rise to the comparability problems we have discussed. As a result, earnings statements for different companies may be more or less rosy presentations of true economic earnings—sustainable cash flow that can be paid to shareholders without impairing the firm's productive capacity. Analysts commonly evaluate the quality of earnings reported by a firm. This concept refers to the realism and conservatism of the earnings number, in other words, the extent to which we might expect the reported level of earnings to be sustained.


Examples of the types of factors that influence quality of earnings are:

- Allowance for bad debt. Most firms sell goods using trade credit and must make an allowance for bad debt. An unrealistically low allowance overestimates the payments the firm is likely to receive and therefore reduces the quality of reported earnings.
- Nonrecurring items. Some items that affect earnings should not be expected to recur regularly. These include asset sales, effects of accounting changes, effects of exchange rate movements, or unusual investment income. For example, in years with large stock market returns, some firms enjoy large capital gains on securities held. These contribute to that year's earnings but should not be expected to repeat regularly. Such gains would be considered a "low-quality" component of earnings. Similarly, investment gains in corporate pension plans generate large but one-off contributions to reported earnings.
- Earnings smoothing. In 2003, Freddie Mac was the subject of an accounting scandal when it was revealed that it had improperly reclassified mortgages held in its portfolio in an attempt to reduce its current earnings. Why would it take such actions? Because later, if earnings turned down, Freddie could "release" earnings by reversing these transactions, and thereby create the appearance of steady earnings growth. Indeed, almost until its sudden collapse in 2008, Freddie Mac's nickname on Wall Street was "Steady Freddie." Similarly, in 2021, Bank of America increased its quarterly earnings by about 2.2 billion by releasing reserves it had set aside during the COVID-19 pandemic.[8] This release accounted for nearly one-fourth of that quarter's earnings. There was nothing inappropriate about this action—the bank noted that it was a response to lessened fears of loan defaults as the economic outlook brightened from the depths of the pandemic. Nevertheless, this source of "earnings" is clearly not sustainable over the long term and therefore must be considered low quality.
- Revenue recognition. Under GAAP accounting, a firm is allowed to recognize a sale before it is paid. This is why firms have accounts receivable. But sometimes it can be hard to know when to recognize sales. For example, suppose a computer firm signs a contract to provide products and services over a 5-year period. Should the projected revenue be booked immediately or spread out over five years? A more extreme version of this problem is called "channel stuffing," in which firms "sell" large quantities of goods to customers but give them the right to later either refuse delivery or return the product. The revenue from the "sale" is booked now, but the likely returns are not recognized until they occur (in a future accounting period).

In 2019, Under Armour came under federal investigation for practices that suggested channel stuffing dating back to 2016. Through the latter part of 2016, the company had recorded 26 consecutive quarters of  $20\%$  sales growth. In an apparent attempt to continue that streak, it was accused of pressuring retailers to accept early shipments of its products and of redirecting goods that ordinarily would have been shipped to its own factory stores to discount chains instead so they could be booked as sales in that quarter. By pulling sales forward, the company was able to sustain its impressive growth streak, at least temporarily. But, in fact, those sales appeared to be "borrowed" against future ones, painting an inflated portrait of actual demand for its product and misleading investors about its future prospects. When the federal investigation of its accounting practices became public in November 2019, the share price suffered a 1-day decline of nearly  $19\%$ .


In a similar, but in this case allowable, vein, the online used-car dealer Carvana is able to immediately recognize gains on the loans it extends to its customers by selling those loans to investors rather than keeping them on the books. If the loans were retained, the gains would instead be recognized over time.

If you see accounts receivable increasing faster than sales, or becoming a larger percentage of total assets, beware of these practices. You should also pay attention to rapid growth in firms' reserves for returns, a possible signal of channel stuffing. In fact, Under Armour's reserves for returns increased dramatically in 2016 and 2017. Given the wide latitude firms have in how they recognize revenue, many analysts choose instead to concentrate on cash flow, which is far harder for a company to manipulate.

- Off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities. Suppose that one firm guarantees the outstanding debt of another firm, perhaps a firm in which it has an ownership stake. That obligation ought to be disclosed as a contingent liability because it may require payments down the road. But these obligations may not be reported as part of the firm's outstanding debt. Before its bankruptcy in 2001, Enron became notorious for this practice. Although it had guaranteed the debts of other companies, it failed to recognize these potential liabilities on its balance sheet. To the contrary, it obscured its exposure behind the veil of paper firms—its so-called special-purpose entities (SPEs).

You need to keep your eye on other off-balance sheet items as well. A good example is leasing. Airlines, for example, may show no aircraft on their balance sheets but have long-term leases that are virtually equivalent to debt-financed ownership. However, if the leases are treated as operating rather than capital leases, they may appear only as footnotes to the financial statements.

# International Accounting Conventions

The examples cited above illustrate some of the problems that analysts can encounter when attempting to interpret financial data. Even greater problems arise in the interpretation of the financial statements of foreign firms. This is because these firms do not follow GAAP guidelines. Accounting practices in various countries differ to greater or lesser extents from U.S. standards. Here are some of the major issues that you should be aware of when using the financial statements of foreign firms:

- Reserving practices. Some countries allow firms considerably more discretion in setting aside reserves for future contingencies than is typical in the United States. Because additions to reserves result in a charge against income, reported earnings are subject to managerial discretion.
- Depreciation. In the United States, firms typically maintain separate sets of accounts for tax and reporting purposes. For example, accelerated depreciation is typically used for tax purposes, whereas straight-line depreciation is used for reporting purposes. In contrast, most other countries do not allow dual sets of accounts, and most firms in foreign countries use accelerated depreciation to minimize taxes despite the fact that it results in lower reported earnings. This makes reported earnings of foreign firms lower than they would be if the firms were allowed to use the U.S. practice.
- Intangibles. Treatment of intangibles such as goodwill can vary widely. Are they amortized or expensed? If amortized, over what period? Such issues can have a large impact on reported profits.

The effect of different accounting practices can be substantial. Figure 19.4 compares P/E ratios in different countries as reported and restated on a common basis. While P/E multiples have changed considerably since this study was published, these results illustrate how different accounting rules can have a big impact on these ratios.

Some of the differences between U.S. and European accounting standards arise from different philosophies regarding regulating accounting practice. GAAP accounting in the U.S. is rules-based, with detailed, explicit, and lengthy rules governing almost any circumstance that can be anticipated. In contrast, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) used in the European Union as well as in about 100 other countries such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, India, and China, are principles-based, setting out general approaches for the preparation of financial statements. While IFRS rules are more flexible, firms must be prepared to demonstrate that their accounting choices are consistent with its underlying principles.

For some years, the SEC worked to bring U.S. accounting standards more in line with international rules. In 2007, the SEC began allowing foreign firms to issue securities in the U.S. if their financial statements were prepared using IFRS. Subsequently, it went even further when it proposed allowing large U.S. multinational firms to report earnings using IFRS rather than GAAP and announced that it hoped to eventually adopt IFRS more broadly. But after many years of protracted negotiations, it become clear by 2014 that the SEC's plan to move to IFRS had stalled. While the SEC and the IASB (International Accounting Standards Board) continue to collaborate on accounting rules, there is little immediate prospect for a single global accounting standard that will include the United States.

# 19.7 Value Investing: The Graham Technique

No presentation of fundamental security analysis would be complete without a discussion of the ideas of Benjamin Graham, the greatest of the investment "gurus." Until the evolution of modern portfolio theory in the latter half of the 20th century, Graham was the single most important thinker, writer, and teacher in the field of investment analysis. His influence on investment professionals, among them his now equally famous student Warren Buffet, remains very strong.


Graham's magnum opus is *Security Analysis*, written with Columbia Professor David Dodd in 1934. Its message is similar to the ideas presented in this chapter. Graham believed careful analysis of a firm's financial statements could turn up bargain stocks. Over the years, he developed many different rules for determining the most important financial ratios and the critical values for judging a stock to be undervalued. Through many editions, his book has been so influential and successful that widespread adoption of Graham's techniques has led to the elimination of the very bargains they are designed to identify.

In a 1976 seminar, Graham said:

I am no longer an advocate of elaborate techniques of security analysis in order to find superior value opportunities. This was a rewarding activity, say, forty years ago, when our textbook "Graham and Dodd" was first published; but the situation has changed a good deal since then. In the old days any well-trained security analyst could do a good professional job of selecting undervalued issues through detailed studies; but in the light of the enormous amount of research now being carried on, I doubt whether in most cases such extensive efforts will generate sufficiently superior selections to justify their cost. To that very limited extent I'm on the side of the "efficient market" school of thought now generally accepted by the professors.[9]

Nonetheless, in that same seminar, Graham suggested a simplified approach to identifying bargain stocks:

My first, more limited, technique confines itself to the purchase of common stocks at less than their working-capital value, or net current-asset value, giving no weight to the plant and other fixed assets, and deducting all liabilities in full from the current assets. We used this approach extensively in managing investment funds, and over a 30-odd-year period we must have earned an average of some 20 percent per year from this source. I consider it a foolproof method of systematic investment—once again, not on the basis of individual results but in terms of the expectable group income.

As cited by John Train in Money Masters (New York: Harper & Row, 1987).

1. The primary focus of the security analyst should be the firm's real economic earnings rather than its reported earnings. Accounting earnings as reported in financial statements can be a noisy estimate of economic earnings, although empirical studies reveal that reported earnings convey considerable information concerning a firm's prospects.
2. Firm profitability depends on both the efficiency with which it uses its assets (commonly measured by turnover ratios) as well as the profitability of sales (commonly measured by profit margins). Financing decisions also should be prudent, so analysts also take great interest in leverage ratios and liquidity ratios.
3. ROE is affected by the firm's financial leverage. An increase in the debt-to-equity ratio will raise its ROE if the interest rate on the debt is less than the firm's return on assets.
4. It is often helpful to decompose a firm's ROE ratio into the product of several accounting ratios and to analyze their separate behavior over time or across companies within an industry. A useful breakdown is

$$
\mathrm {R O E} = \frac {\text {N e t p r o f i t s}}{\text {P r e t a x p r o f i t s}} \times \frac {\text {P r e t a x p r o f i t s}}{\text {E B I T}} \times \frac {\text {E B I T}}{\text {S a l e s}} \times \frac {\text {S a l e s}}{\text {A s s e t s}} \times \frac {\text {A s s e t s}}{\text {E q u i t y}}
$$

5. Other accounting ratios that have a bearing on a firm's profitability and/or risk are fixed-asset turnover, inventory turnover, days sales in receivables, and the current, quick, and interest coverage ratios.
6. Two ratios that make use of the market price of the firm's common stock in addition to its financial statements are the ratios of market to book value and price to earnings. Analysts sometimes take low values for these ratios as a sign that the stock is underpriced. However, both ratios may be better interpreted as signals of growth prospects.
7. Good firms are not necessarily good investments. Stock market prices of successful firms may be bid up to levels that reflect that success. If so, the price of these firms relative to their earnings prospects may not constitute a bargain.
8. A major problem in the use of data obtained from a firm's financial statements is comparability. Firms have a great deal of latitude in how they compute various components of revenue and expense. Accounting earnings and financial ratios must be adjusted to a uniform standard before comparing financial results.
9. Comparability problems can be acute when inflation is high. Inflation can create distortions in accounting for inventories, depreciation, and interest expense.
10. Fair value or mark-to-market accounting requires that most assets be valued at current market value rather than historical cost. This policy is controversial because ascertaining true market value in many instances is difficult, and critics contend that financial statements are therefore unduly volatile. Advocates argue that financial statements should reflect the best estimate of current asset values.
11. International financial reporting standards have become progressively accepted throughout the world. They differ from traditional U.S. GAAP procedures in that they are principles-based rather than rules-based.

9. Recently, Galaxy Corporation lowered its allowance for doubtful accounts by reducing bad debt expense from  $2\%$  of sales to  $1\%$  of sales. Ignoring taxes, what are the immediate effects on  $(a)$  operating income and  $(b)$  operating cash flow?

Use the following case in answering Problems 10 through 12: Hatfield Industries is a large manufacturing conglomerate based in the United States with annual sales in excess of 300 million. Hatfield is currently under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for accounting irregularities and possible legal violations in the presentation of the company's financial statements. A due diligence team from the SEC has been sent to Hatfield's corporate headquarters for an audit. The SEC finds that:

- Management has been involved in ongoing negotiations with the local labor union. Labor officials are seeking increased wages and pension benefits, which Hatfield's management states is not possible at this time due to decreased profitability and a tight cash flow situation. Labor officials have accused Hatfield's management of manipulating the company's financial statements to justify not granting any wage concessions.
- Recently obtained equipment has been classified as operating leases, although, in the past, acquisitions of similar equipment were nearly always classified as capital leases. Capital leases for this type of equipment are the industry norm. The SEC wants Hatfield's management to provide justification for this apparent deviation from "normal" accounting practices.
- Inventory on Hatfield's books has been increasing in comparison to sales growth. Management credits the boost in overall production to improved operating efficiencies. The SEC wonders whether Hatfield may have manipulated its inventory accounts.

The SEC due diligence team is not necessarily searching for evidence of fraud but of possible manipulation of accounting standards to mislead shareholders and other interested parties. Initial review of Hatfield's financial statements indicates that, at a minimum, certain practices have resulted in low-quality earnings.

10. Labor officials believe that the management of Hatfield is attempting to understate its net income to avoid making any concessions in the labor negotiations. Which of the following actions by management will most likely result in low-quality earnings?

$a$ . Lengthening the life of a depreciable asset in order to lower the depreciation expense.
$b$ . Lowering the discount rate used to value pension obligations.
c. Recognizing revenue at the time of delivery rather than when payment is received.

11. Hatfield has begun recording all new equipment leases on its books as operating leases, a change from its consistent past use of capital leases, in which the present value of lease payments is recognized as a debt obligation. What is the most likely motivation behind Hatfield's change in accounting methodology? Hatfield is attempting to:

$a$ . Improve its leverage ratios and reduce its perceived leverage.
$b$ . Reduce its cost of goods sold and increase its profitability.
$c$ . Increase its operating margins relative to industry peers.

12. The SEC due diligence team is searching for the reason behind Hatfield's inventory build-up relative to its sales growth. One way to identify a deliberate manipulation of financial results by Hatfield is to search for: a. A decline in inventory turnover.

$b$ . Receivables that are growing faster than sales.
$c$ . A delay in the recognition of expenses.

13. A firm has an ROE of  $3\%$ , a debt-to-equity ratio of .5, and a tax rate of  $21\%$  and pays an interest rate of  $6\%$  on its debt. What is its operating ROA?
14. A firm has a tax burden ratio of .75, a leverage ratio of 1.25, an interest burden of .6, and a return on sales of  $10\%$ . The firm generates 2.40 in sales per dollar of assets. What is the firm's ROE?

4. Janet Ludlow is a recently hired analyst. After describing the electric toothbrush industry, her first report focuses on two companies, QuickBrush Company and SmileWhite Corporation, and concludes:

QuickBrush is a more profitable company than SmileWhite, as indicated by the  $40 \%$ sales growth and substantially higher margins it has produced over the last few years. SmileWhite’s sales and earnings are growing at a  $10 \%$ rate and produce much lower margins. We do not think SmileWhite is capable of growing faster than its recent growth rate of  $10 \%$ , whereas QuickBrush can sustain a  $30 \%$ long- term growth rate.

a. Criticize Ludlow's analysis and conclusion that QuickBrush is more profitable, as defined by return on equity (ROE), than SmileWhite and that it has a higher sustainable growth rate. Use only the information provided in Tables 19B and 19C. Support your criticism by calculating and analyzing:

Table 19C

SmileWhite Corporation financial statements: yearly data (000 except per-share data) b. Explain how QuickBrush has produced an average annual earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of  $40\%$  over the last two years with an ROE that has been declining. Use only the information provided in Table 19B.


Use the following case in answering CFA Problems 5 through 8: Eastover Company (EO) is a large, diversified forest products company. Approximately  $75\%$  of its sales are from paper and forest products, with the remainder from financial services and real estate. The company owns 5.6 million acres of timberland, which is carried at very low historical cost on the balance sheet.

Peggy Mulroney, CFA, is an analyst at the investment counseling firm of Centurion Investments. She is assigned the task of assessing the outlook for Eastover, which is being considered for purchase, and comparing it to another forest products company in Centurion's portfolios, Southampton Corporation (SHC). SHC is a major producer of lumber products in the United States. Building products, primarily lumber and plywood, account for  $89\%$  of SHC's sales, with pulp accounting for the remainder. SHC owns 1.4 million acres of timberland, which is also carried at historical cost on the balance sheet. In SHC's case, however, that cost is not as far below current market as Eastover's.

Mulroney began her examination of Eastover and Southampton by looking at the five components of return on equity (ROE) for each company. For her analysis, Mulroney elected to define equity as total shareholders' equity, including preferred stock. She also elected to use year-end data rather than averages for the balance sheet items.

5. a. On the basis of the data shown in Tables 19D and 19E, calculate each of the five ROE components for Eastover and Southampton in 2023. Using the five components, calculate ROE for both companies.
b. Referring to the components calculated in part (a), explain the difference in ROE for Eastover and Southampton in 2023.
c. Using 2023 data, calculate the sustainable growth rate for both Eastover and Southampton. Discuss the appropriateness of using these calculations as a basis for estimating future growth.

Southampton Corporation ( million, except shares outstanding)

6. a. Mulroney recalled from her CFA studies that the constant-growth discounted dividend model was one way to arrive at a valuation for a company's common stock. She collected current dividend and stock price data for Eastover and Southampton, shown in Table 19F. Using  $11\%$  as the required rate of return (i.e., discount rate) and a projected growth rate of  $8\%$ , compute a constant-growth DDM value for Eastover's stock and compare the computed value for Eastover to its stock price indicated in Table 19G.
b. Mulroney's supervisor commented that a two-stage DDM may be more appropriate for companies such as Eastover and Southampton. Mulroney believes that Eastover and Southampton could grow more rapidly over the next three years (i.e., 2025-2027) and then settle in at a lower but sustainable rate of growth beyond 2027. Her estimates are indicated in Table 19H. Using  $11\%$  as the required rate of return, compute the two-stage DDM value of Eastover's stock and compare that value to its stock price indicated in Table 19G.
c. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of using a constant-growth DDM. Briefly discuss how the two-stage DDM improves upon the constant-growth DDM.

7. In addition to the discounted dividend model approach, Mulroney decided to look at the price-earnings ratio and price-book ratio, relative to the S&P 500, for both Eastover and Southampton. Mulroney elected to perform this analysis using 2020–2024 and current data.

a. Using the data in Tables 19F and 19G, compute both the current and the 5-year (2020-2024) average relative price-earnings ratios and relative price-book ratios for Eastover and Southampton (i.e., ratios relative to those for the S&P 500). Discuss each company's current (2024) relative price-earnings ratio compared to its 5-year average relative price-earnings ratio and each company's current relative price-book ratio as compared to its 5-year average relative price-book ratio.
b. Briefly discuss one disadvantage for each of the relative price-earnings and relative price-book approaches to valuation.

3. GI's ROE in 2023 was  $0.61\%$ , computed as follows:

$$
\mathrm{ROE} = \frac{\mathbb{S}1,042}{.5(\mathbb{S}170,312 + \mathbb{S}171,354)} = .0061,\mathrm{or}.61\%
$$

Its P/E ratio was  $8.50 / \mathbb{S}1.042 = 8.16$  and its P/B ratio was  $\$ 8.50 / 171.354 = .05$ . Its earnings yield (the reciprocal of the P/E ratio) was  $12.25\%$ , compared with an industry average of  $8.3\%$ .

Note that in our calculations P/E does not precisely equal (P/B)/ROE because (following common practice) we have computed ROE with average shareholders' equity in the denominator and P/B with end-of-year shareholders' equity in the denominator.

ROE increased despite a decline in operating margin and a decline in the tax-burden ratio because of increased leverage and turnover. Note that ROA declined from  $11.65\%$  in 2022 to  $10.65\%$  in 2024.

5. LIFO accounting results in lower reported earnings than does FIFO. Fewer assets to depreciate result in lower reported earnings because there is less bias associated with the use of historic cost. More debt results in lower reported earnings because the inflation premium in the interest rate is treated as part of interest expense and not as repayment of principal. If ABC has the same reported earnings as XYZ despite these three sources of downward bias, its real earnings must be greater.

# Options Markets: Introduction

# 20

DERIVATIVE SECURITIES, OR more simply derivatives, play an important role in financial markets. These are securities whose payoffs are determined by, or “derive from,” the prices of other securities.

Options, futures, and swap contracts, which we will discuss in Chapter 23, are all derivatives. Because their values depend on the values of other securities, they can be powerful tools for both hedging and speculation. We will investigate these applications in the next four chapters, starting in this chapter with options.

Trading of standardized options contracts on a national exchange started in 1973 when the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) began listing call options. These contracts were almost immediately a great success. Option contracts are now traded on several exchanges. They are written on common stock, stock indexes, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, precious metals, and interest rates. Popular and potent tools in modifying portfolio characteristics, options have become essential tools a portfolio manager must understand.


This chapter is an introduction to options markets. It explains how puts and calls work and examines their investment characteristics. Popular option strategies are considered next. We then examine a range of securities with embedded options such as callable or convertible bonds. We will see that embedded options are nearly everywhere if you know where to look for them. Finally, we take a quick look at some so-called exotic options.

# 20.1 The Option Contract

A call option gives its holder the right to purchase an asset for a specified price, called the exercise or strike price, on or before some specified expiration date. For example, an October expiration call option on shares of Microsoft with exercise price \$300 entitles its owner to purchase Microsoft for a price of \$300 at any time up to and including the expiration date. The call holder is not required to exercise it. The holder will choose to exercise only if Microsoft's share price exceeds the exercise price. If the share price remains below the exercise price, the option to buy will be left unexercised and becomes valueless.

Figure 20.1 Stock options on Microsoft, September 10, 2021

Source: Yahoo! Finance.

Therefore, if the stock price is greater than the exercise price on the expiration date, the call value equals the difference between the stock price and the exercise price; but if the stock price is less than the exercise price, the call expires worthless. The net profit on the call is the value of the option minus the price originally paid to purchase it.

The purchase price of the option is called the premium. It represents the compensation call buyers pay for the right to exercise only when it is in their interest to do so.

Sellers of call options, who are said to write calls, receive premium income now as payment against the possibility they will be required at some later date to deliver the asset in return for an exercise price less than its market value. If the option is left to expire worthless, the call writer's profit is the premium collected when the option was initially sold. But if the call is exercised, the profit is the premium income minus the difference between the value of the stock that must be delivered and the exercise price paid for those shares. If that difference is larger than the initial premium, the writer incurs a loss.


Figure 20.1 is a small sample of listed stock option quotations for Microsoft on September 10, 2021. The most recent price for the company's stock is  \$295.71. The figure shows prices of options with exercise prices of$ 290, $300, and \$310 and with expiration dates in October and December. We can use the information in this figure to work out the gains or losses on various option positions as a function of the stock price on the expiration date.

# Example 20.1 Profits and Losses on a Call Option

Figure 20.1 shows that the October 1, 2021, expiration call on a share of Microsoft with an exercise price of  \$300 sells on September 10 for\$ 3.60. Until the expiration date, the call holder can exercise the option to buy shares of Microsoft for \$300. Because the stock price on September 10 is only  \$295.71, however, it clearly would not make sense at the moment to exercise the option to buy at\$ 300. Indeed, if Microsoft remains below  \$300 by the expiration date, the call will be left to expire worthless. However, if Microsoft sells above\$ 300 at expiration, the call holder will benefit by exercising. For example, if Microsoft sells for \$302 on October 1, the option holder will exercise the right to pay \$300 for a stock worth \$302. The value of each option on the expiration date would then be

$$
\text {V a l u e} = \text {S t o c k p r i c e - E x e r c i s e p r i c e} = \$ 3 0 2 - \$ 3 0 0 = \$ 2
$$

Despite the  \$2 payoff at expiration, the call holder still realizes a loss of\$ 1.60 on the investment because the initial purchase price was 3.60:

$$
\text {P r o f i t} = \text {F i n a l v a l u e - O r i g i n a l i n v e s t m e n t} = \\ 2. 0 0 - \\ 3. 6 0 = - \\ 1. 6 0
$$

Nevertheless, exercise of the call is optimal at expiration if the stock price exceeds the exercise price because the exercise proceeds will offset at least part of the purchase price. The call buyer will clear a profit if Microsoft is selling above 303.60 at the expiration date. At that stock price, the net proceeds from exercise will just cover the original cost of the call.

A put option gives its holder the right to sell an asset for a specified exercise or strike price on or before some expiration date. An October expiration put on Microsoft with an exercise price of  \$300 entitles its owner to sell Microsoft stock to the put writer for\$ 300 even if the market price of Microsoft is less than that amount. The cost of that put option on September 10 was 7.82. Whereas profits on call options increase when the asset price rises, profits on put options increase when the asset price falls. A put will be exercised only if the price of the underlying asset is less than the exercise price, that is, only if its holder can deliver for the exercise price an asset with a lesser market value. (One doesn't need to own the shares of Microsoft to exercise the put option. Upon exercise, the investor's broker purchases the necessary shares of Microsoft at the market price and immediately delivers, or "puts them," to an option writer for the exercise price.) The owner of the put profits by the difference between the exercise price and market price.

# Example 20.2 Profits and Losses on a Put Option

Now consider the October 1, 2021, expiration put option on Microsoft with an exercise price of \$300, selling on September 10 for \$7.82. It entitles its owner to sell a share of Microsoft for \$300 at any time until October 1. If the put holder buys a share of Microsoft and immediately exercises the right to sell it at \$300, the exercise proceeds will be $300 - $295.71 = \$4.29. Obviously, an investor who pays \$7.82 for the put has no intention of exercising it immediately. If, on the other hand, Microsoft is selling for only 291 at expiration, the put will turn out to be a profitable investment. Its value at expiration will be

Put value at expiration = Exercise price - Stock price =  $300 -$ 291 = \$9 and the investor's profit will be $9 - $7.82 = \$1.18. This is a holding period return of $1.18/$7.82 = .151, or 15.1\%—over only 22 days! Obviously, put sellers on October 1 (who are on the other side of the transaction) do not consider this outcome very likely.


An option is said to be in the money when its exercise would produce a positive cash flow. Therefore, a call option is in the money when the asset price is greater than the exercise price, and a put option is in the money when the asset price is less than the exercise price. Conversely, a call is out of the money when the asset price is less than the exercise price; no one would exercise the right to pay the strike price for a stock when its market value is less than that amount. A put option is out of the money when the exercise price is less than the asset price. Options are at the money when the exercise price and asset price are equal.

# Options Trading

Options contracts traded on exchanges are standardized by allowable expiration dates and exercise prices. Each stock option contract provides for the right to buy or sell 100 shares of stock. Standardization of the terms of listed option contracts means all market participants trade in a limited and uniform set of securities. This increases the depth of trading in any particular option, which lowers trading costs and increases market liquidity.

Most options trading in the United States initially took place on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). However, by 2003 the electronic International Securities Exchange had displaced the CBOE as the largest options market, and virtually all trading today is electronic.

In Figure 20.1, the most recent price for Microsoft, 295.71 per share, is bracketed by available exercise (or strike) prices. If the stock price moves outside the range of exercise prices of listed options, new options with appropriate exercise prices may be offered. Therefore, at any time, both in-the-money and out-of-the-money options will be listed, as in the figure.

When we compare prices of call options with the same expiration date but different exercise prices in Figure 20.1, we see that the value of a call is lower when the exercise price is higher. This makes sense because the right to purchase a share at a lower exercise price is more valuable than the right to purchase at a higher price. Thus, the October 1 expiration call with exercise price \$300 sells for \$3.60, whereas the \$310 exercise price call sells for only \$1.08.

Conversely, put options are worth more when the exercise price is higher: You would rather have the right to sell shares for \$310 than for \$300, and this is reflected in the prices of the puts. The October 1 expiration put with exercise price \$310 sells for \$15.28, whereas the \$300 exercise price put sells for only \$7.82.

Because trading in any particular option can be sporadic, it is not unusual to find option prices that appear out of line with other prices. You might see, for example, two calls with different exercise prices that seem to sell for the same price. This discrepancy arises because the last trades for these options may have occurred at different times during the day. At any moment, the call with the lower exercise price must be worth more than an otherwise-identical call with a higher exercise price.

Expirations of most exchange-traded options tend to be fairly short, ranging up to only several months. For larger firms and several stock indexes, however, longer-term options are traded with expirations ranging up to several years. These options are called LEAPS (for Long-Term Equity AnticiPation Securities).

b. Now answer part (a) for an investor who purchases the December expiration put option with exercise price 300.

# American versus European Options

An American option allows its holder to exercise the right to purchase (if a call) or sell (if a put) the underlying asset on or before the expiration date. European options allow for exercise only on the expiration date. American-style options, because they allow more leeway than their European counterparts, generally will be more valuable. Most traded options in the United States are American style. Foreign currency options and stock index options are notable exceptions to this rule, however.

# Adjustments in Option Contract Terms

Because options convey the right to buy or sell shares at a stated price, stock splits would radically alter their value if the terms of the options contract were not adjusted to account for the split. For example, suppose AppX stock is currently selling at \$150. If the firm announces a 2-for-1 split, its share price will fall to about \$75. A call option with exercise price \$150 would be just about worthless, with virtually no possibility that the stock would sell at more than \$150 before the options expired.


To account for a stock split, the exercise price is reduced by a multiple of the split, and the number of options held is increased by that factor. For example, each original call option with exercise price of  \$150 would be altered after a 2-for-1 split to two new options, with each new option carrying an exercise price of\$ 75. A similar adjustment is made for stock dividends of more than 10\%; the number of shares covered by each option is increased in proportion to the stock dividend, and the exercise price is reduced by that proportion.

In contrast to stock dividends, cash dividends do not affect the terms of an option contract. Because payment of a cash dividend reduces the selling price of the stock without inducing offsetting adjustments in the option contract, the value of the option is affected by dividend policy. Other things being equal, call option values are lower for high-dividend payout policies because such policies slow the rate of increase of stock prices; conversely, put values are higher for high-dividend payouts. (Of course, the option values do not necessarily rise or fall on the dividend payment or ex-dividend dates. Dividend payments are anticipated, so the effect of the payment already is built into the original option price.)

# Concept Check 20.2

Suppose that AppX's stock price at the exercise date is  \$160, and the exercise price of the call is\$ 150. What is the payoff on one option contract? After a 2-for-1 split, the stock price is  \$80, the exercise price is\$ 75, and the option holder now can purchase 200 shares. Show that the split leaves the option investor's payoff unaffected.

# The Options Clearing Corporation

The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), the clearinghouse for options trading, is jointly owned by the exchanges on which stock options are traded. Buyers and sellers of options who agree on a price will strike a deal. At this point, the OCC steps in. The OCC places itself between the two traders, becoming the effective buyer of the option from the writer and the effective writer of the option to the buyer. All individuals, therefore, deal only with the OCC, which effectively guarantees contract performance.

When an option holder exercises an option, the OCC arranges for a member firm with clients who have written that option to make good on the option obligation. The member firm selects from its clients who have written that option to fulfill the contract. The selected client must deliver 100 shares of stock in return for the exercise price for each call option contract written or must purchase 100 shares at the exercise price for each put contract written.

Because the OCC guarantees contract performance, it requires option writers to post margin to guarantee that they in turn can fulfill their obligations. The margin required is determined in part by the amount by which the option is in the money because "mon-eyness" indicates the potential obligation of the option writer. Out-of-the-money options require less margin from the writer, for expected payouts are lower. When the required margin exceeds the posted margin, the writer will receive a margin call. In contrast, the holder of the option need not post margin because the holder will exercise only if it is advantageous to do so. Once the option is purchased, no further money is at risk.


Margin requirements are determined in part by the other securities held in the investor's portfolio. For example, a call writer owning the stock against which the option is written can satisfy the margin requirement simply by allowing a broker to hold that stock in the brokerage account. The stock is then guaranteed to be available for delivery should the call be exercised.

# Other Listed Options

Options on assets other than stocks are also widely traded. These include options on market indexes and industry indexes, on foreign currency, and even on the futures prices of agricultural products, gold, silver, fixed-income securities, and stock indexes.

Index Options An index option is a call or put on a stock market index such as the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ 100. Index options are traded on several broad-based indexes as well as on several industry-specific indexes and even commodity price indexes. We discussed many of these indexes in Chapter 2.

Option contracts on many foreign stock indexes also trade. For example, options on the (Japanese) Nikkei Stock Index trade on the Singapore as well as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Options on European indexes such as the Financial Times Share Exchange (FTSE 100) trade on the NYSE-Euronext Exchange. The Chicago Board Options Exchange also lists options on industry indexes such as the oil or high-tech industries.

In contrast to stock options, index options do not require that the call writer actually "deliver the index" upon exercise or that the put writer "purchase the index." Instead, a cash settlement procedure is used. The payoff that would accrue upon exercise of the option is calculated, and the option writer simply pays that amount to the option holder. The payoff is equal to the difference between the exercise price and the value of the index. For example, if the S&P index is at 4,000 when a call option on the index with exercise price 3,990 is exercised, the holder of the call receives a cash payment of the difference, 4,000 - 3,990, times the contract multiplier of \$100, or \$1,000 per contract.

Options on the S&P 100 (often called the OEX after its ticker symbol), the S&P 500 (the SPX), the NASDAQ 100 (the NDX), and the Dow Jones Industrials (the DJX) are the most actively traded contracts on the CBOE. Together, these contracts dominate CBOE volume.

Futures Options Futures options give their holders the right to buy or sell a specified futures contract, using as a futures price the exercise price of the option. Although the delivery process is slightly complicated, the terms of futures options contracts are designed in effect to allow the option to be written on the futures price itself. The option holder receives upon exercise the difference between the current futures price and the exercise price of the option. Thus, if the futures price is, say,  \$37, and the call has an exercise price of\$ 35, the holder who exercises the call option on the futures gets a payoff of 2 times the contract multiplier.

Foreign Currency Options A currency option offers the right to buy or sell a specified quantity of foreign currency for a specified number of U.S. dollars. Currency option contracts call for purchase or sale of the currency in exchange for a specified number of U.S. dollars. Contracts are quoted in cents or fractions of a cent per unit of foreign currency.

There is an important difference between currency options and currency futures options. The former provide payoffs that depend on the difference between the exercise price and the exchange rate at expiration. The latter provide payoffs that depend on the difference between the exercise price and the exchange rate futures price. Because exchange rates and exchange rate futures prices generally are not equal, the options and futures-options contracts will have different values, even with identical expiration dates and exercise prices. Trading volume in currency futures options dominates trading in currency options.

Interest Rate Options Options are traded on Treasury notes and bonds of various maturities, Treasury bills, and government bonds of other major economies such as the U.K. or Japan. Options on several interest rates also trade. Among these are contracts on Eurodollar, federal funds, and SOFR futures.

# 20.2 Values of Options at Expiration

# Call Options

Recall that a call option gives the right to purchase a security at the exercise price. Suppose you hold a call option on FinCorp stock with an exercise price of  \$100, and FinCorp is selling at\$ 110 on the option's expiration date. You can exercise your option to purchase the stock at \$100 and simultaneously sell the shares at the market price of \$110, clearing \$10 per share. Yet if the shares are selling below \$100, you can let the call expire, realizing no further gain or loss. The value of the call at expiration therefore equals

$$
\text {P a y o f t} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} S _ {T} - X & \text {i f} S _ {T} > X \\ 0 & \text {i f} S _ {T} \leq X \end{array} \right.
$$ where  $S_{T}$  is the value of the stock at expiration and  $X$  is the exercise price. This formula emphasizes the option property because the payoff cannot be negative. The call is exercised only if  $S_{T}$  exceeds  $X$ . If  $S_{T}$  is less than  $X$ , the option expires with zero value. The loss to the option holder in this case equals the price originally paid to acquire the option. More generally, the profit to the option holder is the option payoff at expiration minus the original purchase price.


The value at expiration of the call with exercise price  $\$ 100$  is given by the schedule:

<table><tr><td>Stock price</td><td>$90</td><td>$100</td><td>$110</td><td>$120</td><td>130</td></tr><tr><td>Option value</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>20</td><td>30</td></tr></table>

For stock prices at or below  \$100, the option is worthless. Above\$ 100, the option is worth the excess of the stock price over \$100. The option's value increases by \$1 for each dollar increase in the stock price. This relationship is depicted in Figure 20.2.

The solid line is the value of the call at expiration. The net profit equals the expiration value of the call less its initial price. Suppose the call cost  \$14. Then the profit to the call holder would be given by the dashed (bottom) line of Figure 20.2. At option expiration, if the stock price is less than or equal to\$ 100, the investor's loss is 14.

Profits do not become positive until the stock price at expiration exceeds \$114. At that price, the payoff to the call, $T - X = $114 - \$100 = 14, equals the initial cost of the call.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/5809a2a926234bf32ac57dfed149076ddad855ce929bb562e6a9d23b0b60b57c.jpg)
Figure 20.2 Payoff and profit to call option at expiration

Conversely, the call writer loses if the stock price is sufficiently high. In that scenario, the writer will be obligated to deliver a stock worth  $S_{T}$  for only  $X$  dollars:

$$
\text {P a y o f f t o c a l l w r i t e r} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} - (S _ {T} - X) & \text {i f} S _ {T} > X \\ 0 & \text {i f} S _ {T} \leq X \end{array} \right.
$$

The call writer is willing to bear this risk in return for the option premium.

Figure 20.3 shows the payoff and profit diagrams for the call writer. These are the mirror images of the corresponding diagrams for the call holder. The break-even point for the option writer also is 114. The (negative) payoff at that point just offsets the premium originally received when the option was written.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/378812d262b73bdb9ffc6a6377611e9275fa1d08240bf04f912e8cb12ff49cd8.jpg)
Figure 20.3 Payoff and profit to call writer at expiration

# Put Options

A put option is the right to sell an asset at the exercise price. The put holder will not exercise unless the asset is worth less than the exercise price. For example, if FinCorp shares fall to \$90, a put option with exercise price \$100 can be exercised to clear \$10 for its holder. The holder would purchase a share for \$90 and simultaneously deliver it to the put writer for the exercise price of 100.

The value of a put option at expiration is

$$
\text {P a y o f f t o p u t h o l d e r} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 0 & \text {i f} S _ {T} \geq X \\ X - S _ {T} & \text {i f} S _ {T} <   X \end{array} \right.
$$

The solid line in Figure 20.4 plots the payoff at expiration on a FinCorp put with an exercise price of  \$100. If the stock price at expiration is above\$ 100, the put has no value, as the right to sell the shares at \$100 would not be exercised. Below a price of \$100, the put value at expiration increases by 1 for each dollar the stock price falls. The dashed line plots the put option owner's profit at expiration, net of the initial cost of the put.


Writing puts naked (i.e., writing a put without an offsetting short position in the stock) exposes the writer to losses if the market falls. Writing naked, deep-out-of-the-money puts was once considered an attractive way to generate income: As long as the market did not fall sharply before option expiration, the option premium could be collected without the put holder ever exercising the option against the writer. Because the put would remain out of the money unless the market fell sharply, the strategy was not viewed as overly risky. However, in the market crash of October 1987 when the S&P 500 fell by  $20\%$  in one day, such put writers suffered huge losses. Participants now perceive much greater risk to this strategy.

# Concept Check 20.3

Consider these four option strategies: (i) buy a call; (ii) write a call; (iii) buy a put; (iv) write a put.

a. For each strategy, plot both the payoff and profit diagrams as a function of the final stock price.
b. Why might one characterize both buying calls and writing puts as “bullish” strategies? What is the difference between them?
c. Why might one characterize both buying puts and writing calls as “bearish” strategies? What is the difference between them?

# Option versus Stock Investments

Purchasing call options is a bullish strategy; that is, the calls provide profits when stock prices increase. Purchasing puts, in contrast, is a bearish strategy. Symmetrically, writing calls is bearish, whereas writing puts is bullish. Because option values depend on the price of the underlying stock, purchase of options may be viewed as a substitute for direct purchase or sale of a stock. Why might an option strategy be preferable to direct stock transactions?

For example, why would you purchase a call option rather than buy shares of stock directly? Maybe you believe the stock will increase in value from its current level, which in our examples we will take to be \$100. You know you could be incorrect, however, and the share price could fall. Suppose a 1-year maturity call option with exercise price \$100 currently sells for \$10, and the interest rate is 3\%. Consider these three strategies for investing a sum of money, say, \$10,000. For simplicity, suppose the firm will not pay any dividends during the year.

Strategy A: Invest entirely in stock. Buy 100 shares, each selling for 100.

Strategy B: Invest entirely in at-the-money call options. Buy 1,000 calls, each selling for 10. (This would require 10 contracts, each for 100 shares.)

Strategy C: Purchase 100 call options for  \$1,000. Invest your remaining\$ 9,000 in 1-year T-bills, to earn 3\% interest. The bills will grow in value from  $9,000 to$ 9,000 × 1.03 = 9,270.

Let's trace the possible values of these three portfolios as a function of the stock price when the options expire at the end of the year.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Portfolio</td><td colspan="6">Stock Price</td></tr><tr><td>$95</td><td>$100</td><td>$105</td><td>$110</td><td>$115</td><td>$120</td></tr><tr><td>Portfolio A: All stock</td><td>$9,500</td><td>$10,000</td><td>$10,500</td><td>$11,000</td><td>$11,500</td><td>$12,000</td></tr><tr><td>Portfolio B: All options</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5,000</td><td>10,000</td><td>15,000</td><td>20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Portfolio C: Call plus T-bills</td><td>9,270</td><td>9,270</td><td>9,770</td><td>10,270</td><td>10,770</td><td>11,270</td></tr></table>

Portfolio  $A$  is worth 100 times the share price. Portfolio  $B$  is worthless unless shares sell for more than the exercise price of the call. Beyond that point, the portfolio is worth 1,000 times the excess of the stock price over the exercise price. Finally, portfolio  $C$  is worth \$9,270 from the investment in T-bills plus the value of the 100 call options. Remember that each of these portfolios involves the same \$ 10,000 initial investment. The rates of return on these three portfolios are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Portfolio</td><td colspan="6">Stock Price</td></tr><tr><td>$95</td><td>$100</td><td>$105</td><td>$110</td><td>$115</td><td>$120</td></tr><tr><td>Portfolio A: All stock</td><td>-5.0\%</td><td>0.0\%</td><td>5.0\%</td><td>10.0\%</td><td>15.0\%</td><td>20.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>Portfolio B: All options</td><td>-100.0</td><td>-100.0</td><td>-50.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>50.0</td><td>100.0</td></tr><tr><td>Portfolio C: Call plus T-bills</td><td>-7.3</td><td>-7.3</td><td>-2.3</td><td>2.7</td><td>7.7</td><td>12.7</td></tr></table>

These rates of return are graphed in Figure 20.5.

Comparing the returns of portfolios  $B$  and  $C$  to those of the stock investment represented by portfolio  $A$ , we see that options offer two interesting features. First, an option offers leverage. Compare portfolios  $B$  and  $A$ . Unless the stock increases from its initial value of \$100, the value of portfolio  $B$  falls precipitously to zero—a rate of return of negative  $100\%$ . Conversely, modest increases in the rate of return on the stock result in disproportionate increases in the option rate of return. For example, a  $4.3\%$  increase in the stock price from $115 to $120 would increase the rate of return on the call from  $50\%$  to  $100\%$ . In this sense, calls are a levered investment on the stock. Their values respond more than proportionately to changes in the stock price.

Figure 20.5 vividly illustrates this point. The slope of the all-option portfolio is far steeper than that of the all-stock portfolio, reflecting its greater proportional sensitivity to the value of the underlying security. This is the reason investors (illegally) exploiting inside information commonly choose options as their investment vehicle.

The potential insurance value of options is the second interesting feature, as portfolio  C  shows. The T-bill-plus-option portfolio cannot be worth less than  \9,270  at the end of the year, as the option can always be left to expire worthless. The worst possible rate of return on portfolio  C  is  -7.3\% , compared to a (theoretically) worst possible rate of return on the stock of  $-100\%$ . Of course, this insurance comes at a price: When the share price rises, portfolio  $C$  underperforms portfolio  $A$ , the all-stock portfolio, by about 9.33 percentage points.


This simple example makes an important point. Although options can be used by speculators as effectively leveraged stock positions, as in portfolio  $B$ , they also can be used by investors who desire to tailor their risk exposures in creative ways, as in portfolio  $C$ . For example, the call-plus-bills strategy of portfolio  $C$  provides a rate of return profile quite unlike that of the stock alone. The limitation on downside risk is a novel and attractive feature of this strategy. We next discuss several option strategies that provide other risk profiles that might be attractive to hedgers and other investors.

# 20.3 Option Strategies

An unlimited variety of payoff patterns can be achieved by combining puts and calls with various exercise prices. We explain in this section the motivation and structure of some of the more popular strategies.

# Protective Put

Imagine you would like to invest in a stock, but you are unwilling to bear potential losses beyond some given level. Investing in the stock alone seems risky to you because in principle you could lose all the money you invest. You might consider adding a "protective" put option on the stock to your portfolio. Table 20.1 shows the total value of your portfolio at option expiration: Whatever happens to the stock price, you are guaranteed a payoff at least equal to the put option's exercise price because the put gives you the right to sell your shares for that amount.

# Example 20.3 Protective Put

Suppose the strike price is  $X = \$ 100 $and the stock is selling at$ \ $97\$  at option expiration. Then the value of your total portfolio is \$100. The stock is worth  $\$97$  and the value of the expiring put option is

$$
X - S _ {T} = \$ 100 - \$ 97 = \$ 3
$$

Another way to look at it is that you are holding the stock and a put option giving you the right to sell your share for  \$100. The right to sell locks in a minimum portfolio value of\$ 100. On the other hand, if the stock price is above  $100, say,$ 104, then the right to sell a share at \$100 is worthless. You allow the put to expire unexercised, ending up with a share of stock worth S_T = \$104.

# Table 20.1

Value of a protective put portfolio at option expiration

<table><tr><td></td><td>ST≤X</td><td>ST&gt; X</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>ST</td><td>ST</td></tr><tr><td>+Put</td><td>X - ST</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>X</td><td>ST</td></tr></table>

Figure 20.6 illustrates the payoff and profit to this protective put strategy. The solid line in Figure 20.6, Panel C, is the total payoff. The dashed line is displaced downward by the cost of establishing the position,  $S_0 + P$ . Notice that potential losses are limited.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/919eed52a048440cf37b6166104b381f855c9ec7b570a4d26a5d0549b0901fcb.jpg)
Figure 20.6 Value of a protective put position at option expiration

It is instructive to compare the profit on the protective put strategy with that of the stock investment. For simplicity, consider an at-the-money put, so that  $X = S_{0}$ . Figure 20.7 compares the profits for the two strategies. The profit on the stock is zero if the stock price remains unchanged and  $S_{T} = S_{0}$ . It rises or falls by \$1 for every dollar swing in the ultimate stock price. The profit on the protective put strategy is negative and equal to the cost of the put if  $S_{T}$  is below  $S_{0}$ . But its profit increases one for one with increases in the stock price once  $S_{T}$  exceeds  $S_{0}$ .

Figure 20.7 makes it clear that the protective put offers insurance against stock price declines in that it limits losses. Therefore, protective put strategies provide a form of portfolio insurance. The cost of the protection is that if the stock price increases, your profit is reduced by the amount you expended on the put, which turned out to be unneeded.

Figure 20.7 Protective put versus stock investment (at-the-money option)

This example also shows that despite the common perception that derivatives mean risk, derivative securities can be used effectively for risk management. In fact, such risk management is widely viewed as part of the fiduciary responsibility of financial managers. In one often-cited court case, *Brane v. Roth*, a company's board of directors was successfully sued for failing to use derivatives to hedge the price risk of grain held in storage. Such hedging might have been accomplished using protective puts.


The claim that derivatives are best viewed as risk management tools may seem surprising in light of the financial crisis of 2007-2009. The crisis was immediately precipitated when the positions that many financial institutions had established in credit derivatives blew up, resulting in large losses and government bailouts. Still, the same characteristics that make derivatives potent tools to increase risk also make them highly effective in managing risk, at least when used properly. Derivatives have aptly been compared to power tools: very useful in skilled hands, but also dangerous when not handled with care.

# Covered Calls

A covered call position is the purchase of a share of stock coupled with a sale of a call option on that stock. The written call is "covered" because the potential obligation to deliver the stock can be satisfied using the stock held in the portfolio. Writing an option without an offsetting stock position is called by contrast naked option writing. The payoff to a covered call, presented in Table 20.2, equals the stock value minus the value of the written call.

The solid line in Figure 20.8, Panel C, is the payoff. You see that the position is worth  $S_{T}$  when the stock price at time  $T$  is below  $X$  and rises to a maximum of  $X$  when  $S_{T}$  exceeds  $X$ . In essence, the sale of the call options means the call writer has

Figure 20.8 Value of a covered call position at expiration


Writing covered call options has been a popular investment strategy among institutional investors. Consider the managers of a fund invested largely in stocks. They might find it appealing to write calls on some or all of the stock in order to boost income by the premiums collected. Although they thereby forfeit potential capital gains should the stock price rise above the exercise price, if they view  $X$  as the price at which they plan to sell the stock anyway, then they may rationalize the call as providing a kind of "sell discipline." The written call guarantees the stock sale will occur as planned.

# Example 20.4 Covered Call

Assume a pension fund holds 1,000 shares of stock, with a current price of \$100 per share. Suppose the portfolio manager intends to sell all 1,000 shares if the share price hits \$110, and a call expiring in 60 days with an exercise price of \$110 currently sells for \$5. By writing 10 call contracts (for 100 shares each), the fund can pick up \$5,000 in extra income. The fund would lose its share of profits from any movement of the stock price above \$110 per share, but if it would have sold its shares at 110, it would not have realized those profits anyway.

# Straddle

A long straddle is established by buying both a call and a put, each with the same exercise price,  $X$ , and the same expiration date,  $T$ . Straddles are useful strategies for investors who believe a stock price will move a lot but are uncertain about the direction of the move. For example, suppose you believe an important court case that will make or break a company is about to be settled, and the market is not yet aware of the situation. The stock price will either double in value if the case is settled favorably or drop by half if the settlement goes against the company. The straddle will do well regardless of the outcome because its value rises when the stock price makes either extreme upward or downward moves from  $X$ .

The worst-case scenario for a straddle is no movement in the stock price. If  $S_{T}$  equals  $X$ , both the call and the put expire worthless, and the investor's outlay for the purchase of both options is lost. Straddles, therefore, are bets on volatility. The straddle investor must view the stock as more volatile than the market does.

The payoff to a straddle is presented in Table 20.3. The solid line in Figure 20.9, Panel C, illustrates this payoff. Notice the portfolio payoff is always positive, except at the one point where the portfolio has zero value,  $S_{T} = X$ . You might wonder why all investors don't pursue such a seemingly "no-lose" strategy. The reason is that the straddle requires that both the put and call be purchased. The value of the portfolio at expiration, while never negative, still must exceed the initial outlay for a straddle to clear a profit.

The dashed line in Figure 20.9, Panel C, is the profit diagram, which lies below the payoff line by the initial cost of the straddle,  $P + C$ . The final stock price must depart from  $X$  by this amount for the straddle to provide a profit.

# Spreads

A spread is a combination of two or more call options (or two or more puts) on the same stock with differing exercise prices or times to maturity. Some options are bought, whereas others are sold, or written. A money spread involves the purchase of one option and the simultaneous sale of another with a different exercise price. A time spread refers to the sale and purchase of options with differing expiration dates.

Consider a money spread in which one call option is bought at an exercise price  $X_{1}$ , whereas another call with an identical expiration date, but higher exercise price,  $X_{2}$ , is written. The payoff will be the difference in the value of the call held and the value of the call written, as in Table 20.4.

There are now three instead of two outcomes to distinguish: the lowest-price region where  $S_{T}$  is below both exercise prices, a middle region where  $S_{T}$  is between the two exercise prices, and a high-price region where  $S_{T}$  exceeds both exercise prices. Figure 20.10 illustrates the payoff and profit to this strategy, which is called a bullish spread because the payoff either increases or is unaffected by stock price increases.

One motivation for a bullish spread might be that the investor thinks one option is overpriced relative to another. For example, an investor who believes an X = \100 call is cheap compared to an X = \$110 call might establish the spread, even without a strong desire to take a bullish position in the stock.

# Collars

A collar is an options strategy that brackets the value of a portfolio between two bounds. Suppose that an investor currently is holding a large position in FinCorp stock, which is currently selling at \$100 per share. A lower bound of \$90 can be placed on the value of the portfolio by buying a protective put with exercise price \$90. This protection, however, requires that the investor pay the put premium. To raise the money to pay for the put, the investor might write a call option, say, with exercise price \$110. The call might sell for roughly the same price as the put, meaning that the net outlay for the two options positions is approximately zero. Writing the call limits the portfolio's upside potential. Even if the stock price moves above \$110, the investor will do no better than \$110 because at a higher price the stock will be called away. Thus, the investor obtains the downside protection represented by the exercise price of the put by selling a claim to any upside potential beyond the exercise price of the call.

# Example 20.5 Collars

A collar would be appropriate for an investor who has a target wealth goal in mind but is unwilling to risk losses beyond a certain level. If you are contemplating buying a house for \$220,000, for example, you might set this figure as your goal. Your current wealth may be \$200,000, and you are unwilling to risk losing more than \$20,000. A collar established by (1) purchasing 2,000 shares of stock currently selling at \$100 per share, (2) purchasing 2,000 put options (20 options contracts) with exercise price \$90, and (3) writing 2,000 calls with exercise price \$110 would give you a chance to realize the \$20,000 capital gain without risking a loss of more than \$20,000.

# 20.4 The Put-Call Parity Relationship

We saw in the previous section that a protective put portfolio, comprising a stock position and a put option on that position, provides a payoff with a guaranteed minimum value, but with unlimited upside potential. This is not the only way to achieve such protection, however. A call-plus-bills portfolio also can limit downside risk while offering the same upside potential.

Consider buying a call option and, in addition, buying Treasury bills with face value equal to the exercise price of the call, and maturity date equal to the expiration date of the option. For example, if the exercise price of the call is  \$100, then each option contract (which is written on 100 shares) would require payment of\$ 10,000 upon exercise. Therefore, you would purchase a T-bill with a maturity value of 10,000. More generally, for each option that you hold with exercise price X, you would purchase a risk-free zero-coupon bond with face value X.

Examine the value of this position at time  $T$ , when the options expire and the zero-coupon bond matures:

<table><tr><td></td><td>ST≤X</td><td>ST&gt; X</td></tr><tr><td>Value of call option</td><td>0</td><td>ST-X</td></tr><tr><td>Value of zero-coupon bond</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>X</td><td>ST</td></tr></table>

If the stock price is below the exercise price, the call is worthless, but the bond matures to its face value,  $X$ . It therefore provides a floor value to the portfolio. If the stock price exceeds  $X$ , then the payoff to the call,  $S_{T} - X$ , is added to the face value of the bond to provide a total payoff of  $S_{T}$ . The payoff to this portfolio is precisely identical to the payoff of the protective put that we derived in Table 20.1.

If two portfolios always provide equal values, then they must cost the same amount to establish. Therefore, the call-plus-bond portfolio must cost the same as the stock-plus-put portfolio. Each call currently (at time 0) costs  $C_0$ . The riskless zero-coupon bond costs  $X / (1 + r_f)^T$ . Therefore, the call-plus-bond portfolio costs  $C_0 + X / (1 + r_f)^T$ . The stock costs  $S_0$  to purchase now (at time zero), while the put costs  $P_0$ . Therefore, we conclude that

$$
C _ {0} + \frac {X}{\left(1 + r _ {f}\right) ^ {T}} = S _ {0} + P _ {0} \tag {20.1}
$$

Equation 20.1 is called the put-call parity theorem because it represents the proper relationship between put and call prices. If the parity relation is ever violated, an arbitrage opportunity arises. For example, suppose you collect these data for a certain stock:

<table><tr><td>Stock price</td><td>\$110</td></tr><tr><td>Call price (1-year expiration, X = $105)</td><td>$ 17</td></tr><tr><td>Put price (1-year expiration, X = \$105)</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Risk-free interest rate</td><td>5\% per year</td></tr></table>

We can use these data in Equation 20.1 to see if parity is violated:

$$
\begin{array}{l} C _ {0} + \frac {X}{\left(1 + r _ {f}\right) ^ {T}} \stackrel {?} {=} S _ {0} + P _ {0} \\ 1 7 + \frac {1 0 5}{1 . 0 5} \stackrel {?} {=} 1 1 0 + 5 \\ 1 1 7 \neq 1 1 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

This result, a violation of parity—117 does not equal 115—indicates mispricing. To exploit the mispricing, you buy the relatively cheap portfolio (the stock-plus-put position represented on the right-hand side of the equation) and sell the relatively expensive portfolio (the call-plus-bond position corresponding to the left-hand side). Therefore, if you buy the stock, buy the put, write the call, and borrow 100 for one year (because borrowing money is the opposite of buying a bond), you should earn arbitrage profits.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Position</td><td rowspan="2">Immediate Cash Flow</td><td colspan="2">Cash Flow in 1 Year</td></tr><tr><td>ST&lt; 105</td><td>ST≥ 105</td></tr><tr><td>Buy stock</td><td>-110</td><td>ST</td><td>ST</td></tr><tr><td>Borrow $105/1.05 = $100</td><td>+100</td><td>-105</td><td>-105</td></tr><tr><td>Write call</td><td>+17</td><td>0</td><td>-(ST-105)</td></tr><tr><td>Buy put</td><td>-5</td><td>105 - ST</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

# Table 20.5

Arbitrage strategy

Let's examine the payoff to this strategy. In one year, the stock will be worth $T. The \$100 borrowed will be paid back with interest, resulting in a cash outflow of \$105. The written call will result in a cash outflow of $T - $105 if $T exceeds \$105. The purchased put pays off $105 - $T if the stock price is below \$105.

Table 20.5 summarizes the outcome. The immediate cash inflow is  \$2, exactly the amount by which parity is violated. In one year, the various positions provide exactly offsetting cash flows: The\$ 2 inflow is realized without any offsetting outflows. This is an arbitrage opportunity that investors will pursue on a large scale until buying and selling pressure restores the parity condition expressed in Equation 20.1.

Equation 20.1 actually applies only to options on stocks that pay no dividends before the expiration date of the option. The extension of the parity condition for European call options on dividend-paying stocks is, however, straightforward. Problem 12 at the end of the chapter leads you through the demonstration. The more general formulation of the put-call parity condition is

$$
P _ {0} = C _ {0} - S _ {0} + \operatorname {P V} (X) + \operatorname {P V} (\text {d i v i d e n d s}) \tag {20.2}
$$ where PV(dividends) is the present value of the dividends that will be paid by the stock during the life of the option. If the stock does not pay dividends, Equation 20.2 becomes identical to Equation 20.1.


Notice that this generalization would apply as well to European options on assets other than stocks. Instead of using dividend income in Equation 20.2, we would let any income paid out by the underlying asset play the role of the stock dividends. For example, European put and call options on bonds would satisfy the same parity relationship, except that the bond's coupon income would replace the stock's dividend payments in the parity formula.

Even this generalization, however, applies only to European options, as the cash flow streams from the two portfolios represented by the two sides of Equation 20.2 will match only if each position is held until expiration. If a call and a put may be optimally exercised at different times before their common expiration date, then the equality of payoffs cannot be assured, or even expected, and the portfolios will have different values.

# Example 20.6 Put-Call Parity

Let's see how well parity works using the data in Figure 20.1 on the Microsoft options. The December 17 expiration call with exercise price \$300 and time to expiration of 98 days cost \$11.75 while the corresponding put option cost \$16.25. Microsoft was selling for \$295.71, and the annualized short-term interest rate on this date was about 0.3\%. Microsoft was expected to pay its next dividend of $.62 on December 9, 90 days from the date of these listings. According to parity, we should find that

$$
\begin{array}{l} P _ {0} = C _ {0} + \mathrm {P V} (X) - S _ {0} + \mathrm {P V} (\text {d i v i d e n d s}) \\ 1 6. 2 5 = 1 1. 7 5 + \frac {3 0 0}{(1 . 0 0 3) ^ {9 8 / 3 6 5}} - 2 9 5. 7 1 + \frac {. 6 2}{(1 . 0 0 3) ^ {9 0 / 3 6 5}} \\ 1 6. 2 5 = 1 1. 7 5 + 2 9 9. 7 5 8 8 - 2 9 5. 7 1 +. 6 1 9 5 \\ 1 6. 2 5 = 1 6. 4 1 8 \\ \end{array}
$$

So parity appears to be violated by $.168 per share.

Is this a big enough difference to exploit? Almost certainly not. You have to weigh the potential profit against the trading costs of the call, put, and stock. For example, the bid-ask spreads on both the call and put options were reported at 40. This spread would more than wipe out the apparent arbitrage opportunity.^2 In addition, given the fact that options trade relatively infrequently, this deviation from parity might not be "real," but may instead be attributable to "stale" (i.e., out-of-date) price quotes at which you cannot actually trade.

# 20.5 Option-like Securities

Even if you never intend to trade an option directly, you would still need to appreciate their properties. This is because many financial instruments and agreements have features that convey implicit or explicit options to one or more parties. To value and use these securities, you must understand their embedded option attributes.

# Callable Bonds

You know from Chapter 14 that many corporate bonds are issued with call provisions entitling the issuer to buy bonds back from bondholders at a specified call price. The bond issuer thus holds an implicit call option with exercise price equal to the price at which the bond can be repurchased. A callable bond therefore is essentially a straight bond (a bond with no option features such as callability or convertibility) bundled with a call option retained by the bond-issuing firm.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/5597b38638b6531856c0a5da92bcfd94d49a3fa46ce68f97d3e14fd3d44a4b92.jpg)
Figure 20.11 Values of callable bonds compared with straight bonds


There must be some compensation for the firm's implicit call option. If the callable bond were issued with the same coupon rate as a straight bond, it would sell at a lower price: The price difference would equal the value of the call. To sell callable bonds at par, firms must offer coupon rates higher than the coupons on straight debt.

Figure 20.11 illustrates this optionlike property. The horizontal axis is the value of a straight bond with otherwise identical terms to the callable bond. The dashed 45-degree line represents the value of straight debt. The solid line is the value of the callable bond, and the dotted line is the value of the call option retained by the firm. A callable bond's potential for capital gains is limited by the firm's option to repurchase at the call price.


![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/d1a843241713e8dacc521df2abe40b50693e1099f024e19e6e1df7b8ef2427f7.jpg)

# Concept Check 20.6

How is a callable bond similar to a covered call position on a straight bond?

The option inherent in callable bonds typically is more complex than an ordinary call option. First, it usually may be exercised only after some initial period of call protection. In addition, the price at which the bond is callable may change over time. Unlike exchange-listed options, these features are defined in the initial bond covenant and will depend on the needs of the issuing firm and its perception of the market's tastes.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/2a81618f85349ac15848e058513ba3135649c5d30fa4ffca7c77600d3db64142.jpg)

# Concept Check 20.7

Suppose the period of call protection is extended. How will the coupon rate the company needs to offer on its bonds change to enable the issuer to still sell the bonds at par value?

# Convertible Securities

Convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock convey options to the holder of the security rather than to the issuing firm. A convertible security typically gives its holder the right to exchange each bond or share of preferred stock for a fixed number of shares of common stock, regardless of the market prices of the securities at the time.

For example, a bond with a conversion ratio of 10 allows its holder to convert one bond of par value  \$1,000 into 10 shares of common stock. Alternatively, we say the conversion price in this case is\$ 100: To receive 10 shares of stock, the investor hands over bonds with face value \$1,000 or, put another way, \$100 of face value per share. If the present value of the bond's scheduled payments is less than 10 times the stock price, it may pay to convert; that is, the conversion option is in the money. A bond worth \$950 with a conversion ratio of 10 could be converted profitably if the stock were selling above \$95, as the value of the 10 shares received for each bond surrendered would exceed 950. Most convertible bonds are issued "deep out of the money." That is, the issuer sets the conversion ratio so that conversion will not be profitable unless there is a substantial increase in stock prices and/or decrease in bond prices from the time of issue.

A bond's conversion value equals the value it would have if you converted it into stock immediately. Clearly, a bond must sell for at least its conversion value. If it did not, you could purchase the bond, convert it, and clear an immediate profit. This arbitrage opportunity could never persist, for all investors would pursue such a strategy and quickly bid up the price of the bond.

The straight bond value, or "bond floor," is the value the bond would have if it were not convertible into stock. The bond must sell for more than its straight bond value because a convertible bond has more value; it is in fact a straight bond plus a valuable call option. Therefore, the convertible bond has two lower bounds on its market price: the conversion value and the straight bond value.

Should a convertible bond issued at par value have a higher or lower coupon rate than a nonconvertible bond issued at par?

Figure 20.12 illustrates the optionlike properties of the convertible bond. Figure 20.12, Panel A, shows the value of the straight debt as a function of the stock price of the issuing firm. For healthy firms, the straight debt value is almost independent of the value of

Convertible Bond Value the stock because default risk is small. However, if the firm is close to bankruptcy (stock prices are very low), default risk increases, and the straight bond value falls. The vertical intercept in the figure shows the value of the bond when the stock price equals zero. You can interpret this as the value the bondholders would receive if the firm were to enter bankruptcy and the shares become worthless. Panel B shows the conversion value of the bond. Panel C compares the value of the convertible bond to these two lower bounds.
Figure 20.12 Value of a convertible bond as a function of stock price. Panel A, Straight debt value, or bond floor. Panel B, Conversion value of the bond. Panel C, Total value of convertible bond.


When stock prices are low, the straight bond value is the effective lower bound, and the conversion option is nearly irrelevant. The convertible will trade like straight debt. When stock prices are high, the bond's price is determined by its conversion value. With conversion all but guaranteed, the bond is essentially equity in disguise. We can illustrate with two examples, as shown in Table 20.6.

Bond  $A$  has a conversion value of only  $\$600$ . Its value as straight debt, in contrast, is  $\$967$ . This is the present value of the coupon and principal payments at a market rate for straight debt of  $8.5\%$ . The bond's price is  $\$972$ , so the premium over the straight bond value is only  $\$5$ , reflecting the low probability of conversion. Its reported yield to maturity based on scheduled coupon payments and the market price of  $\$972$  is  $8.42\%$ , close to that of straight debt.

The conversion option on bond  $B$  is in the money. Conversion value is  \$1,250, and the bond's price,\$ 1,255, reflects its value as equity (plus 5 for the protection the bond offers against stock price declines). The bond's reported yield is 4.76\%, far below the comparable yield on straight debt. The big yield sacrifice is attributable to the far greater value of the conversion option.

In theory, we could value convertible bonds by treating them as straight debt plus call options. In practice, however, this approach is often impractical for several reasons:

1. The conversion price frequently increases over time, which means the exercise price of the option changes.
2. Stocks may pay several dividends over the life of the bond, further complicating the option-valuation analysis.
3. Most convertibles also are callable at the discretion of the firm. In essence, both the investor and the issuer hold options on each other. If the issuer exercises its call option to repurchase the bond, the bondholders typically have a month during which they still can convert. When issuers use a call option, knowing bondholders will choose to convert, the issuer is said to have forced a conversion. These conditions together mean the actual maturity of the bond is indeterminate.

# Table 20.6

Two convertible bonds

# Warrants

Warrants are essentially call options issued by a firm. The important difference between calls and warrants is that exercise of a warrant requires the firm to issue a new share of stock—the total number of shares outstanding increases. Exercise of a call option requires only that the writer of the call deliver an already-issued share of stock, so the number of shares outstanding remains fixed. Also unlike call options, warrants provide a cash flow to the firm when the warrant holder pays the exercise price. These differences mean that warrant values will differ somewhat from the values of call options with identical terms.

Like convertible debt, warrant terms may be tailored to meet the needs of the firm. Also like convertible debt, warrants generally are protected against stock splits and dividends in that the exercise price and the number of warrants held are adjusted to offset the effects of the split.

Warrants are often issued in conjunction with another security. Bonds, for example, may be packaged together with a warrant "sweetener," frequently a warrant that may be sold separately. This is called a detachable warrant.

Warrants and convertible securities create the potential for an increase in outstanding shares of stock if exercise occurs. Exercise obviously would affect financial statistics that are computed on a per-share basis, so annual reports must include earnings per share figures under the assumption that all convertible securities and warrants are exercised. These figures are called fully diluted earnings per share.

# Collateralized Loans

Many loan arrangements require that the borrower put up collateral to guarantee the loan will be paid back. In the event of default, the lender takes possession of the collateral. A nonrecourse loan gives the lender no recourse beyond the right to the collateral. That is, the lender may not sue the borrower for further payment if the collateral turns out not to be valuable enough to repay the loan.

Assume the borrower is obligated to pay back  $L$  dollars at the maturity of the loan. The collateral will be worth  $S_{T}$  dollars at maturity. (Its value today is  $S_{0}$ .) The borrower has the option to wait until the loan is due and repay it only if the collateral is worth more than  $L$  dollars. If the collateral is worth less than  $L$ , the borrower can default on the loan and discharge the obligation by forfeiting the collateral, which is worth only  $S_{T}$ .

Another way of describing such a loan is to view the borrower as turning over the collateral to the lender but retaining the right to reclaim it by paying off the loan. In effect, the borrower turns over collateral but keeps an option to "repurchase" it for  $L$  dollars at the maturity of the loan if  $L$  turns out to be less than  $S_{T}$ . This is a call option.

A third way to look at a collateralized loan is to assume that the borrower will repay the  $L$  dollars with certainty but also retain the option to sell the collateral to the lender for  $L$  dollars, even if  $S_{T}$  is less than  $L$ . In this case, the sale of the collateral would generate the cash necessary to satisfy the loan. The ability to "sell" the collateral for  $L$  dollars represents a put option, which guarantees the borrower can raise enough money to satisfy the loan simply by turning over the collateral.

It is perhaps surprising that we can describe the same loan as involving either a put option or a call option, as their payoffs are so different. Yet the equivalence of the two approaches is nothing more than a reflection of put-call parity. In our call-option description of the loan, the value of the borrower's liability is  $S_0 - C_0$ : The borrower turns over the asset, which is a transfer of  $S_0$  dollars, but retains a call worth  $C_0$  dollars. In the put-option description, the borrower is obligated to pay  $L$  dollars but retains the put, which is currently worth  $P_0$ : The present value of this net obligation is  $L / (1 + r_f)^T - P_0$ . Because these alternative descriptions are equivalent ways of viewing the same loan, the value of the obligations must be equal:

$$
S _ {0} - C _ {0} = \frac {L}{\left(1 + r _ {f}\right) ^ {T}} - P _ {0} \tag {20.3}
$$

Treating  $L$  as the exercise price of the option, Equation 20.3 is simply the put-call parity relationship.

Figure 20.13 illustrates these different ways to view the loan. Figure 20.13, Panel A, is the value of the payment to be received by the lender, which equals the minimum of  $S_{T}$  or  $L$ . Panel B shows that this amount can be expressed as  $S_{T}$  minus the payoff of the call implicitly written by the lender and held by the borrower. Panel C shows it also can be viewed as a receipt of  $L$  dollars minus the proceeds of a put option.

# Levered Equity and Risky Debt

Investors holding stock in incorporated firms are protected by limited liability, which means that if the firm cannot pay its debts, its creditors may attach its assets but cannot not sue the equityholders for further payment. In effect, any time the corporation borrows money, the maximum possible collateral is the total of its assets. If the firm declares bankruptcy, we can interpret this as an admission that the firm's assets are insufficient to satisfy the claims against it. The corporation may discharge its obligations by transferring ownership its assets to the creditors.

Just as is true for nonrecourse collateralized loans, the required payment to the creditors represents the exercise price of the implicit option, while the value of the firm is the underlying asset. The equityholders have a put option to transfer their ownership claims on the firm to the creditors in return for the face value of the firm's debt.

Alternatively, we may view the equityholders as retaining a call option. They have, in effect, already transferred their ownership claim to the firm to the creditors but have retained the right to reacquire that claim by paying off the loan. Hence, the equityholders have an implicit call option to "buy back" the firm for a specified price.

The significance of this observation is that analysts can value corporate bonds using option-pricing techniques. The default premium required of risky debt in principle can be estimated by using option-valuation models. We consider some of these models in Chapter 21.

# 20.6 Financial Engineering

One of the attractions of options is their ability to create investment positions with payoffs that depend in a variety of ways on the values of other securities. This capability was the key to the various options strategies examined in Section 20.4.

Options also can be used to custom-design new securities or portfolios with desired patterns of exposure to the price of an underlying security. In this sense, options (and futures contracts, to be discussed in Chapters 22 and 23) provide the ability to engage in financial engineering, the creation of portfolios with specified payoff patterns.

A good example of financial engineering is the index-linked certificate of deposit. Index-linked CDs enable retail investors to take small positions in index options. Unlike conventional CDs, which pay a fixed rate of interest, these CDs pay depositors a specified fraction of the rate of return on a market index such as the

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/ef2e34158b6808bb53ad42c1eac47337def37de7c4242274698291514914b679.jpg)
Figure 20.14 Return on index-linked CD

S&P 500, while guaranteeing a minimum rate of return should the market fall. For example, the index-linked CD may offer  $70\%$  of any market increase but protect its holder from any market decrease by guaranteeing at least no loss.

The index-linked CD is clearly a type of call option. If the market rises, the depositor profits according to the participation rate or multiplier, in this case  $70\%$ ; if the market falls, the investor is insured against loss. Just as clearly, the bank offering these CDs is in effect writing call options and can hedge its position by buying index calls in the options market. Figure 20.14 shows the nature of the bank's obligation to its depositors.

How might the bank set the appropriate multiplier? To answer this, note various features of the option:

1. The price the depositor is paying for the options is the forgone interest on the conventional CD that could be purchased. Because interest is received at the end of the period, the present value of the interest payment on each dollar invested is  $r_f / (1 + r_f)$ . Therefore, the depositor trades a sure payment with present value per dollar invested of  $r_f / (1 + r_f)$  for a return that depends on the market's performance. Conversely, the bank can fund its obligation using the interest that it would have paid on a conventional CD.
2. The option we have described is an at-the-money option, meaning that the exercise price equals the current value of the stock index. The option goes into the money if the market index increases from its level at the inception of the contract.
3. We can analyze the option on a per-dollar-invested basis. For example, the option costs the depositor  $r_f / (1 + r_f)$  dollars per dollar placed in the index-linked CD. The market price of the option per dollar invested is  $C_0 / S_0$ : The at-the-money option costs  $C_0$  dollars and is written on one unit of the market index, currently at  $S_0$ .

Now it is easy to determine the multiplier that the bank can offer on the CDs. It receives from its depositors an implicit "payment" of  $r_f / (1 + r_f)$  per dollar invested. It costs the bank  $C_0 / S_0$  to purchase the call option on a 1 investment in the market index.

Therefore, if  r_f / (1 + r_f)  is, for example,  70\%  of  C_0 / S_0 , the bank can purchase at most .7 call option on the 1 investment and the multiplier will be .7. More generally, the break-even multiplier on an index-linked CD is  r_f / (1 + r_f)  divided by  C_0 / S_0 .

# Example 20.7 Indexed-Linked CDs

Suppose that  $r_f = 6\%$  per year, that 6-month maturity at-the-money calls on the market index currently cost \$50, and that the index is at 1,000. Then the option costs  $50 / 1,000 = $.05\$  per dollar of market value. The CD rate is  $3\%$  per 6 months, meaning that  $r_f / (1 + r_f) = .03 / 1.03 = .0291$ . Therefore, the multiplier would be  $.0291 / .05 = .5825$ .

The index-linked CD has several variants. Investors can purchase similar CDs that guarantee a positive minimum return if they are willing to settle for a smaller multiplier. In this case, the option is "purchased" by the depositor for  $(r_f - r_{\mathrm{min}}) / (1 + r_f)$  dollars per dollar invested, where  $r_{\mathrm{min}}$  is the guaranteed minimum return. Because the purchase price is lower, fewer options can be purchased, which results in a lower multiplier. Another variant of the "bullish" CD we have described is the bear CD, which pays depositors a fraction of any fall in the market index. For example, a bear CD might offer a rate of return of .6 times any percentage decline in the S&P 500. This arrangement implicitly conveys put options to the investor.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/ce7b165912332d0cd13fb34e363b73e6108a5e7bdc29cb12778cf192eeebfdb5.jpg)

# Concept Check 20.9

Continue to assume that  r_f = 3\%  per half-year, that at-the-money calls sell for 50, and that the market index is at 1,000. What would be the multiplier for 6-month bullish equity-linked CDs offering a guaranteed minimum return of .5\% over the term of the CD?

# 20.7 Exotic Options

Options markets have been tremendously successful. Investors clearly value the strategies that options make possible; this is reflected in the heavy trading volume in these markets. Success breeds imitation, and there has been tremendous innovation in the range of option instruments available to investors. Part of this innovation has occurred in the market for customized options, which now trade in active over-the-counter markets. Many of these options have terms that would have been highly unusual even 25 years ago; they are therefore called exotic options. In this section, we survey a few of the more interesting variants of these new instruments.

# Asian Options

You already have been introduced to American- and European-style options. Asian-style options are options with payoffs that depend on the average price of the underlying asset during at least some portion of the life of the option. For example, an Asian call option may have a payoff equal to the average stock price over the last three months minus the strike price if that difference is positive, and zero otherwise. These options may be of interest, for example, to firms that wish to hedge a profit stream that depends on the average price of a commodity over some period of time.

# Barrier Options

Barrier options have payoffs that depend not only on some asset price at option expiration, but also on whether the underlying asset price has crossed through some "barrier." For example, a down-and-out option is one type of barrier option that automatically expires worthless if and when the stock price falls below some barrier price. Similarly, down-and-in options will not provide a payoff unless the stock price does fall below some barrier at least once during the life of the option. These options also are referred to as knock-out and knock-in options.

# Lookback Options

Lookback options have payoffs that depend in part on the minimum or maximum price of the underlying asset during the life of the option. For example, a lookback call option might provide a payoff equal to the maximum stock price during the life of the option minus the exercise price, instead of the final stock price minus the exercise price. Such an option provides (for a price, of course) a form of perfect market timing, providing the call holder with a payoff equal to the one that would accrue if the asset were purchased for  $X$  dollars and later sold at what turns out to be its high price.

# Currency-Translated Options

Currency-translated options have either asset or exercise prices denominated in a foreign currency. For example, the quanto allows an investor to fix in advance the exchange rate at which an investment in a foreign currency can be converted back into dollars. The right to translate a fixed amount of foreign currency into dollars at a given exchange rate is a simple foreign exchange option. Quantos are more interesting because the amount of currency that will be translated into dollars depends on the performance of the foreign investment. Therefore, a quanto in effect provides a random number of options.

# Digital Options

Digital options, also called binary or "bet" options, have fixed payoffs that depend on whether a condition is satisfied by the price of the underlying asset. For example, a digital call option might pay off a fixed amount of 100 if the stock price at maturity exceeds the exercise price.

1. A call option is the right to buy an asset at an agreed-upon exercise price. A put option is the right to sell an asset at a given exercise price.
2. American-style options allow exercise on or before the expiration date. European options allow exercise only on the expiration date. Most traded options are American style.
3. Options are traded on stocks, stock indexes, foreign currencies, fixed-income securities, and several futures contracts.
4. Options can be used either to lever up an investor's exposure to an asset price or to provide insurance against volatility of asset prices. Popular option strategies include covered calls, protective puts, straddles, spreads, and collars.
5. The put-call parity theorem relates the prices of put and call options. If the relationship is violated, arbitrage opportunities will result. Specifically, the parity relationship states that

$$
P _ {0} = C _ {0} - S _ {0} + \mathrm {P V} (X) + \mathrm {P V} (\text {d i v i d e n d s})
$$

SUMMARY where  $X$  is the exercise price of both the call and the put options,  $\mathrm{PV}(X)$  is the present value of a claim to  $X$  dollars to be paid at the expiration date of the options, and  $\mathrm{PV}(\mathrm{dividends})$  is the present value of dividends to be paid before option expiration.


6. Many commonly traded securities embody option characteristics. Examples of these securities are callable bonds, convertible bonds, and warrants. Other arrangements such as collateralized loans and limited-liability borrowing can be analyzed as conveying implicit options to one or more parties.
7. Trading in so-called exotic options now takes place in an active over-the-counter market.

10. An investor purchases a stock for \$38 and a put for $.50 with a strike price of \$35. The investor also sells a call for $.50 with a strike price of 40. What are the maximum possible profit and loss for this position? Draw the profit and loss diagram for this strategy as a function of the stock price at expiration.
 11. Imagine that you are holding 5,000 shares of stock, currently selling at \$40 per share. You are ready to sell the shares but would prefer to put off the sale until next year for tax reasons. If you continue to hold the shares until January, however, you face the risk that the stock will drop in value before year-end. You decide to use a collar to limit downside risk without laying out a good deal of additional funds. January call options with a strike price of \$45 are selling at \$2, and January puts with a strike price of \$35 are selling at \$3. What will be the value of your portfolio in January (net of the proceeds from the options) if the stock price ends up at: (a) $30, (b) $40, or (c) \$50? Compare these proceeds to what you would realize if you simply continued to hold the shares.
 12. In this problem, we derive the put-call parity relationship for European options on stocks that pay dividends before option expiration. For simplicity, assume that the stock makes one dividend payment of $D per share at the expiration date of the option.

$a$ . What is the value of a stock-plus-put position on the expiration date of the option?
b. Now consider a portfolio comprising a call option and a zero-coupon bond with the same maturity date as the option and with face value  $(X + D)$ . What is the value of this portfolio on the option expiration date? You should find that its value equals that of the stock-plus-put portfolio regardless of the stock price.
c. What is the cost of establishing the two portfolios in parts  $(a)$  and  $(b)$ ? Equate the costs of these portfolios, and you will derive the put-call parity relationship, Equation 20.2.

13. a. A butterfly spread is the purchase of one call at exercise price  $X_{1}$ , the sale of two calls at exercise price  $X_{2}$ , and the purchase of one call at exercise price  $X_{3}$ .  $X_{1}$  is less than  $X_{2}$ , and  $X_{2}$  is less than  $X_{3}$  by equal amounts, and all calls have the same expiration date. Graph the payoff diagram to this strategy.

b. A vertical combination is the purchase of a call with exercise price  $X_{2}$  and a put with exercise price  $X_{1}$ , with  $X_{2}$  greater than  $X_{1}$ . Graph the payoff to this strategy.

14. A bearish spread is the purchase of a call with exercise price  $X_{2}$  and the sale of a call with exercise price  $X_{1}$ , with  $X_{2}$  greater than  $X_{1}$ . Graph the payoff to this strategy and compare it to Figure 20.10.

15. Jane Joseph, a manager at Computer Science, Inc. (CSI), received 10,000 shares of company stock as part of her compensation package. The stock currently sells at \$40 a share. She would like to defer selling the stock until the next tax year. In January, however, she will need to sell all of her holdings to provide for a down payment on a new house. Joseph is worried about the price risk involved in holding on to the shares. At current prices, she would receive \$400,000 for the stock. If the value of her stock holdings falls below \$350,000, her ability to come up with the necessary down payment would be jeopardized. On the other hand, if the stock value rises to \$450,000, she would be able to maintain a small cash reserve even after making the down payment. Joseph considers three investment strategies: a. Strategy A is to write January call options on the CSI shares with strike price \$45. These calls are currently selling for \$3 each.

b. Strategy B is to buy January put options on CSI with strike price  \$35. These options also sell for\$ 3 each.
c. Strategy C is to establish a zero-cost collar by writing the January calls and buying the January puts.

Evaluate each of these strategies with respect to Joseph's investment goals. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Which would you recommend?

29. You think there is great upward potential in the stock market and would like to participate in the upward move if it materializes. However, you cannot afford substantial investment losses and so cannot run the risk of a stock market collapse, which you think is also a possibility. Your investment adviser therefore suggests a protective put position: Buy both shares in a market index stock fund and put options on those shares with 3-month expiration and exercise price of \$2,340. The stock index fund is currently selling for \$2,700. However, your uncle suggests you instead buy a 3-month call option on the index fund with exercise price \$2,520 and buy 3-month T-bills with face value \$2,520.

a. On the same graph, draw the payoffs to each of these strategies as a function of the stock fund value in three months. (Hint: Think of the options as being on one "share" of the stock index fund, with the current price of each share of the fund equal to 2,700.) b. Which portfolio must require a greater initial outlay to establish? (Hint: Does either portfolio provide a final payout that is always at least as great as the payoff of the other portfolio?)
$c$ . Suppose the market prices of the securities are as follows:

Stock fund 2,700

T-bill (face value  $2,520)$ 2,430

Call (exercise price $2,520) $360

Put (exercise price 2,340)

Make a table of the profits realized for each portfolio for the following values of the stock price in three months:  $S_{T} = \2,000$ ,  $\$ 2,520 ,  $\2,700$ ,  $\$ 2,880 . Graph the profits to each portfolio as a function of  $S_{T}$  on a single graph.

$d$ . Which strategy is riskier? Which should have a higher beta?
e. Explain why the data for the securities given in part (c) do not violate the put-call parity relationship.

30. Netflix is selling for \$100 a share. A Netflix call option with one month until expiration and an exercise price of \$105 sells for \$2 while a put with the same strike and expiration sells for \$6.94. What must be the market price of a zero-coupon bond with face value 105 and 1-month maturity? What is the risk-free interest rate expressed as an effective annual yield?

31. Demonstrate that an at-the-money call option on a given stock must cost more than an at-the-money put option on that stock with the same expiration. The stock will pay no dividends until after the expiration date. (Hint: Use put-call parity to show that  $C_0 - P_0$  must be positive.)

1. Donna Donie, CFA, has a client who believes the common stock price of TRT Materials (currently 58 per share) could move substantially in either direction in reaction to an expected court decision involving the company. The client currently owns no TRT shares but asks Donie for advice about implementing a strangle strategy to capitalize on the possible stock price movement. A strangle is a portfolio of a put and a call with a higher exercise price but the same expiration date. Donie gathers the TRT option-pricing data:

<table><tr><td>Characteristic</td><td>Call Option</td><td>Put Option</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>$ 5</td><td>$ 4</td></tr><tr><td>Strike price</td><td>$60</td><td>$55</td></tr><tr><td>Time to expiration</td><td>90 days from now</td><td>90 days from now</td></tr></table> a.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. a. Denote the stock price at call option expiration by S_T, and the exercise price by X. Value at expiration = S_T - X = S_T - 300 if this value is positive; otherwise the call expires worthless.

Profit = Final value - Price of call option = Proceeds - 11.75

<table><tr><td></td><td>S_T = $280</td><td>S_T = $320</td></tr><tr><td>Proceeds</td><td>$ 0</td><td>$20</td></tr><tr><td>Profits</td><td>-$11.75</td><td>$ 8.25</td></tr></table> b. Value at expiration = X - S_{T} = \300 - S_{T} if this value is positive; otherwise the put expires worthless.


Profit = Final value - Price of put option = Proceeds - 16.25

<table><tr><td></td><td>S_T = $280</td><td>S_T = $320</td></tr><tr><td>Proceeds</td><td>$20</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>Profits</td><td>+$3.75</td><td>-$16.25</td></tr></table>

2. Before the split, the final payoff would have been 100 × ($160 - $150) = \$1,000. After the split, the payoff is 200 × ($80 - $75) = \$1,000. The payoff is unaffected.

$b$ . The payoffs and profits to both buying calls and writing puts generally are higher when the stock price is higher. In this sense, both positions are bullish. Both involve potentially taking delivery of the stock. However, the call holder will choose to take delivery when the stock price is high, while the put writer is obligated to take delivery when the stock price is low.

c. The payoffs and profits to both writing calls and buying puts generally are higher when the stock price is lower. In this sense, both positions are bearish.

The graph of the payoff (on a per-share basis) is as follows. If you multiply the per-share values by 2,000, you will see that the collar provides a minimum payoff of  \$180,000 (representing a maximum loss of\$ 20,000) and a maximum payoff of 220,000 (which is the cost of the house).

6. The covered call strategy would consist of a straight bond with a call written on the bond. The value of the strategy at option expiration as a function of the value of the straight bond is given by the solid-colored payoff line in the following figure, which is virtually identical to Figure 20.11.

7. The call option is worth less as call protection is expanded. Therefore, the coupon rate need not be as high.
8. Lower. Investors will accept a lower coupon rate in return for the conversion option.
 9. The depositor's implicit cost per dollar invested is now only ($.03 - $.005)/1.03 = $.02427 per 6-month period. Calls cost 50/1,000 = $.05 per dollar invested in the index. The multiplier falls to .02427/.05 = .4854.

# Option Valuation

# 21

IN THE PREVIOUS chapter, we examined option markets and strategies. We saw that many securities contain embedded options that affect both their values and their risk-return characteristics. In this chapter, we ask how options are valued. Most option-valuation models require a considerable background in statistics. Still, many of the ideas and insights of these models can be demonstrated in simple examples, and we will concentrate on these.

We start with a discussion of the factors that ought to affect option prices. After this discussion, we present several bounds within which option prices must lie. Next we turn to quantitative models, starting with a simple "two-state" option-valuation model and then showing how this approach can be generalized into a useful and accurate pricing tool. We then move on to one particular valuation formula, the famous Black-Scholes model. Finally, we look at some of the more important applications of option-pricing theory in portfolio management and control.


Option-pricing models allow us to "back out" market estimates of stock-price volatility, and we will examine these measures of implied volatility. Next we turn to some of the more important applications of option-pricing theory in risk management. Finally, we take a brief look at some of the empirical evidence on option pricing and the implications of that evidence concerning the limitations of the Black-Scholes model.

# 21.1 Option Valuation: Introduction

# Intrinsic and Time Values

Consider a call option that is out of the money at the moment, with the stock price below the exercise price. This does not mean the option is valueless. Even though immediate exercise would be unprofitable, the call still has value because there is always a chance the stock price will rise above the exercise price by the expiration date. If not, the worst that can happen is that the option will expire with zero value.

The value  $S_0 - X$  is called the intrinsic value of in-the-money call options because it gives the payoff that could be obtained by immediate exercise. Intrinsic value is set equal to zero for out-of-the-money or at-the-money options. The difference between price and intrinsic value is commonly called the option's time value.

"Time value" is unfortunate terminology because it may confuse the option's time value with the time value of money. Time value in the options context refers simply to the difference between the option's price and the value it would have if it were expiring immediately. It is the part of the option's value that may be attributed to its remaining time to expiration.

Most of an option's time value typically is a type of "volatility value." Even if immediate exercise would be unprofitable, the call still has value because there is always a chance the stock price will rise above the exercise price by the expiration date. But if it does not, the worst that can happen is that the option will expire with zero value. The volatility value lies in the value of the right not to exercise if that action would be unprofitable.

As the stock price increases, it becomes increasingly likely that the call will be exercised by expiration. Ultimately, with exercise all but assured, the volatility value becomes minimal. As the stock price gets ever larger, the option value approaches the "adjusted" intrinsic value, the stock price minus the present value of the exercise price,  $S_0 - \mathrm{PV}(X)$ .

Why should this be? If you are virtually certain the option will be exercised and the stock purchased for  $X$  dollars, it is as though you own the stock already. You will almost certainly own it shortly. You just haven't paid for it yet. You will pay the exercise price, so the present value of your obligation is the present value of  $X$ ; therefore, the net value of the call option is  $S_0 - \mathrm{PV}(X)$ .

Figure 21.1 illustrates the call option valuation function. The value curve shows that when the stock price is very low, the option is nearly worthless because there is almost no chance that it will be exercised. When the stock price is very high, the option value approaches adjusted intrinsic value. In the midrange case, where the option is approximately at the money, the option curve diverges from the straight lines corresponding to adjusted intrinsic value. This is because although exercise today would have a negligible (or negative) payoff, the volatility value of the option is quite high in this region.

The call always increases in value with the stock price. The slope is greatest, however, when the option is deep in the money. In this case, exercise is all but assured, and the option price increases one-for-one with the stock price.

# Determinants of Option Values

We can identify at least six variables that should affect the value of a call option: the stock price, the exercise price, the volatility of the stock price, the time to expiration, the interest rate, and the dividend rate of the stock. The value of the call option should increase with the stock price and decrease with the exercise price because the payoff to a call, if exercised, equals  $S_{T} - X$ . The expected payoff increases with the difference  $S_{0} - X$ .

Figure 21.1 Call option value before expiration

Call option values also increase with the volatility of the underlying stock price. To see why, compare a scenario where possible stock prices at expiration may range from  $10 to$ 50 to one where they range only from  $20 to$ 40. In both cases, the expected, or average, stock price will be \$30. Suppose the exercise price on a call option is also \$30. What are the option payoffs?

<table><tr><td colspan="6">High-Volatility Scenario</td></tr><tr><td>Stock price</td><td>$10</td><td>$20</td><td>$30</td><td>$40</td><td>\$50</td></tr><tr><td>Option payoff</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Low-Volatility Scenario</td></tr><tr><td>Stock price</td><td>$20</td><td>$25</td><td>$30</td><td>$35</td><td>\$40</td></tr><tr><td>Option payoff</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>10</td></tr></table>

If each outcome is equally likely, with probability .2, the expected payoff in the high-volatility scenario is \$6, but with low volatility, the expected payoff is half as much, only \$3.

The higher option value when share price volatility is higher reflects the volatility value of the call. No matter how far below 30 the stock price drops, the option holder will get zero. Extremely poor stock price performance is no worse for the call option holder than moderately poor performance.

# Table 21.1

Determinants of call option values

<table><tr><td>If This Variable Increases . . .</td><td>The Value of a Call Option</td></tr><tr><td>Stock price, S</td><td>Increases</td></tr><tr><td>Exercise price, X</td><td>Decreases</td></tr><tr><td>Volatility, σ</td><td>Increases</td></tr><tr><td>Time to expiration, T</td><td>Increases</td></tr><tr><td>Interest rate, rf</td><td>Increases</td></tr><tr><td>Dividend payouts</td><td>Decreases</td></tr></table>

When the share price increases, however, the call will expire in the money, and will be more profitable the higher the stock price. Thus, extremely good stock outcomes improve the option payoff without limit, but extremely poor outcomes cannot worsen the payoff below zero. This asymmetry means that volatility in the underlying stock price increases the expected payoff to the option, thereby enhancing its value.[2]

# Concept Check 21.1

Use the high and low volatility scenarios that we used for the call option to show that put options also are worth more when stock price volatility is higher.

Similarly, longer time to expiration increases the value of a call option. For more distant expiration dates, there is more time for unpredictable future events to affect prices, and the range of likely stock prices increases. This has an effect similar to that of increased volatility. Moreover, as time to expiration lengthens, the present value of the exercise price falls, which also benefits the call option holder. As a corollary to this issue, call option values are higher when interest rates rise (holding the stock price constant) because higher interest rates also reduce the present value of the exercise price.

Finally, the dividend payout policy of the firm affects option values. A high-dividend payout policy puts a drag on the rate of growth of the stock price. For any expected total rate of return on the stock, a higher dividend yield must imply a lower expected rate of capital gain. This drag decreases the potential payoff from the call option, thereby reducing its value. Table 21.1 summarizes these relationships.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/85393518f2a6a2d0c464457969ff3133106d0236ccb1c0109782a4164d0fc285.jpg)

# Concept Check 21.2

Prepare a table like Table 21.1 for the determinants of put option values. How should American put values respond to increases in  $S$ ,  $X$ ,  $\sigma$ ,  $T$ ,  $r_f$ , and dividend payouts?

2You should be careful interpreting the relationship between volatility and option value. Neither the focus of this analysis on total (as opposed to systematic) volatility nor the conclusion that options buyers seem to like volatility contradicts modern portfolio theory. In conventional discounted cash flow analysis, we find the discount rate appropriate for a given distribution of future cash flows. Greater risk implies a higher discount rate and lower present value. Here, however, the expected cash flow from the option depends on the volatility of the stock. The option value increases not because traders like risk but because the option's expected payoff increases along with the volatility of the underlying asset.

# 21.2 Restrictions on Option Values

Several quantitative models of option pricing have been devised, and we will examine some of them later in this chapter. They all, however, rely on simplifying assumptions. You might wonder which properties of option values are truly general and which depend on particular simplifications. Therefore, we begin with some of the more important general properties of option prices.

# Restrictions on the Value of a Call Option

The most obvious restriction on the value of a call option is that its value cannot be negative. Its payoff is zero at worst, and possibly positive, so it has some positive value.

We can place another lower bound on the value of a call option. Suppose that the stock will pay a dividend of D dollars just before the option expiration date, denoted by T (where today is time 0). Now compare two portfolios, one consisting of a call option on one share of stock and the other a leveraged equity position consisting of that share and borrowing of (X + D) / (1 + r_f)^T dollars. The loan repayment is X + D dollars, due on the expiration date of the option. For example, for a one-year maturity option with exercise price 70, dividends to be paid of 5, and an effective annual interest of 5\%, you would purchase one share of stock and borrow 75/1.05 = \$71.43. In one year, when the loan matures, the payment due is \$75. At that time, the payoff to the leveraged equity position is given by the following table (where S_T denotes the stock price at the option expiration date).

<table><tr><td></td><td>In General</td><td>Our Numbers</td></tr><tr><td>Stock value</td><td>ST+D</td><td>ST+5</td></tr><tr><td>– Payback of loan</td><td>-(X+D)</td><td>-75</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>ST-X</td><td>ST-70</td></tr></table>

Notice that the payoff to the stock is the ex-dividend stock price plus dividends received. Whether the total payoff to the stock-plus-borrowing position is positive or negative depends on whether  S_{T}  exceeds  X . The net cash outlay required to establish this leveraged equity position is  S_{0} - \71.43 , or, more generally,  S_{0} - (X + D) / (1 + r_{f})^{T} , that is, the current price of the stock,  S_{0} , less the initial cash inflow from the borrowing position.

The payoff to the call will be  $S_{T} - X$  if the option expires in the money and zero otherwise. Thus, the option payoff equals the leveraged equity payoff when that payoff is positive and is greater when the leveraged equity position has a negative payoff. Because the option's payoff is always greater than or equal to that of the leveraged equity position, its price must exceed the cost of establishing that position.

Therefore, the value of the call must be greater than  $S_0 - (X + D) / (1 + r_f)^T$ , or, more generally,

$$
C _ {0} \geq S _ {0} - \operatorname {P V} (X) - \operatorname {P V} (D)
$$ where  $\mathrm{PV}(X)$  denotes the present value of the exercise price and  $\mathrm{PV}(D)$  is the present value of the dividends the stock will pay at the option's expiration. More generally, we can interpret  $\mathrm{PV}(D)$  as the present value of any and all dividends to be paid prior to the option expiration date. Because we know already that the value of a call option must be nonnegative, we conclude that  $C_0$  is greater than the maximum of either 0 or  $S_0 - \mathrm{PV}(X) - \mathrm{PV}(D)$ .

Figure 21.3 Call option value as a function of the current stock price

We also can place an upper bound on the value of the call; this bound is simply the stock price. No one would pay more than  $S_0$  dollars for the right to purchase a stock currently worth  $S_0$  dollars. Thus  $C_0 \leq S_0$ .

Figure 21.2 demonstrates graphically the range of prices that is ruled out by these upper and lower bounds for the value of a call option. Values outside the shaded area are not possible. Before expiration, the call option value normally will be within the allowable range, touching neither the upper nor lower bound, as in Figure 21.3.

# Early Exercise and Dividends

A call option holder who wants to close out that position has two choices: exercise the call or sell it. If it is exercised at time  $t$ , the call will provide a payoff of  $S_{t} - X$ , assuming, of course, that the option is in the money. We have just seen that the option can be sold for at least  $S_{t} - \mathrm{PV}(X) - \mathrm{PV}(D)$ . Therefore, if the stock does not pay a dividend, the call must be worth at least  $S_{t} - \mathrm{PV}(X)$ . Because the present value of  $X$  is less than  $X$  itself, it follows that

$$
C _ {t} \geq S _ {t} - \operatorname {P V} (X) > S _ {t} - X
$$

The implication here is that the proceeds from a sale of the option (at price  $C_t$ ) must exceed the proceeds from an exercise  $(S_t - X)$ . It is more attractive to sell the call, which keeps it alive, than to exercise and thereby end the option. In other words, calls on non-dividend-paying stocks must be "worth more alive than dead."

If it never pays to exercise a call option before expiration, the right to exercise early actually must be valueless. We conclude that the values of otherwise-identical American and European call options on stocks paying no dividends are equal. This simplifies matters because any valuation formula that applies to the European call, for which only one exercise date need be considered, also must apply to an American call.

As most stocks do pay dividends, you may wonder whether this result is just a theoretical curiosity. It is not: Reconsider our argument and you will see that all that we really require is that the stock pay no dividends until the option expires. This condition will be true for many real-world options.

# Early Exercise of American Puts

Early exercise of American put options sometimes will be rational regardless of dividends. To see why, start with an extreme example. Suppose that you purchase a put option, and almost immediately the firm goes bankrupt and its stock price falls to zero. Of course you want to exercise now because the stock price can fall no lower. Immediate exercise gives you immediate receipt of the exercise price, which can be invested to start generating income. Delay in exercise means a time-value-of-money cost. The right to exercise a put option before expiration must have value.

Now suppose instead that the firm is only nearly bankrupt, with the stock selling at just a few cents. Immediate exercise may still be optimal. After all, the stock price can fall by only a very small amount, meaning that the proceeds from future exercise cannot be more than a few cents greater than the proceeds from immediate exercise. Against this possibility of a tiny increase in proceeds must be weighed the time-value-of-money cost of deferring exercise. Clearly, there is some stock price below which early exercise is optimal.

This argument also proves that the American put must be worth more than its European counterpart. The American put allows you to exercise anytime before expiration. Because the right to exercise early may be useful in some circumstances, it will command a premium. The American put therefore will sell for a higher price than a European put with otherwise identical terms.

Figure 21.4, Panel A, illustrates the value of an American put option as a function of the current stock price,  $S_0$ . Once the stock price drops below a critical value, denoted  $S^*$  in the figure, exercise becomes optimal. At that point, the option-pricing curve is tangent to the straight line depicting the intrinsic value of the option. If and when the stock price reaches  $S^*$ , the put option is exercised and its payoff equals its intrinsic value.

In contrast, the value of the European put, which is graphed in Figure 21.4, Panel B, is not asymptotic to the intrinsic value line. Because early exercise is prohibited, the maximum value of the European put is  $\mathrm{PV}(X)$ , which occurs at the point  $S_0 = 0$ . Obviously, for a long enough horizon,  $\mathrm{PV}(X)$  can be made arbitrarily small.

# Concept Check 21.3

In light of this discussion, explain why the put-call parity relationship is valid only for European options on non-dividend-paying stocks. If the stock pays no dividends, what inequality for American options would correspond to the parity relation?

# 21.3 Binomial Option Pricing

# Two-State Option Pricing

A complete understanding of commonly used option-valuation formulas is difficult without a substantial mathematics background. Nevertheless, we can develop valuable insight from a simple special case. Assume a stock price can take only two possible values at option expiration: The stock will either increase to a given higher price or decrease to a given lower price. Although this may seem an extreme simplification, it provides a useful introduction to more complicated and realistic models. Moreover, it can be extended to describe far more reasonable specifications of stock price behavior. In fact, financial firms regularly employ variants of this simple model to value options and securities with option-like features.

Suppose the stock now sells at S0 = \$100, and the price will either increase by a multiple of u = 1.20 to \$120 (u stands for "up") or fall by a multiple of d = .9 to \$90 (d stands for "down") by year-end. A call option might specify an exercise price of \$110 and a time to expiration of one year. The interest rate is 10\%. At year-end, the payoff to the call will be either \$0, if the stock price falls, or \$10, if the stock price increases to 120.

These possibilities are illustrated by the following value "trees":

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/0275cd70f2c1abc39367a24c66a0aac951181174ccd2858fc3b6ee744ac013dd.jpg)

Call option value

Now compare the call's payoff to that of a portfolio consisting of one share of the stock and borrowing of 81.82 at the interest rate of 10\%. The payoff of this portfolio also depends on the stock price at year-end:

Value of stock at year-end

$90 $120

- Repayment of loan with interest

-90 -90

Total

$ 0 $ 30

We know the cash outlay to establish the portfolio is  $18.18:$ 100 for the stock, less the  $\$ 81.82$  proceeds from borrowing. Therefore, the portfolio’s value tree is

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/01a818982ae67b70537dd452ca2bf0ca71873a159d8e971981ea4459d52f4837.jpg)

The final payoff of this portfolio is exactly three times that of the call option for either value of the stock price. Because the portfolio replicates the payoff of the three calls, we call it a replicating portfolio. Moreover, because their payoffs are the same, the three calls and the replicating portfolio must have the same value. Therefore,

$$
3 C = \$ 18.18
$$ or each call should sell at  C = \6.06 . Thus, given the stock price, exercise price, interest rate, and volatility of the stock price (as represented by the spread between the up or down movements), we can derive the value of the call option.


Replication is behind most option-pricing formulas. For more complex stock price distributions, the replication technique is correspondingly more complex, but the principles remain the same.

One way to view the role of replication is to note that in this example, a portfolio made up of one share of stock and three call options written is perfectly hedged. Its year-end value is independent of the ultimate stock price:

<table><tr><td>Stock price</td><td>$90</td><td>$120</td></tr><tr><td>– Obligations from 3 calls written</td><td>-0</td><td>-30</td></tr><tr><td>Portfolio value</td><td>$90</td><td>$ 90</td></tr></table>

The investor has formed a riskless portfolio, with a payout of \$90. Its value must be the present value of \$90, or $90/1.10 = $81.82. The value of the portfolio, which equals \$100 from the stock held long, minus 3C from the three calls written, should equal \$81.82. Hence, $100 - 3C = $81.82, or C = 6.06.

The ability to create a perfect hedge is the key to this argument. The hedge locks in the end-of-year payout, which therefore can be discounted using the risk-free interest rate. We do not need to know either the option's or the stock's beta or expected rate of return. When a perfect hedge can be established, the final stock price does not affect the portfolio's payoff, so the stock's risk and return parameters have no bearing on the option's value.

The hedge ratio in this example is one share of stock to three calls, or one-third. This ratio has an easy interpretation: It is the ratio of the range of the values of the option to those of the stock across the two possible outcomes. The stock, which originally sells for  $S_0 = 100$ , will be worth either  $d \times \100 = \$ 90  or  $u \times \$100 = \$120\$ , for a range of  $\$30$ . If the stock price increases, the call will be worth  $C_u = \$10$ , whereas if the stock price decreases, the call will be worth  $C_d = 0$ , for a range of  $\$10$ . The ratio of ranges, 10/30, is one-third, which is the hedge ratio.

The hedge ratio equals the ratio of ranges because the option and stock are perfectly correlated in this two-state example. Because they are perfectly correlated, a perfect hedge requires that they be held in proportion to relative volatility.

We can generalize the hedge ratio,  $H$ , for other two-state option problems as

$$
H = \frac {C _ {u} - C _ {d}}{u S _ {0} - d S _ {0}}
$$ where  $C_u$  or  $C_d$  refers to the call option's value when the stock goes up or down, respectively, and  $uS_0$  and  $dS_0$  are the stock prices in the two states. If the investor writes one option and holds  $H$  shares of stock, the value of the portfolio will be unaffected by the stock price. In this case, option pricing is easy: Simply set the value of the hedged portfolio equal to the present value of the known payoff.


Using our example, the option-pricing technique would proceed as follows:

1. Given the possible end-of-year stock prices,  $uS_{0} = 120$  and  $dS_{0} = 90$ , and the exercise price of 110, calculate that  $C_{u} = 10$  and  $C_{d} = 0$ . The stock price range is 30, while the option price range is 10.
2. Find that the hedge ratio of  $10 / 30 = 1 / 3$
 3. Find that a portfolio made up of 1/3 share with one written option would have an end-of-year value of 30 with certainty.

4. Show that the present value of \$30 with a 1-year interest rate of 10\% is \$27.27.
5. Set the value of the hedged position to the present value of the certain payoff:

$$
\frac {1}{3} S _ {0} - C _ {0} = \$ 2 7. 2 7
$$

$$
\$ 33.33 - C _ {0} = \$ 27.27
$$

6. Solve for the call's value, C0 = 6.06.

What if the option is overpriced, perhaps selling for 6.50? Then you can make arbitrage profits by writing the overpriced option and hedging with shares. Here is how:

<table><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan="2">Cash Flow in 1 Year for Each Possible Stock Price</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Initial Cash Flow</td><td>S1=90</td><td>S1=120</td></tr><tr><td>1. Write 3 options</td><td>$ 19.50</td><td>$ 0</td><td>$-30</td></tr><tr><td>2. Purchase 1 share</td><td>-100</td><td>90</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>3. Borrow \$80.50 at 10\% interest; repay in 1 year</td><td>80.50</td><td>-88.55</td><td>-88.55</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>$ 0</td><td>$ 1.45</td><td>1.45</td></tr></table>

Although the net initial investment is zero, the payoff in one year is positive and riskless. If the option were underpriced, one would simply reverse this arbitrage strategy: Buy the option and sell the stock short to eliminate price risk. By the way, the present value of the profit to this arbitrage strategy exactly equals three times the amount by which the option is overpriced. The present value of the risk-free profit of  \$1.45 at a 10\% interest rate is\$ 1.318. With three options written in the strategy above, this translates to a profit of $.44 per option, exactly the amount by which the option was overpriced: \$6.50 versus the "fair value" of 6.06.

# Concept Check 21.4

Suppose the call option had been underpriced, selling at  \$5.50. Formulate the arbitrage strategy to exploit the mispricing, and show that it provides a riskless cash flow in one year of\$ 6167 per option purchased. Compare the present value of this cash flow to the option mispricing.

# Generalizing the Two-State Approach

Although the two-state stock price model seems overly simplistic, we can generalize it to incorporate more realistic assumptions. To start, suppose we break up the year into two 6-month segments, and assert that over each half-year, the stock price can take on two values. In this example, we will say it can increase  $10\%$  (i.e.,  $u = 1.10$ ) or decrease  $5\%$  (i.e.,  $d = .95$ ). A stock initially selling at 100 could follow these possible paths over the course of the year:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/b3b4961bbd4776c75710bb9750b149a4f4f646b8b36b7bb5930623feffd66fd7.jpg)

The midrange value of 104.50 can be attained by two paths: an increase of  $10\%$  followed by a decrease of  $5\%$ , or a decrease of  $5\%$  followed by a  $10\%$  increase.

There are now three possible end-of-year values for the stock and three for the option:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/f4293550bc4f86f34fb3e6fdfb17fd5f446e82639cd24a44cd3b4c942aa5863e.jpg)

Using methods similar to those we followed above, we could value  $C_u$  from knowledge of  $C_{uu}$  and  $C_{ud}$ , then value  $C_d$  from  $C_{du}$  and  $C_{dd}$ , and finally value  $C_0$  from  $C_u$  and  $C_d$ . And there is no reason to stop at 6-month intervals. We could next break the year into four 3-month units, or twelve 1-month units, or 365 1-day units, each of which would be posited to have a two-state process. Although the calculations become quite numerous and correspondingly tedious, they are easy to program into a computer or even a spreadsheet, and such programs are used widely by participants in the options market.

# Example 21.1 Binomial Option Pricing

Suppose the semiannual risk-free interest rate is 5\% and we want to value a one-year call option with exercise price \$110 on the stock described in the two-period price tree just above. We start by finding C_u, the value of the call in six months assuming the stock price has increased. From this point, the call can rise by year-end to an expiration-date value of C_u = \$11 (because at this point the stock price is u × u × S_0 = \$121) or fall to a final value of C_u d = 0 (because at this point the stock price is u × d × S_0 = \$104.50, which is less than the 110 exercise price). Therefore, the hedge ratio at this point is

$$
H = \frac {C _ {u u} - C _ {u d}}{u u S _ {0} - u d S _ {0}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 1 - 0}{\mathbb {S} 1 2 1 - 1 0 4 . 5 0} = \frac {2}{3}
$$

Thus, if the stock price rises in the first half-year period, the following portfolio will be worth 209 on the option expiration date regardless of the ultimate stock price:

<table><tr><td></td><td>udS0 = $104.50</td><td>uuS0 = $121</td></tr><tr><td>Buy 2 shares at price uS0 = $110</td><td>$209</td><td>\$242</td></tr><tr><td>Write 3 calls at price C_u</td><td>0</td><td>-33</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>\$209</td><td>209</td></tr></table>

The portfolio will have a market value in month 6 equal to the present value of 209 discounted by the semiannual interest rate:

$$
2 \times 1 1 0 - 3 C _ {u} = \$ 2 0 9 / 1. 0 5 = \$ 1 9 9. 0 4 7
$$

Solve to find that  $C_U = \$ 6.984$ .

Next we find the value of C_d. It is easy to see that this value must be zero. If we reach this point (corresponding to a stock price of \$95), the stock price at option expiration will be either \$104.50 or 90.25; in either case, the option will expire out of the money. (More formally, we could note that with C_ed = C_d_d = 0, the hedge ratio is zero, and a portfolio of zero shares will replicate the payoff of the call!)

Finally, we solve for  $C_0$  using the values of  $C_u$  and  $C_d$ . Concept Check 21.5 leads you through the calculations that show the option value to be 4.434.

# Making the Valuation Model Practical

As we break the year into progressively finer subintervals, the range of possible year-end stock prices expands. For example, when we increase the number of subperiods to three, the number of possible stock prices increases to four, as demonstrated in the following stock price tree:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/c0c50a2501352835a12e4bb204071a7218c302cf8b23c48939613a68db5c7ef3.jpg)

Thus, by allowing for an ever-greater number of subperiods, we can overcome one of the apparent limitations of the valuation model: that the number of possible end-of-period stock prices is small.

Notice that extreme events such as  $u^3 S_0$  or  $d^3 S_0$  are relatively rare, as they require either three consecutive increases or decreases in the three subintervals. More moderate, or mid-range, results such as  $u^2 dS_0$  can be arrived at by more than one path—any combination of two price increases and one decrease will result in stock price  $u^2 dS_0$ . There are three of these paths: uud, udu, duu. In contrast, only one path, uuu, results in a stock price of  $u^3 S_0$ . Thus, midrange values are more likely. As we make the model more realistic and break up the option maturity into more and more subperiods, the probability distribution for the final stock price begins to resemble the familiar bell-shaped curve, with highly unlikely extreme outcomes and far more likely midrange outcomes. The exact probability of each outcome is given by the binomial probability distribution, so this multiperiod approach to option pricing is called the binomial model.

But we still need to answer an important practical question. Before the binomial model can be used to value actual options, we need a way to choose reasonable values for  $u$  and  $d$ . The spread between up and down movements in the price of the stock reflects the volatility of its rate of return, so the choice for  $u$  and  $d$  should depend on that volatility. Call  $\sigma$  your estimate of the standard deviation of the stock's continuously compounded annualized rate of return and  $\Delta t$  the length of each subperiod. To make the standard deviation of the stock return match your estimate of  $\sigma$ , it turns out that you can set  $u = \exp(\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t})$  and  $d = \exp(-\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t})$ . You can see that the proportional difference between  $u$  and  $d$  increases with both annualized volatility as well as the length of the subperiod. This makes sense, as both higher  $\sigma$  and longer holding periods make future stock prices more uncertain. The following example illustrates how to use this calibration.

# Example 21.2 Calibrating  $u$  and  $d$  to Stock Volatility

Suppose you are using a 3-period model to value a one-year option on a stock with volatility (i.e., annualized standard deviation) of  $\sigma = .30$ . With a time to expiration of  $T = 1$  year, and  $n = 3$  subperiods, you would calculate  $\Delta t = T / n = 1 / 3$ ,  $u = \exp (\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}) = \exp (.30\sqrt{1 / 3}) = 1.189$ , and  $d = \exp (-\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}) = \exp (-.30\sqrt{1 / 3}) = .841$ . Given the probability of an up movement, you could then work out the probability of any final stock price. For example, suppose the probability that the stock price increases is .554 and the probability that it decreases is .446. Then the probability of stock prices at the end of the year would be as follows:

<table><tr><td>Event</td><td>Possible Paths</td><td>Probability</td><td>Final Stock Price</td></tr><tr><td>3 down movements</td><td>ddd</td><td>0.4463 = 0.089</td><td>59.48 = 100 × 0.8413</td></tr><tr><td>2 down and 1 up</td><td>ddu, dad, udd</td><td>3 × 0.4462 × 0.554 = 0.330</td><td>84.10 = 100 × 1.189 × 0.8412</td></tr><tr><td>1 down and 2 up</td><td>uud, udu, duu</td><td>3 × 0.446 × 0.5542 = 0.411</td><td>118.89 = 100 × 1.1892 × 0.841</td></tr><tr><td>3 up movements</td><td>uuu</td><td>0.5543 = 0.170</td><td>168.09 = 100 × 1.1893</td></tr></table>

We plot this probability distribution in Figure 21.5, Panel A. Notice that the two middle end-of-period stock prices are, in fact, more likely than either extreme.

Now we can extend Example 21.2 by breaking up the option maturity into ever-shorter subintervals. As we do, the stock price distribution becomes increasingly plausible, as we demonstrate in Example 21.3.

# Example 21.3 Increasing the Number of Subperiods

In Example 21.2, we broke up the year into three subperiods. Let's now look at the cases of 6 and 20 subperiods.

<table><tr><td>Subperiods, n</td><td>Δt = T/n</td><td>u = exp(σ√Δt)</td><td>d = exp(−σ√Δt)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0.333</td><td>exp(0.173) = 1.189</td><td>exp(−0.173) = 0.841</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>0.167</td><td>exp(0.122) = 1.130</td><td>exp(−0.122) = 0.885</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>0.050</td><td>exp(0.067) = 1.069</td><td>exp(−0.067) = 0.935</td></tr></table>

We plot the resulting probability distributions in Panels B and C of Figure 21.5.

4 Using this probability, the continuously compounded expected rate of return on the stock is .10. In general, the formula relating the probability of an upward movement to the annual expected rate of return,  $r$ , is  $p = \frac{\exp(r\Delta t) - d}{u - d}$ .
We adjust the probabilities of up versus down movements using the formula in footnote 4 to make the distributions in Figure 21.5 comparable. In each panel,  $p$  is chosen so that the stock's expected annualized, continuously compounded rate of return is  $10\%$ .

Notice that the right tail of the distribution in Panel C is noticeably longer than the left tail. In fact, as the number of intervals increases, the distribution progressively approaches the skewed log-normal (rather than the symmetric normal) distribution. Even if the stock price were to decline in each subinterval, it can never drop below zero. But there is no corresponding upper bound on its potential performance. This asymmetry gives rise to the skewness of the distribution.

Figure 21.5 Probability distributions for final stock price. Possible outcomes and associated probabilities. In each panel, the stock's annualized, continuously compounded expected rate of return is  $10\%$  and its standard deviation is  $30\%$ . Panel A. Three subintervals. In each subinterval, the stock can increase by  $18.9\%$  or fall by  $15.9\%$ . Panel B. Six subintervals. In each subinterval, the stock can increase by  $13.0\%$  or fall by  $11.5\%$ . Panel C. Twenty subintervals. In each subinterval, the stock can increase by  $6.9\%$  or fall by  $6.5\%$ .

Eventually, as we divide the option maturity into an ever-greater number of subintervals, each node of the event tree corresponds to a smaller and smaller time interval. The possible stock price movement within each time interval is correspondingly small. As those many intervals pass, the end-of-period stock price more and more closely

We pointed out earlier that the binomial model valuation approach is arbitrage-based. We can value the option by replicating its payoff with shares of stock plus borrowing. The ability to replicate the option means that its price relative to the stock and the interest rate must be based only on the technology of replication and not on risk preferences. It cannot depend on risk aversion or the capital asset pricing model or any other model of equilibrium risk-return relationships.

This insight—that the pricing model must be independent of risk aversion—leads to a very useful shortcut to valuing options. Imagine a risk-neutral economy, that is, an economy in which all investors are risk-neutral. This hypothetical economy must value options the same as our real one because risk aversion cannot affect the valuation formula.

In a risk-neutral economy, investors would not demand risk premiums and would therefore value all assets by discounting expected payoffs at the risk-free rate of interest. Therefore, a security such as a call option would be valued by discounting its expected cash flow at the risk-free rate:  $C = \frac{E'(CF)}{1 + r_f}$ . We put the expectation operator  $E$  in quotation marks to signify that this is not the true expectation, but the expectation that would prevail in the hypothetical risk-neutral economy. To be consistent, we must calculate this expected cash flow using the rate of return the stock would have in that risk-neutral economy, not using its true rate of return. But if we successfully maintain consistency, the value derived for the hypothetical economy should match the one in our own.

How do we compute the expected cash flow from the option in the risk-neutral economy? Because there are no risk premiums, the stock's expected rate of return must equal the risk-free rate. Call  $p$  the probability that the stock price increases. Then  $p$  must be chosen to equate the expected rate of increase of the stock price to the risk-free rate (we ignore dividends here):

$$
“ E ” (S _ {1}) = p (u S) + (1 - p) d S = (1 + r _ {f}) S
$$

This implies that  $p = \frac{1 + r_f - d}{u - d}$ . We call  $p$  a risk-neutral probability to distinguish it from the true, or "objective," probability. To illustrate, in our two-state example at the beginning of Section 21.3, we had  $u = 1.2$ ,  $d = .9$ , and  $r_f = .10$ . Given these values,  $p = \frac{1 + .10 - .9}{1.2 - .9} = \frac{2}{3}$ .

Now let's see what happens if we use the discounted cash flow formula to value the option in the risk-neutral economy. We continue to use the two-state example from Section 21.3. We find the present value of the option payoff using the risk-neutral probability and discount at the risk-free interest rate:

$$
C = \frac {E ^ {\prime \prime} (C F)}{1 + r _ {f}} = \frac {p C _ {u} + (1 - p) C _ {d}}{1 + r _ {f}} = \frac {2 / 3 \times 1 0 + 1 / 3 \times 0}{1 . 1 0} = 6. 0 6
$$

This answer exactly matches the value we found using our no-arbitrage approach!

We repeat: This is not truly an expected discounted value.

- The numerator is not the true expected cash flow from the option because we use the risk-neutral probability,  $p$ , rather than the true probability.
- The denominator is not the proper discount rate for option cash flows because we do not account for the risk.
- In a sense, these two "errors" cancel out. But this is not just luck: We are assured to get the correct result because the no-arbitrage approach implies that risk preferences cannot affect the option value. Therefore, the value computed for the risk-neutral economy must equal the value that we obtain in our economy.

When we move to the more realistic multiperiod model, the calculations are more cumbersome, but the idea is the same. Footnote 4 shows how to relate  $p$  to any expected rate of return and volatility estimate. Simply set the expected rate of return on the stock equal to the risk-free rate, use the resulting probability to work out the expected payoff from the option, discount at the risk-free rate, and you will find the option value. These calculations are not difficult to program in Excel.

resembles a lognormal distribution. $^6$  Thus, the apparent oversimplification of the two-state model can be overcome by progressively subdividing any period into many subperiods.

At any node, one still can set up a portfolio that is perfectly hedged over the next tiny time interval. Then, at the end of that interval, on reaching the next node, a new hedge ratio can be computed and the portfolio composition could be revised to remain hedged over the coming small interval. By continuously revising the hedge position, the portfolio remains hedged and earns a riskless rate of return over each interval. This is called dynamic hedging, the continued updating of the hedge ratio as time passes. As the dynamic hedge becomes ever finer, the resulting option-valuation procedure becomes more precise. The nearby box offers further refinements on the use of the binomial model.

# Concept Check 21.6

In the table in Example 21.3,  $u$  and  $d$  both get closer to 1 ( $u$  is smaller and  $d$  is larger) as the time interval  $\Delta t$  shrinks. Why does this make sense? Does the fact that  $u$  and  $d$  are each closer to 1 mean that the total volatility of the stock over the remaining life of the option is lower?

# 21.4 Black-Scholes Option Valuation

While the binomial model is extremely flexible, a computer is needed for it to be useful in actual trading. An option-pricing formula would be far easier to use than the algorithm involved in the binomial model. It turns out that such a formula can be derived if one is willing to make just two more assumptions: that both the risk-free interest rate and stock price volatility are constant over the life of the option. In this case, as the time to expiration is divided into ever-more subperiods, the distribution of the stock price at expiration progressively approaches the lognormal distribution, as suggested by Figure 21.5. When the stock price distribution is actually lognormal, we can derive an exact option-pricing formula.

# The Black-Scholes Formula

Financial economists searched for years for a workable option-pricing model before Black and Scholes and Merton derived a formula for the value of a call option. Scholes and Merton shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Economics for their accomplishment. Now widely used by options market participants, the Black-Scholes pricing formula for a call option is

$$
C _ {0} = S _ {0} N \left(d _ {1}\right) - X e ^ {- r T} N \left(d _ {2}\right) \tag {21.1}
$$ where


$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (S _ {0} / X) + (r + \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}
$$

$$ d _ {2} = d _ {1} - \sigma \sqrt {T}
$$

and

$C_0 =$  Current call option value.

$S_0 =$  Current stock price.

$N(d) =$  The probability that a random draw from a standard normal distribution will be less than  $d$ . This equals the area under the normal curve up to  $d$ , as in the shaded area of Figure 21.6. In Excel, this function is called NORMSDIST  $(d)$  or NORM.S.DIST  $(d, \text{TRUE})$ .

$X =$  Exercise price.

$e =$  The base of the natural log function, approximately 2.71828. In Excel,  $e^x$  can be evaluated using the function  $\mathrm{EXP}(x)$ .

$r =$  Risk-free interest rate (the annualized continuously compounded rate on a safe asset with the same maturity as the expiration date of the option, which is to be distinguished from  $r_f$ , the discrete period risk-free interest rate).

$T =$  Time to expiration of option, in years.

$\ln =$  Natural logarithm function. In Excel,  $\ln (x)$  can be calculated using the built-in function  $\mathrm{LN}(x)$ .

$\sigma =$  Standard deviation of the annualized continuously compounded rate of return of the stock.

This version of the Black-Scholes formula assumes that the stock pays no dividends before option expiration.

Notice a surprising feature of Equation 21.1: The option value does not depend on the expected rate of return on the stock. In a sense, this information is already built into the formula with the inclusion of the stock price, which itself reflects the stock's risk and return characteristics.

Although the Black-Scholes formula can be intimidating, we can explain it at a somewhat intuitive level. The trick is to view the  $N(d)$  terms (loosely) as risk-adjusted probabilities that the call option will expire in the money. First, look at Equation 21.1 assuming both  $N(d)$  terms are close to 1.0, that is, when there is a very high probability the option will be exercised. Then the call option value is equal to  $S_0 - Xe^{-rT}$ , which is what we called earlier the adjusted intrinsic value,  $S_0 - \mathrm{PV}(X)$ . This makes sense; if exercise is certain, we have a claim on a stock with current value  $S_0$ , and an obligation with present value  $\mathrm{PV}(X)$ , or, with continuous compounding,  $Xe^{-rT}$ .


Now look at Equation 21.1 assuming the  $N(d)$  terms are close to zero, meaning the option almost certainly will not be exercised. Then the equation confirms that the call is worth nothing. For middle-range values of  $N(d)$  between 0 and 1, Equation 21.1 tells us that the call value can be viewed as the present value of the call's potential payoff adjusting for the probability of in-the-money expiration.

How do the  $N(d)$  terms serve as risk-adjusted probabilities? This question quickly leads us into advanced statistics. Notice, however, that  $\ln(S_0 / X)$ , which appears in the numerator of  $d_1$  and  $d_2$ , is approximately the percentage amount by which the option is currently in or out of the money. For example, if  $S_0 = 105$  and  $X = 100$ , the option is  $5\%$  in the money, and  $\ln(105 / 100) = .049$ . Similarly, if  $S_0 = 95$ , the option is  $5\%$  out of the money, and  $\ln(95 / 100) = -.051$ . The denominator,  $\sigma \sqrt{T}$ , adjusts the amount by which the option is in or out of the money for the volatility of the stock price over the remaining life of the option. An option in the money by a given percent is more likely to stay in the money if both stock price volatility and time to expiration are low. Therefore,  $N(d_1)$  and  $N(d_2)$  increase with the probability that the option will expire in the money.

# Example 21.4 Black-Scholes Valuation

You can use the Black-Scholes formula fairly easily. Suppose you want to value a call option under the following circumstances:

Stock price:  $S_0 = 100$

Exercise price:  $X = 95$

Interest rate:  $r = .10$  (10\% per year)

Time to expiration:  $T = .25$  (3 months or one-quarter of a year)

Standard deviation:  $\sigma = .50$  (50\% per year)

First calculate

$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (1 0 0 / 9 5) + (. 1 0 + . 5 ^ {2} / 2) . 2 5}{. 5 \sqrt {. 2 5}} = . 4 3
$$

$$ d _ {2} = . 4 3 -. 5 \sqrt {. 2 5} = . 1 8
$$

Next find  $N(d_{1})$  and  $N(d_{2})$ . The values of the normal distribution are tabulated and may be found in many statistics textbooks. A table of  $N(d)$  is provided here as Table 21.2. The normal distribution function,  $N(d)$ , is also provided in any spreadsheet program. In Microsoft Excel, for example, the function name is NORMSDIST or NORM.S.DIST. Using either Excel or Table 21.2, we find that

$$
N (. 4 3) = . 6 6 6 4
$$

$$
N (. 1 8) = . 5 7 1 4
$$

Thus, the value of the call option is

$$
\begin{array}{l} C _ {0} = 1 0 0 \times . 6 6 6 4 - 9 5 e ^ {-. 1 0 \times . 2 5} \times . 5 7 1 4 \\ = 6 6. 6 4 - 5 2. 9 4 = \$ 1 3. 7 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

# Concept Check 21.7

Recalculate the value of the call option in Example 21.4 using a standard deviation of .6 instead of .5. Confirm that the option is worth more using the higher stock-return volatility.

What if the option price in Example 21.4 were  \$15 rather than\$ 13.70? Is the option mispriced? Maybe, but before betting your fortune on that, you may want to reconsider the valuation analysis. First, like all models, the Black-Scholes formula is based on some simplifying abstractions that make the formula only approximately valid.

Cumulative normal distribution

Table 21.2

Some of the important assumptions underlying the formula are the following:

1. The stock will pay no dividends until after the option expiration date.
2. Both the interest rate,  $r$ , and variance rate,  $\sigma^2$ , of the stock are constant (or in slightly more general versions of the formula, both are known functions of time, so any changes are perfectly predictable).
3. Stock prices are continuous, meaning that sudden extreme jumps such as those in the aftermath of an announcement of a takeover attempt are ruled out.

Variants of the Black-Scholes formula have been developed to deal with many of these limitations.

Second, even within the context of the Black-Scholes model, you must be sure of the accuracy of the parameters used in the formula. Four of these— $S_0$ ,  $X$ ,  $T$ , and  $r$ —are straightforward. The stock price, exercise price, and time to expiration are readily determined. The interest rate used is the money market rate for a maturity equal to that of the option, and the dividend payout is reasonably predictable, at least over short horizons.

The last input, though, the standard deviation of the stock return, is not directly observable. It must be estimated from historical data, from scenario analysis, or from the prices of other options, as we will describe momentarily.

We saw in Chapter 5 that the historical variance of stock market returns can be calculated from  $n$  observations as follows:

$$
\sigma^ {2} = \frac {n}{n - 1} \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {\left(r _ {t} - \bar {r}\right) ^ {2}}{n}
$$ where  $\overline{r}$  is the average return over the sample period. The rate of return on day  $t$  is defined to be consistent with continuous compounding as  $r_t = \ln (S_t / S_{t - 1})$ . [We note again that the natural logarithm of a ratio is approximately the percentage difference between the numerator and denominator so that  $\ln (S_t / S_{t - 1})$  is a measure of the rate of return of the stock from time  $t - 1$  to time  $t$ .] Historical variance commonly is computed using daily returns over periods of several months. Because the volatility of stock returns must be estimated, however, it is always possible that discrepancies between an option price and its Black-Scholes value simply reflect error in the estimation of the stock's volatility.


# Implied Volatility

In fact, market participants often give the option-valuation problem a different twist. Rather than calculating a Black-Scholes value for a given standard deviation, they ask instead: What standard deviation would be necessary for the option price that I observe to be consistent with the Black-Scholes formula? This is called the implied volatility of the option, the volatility level for the stock implied by the option price. Investors can then judge whether they think the actual stock standard deviation exceeds the implied volatility. If it does, the option is considered a good buy; if actual volatility seems greater than the implied volatility, its fair price would exceed the observed price.

Another variation is to compare two options on the same stock with equal expiration dates but different exercise prices. The option with the higher implied volatility would be considered relatively expensive because a higher standard deviation is required to justify its price. The analyst might consider buying the option with the lower implied volatility and writing the option with the higher implied volatility.

The Black-Scholes valuation formula, as well as the implied volatility, is easily calculated using an Excel spreadsheet like Spreadsheet 21.1. The model inputs are provided in column B, and the outputs are given in column E. The formulas for  $d_{1}$  and  $d_{2}$  are provided in the spreadsheet, and the Excel formula NORMSDIST( $d_{1}$ ) or NORM.S.DIST( $d_{1}$ , TRUE)

is used to calculate  $N(d_{1})$ . Cell E6 contains the Black-Scholes formula. (The formula in the spreadsheet actually includes an adjustment for dividends, as described in the next section.)

To compute an implied volatility, we can use the Goal Seek command from the What-If Analysis menu (which can be found under the Data tab) in Excel. See Figure 21.7 for an illustration. Goal Seek asks us to change the value of one cell to make the value of another cell (called the target cell) equal to a specific value. For example, if we observe a call option selling for  \$7 with other inputs as given in the spreadsheet, we can use Goal Seek to change the value in cell B2 (the standard deviation of the stock) to force the option value in cell E6 equal to\$ 7. The target cell, E6, is the call price, and the spreadsheet manipulates cell B2. When you click OK, the spreadsheet finds that a standard deviation equal to .2783 is consistent with a call price of \$7; this would be the option's implied volatility at a price of \$7.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange regularly computes the implied volatility of major stock indexes. Figure 21.8 is a graph of the implied (30-day) volatility of the S&P 500 since 1990. During periods of turmoil, implied volatility can spike quickly. Notice the peaks in January 1991 (Gulf War); August 1998 (collapse of Long-Term Capital Management); September 11, 2001 (terrorist attacks in the U.S.); 2002 (build-up to invasion of Iraq); October 2008 (the financial crisis); and March 2020 (outbreak of COVID-19). Because implied volatility correlates with crisis, it is sometimes called an "investor fear gauge."

A futures contract on the implied vol utility of the S&P 500 has traded on the CBOE Futures Exchange since 2004. The payoff of the contract depends on market implied volatility at the expiration of the contract. The contract is commonly called by its ticker symbol, VIX.


Figure 21.8 reveals an awkward empirical fact. While the Black-Scholes formula is derived assuming that stock volatility is constant, the time series of implied volatilities derived from that formula is in fact far from constant. This contradiction reminds us that the Black-Scholes model (like all models) is a simplification that does not capture all aspects of real markets. In this particular context, extensions of the pricing model that allow stock volatility to evolve randomly over time would be desirable, and, in fact, many extensions of the model along these lines have been developed.[10]

The fact that volatility changes unpredictably means that it can be difficult to choose the proper volatility input to use in any option-pricing model. A considerable amount of research has been devoted to techniques to predict changes in volatility. These techniques, known as ARCH and stochastic volatility models, posit that changes in volatility are partially predictable and that by analyzing recent levels and trends in volatility, one can improve predictions of future volatility.[11]

# Concept Check 21.8

Suppose the call option in Spreadsheet 21.1 actually is selling for 8. Is its implied volatility more or less than 27.83\%? Use the spreadsheet (available in Connect) and Goal Seek to find its implied volatility at this price.

# Dividends and Call Option Valuation

We noted earlier that the Black-Scholes call option formula applies to stocks that do not pay dividends before the option expires. When dividends will be paid, we need to adjust the formula, even for European-style options. In addition, if the option is American, dividends raise the possibility of early exercise, and for most realistic dividend payout schemes, the valuation formula becomes significantly more complex.

When stocks go ex dividend, the share price declines by a discrete amount, roughly equal to the amount of the dividend. If the dividend is large enough, it will be rational for the call holder to exercise just before the stock goes ex dividend. This introduces uncertainty about the "maturity" of the call. Will it be exercised at the ex-dividend date or held until the expiration date? Variations on the Black-Scholes formula have been developed that can accommodate dividends, but the resulting valuation formulas are more complex and become rapidly more difficult as the number of possible dividend payments increases.

In one special case, the dividend adjustment takes a simple form and allows us to use a slight variant of the Black-Scholes formula. If the option is European, we can replace  $S_0$  with  $S_0$  minus the present value of the dividends to be paid before expiration. Now suppose the underlying asset pays a continuous flow of income. This might be a reasonable assumption for options on a stock index, where different stocks in the index pay dividends on different days, so that dividend income arrives more or less continuously. If the dividend yield, denoted  $\delta$ , is constant, one can show that the present value of that dividend flow accruing until the option expiration date is  $S_0(1 - e^{-\delta T})$ . In this case,  $S_0 - \mathrm{PV}(\mathrm{Div}) = S_0e^{-\delta T}$ , and we can use the Black-Scholes call option formula simply by substituting  $S_0e^{-\delta T}$  for  $S_0$ . This approach is used in Spreadsheet 21.1.

One warning about this practice, however. Even with continuous dividends, it may be rational to exercise the call option early, so strictly speaking, the modified Black-Scholes formula would apply only to European options. As a general rule, American calls on dividend-paying stocks will be worth more than European ones.

# Put Option Valuation

We have concentrated so far on call option valuation. We can derive Black-Scholes European put option values from call option values using the put-call parity theorem. To value the put, we simply calculate the value of the corresponding call option in Equation 21.1 from the Black-Scholes formula, and solve for the put option value (on a non-dividend-paying stock) as

$$
\begin{array}{l} P _ {0} = C _ {0} + \operatorname {P V} (X) - S _ {0} \\ = C _ {0} + X e ^ {- r T} - S _ {0} \\ \end{array}
$$

We calculate the present value of the exercise price using continuous compounding to be consistent with the Black-Scholes formula.

Usually, it is easier to work with a put option valuation formula directly. If we substitute the Black-Scholes formula for a call in Equation 21.2, we obtain the value of a European put option as

$$
P _ {0} = X e ^ {- r T} \left[ 1 - N \left(d _ {2}\right) \right] - S _ {0} \left[ 1 - N \left(d _ {1}\right) \right] \tag {21.3}
$$

# Example 21.5 Black-Scholes Put Valuation

Using data from Example 21.4 (C_0 = \13.70, X = \$95, S_0 = \$100, r = .10, \sigma = .50, and T = .25), Equation 21.3 implies that a European put option on that stock with identical exercise price and time to expiration is worth

$$
\$ 95 e ^ {- 1 0 \times . 2 5} (1 - . 5 7 1 4) - \$ 1 0 0 (1 -. 6 6 6 4) = \$ 6. 3 5
$$

Notice that this value is consistent with put-call parity:

$$
P _ {0} = C _ {0} + \mathrm {P V} (X) - S _ {0} = 1 3. 7 0 + 9 5 e ^ {- . 1 0 \times . 2 5} - 1 0 0 = 6. 3 5
$$

# Dividends and Put Option Valuation

Equation 21.2 and Equation 21.3 are valid for European puts on non-dividend-paying stocks. As we did for call options, if the underlying asset pays a dividend, we can find European put values by substituting  $S_0 - \mathrm{PV}(\mathrm{Div})$  for  $S_0$ . Cell E7 in Spreadsheet 21.1 allows for a continuous dividend flow with a dividend yield of  $\delta$ . In that case,  $S_0 - \mathrm{PV}(\mathrm{Div}) = S_0e^{-\delta T}$ .

However, most stock options are American and allow early exercise. We have seen that the right to exercise puts early is valuable. This means that an American put option must be worth more than the corresponding European option. Therefore, Equation 21.2 and Equation 21.3 describe only the lower bound on the true value of the American put. However, in many applications, the approximation is very accurate.

# 21.5 Using the Black-Scholes Formula

# Hedge Ratios and the Black-Scholes Formula

In Chapter 20, we considered two investments in FinCorp stock: 100 shares or 1,000 call options. We saw that the call option position was more sensitive to swings in the stock price than the all-stock position. To analyze and manage the overall exposure to a stock price, we need to quantify these relative sensitivities. We summarize the sensitivity of option prices to the value of the underlying asset using the hedge ratio, the change in option price for a 1 increase in the stock price. A call option, therefore, has a positive hedge ratio and a put option a negative hedge ratio. The hedge ratio is commonly called the option's delta.

If you graph the option value as a function of the stock price, as in Figure 21.9, the delta is the slope of the curve evaluated at the current stock price. For example, suppose the slope of the curve at  S_0 = \120  equals .60. As the stock increases in value by  \$1 , the call increases by approximately  \$60 .

For every call option written, .60 share of stock would be needed to hedge the resulting stock price exposure. For example, if you write 10 options and hold six shares of stock, a \$1 increase in stock price will result in a gain of \$6 on the stock holdings, whereas the loss on the 10 options written will be 10 × $.60, an equivalent \$6. Total wealth is unaffected, which is what a hedged position is intended to ensure.

Black-Scholes hedge ratios are particularly easy to compute. The hedge ratio for a call is  $N(d_{1})$ , and the hedge ratio for a put is  $N(d_{1}) - 1$ . We defined  $N(d_{1})$  as part of the Black-Scholes formula in Equation 21.1. Recall that  $N(d)$  stands for the area under the standard normal curve up to  $d$ . Therefore, the call option hedge ratio must be positive and less than 1.0, whereas the put option hedge ratio is negative, with smaller absolute value than 1.0.

Figure 21.9 Call option value and hedge ratio


Figure 21.9 also shows that the slope of the call option valuation function is less than 1.0, approaching 1.0 only as the stock price becomes much greater than the exercise price. This tells us that option values change less than one-for-one with changes in stock prices. Why should this be? Suppose an option is so far in the money that you are absolutely certain it will be exercised. In that case, every dollar increase in the stock price would increase the option value by  \$1. But if there is a chance the call option will expire out of the money, even after a moderate stock price gain, a\$ 1 increase in the stock price will not necessarily increase the ultimate payoff to the call; therefore, the call price will not respond by a full dollar.

The fact that hedge ratios are less than 1.0 does not contradict our earlier observation that options offer leverage and disproportionate sensitivity to stock price movements. Although dollar movements in option prices are less than dollar movements in the stock price, the rate of return volatility of options is still greater than stock return volatility because options sell at lower prices. In our example, with the stock selling at  \$120 and a hedge ratio of .6, an option with exercise price\$ 120 may sell for \$5. If the stock price increases to \$121, the call price would increase by only $.60, to $5.60. The percentage increase in the option value is  $.60 / \ 5.00 = 12\%$ , however, whereas the stock price increase is only  $\$  1 / \$ 120 = .83\% . The ratio of the percentage changes is  $12\% / .83\% = 14.4$ . For every  $1\%$  increase in the stock price, the option price increases by  $14.4\%$ . This ratio, the percentage change in option price per percentage change in stock price, is called the option elasticity.

The hedge ratio is an essential tool in portfolio management and control. An example will show why.

The spreadsheet below can be used to determine option values using the Black-Scholes model. The inputs are the stock price, standard deviation, expiration of the option, exercise price, risk-free rate, and dividend yield. The call option is valued using Equation 21.1, and the put is valued using Equation 21.3. For both calls and puts, the dividend-adjusted Black-Scholes formula substitutes  $\mathrm{Se}^{-\delta T}$  for  $S$ , as outlined in Section 21.4. The model also calculates the intrinsic and time value for both puts and calls.

Further, the model presents sensitivity analysis using the one-way data table. The first workbook presents the analysis of calls while the second workbook presents similar analysis for puts. You can find these spreadsheets in Connect or through your course instructor.

# Example 21.6 Hedge Ratios

Consider two portfolios, one holding 750 FinCorp calls and 200 shares of FinCorp stock and the other holding 800 shares of FinCorp. Which portfolio has greater dollar exposure to FinCorp price movements?

Each option changes in value by  $H$  dollars for each dollar change in stock price, where  $H$  stands for the hedge ratio. Thus, if  $H$  equals .6, the 750 options have the same exposure to FinCorp's stock price as .6 × 750 = 450 shares. The first portfolio has less dollar sensitivity to stock price change because the 450 share-equivalents of the options plus the 200 shares actually held are less than the 800 shares held in the second portfolio.

This is not to say, however, that the first portfolio is less risky. The first portfolio is worth less than the second, so despite its lower sensitivity in terms of dollar value, it actually has greater rate of return sensitivity.

# Concept Check 21.9

What is the elasticity of a put option currently selling for \$4 with exercise price \$120 and hedge ratio -.4 if the stock price is currently 122?

# Portfolio Insurance

In Chapter 20, we showed that protective put strategies offer a sort of insurance policy on an asset. The protective put has proven to be extremely popular with investors. Even if the asset price falls, the put conveys the right to sell the asset for the exercise price, which is a way to lock in a minimum portfolio value. With an at-the-money option  $(X = S_0)$ , the maximum possible loss is the cost of the put. The asset can be sold for  $X$ , which equals its original value, so even if the asset price falls, the investor's net loss is just the cost of the put. If the asset value increases, however, upside potential is unlimited. Figure 21.10 graphs the profit or loss on this protective put position as a function of the change in the value of the underlying asset.

While the protective put is a simple and convenient way to achieve portfolio insurance, that is, to limit the worst-case portfolio rate of return, there are practical difficulties in implementing the strategy. First, unless the investor's portfolio corresponds to a standard market index for which puts are traded, a put option on the portfolio will not be available. And if index puts are used to protect a non-indexed portfolio, tracking error can result. For example, if the portfolio falls in value while the market index rises, the put will fail to provide the intended protection. Moreover, the maturities of traded options may not match the investor's horizon. Therefore, rather than using option strategies, investors may use trading strategies that mimic the payoff to a protective put option.

Here is the general idea. Even if a put option on the desired portfolio does not exist, a theoretical option-pricing model (such as Black-Scholes) can be used to determine how that option's price would respond to the portfolio's value if it did trade. For example, if stock prices fall, the put option will increase in value. The option model quantifies this relationship. The net exposure of the (hypothetical) protective put portfolio to swings in stock prices is the sum of the exposures of the two components of the portfolio, the stock and the put.


We can create "synthetic" protective put positions by holding a quantity of stocks with the same net exposure to market swings as that hypothetical position. The key to this strategy is the option hedge ratio, or delta.

Figure 21.10 Profit on an at-the-money protective put strategy

# Example 21.7 Synthetic Protective Put Options

A portfolio is currently valued at  \$100 million. An at-the-money put option on the portfolio might have a delta of -.6, meaning the option's value swings$  . 60 for every dollar change in portfolio value, but in an opposite direction. Suppose the stock portfolio falls by 2\%. The profit on a hypothetical protective put position (if the put existed) would be as follows (in millions of dollars):

Loss on stocks  $2 \%$  of  $\$ 100 =2.00

Gain on put  $0.6 \times \$ 2.00 = 1.20$

Net loss  $= \$  0.80$

We create the synthetic option position by selling a proportion of shares equal to the put option's delta (i.e., selling  $60\%$  of the shares) and placing the proceeds in risk-free T-bills. The rationale is that because the hypothetical put option would have offset  $60\%$  of any change in the stock portfolio's value, we reduce portfolio risk directly by selling  $60\%$  of the equity and putting the proceeds into a risk-free asset. The total return on a synthetic protective put position with \$60 million in T-bills and \$40 million in equity is

Loss on stocks 2 \% of \$ 40 = \$ 0.80

Loss on bills  $= 0$

Net loss = 0.80

The synthetic and actual protective put positions have equal dollar returns. We conclude that if you sell a proportion of shares equal to the put option's delta and place the proceeds in cash equivalents, your exposure to the stock market will equal that of the desired protective put position.

Figure 21.11 Deltas change as the stock price fluctuates

The challenge with this procedure is that deltas constantly change. Figure 21.11 shows that as the stock price falls, the magnitude of the appropriate hedge ratio increases. Therefore, market declines require extra hedging, that is, additional conversion of equity into cash. This constant updating of the hedge ratio is called dynamic hedging (alternatively, delta hedging).

Dynamic hedging is one reason portfolio insurance has been said to contribute to market volatility. Market declines trigger additional sales of stock as portfolio insurers strive to increase their hedging. These additional sales are seen as reinforcing or exaggerating market downturns.

In practice, portfolio insurers often do not actually buy or sell stocks directly when they update their hedge positions. Instead, they typically minimize trading costs by buying or selling stock index futures as a substitute for sale of the stocks themselves. As you will see in Chapter 22, stock prices and index futures prices usually are very tightly linked by cross-market arbitrageurs so that futures transactions can be used as reliable proxies for stock transactions. Instead of selling equities based on the put option's delta, insurers will sell an equivalent number of futures contracts.[15]


Several portfolio insurers suffered great setbacks during the market crash of October 19, 1987, when the market suffered an unprecedented 1-day loss of about  $20\%$ . The reasons for their problems illustrate the complexities of applying a seemingly straightforward hedging concept.

1. Market volatility at the crash was much greater than ever encountered before. Put option deltas based on historical volatility estimates were too low; insurers underhedged, held too much equity, and suffered excessive losses.
2. Prices moved so fast that insurers could not keep up with the necessary rebalancing. They were "chasing deltas" that kept getting away from them. The stock market also saw a "gap" opening, where the opening price was nearly  $10\%$  below the previous day's close. Prices dropped before insurers could update their hedge ratios.
3. Execution problems were severe. First, current market prices were unavailable, with trade execution and the price quotation system hours behind, which made computation of correct hedge ratios impossible. Moreover, trading in stocks ceased during some periods. The ability to continuously rebalance that is essential for a viable insurance program vanished.
4. Futures prices traded at steep discounts to their proper levels compared to reported stock prices, thereby making the sale of futures (as a proxy for equity sales) seem expensive. Although you will see in Chapter 22 that stock index futures prices should have exceeded the value of the stock index on October 19, Figure 21.12 shows that futures sold far below the stock index level on that day. When some insurers gambled that the futures price would recover to its expected premium over the stock index and chose to defer sales, they remained underhedged. As the market fell farther, their portfolios experienced substantial losses.

Although the portfolio insurance industry has never recovered from the market crash, delta hedging is still alive and well on Wall Street. Dynamic hedges are widely used by large firms to hedge potential losses from options positions. For example, when Microsoft ended its employee stock option program in 2003, its investment banker J.P. Morgan purchased many already-issued options of Microsoft employees, and it was widely expected that Morgan would protect its options position by selling shares in Microsoft using a delta hedging strategy.[16]

# Option Pricing and the Financial Crisis

Merton shows how option pricing models can provide insight into the financial crisis of 2008-2009. The key to his argument is to recall that when banks lend to or buy the debt of firms with limited liability, they implicitly write a put option to the borrower (see Chapter 20, Section 20.5). If the borrower has sufficient assets to pay off the loan when it comes due, it will do so, and the lender will be fully repaid. But if the borrower has insufficient assets, it can declare bankruptcy and discharge its obligations by transferring ownership of the firm to its creditors. The borrower's ability to satisfy the loan in this way is equivalent to the right to "sell" itself to the creditor for the face value of the loan. This arrangement is therefore just like a put option on the firm with exercise price equal to the stipulated loan repayment.

Consider the payoff to the lender at loan maturity (time  $T$ ) as a function of the value of the borrowing firm,  $V_{T}$ , when the loan, with face value  $L$ , comes due. If  $V_{T} \geq L$ , the lender is paid off in full. But if  $V_{T} < L$ , the lender gets the firm, which is worth less than the promised payment  $L$ .

We can write the payoff in a way that emphasizes the implicit put option:

$$
\text {p a y o f f} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} L \\ V _ {T} \end{array} \right. = L - \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} 0 & \text {i f} V _ {T} \geq L \\ L - V _ {T} & \text {i f} V _ {T} <   L \end{array} \right. \tag {21.4}
$$

Equation 21.4 shows that the payoff on the loan equals  $L$  minus the payoff of a put option on the value of the firm  $(V_T)$  with an exercise price of  $L$ . Therefore, we may view risky lending as a combination of safe lending, with a guaranteed payoff of  $L$ , combined with a short position in a put option on the borrower.

When firms sell credit default swaps (see Chapter 14, Section 14.5), the implicit put option is even clearer. Here, the CDS seller agrees to make up any losses due to the insolvency of a bond issuer. If the issuer goes bankrupt, leaving assets of only  $V_{T}$  for the creditors, the CDS seller is obligated to make up the difference,  $L - V_{T}$ . This is in essence a pure put option.

Now think about the exposure of these implicit put writers to changes in the financial health of the underlying firm. The value of a put option on  $V_{T}$  appears in Figure 21.13. When the firm is financially strong (i.e.,  $V$  is far greater than  $L$ ), the slope of the curve is nearly zero, implying little exposure of the implicit put writer (either the bank or the

CDS writer) to the value of the borrowing firm. For example, when firm value is 1.75 times the value of the debt, the light line drawn tangent to the put value curve has a slope of only -.040. But if there is a big shock to the economy, and firm value falls, not only does the value of the implicit put rise, but its slope is now steeper (see the steep, dark tangent line), implying much greater exposure to further shocks. For example, when firm value is only  $75\%$  of the value of the loan, the slope of the line tangent to the put value valuation curve is far steeper, -.644. You can see how as you get closer to the edge of the cliff, it gets easier and easier to slide right off.

We often hear people say that a shock to asset values of the magnitude of the financial crisis was a 10-sigma event, by which they mean that such an event was so extreme that it would be 10 standard deviations away from an expected outcome, making it virtually inconceivable. But Figure 21.13 shows that standard deviation may be a moving target, increasing dramatically as the firm weakens. As the economy falters and put options go further into the money, their sensitivity to further shocks increases, increasing the risk that even worse losses may be around the corner. The built-in instability of risk exposures makes a scenario like the crisis more plausible and should give us pause when we discount an extreme scenario as "almost impossible."

# Option Pricing and Portfolio Theory

We've just seen that the option pricing model predicts that security risk characteristics can be unstable. For example, as the firm weakens, the risk of its debt can quickly accelerate. So, too, can equity risk change dramatically as the firm's financial condition deteriorates. We know from the last chapter (Section 20.5) that equity in a levered firm is like a call option on the value of the firm. If firm value exceeds the value of the firm's maturing debt, the firm can choose to pay off the debt, retaining the difference between firm value and the face value of its debt. If not, the firm can default on the loan, turning the firm over to its creditors, and the equityholders get nothing. In this sense, equity is a call option, and the firm's total value is the underlying asset.

Earlier in this section, we saw that the elasticity of an option measures the sensitivity of its rate of return to the rate of return on the underlying asset. For example, if a call option's elasticity is 5, its rate of return will swing five times as widely as the rate of return on the underlying asset. This would imply that both the option's beta and its standard deviation are five times the beta and standard deviation of the underlying asset.

Therefore, when compiling the "input list" for creating an efficient portfolio, we may wish to think of equity as an implicit call option and compute its elasticity with respect to the total value of the firm. For example, if the covariance of the firm's assets with other securities is stable, then we can use elasticity to find the covariance of the firm's equity with those securities. This will allow us to calculate beta and standard deviation.

Figure 21.14 Call option elasticity as a function of stock price (Parameters:  $\sigma = .25$ ,  $T = .5$ ,  $r = .06$ ,  $X = 100$ )


Unfortunately, elasticity can itself be a moving target. As the firm gets weaker, its elasticity will increase, potentially very quickly. Figure 21.14 uses the Black-Scholes model to plot call option elasticity as a function of the value of the underlying stock. Notice that as the firm gets closer to insolvency (the value of firm assets falls below the face value of debt), equity elasticity shoots up, and even small changes in financial condition can lead to major changes in risk. Elasticity is far more stable (and closer to 1) when the firm is healthy (i.e., when the implicit call option is deep in the money). Therefore, equity risk characteristics will be far more stable for healthy firms than for precarious ones.


# Hedging Bets on Mispriced Options

Suppose you believe that the standard deviation of FinCorp stock returns will be  $35\%$  over the next few weeks, but FinCorp put options are selling at a price consistent with a volatility of  $33\%$ . Because the put's implied volatility is less than your forecast of the stock volatility, you believe the option is underpriced. Using your assessment of volatility in an option-pricing model like the Black-Scholes formula, you would estimate that the fair price for the puts exceeds the actual price.

Does this mean that you ought to buy put options? Perhaps, but by doing so, you risk losses if FinCorp stock performs well, even if you are correct about the volatility. You would like to separate your bet on volatility from the "attached" bet inherent in purchasing a put that FinCorp's stock price will fall. In other words, you would like to speculate on the option mispricing by purchasing the put option, but hedge the resulting exposure to the performance of FinCorp stock.

The option delta is the hedge ratio that can be used for this purpose. Delta is the slope of the option pricing curve:

$$
\text {D e l t a} = \frac {\text {C h a n g e i n v a l u e o f o p t i o n}}{\text {C h a n g e i n v a l u e o f s t o c k}} \tag {21.5}
$$

It tells us precisely how many shares of stock we must hold to offset our exposure to FinCorp. For example, if the put's delta is -.6, then it will fall by $.60 for every one-dollar increase in the stock price, and we need to hold .6 share of stock to hedge each put. If we purchase 10 option contracts, each for 100 shares, we would need to buy 600 shares of stock. If the stock price rises by \$1, each put option will decrease in value by $.60, resulting in a loss of  \$600. However, the loss on the puts will be offset by a gain on the stock holdings of1 per share × 600 shares.


To see how the profits on this strategy might develop, let's use the following example.

# Example 21.8 Speculating on Mispriced Options

Suppose option expiration T is 60 days; put price P = \$4.495; exercise price X = \$90; stock price S = \$90; and the risk-free rate r = 4\%. We assume that the stock will not pay a dividend in the next 60 days. Given these data, the implied volatility on the option is 33\%, as we pos- ited. However, you believe the true volatility is 35\%, implying that the fair put price is \$4.785. Therefore, if the market assessment of volatility is revised to the value you believe is correct, your profit will be 29 per put purchased.

Recall that the hedge ratio, or delta, of a put option equals  $N(d_1) - 1$ , where  $N(\cdot)$  is the cumulative normal distribution function and

$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (S / X) + (r + \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}
$$

Using your estimate of  $\sigma = .35$ , you find the hedge ratio,  $N(d_{1}) - 1 = -.453$ .

Suppose, therefore, that you purchase 10 option contracts (1,000 puts) and purchase 453 shares of stock. Once the market "catches up" to your presumably better volatility estimate, the put options purchased will increase in value. If the market assessment of volatility changes as soon as you purchase the options, your profits should equal  \$1,000 \times \ .29 = \$ 290. The option price will be affected as well by any change in the stock price, but this part of your exposure will be eliminated if the hedge ratio is chosen properly. Your profit should be based solely on the effect of the change in the implied volatility of the put, with the impact of the stock price hedged away.

Table 21.3 illustrates your profits as a function of the stock price assuming that the put price changes to reflect your estimate of volatility. Panel B shows that the put option alone can provide profits or losses depending on whether the stock price falls or rises. We see in Panel C, however, that each hedged put option provides profits nearly equal to the original mispricing, regardless of the change in the stock price.

# Concept Check 21.10

Suppose you bet on volatility by purchasing calls instead of puts. How would you hedge your exposure to stock-price fluctuations? What is the hedge ratio?

Notice in Example 21.8 that the profit is not exactly independent of the stock price. This is because as the stock price changes, so do the deltas used to calculate the hedge ratio. The hedge ratio in principle would need to be continually adjusted as deltas evolve. The sensitivity of the delta to the stock price is called the gamma of the option. Option gammas are analogous to bond convexity. In both cases, the curvature of the value function means that hedge ratios or durations change with market conditions, making rebalancing a necessary part of hedging strategies.

A variant of the strategy in Example 21.8 involves cross-option speculation. Suppose you observe a 45-day expiration call option on FinCorp with strike price 95 selling at a price consistent with a volatility of  $\sigma = 33\%$  while another 45-day call with strike price 90 has an implied volatility of only  $27\%$ . Because the underlying asset and expiration date are identical, you conclude that the call with the higher implied volatility is relatively overpriced. To exploit the mispricing, you might buy the cheap calls (with strike price 90 and implied volatility of  $27\%$ ) and write the expensive calls (with strike price 95 and implied volatility  $33\%$ ). If the risk-free rate is  $4\%$  and FinCorp is selling at  \$90 per share, the calls purchased will be priced at\$ 3.6202 and the calls written will be priced at 2.3735.

Despite the fact that you are long one call and short another, your exposure to FinCorp stock-price uncertainty is not hedged. This is because calls with different strike prices have different sensitivities to the price of the underlying asset. The lower-strike-price call has a higher delta and therefore greater exposure to the stock price. If you take an equal number of positions in these two options, you will inadvertently establish a bullish position in FinCorp, as the calls you purchase have higher deltas than the calls you write. In fact, you may recall from Chapter 20 that this portfolio (long call with low exercise price and short call with high exercise price) is called a bullish spread.

To establish a hedged position, we can use the hedge ratio approach as follows. Consider the 95-strike-price options you write as the asset that hedges your exposure to the 90-strike-price options you purchase. Then the hedge ratio is

$$
\begin{array}{l} H = \frac {\text {C h a n g e i n v a l u e o f 9 0 - s t r i k e - p r i c e c a l l f o r $ 1 c h a n g e i n F i n C o r p}}{\text {C h a n g e i n v a l u e o f 9 5 - s t r i k e - p r i c e c a l l f o r $ 1 c h a n g e i n F i n C o r p}} \\ = \frac {\text {D e l t a o f 9 0 - s t r i k e - p r i c e c a l l}}{\text {D e l t a o f 9 5 - s t r i k e - p r i c e c a l l}} > 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

You need to write more than one call with the higher strike price to hedge the purchase of each call with the lower strike price. Because the prices of higher-strike-price calls are less sensitive to FinCorp prices, more of them are required to offset the exposure.

Suppose the true annual volatility of the stock is midway between the two implied volatilities, so  $\sigma = 30\%$ . We know that the delta of a call option is  $N(d_{1})$ . Therefore, the deltas of the two options and the hedge ratio are computed as follows:

Option with strike price 90:

$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (9 0 / 9 0) + (. 0 4 + . 3 0 ^ {2} / 2) \times 4 5 / 3 6 5}{. 3 0 \sqrt {4 5 / 3 6 5}} = . 0 9 9 5
$$

$$
N (d _ {1}) = . 5 3 9 6
$$

Option with strike price 95:

$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (9 0 / 9 5) + (. 0 4 + . 3 0 ^ {2} / 2) \times 4 5 / 3 6 5}{. 3 0 \sqrt {4 5 / 3 6 5}} = -. 4 1 3 8
$$

$$
N (d _ {1}) = . 3 3 9 5
$$

Hedge ratio:

$$
\frac {. 5 3 9 6}{. 3 3 9 5} = 1. 5 8 9
$$

Therefore, for every 1,000 call options purchased with strike price 90, we need to write 1,589 call options with strike price 95. Following this strategy enables us to bet on the relative mispricing of the two options without taking a position on FinCorp. Panel A of Table 21.4 shows that the position will result in a cash inflow of 151.30. The premium income on the calls written exceeds the cost of the calls purchased.

When you establish a position in stocks and options that is hedged with respect to fluctuations in the price of the underlying asset, your portfolio is said to be delta neutral, meaning that the portfolio has no tendency to either increase or decrease in value when the stock price fluctuates.

Let's check that our options position is in fact delta neutral. Suppose that the implied volatilities of the two options come back into alignment just after you establish your position, so that both options are priced at implied volatilities of  $30\%$ . You expect to profit from the increase in the value of the call purchased as well as from the decrease in the value of the call written. The option prices at  $30\%$  volatility are given in Panel B of Table 21.4 and the values of your position for various stock prices are presented in Panel C. Although the profit or loss on each option is affected by the stock price, the value of the delta-neutral option portfolio is positive and essentially independent of the stock price. Moreover, we saw in Panel A that the portfolio would have been established without ever requiring a cash outlay. You would have cash inflows both when you establish the portfolio and when you liquidate it after the implied volatilities converge to  $30\%$ .

Profits on delta-neutral options portfolio

This unusual profit opportunity arises because you have identified option prices out of alignment. By exploiting the pricing discrepancy using a delta-neutral strategy, you should earn profits regardless of the price movement in FinCorp stock.

Delta-neutral hedging strategies are also subject to practical problems, the most important of which is the difficulty in assessing the proper volatility for the coming period. If the volatility estimate is incorrect, so will be the deltas, and the overall position will not be perfectly hedged.

These problems can be serious because volatility estimates are never fully reliable. First, volatility cannot be observed directly and must be estimated from past data. Second, we've seen that both historical and implied volatilities fluctuate over time. Therefore, we are always shooting at a moving target. Although delta-neutral positions are hedged against changes in the price of the underlying asset, they still are subject to volatility risk, the risk incurred from unpredictable changes in volatility.

The sensitivity of an option price to changes in volatility is called the option's vega. While delta-neutral option hedges might eliminate exposure fluctuations in the value of the underlying asset, they do not eliminate volatility risk.

# 21.6 Empirical Evidence on Option Pricing

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model has been subject to an enormous number of empirical tests. The results of the studies have been positive in that the model generates option values fairly close to the actual prices at which options trade. Nevertheless, some regular empirical failures have been noted.

Figure 21.15 Implied volatility on one-month SPY put options, September 27, 2021. SPY price on that date was 443.
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/1a633560537e3572934de7adb8aa27166730033fd277de391c5f9d1a614db40c.jpg)
Source: Yahoo Finance, September 27, 2021.

The biggest problem concerns volatility. If the model were accurate, the implied volatility of all options on a particular stock with the same expiration date would be equal—after all, the underlying asset and expiration date are the same for each option, so the volatility inferred from each also ought to be the same. But in fact, when one actually plots implied volatility as a function of exercise price, the typical results appear as in Figure 21.15, for which the SPY is the underlying asset (SPY is the ticker for the ETF on the S&P 500). Implied volatility steadily falls as the exercise price rises. Clearly, the Black-Scholes model is missing something.

Rubinstein was one of the first to suggest that the problem with the model has to do with fears of a market crash like that of October 1987. The idea is that deep out-of-the-money puts would be nearly worthless if stock prices evolve smoothly (as assumed by Black-Scholes) because the probability of the stock falling by a large amount (and the put option thereby moving into the money) in a short time would be very small. But a possibility of a sudden large downward jump that could move the puts into the money, as in a market crash, would impart greater value to these options. Thus, the market might value these options as though there is a bigger chance of a large drop in the stock price than would be plausible under the Black-Scholes assumptions. The result of the higher option price is a greater implied volatility.


Interestingly, Rubinstein points out that prior to the 1987 market crash, plots of implied volatility like the one in Figure 21.15 were relatively flat, consistent with the notion that the market was then less attuned to fears of a crash. However, post-crash plots have been consistently downward sloping, exhibiting a shape often called the option smirk. When we use option-pricing models that allow for more general stock price distributions, including crash risk and random changes in volatility, they generate downward-sloping implied volatility curves similar to those shown in Figure 21.15.[19]

For an extensive discussion of these more general models, see R. L. McDonald, Derivatives Markets, 3rd ed. (Boston: Pearson Education [Addison-Wesley], 2013).

# SUMMARY

1. Option values may be viewed as the sum of intrinsic value plus time or "volatility" value. The volatility value is the right not to exercise if the stock price moves against you. Thus, the option holder cannot lose more than the cost of the option regardless of stock price performance.
2. Call options are more valuable when the exercise price is lower, when the stock price is higher, when the interest rate is higher, when the time to expiration is greater, when the stock's volatility is greater, and when dividends are lower.
3. Call options must sell for at least the stock price less the present value of the exercise price and any dividends to be paid before expiration. This implies that a call on a non-dividend-paying stock may be sold for more than the proceeds from immediate exercise. Thus, when the stock does not pay dividends until after option expiration, it will never be optimal to exercise an American call option early. In this special case, European calls are worth as much as American ones.
4. Options may be valued using a binomial pricing model that assumes the stock price can take on only two values by the end of any short time period. As the number of such periods increases, the binomial model can approximate more realistic stock price distributions. The Black-Scholes formula may be seen as a limiting case of the binomial option model as the holding period is divided into progressively smaller subperiods.
5. The Black-Scholes formula applies to options on stocks that pay no dividends. Simple dividend adjustments may be adequate to price European calls, but the proper treatment of American calls on dividend-paying stocks, where early exercise becomes an issue, requires more complex formulas.
6. It may be optimal to exercise put options early, whether or not the stock pays dividends. Therefore, American puts generally are worth more than European puts.
7. European put values can be derived from the call value and the put-call parity relationship. This technique cannot be applied to American puts for which optimal early exercise is a possibility.
8. The implied volatility of an option is the standard deviation of stock returns consistent with the option's market price. It can be backed out of an option-pricing model by finding the stock volatility that makes the model's estimate of the option's value equal to the observed price.
9. The option delta (equivalently, hedge ratio) is the slope of the option pricing curve as a function of the price of the underlying asset. Deltas are near zero for deep out-of-the-money call options and approach 1.0 for deep in-the-money calls.

10. Although call option deltas are less than 1.0, their elasticities are greater than 1.0. The rate of return on a call (as opposed to the dollar return) responds more than one-for-one with stock returns.
11. Portfolio insurance can be obtained by purchasing a protective put option on an equity position. When the appropriate put is not traded, portfolio insurance entails a dynamic hedge strategy where a number of shares equal to the desired put option's delta are sold and placed in risk-free securities.
12. The option delta is used to determine the hedge ratio for options positions. Delta-neutral portfolios are independent of price changes in the underlying asset. Even delta-neutral option portfolios are subject to volatility risk, however.
13. Empirically, implied volatilities derived from the Black-Scholes formula tend to be higher on options with lower exercise prices. This suggests that option prices reflect the possibility of a sudden dramatic decline in stock prices. Such "crashes" are inconsistent with the Black-Scholes assumptions.

SCHWESER

Use the following case in answering Problems 16 through 21: Mark Washington, CFA, is an analyst with BIC. One year ago, BIC analysts predicted that the U.S. equity market would experience a slight downturn and suggested delta-hedging the BIC portfolio. U.S. equity markets did indeed fall, but BIC's portfolio performance was disappointing, lagging its peer group by nearly  $10\%$ . Washington is reviewing the options strategy to determine why the hedged portfolio did not perform as expected.

16. Which of the following best explains a delta-neutral portfolio? The return on a delta-neutral portfolio is hedged against:

$a$  .Small price changes in the underlying asset.
$b$ . Small decreases in the volatility of the underlying asset.
$c$ . Any price change in the underlying asset.

17. After discussing the concept of a delta-neutral portfolio, Washington determines that he needs to further explain the concept of delta. He draws the value of an option as a function of the underlying stock price. In such a diagram, the option's delta is the:

$a$ . Slope in the option price diagram.
b. Curvature of the option price graph.
$c$ . Level of the option price.

18. Washington considers a put option with a delta of -.65. If the price of the underlying asset decreases by 6, what is the best estimate of the change in option price?

19. BIC owns 51,750 shares of Smith & Oates. The shares are currently priced at \$69. A call option on Smith & Oates with a strike price of \$70 is selling at 3.50 and has a delta of .69. How many call options should be written to make BIC's overall position delta-neutral? Should the calls be purchased or written?
20. Return to Problem 19. Does the number of call options that BIC must write to maintain a delta-neutral position increase or decrease if the stock price falls?
21. Which of the following statements regarding the goal of a delta-neutral portfolio is most accurate? One example of a delta-neutral portfolio is to combine a: a. Long position in a stock with a short position in call options so that the value of the portfolio does not change with changes in the value of the stock.

$b$ . Long position in a stock with a short position in a call option so that the value of the portfolio changes with changes in the value of the stock.
c. Long position in a stock with a long position in call options so that the value of the portfolio does not change with changes in the value of the stock.

22. Should the rate of return of a call option on a long-term Treasury bond be more or less sensitive to changes in interest rates than is the rate of return of the underlying bond?
23. If the stock price falls and the call price rises, then what has happened to the call option's implied volatility?
24. If the time to expiration falls and the put price rises, then what has happened to the put option's implied volatility?
25. According to the Black-Scholes formula, what will be the hedge ratio (delta) of a call option as the stock price becomes infinitely large? Explain briefly.
26. According to the Black-Scholes formula, what will be the hedge ratio (delta) of a put option for a very small exercise price?
27. The hedge ratio of an at-the-money call option on IBM is .4. The hedge ratio of an at-the-money put option is -.6. What is the hedge ratio of an at-the-money straddle position on IBM?
 28. Consider a 6-month expiration European call option with exercise price \$105. The underlying stock sells for \$100 a share and pays no dividends. The risk-free rate is 5\%. What is the implied volatility of the option if the option currently sells for 8? Use Spreadsheet 21.1 (available in Connect; link to Chapter 21 material) to answer this question.

a. Go to the Data tab of the spreadsheet and select Goal Seek from the What-If menu. The dialog box will ask you for three pieces of information. In that dialog box, you should set cell E6 to value 8 by changing cell B2. In other words, you ask the spreadsheet to find the value of standard deviation (which appears in cell B2) that forces the value of the option (in cell E6) equal to \$8. Then click OK, and you should find that the call is now worth \$8, and the entry for standard deviation has been changed to a level consistent with this value. This is the call's implied standard deviation at a price of 8.
$b$ . What happens to implied volatility if the option is selling at 9?
c. Why has implied volatility increased?
$d$ . What happens to implied volatility if the option price is unchanged at 8, but the time until option expiration is lower, say, only four months? Why?
 e. What happens to implied volatility if the option price is unchanged at \$8, but the exercise price is lower, say, only \$100? Why?
$f$ . What happens to implied volatility if the option price is unchanged at \$8, but the stock price is lower, say, only \$98? Why?

29. A collar is established by buying a share of stock for \$50, buying a 6-month put option with exercise price \$45, and writing a 6-month call option with exercise price \$55. On the basis of the volatility of the stock, you calculate that for a strike price of \$45 and expiration of six months, N(d1) = .60, whereas for the exercise price of 55, N(d1) = .35.

a. What will be the gain or loss on the collar if the stock price increases by 1?
$b$ . What happens to the delta of the portfolio if the stock price becomes very large?
c. What happens to the delta of the portfolio if the stock price becomes very small?

$b$ . What should the manager do if the stock portfolio falls by  $3\%$  on the first day of trading?

46. Suppose that call options on ExxonMobil stock with time to expiration 3 months and strike price  \$90 are selling at an implied volatility of 30\%$ . ExxonMobil stock price is 90 per share, and the risk-free rate is  $4\%$ .

a. If you believe the true volatility of the stock is  $32\%$ , would you want to buy or sell call options?

1. The board of directors of Abco Company is concerned about the downside risk of a \$100 million equity portfolio in its pension plan. The board's consultant has proposed temporarily (for 1 month) hedging the portfolio with either futures or options. Referring to the following table, the consultant states: a. "The \$100 million equity portfolio can be fully protected on the downside by selling (shorting) 20,000 futures contracts."

b. "The cost of this protection is that the portfolio's expected rate of return will be zero percent."

2. Michael Weber, CFA, is analyzing several aspects of option valuation, including the determinants of the value of an option, the characteristics of various models used to value options, and the potential for divergence of calculated option values from observed market prices.

a. What is the expected effect on the value of a call option on common stock if the volatility of the underlying stock price decreases? If the time to expiration of the option increases?
$b$ . Using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and an estimate of stock return volatility, Weber calculates the price of a 3-month call option and notices the option's calculated value is different from its market price. With respect to Weber's use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, i. Discuss why the calculated value of an out-of-the-money European option may differ from its market price.

ii. Discuss why the calculated value of an American option may differ from its market price.

3. Joel Franklin is a portfolio manager responsible for derivatives.

Calculate, using put-call parity and the information provided in the table, the European-style call option value.

c. State the effect, if any, of each of the following three variables on the value of a call option. (No calculations required.) i. An increase in short-term interest rate.

ii. An increase in stock price volatility.
iii. A decrease in time to option expiration.

4. A stock index is currently trading at 50. Paul Tripp, CFA, wants to value 2-year index options using the binomial model. In any year, the stock will either increase in value by  $20\%$  or fall in value by  $20\%$ . The annual risk-free interest rate is  $6\%$ . No dividends are paid on any of the underlying securities in the index.

$d$ . Confirm that your solutions for the values of the call and the put satisfy put-call parity.

5. Ken Webster manages an 800 million equity portfolio benchmarked to the S&P 500 index. Webster believes the market is overvalued when measured by several traditional fundamental/economic indicators. He is concerned about potential losses but recognizes that the S&P 500 index could nevertheless move above its current 3,532 level.

Webster is considering the following option collar strategy:

- Protection for the portfolio can be attained by purchasing an S&P 500 index put with a strike price of 3,520.
- The put can be approximately financed by selling one 3,600 strike-price call for every put purchased.
- Because the combined delta of the call and put positions (see following table) is greater than  $-1$  (i.e.,  $-.44 - .30 = -.74$ ), the options position will not lose more than the underlying stock portfolio will gain if the market advances.

The information in the following table describes the two options used to create the collar.

<table><tr><td>Characteristics</td><td>3,600 Call</td><td>3,520 Put</td></tr><tr><td>Option price</td><td>$68.20</td><td>$64.40</td></tr><tr><td>Option implied volatility</td><td>22\%</td><td>24\%</td></tr><tr><td>Option&#x27;s delta</td><td>0.30</td><td>-0.44</td></tr></table>

Notes:

- Ignore transaction costs.
S&P 500 historical 30-day volatility  $= 23\%$
- Time to option expiration = 30 days.

a. Describe the potential returns of the combined portfolio (the underlying portfolio plus the option collar) if after 30 days the S&P 500 index has: i. Risen approximately  $5\%$  to 3,708.

ii. Remained at 3,532 (no change).
iii. Declined by approximately  $5\%$  to 3,364.

(No calculations are necessary.) b. Discuss the effect on the hedge ratio (delta) of each option as the S&P 500 approaches the level of each of the potential outcomes listed in part (a).


c. How will the pricing of each of the following respond to an increase in stock volatility?

i. The put.

ii. The call.

# E-INVESTMENTS EXERCISES

1. Use information from finance.yahoo.com to answer the following questions.

a. What is Coke's current price?
b. Now enter the ticker "KO" (for Coca-Cola) and find Analyst Price Targets (under the Analysis tab). What is the mean 12-month target price for Coke? Based on this forecast, would at-the-money calls or puts have the higher expected profit?
c. What is the spread between the high and low target stock prices, expressed as a percentage of Coke's current stock price? How (qualitatively) should the spread be related to the price at which Coke options trade?
d. Calculate the implied volatility of the call option closest to the money with time to expiration of about three months. You can use Spreadsheet 21.1 (available in Connect) to calculate implied volatility using the Goal Seek command.
e. Now repeat the exercise for Pepsi (ticket: PEP). What would you expect to be the relationship between the high versus low target price spread and the implied volatility of the two companies? Are your expectations consistent with actual option prices?
f. Suppose you believe that the volatility of KO is going to increase from currently anticipated levels. Would its call options be overpriced or underpriced? What about its put options?
g. Could you take positions in both puts and calls on KO in such a manner as to speculate on your volatility beliefs without taking a stance on whether the stock price is going to increase or decrease? Would you buy or write each type of option?
$h$ . How would your relative positions in puts and calls be related to the delta of each option?

2. Calculating implied volatility can be difficult if you don't have a spreadsheet handy. Fortunately, many tools are available on the Web to perform the calculation; for example, www.option-price.com contains option calculators that also compute implied volatility.

Using daily price data (available from finance.yahoo.com), calculate the annualized standard deviation of the daily percentage change in a stock price. Try calculating standard deviation using historical data covering (a) 60 days, (b) 120 days, and (c) 180 days. For the same stock, use the option-price.com Web site to calculate implied volatility. The input for the risk-free rate may be found at www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates/index.html. Option price data can be retrieved from www.cboe.com (look for link to Quotes & Data).

Which sample period for calculating historical standard deviation seems most correlated with implied volatility?

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. To understand the impact of higher volatility, consider the same scenarios as for the call. The low-volatility scenario yields a lower expected payoff.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">High volatility</td><td>Stock price</td><td>$10</td><td>$20</td><td>$30</td><td>$40</td><td>\$50</td></tr><tr><td>Put payoff</td><td>$20</td><td>$10</td><td>$0</td><td>$0</td><td>\$0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Low volatility</td><td>Stock price</td><td>$20</td><td>$25</td><td>$30</td><td>$35</td><td>\$40</td></tr><tr><td>Put payoff</td><td>$10</td><td>$5</td><td>$0</td><td>$0</td><td>\$0</td></tr></table>

2. If This Variable Increases . . . The Value of a Put Option

<table><tr><td>S</td><td>Decreases</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>Increases</td></tr><tr><td>σ</td><td>Increases</td></tr><tr><td>T</td><td>Increases*</td></tr><tr><td>rf</td><td>Decreases</td></tr><tr><td>Dividend payouts</td><td>Increases</td></tr></table>

*For American puts, increase in time to expiration must increase value. One can always choose to exercise early if this is optimal; the longer expiration date simply expands the range of alternatives open to the option holder, which must make the option more valuable. For a European put, where early exercise is not allowed, longer time to expiration can have an indeterminate effect. Longer expiration increases volatility value because the final stock price is more uncertain, but it reduces the present value of the exercise price that will be received if the put is exercised. The net effect on put value can be positive or negative.

3. The parity relationship assumes that all options are held until expiration and that there are no cash flows until expiration. These assumptions are valid only in the special case of European options on non-dividend-paying stocks. If the stock pays no dividends, the American and European calls are equally valuable, whereas the American put is worth more than the European put. Therefore, although the parity theorem for European options states that

$$
P _ {0} = C _ {0} - S _ {0} + \operatorname {P V} (X)
$$ in fact,  $P_0$  will be greater than this value if the put is American.


4. Because the option now is underpriced, we want to reverse our previous strategy.

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Cash Flow in 1 Year for Each Possible
Stock Price</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Initial Cash Flow</td><td>S = 90 S = 120</td></tr><tr><td>Buy 3 options</td><td>-16.50</td><td>0 30</td></tr><tr><td>Short-sell 1 share; repay in 1 year</td><td>100</td><td>-90 -120</td></tr><tr><td>Lend 83.50 at 10\% interest rate</td><td>-83.50</td><td>91.85 91.85</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>0</td><td>1.85 1.85</td></tr></table>

The riskless cash flow in one year per option is  $1.85/3 =$ .6167, and the present value is  $.6167 / 1.10 =$ .56, precisely the amount by which the option is underpriced.

5. a.  C_u - C_d = \6.984 - 0  b.  $uS_{0} - dS_{0} = \110 - \$ 95 = \$15

c.  $6.984 / 15 = .4656$ d. Value in Next Period as Function of Stock Price


<table><tr><td>Action Today (time 0)</td><td>dS0 = $95</td><td>uS0 = $110</td></tr><tr><td>Buy 0.4656 share at price S0 = $100</td><td>$44.232</td><td>\$51.216</td></tr><tr><td>Write 1 call at price C0</td><td>0</td><td>-6.984</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>\$44.232</td><td>44.232</td></tr></table>

The portfolio must have a market value equal to the present value of 44.232.

e. $44.232/1.05 = $42.126 f. 4656 \times \100 - C_0 = \42.126\$


$$
C _ {0} = \$ 46.56 - \$ 42.126 = \$ 4.434
$$

6. When  $\Delta t$  shrinks, there should be lower possible dispersion in the stock price by the end of the subperiod because each shorter subperiod offers less time in which new information can move stock prices. However, as the time interval shrinks, there will be a correspondingly greater number of these subperiods until option expiration. Thus, total volatility over the remaining life of the option will be unaffected. In fact, take another look at Figure 21.5. There, despite the fact that  $u$  and  $d$  each gets closer to 1 as the number of subintervals increases and the length of each subinterval falls, the total volatility of the stock return until option expiration is unaffected.
7. Because  $\sigma = .6$ ,  $\sigma^2 = .36$ .

$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (1 0 0 / 9 5) + (. 1 0 + . 3 6 / 2) . 2 5}{. 6 \sqrt {. 2 5}} = . 4 0 4 3
$$

$$ d _ {2} = d _ {1} - . 6 \sqrt {. 2 5} = . 1 0 4 3
$$

Using Table 21.2 and interpolation, or from a spreadsheet function:

$$
N (d _ {1}) = . 6 5 7 0
$$

$$
N (d _ {2}) = . 5 4 1 5
$$

$$
C _ {0} = 1 0 0 \times . 6 5 7 0 - 9 5 e ^ {-. 1 0 \times . 2 5} \times . 5 4 1 5 = 1 5. 5 3
$$

8. Implied volatility exceeds .2783. Given a standard deviation of .2783, the option value is \$7. A higher volatility is needed to justify an \$8 price. Using Spreadsheet 21.1 and Goal Seek, you can confirm that implied volatility at an option price of 8 is .3138.
 9. A \$1 increase in stock price is a percentage increase of 1/122 = .82\%. The put option price will fall by (.4 × $1) = $.40, a percentage decrease of $.40/4 = 10\%. Elasticity is -10/.82 = -12.2.
10. The delta for a call option is  $N(d_1)$ , which is positive, and in this case is .547. Therefore, for every 10 option contracts purchased, you would need to short 547 shares of stock.

# Futures Markets

# 22

FUTURES AND FORWARD contracts are like options in that they specify purchase or sale of some underlying security at some future date. The key difference is that the holder of an option is not compelled to buy or sell and will not do so unless the trade is advantageous. A futures or forward contract, however, carries the obligation to go through with the agreed-upon transaction.

A forward contract is not an investment in the strict sense that funds are paid for an asset. It is only a commitment today to transact in the future. Forward arrangements are part of our study of investments, however, because they offer powerful means to hedge other investments and modify portfolio characteristics.

Forward markets for future delivery of various commodities go back at least to ancient Greece. Organized futures markets, though, are a relatively modern development, dating only to the 19th century. Futures markets replace informal forward contracts with highly standardized, exchange-traded securities.


While futures markets have their roots in agricultural products and commodities, the markets today are dominated by trading in financial futures such as those on stock indexes, interest-rate-dependent securities such as government bonds, and foreign exchange. The markets themselves also have changed, with almost all trading today taking place in electronic markets.

This chapter describes the workings of futures markets and the mechanics of trading in these markets. We show how futures contracts are useful investment vehicles for both hedgers and speculators and how the futures price relates to the spot price of an asset. We also show how futures can be used in several risk-management applications. This chapter deals with general principles of futures markets. Chapter 23 describes specific futures markets in greater detail.

# 22.1 The Futures Contract

To see how futures and forwards work and how they might be useful, consider the portfolio diversification problem facing a farmer growing a single crop, let's say wheat. The entire planting season's revenue depends critically on the volatile crop price. The farmer can't easily diversify his position because virtually his entire wealth is tied up in the crop.

The miller who must purchase wheat for processing faces a risk management problem that is the mirror image of the farmer's. It is subject to profit uncertainty because of the unpredictable cost of the wheat.

Both parties can hedge their risk by entering into a forward contract calling for the farmer to deliver the wheat when harvested at a price agreed upon now, regardless of the market price at harvest time. No money changes hands at this time. A forward contract is simply a deferred-delivery sale of some asset at a stipulated price. The contract protects both the buyer and the seller from future price fluctuations.

Futures markets formalize and standardize forward contracting. Buyers and sellers trade in a centralized futures exchange. The exchange standardizes the types of contracts that may be traded: It establishes contract size, the acceptable grade of commodity, contract delivery dates, and so forth. Although standardization eliminates much of the flexibility available in forward contracting, it offers the offsetting advantage of liquidity because many traders will concentrate on the same small set of contracts. Futures contracts also differ from forward contracts in that they call for a daily settling up of any gains or losses on the contract. By contrast, no money changes hands in forward contracts until the delivery date.

The centralized market, standardization of contracts, and depth of trading in each contract allows futures positions to be liquidated easily rather than renegotiated with the other party to the contract. Because the exchange guarantees the performance of each party, costly credit checks on other traders are not necessary. Instead, each trader posts a good-faith deposit, called the margin, to guarantee contract performance.

# The Basics of Futures Contracts

The futures contract calls for delivery of a commodity at a specified delivery or maturity date, for an agreed-upon futures price, to be paid at contract maturity. The contract specifies precise requirements for the commodity. For agricultural commodities, the exchange sets allowable grades (e.g., No. 2 hard winter wheat or No. 1 soft red wheat). The place and means of delivery of the commodity are specified as well. Delivery of agricultural commodities is made by transfer of warehouse receipts issued by approved warehouses. For financial futures, delivery may be made by wire transfer; index futures use a cash settlement procedure similar to those used for index options. Although the futures contract technically calls for delivery of an asset, delivery rarely occurs. Instead, parties to the contract much more commonly close out their positions before contract maturity, taking gains or losses in cash.

Because the futures exchange specifies all the terms of the contract, the traders need bargain only over the futures price. The trader taking the long position commits to purchasing the commodity on the delivery date. The trader who takes the short position commits to delivering the commodity. The trader in the long position is said to "buy" a contract; the short-side trader "sells" a contract. The words buy and sell are figurative only because a contract is not really bought or sold like a stock or bond; it is entered into by mutual agreement. At the time the contract is entered into, no money changes hands.

Figure 22.1 shows prices for several futures contracts as they appear in The Wall Street Journal. The boldface heading lists in each case the commodity, the exchange where the futures contract is traded, the contract size, and the pricing unit. The first agricultural contract listed is for corn, traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBT). (The CBT merged with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 2007 but still maintains a separate identity.) Each contract calls for delivery of 5,000 bushels, and prices in the entry are quoted in cents per bushel.

The next rows detail price data for contracts expiring on various dates. The settlement price for the December 2021 corn contract (a representative trading price during the last few minutes of trading) was 541.50 cents per bushel, which was 4.75 cents higher than

Figure 22.1 Futures listings

Source: The Wall Street Journal, October 2, 2021 (prices for October 1, 2021).


The long position, that is, the trader who will purchase the good, profits from price increases. Suppose that when the contract matures, the price of corn turns out to be 546.50 cents per bushel. The long side, who entered the contract at the futures price of 541.50 cents, therefore earns a profit of 5 cents per bushel. As each contract calls for delivery of 5,000 bushels, the dollar profit equals  $5,000 \times .05 = \$ 250$ per contract. Conversely, the short position loses 5 cents per bushel. The short position's loss equals the long position's gain.

To summarize, at maturity:

Profit to long  $=$  Spot price at maturity - Original futures price

Profit to short  $=$  Original futures price - Spot price at maturity where the spot price is the actual market price of the commodity at the time of the delivery.


The futures contract, therefore, is a zero-sum game, with losses and gains netting out to zero. Every long position is offset by a short position. The aggregate profits to futures trading, summing over all investors, also must be zero, as is the net exposure to changes in the commodity price. For this reason, the establishment of a futures market in a commodity should not have a major impact on prices in the spot market for that commodity.

Figure 22.2, Panel A, is a plot of the long position's profits as a function of the asset price on the maturity date. Profit is zero when the ultimate spot price,  $P_{T}$ , equals the initial futures price,  $F_{0}$ . Profit per unit of the underlying asset price rises or falls one-for-one with changes in the final spot price. Unlike the payoff of a call option, the payoff of the long futures position can be negative: This will be the case if the spot price falls below the original futures price. Unlike the holder of a call, who has an option to buy, the long futures trader cannot simply walk away from the contract. Also unlike options, there is no need to distinguish gross futures payoffs from net profits. This is because the futures contract is not purchased; it is simply a contract. The futures price adjusts to make the present value of entering into a new contract equal to zero.

The distinction between futures and options is highlighted by comparing Panel A of Figure 22.2 to the payoff and profit diagrams for an investor in a call option with exercise price  $X$ , chosen equal to the futures price  $F_{0}$  (see Panel C). The futures investor is exposed to considerable losses if the asset price falls significantly. In contrast, the investor in the call cannot lose more than the cost of the option.

Futures and forward contracts are traded on a wide variety of goods in four broad categories: agricultural commodities, metals and minerals (including energy commodities), foreign currencies, and financial futures (fixed-income securities and stock market indexes).

Table 22.1 offers a sample of the various contracts trading in 2022. While the table includes many contracts, the large and ever-changing array of markets makes this list

Table 22.1

Sample of futures contracts

If you find S&P 500 or T-bond contracts a bit dry, perhaps you'd be interested in futures contracts with payoffs that depend on the winner of the next presidential election, or the severity of the next influenza season, or the host city of the 2036 Olympics. You can now find "futures markets" in these events and many others.

For example, both Iowa Electronic Markets (www.biz.uowa.edu/iem) and the Politics page of BetFair (www.betfair.com) maintain presidential futures markets. In January 2020, you could have purchased a contract that would pay off  \$1 if Bernie Sanders had won the Democratic primary but nothing if he lost. The contract price (expressed as a percentage of face value) therefore may be viewed as the probability of a Sanders victory, at least according to the consensus view of market participants at the time. If you believed that the probability of a Sanders victory was 40\%$ , you would have been prepared to pay up to .40 for the contract. Alternatively, if you had wished to bet against him, you could have sold the contract. Similarly, you could have bet on (or against) a victory by any of the other candidates, for contracts traded on each of them.


The accompanying figure shows the contract price for most of the major candidates in early 2020. The price clearly tracks their perceived prospects. You can see Biden's price start above  $\ .80$  but fall dramatically as his early debate performance was heavily criticized. But Biden's decisive victory on Super Tuesday (March 3) shows up in his rocketing price as well as the deep dive in the prices of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. By mid-March, with all the other candidates either out of the race or widely expected to drop out, Biden's price had increased to about  $\$  .90 .

Interpreting prediction market prices as probabilities actually requires a caveat. Because the contract payoff is risky, the price of the contract may reflect a risk premium. Therefore, to be precise, these probabilities are actually risk-neutral probabilities (see Chapter 21). In practice, however, it seems unlikely that the risk premium associated with these contracts is substantial.

Outside the futures markets, a well-developed network of banks and brokers has established a forward market in foreign exchange. This forward market is not a formal exchange in the sense that the exchange specifies the terms of the traded contract. Instead, participants in this over-the-counter market may negotiate for delivery of any quantity of goods at any date, whereas in the formal futures markets contract size and delivery dates are set by the exchange. In forward arrangements, banks and brokers simply negotiate contracts for clients (or themselves) as needed. This market is huge. In London alone, the largest currency market, more than  \$3 trillion of currency trades each day. An additional\$ 1.5 trillion trades on a typical day in New York.

# 22.2 Trading Mechanics

# The Clearinghouse and Open Interest

Until about 25 years ago, most futures trades in the United States occurred among floor traders in the "trading pit" for each contract. Today, however, trading is overwhelmingly conducted through electronic networks.

Once a trade is agreed to, the clearinghouse enters the picture. Rather than having the long and short traders hold contracts with each other, the clearinghouse becomes the seller of the contract for the long position and the buyer of the contract for the short position. The clearinghouse delivers the commodity to the long position and pays for delivery from the short; consequently, its position nets to zero. This arrangement makes the clearinghouse the trading partner of each trader, both long and short. The clearinghouse, bound to perform on its side of each contract, is the only party that can be hurt by the failure of any trader to satisfy the obligations of the contract. This arrangement is necessary because a futures contract calls for future performance, which cannot be as easily guaranteed as an immediate stock transaction.

Figure 22.3, Panel A, shows what would happen in the absence of the clearinghouse. The long position would be obligated to pay the futures price to the short position, and the short position would be obligated to deliver the commodity. Panel B shows how the clear inghouse becomes an intermediary, acting as the trading partner for each side of the contract. The clearinghouse's position is neutral, as it takes a long and a short position for each transaction.


The clearinghouse makes it possible for traders to liquidate positions easily. If you are currently long and want to undo your position, you simply instruct your broker to enter the short side of a contract. This is called a reversing trade. The exchange nets out your long and short positions, reducing your net position to zero. Your zero net position eliminates the need to fulfill at maturity either the original long or reversing short position.

Open interest is the number of contracts outstanding. (Long and short positions are not counted separately, meaning that open interest can be defined either as the number of long or short contracts outstanding. The clearinghouse's position nets out to zero, and so is not counted in the computation of open interest.) When contracts begin trading, open interest is zero. As time passes, open interest increases as progressively more contracts are entered.

There are many apocryphal stories about futures traders who wake up to discover a small mountain of wheat or corn on their front lawn. But the truth is that futures contracts rarely result in actual delivery of the underlying asset. Traders establish long or short positions in contracts that will benefit from a rise or fall in the futures price but almost always close out, or reverse, those positions before the contract expires. The fraction of contracts that result in actual delivery is estimated to range from less than  $1\%$  to  $3\%$ , depending on the commodity and activity in the contract. In the unusual case of actual deliveries of commodities, they occur via regular channels of supply, most often warehouse receipts.

You can see the typical pattern of open interest in Figure 22.1. In the silver contract, for example, the October contract is approaching maturity, and open interest is small; most contracts have been reversed already. The greatest open interest is in the December contract. For other contracts, for example, crude oil, for which the nearest maturity date isn't until November, open interest is highest in the nearest contract.

# The Margin Account and Marking to Market

The total profit or loss realized by the long trader who buys a contract at time 0 and closes, or reverses, it at time  $t$  is just the change in the futures price over the period,  $F_{t} - F_{0}$ . Symmetrically, the short trader earns  $F_{0} - F_{t}$ .

The process by which profits or losses accrue to traders is called marking to market. At initial execution of a trade, each trader establishes a margin account. The margin is a security account consisting of cash or near-cash securities, such as Treasury bills, that ensures the trader is able to satisfy the obligations of the futures contract. Because both parties to a contract are exposed to losses, both must post margin. To illustrate, return to the first corn contract listed in Figure 22.1. If the initial required margin on corn, for example, is  $10\%$ , then each trader must put up \$2,707.50 per contract. This is 10\%$  of the value of the contract, \5.415 per bushel × 5,000 bushels per contract.

Because the initial margin may be satisfied by posting interest-earning securities, the requirement does not impose a significant opportunity cost of funds on the trader. The initial margin is usually set between  $5\%$  and  $15\%$  of the total value of the contract. Contracts written on assets with more volatile prices require higher margins.

On any day that futures contracts trade, futures prices may rise or fall. Instead of waiting until the maturity date for traders to realize all gains and losses, the clearinghouse requires all positions to recognize profits as they accrue. If the futures price of corn rises from  $5.415 to$ 5.435 per bushel, the clearinghouse credits the margin account of the long position for 5,000 bushels times 2 cents per bushel, or 100 per contract. Conversely, the clearinghouse takes this amount from the margin account of the short position for each contract held.

This daily settling is called **marking to market**. It means the maturity date of the contract does not govern realization of profit or loss. Instead, as futures prices change, the proceeds accrue to the trader's margin account immediately. Here is an example to illustrate the procedure.

# Example 22.1 Marking to Market

Assume the 5-day maturity futures price for silver is currently 20.10 per ounce. Suppose that over the next 5 days, the futures price evolves as follows:

<table><tr><td>Day</td><td>Futures Price</td></tr><tr><td>0 (today)</td><td>20.10</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>20.20</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>20.25</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>20.18</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>20.18</td></tr><tr><td>5 (maturity)</td><td>20.21</td></tr></table>

The daily mark-to-market settlements for each contract held by the long position will be as follows:

<table><tr><td>Day</td><td colspan="2">Profit (Loss) per Ounce × 5,000 Ounces/Contract = Daily Proceeds</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>20.20 – 20.10 = 0.10</td><td>$500</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>20.25 – 20.20 = 0.05</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>20.18 – 20.25 = -0.07</td><td>-350</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>20.18 – 20.18 = 0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>20.21 – 20.18 = 0.03</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Sum = $550</td></tr></table>

The profit on Day 1 is the increase in the futures price from the previous day, or ($20.20 – $20.10) per ounce. Because each silver contract on the Commodity Exchange (CMX) calls for purchase and delivery of 5,000 ounces, the total profit per contract is 5,000 times $.10, or \$500. On Day 3, when the futures price falls, the long position's margin account will be debited by \$350. By Day 5, the sum of all daily proceeds is \$550. This is exactly equal to 5,000 times the difference between the final futures price of \$20.21 and the original futures price of \$20.10.

Marking to market is the major way in which futures and forward contracts differ, besides contract standardization. Futures follow this pay-(or receive-)as-you-go method. Forward contracts are simply held until maturity, and no funds are transferred until that date.

# Concept Check 22.2

What must be the net inflow or outlay from marking to market for the clearinghouse?

If a trader accrues sustained losses from daily marking to market, the margin account may fall below a critical value called the maintenance margin. If the maintenance margin is breached, the trader receives a margin call, requiring that the margin account be replenished or the position be reduced to a size commensurate with the remaining funds. Margins and margin calls safeguard the position of the clearinghouse. Positions are closed out before the margin account is exhausted—the trader's losses are covered, and the clearinghouse is not put at risk.

# Example 22.2 Maintenance Margin

Suppose the maintenance margin is  $5 \%$ while the initial margin was  $10 \%$ of the value of the corn, or  $\$ 2,707.50$ . Then a margin call will go out when the original margin account has fallen in half, by about  $\$ 1,354$ . Each 1- cent decline in the corn price results in a  $\$ 50$ loss to the long position. Therefore, the futures price need only fall by just over 27 cents (or  $5 \%$ of its current value) to trigger a margin call.

# The Convergence Property

On the contract maturity date, the futures price will equal the spot price of the commodity. As a maturing contract calls for immediate delivery, the futures price on that day must equal the spot price—the cost of the commodity from the two competing sources is equalized in a competitive market. You may obtain delivery of the commodity either by purchasing it directly in the spot market or by entering the long side of a futures contract.

A commodity available from two sources (spot or futures market) must be priced identically, or else investors will rush to purchase it from the cheap source in order to sell it in the high-priced market. Such arbitrage activity could not persist without prices adjusting to eliminate the arbitrage opportunity. Therefore, the futures price and the spot price must converge at maturity. This is called the convergence property.

For an investor who establishes a long position in a contract now (time 0) and holds that position until maturity (time  $T$ ), the sum of all daily settlements will equal  $F_{T} - F_{0}$ , where  $F_{T}$  denotes the futures price at contract maturity. Because of convergence, however, the futures price at maturity,  $F_{T}$ , equals the spot price,  $P_{T}$ , so total futures profits also may be expressed as  $P_{T} - F_{0}$ . Thus, we see that profits on a futures contract held to maturity perfectly track changes in the value of the underlying asset. Moreover, the total profit on a futures contract held until maturity is the same as that on a forward contract calling for the long trader to pay  $F_{0}$  for an asset that ultimately will be worth  $P_{T}$ . For this reason, futures and forwards are often treated as nearly interchangeable.

# Cash versus Actual Delivery

Most futures contracts call for delivery of an actual commodity such as a particular grade of wheat or a specified amount of foreign currency if the contract is not reversed before maturity. For agricultural commodities, where quality of the delivered good may vary, the exchange sets quality standards as part of the futures contract. In some cases, contracts may be settled with higher- or lower-grade commodities. In these cases, a premium or discount is applied to the delivered commodity to adjust for the quality difference.

Some futures contracts call for cash settlement. An example is a stock index futures contract where the underlying asset is an index such as the Standard & Poor's 500. Delivery of every stock in the index clearly would be impractical. Hence, the contract calls for "delivery" of a cash amount equal to the value that the index attains on the maturity date of the contract. The sum of all the daily settlements from marking to market results in the long position realizing total profits or losses of  $S_{T} - F_{0}$ , where  $S_{T}$  is the value of the stock index on the maturity date  $T$  and  $F_{0}$  is the original futures price. Cash settlement closely mimics actual delivery, except the cash value of the asset rather than the asset itself is delivered.

More concretely, the widely traded E-mini S&P 500 index contract calls for delivery of  \$50 times the value of the index. Suppose that at maturity, the S&P 500 is at a level of 4,000. Instead of delivering shares of all 500 stocks included in the index, cash settlement would require the short trader to deliver\$ 50 × 4,000, or \$200,000. This provides the trader exactly the same profit as would result from directly purchasing 50 units of the index for \$200,000 and then delivering it for 50 times the original futures price.

# Regulations

Futures markets are regulated by the federal Commodities Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC sets capital requirements for member firms of the futures exchanges, authorizes trading in new contracts, and oversees maintenance of daily trading records.

The futures exchange may set limits on the amount by which futures prices may change from one day to the next. For example, if the price limit on silver contracts were set at  \$1 and silver futures close today at\$ 22.10 per ounce, then trades in silver tomorrow may vary only between  \$21.10 and\$ 23.10 per ounce. The exchanges may increase or reduce price limits in response to perceived changes in the price volatility of the underlying asset. Price limits are often eliminated as contracts approach maturity, usually in the last month of trading.

Price limits traditionally are viewed as a means to limit violent price fluctuations. This reasoning seems dubious, however. Suppose an international monetary crisis overnight drives up the spot price of silver to  \$30. No one would sell silver futures at prices for future delivery as low as\$ 22.10. Instead, the futures price would rise each day by the \$1 limit, although the quoted price would represent only an unfilled bid order—no contracts would trade at the low quoted price. After several days of limit moves of \$1 per day, the futures price would finally reach its equilibrium level, and trading would resume. This process means no one could unload a position until the price reached its equilibrium level. We conclude that price limits offer no real protection against fluctuations in equilibrium prices.

# Taxation

Because of the mark-to-market procedure, investors do not have control over the tax year in which they realize gains or losses. Instead, price changes are realized gradually, with each daily settlement. Therefore, taxes are paid at year-end on cumulated profits or losses, regardless of whether the position has been closed out. As a general rule,  $60\%$  of futures gains or losses are treated as long-term capital gains, and  $40\%$  are treated as short term.

# 22.3 Futures Markets Strategies

# Hedging and Speculation

Hedging and speculating are two polar uses of futures markets. A curator uses a futures contract to profit from movements in futures prices, a hedger to protect against price movement. A curator who believes prices will increase will take a long position for expected profits. Conversely, expected price declines call for a short position.

# Example 22.3 Speculating with Oil Futures

Suppose you believe that crude oil prices are going to increase and therefore decide to purchase crude oil futures. Each contract calls for delivery of 1,000 barrels of oil, so for every  \$1 increase in the futures price of crude, the long position gains\$ 1,000 and the short position loses that amount.

Conversely, suppose you think that prices are heading lower and therefore sell a contract. If crude oil prices do in fact fall, then you will gain  \$1,000 per contract for every\$ 1 that prices decline.

If the futures price for delivery in February is \$72 and crude oil is selling at the contract maturity date for \$73, the long side will profit by \$1,000 per contract purchased. The short side will lose an identical amount on each contract sold. On the other hand, if oil has fallen to \$71, the long side will lose, and the short side will gain, 1,000 per contract.

Why does a speculator buy a futures contract? Why not buy the underlying asset directly? One reason lies in transaction costs, which are far smaller in futures markets.

Another important reason is the leverage that futures trading provides. Recall that futures contracts require traders to post considerably less margin than the value of the asset underlying the contract. Therefore, they allow speculators to achieve much greater leverage than is available from direct trading in a commodity.

# Example 22.4 Futures and Leverage

Suppose the initial margin requirement for the oil contract is 10\%. At a current futures price of \72, and contract size of 1,000 barrels, this would require margin of. 10 \times 72 \times 1,000 = \7,200. A \1 increase in oil prices represents an increase of 1.39\%, and results in a \1,000 gain on the contract for the long position. This is a percentage gain of 13.9\% on the \7,200 posted as margin, precisely 10 times the percentage increase in the oil price. The 10-to-1 ratio of percentage changes reflects the leverage inherent in the futures position because the contract was established with an initial margin of one-tenth the value of the underlying asset.

Hedgers, by contrast, use futures to insulate themselves against price movements. A firm planning to sell oil, for example, might anticipate a period of market volatility and wish to protect its revenue against price fluctuations. To hedge the total revenue derived from the sale, the firm enters a short position in oil futures. As the following example illustrates, this locks in its total proceeds (i.e., revenue from the sale of the oil plus proceeds from its futures position).

# Example 22.5 Hedging with Oil Futures

Consider an oil distributor planning to sell 100,000 barrels of oil in February that wishes to hedge against a possible decline in oil prices. Because each contract calls for delivery of 1,000 barrels, it would sell 100 contracts that mature in February. Any decrease in prices would then generate a profit on the contracts that would offset the lower sales revenue from the oil.

To illustrate, suppose that the only three possible prices for oil in February are  $71,$ 72, and 73 per barrel. The revenue from the oil sale will be 100,000 times the price per barrel.

The profit on each contract sold will be 1,000 times any decline in the futures price. At maturity, the convergence property ensures that the final futures price will equal the spot price of oil. Therefore, the profit on the 100 contracts sold will equal  $100,000 \times (F_0 - P_T)$ , where  $P_T$  is the oil price on the delivery date and  $F_0$  is the original futures price, 72.

Now consider the firm's overall position. The total revenue in February can be computed as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="3">Oil Price in February, PT</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$71</td><td>$72</td><td>\$73</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue from oil sale: 100,000 × PT</td><td>$7,100,000</td><td>$7,200,000</td><td>\$7,300,000</td></tr><tr><td>+ Profit on futures: 100,000 × (F0 - PT)</td><td>100,000</td><td>0</td><td>-100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total proceeds</td><td>$7,200,000</td><td>$7,200,000</td><td>7,200,000</td></tr></table>

The revenue from the oil sale plus the proceeds from the contracts equals the current futures price, \$72 per barrel. The variation in the price of the oil is precisely offset by the profits or losses on the futures position. For example, if oil falls to \$71 a barrel, the short futures position generates \$100,000 profit, just enough to bring total revenues to \$7,200,000. The total is the same as if one were to arrange today to sell the oil in February at the futures price.

Figure 22.4 illustrates the nature of the hedge in Example 22.5. The upward-sloping line is the revenue from the sale of oil. The downward-sloping line is the profit on the futures contract. The horizontal line is the sum of sales revenue plus futures profits. This line is flat, as the hedged position is independent of oil prices.

Figure 22.4 Hedging revenues using futures, Example 22.5 (Futures price = 72 per barrel)

To generalize Example 22.5, note that oil will sell for  $P_T$  per barrel at the maturity of the contract. The profit per barrel on the futures will be  $F_0 - P_T$ . Therefore, total revenue is  $P_T + (F_0 - P_T) = F_0$ , which is independent of the eventual oil price.

The oil distributor in Example 22.5 engaged in a short hedge, entering a short futures position to offset risk in the sales price of a particular asset. A long hedge is the analogous hedge for someone who wishes to eliminate the risk of an uncertain purchase price. For example, a petrochemical processor planning to purchase oil may be afraid that prices might rise by the time of the purchase. As Concept Check 22.3 illustrates, the firm might buy oil futures to lock in the net purchase price at the time of the transaction.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/7dc6026888b5dc3cbb86ba0194094be3f5c3be9670f010157fd5f08401137d0b.jpg)

# Concept Check 22.3

As in Example 22.5, suppose that oil will be selling in February for 71, 72, or 73 per barrel. Consider a firm that plans to buy 100,000 barrels of oil in February. Show that if the firm buys 100 oil contracts today, its net expenditures in February will be hedged and equal to 7,200,000.

Exact futures hedging may be impossible for some goods because the necessary futures contract is not traded. For example, a portfolio manager might want to hedge the value of a diversified, actively managed portfolio for a period of time. However, futures contracts are listed only on indexed portfolios. Nevertheless, because returns on the manager's diversified portfolio will have a high correlation with returns on broad-based indexed portfolios, an effective hedge may be established by selling index futures contracts. Hedging a position using futures on another asset is called cross-hedging.

# Concept Check 22.4

What are the sources of risk to an investor who uses stock index futures to hedge an actively managed stock portfolio? How might you estimate the magnitude of that risk?

# Basis Risk and Hedging

The basis equals the spot price minus the futures price. As we have noted, on the maturity date of a contract, the basis must be zero: The convergence property implies that  $F_{T} = P_{T}$ . Before maturity, however, the futures price for later delivery may differ from the current spot price.

In Example 22.5, we discussed the case of a short hedger who manages risk by entering a short position to deliver oil in the future. If the asset and futures contract are held until maturity, the hedger bears no risk because the futures price and spot price at contract maturity must be equal: Gains and losses on the futures and the commodity position will exactly cancel. However, before maturity, the hedger bears basis risk because the futures price and spot price may not move in perfect lockstep.

Some speculators try to profit from movements in the basis. Rather than betting on the direction of the futures or spot prices per se, they bet on the changes in the difference between the two. A long spot–short futures position will profit when the basis narrows.

# Example 22.6 Speculating on the Basis

Consider an investor holding 100 ounces of gold, who is short one gold-futures contract. Suppose that gold today sells for \$1,691 an ounce, and the futures price for June delivery is \$1,696 an ounce. Therefore, the basis is currently -\$5. Tomorrow, the spot price might increase to \$1,695, while the futures price increases to \$1,699, so the basis narrows to -\$4. The investor's gains and losses are as follows:

Gain on holdings of gold (per ounce):  $1,695 -$ 1,691 = 4
Loss on gold futures position (per ounce):  $1,699 -$ 1,696 = 3

The net gain equals the narrowing of the basis, or 1 per ounce.

A related strategy is a calendar spread position, where the investor takes a long position in a futures contract of one maturity and a short position in a contract on the same commodity, but with a different maturity. Profits accrue if the difference in futures prices between the two contracts changes in the hoped-for direction, that is, if the futures price on the contract held long increases by more (or decreases by less) than the futures price on the contract held short.

# Example 22.7 Speculating on the Spread

Consider an investor who holds a September maturity contract long and a June contract short. If the September futures price increases by 5 cents while the June futures price increases by 4 cents, the net gain will be 5 cents - 4 cents, or 1 cent. Like basis strategies, spread positions aim to exploit movements in relative price structures rather than profit from movements in the general level of prices.

# 22.4 Futures Prices

# The Spot-Futures Parity Theorem

We have seen that a futures contract can be used to hedge changes in the value of the underlying asset. If the hedge is perfect, meaning that the asset-plus-futures portfolio has no risk, then the hedged position must provide a rate of return equal to the rate on other risk-free investments. Otherwise, there will be arbitrage opportunities that investors will exploit until prices are brought back into line. This insight allows us to derive the theoretical relationship between a futures price and the price of its underlying asset.

Suppose for simplicity that a stock market index such as the S&P 500 currently is at 1,000 and an investor who holds  \$1,000 in an indexed mutual fund wishes to temporarily hedge exposure to market risk. Assume that the indexed portfolio pays year-end dividends of\$ 20. Finally, assume that the futures price for year-end delivery of the index is 1,010.4 Let's examine the end-of-year proceeds for various values of the stock index if the investor hedges the portfolio by entering the short side of the futures contract.

<table><tr><td>Final value of stock portfolio, ST</td><td>$ 970</td><td>$ 990</td><td>$1,010</td><td>$1,030</td><td>$1,050</td><td>$1,070</td></tr><tr><td>Payoff from short futures position(equals F0 - FT = \$1,010 - ST)</td><td>40</td><td>20</td><td>0</td><td>-20</td><td>-40</td><td>-60</td></tr><tr><td>Dividend income</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>$1,030</td><td>$1,030</td><td>$1,030</td><td>$1,030</td><td>\$1,030</td><td>1,030</td></tr></table>

The payoff from the short futures position equals the difference between the original futures price, 1,010, and the year-end stock price. This is because of convergence: The futures price at contract maturity will equal the stock price at that time.

The overall position is perfectly hedged. Any increase in the value of the indexed stock portfolio is offset by an equal decrease in the payoff of the short futures position, resulting in a final value that is independent of the stock price. The 1,030 total payoff is the sum of the current futures price, F_{0} = 1,010, and the 20 dividend. It is as though the investor arranged to sell the stock at year-end for the current futures price, thereby eliminating price risk and locking in total proceeds equal to the futures price plus dividends.

What rate of return is earned on this riskless position? The stock investment requires an initial outlay of  \$1,000, whereas the futures position is established without an initial cash outflow. Therefore, the\$ 1,000 portfolio grows to a year-end value of 1,030, providing a rate of return of 3\%. More generally, a total investment of S0, the current stock price, grows to a final value of F0 + D, where D is the dividend payout on the portfolio. The rate of return is therefore

$$
\text {R a t e} = \frac {(F _ {0} + D) - S _ {0}}{S _ {0}}
$$

This return is essentially riskless. We observe  $F_{0}$  at the beginning of the period when we enter the futures contract. While dividend payouts are not perfectly riskless, they are highly predictable over short periods, especially for diversified portfolios. Any uncertainty is extremely small compared to the uncertainty in stock prices.

Presumably,  $3\%$  must be the rate of return available on other riskless investments. If not, then investors would face two competing risk-free strategies with different rates of return, a situation that could not last. Therefore, we conclude that

$$
\frac {(F _ {0} + D) - S _ {0}}{S _ {0}} = r _ {f}
$$

Rearranging, we find that the futures price must be

$$
F _ {0} = S _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f}\right) - D = S _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f} - d\right) \tag {22.1}
$$ where  $d$  is the dividend yield on the indexed stock portfolio, defined as  $D / S_0$ . This result is called the spot-futures parity theorem. It gives the normal or theoretically correct relationship between spot and futures prices. Here is an example.


# Example 22.8 Spot-Futures Parity

Suppose the S&P 500 index is currently at  $S_0 = \$ 4,000 $and the S&P indexed portfolio is expected to pay an annual dividend yield of 2\%$ , or D = \$80\$. If the risk-free interest rate is  $1\%$ , a one-year maturity contract should have a futures price of

$$
F _ {0} = S _ {0} (1 + r _ {f} - d) = 4, 0 0 0 (1 + . 0 1 -. 0 2) = 3, 9 6 0
$$ or,equivalently,


$$
F _ {0} = S _ {0} (1 + r _ {f}) - D = 4, 0 0 0 (1 + . 0 1) - 8 0 = 3, 9 6 0
$$

Any deviation from parity gives rise to risk-free arbitrage opportunities. Example 22.9 illustrates how to exploit violations of the parity relation.

# Example 22.9 Futures Market Arbitrage

Suppose the one-year maturity futures price were  \$3,965 rather than the "appropriate" value of\$ 3,960 that we found in Example 22.8. The arbitrage portfolio entails a long position in the relatively underpriced index and a short position in the relatively overpriced futures contract with borrowing used to pay for the stock purchase.

<table><tr><td>Action</td><td>Initial
Cash Flow</td><td>Cash Flow in
1 Year</td></tr><tr><td>Borrow \$4,000; repay with interest at year-end</td><td>+$4,000</td><td>-$4,000 × 1.01 = -\$4,040</td></tr><tr><td>Buy stock index for $4,000</td><td>-$4,000</td><td>ST+ \$80 dividend</td></tr><tr><td>Enter short futures position (FO = $3,965)</td><td>0</td><td>$3,965 - ST</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>\$ 0</td><td>5</td></tr></table>

The net initial investment of this strategy is zero. Moreover, its cash flow in one year is positive and riskless: The total payoff will be  \$5 regardless of the value of the S&P 500. The profit is precisely equal to the mispricing of the futures contract,\$ 3,965 rather than 3,960.

If an arbitrage opportunity like the one in Example 22.9 existed, market participants would rush to take advantage of it. The results? The stock price would be bid up, and/or the futures price offered down, until Equation 22.1 were satisfied. A similar analysis applies to the possibility that  $F_0$  is less than \$3,960. In this case, you simply reverse the strategy above to earn riskless profits. We conclude, therefore, that in a well-functioning market in which arbitrage opportunities are competed away,  $F_0 = S_0(1 + r_f) - D$ .

# Concept Check 22.5

Return to the arbitrage strategy laid out in Example 22.9. What would be the three steps of the strategy if  $F_0$  were too low, say, 3,950? Work out the cash flows of the strategy now and in one year in a table like the one in the example. Confirm that your profits equal the mispricing of the contract.

The arbitrage strategy of Example 22.9 can be represented more generally as follows:

<table><tr><td>Action</td><td>Initial Cash Flow</td><td>Cash Flow in 1 Year</td></tr><tr><td>1. Borrow S0 dollars</td><td>S0</td><td>-S0(1 + rf)</td></tr><tr><td>2. Buy stock for S0</td><td>-S0</td><td>ST+D</td></tr><tr><td>3. Enter short futures position</td><td>0</td><td>F0 - ST</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>0</td><td>F0 - So(1 + rf) + D</td></tr></table>

The initial cash flow is zero by construction: The money necessary to purchase the stock in step 2 is borrowed in step 1, and the futures position in step 3, which is used to hedge the value of the stock position, does not require an initial outlay. Moreover, the total cash flow at year-end is riskless because it involves only terms that are already known when the contract is entered into. If the final cash flow were not zero, all investors would try to cash in on the arbitrage opportunity. Ultimately, prices would change until the year-end cash flow is reduced to zero, at which point  $F_{0}$  would equal  $S_{0}(1 + r_{f}) - D$ .


The parity relationship also is called the cost-of-carry relationship because it asserts that the futures price is determined by the relative costs of buying a stock with deferred delivery in the futures market versus buying it in the spot market with immediate delivery and "carrying" it in inventory. If you buy stock now, you tie up your funds and incur a time-value-of-money cost of  $r_f$  per period. On the other hand, you receive dividend payments with a current yield of  $d$ . The net carrying cost advantage of deferring delivery of the stock is therefore  $r_f - d$  per period. This advantage must be offset by a differential between the futures price and the spot price. The price differential just offsets the cost-of-carry advantage when  $F_0 = S_0(1 + r_f - d)$ .

The parity relationship is easily generalized to multiperiod applications. We simply recognize that the difference between the futures and spot price will be larger as the maturity of the contract is longer. This reflects the longer period to which we apply the net cost of carry. For contract maturity of  $T$  periods, the parity relationship is

$$
F _ {0} = S _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f} - d\right) ^ {T} \tag {22.2}
$$

In 2021, the T-bill rate was about  $0.1\%$  and the dividend yield on the S&P 500 was around  $2.0\%$ . Therefore, with  $r_f < d$ , Equation 22.2 would predict that futures prices should be less than the spot price, and by greater amounts for longer maturities. This is exactly what we observe in the S&P listing in Figure 22.1. (Compare the settlement prices for the December 2021 versus June 2022 S&P 500 contract.)

Although dividends of individual securities may fluctuate unpredictably, the annualized dividend yield of a broad-based index such as the S&P 500 is fairly stable. The yield is seasonal, however, with regular peaks and troughs, so the dividend yield for the relevant months should be used. Figure 22.5 illustrates the yield pattern for the S&P 500. Some months, such as January or April, have consistently low yields, while others, such as May, have consistently high ones.

We have described parity in terms of stocks and stock index futures, but it should be clear that the logic applies as well to any financial futures contract. For gold futures, for example, we would simply set the dividend yield to zero. For bond contracts, we would let the coupon income on the bond play the role of dividend payments. In both cases, the parity relationship would be essentially the same as Equation 22.2.

The arbitrage strategy described above should convince you that these parity relationships are more than just theoretical results. Any violations of the parity relationship give rise to arbitrage opportunities that can provide large profits to traders. We will see in Chapter 23 that index arbitrage in the stock market is a tool to exploit violations of the parity relationship for stock index futures contracts.

# Spreads

Just as we can predict the relationship between spot and futures prices, there are similar ways to determine the proper relationships among futures prices for contracts of different maturity dates. Equation 22.2 shows that the futures price is in part determined by time to maturity. If the risk-free rate is greater than the dividend yield (i.e.,  $r_f > d$ ), then the futures price will be higher on longer-maturity contracts, and if  $r_f < d$ , longer-maturity futures prices will be lower. For futures on assets like gold, which pay no "dividend yield," we can set  $d = 0$  and conclude that  $F$  must increase as time to maturity increases.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/722b6ffe04e85fec445e1056275acb4e472fa8b194d6f84cd5b322136d9bea4f.jpg)
Figure 22.5 S&P 500 dividend yield

To be more precise about spread pricing, call  $F(T_{1})$  the current futures price for delivery at date  $T_{1}$  and  $F(T_{2})$  the futures price for delivery at date  $T_{2}$ . Let  $d$  be the dividend yield of the stock. We know from the parity Equation 22.2 that

$$
F (T _ {1}) = S _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f} - d\right) ^ {T _ {1}}
$$

$$
F (T _ {2}) = S _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f} - d\right) ^ {T _ {2}}
$$

As a result,

$$
F \left(T _ {2}\right) / F \left(T _ {1}\right) = \left(1 + r _ {f} - d\right) ^ {\left(T _ {2} - T _ {1}\right)}
$$

Therefore, the basic parity relationship for spreads is

$$
F \left(T _ {2}\right) = F \left(T _ {1}\right) \left(1 + r _ {f} - d\right) ^ {\left(T _ {2} - T _ {1}\right)} \tag {22.3}
$$

Equation 22.3 should remind you of the spot-futures parity relationship. The major difference is in the substitution of  $F(T_{1})$  for the current spot price. The intuition is also similar. Delaying delivery from  $T_{1}$  to  $T_{2}$  assures the long position that the stock will be purchased for  $F(T_{2})$  dollars at  $T_{2}$  but does not require that money be tied up in the stock until  $T_{2}$ . The savings realized are the net cost of carry between  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ . Delaying delivery from  $T_{1}$  until  $T_{2}$  frees up  $F(T_{1})$  dollars, which earn risk-free interest at  $r_{f}$ . The delayed delivery of the stock also results in the lost dividend yield between  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ . The net cost of carry saved by delaying the delivery is thus  $r_{f} - d$ . This gives the proportional increase in the futures price required to compensate market participants for the delayed delivery of the stock and postponement of the payment of the futures price. If the parity condition for spreads is violated, arbitrage opportunities will arise. (Problem 19 at the end of the chapter explores this possibility.)

# Example 22.10 Spread Pricing

To see how to use Equation 22.3, consider the following data for a hypothetical contract:

<table><tr><td>Contract Maturity Data</td><td>Futures Price</td></tr><tr><td>January 15</td><td>105.00</td></tr><tr><td>March 15</td><td>105.09</td></tr></table>

Suppose that the effective annual T-bill rate is  $3\%$  and that the dividend yield is  $2\%$  per year. The "correct" March futures price given the January price is, according to Equation 22.3,

$$
1 0 5 (1 +. 0 3 -. 0 2) ^ {2 / 1 2} = 1 0 5. 1 7
$$

The actual March futures price is 105.09, making it slightly underpriced compared to the January futures price so that, aside from transaction costs, an arbitrage opportunity seems to be present.

Equation 22.3 shows that futures prices with different maturities should all move together. This is not surprising because all are linked to the same spot price through the parity relationship. Figure 22.6 plots futures prices on gold for three maturity dates. It is apparent that the prices move in virtual lockstep and that the more distant delivery dates command higher futures prices, as Equation 22.3 predicts.

# Forward versus Futures Pricing

Until now we have paid little attention to the differing time profile of returns of futures and forward contracts. Instead, we have taken the sum of daily mark-to-market proceeds to the

Strictly speaking, our parity theorems are appropriate for forward pricing because they assume that contract proceeds are in fact realized only on delivery. In contrast, the actual timing of cash flows conceivably might affect the futures price.


Futures prices will deviate from parity when marking gives a systematic advantage to either the long or short position. If marking to market tends to favor the long position, for example, the futures price should exceed the forward price because the long position will be willing to pay a premium for that advantage.

When will marking to market favor either a long or short trader? A trader will benefit if daily settlements are received (and can be invested) when the interest rate is high; symmetrically, a trader will benefit when daily settlements are paid (and can be financed) when the interest rate is low. Because long positions will benefit if futures prices tend to rise when interest rates are high, they will be willing to accept a higher futures price if there is a positive correlation between interest rates and changes in futures prices. In this situation, the "fair" futures price will exceed the forward price. Conversely, a negative correlation means that marking to market favors the short position and implies that the equilibrium futures price should be below the forward price.

For most contracts, the covariance between futures prices and interest rates is so low that the difference between futures and forward prices will be negligible. However, contracts on long-term fixed-income securities are a notable exception to this rule. In this case, because prices have a high correlation with interest rates, the covariance can be large enough to generate a meaningful spread between forward and futures prices.

# 22.5 Futures Prices versus Expected Spot Prices

So far we have considered the relationship between futures prices and the current spot price. What about the relationship between the futures price and the expected value of the spot price? In other words, how well does the futures price forecast the ultimate spot price? Three traditional theories have been put forth: the expectations hypothesis, normal backwardation, and contango. Today's consensus is that all of these traditional hypotheses are subsumed by modern portfolio theory. Figure 22.7 shows the expected path of futures under the three traditional hypotheses.

# Expectations Hypothesis

The expectations hypothesis is the simplest theory of futures pricing. It states that the futures price equals the expected value of the future spot price:  $F_0 = E(P_T)$ . Under this theory the expected profit to either position of a futures contract would equal zero: The short position's expected profit is  $F_0 - E(P_T)$ , whereas the long's is  $E(P_T) - F_0$ . With  $F_0 = E(P_T)$ , the expected profit to either side is zero.

The expectations hypothesis resembles market equilibrium in a world with no uncertainty; that is, if prices of goods at all future dates were currently known, then the futures price for delivery at any particular date would equal the currently known future spot price for that date. It is a tempting but incorrect leap to then assert that under uncertainty the futures price should equal the currently expected spot price. This view ignores the risk premiums that must be built into futures prices when ultimate spot prices are uncertain.

# Normal Backwardation

This theory is associated with the famous British economists John Maynard Keynes and John Hicks. They argued that for most commodities there are natural hedgers who wish to shed risk. For example, wheat farmers desire to shed the risk of uncertain wheat prices. These farmers will take short positions to deliver wheat at a guaranteed price; they will short hedge. To induce speculators to take the corresponding long positions, the farmers need to offer them an expectation of profit. Speculators will enter the long side of the contract only if the futures price is below the expected spot price of wheat, providing an expected profit of  $E(P_T) - F_0$ . The speculators' expected profit is the farmers' expected loss, but farmers are willing to bear this expected loss to avoid the risk of uncertain wheat prices. The theory of normal backwardation thus suggests that the futures price will be

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/b269c3a1ca5e388a7494f041dbd004e218a3d236debbc845c4ce4167eab4afcd.jpg)
Figure 22.7 Futures price over time, in the special case that the expected spot price remains unchanged


bid down to a level below the expected spot price and will rise over the life of the contract until the maturity date, at which point  $F_{T} = P_{T}$ .

Although this theory recognizes the important role of risk premiums in futures markets, it is based on total variability rather than on systematic risk. (This is not surprising, as Keynes wrote almost 40 years before the development of modern portfolio theory.) The modern view refines the measure of risk used to determine appropriate risk premiums.

# Contango

The contango theory holds that the natural hedgers are the purchasers of a commodity, rather than the suppliers. In the case of wheat, for example, we would view grain processors as willing to pay a premium to lock in their purchase price. These processors hedge by taking a long position in the futures market; therefore, they are called long hedgers, whereas farmers are short hedgers. Because long hedgers will agree to pay high futures prices to shed risk, and because speculators must be paid a premium to enter the short position, the contango theory holds that  $F_{0}$  must exceed  $E(P_{T})$ .

It is clear that any commodity will have both natural long hedgers and short hedgers. The compromise traditional view, called the "net hedging hypothesis," is that  $F_{0}$  will be less than  $E(P_{T})$  when short hedgers outnumber long hedgers and vice versa. The strong side of the market will be the side (short or long) that has more natural hedgers. The strong side must pay a premium to induce speculators to enter into enough contracts to balance the "natural" supply of long and short hedgers.

# Modern Portfolio Theory

The three traditional hypotheses all envision a mass of speculators willing to enter either side of the futures market if they are sufficiently compensated for the risk they incur. Modern portfolio theory fine-tunes this approach by refining the notion of risk. Simply put, if commodity prices pose positive systematic risk, futures prices must be lower than expected spot prices.

To illustrate, consider once again a stock paying no dividends. If  $E(P_{T})$  denotes the expected time- $T$  stock price and  $k$  denotes the required rate of return on the stock, then the price of the stock must equal the present value of its expected future payoff:

$$
P _ {0} = \frac {E \left(P _ {T}\right)}{\left(1 + k\right) ^ {T}} \tag {22.4}
$$

We also know from the spot-futures parity relationship that

$$
P _ {0} = \frac {F _ {0}}{\left(1 + r _ {f}\right) ^ {T}} \tag {22.5}
$$

Therefore, the right-hand sides of Equations 22.4 and 22.5 must be equal. Equating these terms allows us to solve for  $F_{0}$  in terms of the expected spot price:

$$
F _ {0} = E \left(P _ {T}\right) \left(\frac {1 + r _ {f}}{1 + k}\right) ^ {T} \tag {22.6}
$$

You can see immediately from Equation 22.6 that  $F_{0}$  will be less than the expectation of  $P_{T}$  whenever  $k$  is greater than  $r_{f}$ , which will be the case for any positive-beta asset. This means that the long side of the contract will make an expected profit  $[F_{0}$  will be lower than  $E(P_{T})]$  when the commodity exhibits positive systematic risk (i.e., if  $k$  is greater than  $r_{f}$ ).

Why should this be? A long future's position will provide a profit (or loss) of  $P_T - F_0$ . If the ultimate value of  $P_T$  entails positive systematic risk, so will the profit to the long position. Speculators with well-diversified portfolios will be willing to enter long futures positions only if they receive compensation for bearing that risk in the form of positive expected profits. Their expected profits will be positive only if  $E(P_T)$  is greater than  $F_0$ . Conversely, the short position's profit is the negative of the long position's and will have negative systematic risk. Diversified investors in the short position will be willing to suffer an expected loss to reduce portfolio risk and will be willing to enter the contract even when  $F_0$  is less than  $E(P_T)$ . We conclude that if  $P_T$  has positive beta,  $F_0$  must be less than the expectation of  $P_T$ , while the analysis is reversed for negative-beta assets.

# Concept Check 22.6

What must be true of the risk of the spot price of an asset if the futures price is an unbiased estimate of the ultimate spot price?

# SUMMARY

1. Forward contracts call for future delivery of an asset at a currently agreed-on price. The long trader purchases the good, and the short trader delivers it. If the price of the asset at the maturity of the contract exceeds the forward price, the long side benefits by virtue of acquiring the good at the contract price.
2. A futures contract is similar to a forward contract, differing most importantly in the aspects of standardization and marking to market, which is the process by which gains and losses on futures contract positions are settled daily. In contrast, forward contracts call for no cash transfers until contract maturity.
3. Futures contracts are traded on organized exchanges that standardize the size of the contract, the grade of the deliverable asset, the delivery date, and the delivery location. Traders negotiate only over the contract price. This standardization increases liquidity and means that buyers and sellers can easily find many traders for a desired purchase or sale.
4. The clearinghouse steps in between each pair of traders, acting as the short position for each long and as the long position for each short. In this way traders need not be concerned about the performance of the trader on the opposite side of the contract. In turn, traders post margins to guarantee their own performance.
5. The long position's gain or loss between time 0 and time  $t$  is  $F_{t} - F_{0}$ . Because at the maturity date,  $T$ ,  $F_{T} = P_{T}$ , the long's profit if the contract is held until maturity is  $P_{T} - F_{0}$ , where  $P_{T}$  is the spot price at time  $T$  and  $F_{0}$  is the original futures price. The short position's profit is  $F_{0} - P_{T}$ .
6. Futures contracts may be used for hedging or speculating. Speculators use the contracts to take a stand on the ultimate price of an asset. Short hedgers take short positions in contracts to offset any gains or losses on the value of an asset already held in inventory. Long hedgers take long positions to offset gains or losses in the purchase price of a good.
7. The spot-futures parity relationship states that the equilibrium futures price on an asset providing no service or payments (such as dividends) is  $F_0 = P_0(1 + r_f)^T$ . If the futures price deviates from this value, then market participants can earn arbitrage profits.
8. If the asset provides services or payments with yield  $d$ , the parity relationship becomes  $F_0 = P_0(1 + r_f - d)^T$ . This model is also called the cost-of-carry model because it states that the futures price must exceed the spot price by the net cost of carrying the asset until maturity date  $T$ .
9. The equilibrium futures price will be less than the currently expected time  $T$  spot price if the spot price exhibits systematic risk. This provides an expected profit for the long position who bears the risk and imposes an expected loss on the short position who is willing to accept that expected loss as a means to shed systematic risk.

# PROBLEM SETS

13. FinTrade has just introduced a single-stock futures contract on Brandex stock, a company that currently pays no dividends. Each contract calls for delivery of 1,000 shares of stock in one year. The T-bill rate is  $6\%$  per year.

15. You are a corporate treasurer who will purchase 1 million of bonds for the sinking fund in three months. You believe rates will soon fall, and you would like to repurchase the company's sinking fund bonds (which currently are selling below par) in advance of requirements. Unfortunately, you must obtain approval from the board of directors for such a purchase, and this can take up to two months. What action can you take in the futures market to hedge any adverse movements in bond yields and prices until you can actually buy the bonds? Will you be long or short? Why? A qualitative answer is fine.

4. The risk would be that the index and the portfolio do not move perfectly together. Thus, basis risk involving the spread between the futures price and the portfolio value could persist even if the index futures price were set perfectly relative to the index itself. You can measure this risk using the index model introduced in Chapter 8. If you regress the return of the active portfolio on the return of the index portfolio, the regression  $R$ -square will equal the proportion of the variance of the active portfolio's return that could have been hedged using the index futures contract. You can also measure the risk of the imperfectly hedged position using the standard error of the regression, which tells you the standard deviation of the residuals in the index model. Because these are the components of the risky returns that are independent of the market index, this standard deviation measures the variability of the portion of the active portfolio's return that cannot be hedged using the index futures contract.


5. The futures price, \$3,950, is \$10 below the parity value of 3,960. The cash flow to the following strategy is riskless and equal to this mispricing.

# Futures, Swaps, and Risk Management

# 23

CHAPTER 22 provided an introduction to the operation of futures markets and the principles of futures pricing. This chapter explores both pricing and risk management in selected futures markets in more depth. Financial futures dominate trading, so we emphasize these contracts.

Hedging refers to techniques that offset particular sources of risk. Hedging activities therefore are more limited and more focused than more ambitious strategies seeking an optimal risk-return profile for an entire portfolio. Because futures contracts are written on specific quantities such as stock index values, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and so on, they are ideally suited for these applications. In this chapter we consider several hedging applications, illustrating general principles using a variety of contracts. We also show how hedging strategies can be used to isolate bets on perceived profit opportunities.


We begin with foreign exchange futures, showing how forward exchange rates are determined by interest rate differentials across countries and examining how firms can use futures to manage exchange rate risk. We then move on to stock-index futures, where we focus on program trading and index arbitrage. Next we turn to futures contracts written on fixed-income securities, as well as contracts written directly on interest rates. We also examine commodity futures pricing. Finally, we turn to swaps markets in foreign exchange and fixed-income securities. We will see that swaps can be interpreted as portfolios of forward contracts and valued accordingly.

# 23.1 Foreign Exchange Futures

# The Markets

Exchange rates between currencies vary continually and often substantially. This variability adds risk to international business. A U.S. exporter who sells goods in England, for example, will be paid in British pounds, and the dollar value of those pounds depends on the exchange rate at the time payment is made. This risk can be hedged through currency futures or forward markets. For example, if you know you will receive

£100,000 in 90 days, you can sell those pounds forward in the forward market to lock in an exchange rate equal to today's forward price.

The forward market in foreign exchange is fairly informal. It is a network of banks and brokers that allows customers to enter forward contracts to purchase or sell currency in the future at a currently agreed-upon rate of exchange. The bank market in currencies is among the largest in the world, and most large traders with sufficient creditworthiness execute their trades here rather than in futures markets. In forward markets, traders can negotiate to deliver any quantity of currency on any delivery date that is mutually agreeable to both sides of the contract. Moreover, there is no marking to market. Currency forward contracts call for execution only at the maturity date. Participants need to consider counterparty risk, the possibility that a trading partner may not be able to make good on its obligations under the contract if prices move against it. For this reason, traders who participate in forward markets must have solid creditworthiness.

Currency futures, in contrast, trade in formal exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (in its International Monetary Market) or the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE). Here contracts are standardized by size, and daily marking to market is observed. Moreover, standard clearing arrangements allow traders to enter or reverse positions easily. Margin positions are used to ensure contract performance, which is, in turn, guaranteed by the exchange's clearinghouse, so the identity and creditworthiness of the counterparty to a trade are not a concern.

Figure 23.1 reproduces The Wall Street Journal listing of foreign exchange rates. The listing gives the number of U.S. dollars required to purchase some unit of foreign currency, so-called direct quotes, and then the amount of foreign currency needed to purchase \$1, indirect quotes. By custom, some exchange rates (the British pound or the euro) are typically quoted using direct rates, for example, \$1.3546/£, but most currencies are quoted using indirect rates, for example, ¥111.07/$. The quotes in Figure 23.1 are spot rates (i.e., exchange rates for immediate delivery).

Figure 23.2 presents listings for currency futures contracts. The futures markets employ exclusively direct quotes. Notice that the contracts specify the size of each contract and the maturity date (there are only four maturity dates in each calendar year).

# Interest Rate Parity

As is true of stocks and stock futures, there is a spot-futures exchange rate relationship that will prevail in well-functioning markets. Should this so-called interest rate parity relationship be violated, arbitrageurs will be able to make risk-free profits in foreign exchange markets with zero net investment. Their actions will force futures and spot exchange rates back into alignment. Another term for interest rate parity is the covered interest arbitrage relationship.

We illustrate interest rate parity using two currencies, the U.S. dollar and the British (U.K.) pound. Call  $E_0$  the current direct exchange rate between the two currencies, that is,  $E_0$  dollars are required to purchase one pound.  $F_0$ , the forward price, is the number of dollars agreed to today for purchase of one pound at time  $T$ . Call the risk-free rates in the United States and United Kingdom  $r_{\mathrm{US}}$  and  $r_{\mathrm{UK}}$ , respectively.

The interest rate parity theorem states that the proper relationship between  $E_0$  and  $F_0$  is

$$
F _ {0} = E _ {0} \left(\frac {1 + r _ {\mathrm {U S}}}{1 + r _ {\mathrm {U K}}}\right) ^ {T} \tag {23.1}
$$

For example, if  r_{\mathrm{US}} = .04  and  r_{\mathrm{UK}} = .01  annually, while  E_0 = \1.30  per pound, then the proper futures price for a 1-year contract would be

Consider the intuition behind Equation 23.1. If  $r_{\mathrm{US}}$  is greater than  $r_{\mathrm{UK}}$ , money invested in the United States will grow at a faster rate than money invested in the United Kingdom. Why then don't all investors choose to invest their money in the United States? One important reason is that the dollar may be depreciating relative to the pound. Although dollar investments in the United States grow faster than pound investments in the United Kingdom, each dollar may be worth fewer pounds in the forward market than in the spot market. Such a forward discount can offset the advantage of the higher U.S. interest rate.

How does a depreciating dollar show up in Equation 23.1? If the dollar is depreciating, more dollars will be required to purchase each pound, and the forward exchange rate  $F_{0}$  (in dollars per pound) will be greater than  $E_{0}$ , the current exchange rate. This is exactly

Of course, the argument also works in reverse: If  $r_{\mathrm{US}}$  is less than  $r_{\mathrm{UK}}$ , then  $F_0$  is less than  $E_0$ .

# Example 23.1 Covered Interest Arbitrage

What if the interest rate parity relationship were violated? For example, suppose the futures price is \$1.32/£ instead of \$1.3386/£. You could adopt the following strategy. Let E₁ denote the exchange rate ($/£) that will prevail in one year. E₁ is, of course, a random variable from the perspective of today's investors.

<table><tr><td>Action</td><td>Initial Cash Flow ($)</td><td>CF in 1 Year ($)</td></tr><tr><td>1. Borrow 1 U.K. pound in London. Convert to dollars. Repay £1.01 at year-end.</td><td>1.30</td><td>-£1(£1.01)</td></tr><tr><td>2. Lend \$1.30 in the United States at the U.S. interest rate.</td><td>-1.30</td><td>\$1.30(1.04)</td></tr><tr><td>3. Enter a contract to purchase £1.01 at a (futures) price of F0 = $1.32/£.</td><td>0</td><td>£1.01(E1 - $1.32/£)</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>0</td><td>0.0188</td></tr></table>

In step 1, you exchange the one pound borrowed in the United Kingdom for 1.30 at the current exchange rate. After one year you must repay the pound borrowed with interest. Because the loan is made in the United Kingdom at the U.K. interest rate, you would repay £1.01, which would be worth E1(1.01) dollars. The U.S. loan in step 2 is made at the U.S.

interest rate of  $4 \%$ The futures position in step 3 results in receipt of £1.01, for which you would pay \$1.32 each, and then convert into dollars at exchange rate  $E _ {1}$ .

Note that the exchange rate risk here is exactly offset between the pound obligation in step 1 and the futures position in step 3. The profit from the strategy is therefore risk-free and requires no net investment.

# To generalize the strategy in Example 23.1:

<table><tr><td>Action</td><td>Initial CF ($)</td><td>CF in 1 Year ($)</td></tr><tr><td>1. Borrow 1 U.K. pound in London. Convert to dollars.</td><td>$E0</td><td>-$E1(1 + rUK)</td></tr><tr><td>2. Use proceeds of borrowing in London to lend in the U.S.</td><td>-$E0</td><td>$E0(1 + rUS)</td></tr><tr><td>3. Enter (1 + rUK) futures positions to purchase 1 pound for F0 dollars.</td><td>0</td><td>(1 + rUK)(E1 - F0)</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>0</td><td>E0(1 + rUS) - F0(1 + rUK)</td></tr></table>

The net proceeds to the arbitrage portfolio are risk-free and given by  $E_0(1 + r_{\mathrm{US}}) - F_0(1 + r_{\mathrm{UK}})$ . If this value is positive, borrow in the United Kingdom, lend in the United States, and enter a long futures position to eliminate foreign exchange risk. If the value is negative, borrow in the United States, lend in the United Kingdom, and take a short position in pound futures. When prices preclude arbitrage opportunities, the expression must equal zero. This no-arbitrage condition implies that

$$
F _ {0} = \frac {1 + r _ {\mathrm {U S}}}{1 + r _ {\mathrm {U K}}} E _ {0} \tag {23.2}
$$ which is the interest rate parity theorem for a 1-year horizon.

# Concept Check 23.1

What would be the arbitrage strategy and associated profits in Example 23.1 if the initial futures price were  F_0 = \1.35/pound ?

# Example 23.2 Covered Interest Arbitrage

Let's continue our earlier discussion for the dollar-pound exchange rate. The interest rate in the U.S. is assumed to be 4\% and the U.K. interest rate is 1\%. The spot exchange rate is E_0 = \1.30/ This implies the following pattern for forward exchange rates of various maturities:

<table><tr><td>Time horizon, T</td><td>Forward exchange rate = E0(1 + rUS/1 + rUK)T</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>$1.30(1.04/1.01)1 = $1.3386/£</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>$1.30(1.04/1.01)2 = $1.3784/£</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>$1.30(1.04/1.01)3 = $1.4193/£</td></tr></table>

We see that the dollar sells at a progressively steeper forward discount (it takes more and more dollars to buy one pound) as the maturity of the contract extends. This discount exactly offsets the higher rate at which dollar investments grow compared to pound investments.

# Direct versus Indirect Quotes

The exchange rate in Examples 23.1 and 23.2 is expressed as dollars per pound. This is an example of a direct exchange rate quote. The euro-dollar exchange rate is also typically expressed as a direct quote. In contrast, exchange rates for other currencies such as the Japanese yen or Swiss franc are typically expressed as indirect quotes, that is, as units of foreign currency per dollar, for example, 111 yen per dollar. For currencies expressed as indirect quotes, depreciation of the dollar would result in a decrease in the quoted exchange rate (1 buys fewer yen); in contrast, dollar depreciation versus the pound would show up as a higher exchange rate (more dollars are required to buy £1). When the exchange rate is quoted as foreign currency per dollar, the domestic and foreign exchange rates in Equation 23.2 must be switched: In this case, the equation becomes

$$
F _ {0} (\text {f o r e i g n c u r r e n c y / \Phi}) = \frac {1 + r _ {\text {f o r e i g n}}}{1 + r _ {\mathrm {U S}}} \times E _ {0} (\text {f o r e i g n c u r r e n c y / \Phi})
$$

If the interest rate in the U.S. is higher than in Japan, the dollar will sell in the forward market at a lower price (will buy fewer yen) than in the spot market.

# Using Futures to Manage Exchange Rate Risk

Consider a U.S. firm that exports most of its product to Great Britain. The firm is vulnerable to fluctuations in the dollar-pound exchange rate for several reasons. First, the dollar value of its pound-denominated sales will fluctuate with the exchange rate. Second, the pound price that the firm can charge its customers in the United Kingdom will itself be affected by the exchange rate. For example, if the pound depreciates by  $10\%$ , the firm would need to increase the pound price of its goods by  $10\%$  in order to maintain the dollar-equivalent price. However, the firm might not be able to raise the price by  $10\%$  if it faces competition from British producers or if it believes the higher price would reduce demand for its product.

To offset its foreign exchange exposure, the firm might engage in transactions that bring it profits when the pound depreciates. The lost profits from business operations resulting from a depreciation will then be offset by gains on its financial transactions. For example, if the firm enters a futures contract to deliver pounds for a given number of dollars, then if the pound depreciates, the futures position will yield a profit.

Suppose the futures price is currently  \$1.40 per pound for delivery in three months. If the firm enters a futures contract with a futures price of\$ 1.40 per pound and the exchange rate in three months is \$1.30 per pound, then the profit to the short position is  $F_{0} - F_{T} =$ 1.40 - $1.30 = $.10 per pound.

How many pounds should be sold in the futures market to most fully offset its exposure? Suppose the dollar value of profits in the next quarter will fall by \$200,000 for every $.10 depreciation of the pound. To hedge, we need an equal but opposite exposure: in this case, a futures position that provides 200,000 extra profit for every

 .10 that the pound depreciates. Therefore, we need a futures position to deliver 2,000,000. As we have just seen, the profit per pound on the futures contract equals the difference in the current futures price and the ultimate exchange rate; therefore, the foreign exchange profits resulting from a  .10 depreciation^{1} will equal  .10 \times 2,000,000 = \ {200},{000}  .

The proper hedge position in pound futures is independent of the actual depreciation in the pound as long as the relationship between profits and exchange rates is approximately linear. For example, if the pound depreciates by only half as much, $.05, the firm would lose only \$100,000 in operating profits. The futures position would also return half the profits: $.05 × 2,000,000 = $100,000, again just offsetting the operating exposure. If the pound appreciates, the hedge position still (unfortunately in this case) offsets the operating exposure. If the pound appreciates by $.05, the firm might gain \$100,000 from the enhanced value of the pound; however, it will lose that amount on its obligation to deliver the pounds for the original futures price.

In general, we can think of the hedge ratio as the number of hedging vehicles (e.g., futures contracts) one would establish to offset the risk of a particular unprotected position. The hedge ratio,  $H$ , in this example is

$$
\begin{array}{l} H = \frac {\text {C h a n g e i n v a l u e o f u n p r o t e d p o s i t i o n f o r a g i v e n c h a n g e i n e x c h a n g e r a t e}}{\text {P r o f i t d e r i v e d f r o m o n e f u t u r e s p o s i t i o n f o r t h e s a m e c h a n g e i n e x c h a n g e r a t e}} \\ = \frac {\mathbb {S} 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 \text {p e r} \mathbb {. S}. 1 0 \text {c h a n g e i n} \mathbb {S} / \mathbb {E} \text {e x c h a n g e r a t e}}{\mathbb {S}. 1 0 \text {p r o f i t p e r p o u n d d e l i v e r e d p e r} \mathbb {. S}. 1 0 \text {c h a n g e i n} \mathbb {S} / \mathbb {E} \text {e x c h a n g e r a t e}} \\ = £ 2, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 \text {t o b e d e l i v e r e d} \\ \end{array}
$$

Because each pound-futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange calls for delivery of 62,500 pounds, you would sell 2,000,000/62,500 per contract = 32 contracts.

One interpretation of the hedge ratio is as a ratio of sensitivities to the underlying source of uncertainty. The sensitivity of operating profits is 200,000 per swing of .10 in the exchange rate. The sensitivity of futures profits is .10 per pound to be delivered per swing of .10 in the exchange rate. Therefore, the hedge ratio is 200,000/.10 = 2,000,000 pounds.

We could just as easily have defined the hedge ratio in terms of futures contracts. Because each contract calls for delivery of 62,500 pounds (see Figure 23.2), the profit on each contract per swing of  $.10$  in the exchange rate is  \$6,250. Therefore, the hedge ratio defined in units of futures contracts is\$ 200,000 / 6,250 = 32 contracts, as we found above.

# Concept Check 23.2

Suppose a U.S. importer is harmed when the dollar depreciates. Specifically, suppose that its profits decrease by  \$200,000 for every$  .05 rise in the dollar/pound exchange rate. How many contracts should the firm enter? Should it take the long side or the short side of the contracts?

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/9364e73d07cebdb21a0662832b08b7ad6421ed4ce5df955a612a0d27d7667301.jpg)
Figure 23.3 Profits as a function of the exchange rate

Given the sensitivity of the unhedged position to changes in the exchange rate, calculating the risk-minimizing hedge position is easy. Estimating that sensitivity is much harder. For an exporting firm, for example, a naïve view might focus only on the expected pound-denominated revenue, and then contract to deliver that number of pounds in the futures or forward market. This approach, however, fails to recognize that pound revenue is itself a function of the exchange rate because the U.S. firm's competitive position in the U.K. is determined in part by the exchange rate.

One approach relies, in part, on historical relationships. Suppose, for example, that the firm prepares a scatter diagram as in Figure 23.3 that relates its business profits (measured in dollars) in each of the last 40 quarters to the dollar/pound exchange rate in that quarter. Profits generally are lower when the exchange rate is lower, that is, when the pound depreciates. To quantify that sensitivity, we might estimate the following regression equation:


$$
\text {P r o f i t s} = a + b (\$ / £ \text {e x c h a n g e r a t e})
$$

The slope of the regression, the estimate of  $b$ , is the sensitivity of quarterly profits to the exchange rate. For example, if the estimate of  $b$  turns out to be 2,000,000, as in Figure 23.3, then, on average, a \$1 increase in the value of the pound results in a \$2,000,000 increase in quarterly profits. This is the sensitivity we posited when we asserted that a $.10 drop in the dollar-pound exchange rate would decrease profits by \$200,000.

Of course, one must use historical experience with care. For example, one would not want to extrapolate the relationship between profitability and exchange rates from a period when the exchange rate fluctuated between  \$1.20 and\$ 1.50 per pound to scenarios in which the exchange rate might be below  \$1.00 or above\$ 2.00 per pound. Moreover, regression estimates are just that—estimates. Parameters of a regression equation are sometimes measured with considerable imprecision.

Still, historical relationships are often a good place to start when looking for the average sensitivity of one variable to another. These slope coefficients are not perfect, but they are still useful indicators of hedge ratios.

# Concept Check 23.3

United Millers purchases corn to make cornflakes. When the price of corn increases, the cost of making cereal increases, resulting in lower profits. Historically, profits per quarter have been related to the price of corn according to the equation Profits = 8 million - 1 million × Price per bushel. How many bushels of corn should United Millers purchase in the corn futures market to hedge its corn-price risk?

# 23.2 Stock-Index Futures

# The Contracts

In contrast to most futures contracts, which call for delivery of a specified commodity, stock-index contracts are settled by a cash amount equal to the value of the index on the contract maturity date times a multiplier that scales the size of the contract. The total profit to the long position is  $S_{T} - F_{0}$ , where  $S_{T}$  is the value of the stock index on the maturity date. Cash settlement avoids the costs that would be incurred if the short trader had to purchase the stocks in the index and deliver them to the long position, and if the long position then had to sell the stocks for cash. Instead, the long trader receives  $S_{T} - F_{0}$  dollars, and the short trader  $F_{0} - S_{T}$  dollars. These profits duplicate those that would arise with actual delivery.

There are several stock-index futures contracts currently traded. Table 23.1 lists some of the major ones, showing under contract size the multiplier used to calculate contract settlements. An E-mini S&P 500 contract, for example, with a futures price of 4,000 and a final index value of 4,010 would result in a profit for the long side of $50 × (4,010 - 4,000) = $500. The S&P 500 contract by far dominates the market in U.S. stock index futures.²

# Creating Synthetic Stock Positions: An Asset Allocation Tool

One reason stock-index futures are so popular is that they can substitute for holdings in the underlying stocks themselves. Index futures let investors participate in broad market movements without actually buying or selling large amounts of stock.

Because of this, we say futures represent "synthetic" holdings of the market portfolio. Instead of holding the market directly, the investor takes a long futures position in the index. The transaction costs involved in buying and selling futures positions are much lower than taking actual spot positions. "Market timers," who speculate on broad market moves rather than on individual securities, are large players in stock-index futures for this reason.

One way to market time is to shift between Treasury bills and broad-based stock market holdings. Timers attempt to shift from bills into the market before market upturns, and to shift back into bills to avoid market downturns, thereby profiting from broad market movements. In-and-out trades of this sort, however, can result in huge transaction costs. An attractive alternative is to invest in Treasury bills and hold varying amounts of market-index futures contracts, which are far cheaper to trade.

The strategy works like this. When timers are bullish, they enter long futures positions that they can liquidate quickly and cheaply when expectations turn bearish. Rather than shifting back and forth between T-bills and stocks, they buy and hold T-bills and adjust only the futures position.

You can construct a T-bill plus index futures position that duplicates the payoff to holding the stock index itself. Here is how:

1. Purchase as many market-index futures contracts as you need to establish your desired stock position. A desired holding of \$1,000 multiplied by the S&P 500 index, for example, would require the purchase of 20 contracts because each contract calls for delivery of \$50 multiplied by the index.
2. Invest enough money in T-bills to cover the payment of the futures price at the contract's maturity date. The necessary investment is simply the present value of the futures price.

# Example 23.3 Synthetic Positions Using Stock-Index Futures

Suppose that an institutional investor wants to invest 100 million in the market for one month and, to minimize trading costs, chooses to buy the S&P 500 E-mini futures contracts as a substitute for actual stock holdings. If the index is now at 4,000, the 1-month delivery futures price is 4,040, and the T-bill rate is 1\% per month, it would buy 500 contracts. (Each contract controls $50 × 4,000 = $200,000 worth of stock, and \$100 million/\$200,000 = 500.) The institution thus has a long position on \$25,000 times the S&P 500 index (500 contracts times the contract multiplier of \$50). To cover payment of the futures price, it must buy bills worth 25,000 times the present value of the futures price. This equals 25,000 × (4,040/1.01) = \$100 million market value of bills. Notice that the \$100 million outlay in bills is precisely equal to the amount that would have been needed to buy the stock directly. (The face value of the bills will be 25,000 × 4,040 = 101 million.)


This is an artificial, or synthetic, stock position. What is the value of this portfolio at the maturity date? Call  $S_T$  the value of the stock index on the maturity date  $T$  and, as usual, let  $F_0$  be the original futures price:

<table><tr><td></td><td>In General
(Per Unit of the Index)</td><td>Our Numbers</td></tr><tr><td>1. Profits from contract</td><td>ST-F0</td><td>25,000(ST-4,040)</td></tr><tr><td>2. Face value of T-bills</td><td>FO</td><td>101,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>ST</td><td>25,000ST</td></tr></table>

The total payoff on the contract maturity date is exactly proportional to the value of the stock index. In other words, adopting this portfolio strategy is equivalent to holding the stock index itself, aside from the issue of interim dividend distributions and tax treatment.

The bills-plus-futures contracts strategy in Example 23.3 may be viewed as a  $100\%$  stock strategy. At the other extreme, investing in zero futures results in a  $100\%$  bills position. Moreover, a short futures position will result in a portfolio equivalent to that obtained by short-selling the stock market index because, in both cases, the investor gains from decreases in the stock price. Bills-plus-futures mixtures clearly allow for a flexible and low-transaction-cost approach to market timing. The futures positions may be established or reversed quickly and cheaply. Also, because the short futures position allows the investor to earn interest on T-bills, it is superior to a conventional short sale of the stock, where the investor may earn little or no interest on the proceeds of the short sale.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/062545092a2b18b0d72af89b221807b4e723de32f24a158cdec8c1be8a0dfc9b.jpg)

# Concept Check 23.4

The market timing strategy of Example 23.3 also can be achieved by an investor who holds an indexed stock portfolio and "synthetically exits" the position using futures if and when he turns pessimistic concerning the market. Suppose the investor holds 100 million of stock (which is 25,000 times the current value of the index). What futures position added to the stock holdings would create a synthetic T-bill exposure when he is bearish on the market? Confirm that the profits are effectively risk-free using a table like that in Example 23.3.

# Index Arbitrage

Whenever the actual futures price differs from its parity value, there is an opportunity for profit. This is why the parity relationships are so important. Far from being theoretical academic constructs, they are in fact a guide to trading rules that can generate large profits. Index arbitrage is an investment strategy that exploits divergences between the actual futures price and its theoretically correct parity value.

In principle, index arbitrage is simple. If the futures price is too high, short the contract and buy the stocks in the index. If it is too low, buy futures and short the stocks. You can perfectly hedge your position and should earn arbitrage profits equal to the mispricing of the contract.

Although it is simple in theory, index arbitrage can be difficult to implement. The problem lies in buying "the stocks in the index." Selling or purchasing shares in all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 is impractical for two reasons. The first is transaction costs, which may outweigh any profits to be made from the arbitrage. Second, index arbitrage calls for the purchase or sale of shares of 500 different firms simultaneously, and any lags in the execution of such a strategy can destroy the effectiveness of a plan to exploit temporary price discrepancies. Don't forget that others also will be trying to exploit any deviations from parity, and if they trade first, they may move prices before your trade is executed.

Arbitrageurs need to trade an entire portfolio of stocks quickly and simultaneously if they hope to exploit disparities between the futures price and its corresponding stock index. For this they need a coordinated trading program; hence the term program trading, which refers to purchases or sales of entire portfolios of stocks. Electronic trading enables traders to submit coordinated buy or sell programs to the stock market at once.

The success of these arbitrage positions and associated program trades depends on only two things: the relative levels of spot and futures prices and synchronized trading in the two markets. Because arbitrageurs exploit disparities in futures and spot prices, absolute price levels are unimportant.

# Using Index Futures to Hedge Market Risk

Futures contracts also may be used to hedge market exposure. Suppose, for example, that you manage a 30 million portfolio with a beta of .8. You are bullish on the market over the long term, but you are afraid that over the next two months, the market is vulnerable to a sharp downturn. If trading were costless, you could sell your portfolio, place the proceeds in T-bills for two months, and then reestablish your position after you perceive that the risk of the downturn has passed. In practice, however, this strategy would result in unacceptable trading costs, not to mention the tax consequences of the realization of capital gains or losses on the portfolio. An alternative approach would be to use stock index futures to hedge your market exposure.

# Example 23.4 Hedging Market Risk

Suppose that the S&P 500 index currently is at 4,000. A decrease in the index to 3,900 would represent a drop of  $2.5\%$ . With a portfolio beta of .8, you would expect a loss of  $.8 \times 2.5\% = 2\%$ , or, in dollar terms,  $0.2 \times \$30$  million =  $\$600,000$ . Therefore, the sensitivity of your portfolio value to market movements is  $\$600,000$  per 100-point movement in the S&P 500 index.

To hedge this risk, you could sell stock index futures. When your portfolio falls in value along with declines in the broad market, the futures contract will provide an offsetting profit.

The sensitivity of a futures contract to market movements is easy to determine. With its contract multiplier of  \$50, the profit on the S&P 500 futures contract varies by\$ 5,000 for every 100-point swing in the index. Therefore, to hedge your market exposure for two months, you could calculate the hedge ratio as follows:


$$
H = \frac {\text {C h a n g e i n p o r t f o l i o v a l u e}}{\text {P r o f i t o n o n e f u t u r e s c o n t r a c t}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 6 0 0 , 0 0 0}{\mathbb {S} 5 , 0 0 0} = 1 2 0 \text {c o n t r a c t s (s h o r t)}
$$

You would enter the short side of the contracts because you want profits from the contract to offset the exposure of your portfolio to the market. Because your portfolio does poorly when the market falls, you need a position that will do well when the market falls.

We also could approach the hedging problem in Example 23.4 using a similar regression procedure as that illustrated in Figure 23.3 for foreign exchange risk. The predicted value of the portfolio is graphed in Figure 23.4 as a function of the value of the S&P 500 index. With a beta of .8, the slope of the relationship is 6,000: A  $2.5\%$  increase in the index, from 4,000 to 4,100, results in a capital gain of  $2\%$  of \$30 million, or \$ 600,000. Therefore, your portfolio will increase in value by \$6,000 for each increase of one point in the index. As a result, you should enter a short position on 6,000 units of the S&P 500 index to fully offset your exposure to marketwide movements. Because the contract multiplier is \$ 50 times the index, you need to sell 6,000/50 = 120 contracts.

Notice that when the slope of the regression line relating your unprotected position to the value of an asset is positive, your hedge strategy calls for a short position in that asset. The hedge ratio is the negative of the regression slope. This is because the hedge position should offset your initial exposure. If you do poorly when the asset value falls, you need a short position that will do well when the asset value falls.

Active managers sometimes believe that a particular asset is underpriced but that the market as a whole is about to fall. Even if the asset is a good buy relative to other stocks, it still might perform poorly in a broad market downturn. Therefore, the manager would like to separate the bet on the firm from the bet on the market: Any investment in the company must be offset with a hedge against the market exposure that normally would accompany a stock purchase. In other words, the manager seeks a market-neutral bet on the stock, by which we mean that the manager buys the stock to capture its alpha (its abnormal risk-adjusted expected return) but hedges market exposure, resulting in a position beta of zero.

Figure 23.4 Predicted value of the portfolio as a function of the market index


By hedging the market, the portfolio manager can make stock picks without concern for the market exposure of those stocks. Once the stocks are chosen, the overall market risk of the portfolio can be modulated to any degree using the stock futures contracts. Here again, the stock's beta is the key to the hedging strategy. We discuss market-neutral strategies in more detail in Chapter 26.

# Example 23.5 Market-Neutral Active Stock Selection

Suppose the beta of the stock is 3/3, and the manager purchases \$1.5 million worth of the stock. For every 3\% drop in the broad market, the stock would be expected to respond with a drop of 3/3 × 3\% = 2\%, or \$30,000. The S&P 500 contract will fall by 120 points from a current value of 4,000 if the market drops 3\%. With the contract multiplier of \$50, this would entail a profit to a short futures position of 120 × \$50 = 6,000 per contract. Therefore, the market risk of the stock can be offset by shorting five S&P contracts. More formally, we can calculate the hedge ratio as

$$
\begin{array}{l} H = \frac {\text {Expected change in stock value per 3\% market drop}}{\text {Profit on one short contract per 3\% market drop}} \\ = \frac {\mathbb {S} 3 0 , 0 0 0 \text {s w i n g i n u n p r o t e c t e d p o s i t i o n}}{\mathbb {S} 6 , 0 0 0 \text {p r o f i t p e r c o n t r a c t}} \\ = 5 \mathrm {c o n t r a c t s} \\ \end{array}
$$

Now that market risk is hedged, the only source of variability in the performance of the stock-plus-futures portfolio will be the firm-specific performance of the stock.

# 23.3 Interest Rate Futures

# Hedging Interest Rate Risk

Like equity managers, fixed-income managers also sometimes desire to hedge market risk, in this case resulting from movements in the term structure of interest rates. Consider, for example, these problems:

1. A fixed-income manager holds a bond portfolio on which considerable capital gains have been earned. She foresees an increase in interest rates but is reluctant to sell her portfolio and replace it with a lower-duration mix of bonds because such rebalancing would result in large trading costs as well as realization of capital gains for tax purposes. Still, she would like to hedge her exposure to interest rate increases.
2. A corporation plans to issue bonds to the public. However, it cannot issue the bonds for another three months because of the lags inherent in SEC registration. It would like to hedge the uncertainty surrounding the yield at which it eventually will be able to sell the bonds.

3. A pension fund will receive a large cash inflow next month that it plans to invest in long-term bonds. It is concerned that interest rates may fall by the time it can make the investment and would like to lock in the yield currently available on long-term issues.

In each of these cases, the investment manager wishes to hedge interest rate uncertainty. To illustrate, we will focus on the first example, and suppose that the portfolio manager has a \$10 million bond portfolio with a modified duration of nine years. If, as feared, market interest rates increase and the bond portfolio's yield also rises, say, by 10 basis points (.10\%), the fund will suffer a capital loss. Recall from Chapter 16 that the capital loss in percentage terms will be the product of modified duration,  $D^{*}$ , and the increase in the portfolio yield. Therefore, the loss will be

$$
D ^ {*} \times \Delta y = 9 \times .10 \% = .90 \%
$$ or  \$90,000. Equivalently, the price response of the unprotected portfolio to changes in market yields is\$ 9,000 per 1 basis point change in the yield. Market practitioners call this ratio the price value of a basis point, or PVBP. Here, we've shown that


$$
\mathrm {P V B P} = \frac {\text {C h a n g e i n p o r t f o l i o v a l u e}}{\text {P r e d i c t e d c h a n g e i n y i e l d}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 9 0 , 0 0 0}{1 0 \text {b a s i s p o i n t s}} = \mathbb {S} 9, 0 0 0 \text {p e r b a s i s p o i n t}
$$

One way to hedge this exposure is to take an offsetting position in an interest rate futures contract, for example, the Treasury bond contract. The contract nominally calls for delivery of  \$100,000 par value T-bonds with 6\%$  coupons and 20-year maturity. In practice, delivery terms are fairly complicated because many bonds with different coupon rates and maturities may be substituted to settle the contract. To simplify, we will assume that the bond to be delivered is known and has a modified duration of 10 years. Finally, suppose that the futures price currently is 90 per \$100 par value. Because the contract actually requires delivery of \$100,000 par value of bonds, the contract multiplier is 1,000.

Given these data, we can calculate the PVBP for the futures contract. If the yield on the delivery bond increases by 10 basis points, the bond value will fall by  $D^{*} \times .1\% = 10 \times .1\% = 1\%$ . The futures price also will decline  $1\%$ , from 90 to 89.10. Because the contract multiplier is  $\1,000$ , the gain on each short contract will be  $\$ 1,000 \times .90 = \$900 . Therefore, the PVBP for one futures contract is  $\$900 / 10\$ -basis-point change, or  $\$90$  for a change in yield of 1 basis point.

Now we can easily calculate the hedge ratio as follows:

$$
H = \frac {\text {P V B P o f p o r t f o l i o}}{\text {P V B P o f h e d g e v h i c l e}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 9 , 0 0 0}{\mathbb {S} 9 0 \text {p e r c o n t r a c t}} = 1 0 0 \text {c o n t r a c t s}
$$

Therefore, 100 T-bond futures contracts will offset the portfolio's exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

Notice that this is another example of a market-neutral strategy. In Example 23.5, which illustrated an equity-hedging strategy, stock-index futures were used to drive a portfolio beta to zero. In this application, we used a T-bond contract to drive the interest rate exposure of a bond position to zero. The hedged fixed-income position has a duration (or a PVBP) of zero. The source of risk differs, but the hedging strategy is essentially the same.

# Concept Check 23.5

Suppose the bond portfolio is twice as large, 20 million, but that its modified duration is only 4.5 years. Show that the proper hedge position in T-bond futures is the same as the value just calculated, 100 contracts.

Although the hedge ratio is easy to compute, the hedging problem in practice is more difficult. We assumed in our example that the yields on the T-bond contract and the bond portfolio would move perfectly in unison. Although interest rates on various fixed-income instruments do tend to vary in tandem, there is slippage across sectors of the fixed-income market. For example, Figure 23.5 shows that the spread between long-term corporate and 10-year Treasury bond yields has fluctuated considerably over time. Our hedging strategy would be fully effective only if the yield spread across the two sectors were constant (or at least perfectly predictable) so that yield changes in both sectors were equal.

This problem highlights the fact that most hedging activity is in fact cross-hedging, meaning that the hedge vehicle is a different asset than the one to be hedged. Unless the returns on the two assets are perfectly correlated, the hedge will not be perfect. Cross-hedges can eliminate a large fraction of the total risk of the unprotected portfolio, but you should be aware that they typically are not risk-free positions.

# 23.4 Swaps

Swaps are multiperiod extensions of forward contracts. For example, rather than agreeing to exchange British pounds for U.S. dollars at an agreed-upon forward price at one single date, a foreign exchange swap would call for an exchange of currencies on several future dates. The parties might exchange  \$1.3 million for\$ 1 million in each of the next five years. Similarly, interest rate swaps call for the exchange of a series of cash flows proportional to a given interest rate for a corresponding series of cash flows proportional to a floating interest rate. $^{6}$  One party might receive a variable cash flow equal to  \$1 million times a short-term interest rate and pay\$ 1 million times a fixed interest rate of 5\% for each of the next seven years.


The swap market is a huge component of the derivatives market, with more than 400 trillion in interest rate and exchange rate swap agreements outstanding. We can illustrate how these contracts work using the following example.

# Example 23.6 Interest Rate Swap

Consider the manager of a large portfolio that currently includes  \$100 million par value of long-term bonds paying an average coupon rate of 7\%$ . The manager believes interest rates are about to rise. As a result, he would like to sell the bonds and replace them with either short-term or floating-rate issues. However, it would be exceedingly expensive in terms of transaction costs to replace the portfolio every time the forecast for interest rates is updated. A cheaper and more flexible approach is to "swap" the 7 million a year in interest income the portfolio currently generates for an amount of money tied to the short-term interest rate. That way, if rates do rise, so will interest income.

A swap dealer might advertise its willingness to exchange, or "swap," a cash flow based on the LIBOR or SOFR rate for one based on a fixed rate of  $7\%$ . Until recently, LIBOR (the London Interbank Offer Rate) was by far the most common short-term rate used in the swaps market. However, as detailed in Chapter 2, LIBOR is currently being phased out, and U.S. dollar-denominated interest-rate swaps are increasingly pegged to SOFR (the secured overnight financing rate) based on overnight repurchase agreements. We therefore will use SOFR as our benchmark short-term rate.

A portfolio manager who enters the swap agreement would pay the dealer  $7 \%$ on notional principal of  $100 million and receive payment of SOFR \times$ 100 million. $^{8}$  The manager’s net cash flow from the swap agreement is therefore (SOFR – .07) × 100 million. The participants have agreed to exchange a fixed cash flow for a variable one.

Now consider the portfolio's net cash flow in three interest rate scenarios:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="3">SOFR Rate</td></tr><tr><td>6.5\%</td><td>7.0\%</td><td>7.5\%</td></tr><tr><td>Interest income from bond portfolio (= 7\% of \$100 million bond portfolio)</td><td>$7,000,000</td><td>$7,000,000</td><td>\$7,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cash flow from swap [= (SOFR - 7\%) × notional principal of \$100 million]</td><td>(500,000)</td><td>0</td><td>500,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total (= SOFR × \$100 million)</td><td>$6,500,000</td><td>$7,000,000</td><td>7,500,000</td></tr></table>

The total income on the overall position—bonds plus swap agreement—equals the SOFR rate in each scenario times 100 million. The manager has, in effect, converted a fixed-rate bond portfolio into a synthetic floating-rate portfolio.

${}^{6}$  Interest rate swaps have nothing to do with the Homer-Liebowitz bond swap taxonomy described in Chapter 16.
The most popular interest rate swap had been based on the 3-month LIBOR rate. To mimic this 3-month contract, a 3-month version of SOFR is computed by daily compounding of the overnight SOFR rate for the 3-month period ending on the settlement date. There is also a 1-month version of the SOFR rate, but in this case, the 30 relevant daily overnight rates are averaged without compounding.
The participants to the swap do not loan each other money. They agree only to exchange a fixed cash flow for a variable cash flow that depends on the short-term interest rate. This is why the principal is described as notional. The notional principal is simply a way to describe the size of the swap agreement. In this example, a  $7\%$  fixed rate is exchanged for the SOFR rate; the difference between SOFR and  $7\%$  is multiplied by notional principal to determine the net cash flow.

# Swaps and Balance Sheet Restructuring

Example 23.6 illustrates why swaps have tremendous appeal to fixed-income managers. These contracts allow them to quickly, cheaply, and anonymously restructure the balance sheet. Suppose a corporation that has issued fixed-rate debt believes that interest rates are likely to fall; it might prefer to have issued floating-rate debt. In principle, it could issue floating-rate debt and use the proceeds to buy back the outstanding fixed-rate debt. But it is faster and easier to convert the outstanding fixed-rate debt into synthetic floating-rate debt by entering a swap to receive a fixed interest rate (offsetting its fixed-rate coupon obligation) and paying a floating rate.

Conversely, a bank that pays current market interest rates to its depositors, and thus is exposed to increases in rates, could enter a swap to receive a floating rate and pay a fixed rate on some amount of notional principal. This swap position, added to its floating-rate deposit liability, would result in a net liability of a fixed stream of cash. The bank might then be able to invest in long-term fixed-rate loans without encountering interest rate risk.

For another example, consider a fixed-income portfolio manager who wishes to switch back and forth between a fixed- or floating-rate profile quickly and cheaply as forecasts for interest rates change. A manager who holds a fixed-rate portfolio can transform it into a synthetic floating-rate portfolio by entering a pay fixed-receive floating swap and can later transform it back by entering the opposite side of a similar swap.

Foreign exchange swaps also enable the firm to quickly and cheaply restructure its balance sheet. Suppose, for example, that a firm issues  \$10 million in debt at an 8\%$  coupon rate but actually prefers that its interest obligations be denominated in British pounds. For example, the issuing firm might be a British corporation that perceives advantageous financing opportunities in the United States but prefers pound-denominated liabilities. Then the firm, whose debt currently obliges it to make dollar-denominated payments of 800,000, can agree to swap a given number of pounds each year for 800,000. By so doing, it effectively covers its dollar obligation and replaces it with a new pound-denominated obligation.

# Concept Check 23.6

Show how a firm that has issued a floating-rate bond with a coupon equal to the SOFR rate can use swaps to convert that bond into synthetic fixed-rate debt. Assume the terms of the swap allow an exchange of SOFR for a fixed rate of  $8\%$ .

# The Swap Dealer

What about the swap dealer? Why is the dealer, which is typically a financial intermediary such as a bank, willing to take on the opposite side of the swaps desired by the participants in these hypothetical swaps?

Consider a dealer who takes on one side of a swap, let's say paying SOFR and receiving a fixed rate. The dealer will search for another trader in the swap market who wishes to receive a fixed rate and pay SOFR. For example, Company A may have issued a  $7\%$  coupon fixed-rate bond that it wishes to convert into synthetic floating-rate debt, while Company B may have issued a floating-rate bond tied to SOFR that it wishes to convert into synthetic fixed-rate debt. The dealer will enter a swap with Company A in which it pays a fixed rate and receives SOFR, and will enter another swap with Company B in which it pays SOFR and receives a fixed rate. When the two swaps are combined, the dealer's position is effectively neutral on interest rates, paying SOFR on one swap and receiving it on another. Similarly, the dealer pays a fixed rate on one swap and receives it on another. The dealer becomes little more than an intermediary, funneling payments from one party to the other. The dealer finds this activity profitable because it will charge a bid-ask spread on the transaction.


This arrangement is illustrated in Figure 23.6. Company A has issued  $7\%$  fixed-rate debt (the leftmost arrow in the figure) but enters a swap to pay the dealer SOFR and receive a  $6.95\%$  fixed rate. Therefore, the company's net payment is  $7\% + (\mathrm{SOFR} - 6.95\%) = \mathrm{SOFR} + .05\%$ . It has thus transformed its fixed-rate debt into synthetic floating-rate debt. Conversely, Company B has issued floating-rate debt paying SOFR (the rightmost arrow) but enters a swap to pay a  $7.05\%$  fixed rate in return for SOFR. Therefore, its net payment is  $\mathrm{SOFR} + (7.05\% - \mathrm{SOFR}) = 7.05\%$ . It has transformed its floating-rate debt into synthetic fixed-rate debt. The bid-ask spread, the source of the dealer's profit, is  $10\%$  of notional principal each year.

# Concept Check 23.7

A pension fund holds a portfolio of money market securities that the manager believes are paying excellent yields compared to comparable short-term securities. However, the manager believes that interest rates are about to fall. What type of swap will allow the fund to continue to hold its portfolio of short-term securities while at the same time benefiting from a decline in rates?

# Other Interest Rate Contracts

Swaps are multiperiod forward contracts that trade over the counter. There are also exchange-listed contracts that trade on interest rates. The biggest of these in terms of trading activity is the Eurodollar contract, the listing for which we show in Figure 23.7.

Figure 23.7 Eurodollar futures

Source: The Wall Street Journal, October 7, 2021.

The Eurodollar contract is essentially a forward contract on the 3-month LIBOR rate. Contracts now trade on three-month and 1-month SOFR, but so far, the LIBOR-based Eurodollar contract still dominates in terms of trading volume.

Both the SOFR and Eurodollar contracts provide profits (or losses) proportional to the difference between the relevant short-term interest rate at contract maturity and the rate agreed to in the contract. However, the listing conventions for these contracts are a bit peculiar. Consider, for example, the first contract listed in Figure 23.7, which matures in October 2021. The settlement price is presented as  $F_{0} = 99.87$ . However, this value is not really a price. In effect, participants in the contract negotiate over the contract interest rate, and the so-called futures price is actually set equal to  $100 -$  Contract rate. Because the futures price is 99.87, the contract rate is  $100 - 99.87$ , or  $0.13\%$ . Similarly, the final futures price on the contract maturity date will be marked to  $F_{T} = 100 - \mathrm{LIBOR}_{T}$ . Thus, profits to the buyer of the contract will be proportional to


$$
F _ {T} - F _ {0} = (1 0 0 - \operatorname {L I B O R} _ {T}) - (1 0 0 - \operatorname {C o n t r a c t r a t e}) = \operatorname {C o n t r a c t r a t e} - \operatorname {L I B O R} _ {T}
$$

Thus, the contract design allows participants to trade directly on the LIBOR rate. The contract multiplier is \$1 million, but the LIBOR rate on which the contract is written is a 3-month (quarterly) rate; for each basis point that the (annualized) LIBOR increases, the quarterly interest rate increases by only  $\frac{1}{4}$  of a basis point, and the profit to the buyer decreases by

$$
. 0 0 0 1 \times 1 / 4 \times \$ 1, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 = \$ 2 5
$$

Examine the payoff on the contract and you will see that, in effect, the Eurodollar contract allows traders to "swap" a fixed interest rate (the contract rate) for a floating rate (LIBOR). Thus, this is in effect a one-period interest rate swap. Notice in Figure 23.7 that the total open interest on this contract is enormous—nearly 4 million contracts just for maturities extending to one year. Moreover, while not presented in Figure 23.7, significant trading in Eurodollars takes place for contract maturities extending out to 10 years. Contracts with such long-term maturities are quite unusual. They reflect the fact that the Eurodollar contract is used by dealers in long-term interest rate swaps as a hedging tool.

# Swap Pricing

How can the fair swap rate be determined? For example, how would we know what fixed interest rate is a fair exchange for LIBOR or SOFR? Or what is the fair swap rate between dollars and pounds for a foreign exchange swap? We can address these questions by interpreting a swap as an implicit exchange of bonds. Let's start with interest rate swaps.

Imagine a firm that issues at par value a floating-rate note paying a coupon rate equal to SOFR and uses the proceeds to purchase (also for par value) a 5-year fixed-rate note paying a coupon rate of  $6\%$ . For simplicity, we will assume that both bonds entail annual

<table><tr><td></td><td>Time 0
(Bonds issued)</td><td>Years 1–5
(Coupons paid)</td><td>Year 5
(Bonds Mature)</td></tr><tr><td>Issue floating-rate note</td><td>+\$100</td><td>-SOFR × $100</td><td>-$100</td></tr><tr><td>Purchase fixed-rate note with a fixed 6\% coupon rate</td><td>-$100</td><td>0.06 × $100</td><td>+\$100</td></tr><tr><td>Net cash flow</td><td>0</td><td>(0.06 – SOFR) × 100</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

Cash flows to a firm issuing a floating-rate note and purchasing a fixed-rate bond. (Annual coupons, both bonds issued at par value of \$100 million. Cash flows in millions.) coupon payments and that the size of both issues is \$100 million. Table 23.3 lays out the firm's cash flows.


The firm's initial net cash flow is zero, as the funds raised by issuing the floating-rate note are used to purchase the fixed-rate note. Similarly, the net cash flow associated with the bond redemptions in year 5 is zero: The maturing fixed-rate bond held by the firm pays off par value, which provides just enough cash to pay off the face value of the floating-rate bond the firm issued.

The interesting column of Table 23.3 corresponds to the net cash flow in years 1-5. The firm pays the floating rate each year and receives a fixed rate of  $6\%$ , both on par value of \$100 million. The firm's net cash flows in each year are precisely the same as it would receive on a 5-year SOFR interest-rate swap with a  $6\%$  fixed rate. We conclude that the firm has "synthetically engineered" a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap, which, just like actual swaps, entails a zero net cash flow when entered into. Therefore, the fixed rate on an actual swap contract must match the  $6\%$  coupon the firm pays when it engineers the synthetic swap. The coupon rates on fixed-versus floating-rate bonds that can be issued at par thus determine the terms that swap dealers will be willing to post for interest rate swaps.

Currency swaps can be priced similarly. Table 23.4 considers a U.S. firm that issues a  \$150 million par value bond in the U.S. with a coupon rate of 6\%$ , just enough to allow it to issue the bond at par value. The current exchange rate is 1.50/£, so the firm can convert the money raised into £100 million and use it to purchase a pound-denominated £100 million par value bond in the U.K., where the coupon rate on bonds selling at par is, let's say,  $5\%$ .

Table 23.3

<table><tr><td></td><td>Time 0(Bonds issued)</td><td>Years 1–5(Coupons paid)</td><td>Year 5(Bonds mature)</td></tr><tr><td>Issue dollar note, par value = \$150 million, coupon rate = 6\%</td><td>+$150</td><td>-0.06 × $150</td><td>-\$150</td></tr><tr><td>Purchase pound note, par value = £100 million, coupon rate = 5\%</td><td>-£100 = -\$150</td><td>0.05 × £100</td><td>+£100</td></tr><tr><td>Net cash flow</td><td>0</td><td>£5 – \$9</td><td>£100 – 150</td></tr></table>

Table 23.4

Cash flows to a firm issuing a dollar-denominated bond and purchasing a pound-denominated bond. (Cash flows in millions.)

As was true of interest-rate swaps, the firm has engineered a synthetic currency swap, with an initial net cash flow of zero. The firm is committed to exchanging  \$9 million for\$ 5 million British pounds for the next five years. Unlike interest-rate swaps, however, the final net cash flow when the bonds are redeemed at maturity is not necessarily zero. This is because the exchange rate in five years generally will not remain at its initial value of \$1.50/£. Instead, the final cash flow entails an additional exchange of \$150 million for £100 million. Nevertheless, as was true for interest rate swaps, the interpretation of a swap as an exchange of bonds determines the swap cash flows that currency dealers will offer to market participants.

Why might a firm engage in a currency swap? Perhaps a British firm wishes to finance a project in the United States and, to hedge its exchange-rate risk, wants its financing cash flows to be denominated in dollars to match its anticipated dollar-denominated operating cash flows. But the firm believes it can obtain better borrowing terms in the United Kingdom, where it is better known. The firm might decide to raise £100 million in Great Britain and enter the swap in Table 23.4. The swap is effectively a long position in a pound-denominated note (offsetting its borrowing position in the U.K.) and a short position in a dollar-denominated note (meaning its net financing cash flows are now denominated in the same currency as its operating cash flows).

# Credit Risk in the Swap Market

The huge size of the swap market has given rise to periodic concern about credit risk and the possibility of a default by a major swap trader. Actually, although credit risk in the swap market is not trivial, it is not nearly as large as the magnitude of notional principal in these markets would suggest. To see why, think about the losses one trader would incur if its counterparty defaulted.

When the swap is initiated, it has zero net present value to both parties for the same reason that a forward contract has zero value at inception: Both are simply contracts to exchange cash in the future at terms established today, and those terms make both parties willing to enter the deal. Therefore, at contract inception, the net present value of the contract must be zero. Even if one party were to back out of the deal at this moment, it would not cost its counterparty anything because another trader could be found to take its place.

Once interest or exchange rates change, however, the situation is not as simple. Suppose, for example, that interest rates increase shortly after an interest-rate swap agreement has begun. The floating-rate payer therefore suffers a loss, while the fixed-rate payer enjoys a gain. If the floating-rate payer reneges on its commitment at this point, the fixed-rate payer suffers a loss. However, that loss is not as large as the notional principal of the swap, for the default of the floating-rate payer relieves the fixed-rate payer from its obligation as well. The loss is only the difference between the values of the fixed-rate and floating-rate obligations, not the total value of the payments that the floating-rate payer was originally obligated to make.

# Example 23.7 Credit Risk in Swaps

Consider a swap written on 1 million of notional principal that calls for exchange of SOFR for a fixed rate of 4 \%for five years. Suppose, for simplicity, that the yield curve is currently flat at 4 \%With SOFR equal to 4 \%, no cash flows will be exchanged unless interest rates change. But now suppose that the yield curve immediately shifts up to 5 \%The floating-rate payer now is obligated to pay a cash flow of (.05 – .04) × \$ 1million = \$ 10,000 each year to the fixed- rate payer (as long as rates remain at 5 \% ). If the floating-rate payer defaults on the swap, the fixed- rate payer loses that 5- year annuity. The present value of that annuity is \$ 10,000 \times Annuity factor (5\%, 5 years) = \$ 43,295, which is only a bit more than 4 \%of notional principal. We conclude that the credit risk of the swap is far less than notional principal.

# Credit Default Swaps

Despite the similarity in names, a credit default swap (CDS) is wholly different from an interest rate or currency swap. As we saw in Chapter 14, payment on a CDS is tied to the financial status of one or more reference firms; the CDS therefore allows two counterparties to take positions on the credit risk of those firms. When a particular "credit event" is triggered, say, default on an outstanding bond or failure to pay interest, the swap seller is expected to cover the loss in the market value of the bond. He may be obligated to pay par value to take delivery of the defaulted bond (in which case the swap is said to entail physical settlement) or may instead pay the swap buyer the difference between the par value and market value of the bond (termed cash settlement). The swap purchaser pays a periodic fee to the seller for this protection against credit events.

Unlike interest rate swaps, credit default swaps do not entail periodic netting of one reference rate against another. They are in fact more like insurance policies written on particular credit events. Bondholders may buy these swaps to transfer their credit risk exposure to the swap seller, effectively enhancing the credit quality of their portfolios. Unlike conventional insurance policies, however, swaps allow you to buy "insurance" on bonds that you don't actually own. Therefore, credit default swaps can be used purely to speculate on changes in the credit standing of the reference firms.

# 23.5 Commodity Futures Pricing

Commodity futures prices are governed by the same general considerations as stock futures. One difference, however, is that the cost of "carrying" commodities, especially those subject to spoilage, is greater than the cost of carrying financial assets. The underlying asset for some contracts, such as electricity futures, simply cannot be "carried" or held in a portfolio. Finally, spot prices for some commodities demonstrate marked seasonal patterns that can affect futures pricing.

# Pricing with Storage Costs

In addition to interest costs, carrying commodities also entails storage costs, insurance costs, and an allowance for spoilage. To price commodity futures, we use the familiar arbitrage strategy that calls for holding the asset and hedging its value with a short position in a futures contract. We will denote the price of the commodity at contract maturity (time  $T$ ) as  $P_T$ , and to simplify, we will assume that all noninterest carrying costs ( $C$ ) are paid in one lump sum at maturity.


<table><tr><td>Action</td><td>Initial Cash Flow</td><td>CF at Time T</td></tr><tr><td>Buy asset; pay carrying costs at T</td><td>-P0</td><td>P_T-C</td></tr><tr><td>Borrow P0; repay with interest at time T</td><td>P0</td><td>-P0(1+rf)</td></tr><tr><td>Short futures position</td><td>0</td><td>F0-P_T</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>0</td><td>F0-P0(1+rf)-C</td></tr></table>

Because market prices should not allow for arbitrage opportunities, the terminal cash flow of this zero-net-investment, risk-free strategy should be zero.

If the cash flow were positive, this strategy would yield guaranteed profits with no net investment. If the cash flow were negative, the reverse of this strategy also would yield risk-free profits. While the reverse strategy entails a short sale of the commodity, which is unusual, it may be done as long as the short sale contract appropriately accounts for storage costs.[10] Thus, we conclude that

$$
F _ {0} = P _ {0} (1 + r _ {f}) + C
$$

Finally, if we define  $c = C / P_0$  and interpret  $c$  as the percentage "rate" of carrying costs, we may write

$$
F _ {0} = P _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f} + c\right) \tag {23.3}
$$ which is a (1-year) parity relationship for futures involving storage costs.


Compare Equation 23.3 to the parity relation for stocks, Equation 22.1 from the previous chapter, and you will see that they are extremely similar. In fact, if we think of carrying costs as a "negative dividend," the equations are identical. This makes intuitive sense because, instead of receiving a dividend yield of  $d$ , the storer of the commodity must pay a storage cost of  $c$ .

Although we have called  $c$  the carrying cost of the commodity, it is better to interpret it more generally as the net carrying cost, that is, the carrying cost net of the benefits derived from holding the commodity in inventory. For example, part of the "convenience yield" of goods held in inventory is the protection against stocking out, which may result in lost production or sales.

It is vital to note that we derive Equation 23.3 assuming that the asset can and will be bought and stored. But two kinds of commodities cannot be expected to be stored. The first kind is commodities for which storage is technologically not feasible, such as electricity. The second includes goods that are not stored for economic reasons. For example, it would be foolish to buy an agricultural commodity now, planning to store it for ultimate use in three years. Because agricultural prices fall as each crop is harvested, it usually makes no sense to store the commodity across crop cycles. Someone who anticipates a need for the crop in three years would be wise to delay the purchase until after the harvest of the third year and avoid paying storage costs. Moreover, if the crop in the third year is comparable to this year's, you could obtain it at roughly the same price as you would pay this year. By waiting to purchase, you avoid both interest and storage costs.

Because storage across harvests generally will be avoided, Equation 23.3 should not be expected to apply for holding periods that span harvest times, nor should it apply to perishable goods that are available only "in season." Whereas the futures price for gold, which is a stored commodity, increases steadily with the maturity of the contract, the futures price for wheat is seasonal; its futures price typically falls across harvests between March and July as new supplies become available.

Figure 23.8 is a stylized version of the seasonal price pattern for an agricultural product. Clearly this pattern differs from financial assets such as stocks or gold for which there is no seasonal price movement. Financial assets are priced so that holding them in a portfolio produces a fair expected return. Agricultural prices, in contrast, are subject to steep periodic drops as each crop is harvested, which makes storage across harvests generally unprofitable and therefore upends arbitrage strategies like those that led to Equation 23.3.

Futures pricing across seasons therefore requires a different approach that is not based on storage. In place of general no-arbitrage restrictions, we rely instead on discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.

# Concept Check 23.9

People are willing to buy and "store" shares of stock despite the fact that their purchase ties up capital. Most people, however, are not willing to buy and store soybeans. What is the difference in the properties of the expected evolution of stock prices versus soybean prices that accounts for this result?

# Discounted Cash Flow Analysis for Commodity Futures

Given an expected spot price and the risk characteristics of that price, we can measure the present value of a claim to receive a commodity at some future date. We obtain the appropriate discount rate from a model such as the CAPM or APT and discount the expected spot price using that rate, as illustrated in the following example.

# Example 23.8 Commodity Futures Pricing

Table 23.5, which presents betas on a variety of commodities, shows that the beta of orange juice was estimated to be .117. If the T-bill rate is currently  $5\%$  and the historical market risk premium is about  $8\%$ , the appropriate discount rate for orange juice would be given by the CAPM as

$$
5 \% + . 1 1 7 \times 8 \% = 5. 9 4 \%
$$

If the expected spot price for orange juice six months from now is 1.45 per pound, the present value of a 6-month deferred claim to a pound of orange juice is

$$
\$ 1. 4 5 / (1. 0 5 9 4) ^ {2} = \$ 1. 4 0 9
$$

What would be the proper futures price for orange juice? The contract calls for the ultimate exchange of orange juice for the futures price. We have just shown that the present value of the juice is 1.409. This should equal the present value of the futures price that will be paid for the juice. A commitment to a payment of F 0 dollars in six months has a present value of F 0 / (1.05) 1/2 = .976 × F 0. Notice that the discount rate applied to the futures price is the risk-free rate of 5\% because the promised payment is fixed and therefore independent of market conditions.

To find the equilibrium futures price, equate the present values of the promised payment of  $F_{0}$  and the promised receipt of orange juice:

$$
. 9 7 6 F _ {0} = \$ 1. 4 0 9
$$ and solve to find that F_{0} = \1.444


The general rule, then, to determine the futures price is to equate the present value of the future payment of  $F_{0}$  with that of the commodity to be received. This implies

$$
\frac {F _ {0}}{(1 + r _ {f}) ^ {T}} = \frac {E (P _ {T})}{(1 + k) ^ {T}}
$$ or


$$
F _ {0} = E \left(P _ {T}\right) \left(\frac {1 + r _ {f}}{1 + k}\right) ^ {T} \tag {23.4}
$$ where  $k$  is the required rate of return on the commodity, which may be obtained from a risk-return model such as the CAPM.

Equation 23.4 is perfectly consistent with the spot-futures parity relationship. For example, apply Equation 23.4 to the futures price for a stock paying no dividends. Because the entire return on the stock is in the form of capital gains, the expected rate of capital gains must equal  $k$ , the required rate of return on the stock. Thus, the expected price of the stock is its current price times  $(1 + k)^T$ , or  $E(P_T) = P_0(1 + k)^T$ . Substituting this expression into Equation 23.4 results in  $F_0 = P_0(1 + r_f)^T$ , which is exactly the parity relationship.

# Concept Check 23.10

Suppose that the systematic risk of orange juice increases, holding the expected time  $T$  price of juice constant. If the expected spot price is unchanged, will the futures price change? In what direction? What is the intuition behind your answer?

1. Foreign exchange futures trade on several foreign currencies. The interest rate parity relationship for foreign exchange futures is

SUMMARY

$$
F _ {0} = E _ {0} \left(\frac {1 + r _ {\mathrm {U S}}}{1 + r _ {\mathrm {f o r e i n g}}}\right) ^ {T}
$$ with exchange rates quoted as dollars per foreign currency. Deviations of the futures price from this value imply an arbitrage opportunity.


2. Futures contracts are traded on several stock market indexes. The contracts may be mixed with Treasury bills to construct artificial equity positions, which makes them potentially valuable tools for market timers. Index contracts are used also by arbitrageurs who attempt to profit from violations of the spot-futures parity relationship.
3. Hedging requires investors to purchase assets that will offset the sensitivity of their portfolios to particular sources of risk. A hedged position requires that the hedging vehicle provide profits that offset variation in the value of the position to be protected.
4. The hedge ratio is the number of hedging vehicles such as futures contracts required to offset the risk of the unprotected position. The hedge ratio for systematic market risk is proportional to the size and beta of the underlying stock portfolio. The hedge ratio for fixed-income portfolios is proportional to the price value of a basis point, which in turn is proportional to modified duration and the size of the portfolio.
5. Many investors such as hedge funds use hedging strategies to create market-neutral bets on perceived instances of relative mispricing between two or more securities. These are not arbitrage strategies, but pure plays on a particular perceived profit opportunity.
6. Interest rate futures contracts may be written on the prices of debt securities (as in the case of Treasury-bond futures contracts) or on interest rates directly (as in the case of Eurodollar or SOFR contracts).
7. Swaps, which call for the exchange of a series of cash flows, may be viewed as portfolios of forward contracts. Each transaction may be viewed as a separate forward agreement. However, instead of pricing each exchange independently, the swap sets one "forward price" that applies to all of the transactions. Therefore, the swap price will be an average of the forward prices that would prevail if each exchange were priced separately.

8. Commodity futures pricing is complicated by costs for storage of the underlying commodity. When the asset is willingly stored by investors, the storage costs net of convenience yield enter the futures pricing equation as follows:

$$
F _ {0} = P _ {0} (1 + r _ {f} + c) ^ {T}
$$

The non-interest net carrying costs,  $c$ , play the role of a "negative dividend" in this context.

9. When commodities are not stored for investment purposes, the equilibrium futures price can be derived from general risk-return principles. In this case,

$$
F _ {0} = E (P _ {T}) \left(\frac {1 + r _ {f}}{1 + k}\right) ^ {T}
$$

This futures price is fully consistent with spot-futures parity for stored assets.

# PROBLEM SETS

1. A stock's beta is a key input to hedging in the equity market. A bond's duration is key in fixed-income hedging. How are they used similarly? Are there any differences in the calculations necessary to formulate a hedge position in each market?
2. A U.S. exporting firm may use foreign exchange futures to hedge its exposure to exchange rate risk. Its position in futures will depend in part on anticipated payments from its customers denominated in foreign currency.

a. In general, however, should its position in futures be more or less than the number of contracts necessary to hedge these anticipated cash flows? (Hint: Think about the firm's stream of cash flows extending out over many years.)
$b$ . What other considerations might enter into the hedging strategy?

3. Both gold-mining firms and oil-producing firms might choose to use futures to hedge uncertainty in future revenues due to price fluctuations. But trading activity sharply tails off for maturities beyond one year. Suppose a firm wishes to use available (short maturity) contracts to hedge commodity prices at a more distant horizon, say, four years from now. Do you think the hedge will be more effective for the oil- or the gold-producing firm?

4. You believe that the spread between municipal bond yields and U.S. Treasury bond yields is going to narrow in the coming month. How can you profit from such a change using the municipal bond and T-bond futures contracts?

5. Consider the futures contract written on the S&P 500 index and maturing in one year. The interest rate is 3\%, and the future value of dividends expected to be paid over the next year is 70. The current index level is 4,000. Assume that you can short sell the S&P index.

a. Suppose the expected rate of return on the market is  $8\%$ . What is the expected level of the index in one year?
b. What is the theoretical no-arbitrage price for a 1-year futures contract on the S&P 500 stock index?

b. If the average price of a share on the NYSE is about 40, how much is the transaction cost per "typical share" controlled by one futures contract?
c. For small investors, a typical transaction cost (including the bid-ask spread) for direct trades in stocks might be about 5 cents per share. How many times the transactions costs in futures markets is this?

7. You manage a 42 million portfolio, currently all invested in equities, and believe that the market is on the verge of a big but short-lived downturn. You would move your portfolio temporarily into T-bills, but you do not want to incur the transaction costs of liquidating and reestablishing your equity position. Instead, you decide to temporarily hedge your equity holdings with E-mini S&P 500 index futures contracts.

a. Should you be long or short the contracts? Why?
b. If your equity holdings are invested in a market-index fund, into how many contracts should you enter? The S&P 500 index is now at 4,200 and the contract multiplier is 50.
c. How does your answer to part  $(b)$  change if the beta of your portfolio is .6?

8. A manager is holding a 1 million stock portfolio with a beta of 1.25. She would like to hedge the risk of the portfolio using the S&P 500 stock index futures contract. How many dollars' worth of the index should she sell in the futures market to minimize the volatility of her position?

Suppose that the relationship between the rate of return on Digital Computer Corp. stock, the market index, and a computer industry index can be described by the following regression equation:  $r_{\text{Digital}} = .5r_M + .75r_{\text{Industry}}$ . If a futures contract on the computer industry is traded, how would you hedge the exposure to the systematic and industry factors affecting the performance of Digital stock? Specifically, how many dollars' worth of the market and industry index contracts would you buy or sell for each dollar held in Digital?
 10. Suppose that the spot price of the euro is currently \$1.10. The 1-year futures price is \$1.15. Is the interest rate higher in the United States or the euro zone?

13. Farmer Brown grows Number 1 red corn and would like to hedge the value of the coming harvest. However, the futures contract is traded on the Number 2 yellow grade of corn. Suppose that yellow corn typically sells for  $90\%$  of the price of red corn. If he grows 100,000 bushels, and each futures contract calls for delivery of 5,000 bushels, how many contracts should Farmer Brown buy or sell to hedge his position?

15. Yields on short-term bonds tend to be more volatile than yields on long-term bonds. Suppose that you have estimated that the yield on 20-year bonds changes by 10 basis points for every 15-basis-point move in the yield on 5-year bonds. You hold a \$1 million portfolio of 5-year maturity bonds with modified duration four years and desire to hedge your interest rate exposure with T-bond futures, which currently have modified duration nine years and sell at F0 = \$95. How many futures contracts should you sell?

16. A manager is holding a 1 million bond portfolio with a modified duration of eight years. She would like to hedge the risk of the portfolio by short-selling Treasury bonds. The modified duration of T-bonds is 10 years. How many dollars' worth of T-bonds should she sell to minimize the variance of her position?

17. A corporation plans to issue 10 million of 10-year bonds in three months. At current yields the bonds would have modified duration of eight years. The T-note futures contract is selling at F₀ = 100 and has modified duration of six years. How can the firm use this futures contract to hedge the risk surrounding the yield at which it will be able to sell its bonds? Both the bond and the contract are at par value.

18. a. If the spot price of gold is 1,500 per troy ounce, the risk-free interest rate is 2\%, and storage and insurance costs are zero, what should be the forward price of gold for delivery in one year? Use an arbitrage argument to prove your answer.

19. If the corn harvest today is poor, would you expect this fact to have any effect on today's futures prices for corn to be delivered (post-harvest) two years from today? Under what circumstances will there be no effect?

20. Suppose that the price of corn is risky, with a beta of .5. The monthly storage cost is $.03 per bushel, and the current spot price is \$5.50, with an expected spot price in three months of 5.88. If the expected rate of return on the market is 0.9\% per month, with a risk-free rate of 0.5\% per month, would you store corn for three months?

21. Suppose the U.S. yield curve is flat at 4\% and the euro yield curve is flat at 3\%. The current exchange rate is \$1.10 per euro. What cash flows will be exchanged on a 4-year foreign exchange swap with notional principal of 100 million euros (or equivalently, at current exchange rates, \$110 million)?

22. Desert Trading Company has issued \$100 million worth of long-term bonds at a fixed rate of 7\%. The firm then enters into an interest rate swap where it pays SOFR and receives a fixed 6\% on notional principal of \$100 million. What is the firm's effective interest rate on its borrowing?

23. Firm ABC enters a 5-year swap with firm XYZ to pay SOFR in return for a fixed  $6\%$  rate on notional principal of \$10 million. Two years from now, the market rate on 3-year swaps is SOFR for  $5\%$ ; at this time, firm XYZ goes bankrupt and defaults on its swap obligation.

$a$ . Why is firm ABC harmed by the default?
$b$ . What is the market value of the loss incurred by ABC as a result of the default?
c. Suppose instead that ABC had gone bankrupt. How do you think the swap would be treated in the reorganization of the firm?

24. Suppose that at the present time, one can enter 5-year swaps that exchange SOFR for  $5\%$ . An off-market swap would then be defined as a swap of SOFR for a fixed rate other than  $5\%$ . For example, a firm with  $7\%$  coupon debt outstanding might like to convert to synthetic floating-rate debt by entering a swap in which it pays SOFR and receives a fixed rate of  $7\%$ . What up-front payment will be required to induce a counterparty to take the other side of this swap? Assume notional principal is 10 million.


25. Suppose the 1-year futures price on a stock-index portfolio is 3,828, the stock index currently is 3,800, the 1-year risk-free interest rate is 3\%, and the year-end dividend that will be paid on a \$3,800 investment in the market index portfolio is \$80.

$a$ . By how much is the contract mispriced?
b. Formulate a zero-net-investment arbitrage portfolio and show that you can lock in riskless profits equal to the futures mispricing.
c. Now assume (as is true for small investors) that if you short sell the stocks in the market index, the proceeds of the short sale are kept with the broker, and you do not receive any interest income on the funds. Is there still an arbitrage opportunity (assuming that you don't already own the shares in the index)? Explain.
d. Given the short-sale rules, what is the no-arbitrage band for the stock-futures price relationship? That is, given a stock index of 3,800, how high and how low can the futures price be without giving rise to arbitrage opportunities?

26. Consider these data for the S&P 500 future's contract maturing in, exactly one year. The S&P 500 index is at 4,290, and the contract price is  $F_{0} = 4,292$ .

a. If the current interest rate is  $2.5\%$ , and the average dividend rate of the stocks in the index is  $1.9\%$ , what fraction of the proceeds of stock short sales would need to be available to you to earn arbitrage profits?
$b$ . Suppose now that you in fact have access to  $90\%$  of the proceeds from a short sale. What is the lower bound on the futures price that rules out arbitrage opportunities?
c. By how much does the actual futures price fall below the no-arbitrage bound?
$d$ . Formulate the appropriate arbitrage strategy, and calculate the profits to that strategy.

1. Donna Doni, CFA, wants to explore potential inefficiencies in the futures market. The TOBEC stock index has a spot value of 185. TOBEC futures contracts are settled in cash and underlying contract values are determined by multiplying \$100 times the index value. The current annual risk-free interest rate is  $6.0\%$ .

a. Calculate the theoretical price of the futures contract expiring six months from now, using the cost-of-carry model. The index pays no dividends.

4. After studying Iris Hamson's credit analysis, George Davies is considering whether he can increase the holding-period return on Yucatan Resort's excess cash holdings (which are held in pesos) by investing those cash holdings in the Mexican bond market. Although Davies would be investing in a peso-denominated bond, the investment goal is to achieve the highest holding-period return, measured in U.S. dollars, on the investment.

Davies finds the higher yield on the Mexican 1-year bond, which is considered to be free of credit risk, to be attractive, but he is concerned that depreciation of the peso will reduce the holding-period return, measured in U.S. dollars. Hamson has prepared the following selected financial data to help Davies make the decision:

Selected Economic and Financial Data

<table><tr><td colspan="2">U.S. 1-year Treasury bond yield</td><td>2.5\%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Mexican 1-year bond yield</td><td>6.5\%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Nominal Exchange Rates</td></tr><tr><td>Spot</td><td>9.5000 pesos = U.S. \$1.00</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1-year forward</td><td>9.8707 pesos = U.S. \$1.00</td><td></td></tr></table>

Hanson recommends buying the Mexican 1-year bond and hedging the foreign currency exposure using the 1-year forward exchange rate. Calculate the U.S. dollar holding-period return that would result from the transaction recommended by Hamson. Is the U.S. dollar holding-period return resulting from the transaction more or less than that available in the U.S.?

5. a. Pamela Itsuji, a currency trader for a Japanese bank, is evaluating the price of a 6-month Japanese yen/U.S. dollar currency futures contract. She gathers the following currency and interest rate data:

Japanese yen/U.S. dollar spot currency exchange rate ¥124.30/1.00

6-month Japanese interest rate (annualized) 0.10\%

6-month U.S. interest rate (annualized) 3.80\%

Calculate the theoretical price for a 6-month Japanese yen/U.S. dollar currency futures contract, using the data above.

b. Itsuji is also reviewing the price of a 3-month Japanese yen/U.S. dollar currency futures contract, using the currency and interest rate data shown below. Because the 3-month Japanese interest rate has just increased to .50\%, Itsuji recognizes that an arbitrage opportunity exists and decides to borrow 1 million to purchase Japanese yen. Calculate the yen arbitrage profit from Itsuji's strategy, using the following data:

Japanese yen/U.S. dollar spot currency exchange rate ¥124.30/1.00

New 3-month Japanese interest rate  $0.50\%$

3-month U.S. interest rate 3.50\%

3-month currency futures contract value ¥123.2605/1.00

6. Janice Delsing, a U.S.-based portfolio manager, manages an \$800 million portfolio (\$600 million in stocks and \$200 million in bonds). In reaction to anticipated short-term market events, Delsing wishes to adjust the allocation to 50\% stock and 50\% bonds through the use of futures. Her position will be held only until "the time is right to restore the original asset allocation." Delsing determines a financial futures-based asset allocation strategy is appropriate. The stock futures index multiplier is \$50 and the denomination of the bond futures contract is 100,000. Other information relevant to a futures-based strategy is as follows:

Bond portfolio modified duration 5 years

Bond portfolio yield to maturity 7\%

Price value of a basis point of bond futures  $\$ {97.85}$

Stock-index futures price 4,134

Stock portfolio beta 1.0 a. Describe the financial futures-based strategy needed and explain how the strategy allows Delsing to implement her allocation adjustment. No calculations are necessary.

b. Compute the number of each of the following needed to implement Delsing's asset allocation strategy. (You can assume that investors can hold fractional positions in futures contracts.) i. Bond futures contracts.

ii. Stock-index futures contracts.

7. Use the following information to solve this problem.

<table><tr><td>Issue</td><td>Price</td><td>Yield to Maturity</td><td>Modified Duration*</td></tr><tr><td>U.S. Treasury bond 113¼\% maturing Nov. 15, 2035</td><td>100</td><td>11.75\%</td><td>7.6 years</td></tr><tr><td>U.S. Treasury long bond futures contract (contract expiration in 6 months)</td><td>63.33</td><td>11.85\%</td><td>8.0 years</td></tr><tr><td>XYZ Corporation bond 12½\% maturing June 1, 2030 (sinking fund debenture, rated AAA)</td><td>93</td><td>13.50\%</td><td>7.2 years</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Volatility of AAA corporate bond yields relative to U.S. Treasury bond yields = 1.25 to 1.0 (1.25 times)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Assume no commission and no margin requirements on U.S. Treasury long bond futures contracts.

*Modified duration = Duration/(1 + y).

Situation A A fixed-income manager holding a 20 million market value position of U.S. Treasury 113/4\% bonds maturing November 15, 2035, expects the economic growth rate and the inflation rate to be above market expectations in the near future. Institutional rigidities prevent any existing bonds in the portfolio from being sold in the cash market.

Situation B The treasurer of XYZ Corporation has recently become convinced that interest rates will decline in the near future. He believes it is an opportune time to purchase his company's sinking fund bonds in advance of requirements because these bonds are trading at a discount from par value. He is preparing to purchase in the open market  \$20 million par value XYZ Corporation 12½\% bonds maturing June 1, 2030. A\$ 20 million par value position of these bonds is currently offered in the open market at 93. Unfortunately, the treasurer must obtain approval from the board of directors for such a purchase, and this approval process can take up to two months. The board of directors' approval in this instance is only a formality.

For each of these two situations, demonstrate how interest rate risk can be hedged using the Treasury bond futures contract. Show all calculations, including the number of futures contracts used.

8. Why might individuals purchase futures contracts rather than the underlying asset?

9. Are the following statements true or false? Why?

a. All else equal, the futures price on a stock index with a high dividend yield should be higher than the futures price on an index with a low dividend yield.
b. All else equal, the futures price on a high-beta stock should be higher than the futures price on a low-beta stock.
$c$ . The beta of a short position in the S&P 500 futures contract is negative.

10. What is the difference between the futures price and the value of the futures contract?

11. You ran a regression of the yield of KC Company's 10-year bond on the 10-year U.S. Treasury benchmark's yield using month-end data for the past year. You found the following result:

$$
Y i e l d _ {K C} = 0. 5 4 + 1. 2 2 Y i e l d _ {T r e a s u r y}
$$ where  $\mathrm{Yield}_{\mathrm{KC}}$  is the yield on the KC bond and  $\mathrm{Yield}_{\mathrm{Treaty}}$  is the yield on the U.S. Treasury bond. The modified duration on the 10-year U.S. Treasury is 7.0 years, and modified duration on the KC bond is 6.93 years.


a. Calculate the percentage change in the price of the 10-year U.S. Treasury, assuming a 50-basis-point change in the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury.
b. Calculate the percentage change in the price of the KC bond, using the regression equation above, assuming a 50-basis-point change in the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. According to interest rate parity, F 0 should be 1.3386. Because the futures price is too high, we should reverse the arbitrage strategy just considered.

2. Because the firm does poorly when the dollar depreciates, it hedges with a futures contract that will provide profits when the dollar declines. It needs to enter a long position in pound futures, which means that it will earn profits on the contract when the futures price increases, that is, when more dollars are required to purchase one pound. The specific hedge ratio is determined by noting that if the number of dollars required to buy one pound rises by $.05, profits decrease by \$200,000 at the same time that the profit on a long future contract would increase by $.05 × 62,500 = $3,125. The hedge ratio is

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 \text {p e r} \mathbb {. S}. 0 5 \text {d e p r e c i a t i o n i n t h e d o l d a r}}{\mathbb {S} 3 , 1 2 5 \text {p e r c o n t r a c t p e r} \mathbb {. S}. 0 5 \text {d e p r e c i a t i o n}} = 6 4 \text {c o n t r a c t s l o n g}
$$

3. Each \$1 increase in the price of corn reduces profits by \$1 million. Therefore, the firm needs to enter futures contracts to purchase 1 million bushels at a price stipulated today. The futures position will profit by \$1 million for each increase of \$1 in the price of corn. The profit on the contract will offset the lost profits on operations.

<table><tr><td>4.</td><td>In General

The net cash flow is riskless and provides a  $1\%$  monthly rate of return, equal to the risk-free rate.

5. The price value of a basis point is still \$9,000, as a 1-basis-point change in the interest rate reduces the value of the \$20 million portfolio by .01\% × 4.5 = .045\%. Therefore, the number of futures needed to hedge the interest rate risk is the same as for a portfolio half the size with double the modified duration.

6.

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="3">SOFR</td></tr><tr><td>Cash flow to the firm</td><td>7\%</td><td>8\%</td><td>9\%</td></tr><tr><td>As bond issuer, firm pays (SOFR × \$10 million)</td><td>-700,000</td><td>-800,000</td><td>-900,000</td></tr><tr><td>As fixed payer on the swap, firm receives \$10 million × (SOFR – 0.08)</td><td>-100,000</td><td>0</td><td>+100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Net cash flow</td><td>-800,000</td><td>-800,000</td><td>-800,000</td></tr></table>

Regardless of the SOFR rate, the firm's net cash outflow equals  $.08 \times$  principal, just as if it had issued a fixed-rate bond with a coupon of  $8\%$ .

7. The manager would like to hold on to the money market securities because of their attractive relative pricing compared to other short-term assets. However, there is an expectation that rates will fall. The manager can hold this particular portfolio of short-term assets and still benefit from the drop in interest rates by entering a swap to pay a short-term interest rate and receive a fixed interest rate. The resulting synthetic fixed-rate portfolio will increase in value if rates do fall.

9. Stocks offer a total return (capital gain plus dividends) large enough to compensate investors for the time value of the money tied up in the stock. Agricultural prices do not necessarily increase over time. In fact, across a harvest, crop prices will fall. The returns necessary to make storage economically attractive are lacking.

10. If systematic risk were higher, the appropriate discount rate,  $k$ , would increase. Referring to Equation 23.4, we conclude that  $F_0$  would fall. Intuitively, the claim to 1 pound of orange juice is worth less today if its expected price is unchanged, while the risk associated with the value of that claim increases. Therefore, the amount investors are willing to pay today for future delivery is lower.

# Portfolio Performance Evaluation

# 24

MOST FINANCIAL ASSETS are managed by professional investors, who thus at least indirectly allocate the lion's share of capital across firms. Efficient allocation therefore depends on the quality of these professionals and the ability of financial markets to identify and direct capital to the best stewards. Therefore, if capital markets are to be reasonably efficient, investors must be able to measure the performance of their asset managers.

How can we evaluate investment performance? It turns out that even an average portfolio return is not as straightforward to measure as it might seem. In addition, adjusting average returns for risk presents a host of other problems. In the end, performance evaluation is far from trivial.

We begin this chapter with the measurement of portfolio returns. From there we move on to conventional approaches to risk adjustment. We consider the situations in which each of the standard risk-adjusted performance measures will be of most interest to investors and show how style analysis may be viewed as a generalization of the index model and the alpha statistic that it generates.


Performance measurement becomes far more difficult when managers change portfolio composition during the measurement period, so we also examine the complications posed by changes in the risk characteristics of the portfolio. One particular way in which this may occur is when managers attempt to time the broad market and adjust portfolio beta in anticipation of market movements. Market timing raises a wide range of issues in performance evaluation.

We close the chapter with a look at performance attribution techniques. These are tools used to decompose managers' performance into results that can be attributed to security selection, sector selection, and asset allocation decisions.

# 24.1 The Conventional Theory of Performance Evaluation

# Average Rates of Return

We defined the holding-period return (HPR) in Section 5.1 of Chapter 5 and explained the difference between the arithmetic and geometric average. We begin with a brief review.

Suppose we evaluate the performance of a portfolio over a period of 20 years. The arithmetic average return is the sum of the 20 annual returns divided by 20. In contrast, the geometric average is the constant annual return over the 20 years that would provide the same total cumulative return over the entire investment period. Therefore, the geometric average,  $r_{G}$ , is defined by


$$
(1 + r _ {G}) ^ {2 0} = (1 + r _ {1}) (1 + r _ {2}) \dots (1 + r _ {2 0})
$$

The right-hand side of this equation is the compounded final value of a  \$1 investment earning the 20 annual rates of return. The left-hand side is the compounded value of a\$ 1 investment earning  $r_G$  each year. We solve for  $1 + r_G$  as

$$
1 + r _ {G} = \left[ (1 + r _ {1}) (1 + r _ {2}) \dots (1 + r _ {2 0}) \right] ^ {1 / 2 0}
$$

Each return has an equal weight in the geometric average. For this reason, the geometric average is referred to as a time-weighted average.

# Time-Weighted Returns versus Dollar-Weighted Returns

To set the stage for the more subtle issues that follow, let's start with a trivial example. Consider a stock paying a dividend of  \$2 annually that currently sells for\$ 50. You purchase the stock today, collect the \$2 dividend, and then sell the stock for \$53 at year-end. Your rate of return is

$$
\frac{\text{Total proceeds}}{\text{Initial investment}} = \frac{\text{Income} + \text{Capital gain}}{50} = \frac{2 + 3}{50} = .10, \text{or} 10\%
$$

Another way to derive the rate of return that is useful in the more difficult multiperiod case is to set up the investment as a discounted cash flow problem. Call  $r$  the rate of return that equates the present value of all cash flows from the investment with the initial outlay. In our example, the stock is purchased for  \$50 and generates cash flows at year-end of\$ 2 (dividend) plus \$53 (sale of stock). Therefore, we solve  $50 = (2 + 53) / (1 + r)$  to find again that  $r = .10$ , or  $10\%$ .

When we consider investments over a period during which cash was added to or withdrawn from the portfolio, measuring the rate of return becomes more difficult. To continue our example, suppose that you purchase a second share of the same stock at the end of the first year and hold both shares until the end of year 2, at which point you sell each share for 54.

Total cash outlays and inflows are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Time</td><td>Outlay</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>\$50 to purchase first share</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>\$53 to purchase second share a year later</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Proceeds</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>\$2 dividend from initially purchased share</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>\$4 dividend from the 2 shares held in the second year, plus \$108 received from selling both shares at \$54 each</td></tr></table>

Using the discounted cash flow (DCF) approach, we can solve for average return by equating the present values of the cash inflows and outflows:

$$
5 0 + \frac {5 3}{1 + r} = \frac {2}{1 + r} + \frac {1 1 2}{(1 + r) ^ {2}}
$$ resulting in  $r = 7.117\%$ . This is the internal rate of return on the investment.


The internal rate of return is called the dollar-weighted rate of return. It is "dollar weighted" because the stock's performance in the second year, when two shares of stock are held, has a greater influence on the average overall return than the first-year return, when only one share is held.

The time-weighted (geometric average) return is  $7.81\%$

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {1} = \frac {53 + 2 - 50}{50} = . 10 = 10 \% \quad r _ {2} = \frac {54 + 2 - 53}{53} = 0.566 = 5.66 \% \\ r _ {G} = (1. 1 0 \times 1. 0 5 6 6) ^ {1 / 2} - 1 = . 0 7 8 1 = 7. 8 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

The dollar-weighted average is less than the time-weighted average in this example because the return in the second year, when more money was invested, is lower.

# Concept Check 24.1

Shares of XYZ Corp. pay a \$2 dividend at the end of every year on December 31. An investor buys two shares of the stock on January 1 at a price of \$20 each, sells one of those shares for \$22 a year later on the next January 1, and sells the second share an additional year later for \$19. Find the dollar- and time-weighted rates of return on the 2-year investment.

# Adjusting Returns for Risk

Evaluating performance based on average return alone is not very useful because returns must be adjusted for risk before they can be compared meaningfully. The simplest and most popular way to make the adjustment is to compare rates of return with those of portfolios with similar risk characteristics. For example, high-yield bond portfolios are grouped into one comparison universe, growth stock equity funds are grouped into another, and so on. Then the (usually time-weighted) average returns of each fund within the universe are ordered, and each portfolio manager receives a percentile ranking of relative performance within the comparison group. For example, the manager with the ninth-best performance in a universe of 100 funds would be the 90th percentile manager: That performance was better than  $90\%$  of all competing funds over the evaluation period.


These relative rankings are usually displayed in a chart such as that in Figure 24.1. The chart summarizes performance rankings over four periods: one quarter, one year, three years, and five years. The top and bottom lines of each box are drawn at the rate of return of the 95th and 5th percentile managers. The three dashed lines correspond to the rates of return of the 75th, 50th (median), and 25th percentile managers. The diamond is drawn at the average return of a particular fund and the square is drawn at the return of a benchmark index, such as the S&P 500. The placement of the diamond within the box is an easy-to-read representation of the performance of the fund relative to the comparison universe.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/2a68f2f9cbc1032cf0874f3e8a4bd70d0ebb902e4a2f4fb66be0781019228f55.jpg)
Figure 24.1 Universe comparison, periods ending December 31, 2028

This comparison of performance with other managers of similar investment style is a useful first step in evaluating performance. However, such rankings can be misleading. Within a particular universe, some managers may concentrate on particular subgroups, so portfolio characteristics are not truly comparable. For example, within the equity universe, one manager may concentrate on high-beta or aggressive growth stocks. Similarly, within fixed-income universes, durations can vary across managers.

A more fundamental problem with the comparison universe methodology is that the benchmark performance is not an investable strategy. When we evaluate the performance of investment professionals and implicitly ask if they have justified their expenses, we would like to compare their performance to what would have been available to a passive investor. Market index portfolios, many of which are available as mutual funds or ETFs, are natural benchmarks because investors can use these products to match the return on the index. In contrast, the median fund in Figure 24.1 cannot be known in advance. Because passive investors cannot reliably lock in the median return, it is an unsatisfactory benchmark.

These considerations suggest that a more precise means for risk adjustment is desirable.

# Risk-Adjusted Performance Measures

Methods of risk-adjusted performance evaluation using mean-variance criteria came on stage simultaneously with the capital asset pricing model. Jack Treynor, $^{2}$  William Sharpe, $^{3}$  and Michael Jensen $^{4}$  recognized immediately the implications of the CAPM for rating the performance of managers. Within a short time, academicians were in command of a battery of performance measures, and a bounty of scholarly investigation of mutual fund performance was pouring from ivory towers. Shortly thereafter, agents emerged who were willing to supply rating services to portfolio managers and their clients.

But while widely used, risk-adjusted performance measures each have their own limitations. Moreover, their reliability requires a long history of consistent management with a steady level of performance and a representative sample of investment environments: bull as well as bear markets.

We start by cataloging some common risk-adjusted performance measures for a portfolio,  $P$ , and examine the circumstances in which each might be most relevant.

1. Sharpe ratio:  $(\overline{r}_P - \overline{r}_f) / \sigma_P$

The Sharpe ratio divides average portfolio excess return over the sample period by the standard deviation of returns over that period. It measures the reward to (total) volatility trade-off.

2. Treynor measure:  $(\overline{r}_P - \overline{r}_f) / \beta_P$

Like the Sharpe ratio, Treynor's measure gives excess return per unit of risk, but it uses systematic risk instead of total risk.

3. Jensen's alpha:  $\alpha_{P} = \overline{r}_{P} - \left[\overline{r}_{f} + \beta_{P}(\overline{r}_{M} - \overline{r}_{f})\right]$

Jensen's alpha is the average return on the portfolio over and above that predicted by the CAPM, given the portfolio's beta and the average market return.

2Jack L. Treynor, "How to Rate Management Investment Funds," Harvard Business Review 43 (January-February 1966).

William F. Sharpe, "Mutual Fund Performance," Journal of Business 39 (January 1966).

Michael C. Jensen, “The Performance of Mutual Funds in the Period 1945–1964,” Journal of Finance, May 1968; and Michael C. Jensen, “Risk, the Pricing of Capital Assets, and the Evaluation of Investment Portfolios,” Journal of Business, April 1969.

We place bars over  $r_f$  as well as  $r_P$  to denote the fact that because the risk-free rate may not be constant over the measurement period, we are taking a sample average, just as we do for  $r_P$ . Equivalently, we may simply compute sample average excess returns.

# 4. Information ratio:  $\alpha_{P} / \sigma (e_{P})$

The information ratio divides the alpha of the portfolio by nonsystematic risk, called "tracking error" in the industry. It measures abnormal return per unit of risk that in principle could be diversified away by holding a market index portfolio. (We should note that industry jargon tends to be a little loose concerning this topic. Some define the information ratio as excess return—rather than alpha—per unit of nonsystematic risk, using appraisal ratio to refer to the ratio of alpha to nonsystematic risk. Unfortunately, terminology is not fully uniform, and you may well encounter both of these definitions. We will consistently define the information ratio as we have done here, specifically as the ratio of alpha to the standard deviation of residual returns.)

Each performance measure has some appeal. But as Concept Check 24.2 shows, these competing measures do not necessarily provide consistent assessments of performance because the risk measures used to adjust returns differ substantially. Therefore, we need to consider the circumstances in which each of these measures is appropriate.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/afd2e5831d238b1b38c4281f098dcc46ee7bbf92d9e41c244dd86b6bcfb87eda.jpg)

# Concept Check 24.2

<table><tr><td></td><td>Portfolio P</td><td>Market M</td></tr><tr><td>Average return</td><td>35\%</td><td>28\%</td></tr><tr><td>Beta</td><td>1.20</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>Standard deviation</td><td>42\%</td><td>30\%</td></tr><tr><td>Tracking error (nonsystematic risk), σ(e)</td><td>18\%</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

Calculate the following performance measures for portfolio  $P$  and the market: Sharpe, Jensen (alpha), Treynor, information ratio. The T-bill rate during the period was  $6\%$ . By which measures did portfolio  $P$  outperform the market?

# The Sharpe Ratio for Overall Portfolios

In Chapter 6, we introduced criteria for the investor's optimal risky portfolio. If investor preferences can be summarized by a mean-variance utility function, the criterion becomes particularly straightforward. In this case, the investor wants to maximize the Sharpe ratio  $\left[E(r_{P}) - r_{f}\right] / \sigma_{P}$ . Recall that this criterion led to the selection of the tangency portfolio in Chapter 7. The problem reduces to the search for the portfolio with the highest possible Sharpe ratio. The Sharpe ratio is the slope of the capital allocation line, and investors will naturally seek the portfolio that provides the greatest slope, that is, the greatest increase in expected return for each unit increase in volatility.

We focus here on total volatility rather than systematic risk because we are looking at the entire risky portfolio rather than a small component of it. The benchmark for acceptable performance is the Sharpe ratio of the market index because the investor can easily achieve that performance by investing in an indexed equity mutual fund. To be considered attractive, the actively managed portfolio must offer a higher Sharpe ratio than that of the market index.

The  $M^2$  Measure and the Sharpe Ratio While the Sharpe ratio can be used to rank portfolio performance, its numerical value is not easy to interpret. Comparing the ratios for portfolios  $M$  and  $P$  in Concept Check 24.2, you should have found that  $S_P = .69$  and  $S_M = .73$ . This suggests that portfolio  $P$  underperformed the market index. But is a difference of .04 in the Sharpe ratio economically meaningful? We often compare rates of return, but these values are difficult to interpret.

An equivalent representation of Sharpe's ratio was proposed by Graham and Harvey, and later popularized by Leah Modigliani of Morgan Stanley and her grandfather Franco Modigliani, past winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics. Their approach has been dubbed the  $M^2$  measure (for Modigliani-squared). Like the Sharpe ratio,  $M^2$  focuses on total volatility as a measure of risk, but its risk adjustment leads to an easy-to-interpret differential return relative to the benchmark index.

To compute  $M^2$ , we imagine that an active portfolio,  $P$ , is mixed with a position in T-bills so that the resulting "adjusted" portfolio matches the volatility of a passive market index such as the S&P 500. For example, if the active portfolio has 1.5 times the standard deviation of the index, you would mix it with T-bills using proportions of 1/3 in bills and 2/3 in the active portfolio. The resulting adjusted portfolio, which we call  $P^*$ , would then have the same standard deviation as the index. (If the active portfolio had lower standard deviation than the index, it would be leveraged by borrowing money and investing the proceeds in the portfolio.) Because the market index and portfolio  $P^*$  have the same standard deviation, we may compare their performance simply by comparing returns. This is the  $M^2$  measure for portfolio  $P$ :

$$
M _ {P} ^ {2} = r _ {P *} - r _ {M} \tag {24.1}
$$

# Example 24.1  $M^2$  Measure

Consider the performance of portfolio  $P$  and the market index portfolio  $M$  from Concept Check 24.2. Portfolio  $P$  had the higher return, but it also had higher risk, with the result that its Sharpe ratio was less than the market's. In Figure 24.2, we plot the average return and volatility of each portfolio and draw the capital allocation line for each. Portfolio  $P$ 's CAL is less steep than the CML, consistent with its lower Sharpe ratio.

The adjusted portfolio  $P^*$  is formed by mixing bills with portfolio  $P$ . We use weights  $30 / 42 = .714$  in  $P$  and  $1 - .714 = .286$  in T-bills. By construction, the adjusted portfolio has exactly the same standard deviation as the market index:  $30 / 42 \times 42\% = 30\%$ . Despite its equal volatility, its return would be only  $(.286 \times 6\%) + (.714 \times 35\%) = 26.7\%$ , which is less than that of the market index.

You can see in Figure 24.2 that portfolio  $P^{*}$  is formed by moving down portfolio  $P$ 's capital allocation line (by mixing  $P$  with T-bills) until we reduce the standard deviation by just enough to match that of the market index.  $M^2$  is the vertical distance between points  $M$  and  $P^{*}$ . The  $M^2$  of portfolio  $P$  is therefore  $26.7\% - 28\% = -1.3\%$ ; the negative  $M^2$  is consistent with the inferior Sharpe ratio.

# The Treynor Ratio

In many circumstances, you may have to select funds or portfolios that will be mixed together to form the investor's overall risky portfolio. For example, the manager in charge of a large pension plan might parcel out the total assets to several portfolio managers. Consider CalPERS (the California Public Employee Retirement System), which had a portfolio of about 456 billion in mid-2022. Like many large plans, it uses a fund of funds approach, allocating the endowment among a number of professional managers (funds). How should you compare performance across candidate managers in this context?

When employing a number of managers, the nonsystematic risk of each will be largely diversified away, so only systematic risk is relevant. The appropriate performance metric when evaluating components of the full risky portfolio is now the Treynor measure: This reward-to-risk ratio divides expected excess return by systematic risk (i.e., by beta).

John R. Graham and Campbell R. Harvey, "Grading the Performance of Market Timing Newsletters," Financial Analysts Journal 53 (November/December 1997), pp. 54-66; and Franco Modigliani and Leah Modigliani, "Risk-Adjusted Performance," Journal of Portfolio Management, Winter 1997, pp. 45-54.

Suppose the relevant data for two portfolios and the market index are given in Table 24.1. Portfolio  $Q$  has an alpha of  $3.5\%$ , while that of portfolio  $U$  is  $3\%$ . It might appear that you would prefer portfolio  $Q$ , but this turns out not to be the case. To see why, turn to Figure 24.3. As in Figure 24.2, we plot portfolios on a return-risk graph, but now measure risk using beta.

The SML is the lower line from the risk-free rate on the vertical axis through point  $M$ . Its slope is the market's Treynor ratio, the increase in return per increase in beta offered by portfolios formed by mixing the market index with T-bills.

The middle line through point  $Q$  shows us all the beta-return combinations that can be achieved by mixing bills with portfolio  $Q$ . The slope of this line is portfolio  $Q$ 's Treynor ratio, so we call it the  $T_{Q}$ -line. Similarly, the  $T_{U}$ -line goes from the risk-free rate through point  $U$ .

As always, the investor wants the portfolio that provides the best risk-return trade-off. When we measure risk using beta, that will be the portfolio with the steepest  $T$ -line, or, equivalently, the portfolio with the highest Treynor ratio. Therefore, we see that despite its lower alpha, portfolio  $U$  actually will be preferred to portfolio  $Q$ . For any level of risk (beta), it provides the higher return.

Figure 24.2 The  $M^2$  of portfolio  $P$  is negative even though its average return was greater than that of the market index,  $M$

We can compare the performance of each portfolio to the market index using a measure similar to  $M^2$ . We will again combine portfolios with T-bills to match market risk so that we can directly compare rates of return. Here, however, because we use beta to measure risk, we will form adjusted portfolios designed to match the beta of the market index (which, of course, is 1). We form the adjusted portfolio  $Q^*$  by mixing  $Q$  with T-bills. We seek portfolio proportions that will make the beta of  $Q^*$  equal to 1. Therefore, we choose the weight in portfolio  $Q$ ,  $w_Q$ , to satisfy

$$
\beta_ {Q ^ {*}} = w _ {Q} \times \beta_ {Q} + (1 - w _ {Q}) \times \beta_ {\text {b i l l s}} = w _ {Q} \times 1. 2 5 + (1 - w _ {Q}) \times 0 = 1. 0
$$ which implies that  $w_{Q} = .8$ .

Figure 24.3 Treynor measures of two portfolios and the market index

Because the systematic risk of the adjusted portfolio is constructed to match the market's, we can meaningfully compare their returns. The return on  $Q^*$  is  $.8 \times 22 + .2 \times 6 = 18.8\%$ , which beats the market return by  $2.8\%$ . This measure is analogous to the  $M^2$  measure, but it extends the Treynor rather than the Sharpe measure. Therefore, we will call it the  $T$ -square or  $T^2$  measure. The following example computes the  $T^2$  measure for portfolio  $U$ .

# Example 24.2 Equalizing Beta and the  $T^2$  Measure

Portfolio  $U$  has a beta of .8, which is less than the market beta of 1. Therefore, we will need to use leverage to increase systematic risk to match that of the market index. We choose  $w_{U}$  to satisfy:

$$
\beta_ {U ^ {*}} = w _ {U} \times \beta_ {U} + (1 - w _ {U}) \times \beta_ {\text {b i l l s}} = w _ {U} \times . 8 + (1 - w _ {U}) \times 0 = 1. 0
$$ which implies that  $w_U = 1.25$ . So the adjusted portfolio  $U^*$  entails borrowing at the risk-free rate, with all proceeds invested in portfolio  $U$ .


The return on the adjusted portfolio  $U^{*}$  is  $1.25 \times 17 - .25 \times 6 = 19.75\%$ , which beats the market's return by  $3.75\%$ . Portfolio  $U$ 's higher  $T^2$  measure compared to portfolio  $Q$  is consistent with the steeper slope it displayed in Figure 24.3. We can use either the  $T^2$  or the Treynor measure to rank portfolios when beta is the relevant measure of risk.

# The Information Ratio

Here is another situation that calls for yet another performance criterion. Consider a pension fund with a largely passive and well-diversified position—for example, a portfolio that resembles an indexed equity fund. Now the fund decides to add a position in an active portfolio to its current position. For example, a university might employ a hedge fund as a possible addition to its core positions in more traditional portfolios.


As we saw in Chapter 8, when the hedge fund (or another active position) is optimally combined with the baseline indexed portfolio, the improvement in the Sharpe measure will be determined by its information ratio  $\alpha_{H} / \sigma(e_{H})$ , according to

$$
S _ {P} ^ {2} = S _ {M} ^ {2} + \left[ \frac {\alpha_ {H}}{\sigma \left(e _ {H}\right)} \right] ^ {2} \tag {24.2}
$$

Equation 24.2 tells us that if you are looking for active portfolios to add to a currently indexed position, you will want to select candidates with the best information ratios.

The information ratio is yet another version of a reward-to-risk ratio. In this context, the reward is the alpha of the active position. It is the expected return on that incremental portfolio over and above the risk premium that would normally correspond to its systematic risk. On the other hand, the incremental position tilts the total risky portfolio away from the passive index, and therefore exposes it to risk that could, in principle, be diversified. The information ratio quantifies the trade-off between alpha and diversifiable risk.

We can summarize the preceding discussion with the following table, which shows the definition of the various performance measures and the situations in which each is the relevant performance measure.

<table><tr><td>Performance Measure</td><td>Definition</td><td>Application</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Sharpe</td><td>Excess return</td><td rowspan="2">When choosing among portfolios competing for the overall risky portfolio</td></tr><tr><td>Standard deviation</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Treynor</td><td>Excess return</td><td rowspan="2">When ranking many portfolios that will be mixed to form the overall risky portfolio</td></tr><tr><td>Beta</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Information ratio</td><td>Alpha</td><td rowspan="2">When evaluating a portfolio to be mixed with a diversified benchmark portfolio</td></tr><tr><td>Residual standard deviation</td></tr></table>

# The Role of Alpha in Performance Measures

Given the central role of alpha in the index model, the CAPM, and other models of risk versus return, you may be surprised that we have not encountered a situation in which alpha is the criterion used to choose one fund over another. But don't conclude from this that alpha does not matter! With some algebra, we can derive the relationship between the performance measures discussed so far and the alpha of the portfolio. The following table shows these relationships. In all cases, you can see that a positive alpha is necessary to outperform the passive market index. Because superior performance requires positive alpha, it is the most widely used performance measure.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Treynor (Tp)</td><td>Sharpe* (Sp)</td><td>Information Ratio</td></tr><tr><td>Relation to alpha</td><td>E(rp)-rf/βp= αp/βp+TM</td><td>E(rp)-rf/σp= αp/σp+ρSM</td><td>αp/σ(ep)</td></tr><tr><td>Improvement compared to market index</td><td>Tp-TM= αp/βp</td><td>Sp-SM= αp/σp-(1-ρ)SM</td><td>αp/σ(ep)</td></tr></table>

*  $\rho$  denotes the correlation coefficient between portfolio  $P$  and the market, and is less than 1.

The following performance measurement spreadsheet computes all the performance measures discussed in this section. You can see how relative ranking differs according to the criterion selected. This Excel model is available in Connect or through your course instructor.

However, while positive alpha is necessary, it is not sufficient to guarantee that a portfolio will outperform the index: Taking advantage of mispricing means departing from full diversification, which entails a cost in terms of nonsystematic risk. A portfolio can achieve a positive alpha, yet, at the same time, its volatility may increase to a level at which its Sharpe ratio will actually fall.

# Implementing Performance Measurement: An Example

To illustrate some of the calculations underlying portfolio evaluation, let's look at the performance of portfolio  $P$  over the last 12 months. Table 24.2 shows its excess return in each month as well as those of an alternative portfolio  $Q$  and the market index portfolio  $M$ . The bottom two rows in Table 24.2 provide the sample average and standard deviation of each portfolio. From these, and regressions of  $P$  and  $Q$  on  $M$ , we can compute the necessary performance statistics. These appear in Table 24.3.

Table 24.3 shows that portfolio  $Q$  is more aggressive than  $P$ , in the sense that its beta is significantly higher (1.40 versus .70). At the same time,  $P$ 's lower residual standard deviation indicates that it is better diversified than  $Q$  (2.02\% versus 9.81\%). Both portfolios outperformed the benchmark market index, as is evident from their higher Sharpe ratios (and thus positive  $M^2$ ) and their positive alphas.

Which portfolio is more attractive based on reported performance? If  $P$  or  $Q$  represents the entire investment fund,  $Q$  would be preferable on the basis of its higher Sharpe measure (.49 vs. .43) and better  $M^2$  (2.66\% vs. 2.16\%). For the second scenario, where  $P$  and  $Q$  are competing for a role as one of a number of subportfolios,  $Q$  also dominates because

# Table 24.3

Performance statistics its Treynor measure is higher (5.38 vs. 3.97). However, as an active portfolio to be mixed with the index portfolio,  $P$  is preferred because its information ratio  $[\mathrm{IR} = \alpha / \sigma(e)]$  is higher (.81 vs. .54). Thus, the example illustrates that the appropriate way to evaluate a portfolio depends in large part on how the portfolio fits into the investor's overall investment plan.


This analysis is based on only 12 months of data, a period too short to lend statistical significance to the conclusions. Nevertheless, the analysis illustrates what one might wish to do with more extensive data. A model that calculates these performance measures is available in Connect.

# Realized Returns versus Expected Returns

When evaluating a portfolio, the evaluator knows neither the portfolio manager's original expectations nor whether those expectations made sense. One can only observe performance after the fact and hope that the inherent "noise" in investment outcomes does not obscure true underlying ability. To avoid mistaken inferences, we have to determine the "significance level" of a performance measure to know whether it reliably indicates ability.

To illustrate, consider portfolio manager Joe Dart. Suppose that his portfolio has provided an alpha of 20 basis points per month, an impressive  $2.4\%$  per year before compounding. Let us assume that the return distribution of Joe's portfolio has constant mean, beta, and alpha, a heroic assumption, but one that is in line with the usual treatment of performance measurement. Suppose that for the measurement period, Joe's portfolio beta is 1.2 and the monthly standard deviation of the residual (nonsystematic risk) is  $\sigma(e) = .02$  (i.e.,  $2\%$  per month).

To estimate Joe's portfolio alpha from the security characteristic line (SCL), we regress portfolio excess returns on the market index. Suppose that we are in luck and (despite the underlying noise in investment returns) our regression estimates precisely match Joe's true parameters. That means that our SCL estimates for the  $N$  months are

$$
\hat {\alpha} = . 2 \%, \quad \hat {\beta} = 1. 2, \quad \hat {\sigma} (e) = 2 \%
$$

As outside evaluators who run such a regression, however, we do not know the true values. To assess whether the alpha estimate reflects true skill and not just luck due to statistical chance, we compute the  $t$ -statistic of the alpha estimate to determine whether we are justified in rejecting the hypothesis that Joe's true alpha is zero, that is, that he has no superior ability.

The standard error of the alpha estimate in the SCL regression is approximately

$$
\hat {\sigma} (\alpha) = \frac {\hat {\sigma} (e)}{\sqrt {N}}
$$ where  $N$  is the number of observations and  $\hat{\sigma}(e)$  is the sample estimate of nonsystematic risk. The  $t$ -statistic for the estimate of alpha is therefore


$$ t (\hat {\alpha}) = \frac {\hat {\alpha}}{\hat {\sigma} (\alpha)} = \frac {\hat {\alpha} \sqrt {N}}{\hat {\sigma} (e)} \tag {24.3}
$$

Suppose that we require a significance level of  $5\%$  to reject the null hypothesis. With a large number of observations, this requires a  $t(\hat{\alpha})$  value of at least 1.96. With  $\hat{\alpha} = .2$  and  $\hat{\sigma}(e) = 2$ , we solve Equation 24.3 for  $N$  and find that

$$
1. 9 6 = \frac {. 2 \sqrt {N}}{2}
$$

$$
N = 3 8 4 \text {m o n t h s}
$$ or 32 years!


What have we shown? Here is an analyst who has very substantial ability. The example is biased in his favor in the sense that we have assumed away statistical complications. Nothing changes in the parameters over a long period of time. Furthermore, the sample period "behaves" perfectly. Regression estimates are all perfect. Still, it will take Joe's entire working career to get to the point where statistics will confirm his true ability. We have to conclude that even moderate levels of statistical noise make performance evaluation extremely difficult in practice.

Now add to the imprecision of performance estimates the fact that the typical tenure of a fund manager is generally less than five years. By the time you are lucky enough to find a fund whose historic superior performance you are confident of, its manager is likely ready to move, or has already moved elsewhere. The nearby box explores this topic further.

# Concept Check 24.3

Suppose an analyst has a measured alpha of .2\% with a standard error of 2\%, as in our example. What is the probability that the positive alpha is due to luck of the draw and that true ability is zero?

# Should You Follow Your Fund Manager?

The whole idea of investing in a mutual fund is to leave the stock and bond picking to the professionals. But frequently, events don't turn out quite as expected—the manager resigns, gets transferred, or dies. A big part of the investor's decision to buy a managed fund is based on the manager's record, so changes like these can come as an unsettling surprise. However, a manager's real contribution to fund performance is highly overrated.

Funds are promoted on their managers' track records, which normally span a 3- to 5-year period. But performance data that go back only a few years are hardly a valid measure of talent. To be statistically sound, evidence of a manager's track record needs to span, at a minimum, 10 years or more.

The mutual fund industry may look like a merry-go-round of managers, but that shouldn't worry most investors. Many mutual funds are designed to go through little or no change when a manager leaves. That is because, according to a strategy designed to reduce volatility and succession worries, mutual funds are managed by teams of stock pickers, who each runs a portion of the assets, rather than by a solo manager with co-captains. Meanwhile, even so-called star managers are nearly always surrounded by researchers and analysts, who can play as much of a role in performance as the manager who gets the headlines.


Don't underestimate the breadth and depth of a fund company's "managerial bench." The larger, established investment companies generally have a large pool of talent to draw on. They are also well aware that investors are prone to depart from a fund when a managerial change occurs.

Lastly, for investors who worry about management changes, there is a solution: index funds. These mutual funds buy stocks and bonds that track a benchmark index like the S&P 500 rather than relying on star managers to actively pick securities. In this case, it doesn't really matter if the manager leaves. Most importantly, index fund investors are not charged the steep fees that are needed to pay star management salaries.

# Selection Bias and Portfolio Evaluation

A warning: Regardless of the performance criterion, some funds will outperform their benchmarks in any year and some will underperform. The good performers are likely to attract more interest from the financial press and potential investors. But beware of focusing on these above-average performers and extrapolating track records into the future. As we saw in Chapter 11, performance in one period is not predictive of future performance.

When we address the performance of mutual funds selected because they have been successful, we need to be even more cautious in evaluating their track records. In particular, we need to recognize that even if all managers were equally skilled, a few "winners" would emerge by sheer chance each period. With thousands of funds in operation, the best-performing funds will have been wildly successful, even if these results reflect luck rather than skill.

Another manifestation of this sort of selection bias (i.e., a focus on nonrepresentative funds) arises when we limit a sample of funds to those for which returns are available over an entire sample period. This practice implies that we exclude from consideration all funds that were closed down over the sample period. The ensuing bias is called survivorship bias. It turns out that when even a small number of funds have failed, the upward bias in the performance of surviving funds can be substantial. Most mutual fund databases now include failed funds so that samples can be protected from survivorship bias.

# 24.2 Style Analysis

The index model regression can be viewed as a way to characterize a portfolio manager's investment style. Portfolios with high betas are called cyclical or aggressive because they are more responsive to economywide developments. Low-beta portfolios are described as defensive. Multifactor models generalize this idea, describing the portfolio's exposure to several risk factors or segments of the market. Each of these exposures can be viewed as an implicit sort of asset allocation decision.

Style analysis was introduced by William Sharpe as a tool to systematically measure the exposures of managed portfolios. The popularity of the concept was aided by a well-known study concluding that most of the variation in returns of 82 mutual funds could be explained by the funds' asset allocation to bills, bonds, and stocks. While later studies have taken issue with the exact interpretation of these results (see footnote 2 of Chapter 6), there is widespread agreement that asset allocation is responsible for a high proportion of the variation across funds in investment performance.

Sharpe's idea was to regress fund returns on indexes representing a range of asset classes. The regression coefficient on each index would then measure the fund's implicit allocation to that "style." Because funds are barred from short positions, the regression coefficients are constrained to be either zero or positive and to sum to  $100\%$  so as to represent a complete asset allocation. The  $R$ -square of the regression would then measure the percentage of return variability attributable to style choice rather than security selection. The intercept measures the average contribution of security selection to portfolio returns.

To illustrate Sharpe's approach, we use monthly returns on Fidelity's Magellan Fund during the famous manager Peter Lynch's tenure between October 1986 and September 1991, with results shown in Table 24.4. While seven asset classes are included in this analysis (of which six are represented by stock indexes and one is the T-bill alternative), the regression coefficients are positive for only three, namely, large capitalization stocks, medium cap stocks, and high P/E (growth) stocks. These portfolios alone explain  $97.5\%$  of the variance of Magellan's returns. In other words, a tracking portfolio made up of the three style portfolios, with weights as given in Table 24.4, would explain the vast majority of Magellan's variation in monthly performance. We conclude that the fund returns are well represented by three style portfolios.

The proportion of return variability not explained by asset allocation can be attributed to security selection within asset classes, as well as timing that shows up as periodic changes

# Table 24.4

For Magellan, residual variability was  $100 - 97.5 = 2.5\%$ . This sort of result is commonly interpreted as evidence against the importance of security selection, but such a conclusion misses the important role of the intercept in this regression. (The  $R$ -square of the regression can be  $100\%$ , and yet the intercept can be positive due to consistently superior stock selection.) For Magellan, the intercept was 32 basis points per month, providing a cumulative abnormal return over the 5-year period of  $19.19\%$ . The superior performance of Magellan in this period is displayed in Figure 24.4, which plots the combined impact of the intercept plus monthly residuals relative to both the tracking portfolio composed of the individual style portfolios, as well as the CAPM benchmark provided by the SML.

Of course, Magellan's consistently positive residual return (reflected in the steadily increasing plot of cumulative return difference) is hardly common. Figure 24.5 shows the frequency distribution of average residuals across 636 mutual funds. The distribution has the familiar bell shape, but with a slightly negative mean of  $-0.74\%$  per month.

Style analysis has become very popular in the investment management industry and has spawned quite a few variations on Sharpe's methodology. Several Web sites can help investors identify managers' style and stock selection performance.

# 24.3 Performance Measurement with Changing Portfolio Composition

One potential problem with risk-adjustment techniques is that they all assume that portfolio risk, whether measured by standard deviation or beta, is constant over the relevant time period. This isn't necessarily so. If a manager attempts to increase portfolio beta when that manager thinks the market is about to go up and to decrease beta when pessimistic, both the standard deviation and the beta of the portfolio will change over time. This can wreak havoc with our performance measures, as illustrated by the following example.

# Example 24.3 Changing Portfolio Risk

Suppose that the Sharpe measure of the market index is .4. In the first year, the portfolio manager executes a low-risk strategy and realizes an (annualized) mean excess return of  $1\%$  and standard deviation of  $2\%$ . This makes for a Sharpe ratio of .5, which beats the passive strategy. Over the next year, the manager decides that a high-risk strategy is optimal and achieves an annual mean excess return of  $9\%$  and standard deviation of  $18\%$ . Here, again, the Sharpe ratio is .5. Over the 2-year period, our manager consistently maintains a better-than-passive Sharpe measure.

Figure 24.6 shows a pattern of (annualized) quarterly returns that are consistent with our description of the manager's strategy of two years. In the first four quarters, the excess returns are  $-1\%$ ,  $3\%$ ,  $-1\%$ , and  $3\%$ , making for an average of  $1\%$  and standard deviation of  $2\%$ . In the next four quarters, the excess returns are  $-9\%$ ,  $27\%$ ,  $-9\%$ , and  $27\%$ , making for an average of  $9\%$  and standard deviation of  $18\%$ . Thus, both years exhibit a Sharpe measure of .5. However, the mean and standard deviation of the eight quarterly returns are  $5\%$  and  $13.42\%$ , respectively, making for a Sharpe measure of only .37, apparently inferior to the passive strategy!

What happened in Example 24.3? The shift of the mean from the first four quarters to the next was not recognized as a shift in strategy. Instead, the difference in mean returns in the two years added to the appearance of volatility in portfolio returns. The active strategy with shifting means appears riskier than it really is and biases the estimate of the Sharpe measure downward. We conclude that for actively managed portfolios, it is necessary to keep track of portfolio composition and changes in portfolio mean and risk. We will see another example of this problem in Section 24.4, which deals with market timing.


# Performance Manipulation and the Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Rating

We just saw how time-varying risk and return can distort conventional performance evaluation. The problem can be worse when managers, whose compensation depends on performance, try to game the system. Managers observe how returns unfold over the course of the evaluation period and can adjust portfolio strategies (e.g., either increasing or decreasing risk) in an attempt to manipulate performance measures. If they do, portfolio strategy in the latter part of the evaluation period will depend on performance in the beginning of the period.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/36a07d10d8ff7c99eee3078865156cc6f9fdfa16538afcff8135b214e24caecf.jpg)
Figure 24.6 Portfolio returns: Returns in last four quarters are more variable than in the first four

Ingersoll, Spiegel, Goetzmann, and Welch show how the conventional performance measures covered in this chapter can be manipulated. While the details of their model are challenging, the logic is straightforward, and we can illustrate using the Sharpe ratio.

As we saw when analyzing capital allocation (Chapter 6), investment in the risk-free asset (lending or borrowing) does not affect the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio. Put differently, the Sharpe ratio is invariant to the fraction  $y$  invested in the risky portfolio rather than in the risk-free asset. The reason is that realized excess returns are proportional to  $y$  and therefore so are both the risk premium and standard deviation, leaving the Sharpe ratio unchanged. But what if  $y$  changes during a period?

Imagine a manager already partway into an evaluation period. While realized excess returns (average return, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio) are now known for the first part of the evaluation period, the distribution of the remaining future returns is still not determined. The overall Sharpe ratio will be some (complicated) average of the known Sharpe ratio in the first leg and the yet-unknown ratio in the second leg of the evaluation period. Increasing leverage during the second leg will increase the influence of the second period on the full-period average performance because leverage will amplify returns, both good and bad. Therefore, managers will wish to increase leverage in the latter part of the period if early returns are poor. Conversely, good first-part performance calls for deleveraging to increase the weight on the initial period. With an extremely good first leg, a manager will shift almost the entire portfolio to the risk-free asset. This strategy induces a (negative) correlation between returns in the first and second legs of the evaluation period.

Investors lose, on average, from this strategy. Arbitrary variation in leverage (and therefore risk) is utility-reducing. It benefits managers only because it allows them to adjust the implicit weighting scheme of the two subperiods over the full evaluation period after observing their initial performance. Hence, investors would like to eliminate the incentive to pursue this strategy.

Unfortunately, as Ingersoll et al.12 show, only one performance measure is impossible to manipulate. This is the Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Rating (MRAR). Amazingly, Morningstar was not even aiming at a manipulation-proof performance measure when it developed its MRAR—it was simply attempting to accommodate investors who wanted a performance measure consistent with constant relative risk aversion. Its measure is defined as follows:

$$
\text {M o r n i n g s t a r R i s k - A d j u s t e d R a t i n g : M R A R} (\gamma) = \left[ \frac {1}{T} \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \left(\frac {1 + r _ {t}}{1 + r _ {f t}}\right) ^ {- \gamma} \right] ^ {\frac {1 2}{\gamma}} - 1
$$

The rating is a sort of harmonic average of excess returns, where  $t = 1,\dots ,T$  are monthly observations and  $\gamma$  measures investor risk aversion. For mutual funds, Morningstar uses  $\gamma = 2$ , which it considers a reasonable value for an average retail client. The MRAR can be interpreted as the risk-free equivalent excess return of the portfolio for an investor with risk aversion measured by  $\gamma$ .

The Morningstar RAR method produces results that are similar but not identical to those of the mean/variance-based Sharpe ratio. Figure 24.7 demonstrates the fit between ranking by MRAR and by Sharpe ratios from the performance of 1,286 diversified equity funds over the period 1994-1996. Sharpe notes that this period is characterized by high returns that contribute to a good fit.

Morningstar also computes fund returns adjusted for both loads as well as a risk measure based on fund performance in its worst years. Morningstar ranks risk-adjusted performance

12 Ibid.

The MRAR measure is the certainty-equivalent geometric average excess return derived from a utility function consistent with constant relative risk aversion (CRRA). Under CRRA, capital allocation (the fraction of the portfolio placed in risk-free versus risky assets) does not change with wealth. The coefficient of risk aversion is  $A = 1 + \gamma$ . When  $\gamma = 0$  (equivalently,  $A = 1$ ), the utility function is just the geometric average of gross excess returns:

$$
\operatorname {M R A R} (0) = \left[ \prod_ {t = 1} ^ {T} \left(1 + R _ {t}\right) \right] ^ {\frac {1 2}{T}} - 1
$$ across funds in a similar style group. The peer group for each fund is selected on the basis of the fund's investment universe (e.g., international, growth versus value, fixed-income) as well as portfolio characteristics such as average price-to-book ratio, price-earnings ratio, and market capitalization, and stars are awarded based on the following table:


<table><tr><td>Percentile</td><td>Stars</td></tr><tr><td>0–10</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>10–32.5</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>32.5–67.5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>67.5–90</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>90–100</td><td>5</td></tr></table>

The Morningstar five-star rating is coveted by the managers of the thousands of funds covered by the service.

# 24.4 Market Timing

Another source of variation in portfolio risk is market timing. In its pure form, market timing involves shifting funds between a market-index portfolio and a safe asset, depending on whether the index is expected to outperform the safe asset. In practice, most managers do not shift fully between T-bills and the market. How can we account for partial shifts into the market when it is expected to perform well?

To simplify, suppose that an investor holds only the market-index portfolio and T-bills. If the weight of the market were constant, say, .6, then portfolio beta would also be constant, and the SCL would plot as a straight line with slope .6, as in Figure 24.8, Panel A. If, however, the investor could correctly time the market and shift funds into it in periods when the market does well, the SCL would plot as in Figure 24.8, Panel B. If bull and bear markets can be (at least partially) predicted, the investor will shift more into the market when it is more likely to go up. The portfolio beta and the slope of the SCL therefore will be higher when  $r_M$  is higher, resulting in the curved line that appears in Figure 24.8, Panel B.

Treynor and Mazuy were the first to propose estimating such a line by adding a squared term to the usual linear index model:

$$ r _ {P} - r _ {f} = a + b \left(r _ {M} - r _ {f}\right) + c \left(r _ {M} - r _ {f}\right) ^ {2} + e _ {P}
$$ where  $r_P$  is the portfolio return and  $a, b,$  and  $c$  are estimated by regression analysis. If  $c$  turns out to be positive, we have evidence of timing ability because this last term will make the characteristic line steeper as  $r_M - r_f$  is larger. Treynor and Mazuy estimated this equation for a number of mutual funds but found little evidence of timing ability.


A similar but simpler methodology was proposed by Henriksson and Merton.[15] They assume that the beta of the portfolio takes only two values: a large value if the market is expected to do well and a small value otherwise. Under this scheme, the portfolio characteristic line appears as shown in Figure 24.8, Panel C. Such a line appears in regression form as

$$ r _ {P} - r _ {f} = a + b (r _ {M} - r _ {f}) + c (r _ {M} - r _ {f}) D + e _ {P}
$$

Figure 24.8 Characteristic lines. Panel A: No market timing, beta is constant.
Panel B: Market timing, beta increases with expected market excess return.
Panel C: Market timing with only two values of beta where  $D$  is a dummy variable that equals 1 when  $r_M > r_f$  and zero otherwise. Hence, the beta of the portfolio is  $b$  in bear markets and  $b + c$  in bull markets. Again, a positive value of  $c$  implies market timing ability. They also found little evidence of market timing ability.


To illustrate how you might implement a test for market timing, return to Table 24.2, which contains 12 months of excess returns for two managed portfolios,  $P$  and  $Q$ , and the market index,  $M$ . Regress the excess returns of each portfolio on the excess returns of  $M$  and the square of these excess returns as in the following specifications:

$$ r _ {P} - r _ {f} = a _ {P} + b _ {P} \left(r _ {M} - r _ {f}\right) + c _ {P} \left(r _ {M} - r _ {f}\right) ^ {2} + e _ {P}
$$

$$ r _ {Q} - r _ {f} = a _ {Q} + b _ {Q} (r _ {M} - r _ {f}) + c _ {Q} (r _ {M} - r _ {f}) ^ {2} + e _ {Q}
$$

You will derive the following statistics. The numbers in parentheses are included for comparison: They are the regression estimates from the single-variable regression reported in Table 24.3.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Estimate</td><td colspan="2">Portfolio</td></tr><tr><td>P</td><td>Q</td></tr><tr><td>Alpha (a)</td><td>1.77 (1.63)</td><td>-2.29 (5.26)</td></tr><tr><td>Beta (b)</td><td>0.70 (0.70)</td><td>1.10 (1.40)</td></tr><tr><td>Timing (c)</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>R-square</td><td>0.91 (0.91)</td><td>0.98 (0.64)</td></tr></table>

Portfolio  $P$  shows no evidence of attempted timing: Its timing coefficient,  $c$ , is estimated to be zero. It is not clear whether this is because no attempt was made at timing or because any effort to time the market was in vain and served only to increase portfolio variance unnecessarily.

The results for portfolio  $Q$ , however, reveal that timing has, in all likelihood, been attempted. Here the coefficient,  $c$ , is positive, with an estimated value of .10. The evidence thus suggests successful timing, offset by unsuccessful stock selection (negative  $a$ ). Notice that the estimate of alpha,  $a$ , is now  $-2.29\%$ , as opposed to the 5.26\% estimate derived from the regression equation that did not account for the potential impact of timing.

This example illustrates the inadequacy of conventional performance evaluation techniques that assume constant mean returns and constant risk. The market timer constantly shifts beta and mean return, moving into and out of the market. So market timing presents another instance in which portfolio composition and risk change over time, complicating the effort to evaluate performance. Whereas the expanded regression captures this possibility, the simple SCL does not. The important point for performance evaluation is that failing to account for variation in portfolio composition can confound more conventional mean-variance measures.

# The Potential Value of Market Timing

Suppose we define perfect market timing as the ability to tell (with certainty) at the beginning of each year whether the S&P 500 portfolio will outperform Treasury bills. Accordingly, at the beginning of each year, the market timer shifts all funds into either cash equivalents (T-bills) or equities (the S&P portfolio), whichever is predicted to do better. Beginning with 1 on December 31, 1926, how would the perfect timer end a 95-year experiment on December 31, 2021, in comparison with investors who kept their funds in either equity or T-bills for the entire period?

Table 24.5 presents summary statistics for each of the three passive strategies, computed from the historical annual returns of bills and equities. From the returns on stocks and bills, we calculate wealth indexes of the all-bills and all-equity investments and show terminal values for these investors at the end of 2021. The return for the perfect timer in each year is the maximum of the return on stocks and the return on bills.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Bills</td><td>Equities</td><td>Perfect timer</td></tr><tr><td>Terminal value</td><td>$21</td><td>$10,546</td><td>1,512,355</td></tr><tr><td>Arithmetic average</td><td>3.31\%</td><td>11.96\%</td><td>16.72\%</td></tr><tr><td>Standard deviation</td><td>3.12\%</td><td>19.89\%</td><td>13.34\%</td></tr><tr><td>Geometric average</td><td>3.26\%</td><td>10.24\%</td><td>16.16\%</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum</td><td>14.71\%</td><td>57.35\%</td><td>57.35\%</td></tr><tr><td>Minimum*</td><td>-0.02\%</td><td>-44.04\%</td><td>0.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Skew</td><td>1.08</td><td>-0.45</td><td>0.69</td></tr><tr><td>Kurtosis</td><td>1.09</td><td>0.11</td><td>-0.14</td></tr><tr><td>LPSD</td><td>0</td><td>12.80\%</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

*A negative rate on "bills" was observed in 1940. The Treasury security used in the data series in these early years was actually not a T-bill but a T-bond with 30 days to maturity.

# Table 24.5

Performance of bills, equities, and perfect (annual) market timers. Initial investment  $= \$  1$

The first row in Table 24.5 shows the terminal value of investing  \$1 in bills over the 95 years (1927-2021) is\$ 21, while the terminal value of the same initial investment in equities is 10,546. We pointed out in Chapter 5 that as impressive as the difference in terminal values is, it is best interpreted as no more than compensation for the risk borne by equity investors. As we've already seen, the annual difference in returns is just about 8.6\%, which doesn't seem as dramatic. Notice that the standard deviation of the all-equity investor was a hefty 19.89\%.

Now observe that the terminal value of the perfect timer is 1.51 million, a 143-fold increase over the already large terminal value of the all-equity strategy! In fact, this result is even better than it looks because the return to the market timer is truly risk-free. This is the classic case where a large standard deviation (13.34\%) has nothing to do with risk. Because the timer never delivers a return below the risk-free rate, the standard deviation is a measure of good surprises only.

The positive skew of the timer's distribution (.69, compared with the negative skew of equities) is a manifestation of the fact that the extreme values are all positive. Other indications of this stellar performance are the minimum and maximum returns—the minimum return for the timer equals zero (in 1940) and the maximum return,  $57.35\%$ , is that of equities (in 1933). All negative returns on equities (as low as  $-44\%$  in 1931) were avoided by the timer. Finally, another clear indication of the advantage of the perfect timer compared to the all-equity portfolio is provided by the lower partial standard deviation, LPSD. $^{16}$  The LPSD, which is a measure of the typical amplitude of any return shortfall compared to T-bills, is  $12.8\%$  for the all-equity portfolio, but it is necessarily zero for the perfect timer (who always performs at least as well as bills).

Figure 24.9 Rate of return of a perfect market timer as a function of the rate of return on the market index

# Valuing Market Timing as a Call Option

The key to valuing market timing ability is to recognize that perfect foresight is equivalent to holding a call option on the equity portfolio—but without having to pay for it! The perfect timer invests  $100\%$  in either the safe asset or the equity portfolio, whichever will provide the higher return. The rate of return is at least the risk-free rate. This is shown in Figure 24.9.

To see how timing skill can be viewed as a free option, suppose that the market index currently is at  $S_0$  and that a call option on the index has an exercise price of  $X = S_0(1 + r_f)$ . If the market outperforms bills over the coming period,  $S_T$  will exceed  $X$ ; otherwise it will be less than  $X$ . Now look at the payoff to a portfolio consisting of this option and  $S_0$  dollars invested in bills:

<table><tr><td></td><td>ST&lt;X</td><td>ST≥X</td></tr><tr><td>Bills</td><td>SO(1 + r_f)</td><td>SO(1 + r_f)</td></tr><tr><td>Call</td><td>0</td><td>ST-X</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>SO(1 + r_f)</td><td>ST</td></tr></table>

The portfolio pays the risk-free return when the market is bearish (i.e., the market return is less than the risk-free rate), and it pays the market return when the market is bullish and outperforms bills. Such a portfolio is a perfect market timer.[17]

Because the ability to predict the better-performing investment is equivalent to acquiring a (free) call option on the market, we can use option-pricing models to value it. This value would constitute the fee that a perfect timer could charge investors for its services. Placing a value on perfect timing will also allow us to assign value to less-than-perfect timers.

The exercise price of the perfect-timer call option on  \$1 of the equity portfolio is the final value of the T-bill investment. Using continuous compounding, this is$ 1 × e $^{rT}$ . When you use this exercise price in the Black-Scholes formula for the value of the call option, the formula simplifies considerably to $^{18}$

$$
\operatorname {M V} (\text {P e r f e c t t i m e r p e r $}  of assets) = C = 2 N \left(1 / 2 \sigma_ {M} \sqrt {T}\right) - 1 \tag{24.4}
$$

We have so far assumed annual forecasts, that is,  $T = 1$  year. Using  $T = 1$ , and the standard deviation of stocks from Table 24.5,  $19.89\%$ , we compute the value of this call option as 7.92 cents, or  $7.92\%$  of the value of the equity portfolio.[19]

# The Value of Imperfect Forecasting

A weather forecaster in Tucson, Arizona, who always predicts no rain may be right more than  $90\%$  of the time. But a high success rate for a "stopped-clock" strategy is not evidence of forecasting ability. Similarly, the appropriate measure of market forecasting ability is not the overall proportion of correct forecasts. If the market is up two days out of three and a forecaster always predicts market advance, the resulting two-thirds success rate does not imply forecasting ability. We need to examine the proportion of bull markets  $(r_M > r_f)$  correctly forecast and the proportion of bear markets  $(r_M < r_f)$  correctly forecast.

If we call  $P_{1}$  the proportion of the correct forecasts of bull markets and  $P_{2}$  the proportion for bear markets, then  $P_{1} + P_{2} - 1$  is the correct measure of timing ability. For example, a forecaster who always guesses correctly will have  $P_{1} = P_{2} = 1$ , and will show ability of  $P_{1} + P_{2} - 1 = 1$  (100\%). An analyst who always bets on a bear market will mispredict all bull markets ( $P_{1} = 0$ ), will correctly "predict" all bear markets ( $P_{2} = 1$ ), and will end up with timing ability of  $P_{1} + P_{2} - 1 = 0$ .

# Concept Check 24.4

What is the market timing score of someone who flips a fair coin to predict the market?

Merton shows that the value of imperfect market timing equals the value of the perfect-timing call option times our measure of timing ability,  $P_{1} + P_{2} - 1$ .

$\mathrm{MV}(\text{Imperfect timer}) = (P_1 + P_2 - 1) \times C = (P_1 + P_2 - 1)[2N(\frac{1}{2}\sigma_M\sqrt{T}) - 1]$  (24.5)

The incredible potential payoff to accurate timing versus the relative scarcity of billionaires suggests that market timing is far from a trivial exercise and that very imperfect timing is the most that we can hope for.

# 24.5 Performance Attribution Procedures

Rather than focus on risk-adjusted returns, practitioners often want simply to ascertain which decisions resulted in superior or inferior performance. Superior investment performance depends on an ability to be in the "right" securities at the right time. Such timing and selection ability may be considered broadly, such as being in equities as opposed to fixed-income securities when the stock market is performing well. Or it may be defined at a more detailed level, such as choosing the relatively better-performing stocks within a particular industry.

Portfolio managers continually make broad-brush asset allocation decisions as well as more detailed sector and security allocation decisions within asset classes. Performance attribution studies attempt to decompose overall performance into discrete components that may be identified with a particular level of the portfolio selection process.

Attribution analysis starts from the broadest asset allocation choices and progressively focuses on ever-finer details of portfolio choice. The difference between a managed portfolio's performance and that of a benchmark portfolio then may be expressed as the sum of the contributions to performance of a series of decisions made at the various levels of the portfolio construction process. For example, one common attribution system decomposes performance into three components: (1) broad asset market allocation choices across equity, fixed-income, and money markets; (2) industry (sector) choice within each market; and (3) security choice within each sector.

The attribution method explains the difference in returns between a managed portfolio,  $P$ , and a selected benchmark portfolio,  $B$ , called the bogey. The bogey measures the returns the portfolio manager would earn following a completely passive strategy. "Passive" in this context has two attributes. First, it means that the allocation of funds across broad asset classes is consistent with the "usual," or neutral, allocation across sectors. This would be considered a passive asset-market allocation. Second, it means that within each asset class, the portfolio manager holds an indexed portfolio, such as the S&P 500 index for the equity sector. In such a manner, the passive strategy used as a performance benchmark rules out asset allocation as well as security selection decisions. Any departure of the manager's return from the passive benchmark must be due to either asset allocation bets (departures from the neutral allocation across markets) or security selection bets (departures from the passive index within asset classes).


While we have discussed in earlier chapters the justification for indexing within sectors, it is worth briefly explaining the determination of the neutral allocation of funds across the broad asset classes. Weights that are designated as "neutral" will depend on the risk tolerance of the investor and must be determined in consultation with the client. For example, risk-tolerant clients may place a large fraction of their portfolio in the equity market, perhaps directing the fund manager to set neutral weights of  $75\%$  equity,  $15\%$  bonds, and  $10\%$  cash equivalents. Any deviation from these weights must be justified by a belief that one or another market will either over- or underperform its usual risk-return profile. In contrast, more risk-averse clients may set neutral weights of  $45\%/35\%/20\%$  for the three markets. Therefore, their portfolios in normal circumstances will be exposed to less risk than that of the risk-tolerant client. Only intentional bets on market performance will result in departures from this profile.

To illustrate, consider the attribution results for a hypothetical portfolio. The portfolio invests in stocks, bonds, and money market securities. An attribution analysis appears in Tables 24.6 through 24.9. The portfolio return over the month is  $5.34\%$ .

In Table 24.6, the neutral weights have been set at  $60\%$  equity,  $30\%$  fixed income, and  $10\%$  cash (money market securities). The bogey portfolio, comprised of investments in each index with the  $60/30/10$  weights, returned  $3.97\%$ . The managed portfolio's measure of performance is positive and equal to its actual return less the return of the bogey:  $5.34 - 3.97 = 1.37\%$ . The next step is to allocate the  $1.37\%$  excess return to the separate decisions that contributed to it.

# Asset Allocation Decisions

Table 24.7 shows that in this month, the manager established asset allocation weights of  $70\%$  in equity,  $7\%$  in fixed income, and  $23\%$  in cash equivalents. To isolate the effect of this departure from neutral asset allocation, we compare the performance of a hypothetical portfolio that would have been invested in a passive index for each market with weights 70/7/23 versus one invested in each index using the benchmark 60/30/10 weights.

Superior performance relative to the bogey is achieved by weighting investments in markets that turn out to perform well and by underweighting those in poorly performing markets. The contribution of asset allocation to superior performance equals the sum over all markets of the excess weight (sometimes called the active weight in the industry) in each market times the return of the index for that market.

Panel A of Table 24.7 demonstrates that asset allocation contributed 31 basis points to the portfolio's overall excess return of 137 basis points. The major factor contributing to superior performance in this month is the heavy weighting of the equity market in a month when it had an excellent return of  $5.81\%$ .

# Sector and Security Selection Decisions

If .31\% of the excess performance (Table 24.7, Panel A) can be attributed to advantageous asset allocation across markets, the remaining 1.06\% must be attributable to sector selection and security selection within each market. Table 24.7, Panel B, details the contribution of the managed portfolio's sector and security selection to total performance.

Panel B shows that the equity component of the managed portfolio has a return of  $7.28\%$  versus a return of  $5.81\%$  for the S&P 500. The fixed-income return is  $1.89\%$  versus  $1.45\%$  for the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index. The superior performance in both equity and fixed-income markets weighted by the portfolio proportions invested in each market sums to the  $1.06\%$  contribution to performance attributable to sector and security selection.

Table 24.8 documents the decisions that led to the superior equity market performance. The first three columns detail the allocation of funds within the equity market compared

# Table 24.8

Sector selection within the equity market to their representation in the S&P 500. Column (4) shows the rate of return of each sector. The contribution of each sector's allocation presented in column (5) equals the product of the difference in the sector weight and the sector's performance.


Good performance (a positive contribution) derives from overweighting well-performing sectors such as consumer noncyclicals. The excess return of the equity component of the portfolio attributable to sector allocation alone is  $1.29\%$ . Table 24.7, Panel B, column (3), shows that the equity component of the portfolio outperformed the S&P 500 by  $1.47\%$ . We conclude that the effect of security selection within sectors must have contributed an additional  $1.47\% - 1.29\%$ , or  $0.18\%$ , to the performance of the equity component of the portfolio.

A similar sector analysis can be applied to the fixed-income portion of the portfolio, but we do not show those results here.

# Summing Up Component Contributions

In this particular month, all facets of the portfolio selection process were successful. Table 24.9 details the contribution of each aspect of performance. Asset allocation across the major security markets contributes 31 basis points. Sector and security allocation within those markets contributes 106 basis points, for total excess portfolio performance of 137 basis points.

The sector and security allocation of 106 basis points can be partitioned further. Sector allocation within the equity market results in excess performance of 129 basis points, and security selection within sectors contributes 18 basis points. (The total equity excess performance of 147 basis points is multiplied by the  $70\%$  weight in equity to obtain contribution to portfolio performance.) Similar partitioning could be done for the fixed-income sector.

1. The simplest performance measure compares average return to that on a benchmark such as an appropriate market index or even the median return of funds in a comparison universe. Alternative measures of the average return include the arithmetic and geometric average and time-weighted versus dollar-weighted returns.
2. The appropriate performance measure depends on the role of the portfolio to be evaluated. Appropriate performance measures are as follows: a. Sharpe: When the portfolio represents the entire investment fund.

$b$ . Information ratio: When the portfolio is an active portfolio to be optimally mixed with the passive portfolio.
c. Treynor: When the portfolio is one subportfolio of many.
d. Jensen (alpha): All of these measures require a positive alpha for the portfolio to be considered attractive.

3. Many observations and long sample periods are required to eliminate the effect of the "luck of the draw" from the evaluation process because portfolio returns commonly are very noisy.
4. Style analysis uses a multiple regression model where the factors are category (style) portfolios such as bills, bonds, and stocks. The coefficients on the style portfolios indicate a passive strategy that would match the risk exposures of the managed portfolio. The return difference between the managed portfolio and the matching portfolio measures performance relative to similar-style funds.
5. Shifting mean and risk of actively managed portfolios makes it difficult to assess performance. An important example of this problem arises when portfolio managers attempt to time the market, resulting in ever-changing portfolio betas.
6. One way to measure timing and selection success simultaneously is to estimate an expanded security characteristic line, for which the slope (beta) coefficient is allowed to increase as the market return increases. Another way to evaluate timers is based on the implicit call option embedded in their performance.
7. Common attribution procedures decompose portfolio performance to asset allocation, sector selection, and security selection decisions. Performance is assessed by calculating departures of portfolio composition from a benchmark or neutral portfolio.

The difference in rankings for Funds  $A$  and  $D$  is most likely due to:

$a$ . A lack of diversification in Fund  $A$  as compared to Fund  $D$ .
$b$ . Different benchmarks used to evaluate each fund's performance.
c. A difference in risk premiums.

Use the following information to answer Problems 17 through 20: Primo Management Co. is looking at how best to use benchmarks to evaluate the performance of its managers. The company has hired Sally Jones, CFA, to educate the managers on the best methods for constructing a benchmark portfolio, how to choose the best benchmark, whether the style of the fund under management matters, and what they should do with their global funds in terms of benchmarking.

Jones put together some 2-year performance numbers comparing Primo's current domestic funds to a potential benchmark.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Style Category</td><td colspan="2">Weight</td><td colspan="2">Return</td></tr><tr><td>Primo</td><td>Benchmark</td><td>Primo</td><td>Benchmark</td></tr><tr><td>Large-cap growth</td><td>0.60</td><td>0.50</td><td>17\%</td><td>16\%</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-cap growth</td><td>0.15</td><td>0.40</td><td>24</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Small-cap growth</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.10</td><td>20</td><td>18</td></tr></table>

As part of her analysis, Jones also takes a look at one of Primo's global funds. In this particular portfolio, Primo is invested  $75\%$  in Dutch stocks and  $25\%$  in British stocks. The benchmark is invested  $50\%$  in Dutch stocks and  $50\%$  in British stocks. On average, the British stocks outperformed the Dutch stocks. The euro appreciated  $6\%$  versus the U.S. dollar over the holding period while the pound depreciated  $2\%$  versus the dollar. In terms of the local return, Primo outperformed the benchmark with the Dutch investments but underperformed the index with respect to the British stocks.

21. Kelli Blakely is a portfolio manager for the Miranda Fund, a core large-cap equity fund. The benchmark for performance measurement purposes is the S&P 500. Although the Miranda portfolio generally mirrors the asset class and sector weightings of the S&P, Blakely is allowed a significant amount of leeway in managing the fund.

Blakely was able to produce exceptional returns last year (as outlined in the table below) through her market timing and security selection skills. At the outset of the year, she became extremely concerned that the combination of a weak economy and geopolitical uncertainties would negatively impact the market. Taking a bold step, she changed her market allocation. For the entire year her asset class exposures averaged  $50\%$  in stocks and  $50\%$  in cash. The S&P's allocation between stocks and cash during the period was a constant  $97\%$  and  $3\%$ , respectively. The risk-free rate of return was  $2\%$ .

1. You and a prospective client are considering the measurement of investment performance, particularly with respect to international portfolios for the past five years. The data you discussed are presented in the following table:

<table><tr><td>International Manager or Index</td><td>Total Return</td><td>Country and Security Return</td><td>Currency Return</td></tr><tr><td>Manager A</td><td>-6.0\%</td><td>2.0\%</td><td>-8.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>Manager B</td><td>-2.0</td><td>-1.0</td><td>-1.0</td></tr><tr><td>International Index</td><td>-5.0</td><td>0.2</td><td>-5.2</td></tr></table> a. Assume that the sample results for manager A and manager B accurately reflect their investment skills and that both managers actively manage currency exposure. Briefly describe one strength and one weakness for each manager.

b. Recommend and justify a strategy that would enable your fund to take advantage of the strengths of each of the two managers while minimizing their weaknesses.

2. Carl Karl, a portfolio manager for the Alpine Trust Company, has been responsible since 2025 for the City of Alpine's Employee Retirement Plan, a municipal pension fund. Alpine is a growing community, and city services and employee payrolls have expanded in each of the past 10 years. Contributions to the plan in fiscal 2030 exceeded benefit payments by a three-to-one ratio.

The plan board of trustees directed Karl five years ago to invest for total return over the long term. However, as trustees of this highly visible public fund, they cautioned him that volatile or erratic results could cause them embarrassment. They also noted a state statute that mandated that not more than  $25\%$  of the plan's assets (at cost) be invested in common stocks.

At the annual meeting of the trustees in November 2030, Karl presented the following portfolio and performance report to the board:

Alpine Employee Retirement Plan

<table><tr><td>Asset Mix as of 9/30/2030</td><td colspan="2">At Cost (millions)</td><td colspan="2">At Market (millions)</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed-income assets:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Short-term securities</td><td>$ 4.5</td><td>11.0\%</td><td>$ 4.5</td><td>11.4\%</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term bonds and mortgages</td><td>26.5</td><td>64.7</td><td>23.5</td><td>59.5</td></tr><tr><td>Common stocks</td><td>10.0</td><td>24.3</td><td>11.5</td><td>29.1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$41.0</td><td>100.0\%</td><td>$39.5</td><td>100.0\%</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Annual Rates of Return for Periods Ending 9/30/2030</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>5 Years</td><td>1 Year</td></tr><tr><td>Total Alpine Fund:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Time-weighted</td><td>8.2\%</td><td>5.2\%</td></tr><tr><td>Dollar-weighted (internal)</td><td>7.7\%</td><td>4.8\%</td></tr><tr><td>Assumed actuarial return</td><td>6.0\%</td><td>6.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>U.S. Treasury bills</td><td>7.5\%</td><td>11.3\%</td></tr><tr><td>Large sample of pension funds (average 60\% equities, 40\% fixed income)</td><td>10.1\%</td><td>14.3\%</td></tr><tr><td>Common stocks—Alpine Fund</td><td>13.3\%</td><td>14.3\%</td></tr><tr><td>Alpine portfolio beta coefficient</td><td>0.90</td><td>0.89</td></tr><tr><td>Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s 500 stock index</td><td>13.8\%</td><td>21.1\%</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed-income securities—Alpine Fund</td><td>6.7\%</td><td>1.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>Broad Investment Grade bond index</td><td>4.0\%</td><td>-11.4\%</td></tr></table>

Karl was proud of his performance and was chagrined when a trustee made the following critical observations: a. "Our 1-year results were terrible, and it's what you've done for us lately that counts most."

b. "Our total fund performance was clearly inferior compared to the large sample of other pension funds for the last five years. What else could this reflect except poor management judgment?"
c. "Our common stock performance was especially poor for the 5-year period."
d. "Why bother to compare your returns to the return from Treasury bills and the actuarial assumption rate? What your competition could have earned for us or how we would have fared if invested in a passive index (which doesn't charge a fee) are the only relevant measures of performance."
e. "Who cares about time-weighted return? If it can't pay pensions, what good is it?"

Appraise the merits of each of these statements and give counterarguments that Mr. Karl can use.

3. The Retired Fund is an open-ended mutual fund composed of 500 million in U.S. bonds and U.S. Treasury bills. This fund has had a portfolio duration (including T-bills) of between three and nine years. Retired has shown first-quartile performance over the past five years, as measured by an independent fixed-income measurement service. However, the directors of the fund would like to measure the market timing skill of the fund's sole bond investor manager. An external consulting firm has suggested the following three methods: a. Method I examines the value of the bond portfolio at the beginning of every year, then calculates the return that would have been achieved had that same portfolio been held throughout the year. This return would then be compared with the return actually obtained by the fund.

b. Method II calculates the average weighting of the portfolio in bonds and T-bills for each year. Instead of using the actual bond portfolio, the return on a long-bond market index and T-bill index would be used. For example, if the portfolio on average was  $65\%$  in bonds and  $35\%$  in T-bills, the annual return on a portfolio invested  $65\%$  in a long-bond index and  $35\%$  in T-bills would be calculated. This return is compared with the annual return that would have been generated using the indexes and the manager's actual bond/T-bill weighting for each quarter of the year.
c. Method III examines the net bond purchase activity (market value of purchases less sales) for each quarter of the year. If net purchases were positive (negative) in any quarter, the performance of the bonds would be evaluated until the net purchase activity became negative (positive). Positive (negative) net purchases would be viewed as a bullish (bearish) view taken by the manager. The correctness of this view would be measured.

Critique each method with regard to market timing measurement problems.

Use the following data to solve CFA Problems 4 and 5: The administrator of a large pension fund wants to evaluate the performance of four portfolio managers. Each portfolio manager invests only in U.S. common stocks. Assume that during the most recent 5-year period, the average annual total rate of return including dividends on the S&P 500 was  $8\%$ , and the average nominal rate of return on government Treasury bills was  $2\%$ . The following table shows risk and return measures for each portfolio:

<table><tr><td>Portfolio</td><td>Average Annual Rate of Return</td><td>Standard Deviation</td><td>Beta</td></tr><tr><td>P</td><td>11\%</td><td>20\%</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>2.1</td></tr><tr><td>R</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>S</td><td>10</td><td>14</td><td>1.5</td></tr><tr><td>S&amp;P 500</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>1.0</td></tr></table>

4. What is the Treynor performance measure for portfolio  $P$ ?
5. What is the Sharpe performance measure for portfolio  $Q$ ?
6. An analyst wants to evaluate portfolio  $X$ , consisting entirely of U.S. common stocks, using both the Treynor and Sharpe measures of portfolio performance. The following table provides the average annual rate of return for portfolio  $X$ , the market portfolio (as measured by the S&P 500), and U.S. Treasury bills during the past eight years:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Average Annual Rate of Return</td><td>Standard Deviation of Return</td><td>Beta</td></tr><tr><td>Portfolio X</td><td>6\%</td><td>18\%</td><td>0.60</td></tr><tr><td>S&amp;P 500</td><td>8</td><td>13</td><td>1.00</td></tr><tr><td>T-bills</td><td>2</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr></table> a. Calculate the Treynor and Sharpe measures for both portfolio  $X$  and the S&P 500. Briefly explain whether portfolio  $X$  underperformed, equaled, or outperformed the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis using both the Treynor measure and the Sharpe ratio.

b. On the basis of the performance of portfolio  $X$  relative to the S&P 500 calculated in part (a), briefly explain the reason for the conflicting results when using the Treynor measure versus the Sharpe ratio.

7. Assume you invested in an asset for two years. The first year you earned a  $15\%$  return, and the second year you earned a negative  $10\%$  return. What was your annual geometric return?
8. A portfolio of stocks generates a  $-9\%$  return in 2020, a  $23\%$  return in 2021, and a  $17\%$  return in 2022. What was the annualized return (geometric mean) for the entire period?
 9. A 2-year investment of \$2,000 results in a cash flow of \$150 at the end of the first year and another cash flow of 150 at the end of the second year, in addition to the return of the original investment. What is the dollar-weighted (internal) rate of return on the investment?
10. In measuring the performance of a portfolio, the time-weighted rate of return may be preferred to the dollar-weighted rate of return because:

$a$ . When the rate of return varies, the time-weighted return is higher.
$b$ . The dollar-weighted return assumes all portfolio deposits are made on day 1.
$c$ . The dollar-weighted return can only be estimated.
$d$ . The time-weighted return is unaffected by the timing of portfolio contributions and withdrawals.

11. A pension fund portfolio begins with \$500,000 and earns 15\% the first year and 10\% the second year. At the beginning of the second year, the sponsor contributes another \$500,000. What were the time-weighted and dollar-weighted rates of return?
12. During the annual review of Acme's pension plan, several trustees questioned their investment consultant about various aspects of performance measurement and risk assessment.

a. Comment on the appropriateness of using each of the following benchmarks for performance evaluation:

Market index.
Benchmark normal portfolio.
- Median of the manager universe.

b. Distinguish among the following performance measures:

The Sharpe ratio.
- The Treynor measure.
Jensen's alpha.

i. Describe how each of the three performance measures is calculated.
ii. State whether each measure assumes that the relevant risk is systematic, unsystematic, or total. Explain how each measure relates excess return and the relevant risk.

13. Trustees of the Pallor Corp. pension plan ask consultant Donald Millip to comment on the following statements. What should his response be?

a. Median manager benchmarks are statistically unbiased measures of performance over long periods of time.
b. Median manager benchmarks are unambiguous and are therefore easily replicated by managers wishing to adopt a passive/indexed approach.
c. Median manager benchmarks are not appropriate in all circumstances because the median manager universe encompasses non-uniform investment styles.

14. James Chan is reviewing the performance of the global equity managers of the Jarvis University endowment fund. Williamson Capital is currently the endowment fund's only large-capitalization global equity manager. Performance data for Williamson Capital are shown in Table 24A.


Chan also presents the endowment fund's investment committee with performance information for Joyner Asset Management, which is another large-capitalization global equity manager. Performance data for Joyner Asset Management are shown in Table 24B. Performance data for the relevant risk-free asset and market index are shown in Table 24C.

a. Calculate the Sharpe ratio and Treynor measure for both Williamson Capital and Joyner Asset Management.
$b$ . The investment committee notices that using the Sharpe ratio versus the Treynor measure produces different performance rankings of Williamson and Joyner. Explain why these criteria may result in different rankings.

Cash Flow

0 Buy two shares -40

1 Collect dividends; then sell one of the shares  $4 + 22$

2 Collect dividend on remaining share, then sell it  $2 + 19$ a. Dollar-weighted return:


$$
\begin{array}{l} - 4 0 + \frac {2 6}{1 + r} + \frac {2 1}{(1 + r) ^ {2}} = 0 \\ r = .1191, \text{or} 11.91\% \\ \end{array}
$$

$b$ . Time-weighted return:

The rates of return on the stock in the two years were:

$$
\begin{array}{l} r _ {1} = \frac {2 + (2 2 - 2 0)}{2 0} = . 2 0 \\ r _ {2} = \frac {2 + (1 9 - 2 2)}{2 2} = -. 0 4 5 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

Arithmetic time-weighted return:  $(r_1 + r_2) / 2 = .0773$ , or  $7.73\%$

Geometric time-weighted return:  $\left[(1 + r_1)(1 + r_2)\right]^{1 / 2} - 1 = .0702 = 7.02\%$

2. Sharpe:  $(\overline{r} -\overline{r}_f) / \sigma$

$$
\begin{array}{l} S _ {P} = (3 5 - 6) / 4 2 = . 6 9 \\ S _ {M} = (2 8 - 6) / 3 0 = . 7 3 3 \\ \end{array}
$$

Alpha:  $\overline{r} - [\overline{r}_f + \beta (r_M - r_f)]$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \alpha_ {P} = 3 5 - [ 6 + 1. 2 (2 8 - 6) ] = 2. 6 \\ \alpha_ {M} = 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

Treynor:  $(\overline{r} -\overline{r}_f) / \beta$

$$
\begin{array}{l} T _ {P} = (3 5 - 6) / 1. 2 = 2 4. 2 \\ T _ {M} = (2 8 - 6) / 1. 0 = 2 2 \\ \end{array}
$$

Information ratio:  $\alpha / \sigma(e)$

$$
\begin{array}{l} I _ {P} = 2. 6 / 1 8 = . 1 4 4 \\ I _ {M} = 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

Therefore, portfolio  $P$  outperformed the market according to the Jensen, Treynor, and information measures but had an inferior Sharpe measure.

3. The alpha exceeds zero by  $.2 / 2 = .1$  standard deviation. A table of the normal distribution (or, somewhat more appropriately, the distribution of the  $t$ -statistic) indicates that the probability of such an event, if the analyst actually has no skill, is approximately  $46\%$ .
4. The timer will guess bear or bull markets completely randomly. One-half of all bull markets will be preceded by a correct forecast, and similarly for bear markets. Hence,  $P_{1} + P_{2} - 1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} - 1 = 0$ .

5. First compute the new bogey performance as  $(.70\times 5.81) + (.25\times 1.45) + (.05\times .48) = 4.45$ a. Contribution of asset allocation to performance:

# International Diversification

# 25

ALTHOUGH WE IN the United States customarily use a broad index of U.S. equities as the market-index portfolio, the practice is increasingly inappropriate. U.S. equities represent only about  $40\%$  of world equities and a far smaller fraction of total world wealth. In this chapter, we look beyond domestic markets to survey issues of international and extended diversification.

In one sense, international investing may be viewed as no more than a straightforward generalization of our earlier treatment of portfolio selection, with a larger menu of assets from which to construct a portfolio. Similar issues of diversification, security analysis, security selection, and asset allocation face the investor. On the other hand, international investments pose some problems not encountered in domestic markets. Among these are the presence of exchange rate risk, restrictions on capital flows across national boundaries, an added dimension of political risk and country-specific regulations, and differing informational transparency in different countries. Therefore, in this chapter we review the major topics covered in the rest of the book, emphasizing their international aspects.


We begin with a brief description of international equity markets, pointing out the wide range of venues available to investors. We then turn to the central concepts of portfolio theory—risk and diversification. We will see how exchange rate fluctuations add another element to the uncertainty surrounding rates of return. However, global diversification offers opportunities for improving portfolio risk—return trade-offs. International investing also entails a range of political risks. We consider several of these risks as well as sources of information pertaining to them. Finally, we show how active asset allocation can be generalized to incorporate country and currency choices in addition to traditional domestic asset class choices and demonstrate performance attribution methods in an international context.

# 25.1 Global Markets for Equities

You can easily invest today in the capital markets of nearly 100 countries and obtain up-to-date data about your investments in each of them. In 2020, at least 35 countries had stock markets with market capitalization above 100 billion.

U.S. investors have several avenues through which they can invest internationally. The most obvious method, which is available in practice primarily to larger institutional investors, is to purchase securities directly in the capital markets of other countries. However, even small investors can take advantage of several investment vehicles with an international focus.

Shares of several foreign firms are traded in U.S. markets either directly or in the form of American depositary receipts, or ADRs. A U.S. financial institution such as a bank will purchase shares of a foreign firm in that firm's country and then issue claims to those shares in the United States. Each ADR is then a claim on a given number of the shares of stock held by the bank. Some stocks trade in the U.S. both directly and as ADRs.

There is also a wide array of mutual funds with an international focus. In addition to single-country funds, there are several open-end mutual funds with an international focus. For example, Fidelity offers funds with investments concentrated overseas, generally in Europe, in the Pacific Basin, and in developing economies in an emerging opportunities fund. Vanguard, consistent with its indexing philosophy, offers separate index funds for Europe, the Pacific Basin, and emerging markets. Finally, as noted in Chapter 4, there are many exchange-traded funds known as iShares or WEBS (World Equity Benchmark Shares) that are country-specific index products.

U.S. investors also can trade derivative securities based on prices in foreign security markets. For example, they can trade options and futures on the Nikkei stock index of 225 stocks traded on the Tokyo stock exchange or on FTSE (Financial Times Share Exchange) indexes of U.K. and European stocks.

The investments industry commonly distinguishes between "developed" and "emerging" markets. A typical emerging economy still is undergoing industrialization, is growing faster than developed economies, and has capital markets that usually entail greater risk. We use the FTSE $^1$  classifications, which emphasize capital market conditions, to characterize markets as emerging or developed.

# Developed Countries

To appreciate the myopia of an exclusive investment focus on U.S. stocks and bonds, consider the data in Table 25.1. The U.S. accounts for only  $41\%$  of world stock market capitalization. Clearly, active investors can attain better risk-return trade-offs by extending their search for attractive securities abroad. Developed countries accounted for  $53.6\%$  of world gross domestic product and  $74.5\%$  of world market capitalization.

Table 25.1 presents data on both market capitalization and GDP for a sample of developed economies. The United States is the largest economy, measured by either GDP or the size of the stock market. However, Switzerland and Luxembourg are the leaders in GDP per capita, and Hong Kong has the largest stock market compared to GDP. On average, total stock market capitalization in these countries exceeds annual GDP, but there is tremendous variation in these numbers. Capitalization as a multiple of GDP for the countries toward the bottom of the list, with smaller capital markets, is generally far lower than for those countries near the top. This suggests widespread differences in economic structure even across developed markets.

# Emerging Markets

For a passive strategy, one could argue that a portfolio of equities of just the eight developed markets with the largest capitalization would make up over two-thirds of the world portfolio and may be sufficiently diversified. However, this argument will not hold for active portfolios that seek to tilt investments toward promising assets. Active portfolios will naturally include many stocks or indexes of emerging markets.

Surely, active portfolio managers do not want to neglect stocks in dynamic markets such as China. Table 25.2 shows data from the largest emerging markets. The economies in this table account for almost one-third of the world GDP. Per capita GDP in these emerging markets is quite variable, ranging from  \$1,826 (India) to\$ 60,621 (Qatar). Market capitalization as a percent of GDP in these countries still tends to be considerably lower than in the developed countries in Table 25.1, suggesting that these markets can grow significantly over the coming years, even without spectacular growth in GDP.

that allows citizens to legally own, capitalize, and trade capital assets. As a corollary, we expect that development of equity markets will serve as a catalyst for enrichment of the population.

Figure 25.1 depicts the relationship between per capita GDP and market capitalization for both emerging and developed markets. The positive slopes of the regression lines show that, on average, countries whose capital markets play larger roles in their economies also tend to have higher levels of per capita GDP. While this single-variable correlation cannot establish causality, it is at least consistent with the notion that well-functioning security markets that effectively allocate capital can also contribute to productivity. This pattern emerges even when we treat developed and emerging markets separately.

# Home-Country Bias

We know that purely passive investment strategies would call for risky portfolios that are indexed to a broad market portfolio. In the international context, that market portfolio would include stock markets from all nations, and the market index would be a broadly diversified world portfolio.


Despite this, it is clear that investors everywhere tend to overweight investments in their home countries (relative to representation in the world portfolio) and underweight investments in foreign assets. For example, referring back to Table 25.1, a purely indexed U.S. investor would hold about  $41\%$  of the total equity portfolio in U.S. securities, with the remaining  $59\%$  invested abroad. Yet in practice, we know that U.S. investors hold a large majority of their equity investments in U.S. firms. This pattern is mirrored in the behavior of investors around the world and is commonly called home-country bias.

# 25.2 Exchange Rate Risk and International Diversification

# Exchange Rate Risk

When a U.S. investor invests abroad, the dollar-denominated return depends on two factors: first, the performance of the investment in the local currency, and second, the exchange rate at which that investment can be brought back into dollars.

# Example 25.1 Exchange Rate Risk

Consider an investment in risk-free British government bills paying  $10 \%$ annual interest in British pounds. While these U.K. bills would be the risk- free asset to a British investor, this is not the case for a U.S. investor. Suppose, for example, the current exchange rate is  \$1.40 per pound and the U.S. investor starts with\$ 14,000. That amount can be exchanged for £10,000 and invested at a riskless  $10 \%$ rate in the United Kingdom to provide £11,000 in one year.

What happens if the dollar–pound exchange rate varies over the year? Say that during the year, the pound depreciates relative to the dollar, so that by year-end only \$1.20 is required to purchase £1. The £11,000 can be exchanged at the year-end exchange rate for only $13,200 (= £11,000 × $1.20/£), resulting in a loss of \$800 relative to the initial 14,000 investment. Despite the positive 10\% pound-denominated return, the dollar-denominated return is negative 4\%.

We can generalize from Example 25.1. The  \$14,000 is exchanged for\$ 14,000/E_0 pounds, where  $E_0$  denotes the original exchange rate ( \$1.40/£). The U.K. investment grows to$ (14,000 / E_0)[1 + r_f(\mathrm{UK})]$. British pounds, where  $r_f(\mathrm{UK})$  is the risk-free rate in the United Kingdom. The pound proceeds ultimately are converted back to dollars at the subsequent exchange rate  $E_{1}$ , for total dollar proceeds of  $14,000(E_{1} / E_{0})[1 + r_{f}(\mathrm{UK})]$ . Therefore, the dollar-denominated return on the investment in British bills is


$$
1 + r (\mathrm {U S}) = \left[ 1 + r _ {f} (\mathrm {U K}) \right] E _ {1} / E _ {0} \tag {25.1}
$$

We see in Equation 25.1 that the dollar-denominated return equals the pound-denominated return times the exchange rate "return." For a U.S. investor, the investment in British bills is a combination of a safe investment in the U.K. and a risky investment in the performance of the pound relative to the dollar. Here, the pound fared poorly, falling from a value of  \$1.40 to only\$ 1.20. The loss on the pound more than offset the earnings on the British bill.

Figure 25.2 illustrates this point. It presents rates of return on stock market indexes in several countries for 2021. The bottom bar in each pair depicts returns in local currencies, while the top bar depicts returns in U.S. dollars, adjusted for exchange rate movements.

The year 2021 was generally a quiet year for exchange rates, but even then, exchange rate fluctuations had large effects on dollar-denominated returns in some countries, for example, Turkey and Argentina, both of which experienced large currency depreciations.

# Concept Check 25.1

Using the data in Example 25.1, calculate the rate of return in dollars to a U.S. investor holding the British bill if the year-end exchange rate is (a)  $E_{1} = \1.40 / \text{£}; (b) E_{1} = \$ 1.50 / \text{£} .

Exchange rate risk arises from uncertainty in exchange rate fluctuations. The investor in safe U.K. bills in Example 25.1 still bears the risk of the U.K./U.S. exchange rate. We can assess the magnitude of exchange rate risk by examining historical rates of change in various exchange rates and their correlations.

Table 25.3, Panel A, presents the annualized standard deviation of monthly percent changes in the exchange rates of major currencies against the U.S. dollar over the 5-year period ending in April 2021. The data show that currency volatility can be quite high. With the exception of the Chinese RMB, the standard deviations of percent changes in exchange rates were sizeable fractions of the standard deviation of the rate of return of the S&P 500, with annualized values ranging from  $7.10\%$  (Canadian dollar) to  $9.06\%$  (British pound). The annualized standard deviation of returns on the S&P 500 for the same period was  $15.0\%$ . An active investor who believes that a foreign stock is underpriced but has no information about any mispricing of its currency should consider hedging the currency risk exposure when tilting the portfolio toward that stock.

On the other hand, exchange rate risk may be mostly diversifiable. This is evident both from the generally negative correlations between exchange rate changes and the return on the U.S. stock market shown in the second line of Table 25.3, Panel A, as well as the low correlation coefficients among currency pairs that appear in Panel B. While most of the correlations are positive (when the U.S. dollar depreciated against one currency, it was more likely to depreciate against others as well), exchange rates hardly moved in lockstep.

Investors can hedge exchange rate risk using a forward or futures contract in foreign exchange. Recall that such contracts entail delivery or acceptance of one currency for another at a stipulated exchange rate. To illustrate, recall Example 25.1. In this case, to hedge exposure to the British pound, the U.S. investor would agree to deliver pounds for dollars at a fixed exchange rate, thereby eliminating the risk involved with the eventual conversion of the pound investment back into dollars.

# Example 25.2 Hedging Exchange Rate Risk

If the forward exchange rate in Example 25.1 had been F0 = \$1.35/£ when the investment was made, the U.S. investor could have assured a riskless dollar-denominated return by arranging to deliver the £11,000 at the forward exchange rate of \$1.35/£. In this case, the riskless U.S. return would have been 6.07\%:

$$
[ 1 + r _ {r} (\mathsf {U K}) ] F _ {0} / E _ {0} = (1. 1 0) 1. 3 5 / 1. 4 0 = 1. 0 6 0 7
$$

The hedge underlying Example 25.2 is the same strategy at the heart of the spot-futures parity relationship, first discussed in Chapter 22. In both instances, futures or forward markets are used to eliminate the risk of holding another asset. The U.S. investor can lock in a riskless dollar-denominated return either by investing in U.K. bills and hedging exchange rate risk or by investing in riskless U.S. assets. Because investments in two riskless strategies must provide equal returns, we conclude that  $[1 + r_f(\mathrm{UK})]F_0 / E_0 = 1 + r_f(\mathrm{US})$ , which can be rearranged to

$$
\frac {F _ {0}}{E _ {0}} = \frac {1 + r _ {f} (\mathrm {U S})}{1 + r _ {f} (\mathrm {U K})} \tag {25.2}
$$

This relationship is called the interest rate parity relationship or covered interest arbitrage relationship, which we first encountered in Chapter 23.

Unfortunately, such perfect exchange rate hedging usually is not so easy. In our example, we knew exactly how many pounds to sell forward because the pound-denominated return in the United Kingdom was riskless. If the U.K. investment had not been in bills, but instead had been in risky U.K. equity, we would not have known the ultimate pound value of the U.K. investment or, therefore, how many pounds to sell forward. The hedging opportunity offered by foreign exchange forward contracts would thus be imperfect.

To summarize, the generalization of Equation 25.1 for unhedged investments is that

$$
1 + r (\mathrm {U S}) = [ 1 + r (\text {f o r e i g n}) ] E _ {1} / E _ {0} \tag {25.3}
$$ where  r(\text{foreign})  is the possibly risky return earned in the currency of the foreign investment and exchange rates are direct quotes ( per unit of foreign currency). You can set up a perfect hedge only in the special case that  r(\text{foreign})  is actually known. In that case, you must sell in the forward or futures market an amount of foreign currency equal to [1 + r(\text{foreign})] for each unit of that currency you purchase today.

# Concept Check 25.2

How many pounds would the investor in Example 25.2 need to sell forward to hedge exchange rate risk if (a)  $r(\mathrm{UK}) = 20\%;$  (b)  $r(\mathrm{UK}) = 30\%$ ?

# Investment Risk in International Markets

While active-strategy managers engage in both individual-market asset allocation as well as security selection, we will restrict our focus to market-index portfolios across countries, keeping us on the side of an enhanced passive strategy. Nevertheless, our analysis illustrates the essential features of extended active management as well.

As we pointed out in Chapter 5, estimates of mean returns are extremely unreliable without very long data series. Little can be learned about average rates of return from periods as short as 5 or even 10 years. This is because estimates of expected return essentially depend on only the initial and final stock price (which fully determine the average compound rate of increase). Long sample periods are intrinsically necessary for precise estimates of expected return. However, over such long periods, the mean of the return distribution can change. This is a difficult hurdle for empirical research.

In contrast, estimates of volatility can be informed by return variation within the sample period. Increasing the frequency of observations therefore can increase the accuracy of risk estimates, making precise estimates feasible even with relatively short sample periods.

Therefore, we will focus largely on the risk of international investments, where we are more confident in our empirical estimates. We will use monthly data on country index returns for the five years ending in 2021.

Table 25.4 shows key statistics for the investment risk of various equity indexes during this period. The indexes include most of the world's largest equity markets as well as markets from regions with smaller and less developed capital markets. The first pair of columns show the standard deviation of monthly returns both measured in local currency as well as translated into U.S. dollars, thus reflecting the impact of exchange rate movements in each month.

Switzerland had the lowest volatility of equity returns, both in local as well as dollar-denominated terms. Its higher dollar-denominated volatility reflects the added risk attributable to exchange rate movements. But in general, the impact of exchange rate movements on the volatility of dollar-denominated returns is minimal. On average, the volatility of dollar-denominated returns is not much higher than that of local returns. (The mean and median estimates reported in Table 25.4 are computed only over the individual country indexes.)

Correlations with the MSCI World index, shown in the next pair of columns, are also broadly similar for local and dollar-denominated returns. (Local currency correlations use local-currency returns for both indexes and MSCI World; dollar-denominated correlations use exclusively dollar returns.) Not surprisingly, given the prominence of the U.S. in the World portfolio and the prominence of its economy in the world economy, the U.S. has the highest correlation with the World index. The Shanghai index is notable among the larger capital markets for its low correlation with the rest of the world.

Table 25.5 shows results for index model regressions of each country's (or region's) index against the MSCI World portfolio. The betas of each index against the World portfolio appear in the first pair of columns. The beta of the U.S. against the World portfolio is just about 1.0 when returns are measured in dollars. However, the average beta of other countries against the MSCI World portfolio is less than 1.0. Betas computed from dollar-denominated returns are on average lower than those using local returns but not substantially so.

We do not report country-index alphas in this table because results over five years are such unreliable forecasts of future performance. As we noted above, this is a common problem in using a historical sample to estimate expected returns (as opposed to risk measures). It is why many decades of data are commonly used to estimate "normal" returns on the broad market portfolio. Nevertheless, in this sample period, we can report that the median alpha measured in local currencies was small, only  $-15$  basis points. The dollar generally was little changed against other currencies in this period, so the average dollar-denominated alpha was virtually identical,  $-15$  basis points per month.

The second pair of columns in Table 25.5 show the residual standard deviation for each country index. As discussed in Chapter 8, the regression residual in each month is the portion of the index return that is independent of the return on the World portfolio. The entries in these columns are therefore estimates of the standard deviation of "country-specific returns." The results are consistent with the other risk measures. The U.S. has the lowest country-specific risk, reflecting its prominence in the World portfolio. Indexes for the countries in the Arab world and Latin America have considerably higher nonsystematic risk despite the fact that these indexes already enjoy some diversification across the countries

# Table 25.5

Index model regressions of country or region indexes against the MSCI World index using both local and dollar-denominated returns included in each region. Average country-specific risk is essentially the same regardless of whether returns are measured in local or foreign currency. By and large, country-specific risk is meaningful. Even the U.S. value of  $0.8\%$  per month (dollar-denominated returns) is not trivial. The message is that international diversification is potentially valuable.


By and large, the results in Table 25.4 and Table 25.5 indicate that investment risk is pretty much the same regardless of whether we use local currency or dollar-denominated returns. Therefore, we will focus largely on local-currency returns when we turn to the potential for international diversification in the next section.

# International Diversification

In Chapter 7, we looked at the risk of equally weighted portfolios composed of different numbers of U.S. stocks chosen at random and saw the efficacy of naive diversification. Figure 25.3 presents the results of a similar

It's one of the golden rules of investing: Reduce risk by diversifying your money into a variety of holdings—stock funds, bonds, commodities—that don't move in lockstep with one another. And it's a rule that's getting tougher to obey.

According to recent research, an array of investments whose prices used to rise and fall independently are now increasingly correlated. For investors, that poses a troubling issue: how to maintain a portfolio diversified enough so all the pieces don't tank at once.

The current correlation trend doesn't mean investors should go out and ditch their existing investments. It's just that they may not be "getting the same diversification" they thought if the investment decisions were made some time ago, says Mr. Ezrati, chief economist at money-management firm Lord Abbott & Co. He adds that over long periods of time, going back decades, sometimes varied asset classes tend to converge.

One explanation for today's higher correlation is increased globalization, which has made the economies of various countries more interdependent. International stocks, even with their higher correlations at present, deserve some allocation in a long-term investor's holdings, says Jeff Tjornehoj, an analyst at data firm Lipper Inc. Mr. Tjornehoj is among those who believe these correlations are a temporary phenomenon, and expects that the diversity will return some time down the line—a year or few years.

exercise, but one in which diversification includes stocks from around the world. You can see that extending the universe of investable assets to foreign stocks allows even greater opportunities for risk reduction.

Of course, as emphasized in the nearby box, the benefits from diversification depend on the correlation structure among securities. The box notes that international correlations have increased over time. Table 25.6 shows correlation pairs (using local currency returns) for our sample of country and regional indexes. This correlation matrix can be used to construct the minimum-variance portfolio, which provides a better estimate of the

# Table 25.7

Composition and volatility of internationally diversified portfolios potential benefits from diversification than the naïve diversification exercise conducted in Figure 25.3.


Table 25.7 shows portfolio volatility using equal weights for each country or regional index (column 1), using minimum variance weights (column 2), or using minimum variance weights without allowing short sales (column 3). The equally weighted portfolio is in the spirit of Figure 25.3. Even naïve diversification provides considerable benefit: The standard deviation of the portfolio is  $15.1\%$ , which is only  $62\%$  of the average of the individual country and regional standard deviations. But we can reduce volatility considerably from this level. The minimum variance portfolio has a standard deviation of only  $7.6\%$  when we allow short sales, and  $10.2\%$  when we do not. We see here ample evidence for the potential of international diversification to substantially reduce portfolio risk.

What about efficient diversification that achieves the best risk-return trade-off? This is harder to assess because, as we have pointed out several times, sample average returns over short periods do not provide reliable estimates of expected returns. However, as an alternative to historical returns, we can estimate expected returns from an international version of the CAPM. Table 25.8 presents such estimates using the MSCI World index as the market portfolio and assuming a risk-free rate of  $2\%$  and market risk premium of  $8\%$ . Given these expected returns, the standard deviations in Table 25.4, and the correlation matrix in Table 25.6, we can generate the efficient frontier. The results appear in Figure 25.4.

The frontier in Figure 25.4 makes clear the benefits of international diversification. The U.S. market index appears as the solid dot. Given the fact that the U.S. has the highest Sharpe ratio of any individual country, it is perhaps not surprising that it plots near the boundary of the efficient frontier. Nevertheless, it is still located substantially below

The CAL supported by the U.S. index has a Sharpe ratio (based on monthly returns) of .2037. Although this is the highest ratio of any country or region in the sample, its Sharpe ratio is noticeably less than that of the tangency portfolio, .225. It is clear that a U.S. investor who forgoes international equity markets is giving up ample opportunities to improve the risk-return trade-off of the optimal risky portfolio.

# Are Benefits from International Diversification Preserved in Bear Markets?

Some studies suggest that correlation in country portfolio returns increases during periods of turbulence in capital markets. If so, benefits from diversification would be lost exactly when they are needed the most. For example, a study by Roll of the crash of October 1987 shows that all 23 country indexes studied declined over the crash period of October 12-26. Figure 25.5 shows returns of stock indexes from around the world on either October 19 or, to account for time zone differences, October 19-20. These common extreme losses indicate substantial cross-border correlation. Roll found that the beta of a country index on the world index (estimated prior to the crash) was the best predictor of that index's response to the October crash of the U.S. stock market. This suggests a common factor underlying the movement of stocks around the world. This model predicts that a macroeconomic shock would affect all countries and that while diversification can mitigate risk, it cannot eliminate exposure to such broad-based events.

The 2008 crash of stock markets around the world allows us to test Roll's prediction. The data in Figure 25.6 include average monthly rates of return for both the 10-year period 1999-2008 and the crisis period corresponding to the last four months of 2008, as well as the beta on the U.S. market and monthly standard deviation for several portfolios. The graph shows that both beta against the U.S. and the country-index standard deviation help explain the difference between crisis period returns and overall period averages. Market behavior during the 1987 crisis, that is, larger correlations in extreme bad times, repeated itself in the crisis of 2008, vindicating Roll's analysis.

# 25.3 Political Risk

In principle, security analysis at the macroeconomic, industry, and firm-specific levels is similar in all countries. Such analysis aims to provide estimates of expected returns and risks of individual assets and portfolios. However, information about assets in a foreign country is by nature more difficult to acquire.

In addition, political risk varies dramatically across countries, and its assessment requires expertise in each nation's economic, legal, tax, and political environment. A leading organization providing political risk assessment for investors is the PRS Group (Political Risk Services), and the presentation here follows the PRS methodology.

PRS's country risk analysis results in a country composite risk rating on a scale of 0 (most risky) to 100 (least risky). To illustrate, Table 25.9 shows the rank of a small sample of countries from the January 2021 issue of PRS's International Country Risk Guide. It is not surprising to find Singapore at the top of the low-risk list and small emerging markets at the bottom, with Sudan (ranked 140) closing the list. What may be surprising is the fairly mediocre ranking of the U.S. (ranked 38).

The composite risk rating is a weighted average of three measures: political risk, financial risk, and economic risk. Political risk is measured on a scale of 100–0, while financial risk and economic risk are each measured on a scale of 50–0. The three measures are added and divided by 2 to obtain the composite rating. The variables used by PRS to determine the composite risk rating from the three measures are shown in Table 25.10.

Table 25.11 shows the three risk measures for the same sample of countries in order of the ranking of composite risk. The table shows that the United States was among the best performers in terms of political risk. But it fared poorly in terms of financial and economic risk. The surprisingly poor performance of the U.S. in this dimension was probably due to its large government and balance-of-trade deficits. Exchange rate stability, foreign trade imbalance, and foreign indebtedness all enter PRS's computation of financial risk.

Finally, Table 25.12 shows ratings of political risk by each of its 12 components. The U.S. does well in corruption risk (variable F) and democratic accountability (variable K). China does well in government stability (variable A) but poorly in democratic accountability (variable K).

# 25.4 International Investing and Performance Attribution

Because many security markets may be less efficient than those in highly developed economies such as the U.S., international investing offers greater opportunities for active managers. International investing calls for specialization in additional fields of analysis: currency movements, country prospects, and industry analysis in a worldwide context; it also entails a larger universe for stock selection.

# Constructing a Benchmark Portfolio of Foreign Assets

Active (as well as passive) international investing requires a benchmark portfolio (called the bogey). One widely used international market index is the MSCI World index. MSCI also computes variants on this index that exclude some large markets such as the U.S.

Another popular non-U.S. index is the Europe, Australasia, Far East (EAFE) index of large and mid-cap securities in 21 developed markets, also computed by MSCI. Other indexes of world equity performance are published by Capital International Indices, Salomon Brothers, Credit Suisse First Boston, and Goldman Sachs. Portfolios designed to mirror or even replicate the country, currency, and company representation of these indexes would be the obvious generalization of the purely domestic passive equity strategy.

An issue that sometimes arises in the international context is the appropriateness of marketcapitalization weighting schemes in the construction of international indexes. Capitalization weighting is far and away the most common approach. However, some argue that it might not be the best weighting scheme in an international context. This is in part because different countries have differing proportions of their corporate sector organized as publicly traded firms.

Table 25.13 shows market-capitalization weights versus GDP weights for most of the countries in the EAFE index. These data reveal substantial disparities between the relative sizes of market capitalization and GDP. The countries with smaller stock markets (toward the bottom of the table) tend to have a much smaller share of EAFE total market capitalization than their share of EAFE GDP. For example, while Germany accounts for  $16.7\%$  of total EAFE GDP, it represents only  $6.4\%$  of the market cap of the index. At the other extreme, Hong Kong accounts for only  $1.5\%$  of GDP, but it represents  $4.2\%$  of total EAFE market cap. These disparities indicate that a greater proportion of economic activity is conducted by publicly traded firms in Hong Kong than in the other EAFE countries.

Some argue that it would be more appropriate to weight international indexes by GDP rather than market capitalization. The justification for this view is that an internationally diversified portfolio should purchase shares in proportion to the broad asset base of each country, and GDP might be a better measure of the weight of a country in the international economy than the value of its outstanding stocks. Others have even suggested weights proportional to the import share of various countries. The argument is that investors who wish to hedge the price of imported goods might choose to hold securities in foreign firms in proportion to the goods imported from those countries.

# Excel Questions

1. Find three points on the efficient frontier corresponding to three different expected returns. What are the portfolio standard deviations corresponding to each expected return?
2. Now assume that the correlation between the S&P 500 and the other country indexes is cut in half. Find the new standard deviations corresponding to each of the three expected returns. Are they higher or lower? Why?

# Performance Attribution

We can measure the contribution of each of the following decisions to portfolio performance following a procedure similar to the performance attribution techniques introduced in Chapter 24.

1. Currency selection measures the contribution to total portfolio performance attributable to exchange rate fluctuations relative to the investor's benchmark currency, which we will take to be the U.S. dollar. We might use a benchmark like the EAFE index to compare a portfolio's currency selection for a particular period to that of a passive benchmark. The benchmark for currency selection would be the weighted average of the appreciation of the currencies represented in the EAFE portfolio using as weights the fraction of that portfolio invested in each currency.

2. Country selection measures the contribution to portfolio performance attributable to investing in the better-performing stock markets of the world. It can be assessed from the weighted average of the equity index returns of each country using as weights the share of the manager's portfolio in each country. We use index returns to abstract from the effect of security selection within countries. To measure the contribution of country selection, we compare the manager's weighted average to the weighted average of a benchmark passive allocation, for example, the share of each country in the EAFE portfolio.
3. Stock selection ability may, as in Chapter 24, be measured as the weighted average of equity returns in excess of the equity index in each country. Here, we would use local currency returns and use as weights the investments in each country.
4. Cash/bond selection may be measured as the excess return derived from weighting bonds and bills differently from some benchmark weights.

Table 25.14 provides an example of how to measure the contribution of the decisions an international portfolio manager might make.

# Concept Check 25.3

Using the data in Table 25.14, compute the manager's country and currency selections if portfolio weights had been  $40\%$  in Europe,  $20\%$  in Australasia, and  $40\%$  in the Far East.

1. U.S. assets account for less than half of the world portfolio. International capital markets offer important opportunities for portfolio diversification with enhanced risk-return characteristics.
2. Exchange rate risk imparts an extra source of uncertainty to investments denominated in foreign currencies. Much of that risk can be hedged in foreign exchange futures or forward markets, but a perfect hedge is not feasible unless the foreign investment's rate of return is known in advance.
3. Returns in different countries are far from perfectly correlated. Therefore, there is a benefit from international diversification. The minimum variance global portfolio has considerably lower volatility than almost any individual country index, including that of the U.S. More importantly, single-country stock indexes, again including those of the U.S., plot considerably inside the efficient frontier constructed when foreign equity markets are added to the investment menu. Therefore, international investing offers ample opportunities to improve the risk-reward trade-off.
4. International investing entails an added dimension of political risk, including uncertainty about government and social stability, democratic accountability, macroeconomic conditions, international trade, and legal protections afforded individuals, businesses, and investors. Several services now exist that sell information about political risk to interested parties.
5. Several world market indexes can form a basis for passive international investing. Active international management can be partitioned into currency selection, country selection, stock selection, and cash/bond selection.

Calculate the expected price change required in the Canadian government bond that would result in the two bonds having equal total returns in U.S. dollars over a 6-month horizon. Assume that the yield to maturity on the U.S. bond is expected to remain unchanged.

6. A global manager plans to invest 1 million in U.S. government cash equivalents for the next 90 days. However, she is also authorized to use non-U.S. government cash equivalents, as long as the currency risk is hedged to U.S. dollars using forward currency contracts.

a. What rate of return will the manager earn if she invests in money market instruments in either Canada or Japan and hedges the dollar value of her investment? Use the data in the following tables.
b. What must be the approximate value of the 90-day interest rate available on U.S. government securities?

7. The Windsor Foundation, a U.S.-based, not-for-profit charitable organization, has a diversified investment portfolio of 100 million. Windsor's board of directors is considering an initial investment in emerging market equities. Robert Houston, treasurer of the foundation, has made the following comments: a. "For an investor holding only developed market equities, the existence of stable emerging market currencies is one of several preconditions necessary for that investor to realize strong emerging market performance."

b. "Local currency depreciation against the dollar has been a frequent occurrence for U.S. investors in emerging markets. U.S. investors have consistently seen large percentages of their returns erased by currency depreciation. This is true even for long-term investors."
c. "Historically, the addition of emerging market stocks to a U.S. equity portfolio such as the S&P 500 index has reduced volatility; volatility has also been reduced when emerging market stocks are combined with an international portfolio such as the MSCI EAFE index."

Discuss whether each of Houston's comments is correct or incorrect.

8. After much research on the developing economy and capital markets of the country of Otunia, your firm, GAC, has decided to include an investment in the Otunia stock market in its Emerging Markets Commingled Fund. However, GAC has not yet decided whether to invest actively or by indexing. Your opinion on the active versus indexing decision has been solicited. The following is a summary of the research findings:

Otunia's economy is fairly well-diversified across agricultural and natural resources, manufacturing (both consumer and durable goods), and a growing finance sector. Transaction costs in securities markets are relatively large in Otunia because of high commissions and government "stamp taxes" on securities trades. Accounting standards and disclosure regulations are quite detailed, resulting in wide public availability of reliable information about companies' financial performance.

Capital flows into and out of Otunia, and foreign ownership of Otunia securities, are strictly regulated by an agency of the national government. The settlement procedures under these ownership rules often cause long delays in settling trades made by nonresidents. Senior finance officials in the government are working to deregulate capital flows and foreign ownership, but GAC's political consultant believes that isolationist sentiment may prevent much real progress in the short run.

a. Briefly discuss aspects of the Otunia environment that favor investing actively and aspects that favor indexing.
b. Recommend whether GAC should invest in Otunia actively or by indexing. Justify your recommendation based on the factors identified in part (a).

# E-INVESTMENTS EXERCISES

A common misconception is that investors can earn excess returns by investing in foreign bonds with higher interest rates than are available in the U.S. Interest rate parity implies that any such interest rate differentials will be offset by premiums or discounts in the forward or futures market for foreign currency.

Interest rates on government bonds in the U.S., U.K., Japan, Germany, and Australia can be found at www.bloomberg.com. Look for the Rates and Bonds tab. Spot exchange rates on international currencies can be found by clicking the Currencies tab.

Forward exchange rates on currency futures contracts can be found at www.cmgroup.com.

1. Select one of these countries and record the yield on a short-term government security from the Bloomberg Web site. Also make note of the U.S. Treasury yield on an instrument with the same (or closest possible) maturity.
2. Record the spot exchange rate from the Bloomberg site and the futures exchange rate from the CME Web site for the date closest to the maturity of the investment you chose in the previous question.
3. Calculate the rate of return available on the foreign government security, converting the foreign currency transactions into dollars at the current and forward exchange rates.
4. How well does interest rate parity seem to hold? Are there bargains to be found in other currencies? What factors might account for interest rate parity violation?

# Alternative Assets

# 26

THE TRADITIONAL ASSET CLASSES of publicly traded stocks and bonds still dominate the portfolios of most individual and institutional investors. But the universe of alternative assets has increased dramatically in recent decades for institutional investors as well as so-called accredited (wealthy and/or financially literate) individual investors. Though there is no standard definition of what makes an investment "alternative," they are generally classified into four major subclasses: hedge funds, private equity and debt, real assets, and structured products.

Alternatives raise virtually every issue addressed in earlier chapters—security analysis, market efficiency (or inefficiency), efficient diversification, hedging, liquidity, option pricing, and the quantification of risk. For example, venture capital funds invest in highly risky start-ups. The required rate of return on a venture fund is necessarily high, but its investments are made in a less efficient segment of the market. Moreover, venture capitalists (VCs) are not merely investors; as active stewards of their portfolio firms, their participation changes the value of those companies. VCs attempt to improve the structure and function of these start-ups with the end goal of generating substantial returns through successful exits.

Hedge funds, another class of alternative assets, often bet on the relative mispricing of specific securities but try to hedge broad market exposure; their strategies constitute a challenge to market efficiency. This sort of pure "alpha seeking" behavior requires a procedure for optimally mixing an investment in a hedge fund with a more traditional portfolio. Other hedge funds engage in aggressive market timing; their risk profiles can shift rapidly and substantially, raising difficult questions for performance evaluation. Many hedge funds take extensive derivatives positions. Even those funds that do not trade derivatives charge incentive fees that resemble the payoff to a call option; understanding options, therefore, is necessary to interpret hedge fund strategies as well as their costs. In short, alternative assets raise the full range of issues associated with active portfolio management.


We begin with an overview of alternative assets. We then survey the hedge fund universe, devoting considerable attention to the classic "market-neutral" or hedged strategies that historically gave hedge funds their name. We then turn to the private equity asset classes of venture capital and leveraged buyouts, focusing on how each of these investors generates value. We move on to evidence on the investment performance of alternative assets and the special difficulties in evaluating that performance. Finally, we consider the implications of the fee structures charged by such funds.

# 26.1 Alternative Assets

Alternative assets depart from traditional ones in both form and function. They comprise four broad sectors: hedge funds, private equity and debt, real assets, and structured products.

# The Alternative Asset Universe

Hedge Funds Like mutual funds, hedge funds are investment pools. The net asset value (NAV) of each share represents the value of the investor's stake in the portfolio. While hedge funds thus have many similarities to mutual funds, there are several important differences, including transparency, the investors themselves, liquidity, and investment strategies.

Private Equity Private equity funds are also pools of investments, though they aim to generate value through their direct impact on firm operations and strategy. Private equity includes angel investors, venture capital funds, and buyout funds. Angel investors are wealthy individuals or families who invest in entrepreneurs, typically in the earliest stages of development. Venture capital funds invest in entrepreneurs as well, but a VC fund is professionally managed, either as an independent firm or as an investment arm of a larger corporation. Leveraged buyout investors deploy considerable leverage to acquire publicly traded firms. Once acquired, these firms are private and subject to operational and financial restructuring. All three of these investment approaches differ markedly from one another, but all fall under the umbrella of private equity, as none of their assets under management trade publicly.

Real Assets Real assets include real estate, natural resources, and commodities. Real estate is ownership in land or buildings. The investment can be direct, such as a piece of rental property, or indirect, through investment vehicles such as a real estate investment trust (REIT), private equity real estate, or pooled mortgages (mortgage-backed securities).

Commodities are refined or extracted resources often used as production inputs, such as energy, metals, animal products, grains, and lumber. They are valued almost entirely in proportion to the volume of the commodity; that is, the market treats different batches of goods as effectively equivalent.

Structured Products Structured products combine securities and often derivatives to generate custom-designed market-linked outcomes. Structured products can be highly individualized with payoffs designed to generate customized risk exposures. They are built to protect a broader portfolio from specific risks; it is sometimes cheaper to employ a structurer (structured-product designer) rather than to use market-traded options, swaps, or other derivatives to achieve the desired return profile.

Chapter 1 emphasized that real assets include all those that convey intrinsic productive capacity; we will consider only investable assets.
2We will devote most of this chapter to hedge funds and private equity. There are many resources available for real estate investing. For example, Real Estate Finance and Investments (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2022) by William Brueggeman and Jeffrey Fisher is an excellent source on real estate investment vehicles and valuation. The Real Estate Game (New York: Free Press, 1999) by William Poorvu and Jeffrey Cruikshank is an accessible introductory treatment.

# Alternative Assets versus Traditional Assets

While an equilibrium risk-versus-expected return relationship should apply to all assets, alternatives differ significantly from traditional asset classes in structure, strategy, and other key characteristics. Here are some of the key differences.

Transparency Mutual funds are subject to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, which require transparency and predictability of strategy as well as periodic public updates on portfolio composition. In contrast, hedge funds and private equity usually are set up as limited liability partnerships or limited liability companies and provide minimal information about strategy and portfolio composition to their investors only.

Investors Hedge funds and private equity funds are open only to "accredited" investors, defined by minimum net worth ( \$1,000,000 excluding primary residence), income requirements (\$ 200,000+ per year for the past two years), or certain professional certifications or employment. They generally do not advertise to the public, and minimum investments often are between \$500,000 and \$1,000,000.

Investment Strategies Traditional mutual funds lay out their general investment approach in their prospectus and face pressure to avoid style drift (departure from their stated investment thesis). Most mutual funds promise to limit their use of short-selling and leverage, and their use of derivatives is highly restricted. Even so-called 130/30 mutual funds, which allow for more active short-selling and derivative positions, are far less flexible than hedge funds.

In contrast, hedge funds may effectively partake in any investment strategy and may act opportunistically as conditions evolve. Treating hedge funds as a uniform asset class would be highly misguided, for they engage in a wide range of styles and strategies—derivatives, distressed firms, currency speculation, convertible bonds, emerging markets, merger arbitrage, and so on. Some may jump from one asset class to another.

**Liquidity** Hedge funds often impose lock-up periods, that is, periods as long as several years in which investments cannot be withdrawn. Many also employ redemption notices requiring investors to provide notice weeks or months in advance of their desire to redeem funds. These restrictions limit investors' liquidity, in this case, the time it takes to convert their investments to cash. This limited liquidity, in turn, enables funds to invest in illiquid assets where returns may be higher, without worrying about meeting unanticipated demands for redemptions.

Similarly, private equity funds often impose lock-up periods following an IPO. This prevents large excessive sell pressure that might affect prices after an IPO. The average lock-up period is six months, though the average holding period of most private equity post-IPO is three years.[6] In contrast to private equity, some real assets, for example, commodity positions established via futures contracts, can be very liquid. Real estate, by contrast, is illiquid.

The Securities and Exchange Commission defines accredited investors in Regulation D, which was amended in 2020 to include several new categories, including the professional certifications Series 7, 65, and 82 and certain knowledgeable employees of private funds.
4 These are funds that may sell short up to  $30\%$  of the value of their portfolios, using the proceeds to increase their positions in invested assets. For every  $\$100$  in net assets, the fund may sell short  $\$30$ , investing the proceeds to increase its long positions to  $\$130$ . This gives rise to the 130/30 moniker. These mutual funds serve primarily institutional clients.
Even the name "hedge fund" is a misnomer; many fund strategies depart from the original, market-risk hedged strategy of the father of modern hedge funds, Alfred Jones.
Tim Jenkinson, Howard Jones, and Christian Rauch, "Long Goodbyes: Why Do Private Equity Funds Hold onto Public Equity?" (February 28, 2022). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3753480.

Investment Horizon Mutual fund investors do not have a fixed endpoint; most private equity funds do. For example, a venture capital fund is typically designed to last 10 years, at which point the fund is liquidated and proceeds are distributed to investors. Portfolio companies must be "harvested" and thus exited during that timeframe. Thus, private equity investments occur with one eye on the eventual exit from the portfolio companies.

Fee Structure Hedge funds and private equity also differ from mutual funds in their fee structure. Mutual funds assess management fees equal to a fixed percentage of assets under management (see Chapter 4 for a detailed treatment of the different ways fees are applied). The management fee for alternative investments is usually between  $1\%$  and  $2\%$  of assets, but these funds also typically charge an incentive fee equal to a fraction of any investment profits beyond some benchmark. The incentive fee is often  $20\%$ , subject to a threshold return that must be met (more on this in Section 26.6).

# Role of Alternative Assets in Diversified Portfolios

Chapter 25 demonstrated how international diversification improved the expected return-risk profile for a domestic investor because the correlation between domestic stocks and international stocks is typically considerably less than 1.0. We will see that alternative investments have similarly low correlations with traditional asset classes and thus offer significant diversification potential. Some hedge funds and private equity funds also have demonstrated high historical rates of return, suggesting they can act as "engines" of capital growth. Incorporating these asset classes would then increase the Sharpe ratio of a portfolio while allowing it to better reflect the full asset universe.

Endowments, foundations, and pension funds have found great success over long investment periods through the aggressive incorporation of alternative assets, notably hedge funds, private equity, and real assets like energy and timber funds. Endowments, particularly larger ones (those with more than 1 billion in assets under management), tend to tilt their allocations toward equity and alternatives in pursuit of their dual long-term investment goals of capital preservation and meeting or exceeding spending-rate targets.

Accredited investors may also include alternative investments in their portfolios for long-term growth and diversification. While the investment horizon of an individual investor is short compared to the horizon of an institution, the potential improvement in Sharpe ratio offered by these investments justifies the loss of liquidity.

# Growth of Alternative Assets

Hedge funds, as an asset class, have seen the largest growth in recent years, from  \$263 billion in 2000 to over\$ 4 trillion in 2021. Venture capital and leveraged buyout funds dominate the private equity sector, and both have experienced rapid recent growth. For example, venture capital grew from \$225 billion in assets under management in 2000 to nearly \$1 trillion in 2021. Figure 26.1 demonstrates the growth of assets under management

Institutional investors, such as those that manage university endowments, foundations, and pension funds, have a fiduciary responsibility to the owners of those funds. This means they are legally obligated to act in good faith and trust on behalf of their clients' best interests, putting those interests ahead of even their own. The "prudent man rule" (since renamed the prudent person rule) was first applied to investments in the U.S. trust law case Harvard College v. Amory (1830), which required trustees to defend their investment decisions as prudent. But how does one define prudence?

After several false starts, Congress passed The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in 1974. This act greatly expanded the regulation of defined benefit retirement plans under the stewardship of three government agencies: the Internal Revenue Service, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and the Department of Labor. Among other requirements, ERISA mandated that prudence means, among other things, "... diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so. . . ." The original interpretation of this rule implied that high-volatility investments such as in start-ups (e.g., venture capital) and most derivatives (e.g., via hedge funds) would likely not be considered judicious and would violate the ERISA's fiduciary standard of care. Fund managers thus overweighted traditionally safer asset classes at the cost of performance.


This changed in June 1979, when the Department of Labor issued a clarification stating: "An investment decision should be judged with regard to the role the investment plays in the pension plan's overall portfolio." This means the volatility of an investment viewed as a stand-alone position need not render it injudicious; instead, investment risk needs to be assessed as part of a larger strategy of diversification across asset classes. Many "speculative" assets could be entirely prudent when part of a diversified portfolio. Further adding to the flexibility of this clarification, ERISA did not create a list of allowable or forbidden securities, implying that prudence is better defined within the context of each individual fund's circumstances.

The historic rise of alternative asset classes has many sources, but this clarification is perhaps the critical one. After 1979, it was considered judicious to allow for the inclusion of riskier asset classes such as hedge funds and private equity as a part of a broader asset allocation approach. Figure 26.1 shows the rapid increase in these sectors beginning roughly in 2003. A great diversity of capital sources, including pensions, endowments, foundations, and other investors, flooded into these alternative investments, profoundly changing the nature of performance and risk for their beneficiaries.

The nearby box discusses how the rapid expansion of this sector was facilitated by changes in regulations regarding the sorts of assets in which pension funds were allowed to invest.

# 26.2 Hedge Funds

The hedge fund universe encompasses a broad range of styles, making it difficult to treat these funds as a uniform asset class. Table 26.1 lists most of the common investment themes. Notice that many of these strategies do not actually hedge any particular risk. For example, long/short equity funds seek to generate abnormal returns by buying undervalued stocks and shorting overvalued ones. In contrast, market-neutral strategies also use long- short strategies but those funds seek to hedge exposure to market risk.

# Hedge Fund Strategies

Though diverse, hedge fund strategies generally fall into two categories: directional and nondirectional. Directional strategies are straightforward bets that one sector will outperform other sectors of the market.

<table><tr><td>Style</td><td>Strategy</td></tr><tr><td>Equity market neutral</td><td>Commonly uses long/short hedges. Typically controls for industry, sector, size, and other exposures and establishes market-neutral positions designed to exploit some market inefficiency. Typically deploys leverage to amplify inefficiencies.</td></tr><tr><td>Long/short equity hedge</td><td>Equity-oriented positions on either side of the market (i.e., long or short), depending on outlook. Not meant to be market neutral; low beta may be incidental. May establish a concentrated focus regionally (e.g., U.S. or Europe) or on a specific sector (e.g., tech or health care stocks). Derivatives may be used to hedge positions.</td></tr><tr><td>Dedicated short bias</td><td>Net short position, usually in equities, as opposed to pure short exposure. In recent years, the number of true dedicated short bias managers has dwindled.</td></tr><tr><td>Event driven</td><td>Attempts to profit from events such as mergers &amp; acquisitions (risk-arbitrage event driven), regulatory changes, restructurings, bankruptcies, and reorganizations (distressed event driven), or other litigation. Can invest across asset classes and events (multi-strategy event driven).</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed-income arbitrage</td><td>Attempts to profit from price anomalies in related interest rate securities. Includes interest rate swap arbitrage, U.S. versus non-U.S. government bond arbitrage, yield-curve arbitrage, and mortgage-backed arbitrage.</td></tr><tr><td>Convertible arbitrage</td><td>Hedged investing in convertible securities, typically long convertible bonds and short corresponding stock, particularly when there is a price discrepancy in the conversion ratio.</td></tr><tr><td>Global macro</td><td>Involves long and short positions in capital or derivative markets across the world. Portfolio positions reflect views on broad market conditions and major economic trends.</td></tr><tr><td>Emerging markets</td><td>Goal is to exploit market inefficiencies in emerging markets. Typically long only because short-selling is not feasible in many developing markets. Can be invested across asset classes (and currency).</td></tr><tr><td>Managed futures</td><td>Use financial, currency, or commodity futures. May make use of technical trading rules or a less structured judgmental approach.</td></tr><tr><td>Multistrategy</td><td>Opportunistic choice of strategy depending on outlook.</td></tr><tr><td>Fund of funds</td><td>Fund allocates its cash to several other hedge funds to be managed.</td></tr></table>

# Table 26.1

Hedge Fund Styles*

*Credit Suisse maintains one of the most comprehensive databases on hedge fund performance. It categorizes hedge funds into these different investment styles.

In contrast, nondirectional strategies are designed to exploit temporary misalignments in security valuations. For example, if the corporate bond yields seem abnormally high compared to Treasury bond yields, even after accounting for default risk, the hedge fund would buy corporate bonds and short sell Treasury securities. The fund is not betting on broad movements in the entire bond market—it buys one type of bond and sells another. By taking a long/short position, the fund hedges interest rate exposure while making a bet on the relative valuation across the two sectors. If yield spreads revert to their "normal" relationship, the fund profits from the realignment regardless of the general trend in interest rates. The bet is designed to be market neutral—or hedged—with respect to the direction of interest rates, which gives rise to the term "hedge fund."10

Nondirectional strategies are sometimes further divided into convergence or relative value positions. The difference between them is the certainty of the time horizon at which the mispricing resolves. An example of a convergence strategy would entail exploiting the mispricing of a futures contract that must be corrected by the time the contract matures. In contrast, the corporate versus Treasury spread we just discussed would be a relative value strategy because there is no obvious horizon during which the yield spread would "correct" from unusual levels.

# Example 26.1 Market Neutral Positions

Several hedge funds have deployed a market-neutral position using a strategy based on the following observation: Newly issued or "on-the-run" 30-year Treasury bonds regularly sell at higher prices (lower yields) than  $29 \frac{1}{2}$ -year bonds with almost identical duration. The yield spread presumably is a premium due to the greater liquidity of the on-the-run bonds. Hedge funds, with relatively low liquidity needs, buy the  $29 \frac{1}{2}$ -year bonds and sell the 30-year bonds. This position generates a profit if and when the yields on the two bonds converge, as typically happens when aging 30-year bonds are no longer the most liquid on-the-run bond and thus not priced at a premium.

This strategy should generate profits regardless of interest rate movements if 30-year bonds underperform the  $291/2$ -year bonds, as they should when the liquidity premium dissipates. Because the pricing discrepancies between these two securities almost necessarily must disappear at a given date, this strategy is an example of convergence arbitrage.

While the convergence date here is not quite as definite as the maturity of a futures contract, the current on-the-run T-bonds will lose that status when the Treasury issues its next 30-year bonds. In contrast, when security analysts think they have found a mispriced stock, they usually acknowledge that it is hard to know how long it will take for price to converge to intrinsic value.

Long-short positions such as in Example 26.1 are characteristic of hedged strategies. They are designed to isolate a bet on some mispricing without taking on market exposure. Profits are made regardless of broad market movements once prices "converge" or return to their "proper" levels. Hence, use of short positions and derivatives is part and parcel of the industry.

A more complex long-short strategy is convertible bond arbitrage, one of the more prominent sectors of the hedge-fund universe. A convertible bond may be viewed as a

Alfred W. Jones is generally credited with starting the first hedge fund in 1949, as well as creating the moniker, calling his product a "hedged fund." Jones, a sociologist and investor, believed he could identify undervalued and overvalued stocks. He pursued a strategy of buying stocks (with leverage) and hedging these positions with short sales. This approach minimized his portfolio beta, thus creating the first market-neutral hedge fund.

straight bond plus a call option on the underlying stock; the market-neutral strategy in this case involves a position in the bond offset by an opposite position in the stock. For example, if the convertible is viewed as underpriced, the fund will buy it and offset its resultant exposure to declines in the stock price by shorting the stock.

Although these market-neutral positions are hedged, they are not risk-free arbitrage strategies. Rather, they should be viewed as pure plays, that is, bets on particular (perceived) mispricing between two sectors or securities, with extraneous sources of risk such as general market exposure hedged away. Moreover, because the funds often operate with considerable leverage, returns can be quite volatile. While traditional asset classes diversify away idiosyncratic risk, hedge funds embrace it to drive abnormal returns while still eliminating systematic risk.

b. The fund purchases shares in ExxonMobil and sells short shares of Chevron.
c. The fund buys shares in Generic Pharmaceuticals, betting that it will be acquired at a premium by Pfizer.

# Statistical Arbitrage

Statistical arbitrage is a version of a market-neutral strategy, but one that merits its own discussion. It differs from pure arbitrage in that it does not exploit risk-free positions based on unambiguous mispricing (such as index arbitrage). Instead, it uses quantitative and often automated trading systems that seek out many temporary and modest misalignments in prices among securities. By taking relatively small positions in many of these opportunities, the law of averages makes the probability of profiting from the collection of apparently positive-value bets very high, ideally almost a "statistical certainty." Of course, this strategy presumes that the fund's modeling techniques can identify reliable, if small, market inefficiencies. The law of averages guarantees profits only if the expected return is positive!

Such rapid heavy trading requires extensive use of quantitative tools such as automated trading and mathematical algorithms to identify profit opportunities and efficient diversification across positions. These strategies require the fastest trading technology and the lowest possible trading costs. They would not be possible without the electronic communication networks discussed in Chapter 3.

One example of statistical arbitrage is pairs trading, in which stocks are paired up based on an analysis of either fundamental similarities or market exposures (betas). The general approach is to match similar companies whose returns are highly correlated but where one company seems to be priced more aggressively than the other.[11] Market-neutral positions can be formed by buying the relatively cheap firm and selling the expensive one. Many such pairs comprise the hedge fund's overall portfolio. Each pair may have an uncertain outcome, but with many such matched pairs, the presumption is that the large number of long-short bets will provide a very high probability of a positive abnormal return. More general versions of pairs trading allow for positions in clusters of stocks that may be relatively mispriced.


Statistical arbitrage is commonly associated with data mining, which refers to sorting through huge amounts of historical data to uncover systematic patterns in returns that can be exploited by traders. The risk of data mining, and statistical arbitrage in general, is that historical relationships may break down when fundamental economic conditions change or, indeed, that the apparent patterns in the data may be due to pure chance. Enough analysis applied to enough data is sure to produce apparent patterns that do not reflect real relationships that will persist in the future.

# High-Frequency Strategies

While statistical arbitrage is facilitated by rapid-trading technology, other hedge fund strategies are absolutely dependent on high-frequency trading. Here are just a few:

Electronic News Feeds Some funds have established electronic news feeds that give them instant access to breaking news such as earnings announcements. Utilizing computerized natural language processing, announcements can be instantly interpreted as good (or bad) news and buy (or sell) orders can be placed immediately. Clearly, the payoff for this sort of strategy depends on being among the first to respond to the news, which makes electronic trading and access to market servers essential.

Cross-Market Arbitrage Very-high-frequency traders can take advantage of temporary discrepancies in security prices across markets, buying in the market where the price is low and selling where it is high. This cross-market arbitrage requires the fastest-possible trading capabilities, as these opportunities are truly fleeting. A special case of this strategy would be index arbitrage (see Chapter 23), where the pricing inconsistency is between the futures and spot markets.

Electronic Market Making Some funds repeatedly post (but frequently cancel) bid and ask prices to profit from the bid-ask spread. Once those prices are posted, however, they are vulnerable to news events that move equilibrium prices outside their bid-ask bounds. If a company is mentioned in a news report, for example, the fund may immediately cancel its posted prices. In this regard, the strategy overlaps with the electronic news feeds mentioned above.

Electronic “Front Running” In this strategy, firms use data on the stream of trades as well as some version of artificial intelligence to infer whether other traders are generally buying or selling. If they conclude other traders are buying, for example, they will also put in a buy order, attempting to purchase shares before other traders have moved the price.

# Portable Alpha

An important implication of the market-neutral pure play is portable alpha. Suppose an investor speculates on a stock thought to be underpriced but believes the market is about to fall. Even if the stock is relatively underpriced, it still might decline in response to declines in the broad market. The investor wants to separate the stock-specific bet from the exposure to the broad market that arises because the stock's beta is positive. The solution is to buy the stock and eliminate the market exposure by selling enough index futures to drive overall beta to zero. This long stock–short futures strategy generates a pure play or, equivalently, a market-neutral position on the stock.


More generally, this is an investment strategy to separate asset allocation from security selection. The idea is to invest wherever alpha can be found, then hedge the systematic risk of that investment to isolate the alpha from its asset market exposure, and, finally, establish whatever exposure to broad market sectors is desired by using passive products such as indexed mutual funds, ETFs, or index futures. This strategy separates the search for alpha from the choice of which market sectors the portfolio ultimately is exposed to. We therefore call it portable alpha. Example 26.2 illustrates. This procedure is also called alpha transfer because the alpha can be transferred from one sector to another or even to another asset class. Finding alpha requires skill. By contrast, beta, or market exposure, is a "standardized commodity" that can be supplied cheaply through index products and does not add value.

# Example 26.2 A Pure Play

You manage a \$2.5 million portfolio. You simultaneously believe it will generate positive alpha ( $\alpha > 0$ ), but the overall market is about to fall. Therefore, you use Equation 26.1 to establish a pure play on the perceived  $\alpha$ . The portfolio return equals its "fair" CAPM return, plus firm-specific risk (e), plus the perceived mispricing ( $\alpha$ ):

$$ r _ {\text {p o r t f o l i o}} = r _ {f} + \beta \left(r _ {M} - r _ {f}\right) + \alpha + e \tag {26.1}
$$

Suppose  $\beta = 1.20$ ,  $\alpha = .02$ ,  $r_f = .01$ , and the S&P 500 index is currently  $S_0 = 4,000$ . For simplicity, assume the portfolio pays no dividends. You can capture the positive alpha of  $2\%$  per month and hedge away the beta exposure of 1.20 by selling a sufficient number of the liquid E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts (with a multiplier of 50), hedged for one month:

$$
\text {H e d g e r a t i o} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 2 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0}{4 , 0 0 0 \times \mathbb {S} 5 0} \times 1. 2 0 = 1 5 \text {c o n t r a c t s}
$$

The dollar value of the stock portfolio after one month will be:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \$ 2,500,000 \times (1 + r _ {\text {p o r t f o l i o}}) = \$ 2,500,000 \times [ 1 + . 0 1 + 1. 2 \times (r _ {m} - . 0 1) + . 0 2 + e ] \\ = \$ 2,545,000 + \$ 3,000,000 \times r _ {M} + \$ 2,500,000 \times e \\ \end{array}
$$

The dollar proceeds from your futures position in one month will be:

Contracts  $\times$  Multiplier  $\times (F_0 - F_1)$
= 15 × 50 × [F₀ - S₁] Mark to market on 15 contracts sold
= \ 750 \times [S_0 \times 1.01 - S_1] Substitute for futures prices from parity relationship
= \ 750 \times [S_0 \times 1.01 - S_0 \times (1 + r_M)] Because S_{1} = S_{0} \times (1 + r_{M}) when no dividends are paid
= \ 750 \times [4,000 \times (.01 - r_M)] Because S_0 = 4,000
$= \$  30,000 - \ $3,000,000 \times r_{M}$  Simplify

Combining these two proceeds, the final value of the hedged position is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {H e d g e d p r o c e e d s} = \text {V a l u e o f s t o c k p o r t i f i o} + \text {F u t u r e s p r o c e e d s} \tag {26.2} \\ = \$ 2,545,000 + \$ 3,000,000 \times r _ {M} + \$ 2,500,000 \times e \\ + \mathbb {S} 3 0, 0 0 0 - \mathbb {S} 3, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 \times r _ {M} \\ = \$ 2,575,000 + \$ 2,500,000 \times e \\ \end{array}
$$

The exposure to the market from the futures position precisely offsets the exposure from the stock portfolio. You have therefore reduced  $\beta$  to 0. Your total return (above the original \$2.5 million investment) is \$75,000 plus the nonsystematic risk. That represents a  $3\%$  expected return on the portfolio, which equals the risk-free rate plus alpha.

A warning: Even hedged market-neutral positions can go very wrong. This is not true arbitrage (defined by the creation of riskless excess returns) because profits still depend on the accuracy of your analysis (perceived alpha). Moreover, a sound strategy can be done in by simple bad luck—the analysis may be correct, but a bad realization of firm-specific risk (a large negative value of  $e$  in Equation 26.2) can still result in losses.[13]

Even market-neutral bets result in considerable volatility because most hedge funds use significant leverage. Incidents of relative mispricing are fairly minor, and the hedged nature of these long-short strategies make the volatility of the pure play low. Hedge funds respond by scaling up their bets. This amplifies gains when their bets work out, but also amplifies losses. In the end, the volatility of the funds is not small.

# 26.3 Venture Capital and Angel Investors

Private equity distinguishes itself as an investable asset class by the type of assets under management. Whether start-ups or public-turned-private corporations, private equity assets are not traded on centralized securities markets such as the NYSE or NASDAQ. Ownership is closely held and changes infrequently. We examine three major categories of private equity—angel investors, venture capital, and leveraged buyouts—though Table 26.2 hints at the variety of the private equity universe. For all private equity firms, the relationship with portfolio companies is temporary. They buy, improve, and then sell or “harvest” those companies through either an acquisition or, hopefully, an IPO. Angel investors and venture capital provide capital infusions for start-ups in exchange for ownership positions.

# Angel Investors

Angel investors are wealthy individuals or families. They can invest on their own or through angel networks, such as Tech Coast Angels, Keiretsu Forum, or CommonAngels. These networks match angels to entrepreneurs. The networks thus diversify angels' portfolios and broaden due diligence. Angels typically invest at the earliest stages of business development; they are often the first infusion of capital after the founders. They commonly invest between  \$50,000 and\$ 100,000, though the amount can vary considerably.

# Table 26.2

Categories of Private Equity*

* PreQin maintains one of the most comprehensive databases on private equity performance.

The process of receiving funding may differ according to each angel, though a typical pattern emerges. Entrepreneurs submit an application, and a screening process eliminates businesses that do not meet certain requirements such as size, industry, geographic region, strategic fit, or other characteristics. Entrepreneurs who make it past the initial screening meet with the angel to present the business model and, if available, a business plan. At this point, the entrepreneurs present the case for funding. If the angel wishes to proceed, due diligence is the next step.

Angel investors recognize that most start-ups fail, so they demand very high expected rates of return (contingent on success) to justify taking on that risk. Because positive free cash flows are rarely present at this point in the start-up's life cycle, discounted cash flow models like the ones developed in Chapter 18 will not be effective in computing value. The angel relies on other valuation models (see Example 26.3 below) to establish acceptable initial funding levels and required ownership.

# Venture Capital

Venture capital (VC) firms are professionally managed money managers that focus on startups. They generally take two forms: The first are independent venture capital funds, such as Kleiner-Perkins, Sequoia Capital, and General Catalyst, which act as stand-alone investment firms. The second, corporate venture capital, is part of a larger corporation and may be viewed as the start-up investment arm of major corporations. Notable examples such as Intel Capital and Google Ventures invest both within as well as outside the parent company's industry.

VCs are typically structured as limited liability partnerships (LLPs) that match general partners (GPs) with limited partners (LPs). GPs control the funds under management, source deals, conduct due diligence, and finance, monitor, and harvest these investments through exits. The LPs provide capital but have limited involvement in the day-to-day operation of the firm, a requirement to maintain their limited liability status. Capital committed by the LPs is used or "drawn down" by the GPs to invest in the start-up companies; at exit, profits are shared between the GPs and LPs.

# Venture Capital and Investment Stages

From its conception as an idea, a business grows through several stages of development. Figure 26.2, Panel A, presents a typical "J-curve" describing start-up growth and cash flow over time. As a start-up begins developing an initial product or service, free cash flows are typically negative, and may remain so for several years. After an entrepreneur has exhausted the capital supplied by friends, family, and angel investors, seed capital marks the first infusion of venture capital. Seed capital focuses primarily on refining the business model, building the prototype of the product, possibly bringing it to market, and beginning to build the entrepreneurial team.

Figure 26.2 Venture Capital Life Cycles; Panel A, Startup life cycle; Panel B, Venture Capital Fund Life Cycle Source (Panel B): Frank Fabozzi, Handbook of Finance Volume 1 (Wiley, 2008) p. 570.


As the business grows and its market share increases, cash flow improves, eventually turning positive. Investments by early-stage venture capital help move prototypes into markets and continue to help develop the firm's operations, including shoring up any management deficiencies. The first and second rounds of VC funding, called A & B rounds, are typically considered early-stage venture capital. Both seed capital and early-stage venture capital focus on operational and corporate governance improvements as well as providing financing.

Rapid expansion of the firm may result in a "cash crunch," where the firm's revenue and profits grow rapidly, but its free cash flow lags. This may reflect weak bargaining power as well as fewer options to raise additional capital. Late-stage venture capital invests in these later rounds, typically C & D, to ameliorate any cash crunch and to further expand the start-up, with an increasing eye towards exit. Late-stage VCs put a greater emphasis on financing, though some operational improvements undoubtedly occur.

# Fund Life Cycle

The vintage year is the first year of the venture fund, typically when raised capital is first deployed. A fund's lifespan is typically 10-12 years. Figure 26.2, Panel B, illustrates the relationship between time and fund value. A fund begins its life by raising capital; GPs meet with potential LPs to build a case for funding. In 2020, the average fund size was  \$229 million, but the median fund size was smaller, at\$ 75 million. Mega-funds, such as those raised by Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global Management, exceed 1 billion and pull the average away from the median.[16]

One venture capital firm will likely have several funds, often running simultaneously. Often the LPs have committed capital to previous funds, and it is common to see one LP invested in multiple funds of the same venture capital firm. Re-upping investments with proceeds from previous funds can be viewed as analogous to reinvesting dividends.

Once capital is raised, the VCs begin identifying start-ups and conducting due diligence. When selecting deals, VCs will look at the business model, the product or technology, and the management team. A survey of VCs shows that management team  $(47\%)$  is the most important consideration when sourcing a deal, outranking the business model  $(10\%)$  and even the actual product  $(13\%)!^{17}$

At the conclusion of successful due diligence, the VC and the entrepreneur draw up a term sheet, or written agreement specifying the deal structure. Details of the agreement include stock type, dividends, voting rights, capital invested, ownership, liquidation preferences, anti-dilution measures (so future rounds of financing do not eliminate VC ownership), and any other protective provisions for both parties. Money is then drawn down from the fund's committed capital and invested into the start-up.

Because there is an inherent information asymmetry between the VC and the founder who actually runs the start-up, the VC must monitor the entrepreneur's spending. An entrepreneur, flush with cash from a round of financing, may not exhibit discipline in cash expenditures. The technology boom of the late 1990s provides many examples of excessive venture cash consumption, or burn rate. Venture funding flooded technology companies, often without imposing necessary discipline on the entrepreneurs, and many LP dollars were lost. These agency costs are associated with newer start-ups and start-ups that rely heavily on intangible assets and R&D in general.[18]

Higher agency costs imply higher monitoring costs. One effective monitoring solution is staged financing—disbursing committed capital in smaller infusions over time. This allows the financiers to monitor burn rates, infuse fiscal discipline, and redirect capital away from start-ups that are failing. Even with this financial discipline, Figure 26.3 demonstrates growth in average deal size, sorted by VC stage.

Successful exits from portfolio companies generate returns for venture capitalists and their limited partners and represent the end of the fund's life. There are three types of exits: initial public offerings (IPOs), acquisitions, and write-offs. IPO exits are typically the most profitable and therefore most desired of the exits. The median venture fund exits through IPO about  $20 - 30\%$  of the time.[19]

Acquisitions (and mergers) account for about  $25 - 37\%$  of exits. Typically, a larger firm acquires the start-up, either to eliminate emerging competition or to acquire a target firm's research and development expertise. The remaining exits are liquidations and subsequent write-offs. Liquidation value is rarely sufficient to cover outstanding liabilities, so write-offs typically generate returns on invested capital of  $-100\%$ .

Notice the similarity in shape between Figure 26.2 Panels A and B. This is no coincidence. The long period of negative cash flows ultimately followed by positive ones demonstrates that the fund life cycle parallels the firm life cycle.

# Private Equity Valuation

A challenging task for all private equity investors is the determination of value. For the VC, value determines the required ownership per dollar invested. Entrepreneurs face the converse problem—ownership given up per dollar invested. While underlying laws of supply and demand still apply, our "go-to" models like the Capital Asset Pricing Model and the Dividend Discount Model are not easily implemented in this arena. Private equity does not enjoy high-volume trading where buyers and sellers arrive at equilibrium prices. This makes valuation imprecise, inaccurate, and inefficient compared to public markets (though the public market equivalent method is promising for benchmarking; it compares private equity to similarly risked public equity).

Despite these challenges, there are some battle-worn approaches used by fund managers to approximate initial required ownership. Entrepreneurship is inherently risky, and VCs require a high potential rate of return to justify that risk. One popular approach is based on a capital multiplier, that is, the projected terminal value of a start-up expressed as a multiple of the VC's initial investment. That multiplier also determines the fractional ownership a VC may demand of the start-up.

The VC's ownership share at the time of exit is the ratio of its final value (which is forecasted as the initial investment times a capital multiplier) to the expected total value of the firm at that time:

$$
\text {T e r m i n a l} = \frac {\text {I n i t i a l} \times \text {C a p i t a l} \text {m u l t i p l i e r}}{\text {F o r c a s t} \text {t e r m i n a l} \text {v a l u e}} \tag {26.3}
$$

However, if the VC anticipates dilution of its ownership share due to future rounds of financing, its initial share must be higher than this terminal share. Example 26.3 illustrates both the baseline calculation as well as the impact of dilution in future rounds. These calculations rely on highly uncertain forecasts. Incomplete information, lack of transparency, and lack of an active market of willing buyers and sellers create great imprecision. The final value will almost certainly not equal the initial calculations.

# Example 26.3 VC Equity Share and Dilution

You are an early-stage venture capitalist conducting due diligence on a biotech start-up. You are willing to contribute  $2,000,000 (v_{\text{Initial}})$  in the first round of financing, and you target a final exit value of  $10 \times$  Initial capital. You estimate exit to take place (roughly) in eight years. You expect an additional round of financing in four years in which you will not participate that will dilute your ownership share to  $50\%$ . You project that the firm can be sold for  $\$ 90,000,000$  ( $v_{\text{Terminal}}$ ) in eight years. What equity position must you require for your investment? What must be your initial valuation of the company excluding the amount of your investment?

To find the required equity position, let us work back from the terminal valuation. Your terminal ultimate ownership share of the firm,  $w_{\text{Terminal}}$ , must be your targeted dollar payout expressed as a fraction of the total terminal value of the firm. Using the return requirement (the capital multiplier) and the projected terminal value of 90,000,000, this ratio is:


$$
W _ {\text {Terminal}} = \frac {V _ {\text {Initial}} \times \text {Capital multiplier}}{V _ {\text {Terminal}}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 2,000,000 \times 10}{\mathbb {S} 90,000,000} = . 2 2 2 2, \text {or} 2 2. 2 2
$$

This baseline calculation thus implies a required ownership share of  $22.22\%$  at the time of exit.

However, you believe there will be at least one round of financing between your initial commitment and final value. Because your initial ownership share will be diluted by  $50\%$ , your initial ownership position,  $w_{\text{initial}}$ , must be:

$$ w _ {\text {Initial}} = \frac {w _ {\text {Terminal}}}{1 - \text {Dilution}} = \frac {.2222}{1 - .50} = .4444, \text {or} 44.44 \%
$$

Using this initial ownership share and your initial investment ( \$2 million), you can now back out the post-round valuation of the firm. The value of the firm after you make your investment (the post-round value) must be enough to equate the value of your ownership share to the\$ 2 million you are investing:

$$ w _ {\text {I n i t i a l}} \times v _ {\text {I n i t i a l}} = . 4 4 4 4 \times v _ {\text {I n i t i a l}} = \$ 2 \text {m i l l o n}
$$

$$ v _ {\text {I n i t i a l}} = \$ 2 \text {m i l l o n / . 4 4 4 4} = \$ 4. 5 \text {m i l l o n}
$$

This implies that the value of the firm net of your \$2 million investment (i.e., the pre-round valuation) must be \$4.5 million – \$2.0 million = \$2.5 million.

a. What is the initial ownership required if there are two subsequent rounds of financing, diluting initial shares by  $25\%$  each round?
b. What is the initial ownership if the VC commits to investing sufficient capital in every subsequent round to maintain the initial  $22.22\%$  ownership share?

# Venture Syndication

Like IPO underwriters, venture capitalists often syndicate with one another. There are several reasons for this. First, if a fund extends an offer to syndicate to another VC, it hopes for reciprocity in the future. Syndication also acts as a signaling mechanism—because start-ups are extremely risky, pooled investments signal widespread optimism about the potential for good exits[20] and allow for the addition of sector-specific expertise. Such expertise can be distributed across the syndicate, providing a convenient way to diversify otherwise concentrated portfolios.[21]

If syndication allows better deal sourcing and better monitoring, then it should result in better fund performance and a higher percentage of funds that successfully exit.

Hochberg et al.[22] demonstrate that syndication does predict better fund outcomes, measured in terms of the number and quality of relationships as well as internal rate of return. In addition, at every round of financing, syndication improves the probability of the firm surviving to the next round. Finally, VCs that syndicate generate higher rates of IPOs and acquisitions for their portfolio companies. Well-connected venture capitalists lead to better results, particularly when they team up with other well-connected VCs.

# Venture Capital and Innovation

Besides technology, what do Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Intel, Microsoft, and Yahoo! have in common? They were all venture-capital-backed start-ups. Nearly half of all FDA-approved drugs in the last decade began with venture funding.[23] Does private equity engender innovation, or does innovation cause capital to flow to angels and VCs? This was one of the unanswered questions in the 2001 field-shaping research of Gompers and Lerner.[24] Since then, the flow of causality has been clarified considerably for both venture capital and angels.

One study showed that angel investing has a causal impact on the performance of start-ups.[25] The impact stems from a combination of intense monitoring, value-added services, and structured control rights (anti-dilution measures) that protect the ability of the angel to continue to influence the development of the firm. The authors compare otherwise similar angel- and non-angel-backed start-ups. Start-ups with a critical mass of angel backing are more likely to survive at least four years and have a successful exit. These firms have more employees, hold more patents, and grow faster. Angel-funded companies obtain better financing in later rounds and are more likely to connect with syndicated venture funding.

Like angel-backed start-ups, VC-backed firms are associated with significantly higher levels of intellectual property. Kortum and Lerner $^{26}$  show that increased venture activity is associated with a rise in patent rates. They show that the inflow of VC funding is associated with improved industrial innovation. They also observe the impact of venture capital on the patent-research and development (R&D) ratio (patents issued per dollar of R&D) and find that a dollar of venture funding is three times more likely to generate a patent than a dollar of traditional corporate R&D. While VC funding was only about  $3\%$  of corporate R&D, it generated  $8\%$  of patents from 1983-1992.

Since the 1990s, the influence of VCs on innovation has only increased. Gornall and Strebulaev[27] concluded that venture capital-backed companies account for  $62\%$  of publicly traded U.S. companies' R&D spending and  $41\%$  of total market capitalization. VCs were early investors in  $20\%$  of the 300 largest U.S. public companies. Lerner and Nanda[28] show that

venture capital funded almost half of all firms that eventually went public. Of the 4,109 IPOs between 1995 and 2019 that they reviewed,  $47\%$  had venture funding. Additionally,  $57\%$  of VC-backed firms were still publicly traded in 2019. In contrast, the public survival rate for non-venture-backed IPOs for that period was only  $21\%$ .

However, Lerner and Nanda caution that venture capital may be optimized for a "narrow slice of technological innovation." Specifically, the standard 10-year fund life fits well with the life cycle of software and other technologies with relatively short development times. As new industries take center stage, will they shape the way VCs structure their funds or will altogether new investment vehicles emerge to support different forms of innovation? It is uncertain if we are at the zenith of venture capital's role in creating innovation or if there is still room to grow.

# 26.4 Leveraged Buyout Funds

While angels and venture capitalists invest in start-ups, leveraged buyout funds (LBOs) operate on the other side of a company's life cycle. Private equity firms such as KKR, Blackstone, and Warburg Pincus seek publicly traded firms with stable cash flows that may be underperforming. LBOs use massive amounts of debt to finance the purchase of all the publicly traded firm's equity. The public firm is now privately owned by the LBO, whose intent is to improve governance, operations, and financial structure. Like angels and VCs, LBOs seek an exit through an IPO or acquisition, typically within five to seven years of the initial purchase.

# Leveraged Buyout Firm Structure

Also like VC funds, LBO funds are typically organized as limited partnerships with a typical fund life of 10 years, though extensions can be written into the limited partnership agreement. The fund operates as a closed-end vehicle, with all the illiquidity that entails. Limited partners who supply capital to the fund include the usual suspects: institutional investors and wealthy individuals.[29] GPs control how committed capital is invested subject to some protective covenants. For example, the maximum percent of the total fund that can be invested in any one company may be limited.

# The Deal

LBOs seem to target companies with some common characteristics. They are often mature companies with reasonably stable cash flows, though they may be currently underperforming. Targets are at a stage of development where there are relatively limited capital expenditures, the capital structure does not heavily favor debt, and many of the assets are marketable. Other factors, like barriers to entry, threat of substitution, regulatory risk, and historical performance, may provide insight into the firm (Chapter 17 discusses some of these factors). These characteristics have one important feature in common: debt capacity, or the potential to generate sufficient cash flow to pay down the leverage taken on by the LBO in the purchase.

Once the LBO fund identifies a target, it will make an offer on the outstanding stock, typically at a premium of  $15 - 50\%$  over the current stock price.[30] The offer is funded by about  $10 - 40\%$  equity drawn down from the fund and  $60 - 90\%$  debt (the leverage).

The debt will typically include a mixture of senior and secured debt as well as junior and unsecured debt, often in the form of high-yield bonds.

When the fund takes control of the firm, the control structure shifts drastically. While public ownership is widely dispersed among shareholders, private ownership is highly concentrated. This provides formidable incentives for success. The highly levered position forces an environment of fiscal discipline: Sufficient EBITDA must be generated to cover the debt service. The very structure of the deal seeks to minimize agency problems, which should lead to leaner, more profitable operations.

The LBO fund attempts to implement structural changes that improve the odds of a successful exit. The firm will work with management (old or new, depending on the specifics of the buyout) to improve governance. The heavy debt burden forces managers to be fiscally prudent. LBOs encourage productivity improvements through merit-based compensation, promotions, and hiring. The aims comprise the twin goals of growth and debt reduction. If successful, they will generate higher equity value realized at exit, as Example 26.4 illustrates.

# Example 26.4 Measuring LBO Returns

Lexington & Goldman (L&G) is a buyout fund that wishes to purchase a regional telecom firm. This firm generates steady cash flows but has recently fallen on hard times. The stock currently trades at \$42 per share with 20,000,000 shares outstanding. L&G offers \$50 per share to purchase the company outright. The offer is funded by 25\% equity from L&G's committed capital and 75\% by high-yield debt securities. The LBO believes it can work with management to grow the firm at a rate of about 6\% while reducing the proportion of capital structure composed of debt by 5 percentage points each year. The fund hopes to exit by the sixth year.

While equity originally accounts for only  $25\%$  of capital structure, by year 6 that value is expected to rise to  $25\% + 6 \times 5\% = 55\%$ . Figure 26.4 shows capital structure in a few select years.

What is the expected IRR of this investment? First, we calculate the value of the firm in year 6, accounting for its expected  $6\%$  growth rate:

$$
V _ {0} = \ 5 0 \times 2 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 = \ 1, 0 0 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0
$$

$$
V _ {6} = \\mathbb {1}, 0 0 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 \times 1. 0 6 ^ {6} = \\mathbb {1}, 4 1 8, 5 1 9, 1 1 2
$$

To find the IRR of the LBO investment, we derive the expected value of equity in year 6. The firm will be worth  $V_{6} = \1,418,519,112$  and the equity share of capital structure is forecast at 55\%, implying equity value of  $.55 \times \$ 1,418,519,112 = \$780,185,512 . These inputs allow us to solve for the LBO's internal rate of return:

$$
E _ {0} = \frac {E _ {T}}{(1 + I R R) ^ {T}}
$$

The discounted value of the future equity position

$$
\$ 250,000,000 = \frac {\$ 780 , 1 8 5 , 5 1 2}{(1 + I R R) ^ {6}}
$$

Solve for the internal rate of return

$$
I R R = 20.89 \%
$$

# Concept Check 26.4

Why do LBOs use massive amounts of debt in their acquisitions? Suppose an LBO acquires a firm for  \$25,000,000 and exits five years later by selling the firm for\$ 48,000,000. Find the IRR for debt-to-equity ratios of  $D / E = 0$ , 1, and 4 in the initial investment. For simplicity, assume the final amount of debt equals the initial value of debt (in other words, only debt service was being paid annually during the term of the investment).

# Exits

The goal of the LBO is a successful exit from each of its privately held firms through either an IPO or acquisition. If the now-private firm exits LBO ownership by IPO, it does so as a new firm, legally distinct from its previous public identity. For the period of 1970-2007, about  $14\%$  of exits were by IPO.[31] However, this average has fallen from the highs in the 1980s. IPO exits are highly dependent on the strength of the broader IPO market.

Kaplan and Strömberg calculate about  $38\%$  of LBO portfolio companies are sold to a strategic buyer (a more traditional acquisition), while  $24\%$  are acquired in a second buyout. Around  $1\%$  are sold to their management (in a so-called management buyout) and  $5\%$  to another LBO-backed firm. About  $6\%$  declare bankruptcy and the rest have unknown fates because data collection is inherently challenging in this arena.

# Leveraged Buyouts and Innovation

In 1989, Michael Jensen published an important article titled "Eclipse of the Public Corporation," where he laid out a compelling case for the advantages of private equity (among other nonpublic organizations) over publicly traded firms. He cited as beneficial the concentration of ownership, stricter governance, stronger fiscal discipline engendered by a debt-heavy capital structure, and the subsequent decrease in agency problems. These characteristics would, he argued, lead to improved "operating efficiency, employee productivity, and shareholder value." The article was published at the height of the LBO boom in the 1980s, but just a few short years later, the high-yield bond market crashed, reducing LBO presence for many years. However, markets ebb and flow, including the market for leveraged buyouts.

Does a strong LBO market stimulate innovation in a similar manner as venture capital? A 2011 study by Lerner et al.33 concludes that private equity capital is followed

by periods of increased patent quality, as measured by the number of citations. $^{34}$  Also, patents in the firm's primary area of expertise (or core business) increased after the infusion of private equity. These findings suggest that LBOs refocus a company on its original areas of expertise, fortifying its comparative advantages while increasing value and innovation.

# 26.5 Performance Measurement for Alternative Investment Funds

Performance measurement and benchmarking for alternative assets are more challenging than for traditional asset classes. The closely held nature of alternative investments, combined with illiquidity and several reporting biases, muddy performance measures.

# Liquidity and Performance

One of the more important extensions of the CAPM allows for the possibility of a return premium for investors willing to hold less-liquid assets.[35] Compared to traditional mutual funds, alternative asset investors tend to hold more illiquid assets, either by strategy (e.g., hedge funds) or by nature (e.g., venture capital). Additionally, restrictions such as lock-up provisions, which are a time period in which LPs cannot redeem or sell invested capital, increase illiquidity. Therefore, part of the performance of alternative investment funds potentially reflects liquidity premia. If ignored, compensation for illiquidity may appear as true alpha (risk-adjusted abnormal returns). As we will now see, the evidence suggests that these premia are not trivial.

Liquidity and Hedge Fund Performance Aragon demonstrates that hedge funds with lock-up restrictions tend to hold less liquid portfolios. When he controlled for lock-ups or other share restrictions (such as redemption notice periods), the apparently positive average alpha of those funds turned insignificant. Aragon's work suggests that part of any "alpha" exhibited by hedge funds may be an equilibrium liquidity premium rather than a sign of stock-picking ability—a "fair" reward for providing liquidity to other investors.

Positive serial correlation means that positive returns are more likely to be followed by positive than by negative returns, a pattern often taken as an indicator of less liquid markets for the following reason. When prices are not available because an asset is not actively traded, the hedge fund must estimate its value to calculate net asset value and rates of return. However, such procedures are at best imperfect. As demonstrated by Getmansky, Lo, and Makarov,[37] they tend to result in serial correlation in prices as firms either smooth out their value estimates or only gradually mark prices to true market values. Positive serial correlation is therefore often interpreted as evidence of liquidity problems; in nearly efficient markets with frictionless trading, we would expect serial correlation or other predictable patterns in prices to be minimal.

34The authors argue that "citations either to or by the patent . . . are extremely important in patent filings, since they serve as 'property markers' . . ."
35See Chapter 9.

Hasanhodzic and  $\mathrm{Lo}^{38}$  find that hedge fund returns generally tend to exhibit significant serial correlation. This evidence of price smoothing has two important implications. First, it lends further support to the hypothesis that hedge funds hold less liquid assets and that part of their average returns may reflect liquidity premiums. Second, it implies that their risk-adjusted performance measures are upward-biased because any smoothing in the estimates of portfolio value will reduce measured volatility (thereby increasing the Sharpe ratio) as well as measured covariances and, therefore, betas with systematic factors (thereby increasing measured risk-adjusted alphas).

While Aragon focuses on the average level of liquidity,  $\text{Sadka}^{39}$  addresses the liquidity risk of hedge funds. He shows that exposure to unexpected declines in market liquidity is an important determinant of average hedge fund returns and that the spread in average returns across the funds with the highest and lowest liquidity exposure may be as much as  $6\%$  annually. Hedge fund performance may therefore reflect significant compensation for liquidity risk; see Figure 26.5 for a graphical representation.

Performance can be even more difficult to interpret if a hedge fund takes advantage of illiquid markets to manipulate returns by purposely misvaluing illiquid assets. On average, reported hedge fund returns in December have been substantially greater than average returns in other months.[40] The pattern is stronger for lower-liquidity funds and funds that are near or beyond the threshold return at which performance incentive fees kick in. It appears that some funds use their discretion in valuing assets to move returns to December to enhance their annual incentive fees. It also seems that some hedge funds attempt to manipulate their measured performance by buying additional shares in stocks they already own to push up prices.[41] The buying takes place just before market close at the end of the

month when hedge fund performance is reported. Moreover, the effort is concentrated in less liquid stocks where the price impact would be expected to be greater. If, as these papers suggest, funds take advantage of illiquid markets to manage returns, then accurate performance measurement becomes almost impossible.

Liquidity and Private Equity Several features contribute to the illiquidity of LBO and VC investments. Portfolio companies take years to develop and mature. Because the securities held are not traded in any public market, the exit itself is also an illiquid process whether by acquisition, secondary buyout, or IPO. Even after the exit, there are often covenants in the IPO offering to spread out the actual sale of the now-public securities by the private equity fund.

This illiquidity, combined with management and incentive fees (discussed below), implies that GPs need to generate considerable returns to sufficiently compensate their LPs on a risk-adjusted basis. Accounting for typical management and incentive fees and the liquidity premium over equivalent public securities, private equity fund managers need to generate between  $2.06\%$  and  $3.08\%$  alpha per year to adequately compensate investors.[42]

# Survivorship Bias and Backfill Bias

Because hedge funds and private equity are not compelled to report performance to the SEC (and therefore the public), two important biases may distort reported returns. Survivorship bias arises when unsuccessful funds that cease operation stop reporting returns and exit a database, leaving behind the performance only of successful funds. The effect is potentially large; for example, Malkiel and Saha[43] find that attrition rates for hedge funds are commonly more than double the attrition rate of mutual funds. Estimates of survivorship bias in various studies are typically substantial, in the range of  $2 - 4\%$ .[44]

Backfill bias arises when fund managers fail to report returns on all funds to database publishers. Funds started with seed capital eventually will open to the public. But they enter standard databases only if their past performance is deemed sufficiently successful to attract clients. Thus, prior performance of funds that find their way into the sample may not be representative of typical performance. Like survivorship bias, the effects of this bias can be large. Malkiel and Saha estimate returns were  $5\%$  higher when including backfilled data.

# Tail Events

Imagine a hedge fund's entire investment strategy is to hold an S&P 500 index fund and write deep out-of-the-money put options on it. The strategy brings in a modest premium from the written puts, which contributes to total performance. Only rarely will these puts impose a loss. While market crashes like the one in October 1987 may result in losses of multiples of the entire cumulative gain, if luck allows the fund to avoid these rare but extreme tail events,[45] the strategy appears gilded. The fund manager brings no skill to the

job, but investment results over limited periods might fool an investor into thinking that the manager is extremely talented. The problem in interpreting strategies with such exposure is that crashes or other extreme tail events occur very infrequently, so decades of results may be needed to fully appreciate their true risk and reward attributes.

In three influential books, Nassim Taleb, $^{46}$  a hedge fund operator himself, argues that many hedge funds are analogous to our hypothetical manager, racking up fame and fortune through strategies that make money most of the time but expose investors to rare but extreme losses. Taleb uses the metaphor of the black swan to discuss the importance of highly improbable, but highly impactful, events. $^{47}$  Taleb argues that black swans shape the world, and they simply could not have been predicted from the range of accumulated experience to date. The October 1987 crash, the financial crisis of 2008-2009, and the economic fallout of the COVID pandemic might be viewed as black swans—most market observers would have dismissed them as virtually impossible beforehand, but all three were highly impactful. These events caution investors to show humility when relying on past experience to evaluate future risk. Example 26.5 illustrates.

# Example 26.5 Tail Events and Long Term Capital Management

In the late 1990s, Long Term Capital Management was widely viewed as the most successful hedge fund in history. It had consistently provided double-digit returns to its investors, and it had earned hundreds of millions of dollars in incentive fees for its managers. The firm used sophisticated statistical models to estimate correlations across assets and believed that its capital was almost 10 times the annual standard deviation of its portfolio returns, presumably enough to withstand any "possible" shock to capital (at least, assuming normal distributions!).

But in the summer of 1998, things went badly. On August 17, 1998, Russia defaulted on its sovereign debt and threw capital markets into chaos. LTCM's 1-day loss on August 21 was \$550 million (approximately nine times its estimated monthly standard deviation). Total losses in August were about \$1.3 billion, despite the fact that LTCM believed that most of its positions were market-neutral relative-value trades. Losses accrued on virtually all of its positions, flying in the face of the presumed diversification of the overall portfolio.

How did this happen? The answer lies in the massive flight to quality and, even more so, to liquidity that was set off by the Russian default. LTCM was typically a seller of liquidity (holding less liquid assets, selling more liquid assets with lower yields, and earning the yield spread) and suffered huge losses. This was a different type of shock from those that appeared in its historical sample/modeling period. In the liquidity crisis that engulfed asset markets, the unexpected commonality of liquidity risk across usually uncorrelated asset classes became obvious. Losses that seemed statistically impossible on past experience had in fact come to pass; LTCM fell victim to a black swan.

# Historical Hedge Fund Performance

Figure 26.6 shows the performance of several hedge fund strategies using the S&P 500 as a benchmark. Panel A presents a "differential Sharpe ratio" equal to each strategy's Sharpe ratio minus that of S&P 500 over four consecutive but nonoverlapping 5-year periods starting in 2002.

In their experience, the black swan was outside the realm of reasonable possibility—in statistical jargon, an extreme outlier relative to their sample of observations.

While Sharpe ratios in the initial period (2002-2006) were excellent, nearly every strategy since then has exhibited far lower or even negative differential risk-adjusted returns. Accounting for possible value smoothing (which can produce upward bias in both Sharpe ratios and alphas), actual performance may have been even worse than the disappointing outcomes reported in Panel A.

Of course, it usually will be inappropriate to judge hedge fund performance using Sharpe ratios. These funds are not intended to be candidates for the investor's complete portfolio, but rather are almost always part of a larger collection of investments. Therefore, Panel B displays alphas and Panel C information ratios. These results paint performance in a much better light. Most alphas (and therefore information ratios) are positive for each 5-year period.

On the other hand, it also appears that for most hedge-fund strategies, performance in recent years has not been as strong as it was in the earlier period. Perhaps this result should have been anticipated. Strategies that were novel and successful in the 2002-2006 period would be expected to elicit copy-cat products from competing funds. As more funds crowd into any strategy, their actions would move prices and reduce profit opportunities. This is the familiar dynamic of a market that discovers and progressively competes away any pricing inefficiencies uncovered by an initial cohort of innovative investors.

# Style Analysis

Style analysis (introduced in Chapter 24) uses regression analysis to measure the exposure of a portfolio to various factors or asset classes. The betas on a set of factors measure the fund's exposure to each source of systematic risk. While a market-neutral fund will have no sensitivity to an index for that market, it may have significant betas, or loading, on other factors, such as credit conditions. Directional funds will exhibit significant betas on factors on which the fund tends to bet. We present a simple style analysis for the hedge fund indexes in Table 26.3. The four systematic factors we consider are:

Equity markets: the return on the market index.
- Credit conditions: the difference in the returns of Baa-rated bonds versus Treasury bonds.
- Interest rates: the excess return on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds.
- Foreign exchange: the percentage change in the value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies.

The excess returns on hedge fund index  $i$  in month  $t$  may be statistically described by

$$
R _ {i t} = \alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {i 1} \text {F a c t o r} 1 _ {t} + \dots + \beta_ {i 4} \text {F a c t o r} 4 _ {t} + e _ {i t} \tag {26.4}
$$

The betas (equivalently, factor loadings) measure the sensitivity to each factor. The residual,  $e_{it}$ , measures nonsystematic risk uncorrelated with the set of explanatory factors, and the intercept,  $\alpha_{i}$ , measures the average excess return of fund  $i$  net of the impact of these systematic factors.

Table 26.3 presents factor exposure estimates for several hedge fund indexes. The results confirm that most funds are in fact directional, with very clear exposures to

one or more of the factors. The estimated factor betas seem reasonable in terms of the funds' stated style. Some examples:

- The market-neutral funds have uniformly low and statistically insignificant factor betas, as one would expect of a market-neutral posture.
Distressed-firm funds have significant exposure to credit conditions (more positive credit spreads in this table indicate better economic conditions). This exposure arises because restructuring activities often depend on access to borrowing.
- Fixed-income arbitrage funds also show positive exposure to the differential return on corporate versus Treasury bonds.

We conclude that, by and large, most hedge funds are making very explicit directional bets on a wide array of economic factors.

Performance of VC and LBO funds have varied widely across vintage years. Table 26.4 presents their internal rates of return by vintage year.[49] The arithmetic average fund returns for VCs and LBOs are  $14.09\%$  and  $18.92\%$ , respectively. But if each vintage year is weighted by the capitalization for that year, the average returns increase to  $15.26\%$  and  $19.31\%$ . LBO standard deviation is low compared to that of VCs, suggesting a good reward-to-risk ratio.

Fund performance not surprisingly correlates with the strength of IPO markets when funds exit their portfolio companies. Because most funds have an average lifespan

between 10 and 14 years, $^{50}$  vintage year is both a performance predictor and a benchmark tool. McKenzie and Janeway $^{51}$  conclude that IPO market conditions at the time of exit are the key determinant of fund performance.

Venture capital returns are generated when the fund exits from portfolio companies. Figure 26.7 shows annualized performance by asset class for 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods compared to the S&P 500.[52] Both asset classes outperform the S&P 500 in every period, though their illiquidity and reliance on IPO markets for exits suggest they do better as components of a broader portfolio rather than as stand-alone investments.

Grandstanding As noted earlier, the initial public offering is usually the most profitable exit, often by orders of magnitude. A single initial public offering can drive the returns of an entire fund and secure capital for multiple future funds. The tremendous pressure to generate an IPO can incentivize VC funds to bring companies to market too early. This practice, known as grandstanding, has been well documented, with more IPO underpricing for companies backed by younger VCs. Younger VCs sit on their portfolio companies' boards of directors for a significantly shorter length of time by the time of the IPO. They also time the IPO to match fund-raising for follow-on funds.[53] While this might benefit the VCs in the short run, grandstanding damages the prospects of success for firms brought to market too early and may damage the VC's reputation in the long run.

Industry Specialization VCs can be either generalists or industry-specific specialists. For example, a biotech industry specialist fund will invest only in biotech entrepreneurs. In contrast, a generalist fund may purposely seek industry diversification or may be agnostic

to industry, focusing on other desirable characteristics, like defendable intellectual property or the potential to disrupt current markets.

Do specialists or generalists tend to perform better? One measure of this might be how their portfolio companies perform after exiting the fund. Start-ups brought public through an IPO remain public unless the firm is delisted by the stock exchange (or acquired by another firm). Survival as a publicly listed firm is positively correlated with venture backing overall, but VCs that specialize in one industry have produced firms that survived (i.e., remained listed) about  $14\%$  longer than generalist VC-backed firms.[54] In addition, industry-specializing VCs back IPOs with better historical rates of return and defy the tendency of IPOs to underperform the S&P 500 after listing. VC specialization suggests a depth of industry knowledge that provides an advantage in identifying disruptive or high-quality start-ups.

# Efficient Frontier

In Chapter 25, we saw that adding international equity to the universe of investable assets shifts the efficient frontier up and left, producing a capital allocation line (CAL) with a higher Sharpe ratio. In a similar fashion, adding alternative asset classes to the set of available securities shifts the efficient frontier even further. Alternative assets have low correlation with public securities. Some alternatives, particularly VC and LBO, can be return engines that greatly improve the expected return of a diversified portfolio.

To demonstrate this, we expand the investable universe to include not only domestic equity (S&P 500 Index) and international equity (EAFE), but also hedge funds, venture capital, leveraged buyouts, real estate, and natural resources. With some moderate restrictions, including minimum  $(5\%)$  and maximum  $(20\%)$  allocation limits, the results are a steeper CAL, as Figure 26.8 demonstrates. The optimal portfolio (tangent to the highest CAL) generates a Sharpe ratio of .44 compared to the S&P 500's Sharpe ratio of .28. Even the minimum-variance portfolio generates a Sharpe ratio of .33, still greater than the S&P 500.

# 26.6 Fee Structure in Alternative Investments

# Incentive Fees

The typical hedge fund and private equity fee structure includes an annual management fee of  $1 - 3\%$  of assets under management plus an incentive fee equal to  $20\%$  of investment profits beyond a stipulated benchmark performance. Figure 26.9 illustrates the incentive fee for a fund with a  $20\%$  incentive fee and a hurdle rate equal to the money market rate,  $r_f$ . The current value of the portfolio is denoted  $S_0$  and its year-end value is  $S_T$ . The manager gets the fee if the portfolio value rises sufficiently but loses nothing if it falls. Therefore, the incentive fee is equivalent to .20 call option on the portfolio with a strike price equal to current portfolio value times  $(1 + \text{benchmark return})$ , i.e.,  $S_0 \times (1 + r_f)$ .

This suggests that the value of the incentive fee can be estimated using an option pricing model. Example 26.6 illustrates.

# Example 26.6 Black-Scholes Valuation of Incentive Fees

Suppose the standard deviation of a hedge fund's annual rate of return is 30\% and the incentive fee is 20\% of any investment return over the risk-free money market rate. If the portfolio currently has a net asset value of 100 per share and the effective annual risk-free rate is 5\% (or 4.88\% expressed as a continuously compounded rate), then the implicit exercise price on the incentive fee is \$ 105. The Black-Scholes value of a call option with S_0 = 100, X = 105, \sigma = .30, r_{cc} = .0488, T = 1 year is \$ 11.92, just a shade below 12\% of net asset value. Because the incentive fee is worth 20\% of the call option, its value is just about 2.4\% of net asset value. Together with a typical management fee of 2\% of net asset value, the investor in the fund pays annual fees with a hefty total value of 4.4\% of assets under management.

The major complication to this description of the typical compensation structure is the high-water mark. If a fund experiences significant loss, it may not be able to charge an incentive fee unless and until it recovers to its previous higher value. With large losses, this may be difficult. A high-water mark therefore incentivizes managers to ramp up risk (which makes their implicit call option more valuable) or shut down funds that have performed poorly. This is likely one cause of the high attrition rate exhibited by hedge funds.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/35e9f60841be32d4b1b69ede9b77ebf5e1407105fbf2252154b783e934ee1f6e.jpg)
Figure 26.9 Incentive fees as a call option. The current value of the portfolio is denoted  $S_0$  and its year-end value is  $S_T$ . The incentive fee is equivalent to .20 call option on the portfolio with exercise price  $S_0(1 + r_f)$ .


# Private Equity Chasing Waterfalls

While both hedge funds and private equity funds face high-water marks, private equity has an additional layer of complexity when calculating manager compensation and fund performance. GPs return capital to LPs when portfolio companies are exited. The returns LPs ultimately receive are governed by the distribution waterfall, which specifies the priority of these cash flows. The first distributions flow  $100\%$  towards the LP until invested capital is returned. The next tier is an agreed-upon hurdle rate, also referred to as a preferred return, that is promised to the LP before any incentive fee is taken by the GP. Hurdle rates are typically  $8\%$ . This tier also flows entirely towards the LPs. After this rate is satisfied, GPs begin collecting carried interest through use of a catch-up provision. This provision allows the GP to collect a larger percentage of distributions until the average increases to reflect the original LP/GP split (typically  $80\% / 20\%$ ). The GP catch-up is typically very high,  $80\%$  or more being common. Once the GP catches up to its promised share, remaining distributions typically go  $80\%$  to LPs and  $20\%$  to GPs. Finally, LPs sometimes have the right to reclaim part of the GP's carried interest in the event of severe losses after GPs have received distributions. This provision is called a clawback and is deployed when subsequent losses mean the GPs have received excess compensation.[55]

# Funds of Funds

A notable fraction of the hedge fund universe, and even some private equity, is invested in funds of funds, which are funds that invest in one or more other hedge or private equity funds. Funds of funds are also called feeder funds because they feed assets from the original investor to a portfolio of funds. They are marketed as giving investors the capability to diversify across funds, as well as to provide the due diligence involved in screening funds for investment worthiness. In principle, this can be a valuable service because many alternative assets are opaque and feeder funds may have greater insight than typical outsiders.

However, when Bernard Madoff was arrested in December 2008 after admitting to a massive Ponzi scheme, many large feeder funds were found to be among his biggest clients, and their "due diligence" may have been, to put it mildly, lacking. At the head of the list was Fairfield Greenwich Advisors, with exposure reported at  \$7.5 billion, but several other feeder funds and asset management firms around the world were also on the hook for amounts greater than\$ 1 billion. In the end, it appears that some funds had, in effect, become little more than marketing agents for Madoff.

The option-like nature of compensation can have a big impact on expected fees in funds of funds. This is because the fund of funds pays an incentive fee to each underlying fund that outperforms its benchmark, even if the aggregate performance of the fund of funds is poor. Example 26.7 demonstrates that here diversification can hurt you!56

# Example 26.7 Incentive Fees in Funds of Funds

Suppose a fund of funds is established with 1 million invested in each of three hedge funds. For simplicity, we will ignore the asset-value-based portion of fees (the management fee) and focus only on the incentive fee. Suppose that the hurdle rate for the incentive fee is a zero return, so each fund charges an incentive fee of 20\% of total return. The following table shows the performance of each underlying fund over a year, the gross rate of return, and the return realized by the fund of funds net of the incentive fee. Funds 1 and 2 have positive returns, and therefore earn an incentive fee, but Fund 3 has terrible performance, so its incentive fee is zero.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Fund 1</td><td>Fund 2</td><td>Fund 3</td><td>Fund of Funds</td></tr><tr><td>Start of year (millions)</td><td>$1.00</td><td>$1.00</td><td>$1.00</td><td>$3.00</td></tr><tr><td>End of year (millions)</td><td>$1.20</td><td>$1.40</td><td>$0.25</td><td>$2.85</td></tr><tr><td>Gross rate of return</td><td>20\%</td><td>40\%</td><td>-75\%</td><td>-5\%</td></tr><tr><td>Incentive fee (millions)</td><td>$0.04</td><td>$0.08</td><td>$0.00</td><td>$0.12</td></tr><tr><td>End of year, net of fee</td><td>$1.16</td><td>$1.32</td><td>$0.25</td><td>$2.73</td></tr><tr><td>Net rate of return</td><td>16\%</td><td>32\%</td><td>-75\%</td><td>-9\%</td></tr></table>

Even though the return on the aggregate portfolio of the fund of funds is negative  $5\%$ , it still pays incentive fees of $.12 for every \$3 invested because incentive fees are paid on the first two well-performing funds. The incentive fees amount to  $4\%$  of net asset value. As demonstrated in the last column, this reduces the rate of return earned by the fund of funds from  $-5\%$  to  $-9\%$ .

# SUMMARY

1. Like traditional assets, alternative assets are governed by the laws of supply and demand as well as risk and expected return. However, alternative assets differ from traditional assets with respect to disclosure, investor base, flexibility and predictability of investment orientation, regulation, liquidity, investment horizon, and fee structure.
2. Hedge funds pool the assets of several clients and manage these assets on their clients' behalf. Directional hedge funds take a stance on the performance of broad market sectors. Nondirectional funds establish market-neutral positions on relative mispricing. Even these hedged positions still present idiosyncratic risk.
3. Statistical arbitrage uses quantitative systems to find potential misalignments in relative pricing. It ensures profits by averaging over many small bets.
4. Portable alpha is a strategy that invests in positive-alpha positions, hedges the systematic risk of those investments, and establishes market exposure where desired by using passive index products or futures contracts.
5. Venture capital is professionally managed money that invests in start-ups. Venture capital funds provide financing in exchange for ownership positions. This form of private equity actively tries to improve and grow the start-up with an eye toward an eventual IPO or acquisition.
6. Leveraged buyouts buy publicly traded companies, taking them private to improve their governance, operations, and financial structure. To amplify equity returns, LBOs use large amounts of debt to leverage their ownership and returns. Evidence suggests that both LBOs and VCs contribute to innovation.

7. Performance evaluation of alternative assets is complicated by the liquidity premia, reporting biases, and unreliable market valuations of infrequently traded assets. Performance evaluation is particularly difficult when a fund engages in option positions. Tail events make it hard to assess the true performance of positions without extremely long histories of returns.
8. Both hedge funds and private equity typically charge investors a management fee and an incentive fee equal to a percentage of profits beyond some threshold value, typically capital returned plus a hurdle rate. The incentive fee is akin to a call option on the portfolio.

8. A market-neutral fund (\$150,000,000) strives for very low market risk (β = .15). It believes it can generate α = .04 per quarter. The β of the underlying portfolio is 1.35. The risk-free rate is 0.5\% per quarter and the S&P 500 is currently priced at 4,000 (E-mini S&P 500 multiplier = \$50). If the S&P 500 is 3,800 at the end of quarter, what is the expected return on the portfolio?

9. Log in to Connect and link to Chapter 26 to find a spreadsheet containing monthly values of the S&P 500 index. Suppose that in each month you had written an out-of-the-money put option on one unit of the index with an exercise price  $5\%$  lower than the current value of the index.

a. What would have been the average value of your gross monthly payouts on the puts over the 10-year period October 1977–September 1987? The standard deviation?
b. Now extend your sample by 1 month to include October 1987 and recalculate the average payout and standard deviation of the put-writing strategy.
c. What do you conclude about tail risk in naked put writing?

10. Suppose a hedge fund follows the following strategy. Each month it holds \$100 million of an S&P 500 index fund and writes out-of-the-money put options on \$100 million of the index with exercise price 5\% lower than the current value of the index. Suppose the premium it receives for writing each put is $.25 million, roughly in line with the actual value of the puts.

a. Calculate the Sharpe ratio the fund would have realized in the period October 1982–September 1987. Compare its Sharpe ratio to that of the S&P 500. Use the data from the previous problem, available in Connect, and assume the monthly risk-free interest rate over this period was .7\%.
b. Now calculate the Sharpe ratio the fund would have realized if we extend the sample period by one month to include October 1987.
c. What do you conclude about performance evaluation and tail risk for funds pursuing option-like strategies?

11. The following is part of the computer output from a regression of monthly returns on Waterworks stock against the S&P 500 index. A hedge fund believes that Waterworks is underpriced, with an alpha of  $2\%$  over the coming month.

<table><tr><td>Beta</td><td>R-square</td><td>Standard Deviation of Residuals</td></tr><tr><td>0.75</td><td>0.65</td><td>0.06 (i.e., 6\% monthly)</td></tr></table> a. If the fund holds a \$4 million position in Waterworks stock and wishes to hedge market exposure for the next month using 1-month maturity S&P 500 futures contracts, how many contracts should it enter? Should it buy or sell contracts? The S&P 500 currently is at 4,000 and the contract multiplier is \$50.

$b$ . What is the standard deviation of the monthly return of the hedged portfolio?
c. Assuming that monthly returns are approximately normally distributed, what is the probability that this market-neutral strategy will lose money over the next month? Assume the risk-free rate is .5\% per month.
d. Suppose you hold an equally weighted portfolio of 100 stocks with the same alpha, beta, and residual standard deviation as Waterworks. Assume the residual returns (the  $e$  terms in Equations 26.1 and 26.2) on each of these stocks are independent of each other. What is the residual standard deviation of the portfolio?
e. Recalculate the probability of a loss on a market-neutral strategy involving equally weighted, market-hedged positions in the 100 stocks over the next month.

12. Return to Problem 11, parts  $(a) - (c)$ . Now suppose that the manager misestimates the beta of Waterworks stock, believing it to be .50 instead of .75. The standard deviation of the monthly market rate of return is  $5\%$ .

$a$ . What is the standard deviation of the (now improperly) hedged portfolio?
b. What is the probability of incurring a loss over the next month if the monthly market return has an expected value of  $1\%$  and a standard deviation of  $5\%$ ? Compare your answer to the probability you found in Problem 11.

c. What would be the probability of a loss using the data in Problem 11, parts  $(d)$  and  $(e)$ , if the manager similarly misestimated beta as .50 instead of .75? Compare your answer to the probability you found in Problem 11.
$d$ . Why does the misestimation of beta matter so much more for the 100-stock portfolio than it does for the 1-stock portfolio?

13. Here are data on three hedge funds. Each fund charges its investors an incentive fee of  $20\%$  of total returns. Suppose initially that a fund of funds (FF) manager buys equal amounts of each of these funds, also charging its investors a  $20\%$  incentive fee. For simplicity, assume also that management fees other than incentive fees are zero for all funds.

$a$ . Compute the rate of return after incentive fees to an investor in the fund of funds.
b. Suppose that instead of buying shares in each of the three hedge funds, a stand-alone (SA) hedge fund purchases the same portfolio as the three underlying funds. The total value and composition of the SA fund is therefore identical to the one that would result from aggregating the three hedge funds. Consider an investor in the SA fund. After paying  $20\%$  incentive fees, what would be the value of the investor's portfolio at the end of the year?
c. Confirm that the investor's rate of return in SA is higher than in FF by an amount equal to the extra layer of fees charged by the fund of funds.
$d$ . Now suppose that the return on the portfolio held by hedge fund 3 were  $-30\%$  rather than  $+30\%$ . Recalculate your answers to parts  $(a)$  and  $(b)$ .
$e$ . Will either FF or SA charge an incentive fee in the scenario of part  $(d)$ ?
$f$ . Why then does the investor in FF still do worse than the investor in SA?

You are willing to contribute \$1,500,000 in the A round of financing and require a capital return (i.e., capital multiplier) of 12. You anticipate B and C rounds of financing in years 3 and 6 that will dilute your position by 30\% and 40\%, respectively, because your firm will not participate in either additional round.

17. You manage a multi-stage VC fund conducting due diligence on an pharmaceutical start-up. The required rate of return is  $33\%$ . You will participate in an A round initially, a B round in four years, and a C round in seven years.

a. In the A round, what equity position do you need to justify a \$1,000,000 investment if the pre-round valuation of the firm is \$2,500,000?
b. In the B round, an additional 4,500,000 will be raised from a syndication of VCs including your firm. To maintain your equity position, how much must you contribute to the B round of financing? Assume the firm is valued at cost.
c. In the C round, an additional 10,000,000 will be raised from the same syndication of VCs. If you wish to continue to maintain the same equity position, how much will you need to invest in this round? Assume the firm continues to be valued at cost.

c. What would be the minimum necessary voting rights for the founders to maintain control through both rounds of financing? (Control is defined as greater than  $50\%$  ownership, with percentages rounded to whole numbers.)

21. The RRK buyout fund is considering an investment in a fertilizer distribution center. The stock currently trades at  \$20 per share with 150,000,000 shares outstanding. RRK offers\$ 25 per share, 80\% of which is funded by high-yield debt securities. The fund believes it can work with management to grow the firm at a rate of about 4\% while also retiring half of the high-yield debt by an expected exit in year 6, reinvesting any profit in growth and debt reduction. What is the expected IRR of this investment?

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. a. Nondirectional. The shares in the fund and the short position in the index swap constitute a hedged position. The hedge fund is betting that the discount on the closed-end fund will shrink and that it will profit regardless of the general movements in the Indian market.
b. Nondirectional. The values of both ExxonMobil and Chevron are largely driven by oil industry prospects, so this is a bet on relative performance.
c. Directional. This is an outright bet on the price that Generic Pharmaceuticals will eventually command at the conclusion of the predicted takeover attempt.
2. The expected rate of return on the hedged position (in the absence of any knowledge about idiosyncratic returns reflected in the residual) is  $3\%$ . If the residual turns out to be  $-4\%$ , then the position will lose  $1\%$  of its value over the month and fall to 2.475 million.
3. a.  $w_{\text{Terminal}} = \frac{v_{\text{Initial}} \times \text{Capital multiplier}}{v_{\text{Terminal}}} = \frac{\$2,000,000 \times 10}{\$90,000,000} = .2222$ , or  $22.22\%$

$$ w _ {\text {Intermediate}} = \frac {w _ {\text {Terminal}}}{1 - \text {Second Dilution}} = \frac {.2222}{1 - 0.25} = .2963, \text {or} 29.63 \%
$$

$$ w _ {\text {Initial}} = \frac {w _ {\text {Intermediate}}}{1 - \text {First Dilution}} = \frac {.2963}{1 - 0.25} = .3951, \text {or} 39.51 \%
$$

$b$ . If the VC commits to investing sufficient capital to maintain its initial ownership level, then the initial position can be set equal to the terminal ownership level  $(22.22\%)$ .

4. Debt is used to amplify the return of the LBO's position. For the all-equity position, the initial investment of \$25 million grows to \$48 million after 5 years, so we solve for the IRR as follows:

$$
\$ 25,000,000 = \frac{\$ 48,000,000}{(1 + \mathrm{IRR})^{5}}\text{, which implies that IRR is} 13.94\%
$$

At an initial debt-to-equity ratio of 1, the firm raises half the acquisition fee by contributing its own capital and raises the other half by borrowing. Therefore, its initial contribution is only  \$12.5 million, and its final payout is\$ 48 million – \$12.5 million = \$35.5 million. IRR increases to 23.22\%, found as follows:

$$
\$ 12,500,000 = \frac{\$ 35,500,000}{(1 + \mathrm{IRR})^{5}}\rightarrow \mathrm{IRR} = 23.22\%
$$

At 20\% equity/80\% debt, the initial equity investment is only 20\% of \$25 million, or \$5 million, leaving \$20 million of debt to be raised. Therefore, the final payout is \$48 million – \$20 million = \$28 million. IRR vaults to 41.14\%, demonstrating the power of leverage.

$$
\$ 5,000,000 = \frac{\$ 28,000,000}{(1 + \mathrm{IRR})^{5}}\rightarrow \mathrm{IRR} = 41.14\%
$$

5. Fixed-income arbitrage portfolios show positive exposure to the long bond and to the credit spread. This pattern suggests that these are not hedged arbitrage portfolios, but in fact are directional portfolios.

# The Theory of Active Portfolio Management

# 27

THIS CHAPTER CONSIDERS practical complexities in the process of constructing optimal portfolios. We've already devoted considerable attention to the principles of portfolio construction, particularly in Chapters 7 and 8. But the execution of these portfolio models presents several problems in implementation. Chief among them is the input list of expected returns (or, almost equivalently, of security alphas) and covariances. Expected returns are especially difficult to estimate from historical data. Security alphas are highly inconsistent from one period to the next. Moreover, as we will see, portfolio weights are exceedingly sensitive to assumed values of alpha. Even apparently reasonable forecasts of alpha can result in optimal risky portfolios calling for extreme long positions or, alternatively (if alpha is negative), short positions in several component securities. These portfolios will be deemed unacceptable by most traders.

Therefore, we need additional guidance as to how to put our models to work in a more realistic setting. Fortunately, theory can provide guidance even for these practical problems. We begin with the Treynor-Black model that we first encountered in Chapter 8, now showing how to handle limited precision in the forecasts of alpha values and the extreme portfolio positions often prescribed by the model. Armed with these insights, we present a prototype organizational chart and discuss the efficacy of adapting the organization to the theoretical underpinning of portfolio management.

In the next section, we present the Black-Litterman model, which allows flexible views about the expected returns of major asset classes to improve asset allocation. Then we look into the potential value of security analysis and end with concluding remarks. An appendix to the chapter presents the mathematics underlying the Black-Litterman model.

# 27.1 Optimal Portfolios and Alpha Values

In Chapter 8, we showed how to form an optimal risky portfolio with a single-index model. Table 27.1 summarizes the steps in this optimization, commonly known as the Treynor-Black model. This procedure uses the index model that ignores potential correlation of residual returns.

Table 27.1

Construction and properties of the optimal risky portfolio

1. Initial position of security  $i$  in the active portfolio
2. Scaled initial positions

$$ w _ {i} ^ {0} = \frac {\alpha_ {i}}{\sigma^ {2} (e _ {i})}
$$

3. Alpha of the active portfolio

$$ w _ {i} = \frac {w _ {i} ^ {0}}{\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \frac {\alpha_ {i}}{\sigma^ {2} (e _ {i})}}
$$

4. Residual variance of the active portfolio

$$
\alpha_ {A} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} W _ {i} \alpha_ {i}
$$

5. Initial position in the active portfolio

$$
\pmb {\sigma} ^ {2} (\pmb {e} _ {A}) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} w _ {i} ^ {2} \pmb {\sigma} ^ {2} (\pmb {e} _ {i})
$$

6. Beta of the active portfolio

$$ w _ {A} ^ {0} = \frac {\frac {\alpha_ {A}}{\sigma^ {2} (e _ {A})}}{\frac {E (R _ {M})}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}}}
$$

7. Adjusted (for beta) position in the active portfolio

$$
\beta_ {A} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} w _ {i} \beta_ {i}
$$

8. Final weights in passive portfolio and in security  $i$

$$ w _ {A} ^ {*} = \frac {w _ {A} ^ {0}}{1 + (1 - \beta_ {A}) w _ {A} ^ {0}}
$$

9. The beta of the optimal risky portfolio and its risk premium

$$ w _ {M} ^ {*} = 1 - w _ {A} ^ {*}; \qquad w _ {i} ^ {*} = w _ {A} ^ {*} w _ {i}
$$

10. The variance of the optimal risky portfolio

$$
\beta_ {P} = W _ {M} ^ {*} + W _ {A} ^ {*} \beta_ {A} = 1 - W _ {A} ^ {*} (1 - \beta_ {A})
$$

11. Sharpe ratio of the risky portfolio

$$
E (R _ {P}) = \beta_ {P} E (R _ {M}) + w _ {A} ^ {*} \alpha_ {A}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \beta_ {P} ^ {2} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} + [ w _ {A} ^ {*} \overline {{\sigma}} (e _ {A}) ] ^ {2}
$$

$$
S _ {P} ^ {2} = S _ {M} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \left(\frac {\alpha_ {i}}{\sigma (e _ {i})}\right) ^ {2}
$$

For illustration, Spreadsheet 27.1 summarizes the input data we use in this exercise as well as the resulting optimal portfolio. Panel D shows the resulting optimal risky portfolio and the improvement in the Sharpe ratio over the passive market-index portfolio offered by adding the active portfolio to the mix. To better appreciate this improvement, we have included the  $M$ -square measure of performance.  $M$ -square is the incremental expected return of the optimized portfolio compared to the passive alternative once the active portfolio is mixed with bills to provide the same total volatility as the index portfolio (for a review, see Chapter 24).

# Forecasts of Alpha Values and Extreme Portfolio Weights

The overriding impression from Spreadsheet 27.1 is the apparently meager improvement in performance: Panel D shows that  $M$ -square increases by only 19 basis points (equivalent to an improvement of .0136 in the Sharpe ratio). Notice that the Sharpe ratio of the active portfolio is inferior to that of the passive portfolio (due to its large standard deviation), and hence its  $M$ -square is actually negative. But because the active portfolio is mixed with the passive portfolio, total volatility is not the appropriate measure of risk. When combined

with the passive portfolio, it does offer some improvement in performance, albeit quite modest. This is the best that can be had given the alpha values uncovered by the security analysts (see Panel C). Notice that the position in the active portfolio amounts to  $17\%$  (cell C43), financed in part by a combined short position in Dell and Walmart of about  $10\%$ . Because the figures in Spreadsheet 27.1 are annualized, this performance is equivalent to a 1-year holding-period return (HPR).

The alpha values we use in Spreadsheet 27.1 are quite modest by the standard of typical analysts' forecasts. Alphas inferred from 1-year-ahead "target" (i.e., forecasted) prices of security analysts are commonly far larger than the values in Panel C. To see how sensitive the optimal risky portfolio can be to assumed alpha, we recompute its composition in

Table 27.2, but with a new set of assumed values of alpha (in the top row of the table) that are more representative of the magnitudes that one might encounter in practice.

Table 27.2 shows the optimal portfolio using these forecasts rather than the original alpha values shown in Panel C in Spreadsheet 27.1. The difference in performance is striking. The Sharpe ratio of the new optimal portfolio has increased from the benchmark's .44 to 2.32, amounting to a huge risk-adjusted return advantage. This shows up in an  $M$ -square of  $25.53\%$

However, these results also expose a potential major problem with the Treynor-Black model. The optimal portfolio now calls for extreme long/short positions that may be infeasible for a real-world portfolio manager. For example, the model calls for a position of 5.79 (579\%) in the active portfolio (see the bottom row of the top panel), largely financed by a short position of  $-4.79$  in the S&P 500 index. Moreover, the standard deviation of this optimal portfolio is  $52.24\%$ , a level of risk that only extremely aggressive hedge funds would be willing to bear. It is important to notice that this risk is largely nonsystematic because the beta of the active portfolio, at .95, is less than 1.0, and the beta of the overall risky portfolio is even lower, only .73, because of the short position in the passive portfolio. Only hedge funds may be interested in this portfolio.

One approach to this problem is to restrict extreme portfolio positions, beginning with short sales. We can rule out short positions in the passive index portfolio (in this example, the S&P 500) by requiring that the weight in the active portfolio cannot exceed  $100\%$ . Imposing this constraint, the active portfolio now comprises the entire risky position and the weight of the S&P 500 is zero. Table 27.3 shows that the optimal portfolio now has a standard deviation of  $15.68\%$ , not overwhelmingly greater than the SD of the passive portfolio  $(13.58\%)$ . The beta of the overall risky portfolio is now that of the active portfolio (.95). Despite this severe restriction, the optimization procedure is still powerful, and the  $M$ -square of the optimal risky portfolio (now the active portfolio) is a very large  $16.42\%$ .

Is this a satisfactory solution? This would depend on the organization. For hedge funds, this may be a dream portfolio (assuming, of course, that the alpha estimates are accurate). For most mutual funds, however, the lack of diversification would rule it out. Notice the positions in the six stocks: Walmart, Target, and British Petroleum alone account for  $76\%$  of the portfolio.

Here we have to acknowledge the limitations of our example. Surely, you may be thinking, when the investment company covers more securities, the problem of lack of diversification will largely vanish. But it turns out that the problem with extreme long/short positions typically persists even when we consider a larger number of firms, and this can gut the practical value of the optimization model. Consider this conclusion from an important article by Black and Litterman:

[T]he mean-variance optimization used in standard asset allocation models is extremely sensitive to expected return assumptions the investor must provide. . . . The optimal portfolio, given its sensitivity to the expected returns, often appears to bear little or no relation to the views the investor wishes to express. In practice, therefore, despite obvious conceptual attractions of a quantitative approach, few global investment managers regularly allow quantitative models to play a major role in their asset allocation decisions.

Clearly, the Markowitz mean-variance portfolio selection model (and the Treynor-Black model, which is just a special case of the Markowitz model) must be modified before it can be put into practical use. One approach that has garnered considerable attention is

Table 27.3

The optimal risky portfolio with constraint on the active portfolio  $(w_{A} \leq 1)$ the Black-Litterman model, which we will address in Section 27.3. But even the Treynor-Black model can be made far more palatable to practitioners with some straightforward modifications.


# Restriction of Tracking Risk

Black and Litterman point out a related important practical issue. Most investment managers are judged not on their absolute performance, but on performance compared to that of a benchmark portfolio. This practice raises the importance of tracking error. Tracking error is estimated from the time series of differences between the returns on the overall risky portfolio and the benchmark return, that is,  $T_{E} = R_{P} - R_{M}$ . The portfolio manager must be mindful of tracking risk, which we measure as the standard deviation of the tracking error.

The tracking error of the optimized risky portfolio can be expressed in terms of the beta of the portfolio and thus reveals the tracking risk:

Tracking error  $= T_{E} = R_{P} - R_{M}$

$$
R _ {P} = w _ {A} ^ {*} \alpha_ {A} + \left[ 1 - w _ {A} ^ {*} (1 - \beta_ {A}) \right] R _ {M} + w _ {A} ^ {*} e _ {A}
$$

$$
T _ {E} = w _ {A} ^ {*} \alpha_ {A} - w _ {A} ^ {*} (1 - \beta_ {A}) R _ {M} + w _ {A} ^ {*} e _ {A} \tag {27.1}
$$

$$
\operatorname {V a r} \left(T _ {E}\right) = \left[ w _ {A} ^ {*} \left(1 - \beta_ {A}\right) \right] ^ {2} \operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {M}\right) + \operatorname {V a r} \left(w _ {A} ^ {*} e _ {A}\right) = \left[ w _ {A} ^ {*} \left(1 - \beta_ {A}\right) \right] ^ {2} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} + \left[ w _ {A} ^ {*} \sigma \left(e _ {A}\right) \right] ^ {2}
$$

Tracking risk  $= \sigma (T_{E}) = w_{A}^{*}\sqrt{(1 - \beta_{A})^{2}\sigma_{M}^{2} + [\sigma(e_{A})]^{2}}$

Equation 27.1 shows us how to calculate the volatility of tracking error and how to set the position in the active portfolio,  $w_{A}^{*}$ , to restrict tracking risk to any desired level. For a unit investment in the active portfolio, that is, for  $w_{A}^{*} = 1$ , tracking risk is

$$
\sigma \left(T _ {E}; w _ {A} ^ {*} = 1\right) = \sqrt {\left(1 - \beta_ {A}\right) ^ {2} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} + \left[ \sigma \left(e _ {A}\right) \right] ^ {2}} \tag {27.2}
$$

To limit tracking risk to a value of  $\sigma_0(T_E)$ , we would restrict the weight of the active portfolio to

$$ w _ {A} \left(T _ {E}\right) = \frac {\sigma_ {0} \left(T _ {E}\right)}{\sigma \left(T _ {E} ; w _ {A} ^ {*} = 1\right)} \tag {27.3}
$$

Introducing a constraint on tracking risk necessarily entails a cost. To limit tracking error, we shift weight from the active to the passive portfolio. Figure 27.1 illustrates the cost of this response. Ignoring tracking error, the portfolio optimization would lead us to portfolio  $T$ , the tangency of the capital allocation line (CAL), which is the ray from the risk-free rate to the efficient frontier formed from  $A$  and  $M$ . Reducing tracking risk by shifting weight from  $T$  to  $M$  takes us down the efficient frontier, instead of along the CAL, to a lower risk position, reducing the Sharpe ratio and  $M$ -square of the constrained portfolio.

Notice that the standard deviation of tracking error using the "meager" alpha forecasts in Spreadsheet 27.1 is only  $3.46\%$  because the weight in the active portfolio is only  $17\%$ . Using the larger alphas of Table 27.3 with no restriction on portfolio weights, the standard deviation of tracking error is  $51.46\%$ , more than any real-life manager who is evaluated against a benchmark would be willing to bear. However, with a weight of 1.0 on the active portfolio, tracking risk falls to  $8.87\%$  (Table 27.3).

Finally, suppose a manager wishes to restrict tracking risk to the same level as it was using the original forecasts, that is, to  $3.46\%$ . Equations 27.2 and 27.3 instruct us to invest  $w_{A} = .43$  in the active portfolio. We would then obtain the results in Table 27.4. This portfolio is moderate, yet superior in performance: (1) its standard deviation is only slightly higher than that of the passive portfolio,  $13.85\%$ ; (2) its beta is .98; (3) the standard deviation of tracking error that we specified is extremely low,  $3.85\%$ ; (4) given that we have only six securities, the largest position of  $12\%$  (in Target, TGT) is quite low and would be lower still if more securities were covered; yet (5) the Sharpe ratio is a whopping 1.06, and the  $M$ -square is an impressive  $8.35\%$ . Thus, by imposing limits on tracking risk, we can avoid the flaws of the unconstrained portfolio and still maintain superior performance.

Table 27.4

The optimal risky portfolio with the analysts' new forecasts (tracking risk constrained to  $3.85\%$ )

# 27.2 The Treynor-Black Model and Forecast Precision

Suppose the risky portfolio of your  $401(\mathrm{k})$  retirement fund is currently in an S&P 500 index fund, and you are pondering whether you should take some extra risk and allocate some funds to Target's stock. You know that, absent research analysis, you should assume the alpha of any stock is zero. Hence, the mean of your prior distribution of Target's alpha is zero. Downloading return data for Target and the S&P 500 reveals a residual standard deviation of  $19.8\%$ . Given this volatility, the prior mean of zero, and an assumption of normality, you now have the entire prior distribution of Target's alpha.

One can make a decision using a prior distribution, or refine that distribution by expending effort to obtain additional data. In statistical jargon, this effort is called the experiment. The experiment as a stand-alone venture would yield a probability distribution of possible outcomes. The optimal statistical procedure is to combine one's prior distribution for alpha with the information derived from the experiment to form a posterior distribution that reflects both. This posterior distribution is then used for decision making.

A "tight" prior, that is, a distribution with a small standard deviation, implies a high degree of confidence in the likely range of possible alpha values even before looking at the data. In this case, the experiment may not be sufficiently convincing to affect your beliefs, meaning that the posterior will be little changed from the prior. In the context of the present discussion, constructing an estimate of alpha and its precision is the experiment that may induce you to update your prior beliefs about its value. The role of the portfolio manager is to form a posterior distribution of alpha that aids portfolio construction.

# Adjusting Forecasts for the Precision of Alpha

Imagine that you have just compiled the forecasts we used in Table 27.2, implying that Target's alpha is  $28.1\%$ . Should you conclude that the optimal position in Target, before adjusting for beta, is  $\alpha / \sigma^2(e) = .281 / .198^2 = 7.17$  ( $717\%$ )? Naturally, before committing to such an extreme position, any reasonable manager would first ask: "How accurate is this forecast?" and "How should I adjust my position to take account of forecast imprecision?"

Treynor and Black asked this question and supplied an answer. The logic of the answer is quite straightforward; you must quantify the uncertainty about this forecast, just as you would the risk of the underlying asset or portfolio. A Web surfer may not have a way to assess the precision of a downloaded forecast, but the employer of the analyst who issued the forecast does. How? By examining the forecasting record of previous forecasts issued by the same forecaster.

Suppose that a security analyst provides the portfolio manager with forecasts of alpha at regular intervals, say, the beginning of each month. The portfolio is updated using the forecast and held until the update of next month's forecast. At the end of each month,  $T$ , the realized abnormal return of Target's stock, is the sum of alpha plus an error term, or "residual":

$$ u (T) = R _ {\mathrm {T G T}} (T) - \beta_ {\mathrm {T G T}} R _ {M} (T) = \alpha (T) + e (T) \tag {27.4}
$$ where beta is estimated from Target's security characteristic line (SCL) using data for periods prior to  $T$ ,


$$
\text {S C L}: \quad R _ {\mathrm {T G T}} (t) = \alpha + \beta_ {\mathrm {T G T}} R _ {M} (t) + e (t), \quad t <   T \tag {27.5}
$$

The 1-month, forward-looking forecast  $\alpha^f (T)$  issued by the analyst at the beginning of month  $T$  is aimed at the abnormal return,  $u(T)$ , in Equation 27.4. In order to decide how much credence to place in the forecast for month  $T$ , the portfolio manager uses the analyst's forecasting record. The analyst's record comprises all past forecasts,  $\alpha^f (t)$ , paired with the realizations,  $u(t)$ . To assess forecast accuracy, that is, the relationship between forecast and realized alphas, the manager uses this record to estimate the regression:

$$ u (t) = a _ {0} + a _ {1} \alpha^ {f} (t) + \varepsilon (t) \tag {27.6}
$$

Our goal is to adjust alpha forecasts to properly account for their imprecision. We form an adjusted alpha forecast  $\alpha (T)$  for the coming month by using the original forecasts  $\alpha^f (T)$  and applying the estimates from the regression Equation 27.6, that is,

$$
\alpha (T) = a _ {0} + a _ {1} \alpha^ {f} (T) \tag {27.7}
$$

The properties of the regression estimates assure us that the adjusted forecast is the "best linear unbiased estimator" of the abnormal return on Target in the coming month,  $T$ . "Best" in this context means it has the lowest possible variance among unbiased forecasts that are linear functions of the original forecast. We show in Appendix A that the value we should use for  $a_1$  in Equation 27.7 is the  $R$ -square of the regression Equation 27.6. Because  $R$ -square is necessarily less than 1, this implies that we "shrink" the forecast toward zero. The lower the precision of the original forecast (the lower its  $R$ -square), the more we shrink the adjusted alpha back toward zero. In other words, we pay less attention to noisier forecasts. The coefficient  $a_0$  adjusts the forecast upward if the forecaster has been consistently pessimistic, and downward for consistent optimism.

# Distribution of Alpha Values

Equation 27.7 implies that the quality of security analysts' forecasts, as measured by the  $R$ -square in regressions of realized abnormal returns on their forecasts, is a critical issue for construction of optimal portfolios and resultant performance. Unfortunately, these numbers are usually impossible to come by.

One exception is Kane, Kim, and White, who obtained a unique database of analysts' forecasts from an investment company specializing in large stocks with the S&P 500 used as the benchmark portfolio. Their database includes a set of 37 monthly pairs of forecasts of alpha and beta values for between 646 and 771 stocks over the period December 1992 to December 1995—in all, 23,902 forecasts. The investment company policy was to truncate alpha forecasts at  $+14\%$  and  $-12\%$  per month. The histogram of these forecasts is shown in Figure 27.2.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/75c00cfcc2b8476da6c31e6f001b24eadab3abf4edc985c44558615bfabfd352.jpg)
Figure 27.2 Histogram of alpha forecast

Returns of large stocks over these years were about average, as shown in the following table, including one average year (1993), one bad year (1994), and one good year (1995):

<table><tr><td></td><td>1993</td><td>1994</td><td>1995</td><td>1926–1999
Average</td><td>SD (\%)</td></tr><tr><td>Rate of return (\%)</td><td>9.87</td><td>1.29</td><td>37.71</td><td>12.50</td><td>20.39</td></tr></table>

The histogram shows that the distribution of alpha forecasts was positively skewed, with a larger number of pessimistic forecasts. The adjusted  $R$ -square in a regression of these forecasts with actual alphas was .001134, implying a tiny correlation coefficient of .0337.

These results contain "good" and "bad" news. The good news is that after adjusting even the wildest forecast, say, an alpha of  $12\%$  for the next month, the value to be used by a forecaster when  $R$ -square is .001 would be  $0.12\%$ , just 1.2 basis points per month. On an annual basis, this would amount to  $0.14\%$ , which is of the order of the alpha forecasts of the example in Spreadsheet 27.1. With forecasts of this small magnitude, the problem of extreme portfolio weights would never arise. The bad news arises from the same data: The performance of the active portfolio will be no better than in our example—implying an  $M$ -square of only 19 basis points.

However, this limited performance is based on an active portfolio that includes only six stocks. As we show in Section 27.5, even small information ratios of individual stocks can add up (see line 11 in Table 27.1). Thus, when many forecasts of even low precision are used to form a large active portfolio, large profits can be made.

# Organizational Structure and Performance

The mathematical properties of the optimal risky portfolio reveal a central feature of investment companies, namely, economies of scale. From the Sharpe measure of the optimized portfolio shown in Table 27.1, it is evident that performance as measured by the Sharpe ratio and  $M$ -square grows steadily with the squared information ratio of the active portfolio (see Chapter 8, Equation 8.26, for a review), which in turn is the sum of the squared information ratios of the covered securities (see Equation 8.28). Hence, a larger force of security analysts is sure to improve portfolio performance. Moreover, a larger universe will also improve the diversification of the active portfolio and mitigate the need to hold positions in the neutral passive portfolio. Finally, as we will show in some detail in Section 27.5, increasing the universe of securities creates another diversification effect, that of forecasting errors by analysts.

Increases in the universe of the active portfolio in pursuit of better performance come at a cost because security analysts of quality do not come cheap. However, the other units of the organization can handle increased activity with little increase in cost. All this suggests economies of scale for larger investment companies provided the organizational structure is efficient.

Optimizing the risky portfolio entails a number of tasks of different nature in terms of expertise and need for independence. As a result, the organizational chart of the portfolio management outfit requires a degree of decentralization and proper controls. Figure 27.3 shows an organizational chart designed to achieve these goals. The figure is largely self-explanatory and the structure is consistent with the theoretical considerations worked out in previous chapters. It can go a long way in forging sound underpinnings to the daily work of portfolio management. A few comments are in order, though.

The control units responsible for forecasting records and determining forecast adjustments will directly affect the advancement and bonuses of security analysts and estimation experts. This implies that these units must be independent and insulated from organizational pressures.

An important issue is the conflict between independence of security analysts' opinions versus the need for cooperation and coordination in the use of resources as well as contacts with corporate and government overseers. In contrast, the macro forecast unit might become too insulated from the security analysis unit. An effort to create an interface and channels of communications between these units is warranted.

# 27.3 The Black-Litterman Model

Fischer Black, famous for the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula as well as the Treynor-Black model, teamed up with Robert Litterman to produce another useful model of portfolio construction. The Black-Litterman (BL) model allows portfolio managers to quantify complex forecasts (which they call views) and apply these views to portfolio construction. We begin the discussion of the BL model with an illustration of a simple problem of asset allocation. Although we devote the next section to a comparison of the two models, some comments on commonalities of the models will help us better understand the BL model.

# Black-Litterman Asset Allocation Decision

Consider a portfolio manager laboring over asset allocation to bills, bonds, and stocks for the next month. The risky portfolio will be constructed from bonds and stocks so as to maximize the Sharpe ratio. So far this is no more than the problem described in Section 7.3 of Chapter 7. There, we were concerned with optimizing the portfolio given a set of data inputs. In real life, however, optimization using a given dataset is the least of the manager's problems. The real challenge is how to come by the necessary input data. Black and Litterman propose an approach that uses past data, equilibrium considerations, and the private views of the portfolio manager about the near future.

Data enter the BL model from two sources: history and forecasts, called views, about the future. The historical sample is used to estimate the covariance matrix of the asset classes involved in the asset allocation decision. The estimated covariance matrix, combined with a model of equilibrium returns (e.g., the CAPM), is used to produce baseline forecasts that would be the basis of a passive strategy. In the next step, views are introduced and quantified. The views represent a departure from the baseline forecast and result in a revised set of expected returns. With the new set of inputs (just as with alpha forecasts in the Treynor-Black model), an optimal risky portfolio is designed to replace the (no-longer-efficient) passive portfolio.

# Step 1: The Covariance Matrix from Historical Data

This straightforward task is the first in the chain that makes up the BL model. Suppose step 1 results in the following annualized covariance matrix, estimated from recent historical excess returns:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Bonds (B)</td><td></td><td>Stocks (S)</td></tr><tr><td>Standard deviation</td><td>0.08</td><td></td><td>0.17</td></tr><tr><td>Correlation (bonds/stocks)</td><td></td><td>0.3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Covariance</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Bonds</td><td>0.0064</td><td></td><td>0.00408</td></tr><tr><td>Stocks</td><td>0.00408</td><td></td><td>0.0289</td></tr></table>

Notice that step 1 is common to both the BL and the Treynor-Black (TB) models. This activity appears in the organizational chart in Figure 27.3.

# Step 2: Determination of a Baseline Forecast

Because past data are of such limited use in inferring expected returns for the next month, BL propose an alternative approach. They start with a baseline forecast derived from the assumption that the market is in equilibrium, with current prices of stocks and bonds reflecting all available information. As a result, the theoretical market portfolio with weights equal to market-value proportions is efficient. Suppose that current market values of outstanding bonds and stocks imply that the weight of bonds in the baseline portfolio is  $w_{B} = .25$ , and the weight of stocks is  $w_{S} = .75$ . When we apply these portfolio weights to the covariance matrix from step 1, the variance of the baseline portfolio emerges as

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {M}\right) = w _ {B} ^ {2} \operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {B}\right) + w _ {S} ^ {2} \operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {S}\right) + 2 w _ {B} w _ {S} \operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {B}, R _ {S}\right) \\ = . 2 5 ^ {2} \times . 0 0 6 4 +. 7 5 ^ {2} \times . 0 2 8 9 + 2 \times . 2 5 \times . 7 5 \times . 0 0 4 0 8 = . 0 1 8 1 8 6 \tag {27.8} \\ \end{array}
$$

The CAPM equation (Equation 9.2 in Chapter 9) gives the relationship between the market portfolio risk (variance) and its risk premium (expected excess return) as

$$
E \left(R _ {M}\right) = \bar {A} \times \operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {M}\right) \tag {27.9}
$$ where  $\overline{A}$  is the average coefficient of risk aversion. Assuming  $\overline{A} = 3$  yields the equilibrium risk premium of the baseline portfolio as  $E(R_M) = 3 \times .018186 = .0546 = 5.46\%$ . The equilibrium risk premiums on bonds and stocks can be inferred from their betas on the baseline portfolio:


$$
E \left(R _ {B}\right) = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {B} , R _ {M}\right)}{\operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {M}\right)} E \left(R _ {M}\right)
$$

$$
\operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {B}, R _ {M}\right) = \operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {B}, w _ {B} R _ {B} + w _ {S} R _ {S}\right) = . 2 5 \times . 0 0 6 4 +. 7 5 \times . 0 0 4 0 8 = . 0 0 4 6 6
$$

$$
E \left(R _ {B}\right) = \frac {.00466}{.018186} \times 5.46 \% = 1.40 \% (\text {bond beta} = .26) \tag{27.10}
$$

$$
E \left(R _ {S}\right) = \frac {. 75 \times . 0289 + . 25 \times . 00408}{. 018186} \times 5.46 \% = 6.81 \% (\text {stock beta} = 1.25)
$$

Thus, step 2 ends up with baseline forecasts of a risk premium for bonds of  $1.40\%$  and for stocks of  $6.81\%$ .

The final element in step 2 is to determine the covariance matrix of the baseline forecasts. This is a statement about the precision of these forecasts, which is different from the covariance matrix of realized excess returns on the bond and stock portfolios. We are looking for the precision of the estimate of expected return, as opposed to the volatility of actual returns. A rule of thumb in this application is to use a standard deviation that is  $10\%$  of the standard deviation of returns (or, equivalently, a variance that is  $1\%$  of the return variance). To illustrate, imagine that the covariance matrix of actual return was estimated from the returns of the last 100 months. The variance of the average return (which is the forecast of the expected return) would then be  $1\%$  of the variance of the actual return. Hence, in this case, one would use .01 times the covariance matrix of returns for the expected return. Thus, step 2 ends with a forecast and covariance matrix:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Bonds (B)</td><td>Stocks (S)</td></tr><tr><td>Expected return (\%)</td><td>0.0140</td><td>0.0681</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Covariance matrix of baseline forecasts</td></tr><tr><td>Bonds</td><td>0.000064</td><td>0.0000408</td></tr><tr><td>Stocks</td><td>0.0000408</td><td>0.000289</td></tr></table>

Now that we have backed out market expectations, it is time to integrate the manager's private views into our analysis.

# Step 3: Integrating the Manager's Private Views

The BL model allows the manager to introduce any number of views about the baseline forecasts into the optimization process. Appended to the views, the manager's degree of confidence in them must be specified. Views in the BL model are expressed as values of various linear combinations of excess returns, and confidence in them is expressed as a covariance matrix of errors in these values.

# Example 27.1 Views in the Black-Litterman Model

Suppose the manager takes a contrarian's view concerning the baseline forecasts, that is, he believes that in the next month bonds will outperform stocks by  $.5\%$ . The following equation expresses this view:

$$
1 \times R _ {B} + (- 1) \times R _ {S} = . 5
$$

More generally, any view that is a linear combination of the relevant excess returns can be presented as an array (in Excel, an array would be a column of numbers) that multiplies another array (column) of excess returns. In this case, the array of weights is  $P = (1, -1)$  and the array of excess returns is  $(R_{B}, R_{S})$ . The value of this linear combination, denoted  $Q$ , reflects the manager's view. In this case,  $Q = .5\%$  must be taken into account in optimizing the portfolio.

A view must come with a degree of confidence, that is, a standard deviation to measure the precision of  $Q$ . The manager's view is really  $Q + \varepsilon$ , where  $\varepsilon$  represents zero-mean error in the view with a standard deviation that reflects the manager's less-than-perfect confidence. Noticing that the standard deviation of the difference between the expected rates on stocks and bonds is  $1.65\%$  (calculated in Equation 27.13), suppose that the manager assigns a value of  $\sigma(\varepsilon) = 1.73\%$ . To summarize, if we denote the array of returns by  $R = (R_{B}, R_{S})$ , then the manager's view,  $P$ , applied to these returns is

$$
P R ^ {T} = Q + \varepsilon
$$

$$
P = (1, - 1)
$$

$$
R = \left(R _ {B}, R _ {S}\right) \tag {27.11}
$$

$$
Q = .5\% = .005
$$

$$
\sigma^ {2} (\varepsilon) = . 0 1 7 3 ^ {2} = . 0 0 0 3
$$

# Step 4: Revised (Posterior) Expectations

The baseline forecasts of expected returns derived from market values and their covariance matrix comprise the prior distribution of the rates of return on bonds and stocks.

The manager's view, together with its confidence measure, provides the probability distribution arising from the "experiment," that is, the additional information that must be optimally integrated with the prior distribution. The result is the posterior: a new set of expected returns, conditioned on the manager's views.

To acquire intuition about the solution, consider what the baseline expected returns imply about the view. The expectations derived from market data are that the expected return on bonds is  $1.40\%$  and the expected return on stocks is  $6.81\%$ . Therefore, the baseline view is that  $E(R_{B}) - E(R_{S}) = -5.41\%$ . In contrast, the manager thinks this difference is  $Q = R_{B} - R_{S} = .5\%$ . Using the BL linear-equation notation for market expectations:

$$
Q ^ {E} = P R _ {E} ^ {T}
$$

$$
P = (1, - 1) \tag {27.12}
$$

$$
R _ {E} = \left[ E \left(R _ {B}\right), E \left(R _ {S}\right) \right] = (1.40 \%, 6.81 \%)
$$

$$
Q ^ {E} = 1.40 - 6.81 = - 5.41 \%
$$

The baseline "view" of  $-5.41\%$  (i.e., that stocks will outperform bonds by  $5.41\%$ ) is vastly different from the manager's view. The difference,  $D$ , and its variance are

$$
D = Q - Q ^ {E} = . 0 0 5 - (-. 0 5 4 1) = . 0 5 9 1 \tag {27.13}
$$

Therefore, the variance of  $D$  equals:

$$
\sigma^ {2} (D) = \sigma^ {2} (\varepsilon) + \sigma^ {2} (Q ^ {E}) = . 0 0 0 3 + \sigma^ {2} (Q ^ {E})
$$

Next, we solve for the variance of  $Q^{E}$  and substitute back into our expression for the variance of  $D$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma^ {2} (Q ^ {E}) = \operatorname {V a r} \left[ E \left(R _ {B}\right) - E \left(R _ {S}\right) \right] = \sigma_ {E \left(R _ {B}\right)} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {E \left(R _ {S}\right)} ^ {2} - 2 \operatorname {C o v} \left[ E \left(R _ {B}\right), E \left(R _ {S}\right) \right] \\ = . 0 0 0 0 6 4 +. 0 0 0 2 8 9 - 2 \times . 0 0 0 0 4 0 8 = . 0 0 0 2 7 1 4 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\sigma^ {2} (D) = . 0 0 0 3 +. 0 0 0 2 7 1 4 = . 0 0 0 5 7 1 4
$$

Given the large difference between the manager's and the baseline views, we would expect a significant change in the conditional expected returns from those of the baseline and, as a result, a very different optimal portfolio.

The expected returns conditional on the view is a function of four elements: the baseline expectations,  $E(R)$ ; the difference,  $D$ , between the manager's view and the baseline view (see Equation 27.13); the contribution of the asset return to the variance of  $D$ ; and the total variance of  $D$ . The result is:

$$
E (R | \text {v i e w}) = R + D \frac {\text {C o n t r i b u t i o n o f a s s e t t o} \sigma_ {D} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {D} ^ {2}}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} E \left(R _ {B} | P\right) = E \left(R _ {B}\right) + \frac {D \left\{\sigma_ {E \left(R _ {B}\right)} ^ {2} - \operatorname {C o v} \left[ E \left(R _ {B}\right) , E \left(R _ {S}\right) \right] \right\}}{\sigma_ {D} ^ {2}} \\ = . 0 1 4 0 + \frac {. 0 5 9 1 (\cdot 0 0 0 0 6 4 - . 0 0 0 0 4 0 8)}{. 0 0 0 5 7 1 4} = . 0 1 4 0 +. 0 0 2 4 = . 0 1 6 4 \tag {27.14} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} E (R _ {S} | P) = E (R _ {S}) + \frac {D \left\{\operatorname {C o v} \left[ E (R _ {B}) , E (R _ {S}) \right] - \sigma_ {E (R _ {S})} ^ {2} \right\}}{\sigma_ {D} ^ {2}} \\ = . 0 6 8 1 + \frac {. 0 5 9 1 (. 0 0 0 0 4 0 8 - . 0 0 0 2 8 9)}{. 0 0 0 5 7 1 4} = . 0 6 8 1 - . 0 2 5 7 = . 0 4 2 4 \\ \end{array}
$$

We see that the manager increases the expected returns on bonds by  $24\%$  to  $1.64\%$ , and reduces the expected return on stocks by  $2.57\%$  to  $4.24\%$ . The difference between the expected returns on stocks and bonds is reduced from  $5.41\%$  to  $2.60\%$ . While this is a very large change, we also realize that the manager's private view that  $Q = .5\%$  has been greatly tempered by the prior distribution to a value roughly halfway between the private view and the baseline view. In general, more precise views will have greater impact on the ultimate (i.e., "posterior") distribution.


The example we have described contains only two assets and one view. It can easily be generalized to any number of assets with any number of views about future returns. The views can be more complex than a simple difference between a pair of returns. Views can assign a value to any linear combination of the assets in the universe, and the confidence level (the covariance matrix of the set of  $\varepsilon$  values of the views) can allow for dependence across views. Thus, the model has great flexibility in quantifying a rich set of information. Appendix B to the chapter presents the general BL model.

# Step 5: Portfolio Optimization

At this point, the portfolio optimization follows the Markowitz procedure of Chapter 7, with an input list that replaces baseline expectations with the conditional expectations arising from the manager's view.

# Spreadsheet 27.2

Sensitivity of the Black-Litterman portfolio to confidence in views the revised (conditional) expectations. Figure 27.4 shows portfolio performance measured by  $M$ -square for various levels of confidence in the view when the view is correct and incorrect. The weight in bonds declines as the confidence in the view falls (the standard deviation of the view increases). With no confidence in the view (standard deviation very large), the weight in bonds falls to .3, determined by the baseline forecast. At this point, the portfolio is passive; its  $M$ -square is zero.

Figure 27.4 Sensitivity of Black-Litterman portfolio performance to confidence level


Notice that the  $M$ -square profile is asymmetric. With great confidence in the view and the resultant large position in bonds, the gain in  $M$ -square when the view is correct is smaller than the loss in  $M$ -square when the view is incorrect. With less confidence and therefore a smaller position in bonds, the "game" becomes more symmetric between a correct and incorrect view. Because determination of the confidence of a view is quite abstract, the graph tells us that to err on the side of skepticism may well be the prudent choice.

# 27.4 Treynor-Black versus Black-Litterman: Complements, Not Substitutes

Treynor, Black, and Litterman have earned a place among the important innovators of the investments industry. Wide implementation of their models could contribute much to the industry. The comparative analysis of their models presented here is not aimed at elevating one at the expense of the other—in any case, we find them complementary—but rather to clarify the relative merits of each.

First and foremost, once you reach the optimization stage, the models are identical. Put differently, if users of either model arrive at identical input lists, they will choose identical portfolios and realize identical performance measures. In Section 27.6, we show that these levels of performance potentially can be far superior to passive strategies, as well as to active strategies that do not take advantage of the quantitative techniques of these models. The models differ primarily in the way they arrive at the input list, and analysis of these differences shows that the models are true complements and are best used in tandem.

# The BL Model as Icing on the TB Cake

The Treynor-Black (TB) model is really oriented to individual security analysis. This can be seen from the way the active portfolio is constructed. The alpha values assigned to securities must be determined relative to the passive portfolio. This portfolio is the one that would be held if all alpha values turned out to be zero.

Now suppose an investment company prospectus mandates a portfolio invested  $70\%$  in a U.S. universe of large stocks, say, the S&P 500, and  $30\%$  in a well-defined universe of large European stocks. In that case, the macro analysis of the organization would have to be split, and the TB model would have to be run as two separate divisions. In each division, security analysts would compile values of alpha relative to their own passive portfolio. The product of this organization would thus include four portfolios, two passive and two active. This scheme is workable only when the portfolios are optimized separately. That is, the parameters (alpha, beta, and residual variance) of U.S. securities are estimated relative to the U.S. benchmark, while the parameters of European stocks are estimated relative to the European benchmark. Then the final portfolio would be constructed as a standard problem in asset allocation.

The resulting portfolio could be improved using the BL approach. First, views about the relative performance of the U.S. and European markets can be expected to add information to the independent macro forecasts for the two economies. For reasons of specialization, the U.S. and European macro analysts must focus on their respective economies. Obviously, when more country or regional portfolios are added to the company's universe, the need for decentralization becomes more compelling, and the potential of applying the BL model to the TB product greater. Moreover, the foreign-stock portfolios will result in various positions in local currencies. This is a clear area of international finance, and the only way to import forecasts from this analysis is with the BL technique.[9]

# Why Not Replace the Entire TB Cake with the BL Icing?

This question is raised by the need to use the BL technique if the overall portfolio is to include forecasts from comparative economic and international finance analyses. It is indeed possible to use the BL model for the entire process of constructing the efficient portfolio. The reason is that the alpha compiled for the TB model can be replaced with BL views. To take a simple example, suppose only one security makes up the active portfolio. With the TB model, we have macro forecasts,  $E(R_{M})$  and  $\sigma_{M}$ , as well as alpha, beta, and residual variance for the active portfolio. This input list also can be represented in the following form, along the lines of the BL framework:

$$
R = \left[ E \left(R _ {M}\right), E \left(R _ {A}\right) = \beta_ {A} E \left(R _ {M}\right) \right]
$$

$$
P = \left(0, 1 + \frac {\alpha_ {A}}{\beta_ {A} E (R _ {M})}\right)
$$

$$
P R _ {T} ^ {T} = Q + \varepsilon = \alpha_ {A} + \varepsilon \tag {27.15}
$$

$$
Q ^ {E} = 0
$$

$$
D = \alpha_ {A}
$$

$$
\sigma^ {2} (\varepsilon) = \operatorname {V a r} (\text {f o r e c a s t i n g e r r o r}) \text {i n} \tag {27.6}
$$

$$
\sigma^ {2} (D) = \sigma^ {2} (\varepsilon) + \sigma^ {2} (e)
$$ where  $e$  is the residual in the SCL regression of Equation 27.5. Calculation of the conditional expectations from Equation 27.15 as in Equation 27.13 will bring us to the same adjusted alpha as in Equation 27.7 of the TB model.


In this light, the BL model can be viewed as a generalization of the TB model. The BL model allows you to adjust expected return from views about alpha values as in the TB model, but it also allows you to express views about relative performance that cannot be incorporated in the TB model.

However, this conclusion might produce a false impression that is consequential to investment management. To understand the point, we first discuss the degree of confidence, which is essential to fully represent a view in the BL model. Spreadsheet 27.2 and Figure 27.4 illustrate that the optimal portfolio weights and performance are highly sensitive to the degree of confidence in the BL views. Thus, the validity of the model rests in large part on the way the confidence about views is arrived at.

When a BL view is structured to replace a direct alpha estimate in a TB framework, we must use the variance of the forecasting error taken from Equation 27.7 and applied to Equation 27.15. This is how "confidence" is quantified in the BL model. Whereas in the TB framework one can measure forecast accuracy by computing the correlation between analysts' alpha forecasts and subsequent realizations, such a procedure is not as easily applied to BL views about relative performance. Managers' views may be expressed about different quantities in different time periods, and, therefore, we will not have long forecast histories on a particular variable with which to assess accuracy. To our knowledge, no promotion of how to quantify "confidence" appears in academic or industry publications about the BL model.

This raises the issue of adjusting forecasts in the TB model. We are not aware of actual results where analysts' track records are systematically compiled and used to adjust alpha forecasts, although we cannot assert that such effort is nowhere expended. However, indirect evidence suggests that alphas are usually not adjusted, leading to the common "complaint" that the TB model is not applied in the field because it results in "wild" portfolio weights. Yet, as we saw in Section 27.3, those wild portfolio weights are a consequence of failing to adjust alpha values to reflect forecast precision. Any realistic  $R$ -square that can be obtained even by excellent forecasters will result in moderate portfolio weights. Even when "wild" weights do occasionally materialize, they can be "tamed" by a straightforward restriction on the variance of the tracking error.

It is therefore useful to keep the two models separate and distinct: the TB model for the management of security analysis with proper adjustment of forecasts and the BL model for asset allocation where views about relative performance are useful despite the fact that the degree of confidence must in practice be acknowledged as speculative.

# 27.5 The Value of Active Management

We showed in Chapter 24 that the value of successful market timing is enormous. Even a forecaster with far-from-perfect predictive power would contribute significant value. Nevertheless, active portfolio management based on security analysis has even greater potential. Even if each individual security analyst has only modest forecasting power, the power of a portfolio of analysts is potentially unbounded.

# A Model for the Estimation of Potential Fees

The value of market timing was derived from the value of an equivalent number of call options that mimic the return to the timer's portfolio. Thus, we were able to derive an unambiguous market value to timing ability, that is, we could price the implicit call in the timer's services. We cannot get quite that far with valuation of active portfolio management, but we can do the next best thing, namely, we can calculate what a representative investor would pay for such services.


Kane, Marcus, and Trippi derive an annuitized value of portfolio performance measured as a percentage of funds under management. The percentage fee,  $f$ , that investors would be willing to pay for active services can be related to the difference between the square of the portfolio Sharpe ratio and that of the passive portfolio as

$$ f = \left(S _ {P} ^ {2} - S _ {M} ^ {2}\right) / 2 A \tag {27.16}
$$ where  $A$  is the coefficient of the investor's risk aversion.


The source of the power of the active portfolio is the additive value of the squared information ratios  $\left(\frac{\alpha_i}{\sigma(e_i)}\right)$  and the precision of individual analysts. Recall the expression for the square of the Sharpe ratio of the optimized risky portfolio:

$$
S _ {P} ^ {2} = S _ {M} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \left[ \frac {\alpha_ {i}}{\sigma (e _ {i})} \right] ^ {2}
$$

Therefore,

$$ f = \frac {1}{2 A} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \left[ \frac {\alpha_ {i}}{\sigma \left(e _ {i}\right)} \right] ^ {2} \tag {27.17}
$$

Thus, the fee that can be charged,  $f$ , depends on three factors: (1) the coefficient of risk aversion, (2) the distribution of the squared information ratio in the universe of securities, and (3) the precision of the security analysts. Notice that this fee is in excess of what an index fund would charge. If an index fund charges about 10 basis points, the active manager could charge incremental fees above that level by the percentage given in Equation 27.17.

# Results from the Distribution of Actual Information Ratios

Kane, Marcus, and Trippi investigated the distribution of the squared information ratio, IR, for all S&P 500 stocks over two 5-year periods and estimated that this (annualized) expectation,  $E(\mathrm{IR}^2)$ , is in the range of .845 to 1.122. With client risk coefficient of risk aversion of 3, a portfolio manager who covers 100 stocks with security analysts whose  $R$ -square of forecasts with realized alpha is only .001 would still be able to charge an annual fee  $4.88\%$  higher than that of an index fund. This fee is based on the lower end of the range of the expected squared information ratio.

One limitation of this study is that it assumes that the portfolio manager knows the quality of the forecasts, however low they may be. As we have seen, portfolio weights are sensitive to forecast quality, and when that quality is estimated with error, performance will be further reduced.

# Results from Distribution of Actual Forecasts

A study of actual forecasts by Kane, Kim, and White (see footnote 3) found the distribution of over 11,000 alpha forecasts for over 600 stocks over 37 months presented in Figure 27.2. The average forecast precision from this database of forecasts provided an  $R$ -square of .00108. Despite this very low precision, when used to adjust forecasts and form optimal portfolios from 105 stocks, the annualized  $M$ -square measures of performance are quite impressive,  $2.67\%$  for the index model assuming no correlation across residuals, or  $3.01\%$  allowing for correlation. The conclusion is that even the smallest forecast ability can result in greatly improved performance.


# 27.6 Concluding Remarks on Active Management

A common concern of students of finance who encounter a heavy dose of theory laced with math and statistics is whether the analytical approach is necessary or even useful in practice. Here are some observations that should allay any such concern. Investment theory has developed in recent decades at a galloping pace. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, the distance between the basic science of investments and industry practice, one that exists in any field, has actually narrowed in recent years.

Yet there is one area in which practice still lags far behind theory, and that is the subject of this chapter—this despite the fact that TB and BL models have been around since 1973 and 1992, respectively. Yet, these models have so far failed to materially penetrate the industry. We hope that this situation will be remedied during your career!

1. Treynor-Black portfolio weights are sensitive to large alpha values, which can result in practically infeasible long/short portfolio positions. The full-blown Markowitz optimal risky portfolio is also extremely sensitive to assumptions for expected return.
2. Constraining tracking risk (i.e., the variance of the return difference between the managed and the benchmark portfolio) acts to keep the Treynor-Black portfolio within reasonable weights.
3. Alpha forecasts must be shrunk (adjusted toward zero) to account for less-than-perfect forecasting quality. Compiling past analyst forecasts and subsequent realizations allows one to estimate the correlation between realizations and forecasts. Regression analysis can be used to measure the forecast quality and guide the proper adjustment of future forecasts. When alpha forecasts are scaled back to account for forecast imprecision, the resulting portfolio positions become far more moderate.
4. The Black-Litterman model allows the private views of the portfolio manager to be incorporated with market data in the optimization procedure.
5. The Treynor-Black and Black-Litterman models are complementary tools. Both should be used: The TB model is more geared toward security analysis, while the BL model more naturally fits asset allocation problems.
6. Even low-quality forecasts are valuable. Almost imperceptible  $R$ -squares of only .001 in regressions of realizations on analysts' forecasts nevertheless can substantially improve portfolio performance when they are applied to large sets of securities.

# APPENDIX A: Forecasts and Realizations of Alpha

A linear representation of the process that generates forecasts from the (yet unknown) future values of alpha would be

$$
\alpha^ {f} (t) = b _ {0} + b _ {1} u (t) + \eta (t) \tag {27A.1}
$$ where  $\eta(t)$  is the forecasting error and is uncorrelated with the actual  $u(t)$ . Notice that when the forecast is optimized as in Equation 27.7, the error of the adjusted forecast,  $\varepsilon(t)$  in Equation 27.6, is uncorrelated with the optimally adjusted forecast  $\alpha(T)$ . The coefficients  $b_0$  and  $b_1$  are shift and scale biases in the forecast. Unbiased forecasts would result in  $b_0 = 0$  (no shift) and  $b_1 = 1$  (no scale bias).


We can derive both the variance of the forecast and the covariance between the forecast and realization from Equation 27A.1:

$$
\sigma^ {2} \left(\alpha^ {f}\right) = b _ {1} ^ {2} \times \sigma^ {2} (u) + \sigma^ {2} (\eta) \tag {27A.2}
$$

$$
\operatorname {C o v} \left(\alpha^ {f}, u\right) = b _ {1} \times \sigma^ {2} (u)
$$

Therefore, the slope coefficient,  $a_1$ , in Equation 27.6 is

$$ a _ {1} = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(u , \alpha^ {f}\right)}{\sigma^ {2} \left(\alpha^ {f}\right)} = \frac {b _ {1} \times \sigma^ {2} (u)}{b _ {1} ^ {2} \times \sigma^ {2} (u) + \sigma^ {2} (\eta)} \tag {27A.3}
$$

When the forecast has no scale bias, that is, when  $b_{1} = 1$ ,  $a_{1}$  equals the  $R$ -square of the regression of forecasts on realizations in Equation 27A.1, which also equals the  $R$ -square of the regression of realizations on forecasts in Equation 27.6. When  $b_{1}$  is different from 1.0, we must adjust the coefficient  $a_{1}$  to account for the scale bias. Notice also that with this adjustment,  $a_{0} = -b_{0}$ .

# APPENDIX B: The General Black-Litterman Model

The BL model is easiest to write using matrix notation. We describe the model according to the steps in Section 27.3.

# Steps 1 and 2: The Covariance Matrix and Baseline Forecasts

A sample of past excess returns of the universe of  $n$  assets is used to estimate the  $n \times n$  covariance matrix, denoted by  $\Sigma$ . It is assumed that the excess returns are normally distributed.

Market values of the universe assets are obtained and used to compute the  $1 \times n$  vector of weights  $w_{M}$  in the baseline equilibrium portfolio. The variance of the baseline portfolio is calculated from

$$
\sigma_ {M} ^ {2} = w _ {M} \sum w _ {M} ^ {T} \tag {27B.1}
$$

A coefficient of risk aversion for the representative investor in the economy,  $\overline{A}$ , is applied to the CAPM equation to obtain the baseline macro forecast for the market portfolio risk premium,

$$
E \left(R _ {M}\right) = \bar {A} \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} \tag {27B.2}
$$

The  $1 \times n$  vector of baseline forecasts for risk premiums of each security,  $E(R)$ , is computed from the macro forecast and the covariance matrix by

$$
E \left(R ^ {\prime}\right) = E \left(R _ {M}\right) \sum w _ {M} ^ {T} \tag {27B.3}
$$

The data so far describe the prior (baseline) distribution of the excess rates of return of the asset universe by

$$
\widetilde {R} \sim N [ E (R), \sum ] \tag {27B.4}
$$

The  $n \times n$  covariance matrix of the baseline expected excess returns,  $\tau \Sigma$ , is assumed proportional to the covariance matrix,  $\Sigma$ , by the scalar  $\tau$ .

# Step 3: The Manager's Private Views

The  $k \times n$  matrix of views,  $P$ , includes  $k$  views. The  $i$ th view is a  $1 \times k$  vector that multiplies the  $1 \times n$  vector of excess returns,  $\widetilde{R}$ , to obtain the value of the view,  $Q_{i}$  with forecasting error  $\varepsilon_{i}$ . The entire vector of view values and their forecasting errors is given by

$$
R P = Q + \varepsilon \tag {27B.5}
$$

The confidence of the manager in the views is given by the  $k \times k$  covariance matrix,  $\Omega$ , of the vector of errors in views,  $\varepsilon$ . The views embedded in the baseline forecast,  $R$ , are given by  $Q^{E}$

$$
R P = Q ^ {E}
$$

Thus, the  $1 \times k$  vector of deviation of the view from the baseline view (forecasts) and its covariance matrix  $S_{D}$  are

$$
D = Q ^ {E} - Q \tag {27B.6}
$$

$$
S _ {D} = \tau P \sum P ^ {T} + \Omega
$$

# Step 4: Revised (Posterior) Expectations

The  $1 \times n$  vector of posterior (revised) expectations conditional on the views, as well as the revised covariance matrix, is given by

$$
R ^ {*} = R | P = R + \tau D S _ {D} ^ {- 1} \sum P ^ {T}
$$

$$
\sum^ {*} = \sum + M \tag {27B.7}
$$

$$
M = \tau \sum - \tau \sum P ^ {T} S _ {D} ^ {- 1} P \tau \sum
$$

# Step 5: Portfolio Optimization

The vector of revised expectations is used in conjunction with the covariance matrix of excess returns to produce the optimal portfolio weights with the Markowitz algorithm.

# Investment Policy and the Framework of the CFA Institute

# 28

TRANSLATING THE ASPIRATIONS and circumstances of diverse households into appropriate investment decisions is a daunting task. Financial advisors must translate vague and nonquantitative concerns into concrete investment decisions. The task is equally difficult for institutions, most of which have many stakeholders and often are regulated by various authorities. The investment process is not easily reduced to a simple or mechanical algorithm.

While many principles of investments are quite general and apply to virtually all investors, some issues are peculiar to the specific investor. For example, tax bracket, age, risk tolerance, wealth, job prospects, and other uncertainties make each investor's circumstances somewhat unique. In this chapter, we ask how investors can systematically review their particular objectives, constraints, and circumstances. Along the way, we survey some of the major classes of institutional investors and examine the special issues they must confront.

There is no unique "correct" investment process. However, some approaches are better than others, and it can be helpful to take one high-quality approach as a useful case study. For this reason, we will examine the approach suggested by the CFA Institute. Among other things, the Institute administers examinations to certify investment professionals as Chartered Financial Analysts. Therefore, the approach we outline is also one that a highly respected professional group endorses through the curriculum that it requires investment practitioners to master.


The basic framework involves dividing the investment process into four stages: specifying objectives, specifying constraints, formulating policy, and later monitoring and updating the portfolio as needed. We treat each of these activities in turn. We start with an overview of the investment process and a description of the major types of investors, both individual and institutional. We then turn to the objectives and constraints peculiar to each investor class, asking how those factors influence investment policy.

We examine how the special circumstances of both individuals as well as institutions such as pension funds affect investment decisions. We also will see how the tax system can affect investment decisions.

# 28.1 The Investment Management Process

The CFA Institute divides the process of investment management into three main elements that constitute a dynamic feedback loop: planning, execution, and feedback. Figure 28.1 and Table 28.1 describe the steps in that process. As shorthand, you might think of planning as focused largely on establishing the inputs necessary for decision making. These include data about the client as well as the capital market, resulting in very broad policy guidelines (the strategic asset allocation). Execution fleshes out the details of optimal asset allocation and security selection. Finally, feedback is the process of adapting to changes in expectations and objectives as well as to changes in portfolio composition that result from changes in market prices.

The result of this analysis can be summarized in an investment policy statement addressing the topics specified in Table 28.2. In the next sections we elaborate on the steps leading to such an investment policy statement.

Table 28.1 indicates that the management planning process starts by analyzing one's investment clients—in particular, by considering the objectives and constraints that govern their decisions. Portfolio objectives center on the risk-return trade-off between the expected return the investors want (return requirements in the first column of Table 28.3) and how much risk they are willing to assume (risk tolerance). Investment managers must know the level of risk that can be tolerated in the pursuit of a higher expected rate of return.

Determination of portfolio policies

Investors also must deal with various constraints on their portfolio choice that derive from considerations such as liquidity needs, regulations, or tax concerns. The second column of Table 28.3 lists the more important constraints. In the next two sections, we explore some of these objectives and constraints.

Here is an example of a short quiz that may be used by financial institutions to help estimate risk tolerance.

<table><tr><td>Question</td><td>1 Point</td><td>2 Points</td><td>3 Points</td><td>4 Points</td></tr><tr><td>1. I plan on using the money I am investing:</td><td>Within 6 months.</td><td>Within the next 3 years.</td><td>Between 3 and 6 years.</td><td>No sooner than 7 years from now.</td></tr><tr><td>2. My investments make up this share of assets (excluding home):</td><td>More than 75\%.</td><td>50\% or more but less than 75\%.</td><td>25\% or more but less than 50\%.</td><td>Less than 25\%.</td></tr><tr><td>3. I expect my future income to:</td><td>Decrease.</td><td>Remain the same or grow slowly.</td><td>Grow faster than the rate of inflation.</td><td>Grow quickly.</td></tr><tr><td>4. I have emergency savings:</td><td>No.</td><td>No.</td><td>Yes, but less than I&#x27;d like to have.</td><td>Yes.</td></tr><tr><td>5. I would risk this share of my portfolio in exchange for the same probability of doubling my money:</td><td>Zero.</td><td>10\%.</td><td>25\%.</td><td>50\%.</td></tr><tr><td>6. I have invested in stocks and stock mutual funds:</td><td>No.</td><td>Yes, but I was uneasy about it.</td><td>No, but I look forward to it.</td><td>Yes, and I was comfortable with it.</td></tr><tr><td>7. My most important investment goal is to:</td><td>Preserve my original investment.</td><td>Receive some growth and provide income.</td><td>Grow faster than inflation but still provide some income.</td><td>Grow as fast as possible. Income is not important today.</td></tr></table>

Add the number of points for all seven questions. Add one point if you choose the first answer, two if you choose the second answer, and so on. If you score between 25 and 28 points, consider yourself an aggressive investor. If you score between 20 and 24 points, your risk tolerance is above average. If you score between 15 and 19 points, consider yourself a moderate investor. This means you are willing to accept some risk in exchange for a potential higher rate of return. If you score fewer than 15 points, consider yourself a conservative investor. If you have fewer than 10 points, you may consider yourself a very conservative investor.

# 28.2 Investor Objectives

Objectives and constraints vary widely across investor types. We begin with a brief overview of the broad objectives that characterize eight major categories of investors, focusing on their return objectives and tolerance for risk.

# Individual Investors

The basic factors affecting an individual investor's objectives usually arise from that person's stage in the life cycle. The first significant investment decision commonly concerns education, which is an investment in "human capital." The major asset most people have during their early working years is the earning power derived from their skills. At this stage of life, the financial risk due to illness or injury is far greater than that associated with the rate of return on their portfolios of financial assets. Therefore, the most important financial decisions concern insurance against the possibility of disability or death.

As one ages and accumulates savings to provide for consumption during retirement, the composition of wealth shifts from human capital toward financial capital. At this point, portfolio choices become progressively more important. In middle age, most investors will be willing to take on a meaningful amount of portfolio risk to increase their expected rates of return.


Questionnaires such as the one in the nearby box suggest that risk aversion increases as investors near retirement age. With age, individuals lose the potential to recover from disastrous investment performance. When they are young, they can respond to a loss by working harder (or further into their old age) and saving more of their income. But as retirement approaches, investors have less time to recalibrate their financial plans—hence, their decreasing tolerance for risk.

Personal Trusts Personal trusts are established when an individual confers legal title to property to another person or institution (the trustee) to manage that property for one or more beneficiaries. The trustee is usually a bank, a lawyer, or an investment professional. Investment of a trust is subject to trust laws, as well as "prudent investor" rules that limit investments to those that a prudent person would select.

Objectives for personal trusts normally are more limited in scope than those of individual investors. Because of their fiduciary responsibility, personal trust managers typically are more risk averse than are individual investors. Certain asset classes such as options and futures contracts, for example, and strategies such as short-selling or buying on margin are ruled out.

Mutual Funds Mutual funds are pools of investors' money. They invest in ways specified in their prospectuses and issue shares to investors entitling them to a pro rata portion of the income generated by the funds. The return requirement and risk tolerance across mutual funds are highly variable because funds segment the investor market. Various funds appeal to distinct investor groups and will adopt a return requirement and risk tolerance that fit a particular market niche. For example, income funds cater to the conservative investor, while high-growth funds seek out the more risk-tolerant ones. Tax-free bond funds segment the market by tax bracket. A mutual fund's orientation is spelled out in its prospectus.

Pension Funds Pension fund objectives depend on the type of pension plan. There are two basic types: defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. Defined contribution plans [e.g., 401(k) plans] are in effect tax-deferred retirement savings accounts, with the employee bearing all the risk and receiving all the return from the plan's assets. These plans are called defined contribution because the firm's only obligation is to make the stipulated contributions to the employee's retirement account. The employee is responsible for directing the management of the assets, usually by selecting among several investment funds in which the assets can be placed. Therefore, objectives for defined contribution plans are similar to those that would pertain to each individual investor.

In defined benefit plans, by contrast, the employer has an obligation to provide a specified annual retirement benefit. That benefit is defined by a formula that typically takes into account years of service and the level of salary or wages. For example, the employer may pay the retired employee a yearly amount equal to  $2\%$  of the employee's final annual salary for each year of service. Employees who had worked for 30 years would then receive an annual benefit equal to  $60\%$  of their final salary. The payments are an obligation of the employer, and the assets in the pension fund provide collateral for the promised benefits. If the investment performance of the assets is poor, the firm is obligated to make up the shortfall by contributing additional assets to the fund. Therefore, many defined benefit plans take an assumed rate of return for the asset portfolio as their return objective, with the risk surrounding investment performance borne by the firm. We discuss pension plans more fully later in this chapter.

Endowment Funds Endowment funds are organizations chartered to use their money for specific nonprofit purposes. They are financed by gifts from one or more sponsors and are typically managed by educational, cultural, and charitable organizations or by independent foundations established to carry out the fund's specific purposes. Generally, the investment objective is to produce a steady flow of income subject to only a moderate degree of risk. Moreover, because these funds often are envisioned as lasting for generations, they also seek to at least maintain the real value of the asset portfolio. Trustees of an endowment fund, however, can specify other objectives as dictated by specific circumstances.

Life Insurance Companies Life insurance companies generally try to invest so as to hedge their liabilities, which are defined by the policies they write. The company can reduce risk by investing in assets that will return more in the event the insurance policy coverage becomes more expensive.

For example, if the company writes a policy that pays a death benefit linked to the consumer price index, then the company is subject to inflation risk. It might search for assets expected to return more when the rate of inflation rises, thus hedging the price-index linkage of the policy.

Until the 1980s, there were for all practical purposes only two types of life insurance policies available for individuals: whole-life and term. A whole-life insurance policy combines a death benefit with a kind of savings plan that provides for a gradual buildup of cash value that the policyholder can withdraw at a later point in life, usually at retirement. Term insurance, on the other hand, provides death benefits only, with no buildup of cash value.

The interest rate embedded in the schedule of cash value accumulation promised under a whole-life policy is a fixed rate, and life insurance companies try to hedge this liability by investing in long-term bonds. Often the insured individual has the right to borrow at a prespecified fixed interest rate against the cash value of the policy. The life insurance company prices its policies based in part on an assumed interest rate, and thus needs to earn this rate to achieve its profit goals.

During the inflationary years of the 1970s and early 1980s, when many older whole-life policies carried contractual borrowing rates far lower than those available in the capital markets, policyholders borrowed heavily against the cash value to invest in money market mutual funds paying double-digit yields. In response, the insurance industry came up with two new policy types: variable life and universal life. Under a variable life policy, the insured's premium buys a fixed death benefit plus a cash value that can be invested in a variety of mutual funds. With a universal life policy, policyholders can increase or reduce the premium or death benefit according to their needs. Furthermore, the interest rate on the cash value component changes with market interest rates. One important advantage of variable and universal life insurance policies is that earnings on the cash value are not taxed until the money is withdrawn.

Non-Life Insurance Companies Non-life insurance companies such as property and casualty insurers have investable funds primarily because they pay claims after they collect policy premiums. Typically, they are conservative in their attitude toward risk. A common thread in the objectives of pension plans and insurance companies is the need to hedge predictable long-term liabilities. Investment strategies typically call for hedging these liabilities with bonds of various maturities.

Banks Most bank investments are loans to businesses and consumers, and most of their liabilities are accounts of depositors. As investors, banks try to match the risk of assets to liabilities while earning a profitable spread between the lending and borrowing rates.

Most liabilities of banks and thrift institutions are checking accounts, time or savings deposits, and certificates of deposit (CDs). Checking account funds may be withdrawn at any time, so they are of the shortest maturity. Time or savings deposits are of various maturities. Some time deposits may extend as long as several years, but, on average, they have fairly short maturity. CDs are bonds of various maturities that the bank issues to investors. While the range of maturities is from 90 days to 10 years, the average is about one year.

In the past, a large part of the loan portfolio of savings and loan (S&L) institutions was in home mortgages, with typical maturities of 15-30 years. Today, the bulk of thrifts' portfolios are business loans. The maturities of these loans typically are less than those of mortgages but still generally exceed the maturities of sources of financing. Thus, profits are exposed to interest rate risk. When rates rise, thrifts have to pay higher rates to depositors, while the income from their longer-term investments is relatively fixed.

Banks earn profit from the interest rate spread between loans extended (the bank's assets) and deposits and CDs (the bank's liabilities), as well as from fees for services. Managing bank assets calls for balancing the loan portfolio with the portfolio of deposits and CDs. A bank can increase the interest rate spread by increasing risk: lending to riskier borrowers, who pay higher rates, or increasing the proportion of higher-yielding longer-term loans. However, bank capital regulations are risk-based, so higher-risk strategies will elicit higher capital requirements as well as the possibility of greater regulatory interference in the bank's affairs.

As we noted in Chapter 2, most long-term fixed-rate mortgages today are securitized into pass-through certificates and held as securities in the portfolios of mutual funds, pension funds, and other institutional investors. Mortgage originators typically sell a portion of the mortgages they originate to pass-through agencies such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac rather than holding them in a portfolio. They earn their profits on mortgage origination and servicing fees. The trend away from maintaining portfolio holdings of long-term mortgages has reduced interest rate risk.

Table 28.4 summarizes the objectives pertaining to each of these investor classes.

<table><tr><td>Type of Investor</td><td>Return Requirement</td><td>Risk Tolerance</td></tr><tr><td>Individual</td><td>Life cycle (education, children, retirement)</td><td>Life cycle (younger can be more risk tolerant about financial wealth)</td></tr><tr><td>Personal trusts</td><td>Life cycle</td><td>Prudent investor rules</td></tr><tr><td>Mutual funds</td><td>Variable</td><td>Variable</td></tr><tr><td>Pension funds (Defined benefit)</td><td>Assumed actuarial rate</td><td>Depends on proximity of payouts</td></tr><tr><td>Endowment funds</td><td>Determined by current income needs as well as need for asset growth to maintain real value</td><td>Generally conservative</td></tr><tr><td>Life insurance companies</td><td>Should exceed new money rate by sufficient margin to meet expenses and profit objectives; actuarial rates also important</td><td>Conservative</td></tr><tr><td>Non-life insurance companies</td><td>Match to contingent liabilities</td><td>Conservative</td></tr><tr><td>Banks</td><td>Maintain positive spread over interest rate paid on deposits</td><td>Variable</td></tr></table>

# 28.3 Investor Constraints

Even with identical attitudes toward risk, different households and institutions might choose different investment portfolios because of their differing circumstances. These circumstances, which include tax status, requirements for liquidity or a flow of income from the portfolio, or various regulatory restrictions, impose constraints on investor choice. Together, objectives and constraints determine investment policy.

Some constraints arise from an investor's particular circumstances. For example, if a family has children about to enter college, there will be a high demand for liquidity because cash will be needed to pay tuition bills. Other times, however, constraints are imposed externally. For example, banks and trusts are subject to legal limitations on the types of assets they may hold in their portfolios. Finally, some constraints are self-imposed. For example, social investing means that investors will not hold shares of firms involved in ethically objectionable activities. Some criteria that have been used to judge firms as ineligible for a portfolio are involvement in countries with human rights abuses, production of tobacco or weapons, and participation in polluting activities.

Table 28.5 presents a matrix summarizing the main constraints for each of the eight types of investors. The following discussion elaborates on these constraints.

# Liquidity

Liquidity is the ease (and speed) with which an asset can be sold and still fetch a fair price. It is a relationship between the time dimension (how long will it take to sell) and the price dimension (any discount from intrinsic value) of an investment asset. (See the discussion of liquidity in Chapter 9.)

When a quantitative measure of liquidity is necessary, one thinks of the discount when an immediate sale is unavoidable. Cash and money market instruments such as Treasury bills and commercial paper, where the bid-ask spread is a small fraction of  $1\%$ , are the most liquid assets, and real estate is among the least liquid. Office buildings and manufacturing structures can potentially experience a  $50\%$  liquidity discount.

Both individual and institutional investors must consider how likely they are to dispose of assets at short notice. From this likelihood, they establish the minimum level of liquid assets they require in the investment portfolio.

# Table 28.5

Matrix of constraints

* The mutual fund itself does not pay taxes, as all investment income is “passed through” to investors. However, it may pay attention to taxes on behalf of its investors.

# Investment Horizon

This is the planned liquidation date of the investment or substantial part of it. Examples of an individual investment horizon could be the time to fund a child's college education or the retirement date for a wage earner. For a university endowment, an investment horizon could relate to the time to fund a major campus construction project. Horizon needs to be considered when investors choose between assets of various maturities, such as bonds, which pay off at specified future dates. For example, the maturity date of a bond might make it a more attractive investment if it coincides with a date on which cash is needed. This idea is analogous to the matching principle from corporate finance: Strive to match financing maturity to the economic life of the financed asset.

# Regulations

Professional and institutional investors are constrained by many regulations. First and foremost is the prudent investor rule. That is, professional investors have a responsibility to restrict investments to assets that would have been approved by a prudent investor. The law is purposefully nonspecific. The asset manager must stand ready to defend an investment policy, and interpretation may differ according to the standards of the times.

Registered investment advisers are bound by a fiduciary standard, meaning that they are required to work in the best interests of their clients, specifically, that they must place their clients' interests above their own. In contrast, brokers or advisers working for broker-dealer firms were until recently subject to a lower standard of suitability, meaning that their investment recommendations needed to be acceptable but not necessarily the best choice for the client. For example, a client's money might have been placed in a "suitable" mutual fund even if similar, cheaper funds (but offering the broker lower sales commissions) were available. The SEC's Regulation Best Interest, adopted in 2019, attempts to improve on the suitability standard by directing brokers to disclose conflicts of interest arising from their compensation packages and give greater consideration to clients' rather than their own interests.

Critics of the new regulation argue that it is too vague about how brokers should avoid decisions driven by personal considerations and whether the disclosure of potential conflicts will be sufficiently transparent and easy for clients to understand. While they might sound synonymous, "best interest" standards are not as rigorous as "fiduciary" standards, and the onus is on investors to understand the obligations and potential conflicts of any particular financial representative.

Also, specific regulations apply to various institutional investors. For instance, U.S. mutual funds are subject to regulations that put upper bounds on the allowed use of leverage or investments in illiquid securities and lower bounds on some measures of diversification.

# Tax Considerations

Tax consequences are central to investment decisions. The performance of any investment strategy is measured by how much it yields after taxes. For household and institutional investors who face significant tax rates, tax sheltering and deferral of tax obligations may be pivotal in their investment strategy. We put off an extensive discussion of tax considerations until later in the chapter.

# Unique Needs

Virtually every investor faces special circumstances. Imagine husband-and-wife aeronautical engineers holding high-paying jobs in the same aerospace corporation. The entire human capital of that household is tied to a single player in a rather cyclical industry. This couple would need to hedge the risk of a deterioration of the economic well-being of the aerospace industry by investing in assets that will yield more if such deterioration materializes.


Similar issues would confront an executive on Wall Street who owns an apartment near work. Because the value of the home in that part of Manhattan probably depends on the vitality of the securities industry, the individual is doubly exposed to the vagaries of the stock market. Because both job and home already depend on the fortunes of Wall Street, the purchase of a typical diversified stock portfolio would actually increase the exposure to the stock market.

These examples illustrate that the job, or, more generally, human capital, is often an individual's biggest "asset," and the unique risk profile that results from employment can play a big role in determining a suitable investment portfolio.

Other unique needs of individuals often center around their stage in the life cycle. Retirement, housing, and children's education constitute three major demands for funds, and investment policy will depend in part on the proximity of these expenditures.

Institutional investors also face unique needs. For example, pension funds will differ in their investment policy, depending on the average age of plan participants. Another example of a unique need for an institutional investor would be a university whose trustees allow the administration to use only cash income from the endowment fund. This constraint could engender a preference for high-dividend-paying assets.

A particular constraint for mutual funds arises from investor response to the fund's performance. When a mutual fund earns an unsatisfactory rate of return, investors often redeem their shares—they withdraw money from the fund. The mutual fund then contracts. This dynamic creates liquidity needs, which constitute a constraint on investment strategy.

Pension funds are heavily regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). This law revolutionized savings for retirement in the U.S. and remains a major piece of social legislation. Thus, for pension funds, regulatory constraints are relatively important. Also, mature pension funds are required to pay out more than young funds and hence need more liquidity.

Life insurance companies are subject to complex regulation. The corporate tax rate, which currently is  $21\%$ , also applies to insurance company investment income, so taxes are an important concern.

Property and casualty insurance, like term life insurance, is written on a short-term basis. Most policies must be renewed annually, which means property and casualty insurance companies are subject to short-term horizon constraints.

The short horizon constraint for banks comes from the interest rate risk component of the interest rate spread (i.e., the risk of interest rate increases that banks face when financing long-term assets with short-term liabilities). Risk-based capital regulations, which mandate higher capital requirements for riskier investment portfolios, also impose constraints on bank portfolio choice.

# Concept Check 28.1 a. Think about the financial circumstances of your closest relative in your parents' generation (e.g., your parents' household if you are fortunate enough to have them around). Write down the objectives and constraints for their investment decisions.


b. Now consider the financial situation of your closest friend or relative who is in about 35 years old. Write down the objectives and constraints that would fit that individual's investment decision.

c. How much of the difference between the two statements is due to the age of the investors?

# 28.4 Policy Statements

Once objectives and constraints are determined, an investment policy that suits the investor can be formulated. That policy must reflect an appropriate risk-return profile as well as address needs for liquidity, income generation, and tax positioning. Institutional investors such as pension plans and endowments often must issue formal statements of their investment policy. These policy statements should be based on, and often make explicit, the objectives and constraints of the investment fund.

The investment policy statement (IPS) serves as a strategic guide to the planning and implementation of an investment program. When implemented successfully, the IPS anticipates issues related to governance of the investment program, planning for appropriate asset allocation, implementing an investment program with internal and/or external managers, monitoring the results, risk management, and appropriate reporting. The IPS also establishes accountability for the various entities that may work on behalf of an investor. Perhaps most important, the IPS serves as a policy guide that can offer an objective course of action to be followed during periods of disruption when emotional or instinctive responses might otherwise motivate less prudent actions.

The nearby box suggests desirable components of an investment policy statement for use with individual and/or high net worth investors. Not every component will be appropriate for every investor or every situation, and there may be other components that are desirable for inclusion reflecting unique investor circumstances.

# Sample Policy Statements for Individual Investors

Perhaps the best way to get a concrete feel for deriving actual policy statements is to consider a sample of such statements for a variety of investors. Therefore, we next present several examples.

# 1. Scope and Purpose

# 1a. Define the context:

A preamble is often useful to relate information about the investor and/or the source of wealth as a way of establishing the context in which an investment program will be implemented.

Example: "The assets of the Leveaux family trusts trace back to the establishment of Leveaux Vintners in 1902 by Claude Leveaux. In 1979, LVX Industries was purchased by the British conglomerate FoodCo. Michelle Leveaux established the Leveaux Foundation with 100 million of the sale proceeds, and much of the remainder constituted the Leveaux Family Trusts, which are the subject of this investment policy statement."

# 1b. Define the investor:

Define who the investor is, be it a natural person or legal/corporate entity.

Example: "This Investment Policy Statement governs the personal investment portfolios of Mr. Chen Guangping."

# 1c. Define the structure:

Set forth key responsibilities and actors.

Example: "Janice Jones, as financial adviser to Sam and Mary Smith, is responsible for coordinating updates to the Investment Policy. Sam and Mary Smith shall be responsible for approving the Investment Policy Statement."

# Desirable Components of an Investment Policy Statement for Individual Investors

# SCOPE AND PURPOSE

Define the context

Define the investor

Define the structure

# GOVERNANCE

Specify responsibility for determining investment policy

Describe process for review of IPS

Describe responsibility for engaging/discharging external advisers

Assign responsibility for determination of asset allocation

Assign responsibility for risk management

# INVESTMENT, RETURN, AND RISK OBJECTIVES

Describe overall investment objective

State return, distribution, and risk requirements

Determine the risk tolerance of the investor

Describe relevant constraints

Describe other relevant considerations

# RISK MANAGEMENT

Establish performance measurement accountabilities

Specify appropriate metrics for risk measurement

Define a process by which portfolios are rebalanced.

Set forth a "standard of care" for those serving as adviser. Regulations in different jurisdictions may allow for advisers to abide by different standards depending on their preferences, business models, and client preferences. Fiduciary standards generally require that advisers always hold client interests as foremost, whereas suitability standards require recommendations that are suitable for an investor based on the adviser's knowledge of that investor's circumstances.

Example: "Fuji Advisors acts as a fiduciary in its capacity as adviser to the Takesumi Family Accounts, and acknowledges that all advice and decisions rendered must reflect first and foremost the best interests of its clients."

# 2. Governance

2a. Specify who is responsible for determining investment policy, executing investment policy, and monitoring the results of implementation of the policy. The IPS assigns responsibility for all stages of investment policy development and implementation.
2b. Describe the process for review and updating of the IPS. A process for refreshing the IPS as investor circumstances and/or market conditions change should be clearly identified in advance.

Example: "Wanda Wood is responsible for monitoring the investing requirements of Sam and Susan Smith as well as investment and economic issues, and for suggesting changes to the IPS as necessary, and no less frequently than annually."

2c. Describe the responsibilities for engaging or discharging external advisers. The IPS should set forth who is responsible for hiring and firing external money managers, consultants, or other vendors associated with the investment assets.
2d. Assign responsibility for determination of asset allocation, including inputs used and criteria for development of input assumptions. An asset allocation framework provides strategic context to many of the more tactical (shorter-term) investment decisions. The IPS should address the assumptions used in developing and selecting inputs to the asset allocation decision process.

Example: "At least annually, Tower Advisors shall review the asset allocation of the Family Investment Accounts, and suggest revisions for final approval by James and Jennifer Jensen. Tower Advisors shall consider expected returns and correlation of returns for a broad representation of asset classes in the U.S. capital markets, as well as anticipated changes in the rate of inflation, and changes in marginal tax rates."

2e. Assign responsibility for risk management, monitoring, and reporting. The IPS should document who is responsible for setting risk policy, monitoring the risk profile of the investment portfolio, and reporting on portfolio risk.

3. Investment, Return, and Risk Objectives

3a. Describe overall investment objective. The IPS should relate the purpose of the assets being invested to a broad investment objective.

Example: "The investment program governed by the IPS is intended to supplement the earned income of Marcel Perrold as well as to provide for funds upon his retirement in 2030."

3b. State the return, distribution, and risk requirements.

State the overall investment performance objective. Careful specification of the overall investment performance objective is likely to incorporate descriptions of general funding needs as well as relations to key factors (such as inflation, spending rate, etc.).

Example: "The financial plan developed for Margarita Mendez indicates a required real growth rate of  $4\%$  to satisfy her future obligations and allow her to retire in 2034 as planned."

Identify performance objectives for each asset class eligible for investment. The investment policy statement should set forth all permissible asset classes in which the portfolio may be invested. Some investors may wish to risk-adjust the benchmark return and portfolio return for purposes of comparison.

Example: "The Family Trust accounts may invest in U.S. equity, U.S. fixed income, U.S. money market, and Developed Country international equity securities. The following benchmarks have been selected for comparison to each asset class: U.S. equity: Russell 3000 index; U.S. fixed income: Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index; U.S. money market: Lipper U.S. Government Money Market Average; Developed Country international equity securities: MSCI EAFE index."

Define distribution/spending assumptions or policies. Spending or distributions from the portfolio should be defined.

Example: "Based on the overall expected portfolio return of  $7.5\%$ , fees of  $1.2\%$ , inflation of  $2.8\%$ , and an effective tax rate of  $32\%$  of total appreciation, the Linzer Trust Portfolio may support an annual spending rate of  $1.2\%$  of the portfolio market value while retaining potential for capital preservation or nominal growth."

Define a policy portfolio to serve as a basis for performance and risk assessments. An asset allocation policy should designate target allocations to each asset class, with allowable ranges around the targets.

3c. Determine the risk tolerance of the investor.

Describe the investor's general philosophy regarding tolerance of risk. The IPS should acknowledge the assumption of risk and the potential for returns associated with risk to be both positive and negative over time. Relevant risks are usually myriad, and may include liquidity, legal, political, regulatory, longevity, mortality, business, and/or health risks.


Example: "Tower Advisors understands that an absolute loss in any 12-month period of more than  $-33\%$  is intolerable."

3d. Describe relevant constraints. Investors must address a variety of constraints that affect their investment programs. Such constraints may reflect legal or regulatory imperatives or may reflect internal policies.

Define an evaluation horizon for achievement of performance objectives.

Establishing a minimum time horizon for achievement of performance objectives makes clearer when action may need to be taken to resolve underperformance issues.

Example: "The basis for evaluation of relative success in achieving investment objectives will be on a rolling 8-quarter basis."

Identify any requirements for maintaining liquidity. Investors may have short- or medium-term needs for cash, which should be specified in the IPS.

Example: "Up to  $15\%$  of the market value of the portfolio should be invested such that it could be liquidated upon five days' notice without suffering capital depreciation."

Identify to what extent, if any, tax considerations shall affect investment decision making. The investor's general tax situation as well as specific tax issues should be accounted for in the investment policy statement.

Identify any relevant legal constraints.

Example: "Management of the Aquilla Family Foundation account is subject to the provisions of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act."

Specify any policies related to leverage. The ability to leverage portfolios may be constrained by policy or relevant statute.

Example: "At the discretion of Tower Advisors as investment manager, the Xie Weng portfolio may be marginined up to  $50\%$  of its value."

3e. Describe other considerations relevant to investment strategy.

Identify special factors to be used in including or excluding potential investments from the portfolio. Investors may choose to impose limits on certain investments, consistent with their beliefs in extra-financial factor effects on securities prices.

Example for an Individual Investor: "Consistent with her personal beliefs, no investments in companies that derive revenue from products or services that are contrary to the teachings of the Catholic Church will be made for Jennifer Jensen's account."

4. Risk Management and Performance Review

4a. Establish performance measurement and reporting accountabilities. The IPS should establish an objective, reliable mechanism for reporting on investment performance.

Example for an Individual Investor: "Hill Counsel will calculate and report the performance of each investment account by the 15th day of the new quarter. Calculations will be performed consistent with the Global Investment Performance Standards published by CFA Institute."

4b. Specify appropriate metrics for risk measurement and evaluation. Consistent use of metrics to assess and evaluate the risk profile of investment portfolios is important to allow for meaningful comparisons over time.

Example for an Individual Investor: "In addition to performance reporting, Tower Capital shall report to the Marcel Family Trust trustees indicative risk metrics, such as the standard deviation and information ratio of portfolio returns relative to each portfolio's specified benchmark."

4c. Define a process by which portfolios are rebalanced to target allocations.

Boundaries of acceptable variations from target should be specified.

Example for an Individual Investor: "On the first business day of each new quarter, the investment adviser for the Jensen personal accounts will propose rebalancing transactions to return the accounts to their target allocations, and shall execute these transactions within two business days."

# 28.5 Asset Allocation

Consideration of their objectives and constraints leads investors to a set of investment policies. The policies column in Table 28.3 lists the various dimensions of portfolio management policymaking—asset allocation, diversification, risk and tax positioning, and income generation. By far the most important part of policy determination is asset allocation, that is, deciding how much of the portfolio to invest in each major asset category.

We can view the process of asset allocation as consisting of the following steps:

1. Specify asset classes to be included in the portfolio. The major classes usually considered are the following:

$a$ . Money market instruments (usually called cash).
$b$ . Fixed-income securities (usually called bonds).
c. Stocks, both U.S. and non-U.S.
d. Real estate.
e. Precious metals.
$f$ . Alternative assets such as private equity or hedge funds.

2. Specify capital market expectations. This step consists of using both historical data and economic analysis to determine your expectations of future rates of return over the relevant holding period on the assets to be considered for inclusion in the portfolio. (Look back at Figure 28.1 and Table 28.1, and you will see that the CFA Institute classifies this part of the planning process as the formation of "capital market expectations.")
3. Derive the efficient portfolio frontier. This step consists of finding portfolios that achieve the maximum expected return for any given degree of risk.
4. Find the optimal asset mix. This step consists of selecting the efficient portfolio that best meets your risk and return objectives while satisfying the constraints you face. Given the risk-return positioning of the investor and the set of expectations, an optimal asset mix may be formed (see Panel II, Execution, in Table 28.1).

# Top-Down Asset Allocation for Institutional Investors

Individual investors need not concern themselves with organizational efficiency. But professional investors with large amounts to invest must structure asset allocation activities to decentralize some of the decision making.

Common features of large organizations are the investment committee and the asset universe. The investment committee includes top management officers, senior portfolio managers, and senior security analysts. The committee determines investment policies and verifies that portfolio managers and security analysts are operating within the bounds of specified policies. A major responsibility of the investment committee is to translate the objectives and constraints of the company into an asset universe, an approved list of assets for each of the company's portfolios.


The investment committee has responsibility for broad asset allocation. While the investment manager might have some leeway to tilt the portfolio toward or away from one or another asset class, the investment committee establishes the benchmark allocation that largely determines the risk characteristics of the portfolio. The task of choosing specific securities from the approved universe is more fully delegated to the investment manager.

Figure 28.2 illustrates the stages of the portfolio choice process for Palatial Investments, a hypothetical firm that invests internationally. The first two stages are asset allocation choices. The broadest choice is in the weighting of the portfolio between U.S. and Japanese securities. Palatial has chosen a weight of  $75\%$  in the United States and  $25\%$  in Japan. The allocation of the portfolio across asset classes may now be determined. For example,  $15\%$  of the U.S. portfolio is invested in cash equivalents,  $40\%$  in fixed income, and  $45\%$  in equity. The asset-class weights are, in general, a policy decision of the investment committee, although investment managers might have some authority to alter the asset allocation to limited degrees based on their expectations concerning the investment performance of various asset classes. Finally, security selection within each country is determined by the portfolio manager from the approved universe. For example,  $45\%$  of funds held in the U.S. equity market will be placed in IBM,  $35\%$  in GM, and  $20\%$  in ExxonMobil. (We show only three securities in the figure because of space limitations. Obviously a 1 billion fund will hold securities of many more firms.)

These ever-finer decisions determine the proportion of each individual security in the overall portfolio. As an example, consider the proportion of Palatial's portfolio invested in ExxonMobil,  $6.75\%$ . This fraction results from the following decisions: First, the United States receives a weight of  $75\%$  of the overall portfolio, and equities comprise  $45\%$  of the U.S. component of the portfolio. These are asset allocation choices. ExxonMobil comprises  $20\%$  of the U.S. equity component of the portfolio. This is a security selection choice. Therefore, ExxonMobil's weight in the overall portfolio is  $.75 \times .45 \times .20 = .0675$ , or  $6.75\%$ . If the entire portfolio is \$1 billion, \$67,500,000 will be invested in ExxonMobil. If ExxonMobil is selling for 45 a share, 1.5 million shares must be purchased. The bottom line in Figure 28.2 shows the percentage of the overall portfolio held in each asset.

Figure 28.2 Asset allocation and security selection for Palatial Investments


This example illustrates a top-down approach that is consistent with the needs of large organizations. The top managers set the overall policy of the portfolio by specifying asset allocation guidelines. Lower-level portfolio managers fill in the details with their security selection decisions.

# Monitoring and Revising the Portfolio

Choosing the investment portfolio requires the investor to set objectives, acknowledge constraints, determine asset-class proportions, and perform security analysis. Is the process ever finished and behind us? By the time we have completed all of these steps, many of the inputs we have used will be out of date. Moreover, investor circumstances as well as objectives change over time. Therefore, the investment process requires that we continually monitor and update our portfolios. This is the task of rebalancing, part of the feedback process described earlier in Table 28.1 and Figure 28.1.

Asset allocation also will change over time as the investment performance of different asset classes diverges. If the stock market outperforms the bond market, the proportion of your portfolio invested in stocks will increase while the proportion invested in bonds will decrease. If you are uncomfortable with this shift in the asset mix, you must rebalance the portfolio by selling some of the stocks and purchasing bonds.

Therefore, investing is a dynamic process, meaning that you must continually update and reevaluate your decisions over time.

# 28.6 Managing Portfolios of Individual Investors

Now that we have outlined general considerations for investment policy, we can look at the particular issues that confront a range of investors. We begin with issues relevant to individuals.

# Investment in Residence

The first major economic asset many people acquire is their own house. Deciding to buy rather than rent a residence qualifies as an investment decision.

An important consideration in assessing the risk and return aspects of this investment is the value of a house as a hedge against two kinds of risk. The first is the risk of increases in rental rates, which make housing services more expensive. If you own a house, this increase in the cost of housing (bad news) will increase the return on your investment in housing (good news, and therefore a hedge).

The second kind of risk is that the particular house or apartment where you live may not always be available to you. By buying, you guarantee its availability.

# Saving for Retirement and the Assumption of Risk

People save and invest money to provide for future consumption and leave an estate. The primary aim of lifetime savings is to allow maintenance of the customary standard of living after retirement. As Figure 28.3 suggests, your retirement consumption depends on your life expectancy at that time. Life expectancy, conditional on retirement at age 66, www.glasbergen.com. Copyright 2000 by Randy Glasbergen. Reprinted by permission of Randy Glasbergen.

Figure 28.3 Long life expectancy is a double-edged sword


approximates 86 years, so the average retiree needs to prepare a 20-year nest egg as well as sufficient savings to cover unexpected health care costs or the "risk" of living longer and outlasting your savings. Investment income may also increase the welfare of one's heirs, favorite charity, or both.

# Retirement Planning Models

There are many online retirement planners. You can find links to several of them at the American Savings Educational Council (ASEC) website: www .choosefosave.org/calculators/. (ASEC is a program of the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Look for their calculator under the Tools tab.) These calculators all follow similar logic. First, estimate the value of your total assets as of the date you retire. This will depend on your current assets, your projected savings rate, and the projected rate of return. Using this forecast of retirement wealth, an assumed interest rate at retirement, and a life expectancy, you can calculate the annual income annuity your retirement wealth can generate. Then you add the income you might continue to receive in retirement, for example, from

Social Security, a defined-benefit pension plan, or part-time work. The resulting estimate of total retirement income is then compared to your current wage and its forecasted growth rate to give you a forecast of your "replacement rate" income: the fraction of your salary in your last working year that you will continue to receive in retirement. If the replacement rate is too low, you need to consider either a more aggressive savings plan or a later age of retirement.

Figure 28.4 shows the results of this sort of analysis from ASEC's "Ballpark E\$timate" calculator. There are 16 inputs. The calculator reports both your replacement rate based on current assumptions (in this case  $71\%$ ) as well as the savings rate necessary to support your targeted replacement rate (here chosen to be  $90\%$ ).

This is actually a very simple example of available calculators. Others can determine appropriate interest rates for you based on market data and can enforce consistency across your inputs (e.g., between interest and inflation rates). In addition, rather than a single scenario, they can perform statistical simulation models that allow for uncertainty in wage growth, rates of return, inflation rates, and so on, thus providing for probabilistic assessments of the likelihood of meeting retirement goals.

# Target Date Funds

A target-date retirement fund (TDRF) is a fund composed of other funds, diversified across stocks, bonds, and money market accounts, in which the asset allocation becomes progressively more conservative as the investor approaches retirement. TDRFs are often advocated as a simple solution to the complex task of determining the appropriate asset allocation among funds in 401(k) plans, IRAs, and other personal investment accounts. TDRFs are marketed as enabling individuals to put their investment plans on autopilot. Once you choose a fund with a target year matching your investment horizon, the life-cycle manager gradually moves some of your money out of stocks and into bonds as your retirement date nears.

# Tax Sheltering and Asset Allocation

Three important tax deferral options can meaningfully affect optimal asset allocation for individual investors. Tax deferral generally refers to putting off investment taxes until the future, thus allowing your portfolio to grow at a tax-free or at least tax-advantaged rate.

One tax-deferral option derives from the fact that you do not have to pay tax on a capital gain until that gain is realized. Under the U.S. tax code, capital gains taxes are paid only when the asset is sold. Delaying the sale thus delays the tax bill. Therefore, investing in stocks (where a substantial component of total return is in the form of capital gains versus dividend income), may be preferred to bonds (where the dominant portion of total return is in the form of immediately taxed interest income). Moreover, the tax rate on realized capital gains is generally lower than the rate paid on interest income.


The second major tax-deferral option derives from tax-protected retirement plans such as individual retirement accounts (IRAs) or 401(k) plans. In so-called traditional plans contributions to your retirement account are not subject to federal income tax until you withdraw funds during retirement. We therefore say that these contributions are funded with pretax income. Investment earnings also are not taxed until they are withdrawn from the account. In contrast, in Roth-style plans (named after the late Senator William Roth of Delaware), you pay taxes on your income in the year it is earned, and therefore fund your retirement plan with after-tax dollars. However, the investment income earned in these plans is then exempt from taxes when withdrawn in future years.

Finally, investment products such as tax-deferred annuities offered by life insurance companies combine deferral of taxes with the option to ultimately withdraw one's funds in the form of a lifetime annuity. Because these annuities continue for your entire lifetime, they offer longevity insurance: You do not have to worry about outliving your savings. The insurance company assumes your mortality risk. Variable annuity contracts also allow you to invest the funds backing your policy in a variety of mutual funds. The amount one can contribute to a deferred annuity is unlimited but is not tax-deductible. On the other hand, investment earnings in the account are not taxed. In this respect, they are similar in tax treatment to Roth-style accounts.

The Tax-Deferral Option A fundamental feature of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code is that tax on a capital gain on an asset is payable only when the asset is sold; this is its tax-deferral option. The investor therefore can control the timing of the tax payment. This conveys a benefit to stock investments.

To see this, compare IBM stock with an IBM bond. Suppose both offer an expected total (pretax) return of  $12\%$ . The stock has a dividend yield of  $4\%$  and expected price appreciation of  $8\%$ , whereas the bond pays an interest rate of  $12\%$ . The bond investor must pay tax on the bond's interest in the year it is earned, whereas the stockholder pays tax only on the dividend and defers paying capital gains tax until the stock is sold.

Suppose one invests 1,000 for five years. Although in reality interest is taxed as ordinary income while capital gains and dividends are taxed at a rate of only 15\% for many investors,[2] to isolate the benefit of tax deferral, we will assume that all investment income is taxed at 15\%. The bond will earn an after-tax return of 12\% \times (1 - .15) = 10.2\%. The after-tax accumulation at the end of five years is

$$
\$ 1,000 \times 1.102 ^ {5} = \$ 1,625.20
$$

For the stock, the dividend yield after taxes is  $4\% \times (1 - .15) = 3.4\%$ . Because no taxes are paid on the  $8\%$  annual capital gain until year 5, the before-tax accumulation will be

$$
\$ 1,000 \times (1 + .034 + .08) ^ {5} = 1,000 (1.114) ^ {5} = \$ 1,715.64
$$

In year 5, when the stock is sold, the (now-taxable) capital gain is

$$
\$ 1,715.64 - \$ 1,000 (1.034) ^ {5} = 1,715.64 - 1,181.96 = \$ 533.68
$$

Before selecting an investment adviser, you should know what services you're paying for, how much those services cost, how the adviser gets paid, and what conflicts of interest the adviser may have when giving you investment advice. If you have a registered investment adviser, review the firm's brochure when you first receive it and when it is updated by the firm—there's a wealth of valuable information in there! And if you don't recall receiving the brochure, request it. You can also find the brochure on the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) Web site.

Here are some of the questions to ask when evaluating an investment adviser:

1. Are you registered with the SEC, a state, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)?
2. Have you or your firm ever been disciplined by any regulator? If yes, for what reasons and how was the matter resolved?

3. Have you ever been sued by a client who was not happy with your work, the services you provided, or the products you recommended?
4. How are you paid for your services? What is your usual hourly rate, flat fee, or commission?
5. What experience do you have, especially with people in my circumstances?
6. Where did you go to school? What is your recent employment history?
7. What products and services do you offer? Are you only supposed to recommend a limited number of products or services to me? If so, why?

Taxes due are  \$80.05, leaving\$ 1,635.59, which is 10.39 more than the bond investment yields. Deferral of the capital gains tax allows the investment to compound at a faster rate until the tax is actually paid. The more of one's total return that is in the form of price appreciation, the greater the value of the tax-deferral option.

Tax-Protected Retirement Plans Recent years have seen increased use of tax-protected retirement plans in which investors can choose how to allocate assets. Such plans include traditional IRAs, Keogh plans, and employer-sponsored "tax-qualified" defined contribution plans such as 401(k) plans. A feature these so-called traditional plans have in common is that contributions and earnings are not subject to federal income tax until the individual withdraws them as benefits.

Typically, an individual may have some investments in the form of such qualified retirement accounts and some in the form of ordinary taxable accounts. The basic tax-sheltering principle is to hold whatever bonds you want to hold in the retirement account while holding equities in the ordinary account. You maximize the tax advantage of the retirement account by holding it in the security that is the least tax advantaged.

To see this point, consider an investor who has  \$200,000 of wealth, of which\$ 100,000 is in a tax-qualified retirement account. She currently invests half of her wealth in bonds and half in stocks, so she allocates half of her retirement account and half of her nonretirement funds to each. She could reduce her tax bill with no change in before-tax returns simply by shifting her bonds into the retirement account and holding all her stocks outside the retirement account.

# Concept Check 28.2

Suppose our investor earns a  $10\%$  per year rate of interest on bonds and a  $15\%$  per year return on stocks, with all earnings reinvested. In five years, she will withdraw all her funds and spend them. By how much will she increase her final accumulation if she shifts all bonds into the retirement account and holds all stocks outside the retirement account? Assume the tax rate on interest income as well as the tax rate on ordinary income is  $28\%$ , while the tax rate on capital gains is  $15\%$ . Also assume that equity income is entirely in the form of capital gains, on which taxes are not paid until the investor cashes in the fund in five years.

Traditional IRA and  $401(\mathrm{k})$  plans allow investors to avoid taxes on current income because the funds contributed to the retirement plan are not taxed in the current year. But all the proceeds (both the original contribution and the subsequent investment earnings) are taxed at withdrawal. In contrast, Roth plans allow investors to contribute after-tax income to the retirement plan (so there is no tax break in the current year), but they then avoid taxation of future investment income. To compare the plans, think about an employee in a  $30\%$  tax bracket with \$10,000 in income that will be invested in either a traditional or Roth tax-sheltered plan. Assume that the invested funds will earn  $8\%$  per year and be invested for 20 years, at which point the worker will retire.

Suppose first that the 10,000 is put in a traditional IRA or 401(k) plan. The worker actually forgoes only 7,000 in current consumption, as 30\% of that money would have been taxed had it not been sheltered in the retirement plan. The 10,000 will grow after 20 years to 10,000 \times 1.08^{20} = \46,609.57 . But when the worker withdraws the funds, they are fully taxable, so net-of-tax proceeds are only \46,609.57 \times (1 - .30) = \32,626.70

In a Roth plan, taxes are paid on the  \$10,000 of income in the year it is earned. So only\$ 7,000 is available to invest. But the investment earnings are all tax-free, so the funds will grow to  $7,000 \times 1.08^{20} = \$ 32,626.70$ with no further tax liability—exactly the same as under the traditional plan. At first glance, it looks like the traditional and Roth plans are equally attractive. In one case, you pay 30\% taxes on the original value; in the other, you pay 30\% on the final accumulated value. But there are some salient differences.

First, if your tax rate will change over time, you may prefer one plan over the other. For those who believe that their income (and therefore their marginal tax rate) will be significantly lower in retirement, the traditional plan may be preferred, as the tax savings when the contribution is made are greater than the tax rate paid when funds are withdrawn in retirement. On the other hand, if you predict an increase in tax rates, you may prefer the Roth plan.

When the funds that can be put into a plan are limited by law (as is the case in the U.S.), the Roth plan offers a more subtle advantage. Suppose you may put a maximum of  \$10,000 into a 401(k) plan. Under the traditional plan, you can put aside at most\$ 10,000 in pretax dollars (equivalent to \$7,000 in after-tax dollars at a tax rate of 30\%). In the Roth plan, you can put aside \$10,000 in after-tax dollars, equivalent to 13,333 in pretax dollars.

Deferred Annuities Deferred annuities are essentially tax-sheltered accounts offered by life insurance companies. They combine deferral of taxes with the option of withdrawing one's funds in the form of a life annuity. Variable annuity contracts offer the additional advantage of mutual fund investing. One major difference between an IRA and a variable annuity contract is that whereas the amount one can contribute to an IRA is tax-deductible and extremely limited as to maximum amount, the amount one can contribute to a deferred annuity is unlimited, but the contribution is not tax-deductible.

The defining characteristic of a life annuity is that its payments continue as long as the recipient is alive, although virtually all deferred annuity contracts have several withdrawal options, including a lump sum of cash paid out at any time. You need not worry about running out of money before you die. Like Social Security, therefore, life annuities offer longevity insurance.

There are two types of life annuities: fixed annuities and variable annuities. A fixed annuity pays a fixed nominal sum of money per period (usually each month), whereas a variable annuity pays a periodic amount linked to the investment performance of some underlying portfolio. Therefore, the investment risk of the underlying asset portfolio is borne by the recipient.

There are two stages in a variable annuity contract: an accumulation phase and a payout phase. During the accumulation phase, the investor contributes money periodically to one or more open-end mutual funds and accumulates shares. The second, or payout, stage usually starts at retirement, when the investor typically has several options, including the following:


1. Taking the market value of the shares in a lump-sum payment.
2. Receiving a fixed annuity until death.
3. Receiving a variable amount of money each period that depends on the investment performance of the portfolio.

Variable and Universal Life Insurance Variable life insurance is another tax-deferred investment vehicle offered by the life insurance industry. A variable life insurance policy combines life insurance with the tax-deferred annuities described earlier.

To invest in this product, you pay either a single premium or a series of premiums. In each case there is a stated death benefit, and the policyholder can allocate the money invested to several portfolios, which generally include a money market fund, a bond fund, and at least one common stock fund.

Variable life insurance policies offer a death benefit that is the greater of the stated face value or the market value of the investment base. In other words, the death benefit may rise with favorable investment performance, but it will not drop below the guaranteed face value.

The insured can gain access to the investment without having to pay income tax by borrowing against the cash surrender value. Policy loans of up to  $90\%$  of the cash value are available at any time at a contractually specified interest rate.

A universal life insurance policy is similar to a variable life policy except that, instead of having a choice of portfolios to invest in, the policyholder earns a rate of interest that is set by the insurance company and changed periodically as market conditions change. The disadvantage of universal life insurance is that the company sets the policyholder's rate of return, and, although companies may change the rate in response to competitive pressures, changes are not automatic.

# 28.7 Pension Funds

Pension plans are defined by the terms specifying the "who," "when," and "how much," for both the plan benefits and the plan contributions used to pay for those benefits. The pension fund of the plan is the cumulation of assets created from contributions and the investment earnings on those contributions, less any payments of benefits from the fund. In the U.S., contributions to the fund by either employer or employee are tax-deductible, and investment income of the fund is not taxed. Distributions from the fund, whether to the employer or the employee, are taxed as ordinary income. There are two "pure" types of pension plans: defined contribution and defined benefit.

# Defined Contribution Plans

In a defined contribution plan, a formula specifies contributions made by and on behalf of employees but does not promise the benefits to which they will be entitled. Contribution rules usually are specified as a predetermined fraction of salary (e.g., the employer contributes  $5\%$  of the employee's annual wages to the plan), although that fraction need not be constant over the course of an employee's career. The pension fund consists of a set of individual investment accounts, one for each employee. Pension benefits are not specified. The employee often has some choice over both the level of contributions and the way the account is invested.

Often, the employee can invest from a menu of mutual funds. The employee bears all the investment risk, and the employer has no legal obligation beyond making its periodic contributions.

A defined contribution plan is nearly identical to a tax-qualified individual retirement account. Indeed, the main providers of investment products for these plans are the same institutions such as mutual funds and insurance companies that serve the general investment needs of individuals. Therefore, in a defined contribution plan, much of the task of setting and achieving the income-replacement goal falls on the employee.

# Concept Check 28.3

An employee is 45 years old. Her salary is  \$60,000 per year, and she has\$ 100,000 accumulated in her self-directed defined contribution pension plan. Each year she contributes 5\% of her salary to the plan, and her employer matches it with another 5\%. She plans to retire at age 65.

Her retirement plan offers a choice of two funds: a guaranteed return fund that pays a risk-free real interest rate of  $3\%$  per year and a stock index fund that has an expected real rate of return of  $6\%$  per year and a standard deviation of  $20\%$ . Her current asset mix in the plan is  $\$50,000$  in the guaranteed fund and  $\$50,000$  in the stock index fund. She plans to reinvest all investment earnings in each fund in that same fund and to allocate her annual contribution equally between the two funds. If her salary grows at the same rate as the cost of living (so her real contributions to each fund will be constant), how much can she expect to have at retirement? How much can she be sure of having?

# Defined Benefit Plans

Whereas defined contribution plans specify the contributions made on behalf of employees, defined benefit plans specify the retirement benefits to which the employee is entitled. The firm is responsible for ensuring that funding will be adequate to provide those benefits. The benefit formula typically takes into account years of service for the employer and level of wages or salary (e.g., an employer might pay an employee for life, beginning at age 65, a yearly amount equal to  $2\%$  of final annual wage for each year of service). The employer (called the plan sponsor) or an insurance company hired by the sponsor guarantees the benefits and thus absorbs the investment risk.

As measured by the value of total pension liabilities, the defined benefit form still dominates in most countries around the world. However, the strong trend since the mid-1970s has been for sponsors, at least in the private sector, to choose the defined contribution form when starting new plans. But the two plan types are not mutually exclusive. Some sponsors adopt defined benefit plans as their primary plan, in which participation is mandatory, and supplement them with voluntary defined contribution plans.

With defined benefit plans, there is an important distinction between the pension plan and the pension fund. The plan is the contractual arrangement setting out the rights and obligations of all parties; the fund is a separate pool of assets set aside to provide collateral for the promised benefits. There may be no separate fund, in which case the plan is said to be unfunded. When there is a separate fund with assets worth less than the present value of the promised benefits, the plan is underfunded. And if the plan's assets have a market value that exceeds the present value of the plan's liabilities, it is said to be overfunded.

# Concept Check 28.4

An employee currently earning 60,000 a year is 40 years old and has been working for the firm for 15 years. The pension plan promises benefits in retirement of 2 \%of final salary times years of service. If normal retirement age is 65, the interest rate is 8 \%, and the employee’s life expectancy is 85, what is the present value of the accrued pension benefit?

# Pension Investment Strategies

The special tax status of pension funds creates the same incentive for both defined contribution and defined benefit plans to tilt their asset mix toward assets with the largest spread between pretax and after-tax rates of return. In a defined contribution plan, because the participant bears all the investment risk, the optimal asset mix also depends on the risk tolerance of the participant.

In defined benefit plans, optimal investment policy may be different because the sponsor absorbs the bulk of downside investment risk. If the sponsor has to share some of the upside potential of the pension assets with plan participants, there is an incentive to simply eliminate investment risk by investing in securities that match the promised benefits. If, for example, the plan sponsor has to pay  \$100 per year for the next five years, it can provide this stream of benefit payments by buying a set of five zero-coupon bonds each with a face value of\$ 100 and maturing sequentially. By so doing, the sponsor eliminates the risk of a shortfall. This is an example of immunization of the pension liability.

If the present value of promised pension benefits exceeds the market value of its assets, FASB Statement 87 requires that the corporation recognize the unfunded liability on its balance sheet. If, however, the pension assets exceed the present value of obligations, the corporation cannot include the surplus on its balance sheet. This asymmetric accounting treatment expresses a deeply held view about defined benefit pension funds. Representatives of organized labor, some politicians, and even some pension professionals believe that the sponsoring corporation, as guarantor of the accumulated pension benefits, is liable for pension asset shortfalls but does not have a clear right to the entire surplus in case of pension overfunding.

Investing in Equities If the only goal guiding corporate pension policy were shareholder wealth maximization, it is hard to understand why a financially sound pension sponsor would invest in equities at all. The tax advantage of a pension fund stems from the ability of the sponsor to earn the pretax interest rate on pension investments. To maximize the value of this tax shelter, it is necessary to invest entirely in assets offering the highest pretax interest rate. These will be the most tax disadvantaged assets, meaning that corporate pension funds should invest entirely in taxable bonds and other fixed-income investments.

Yet we know that, in general, pension funds invest from  $40\%$  to  $60\%$  of their portfolios in equity securities. Even a casual perusal of the practitioner literature suggests that they do so for a variety of reasons—some, but not all, legitimate. There are three possible correct reasons.

The first possibility is that corporate management views the pension plan as a trust for the employees and manages fund assets as if it were a defined contribution plan. It believes that a successful policy of investment in equities might allow it to pay extra benefits to employees and is therefore worth taking the risk.

The second possible correct reason is that management believes that through superior market timing and security selection, it is possible to create value in excess of management fees and expenses. Note that a very weak form of the efficient markets hypothesis would imply that management cannot create shareholder value simply by shifting the pension portfolio out of bonds and into stocks. Even when the entire pension surplus belongs to the shareholders, investing in stocks just moves the shareholders along the capital market line (the market trade-off between risk and return for passive investors) and does not create value. This implies that it makes sense for a pension fund to invest in equities only if it is able to pursue an active strategy that beats the market through either superior timing or security selection. A completely passive strategy will add no value to shareholders.

For an underfunded plan of a corporation in financial distress, there is another possible reason for investing in stocks and other risky assets—federal pension insurance. Firms in financial distress have an incentive to invest pension fund money in the riskiest assets. They may reason that if the invested assets do well and the firm recovers, it captures the benefit, but if the investment does poorly and the corporation becomes insolvent, the federal insurance program inherits the losses.

An incorrect, but common justification for a pension fund to invest in equities is that the expected rate of return on the pension-fund asset portfolio is often (albeit inappropriately) used to obtain the discount rate applied to find the present value of pension liabilities. By investing in higher risk-higher expected return securities, the discount rate is increased, which produces a lower present value of liabilities, and thus a rosier view of pension funding. But this reasoning is surely incorrect. The appropriate discount rate of the pension obligations depends on their risk, not the assets held to fund them. The asset composition of the pension fund should not be allowed to affect the assessment of the funding status of the plan.

# SUMMARY

1. When the principles of portfolio management are discussed, it is useful to distinguish among eight classes of investors:

$a$  Individual investors.
b. Personal trusts.
c. Mutual funds.
$d$  . Pension funds.
e. Endowment funds.
$f$ . Life insurance companies.
g. Non-life insurance companies.
h. Banks.

In general, these groups have somewhat different investment objectives, constraints, and portfolio policies.

2. To some extent, most institutional investors seek to match the risk-and-return characteristics of their investment portfolios to the characteristics of their liabilities.
3. The process of asset allocation includes the following steps:

$a$  . Specifying the asset classes to be included.
b. Defining capital market expectations.
c. Specifying the investor's objectives and constraints.
d. Determining the asset allocation that gives the best risk-return trade-off consistent with the investor's particular circumstances.

4. For investors who must pay taxes on their investment income, the process of asset allocation is complicated by the fact that they pay income taxes only on certain kinds of investment income. Interest income on munis is exempt from tax, and high-tax-bracket investors will prefer to hold them rather than short- and long-term taxable bonds. The more complex aspect of taxes is the fact that capital gains are taxable only if realized through the sale of an asset during the holding period.

5. The life-cycle approach to the management of an individual's investment portfolio views the individual as passing through a series of stages, becoming more risk averse in later years. The rationale underlying this approach is that as we age, we use up our human capital and have less time remaining to recoup possible portfolio losses through increased labor supply.

6. There are three ways to shelter investment income from federal income taxes besides investing in tax-exempt bonds: The first is by investing in assets whose returns take the form of appreciation in value, such as common stocks or real estate. As long as capital gains taxes are not paid until the asset is sold, the tax can be deferred indefinitely. The second is through investing in tax-deferred retirement plans such as IRAs. The third is to invest in the tax-advantaged products offered by the life insurance industry—tax-deferred annuities and variable and universal life insurance. They combine the flexibility of mutual fund investing with the tax advantages of tax deferral.
7. When allocating investment funds between tax-protected and other accounts, investors will minimize their overall tax burden by holding the least tax-advantaged asset (e.g., bonds) in their tax-protected accounts [e.g., IRAs or 401(k) plans]. The general investment rule is to hold the least tax-advantaged assets in the tax-protected plan and the most tax-advantaged assets outside of it.
8. Pension plans are either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. Defined contribution plans are in effect retirement funds held in trust for the employee by the employer. The employees in such plans bear all the risk of the plan's assets and often have some choice in the allocation of those assets. Defined benefit plans give the employees a claim to a money-fixed annuity at retirement. The annuity level is determined by a formula that takes into account years of service and the employee's wage or salary history.

1. Angus Walker, CFA, is reviewing the defined benefit pension plan of Acme Industries. Based in London, Acme has operations in North America, Japan, and several European countries. Next month, the retirement age for full benefits under the plan will be lowered from age 60 to age 55.

The median age of Acme's workforce is 49 years. Walker is responsible for the pension plan's investment policy and strategic asset allocation decisions. The goals of the plan include achieving a minimum expected return of  $8.4\%$  with expected standard deviation no greater than  $16.0\%$ .

Walker is evaluating the current asset allocation (Table 28A) and selected financial information for the company (Table 28B). There is an ongoing debate within Acme Industries about the pension plan's investment policy statement (IPS). Two investment policy statements under consideration are shown in Table 28C.

5. Jarvis University (JU) is a private, multiprogram U.S. university with a  \$2 billion endowment fund as of fiscal year-end May 31, 2030. With little government support, JU is heavily dependent on its endowment fund to support ongoing expenditures, especially because the university's enrollment growth and tuition revenue have not met expectations in recent years. The endowment fund must make a\$ 126 million annual contribution, which is indexed to inflation, to JU's general operating budget. The U.S. Consumer Price Index is expected to rise 2.5\% annually and the U.S. higher education cost index is anticipated to rise 3\% annually. The endowment has also budgeted 200 million due on January 31, 2031, representing the final payment for construction of a new main library.

In a recent capital campaign, JU only met its fund-raising goal with the help of one very successful alumna, Valerie Bremner, who donated \$400 million of Bertocchi Oil and Gas common stock at fiscal year-end May 31, 2030. Bertocchi Oil and Gas is a large-capitalization, publicly traded U.S. company. Bremner donated the stock on the condition that no more than  $25\%$  of the initial number of shares may be sold in any fiscal year. No substantial additional donations are expected in the future.

Given the large contribution to and distributions from the endowment fund, the endowment fund's investment committee has decided to revise the fund's investment policy statement. The investment committee also recognizes that a revised asset allocation may be warranted. The asset allocation in place for the JU endowment fund as of May 31, 2030, is given in Table 28E.

$a$ . Prepare the components of an appropriate investment policy statement for the Jarvis University endowment fund as of June 1, 2030, based only on the information given.

Note: Each component in your response must specifically address circumstances of the JU endowment fund.

b. Determine the most appropriate revised allocation percentage for each asset in Table 28E as of June 1, 2030. Justify each revised allocation percentage.

6. Susan Fairfax is president of Reston Industries, a U.S.-based company whose sales are entirely domestic and whose shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The following are additional facts concerning her current situation:

- Fairfax is single, aged 58. She has no immediate family, has no debts, and does not own a residence. She is in excellent health and covered by Reston-paid health insurance that continues after her expected retirement at age 65.
- Her base salary of 500,000/year, inflation-protected, is sufficient to support her present lifestyle but can no longer generate any excess for savings.
- She has 2,000,000 of savings from prior years held in the form of short-term instruments.
- Reston rewards key employees through a generous stock-bonus incentive plan but provides no pension plan and pays no dividend.
- Fairfax's incentive plan participation has resulted in her ownership of Reston stock worth 10 million (current market value). The stock, received tax-free but subject to tax at a 35\% rate (on entire proceeds) if sold, is expected to be held at least until her retirement.
- Her present level of spending and the current annual inflation rate of  $4\%$  are expected to continue after her retirement.
- Fairfax is taxed at  $35\%$  on all salary, investment income, and realized capital gains. Assume her composite tax rate will continue at this level indefinitely.

Fairfax's orientation is patient, careful, and conservative in all things. She has stated that an annual after-tax real total return of  $3\%$  would be completely acceptable to her if it was achieved in a context where an investment portfolio created from her accumulated savings was not subject to a decline of more than  $10\%$  in nominal terms in any given 12-month period. To obtain the benefits of professional assistance, she has approached two investment advisory firms—HH Counselors (HH) and Coastal Advisors (Coastal)—for recommendations on allocation of the investment portfolio to be created from her existing savings assets (the Savings Portfolio) as well as for advice concerning investing in general.

a. Create and justify an investment policy statement for Fairfax based only on the information provided thus far. Be specific and complete in presenting objectives and constraints. (An asset allocation is not required in answering this question.) b. Coastal has proposed the asset allocation shown in Table 28F for investment of Fairfax's 2 million of savings assets. Assume that only the current yield portion of projected total return (comprised of both investment income and realized capital gains) is taxable to Fairfax and that the municipal bond income is entirely tax-exempt.

Critique the Coastal proposal. Include in your answer three weaknesses in the Coastal proposal from the standpoint of the investment policy statement you created for her in part  $(a)$ .

Susan Fairfax proposed asset allocation, prepared by Coastal Advisors c. HH Counselors has developed five alternative asset allocations (shown in Table 28G) for client portfolios. Answer the following questions based on Table 28G and the investment policy statement you created for Fairfax in part  $(a)$ .


i. Determine which of the asset allocations in Table 28G meet or exceed Fairfax's stated return objective.
ii. Determine the three asset allocations in Table 28G that meet Fairfax's risk tolerance criterion. Assume a  $95\%$  confidence interval is required, with 2 standard deviations serving as an approximation of that requirement.

$d$ . Assume that the risk-free rate is  $4.5\%$ .

i. Calculate the Sharpe ratio for Asset Allocation D in Table 28G.
ii. Determine the two asset allocations in Table 28G having the best risk-adjusted returns, based only on the Sharpe ratio measure.

e. Recommend and justify the one asset allocation in Table 28G you believe would be the best model for Fairfax's savings portfolio.

7. John Franklin is a recent widower with some experience in investing for his own account. Following his wife's recent death and settlement of the estate, Mr. Franklin owns a controlling interest in a successful privately held manufacturing company in which Mrs. Franklin was formerly active, a recently completed warehouse property, the family residence, and his personal holdings of stocks and bonds. He has decided to retain the warehouse property as a diversifying investment but intends to sell the private company interest, giving half of the proceeds to a medical research foundation in memory of his deceased wife. Actual transfer of this gift is expected to take place about three months from now. You have been engaged to assist him with the valuations, planning, and portfolio building required to structure his investment program appropriately.

Mr. Franklin has introduced you to the finance committee of the medical research foundation that is to receive his 45 million cash gift three months hence (and will eventually receive

Table 28G

Alternative asset allocations, prepared by HH Counselors the assets of his estate). This gift will greatly increase the size of the foundation's endowment (from  \$10 million to\$ 55 million) as well as enable it to make larger grants to researchers. The foundation's grant-making (spending) policy has been to pay out virtually all of its annual net investment income. As its investment approach has been very conservative, the endowment portfolio now consists almost entirely of fixed-income assets. The finance committee understands that these actions are causing the real value of foundation assets and the real value of future grants to decline due to the effects of inflation. Until now, the finance committee has believed that it had no alternative to these actions, given the large immediate cash needs of the research programs being funded and the small size of the foundation's capital base. The foundation's annual grants must at least equal 5\% of its assets' market value to maintain its U.S. tax-exempt status, a requirement that is expected to continue indefinitely. No additional gifts or fund-raising activities are expected over the foreseeable future.


Given the change in circumstances that Mr. Franklin's gift will make, the finance committee wishes to develop new grant-making and investment policies. Annual spending must at least meet the level of  $5\%$  of market value that is required to maintain the foundation's tax-exempt status, but the committee is unsure about how much higher than  $5\%$  it can or should be. The committee wants to pay out as much as possible because of the critical nature of the research being funded; however, it understands that preserving the real value of the foundation's assets is equally important in order to preserve its future grant-making capabilities. You have been asked to assist the committee in developing appropriate policies.

a. Identify and briefly discuss the three key elements that should determine the foundation's grant-making (spending) policy.
b. Formulate and justify an investment policy statement for the foundation, taking into account the increased size of its assets arising from Mr. Franklin's gift. Your policy statement must encompass all relevant objectives, constraints, and the key elements identified in your answer to part (a).
c. Recommend and justify a long-term asset allocation that is consistent with the investment policy statement you created in part (b). Explain how your allocation's expected return meets the requirements of a feasible grant-making (spending) policy for the foundation. (Hint: Your allocation must sum to  $100\%$  and should use the economic/market data presented in Table 28H and your knowledge of historical asset-class characteristics.)

8. Christopher Maclin, aged 40, is a supervisor at Barnett Co. and earns an annual salary of £80,000 before taxes. Louise Maclin, aged 38, stays home to care for their newborn twins. She recently inherited £900,000 (after wealth-transfer taxes) in cash from her father's estate. In addition, the Maclins have accumulated the following assets (current market value):

£5,000 in cash.
£160,000 in stocks and bonds.
£220,000 in Barnett common stock.

Capital markets annualized return data

The value of their holdings in Barnett stock has appreciated substantially as a result of the company's growth in sales and profits during the past 10 years. Christopher Maclin is confident that the company and its stock will continue to perform well.

The Maclins need £30,000 for a down payment on the purchase of a house and plan to make a £20,000 non-tax-deductible donation to a local charity in memory of Louise Maclin's father. The Maclins' annual living expenses are £74,000. After-tax salary increases will offset any future increases in their living expenses.

During their discussions with their financial advisor, Grant Webb, the Maclins express concern about achieving their educational goals for their children and their own retirement goals. The Maclins tell Webb:

- They want to have sufficient funds to retire in 18 years when their children begin their four years of university education.
- They have been unhappy with the portfolio volatility they have experienced in recent years and they do not want to experience a loss greater than  $12\%$  in any one year.
- They do not want to invest in alcohol and tobacco stocks.
- They will not have any additional children.

After their discussions, Webb calculates that in 18 years the Maclins will need £2 million to meet their educational and retirement goals. Webb suggests that their portfolio be structured to limit shortfall risk (defined as expected total return minus two standard deviations) to no lower than a  $-12\%$  return in any one year. Maclin's salary and all capital gains and investment income are taxed at  $40\%$  and no tax-sheltering strategies are available. Webb's next step is to formulate an investment policy statement for the Maclins.

$a$ . Formulate the risk objective of an investment policy statement for the Maclins.
$b$ . Formulate the return objective of an investment policy statement for the Maclins. Calculate the pretax rate of return that is required to achieve this objective. Show your calculations.
c. Formulate the constraints portion of an investment policy statement for the Maclins, addressing each of the following: i. Time horizon

ii. Liquidity requirements iii. Tax concerns
iv. Unique circumstances

9. Louise and Christopher Maclin (see Problem 8) have purchased their house and made the donation to the local charity. Now that an investment policy statement has been prepared for the Maclins, Grant Webb recommends that they consider the strategic asset allocation described in Table 28I.

<table><tr><td>Asset Class</td><td>Recommended Allocation</td><td>Current Yield</td><td>Projected Annualized Pretax Total Return</td><td>Expected Standard Deviation</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>15.0\%</td><td>1.0\%</td><td>1.0\%</td><td>2.5\%</td></tr><tr><td>U.K. corporate bonds</td><td>55.0</td><td>4.0</td><td>5.0</td><td>11.0</td></tr><tr><td>U.K. small-capitalization equities</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>11.0</td><td>25.0</td></tr><tr><td>U.K. large-capitalization equities</td><td>10.0</td><td>2.0</td><td>9.0</td><td>21.0</td></tr><tr><td>U.S. equities*</td><td>5.0</td><td>1.5</td><td>10.0</td><td>20.0</td></tr><tr><td>Barnett Co. common stock</td><td>15.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>16.0</td><td>48.0</td></tr><tr><td>Total portfolio</td><td>100.0</td><td>—</td><td>6.7</td><td>12.4</td></tr></table>

Louise and Christopher Maclin's asset class ranges a. Identify aspects of the recommended asset allocation in Table 28I that are inconsistent with the Maclins' investment objectives and constraints. Support your responses.

b. After further discussion, Webb and the Maclins agree that any suitable strategic asset allocation will include  $5 - 10\%$  in U.K. small-capitalization equities and  $10 - 15\%$  in U.K. large-capitalization equities. For the remainder of the portfolio, Webb is considering the asset class ranges described in Table 28J.

Recommend the most appropriate allocation range for each of the asset classes in Table 28J. Justify each appropriate allocation range with a reason based on the Maclins' investment objectives and constraints.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. Identify the elements that are life cycle-driven in the two schemes of objectives and constraints.
2. If the investor keeps her present asset allocation, she will have the following amounts to spend after taxes five years from now:

Tax-qualified account:

$$
\text {B o n d s :} \\ 5 0, 0 0 0 (1. 1 0) ^ {5} \times . 7 2 = \\ 5 7, 9 7 8. 3 6
$$

$$
\text {S t o c k s :} \\ 5 0, 0 0 0 (1. 1 5) ^ {5} \times . 7 2 = \\ 7 2, 4 0 8. 8 6
$$

$$
\text {S u b t o t a l} \quad \$ 1 3 0, 3 8 7. 2 2
$$

Nonretirement account:

$$
\text {B o n d s :} \\ 5 0, 0 0 0 [ 1 + (. 1 0 \times . 7 2) ] ^ {5} = \\ 7 0, 7 8 5. 4 4
$$

$$
\text {S t o c k s :} \\ \underline {{\$ 5 0 , 0 0 0 (1 . 1 5) ^ {5} - . 1 5 \times [ 5 0 , 0 0 0 (1 . 1 5) ^ {5} - 5 0 , 0 0 0 ]}} = \underline {{\$ 9 2 , 9 8 2 . 6 8}}
$$

$$
\text {S u b t o t a l} \quad \$ 1 6 3, 7 6 8. 1 2
$$

$$
\text {T o t a l} \quad \$ 2 9 4, 1 5 5. 3 4
$$

If she shifts all of the bonds into the retirement account and all of the stock into the nonretirement account, she will have the following amounts to spend after taxes five years from now:

Tax-qualified account:

$$
\text {B o n d s :} \\ 1 0 0, 0 0 0 (1. 1 0) ^ {5} \times . 7 2 = \\ 1 1 5, 9 5 6. 7 2
$$

Nonretirement account:

$$
\text {S t o c k s :} \\ \mathbb {1 0 0 , 0 0 0 (1 . 1 5) ^ {5}} -. 1 5 \times [ 1 0 0, 0 0 0 (1. 1 5) ^ {5} - 1 0 0, 0 0 0 ] = \mathbb {1 8 5 , 9 6 5 . 3 6}
$$

$$
\text {T o t a l} = \$ 3 0 1, 9 2 2. 0 8
$$

Her final accumulation will increase by 7,766.74.

3. The total contribution to each fund (stock and guaranteed return fund) will be \$3,000 per year (i.e., 5\% of \$60,000) in constant dollars. At retirement she will have in her guaranteed return fund:

$$
\$ 50,000 \times 1.03 ^ {20} + \$ 3,000 \times \text {Future value annuity factor} (3 \%, 20 \text {years}) = \$ 170,917
$$

That is the amount she will have for sure because the value of her stock investment can, at least in principle, fall to zero.

In addition, the expected future value of her stock account is:

$$
\$ 50,000 \times 1.06 ^ {20} + \$ 3,000 \times \text {Future value annuity factor} (6 \%, 20 \text {years}) = \$ 270,714
$$

4. He has accrued an annuity of .02 × 15 × 60,000 = \$18,000 per year that is expected to begin in 25 years (at age 65) and to last for 20 years (from age 65 to 85). The present value of this annuity is \$25,805:

$$
\mathrm {PV} = \\mathbb {S} 18,000 \times \text {Annuity factor} (8 \% , 20) \times \mathrm {PV} \text {factor} (8 \% , 25) = \\mathbb {S} 25,805
$$

$T_{p}$  Treynor's measure for a portfolio, excess expected return divided by beta

V Intrinsic value of a firm, the present value of future dividends per share

$X$  Exercise price of an option

Yield to maturity

$\alpha$  Rate of return beyond the value that would be forecast from the market's return and the systematic risk of the security

$\pmb{\beta}$  Systematic or market risk of a security

$\pmb{\rho}_{ij}$  Correlation coefficient between returns on securities  $i$  and  $j$

Standard deviation

$\sigma^2$  Variance

# Measures of Risk

Variance of returns:  $\sigma^2 = \sum_s p(s)[r(s) - E(r)]^2$

Standard deviation:  $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$

Covariance between returns:  $\operatorname{Cov}(r_i, r_j) = \sum_s p(s) [r_i(s) - E(r_i)] [r_j(s) - E(r_j)]$

Beta of security  $i\colon \beta_{i} = \frac{\operatorname{Cov}(r_{i},r_{M})}{\operatorname{Var}(r_{M})}$

# Portfolio Theory

Expected rate of return on a portfolio with weights  $w_{i}$  in each security:  $E(r_{p}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_{i}E(r_{i})$

Variance of portfolio rate of return:  $\sigma_p^2 = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_j w_i \operatorname{Cov}(r_i, r_j)$

# Market Equilibrium

The CAPM security market line:  $E(r_{i}) = r_{f} + \beta_{i}[E(r_{M}) - r_{f}]$

Multifactor security market line (in excess returns):  $E(R_{i}) = \beta_{iM}E(R_{M}) + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\beta_{ik}E(R_{k})$

# Fixed-Income Analysis

Present value of 1:

Discrete period compounding:  $\mathrm{PV} = 1 / (1 + r)^T$

Continuous compounding:  $\mathrm{PV} = e^{-r_{\mathrm{cc}}T}$

Forward rate of interest for period  $T$ :  $f_{T} = \frac{(1 + y_{T})^{T}}{(1 + y_{T - 1})^{T - 1}} - 1$

Real interest rate:  $r_{\mathrm{real}} = \frac{1 + r_{\mathrm{nom}}}{1 + i} - 1$ where  $r_{\mathrm{nom}}$  is the nominal interest rate and  $i$  is the inflation rate


Duration of a security:  $D = \sum_{t=1}^{T} t \times \frac{CF_t}{(1 + y)^t} / \text{Price}$

Modified duration:  $D^{*} = D / (1 + y)$

# Equity Analysis

Constant growth dividend discount model:  $V_{0} = \frac{D_{1}}{k - g}$

Sustainable growth rate of dividends:  $g = \mathrm{ROE} \times b$

Price/earnings multiple:  $P / E = \frac{1 - b}{k - \mathrm{ROE} \times b}$

$$
\mathrm {R O E} = (1 - \text {T a x r a t e}) \left[ \mathrm {R O A} + (\mathrm {R O A} - \text {I n t e r s t r a t e}) \frac {\text {D e b t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} \right]
$$

# Derivative Assets

Put-call parity:  $P = C - S_{0} + \mathrm{PV}(X + \mathrm{dividends})$

Black-Scholes formula (with constant dividend yield):  $C = Se^{-\delta T}N(d_1) - Xe^{-rT}N(d_2)$

$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (S / X) + (r - \delta + \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}
$$

$$ d _ {2} = d _ {1} - \sigma \sqrt {T}
$$

Spot-futures parity:  $F_{0} = S_{0}(1 + r - d)^{T}$

Interest rate parity (direct exchange rate quotes):  $F_{0} = E_{0}\left(\frac{1 + r_{\mathrm{US}}}{1 + r_{\mathrm{foreign}}}\right)^{T}$

# Performance Evaluation

Sharpe ratio:  $S_{p} = \frac{\overline{r}_{p} - \overline{r}_{f}}{\sigma_{p}}$

Treynor's measure:  $T_{p} = \frac{\overline{r}_{p} - \overline{r}_{f}}{\beta_{p}}$

Jensen's alpha:  $\alpha_{p} = \overline{r}_{p} - [\overline{r}_{f} + \beta_{p}(\overline{r}_{M} - \overline{r}_{f})]$

Information ratio:  $\frac{\alpha_p}{\sigma(e_p)}$

Geometric average return:  $r_{G} = \left[(1 + r_{1})(1 + r_{2})\dots (1 + r_{T})\right]^{1 / T} - 1$
