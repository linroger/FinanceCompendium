# Asset Classes and Financial Instruments

# 2

YOU LEARNED IN Chapter 1 that the process of building an investment portfolio usually begins by deciding how much money to allocate to broad classes of assets, such as safe money market securities or bank accounts, longer term bonds, stocks, or even asset classes like real estate or precious metals. This process is called asset allocation. Within each class the investor then selects specific assets from a more detailed menu. This is called security selection.

Each broad asset class contains many specific security types, and the many variations on a theme can be overwhelming. Our goal in this chapter is to introduce you to the important features of broad classes of securities. Toward this end, we organize our tour of financial instruments according to asset class.

Financial markets are traditionally segmented into money markets and capital markets. Money market instruments include short-term, marketable, liquid, low-risk debt securities. Money market instruments sometimes are called cash equivalents, or just cash for short. Capital markets, in contrast, include longer term and riskier securities. Securities in the capital market are much more diverse than those found within the money market. For this reason, we will subdivide the capital market into four segments: longer term bond markets, equity markets, and the derivative markets for options and futures.


We first describe money market instruments. We then move on to debt and equity securities. We explain the structure of various stock market indexes in this chapter because market benchmark portfolios play an important role in portfolio construction and evaluation. Finally, we survey the derivative security markets for options, futures, and swap contracts.

# 2.1 The Money Market

The money market consists of very short-term, highly marketable debt securities. Many of these securities trade in large denominations and so are out of the reach of individual investors. Money market funds, however, are easily accessible to small investors.

# Treasury Bills

U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills, or just bills, for short) are the most marketable of all money market instruments. The government borrows money by selling bills to the public. Investors buy the bills at a discount from the stated maturity (equivalently, face) value. At maturity, the government pays the investor the face value of the bill. The difference between the purchase price and ultimate maturity value constitutes the interest paid on the bills.

T-bills are issued with initial maturities of 4, 13, 26, or 52 weeks. Individuals can purchase them directly, at auction, or on the secondary market from a government securities dealer. T-bills are highly liquid; that is, they are easily converted to cash and sold at low transaction cost and with minimal price risk. Unlike most other money market instruments, which sell in minimum denominations of  \$100,000, T-bills sell in minimum denominations of only\$ 100, although 10,000 denominations are far more common. Earnings on T-bills are exempt from state and local taxes, another characteristic distinguishing them from other money market instruments.

Figure 2.1 is a partial listing of T-bill rates. Rather than providing prices of each bill, the financial press reports yields based on those prices. You will see yields corresponding to both bid and ask prices. The ask price is the price you would have to pay to buy a T-bill from a securities dealer. The bid price is the slightly lower price you would receive if you wanted to sell a bill to a dealer. The bid-ask spread is the difference in these prices, which is the dealer's source of profit.

The first two yields in Figure 2.1 are reported using the bank-discount method. This means that the bill's discount from its maturity or face value is "annualized" based on a 360-day year, and then reported as a percentage of face value. For example, for the highlighted bill maturing on November 18, 2021, there are 127 days to maturity, and the yield under the column labeled "ASKED" is given as .045\%. This means that a dealer was willing to sell the bill at a discount from face value of .045\% × (127/360) = .0159\%. So a bill with \$10,000 face value could be purchased for \$10,000 × (1 - .000159) = 9,998.41. To summarize, the price of the bill as a fraction of face value is

$$
\text {A s k p r i c e} = 1 - \text {A S K E D} \times \frac {\text {D a y s u n t i l m a t u r i t y}}{3 6 0}
$$ where the ASKED yield is expressed as a decimal (not as a percent). Similarly, with a BID yield of .055\%, a dealer would be willing to purchase the bill for  $10,000 \times (1 - .00055 \times 127 / 360) = \$ 9,998.06. $Notice that because prices and yields are inversely related, the higher bid yield reported in Figure 2.1 implies a lower bid price.$

The bank discount method for computing yields has a long tradition, but it is flawed for at least two reasons. First, it assumes that the year has only 360 days. Second, it computes the yield as a fraction of par value rather than of the price the investor paid to acquire the bill. An investor who buys the bill for the ask price and holds it until maturity will see that investment grow over 127 days by a multiple of 10,000 / \9,998.41 = 1.000159, for a gain of .0159\%. Annualizing this gain using a 365-day year results in a yield of .0159\% \times 365/127 = .0457\%, which aside from minor rounding error, is the value reported in the last column under "ASKED YIELD." This last value is called the Treasury-bill's bond-equivalent yield.

# Certificates of Deposit

A certificate of deposit, or CD, is a time deposit with a bank. Time deposits (in contrast to "demand deposits" or checking accounts) may not be withdrawn on demand. The bank pays interest and principal to the depositor only at maturity. CDs issued in denominations greater than  \$100,000 are usually negotiable, however; that is, they can be sold to another investor if the owner needs to cash in the certificate before it matures. Short-term CDs are highly marketable, although the market significantly thins out for maturities of three months or more. CDs are treated as bank deposits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, so they are insured for up to\$ 250,000 in the event of a bank insolvency.

# Commercial Paper

Large, well-known companies often issue their own short-term unsecured debt notes rather than borrow directly from banks. These notes are called commercial paper. Very often, commercial paper is backed by a bank line of credit, which gives the borrower access to cash that can be used (if needed) to pay off the paper at maturity.

Commercial paper maturities range up to 270 days, but most often, it is issued with a maturity of less than one or two months, usually in multiples of 100,000. Therefore, small investors can invest in commercial paper only indirectly, via money market mutual funds.

Commercial paper is considered to be a fairly safe asset because a firm's condition presumably can be monitored and predicted over a term as short as one month.

While most commercial paper is issued by nonfinancial firms, in the years leading up to the financial crisis, there was a sharp increase in asset-backed commercial paper issued by financial firms such as banks. This was short-term commercial paper typically used to raise funds for the issuing firm to invest in other assets, most notoriously, subprime mortgages. These assets were in turn used as collateral for the commercial paper—hence the label "asset backed." This practice led to many difficulties starting in the summer of 2007 when the subprime mortgagors began defaulting. The banks found themselves unable to issue new commercial paper to refinance their positions as the old paper matured.

# Bankers' Acceptances

A banker's acceptance starts as an order to a bank by a bank's customer to pay a sum of money at a future date, typically within six months. At this stage, it is similar to a post-dated check. When the bank endorses the order for payment as "accepted," it assumes responsibility for ultimate payment to the holder of the acceptance. At this point, the acceptance may be traded in secondary markets like any other claim on the bank. Bankers' acceptances are considered very safe because traders can substitute the bank's credit standing for their own. They are used widely in foreign trade where the creditworthiness of one trader is unknown to the trading partner. Acceptances sell at a discount from the face value of the payment order, just as T-bills sell at a discount from face value.


# Eurodollars

Eurodollars are dollar-denominated deposits at foreign banks or foreign branches of American banks. By locating outside the United States, these banks escape regulation by the Federal Reserve. Despite the tag “Euro,” these accounts need not be in European banks, although that is where the practice of accepting dollar-denominated deposits outside the United States began.

Most Eurodollar deposits are for large sums, and most are time deposits of less than six months' maturity. A Eurodollar certificate of deposit resembles a domestic bank CD except that it is the liability of a non-U.S. branch of a bank. Firms also issue Eurodollar bonds, which are dollar-denominated bonds outside the United States, although bonds are not considered part of the money market because of their long maturities.

# Repos and Reverses

Dealers in government securities use repurchase agreements, also called "repos" or "RPs," as a form of short-term, usually overnight, borrowing. The dealer sells government securities to an investor on an overnight basis, with an agreement to buy back those securities the next day at a slightly higher price. The increase in the price is the overnight interest. The dealer thus takes out a one-day loan from the investor, and the securities serve as collateral.

A term repo is essentially an identical transaction, except that the term of the implicit loan can be 30 days or more. Repos are considered very safe in terms of credit risk because the loans are backed by the government securities. A reverse repo is the mirror image of a repo. Here, the dealer finds an investor holding government securities and buys them, agreeing to sell them back at a specified higher price on a future date.

# Federal Funds

Just as most of us maintain deposits at banks, banks maintain deposits of their own at a Federal Reserve bank. Each member bank of the Federal Reserve System, or "the Fed," is required to maintain a minimum balance in a reserve account with the Fed. The required balance depends on the total deposits of the bank's customers. Funds in the bank's reserve account are called federal funds, or fed funds. At any time, some banks have more funds than required at the Fed. Other banks, primarily big banks in New York and other financial centers, tend to have a shortage. Banks with excess funds lend to those with a shortage. These loans, which are usually overnight transactions, are arranged at a rate of interest called the federal funds rate.

Although the fed funds market arose primarily as a way for banks to transfer balances to meet reserve requirements, today the market has evolved to the point that many large banks use federal funds in a straightforward way as one component of their total sources of funding. Therefore, the fed funds rate is simply the rate of interest on very-short-term loans among banks. While most investors cannot participate in this market, the fed funds rate commands great interest as a key barometer of monetary policy.

# Brokers' Calls

Individuals who buy stocks on margin borrow part of the funds to pay for the stocks from their broker. The broker in turn may borrow the funds from a bank, agreeing to repay the bank immediately (on call) if the bank requests it. The rate paid on such loans is usually about  $1\%$  higher than the rate on short-term T-bills.

# LIBOR and Its Replacements

The London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) was, until 2021, the premier short-term interest rate quoted in the European money market and served as a reference rate for a wide range of financial contracts. For example, a corporation or homeowner might have borrowed at a rate equal to LIBOR plus two percentage points. Hundreds of trillions of dollars of loans, mortgages, and derivative contracts were tied to it.

LIBOR and similar rates called Euribor (European interbank offer rate) and Tibor (Tokyo interbank offer rate) were quoted in several major currencies (e.g., the U.S. dollar, the British pound, the yen, the euro). However, they were all based on surveys of rates reported by participating banks. When a major scandal surrounding those surveys hit the LIBOR market in 2012 (see the "End of LIBOR" box), the search for a replacement was on.

One of the problems with LIBOR and its related rates was that they did not reflect actual transactions between disinterested parties with money at stake. Banks faced no real cost if they provided inaccurate answers to the rate surveys. In contrast, the replacements are overnight interest rates at which borrowing and lending actually takes place. In the United States, LIBOR is giving way to SOFR, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, which is the rate on overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by Treasury securities.

Because SOFR is the rate on a well-collateralized loan, it embodies essentially no premium for credit risk. In contrast, LIBOR rates could increase dramatically when bank risk was perceived to be higher, for example in 2008 during the financial crisis. In this sense, SOFR is a "cleaner" indicator of the pure time value of money than LIBOR was.

As noted in the "End of LIBOR" box, reference rates across the world are being replaced by rates paid on actual overnight transactions. Unlike SOFR, the rates used outside the United States are generally for unsecured transactions, but as a very short-term loan among high-rated banks, they entail minimal credit risk.

One issue with these new benchmarks is the very short-term (overnight) period of the loans they measure. LIBOR had been quoted for loans with terms ranging from overnight to several months. The longer term versions of these replacement rates require some sort of averaging of these daily rates. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York now publishes SOFR averages for periods of 30, 90, and 180 days over the period ending on a particular date.

LIBOR was supposed to be fully phased out by 2021. However, the phase-out schedule has slipped a bit. While the Federal Reserve has directed banks to stop writing new contracts using LIBOR, existing contracts may remain in force until June 2023.

# Yields on Money Market Instruments

Although most money market securities are low risk, they are not risk-free. The securities of the money market promise yields greater than those on default-free T-bills, at least in part because of their greater risk. In addition, many investors require more liquidity; thus, they will accept lower yields on securities such as T-bills that can be quickly and cheaply sold for cash. Figure 2.2 shows that federal funds, for example, consistently have offered a yield premium over T-bills. Moreover, that premium increased with economic crises such as the energy price shocks associated with the two OPEC disturbances, the stock market crash in 1987, the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998, and the financial

LIBOR was designed initially as a survey of interbank lending rates but soon became a key determinant of short-term interest rates with far-reaching significance. More than 500 trillion of derivative contracts as well as trillions of dollars of loans and bonds with floating interest rates were linked to it

However, LIBOR was not a rate at which actual transactions occurred; instead, it was just a survey of "estimated" borrowing rates, and that made it vulnerable to tampering. Several large banks were asked to submit the rate at which they claimed to believe they could borrow in the interbank market.

In 2012, it emerged that several participating banks were colluding by shading their LIBOR submissions to enhance profits on derivatives trades. Traders used e-mails and instant messages to tell each other whether they wanted to see higher or lower submissions. Members of this informal cartel essentially set up a "favor bank" to help each other move the survey average up or down depending on their trading positions. More than 6 billion of fines were paid by the participating banks.


LIBOR is being replaced by interest rates on actual interbank loans: SOFR in the United States and SONIA (Sterling Overnight Index Average) in the United Kingdom. Similar survey rates elsewhere are also due to be replaced. For example, Tibor, the Japanese yen interbank rate, is giving way to TONA (the Tokyo overnight average rate). Euro-denominated contracts will replace Euribor with ESTER (Euro short-term rate, also called €STER).

crisis of 2008-2009. If you look back to Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1, you'll see that the TED spread, the difference between the LIBOR rate and Treasury bills, also peaked during periods of financial stress as well as during the COVID crisis of 2020.

# Money Market Funds

Money market funds are mutual funds that invest in money market instruments. They are a major conduit for the funds invested in the money market: In mid-2022, the total assets managed by these funds amounted to about 4.5 trillion. While money market funds usually pose extremely low risk to investors, the financial crisis constituted a traumatic shock to these markets. The nearby box discusses the fallout of the crisis.

# Money Market Funds and the Financial Crisis

Money market funds are mutual funds that invest in the short-term debt instruments that comprise the money market. They are required to hold only short-maturity debt of the highest quality: The average maturity of their holdings must be maintained at less than 3 months. Because of this very conservative investment profile, money market funds typically experience extremely low price risk. Investors for their part usually acquire check-writing privileges with their funds and often use them as a close substitute for a bank account. This is feasible because the funds almost always maintain share value at 1.00 and pass along all investment earnings to their investors as interest.

Until 2008, only one fund had "broken the buck," that is, suffered losses large enough to force value per share below  \$1. But when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection on September 15, 2008, several funds that had invested heavily in its commercial paper suffered large losses. The next day, the Reserve Primary Fund, the oldest money market fund, broke the buck when its value per share fell to only$ .97.

The realization that money market funds were at risk in the credit crisis led to a wave of investor redemptions similar to a run on a bank. In response, the U.S. Treasury announced that it would make federal insurance available to money market funds willing to pay an insurance fee. This program would thus be similar to FDIC bank insurance. With the federal insurance in place, the outflows were quelled.

However, the turmoil in Wall Street's money market funds had already spilled over into "Main Street." Fearing further investor redemptions, money market funds became afraid to commit funds even over short periods, and their demand for commercial paper effectively dried up. Firms throughout the economy had come to depend on those markets as a major source of short-term finance to fund expenditures ranging from salaries to inventories. Further breakdown in the money markets would have had an immediate crippling effect on the broad economy.

To end the panic and stabilize the money markets, the federal government decided to guarantee investments in money market funds. The guarantee did, in fact, calm investors and end the run, but it put the government on the hook for a potential liability of up to 3 trillion—the assets held in money market funds at the time.

U.S. regulators since approved a series of reforms to reduce the risks of runs on these funds. Institutional money market funds (those servicing institutions rather than private investors) are required to "float" the prices of their shares based on the value of their assets rather than maintain a fixed  \$1 value per share. This limits the incentive during a crisis for investors to compete to be the first to withdraw funds while share prices are maintained at a nonsustainable level of\$ 1. In addition, funds now have the authority to either limit redemptions or impose redemption fees of up to 2\% if a fund's assets fall by more than 30\%.

In 2021, however, the SEC floated new proposals to replace the ones put in place after the financial crisis. In the face of redemptions, funds typically sell their most-liquid holdings and can be left holding less-liquid assets just as their values might be falling. With share prices fixed at 1, this gives an incentive to investors to redeem their shares quickly before the buck may be broken. The SEC thus proposed a "swing factor" on days with net redemptions. The factor is intended to assess the impact of sales on the less liquid assets still held in fund portfolios. By aligning share prices to portfolio value, investors' incentives to cash out in front of other shareholders would presumably be minimized. These proposals have elicited considerable pushback from the industry, however.

To further limit volatility, the SEC also proposed an increase in the allowed share of money-market fund assets that mature within one day from  $10\%$  to  $25\%$  and in the share maturing in a week from  $30\%$  to  $50\%$ .

Today, there is greater concern paid to credit risk in the money market, and as a result investors now distinguish between prime and government funds. Government funds hold short-term U.S. Treasury or agency securities. Prime funds also hold other money market instruments, for example, commercial paper or CDs. For this reason, they are considered slightly riskier, and offer higher yields. We return to these funds in Chapter 4.

# 2.2 The Bond Market

The bond market is composed of longer term borrowing or debt instruments than those that trade in the money market. This market includes Treasury notes and bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, mortgage securities, and federal agency debt.

These instruments are sometimes said to comprise the fixed-income capital market because most of them promise either a fixed stream of income or a stream of income that is determined according to a specific formula. In practice, these formulas can result in a flow of income that is far from fixed. Therefore, the term fixed income is probably not fully appropriate. It is simpler and more straightforward to call these securities either debt instruments or bonds.

# Treasury Notes and Bonds

The U.S. government borrows funds in large part by selling Treasury notes and Treasury bonds. T-notes are issued with maturities ranging up to 10 years, while bonds are issued with maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years. Both notes and bonds may be issued in increments of \$100 but far more commonly trade in denominations of \$1,000. Both notes and bonds make semiannual interest payments called coupon payments, a name derived from precomputer days, when investors would literally clip a coupon attached to the bond and present it to receive the interest payment.

Figure 2.3 is a listing of Treasury issues. The coupon rate of the highlighted bond, which matures in February 2036, is  $4.50\%$ . Its bid price is 138.234. (This is the decimal version of  $138^{30} / _{128}$ . The minimum tick size, or price increment in the Treasury-bond market, is generally  ${}^{1} / _{128}$  of a point.) Although bonds are typically traded in denominations of \$1,000 par value, prices are quoted as a percentage of par. Thus, the bid price should be interpreted as  $138.234\%$  of par, or  $\$1,382.34$  for the  $\$1,000$  par value bond. Similarly, the ask price at which the bond could be purchased from a dealer is  $138.244\%$  of par, or  $\$1,382.44$ . The .960 change means that the asked price on this day increased by .960\% of par value (equivalently, by  ${}^{123} / _{128}$  of a point) from the previous day's close. Finally, the yield to maturity based on the asked price is  $1.525\%$ .

The yield to maturity reported in the last column is calculated by doubling the semiannual yield, rather than compounding it for two half-year periods. This use of a simple interest technique to annualize means that the yield is quoted as an annual percentage rate (APR) rather than as an effective annual yield. The APR in this context is also called the bond equivalent yield. We discuss the yield to maturity in more detail in Part Four.

# Inflation-Protected Treasury Bonds

The natural place to start building an investment portfolio is at the least risky end of the spectrum. Around the world, governments of many countries, including the United States, have issued bonds that are linked to an index of the cost of living in order to provide their citizens with an effective way to hedge inflation risk.

In the United States, inflation-protected Treasury bonds are called TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities). The principal amount on these bonds is adjusted in proportion to increases in the Consumer Price Index. Therefore, they provide a constant stream of income in real (inflation-adjusted) dollars. Yields on TIPS bonds should be interpreted as real or inflation-adjusted interest rates. We return to TIPS bonds in more detail in Chapter 14.

# Federal Agency Debt

Some government agencies issue their own securities to finance their activities. These agencies usually are formed to channel credit to a particular sector of the economy that Congress believes might not receive adequate credit through normal private sources.

The major mortgage-related agencies are the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae), the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or Ginnie Mae), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, or Freddie Mac). The FHLB borrows money by issuing securities and lends this money to savings and loan institutions to be lent in turn to individuals borrowing for home mortgages.

Although the debt of federal agencies was never explicitly insured by the federal government, it had long been assumed that the government would assist an agency nearing default. Those beliefs were validated when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac encountered severe financial distress in September 2008. With both firms on the brink of insolvency, the government stepped in, put them both into conservatorship, and assigned the Federal Housing Finance Agency to run the firms; however, it did in fact agree to make good on the firm's bonds.

# International Bonds

Many firms borrow abroad, and many investors buy bonds from foreign issuers. In addition to national capital markets, there is a thriving international capital market, largely centered in London.

A Eurobond is a bond denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which it is issued. For example, a dollar-denominated bond sold in Britain would be called a Eurodollar bond. Similarly, investors might speak of Euroyen bonds, yen-denominated bonds sold outside Japan. Because the European currency is called the euro, the term Eurobond may be confusing. It is best to think of them simply as international bonds.

In contrast to bonds that are issued in foreign currencies, many firms issue bonds in foreign countries but in the currency of the investor. For example, a Yankee bond is a dollar-denominated bond sold in the United States by a non-U.S. issuer. Similarly, Samurai bonds are yen-denominated bonds sold in Japan by non-Japanese issuers.

# Municipal Bonds

Municipal bonds are issued by state and local governments. They are similar to Treasury and corporate bonds except that their interest income is exempt from federal income taxation. The interest income also is usually exempt from state and local taxation in the issuing state. Capital gains taxes, however, must be paid on "munis" when the bonds mature or if they are sold for more than the investor's purchase price.

General obligation bonds are backed by the "full faith and credit" (i.e., the taxing power) of the issuer, while revenue bonds are issued to finance particular projects and are backed either by the revenues from that project or by the particular municipal agency operating the project. Typical issuers of revenue bonds are airports, hospitals, and turnpike or port authorities. Obviously, revenue bonds are riskier in terms of default than general obligation bonds. Figure 2.4 plots outstanding amounts of both types of municipal securities.

An industrial development bond is a revenue bond that is issued to finance commercial enterprises, such as the construction of a factory that can be operated by a private firm. In effect, these private-purpose bonds give the firm access to the municipality's ability to borrow at tax-exempt rates, and the federal government limits the amount of these bonds that may be issued.[2]

Like Treasury bonds, municipal bonds vary widely in maturity. A good deal of the debt issued is in the form of short-term tax anticipation notes, which raise funds to pay for expenses before actual collection of taxes. Other municipal debt is long term and used to fund large capital investments. Maturities range up to 30 years.

The key feature of municipal bonds is their tax-exempt status. Because investors pay neither federal nor state taxes on the interest proceeds, they are willing to accept lower yields on these securities.

An investor choosing between taxable and tax-exempt bonds must compare after-tax returns on each bond. An exact comparison requires a computation of after-tax rates of return that explicitly accounts for taxes on income and realized capital gains. In practice, there is a simpler rule of thumb. If we let  $t$  denote the investor's combined federal plus local marginal tax bracket and  $r_{\text{taxable}}$  denote the total before-tax rate of return available on taxable bonds, then  $r_{\mathrm{taxable}}(1 - t)$  is the after-tax rate available on those securities. If this value exceeds the rate on municipal bonds,  $r_{\mathrm{muni}}$ , the investor does better holding the taxable bonds. Otherwise, the tax-exempt municipalities provide higher after-tax returns.


One way to compare bonds is to determine the interest rate on taxable bonds that would be necessary to provide an after-tax return equal to that of principals. To derive this value, we set after-tax yields equal and solve for the equivalent taxable yield of the tax-exempt bond. This is the rate a taxable bond must offer to match the after-tax yield on the tax-free municipal.

$$ r _ {\text {t a x a b l e}} (1 - t) = r _ {\text {m u n i}} \tag {2.1}
$$ or


$$ r _ {\text {t a x a b l e}} = r _ {\text {m u n i}} / (1 - t) \tag {2.2}
$$

Thus, the equivalent taxable yield is simply the tax-free rate divided by  $1 - t$ . Table 2.1 presents equivalent taxable yields for several municipal yields and tax rates.

This table frequently appears in the marketing literature for tax-exempt mutual bond funds because it demonstrates to high-tax-bracket investors that municipal bonds offer highly attractive equivalent taxable yields. Each entry is calculated from Equation 2.2. If the equivalent taxable yield exceeds the actual yields offered on taxable bonds, the investor is better off after taxes holding municipal bonds. Notice that the equivalent taxable interest rate increases with the investor's tax bracket; the higher the bracket, the more valuable the tax-exempt feature of Municipals. Thus, high-tax-bracket investors tend to hold Municipals.

We also can use Equation 2.1 or 2.2 to find the tax bracket at which investors are indifferent between taxable and tax-exempt bonds. The cutoff tax bracket is given by solving Equation 2.2 for the tax bracket at which after-tax yields are equal. Doing so, we find that

$$
\text {C u t o f f} = 1 - \frac {r _ {\text {m u n i}}}{r _ {\text {t a x a b l e}}} \tag {2.3}
$$

Thus, the yield ratio  $r_{\mathrm{muni}} / r_{\mathrm{taxable}}$  is a key determinant of the attractiveness of municipal bonds. The higher the yield ratio, the lower the cutoff tax bracket, and the more individuals will prefer to hold municipal debt.

As a rough guide to the cutoff tax bracket, Figure 2.5 plots the ratio of 20-year municipal debt yields to the yield on Baa-rated corporate debt. The default risk of these corporate

Equivalent taxable yields corresponding to various tax-exempt yields and municipal bonds may be comparable, but certainly will fluctuate over time. For example, the sharp run-up in the ratio beginning in 2011 probably reflects increased concern at the time about the precarious financial condition of several states and municipalities, leading to higher credit spreads on their bonds.

# Example 2.1 Taxable versus Tax-Exempt Yields

Figure 2.5 shows that for most of the last 40 years, the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields fluctuated around .70. What does this imply about the cutoff tax bracket above which tax-exempt bonds provide higher after-tax yields? Equation 2.3 shows that an investor whose tax bracket (federal plus local) exceeds  $1 - .70 = .30$ , or  $30\%$ , will derive a greater after-tax yield from principals. As we pointed out, however, it is difficult to control precisely for differences in the risks of these bonds, so the cutoff tax bracket must be taken as approximate.

# Concept Check 2.2

Suppose your combined federal plus state tax bracket is  $30\%$ . Would you prefer to earn a  $6\%$  taxable return or a  $4\%$  tax-free return? What is the equivalent taxable yield of the  $4\%$  tax-free yield?

# Corporate Bonds

Corporate bonds are the means by which private firms borrow money directly from the public. These bonds are similar in structure to Treasury issues—they typically pay semi-annual coupons over their lives and return the face value to the bondholder at maturity. They differ most importantly from Treasury bonds because of default risk, and Chapter 14 discusses this issue in considerable detail. For now, we distinguish only among secured bonds, which have specific collateral backing them in the event of firm bankruptcy; unsecured bonds, called debentures, which have no collateral; and subordinated debentures, which have a lower priority claim to the firm's assets in the event of bankruptcy.


Corporate bonds sometimes come with options attached. Callable bonds give the firm the option to repurchase the bond from the holder at a stipulated call price. Convertible bonds give the bondholder the option to convert each bond into a stipulated number of shares of stock. These options are treated in more detail in Chapter 14.

# Mortgage and Asset-Backed Securities

Using mortgage-backed securities, almost anyone can invest in a portfolio of mortgage loans, and these securities have become a major component of the fixed-income market. As described in Chapter 1, a mortgage-backed security is either an ownership claim in a pool of mortgages or an obligation that is secured by such a pool. Most pass-throughs have traditionally been composed of conforming mortgages, which means that the loans must satisfy certain underwriting guidelines (standards for the creditworthiness of the borrower) before they may be purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, however, a large amount of subprime mortgages, that is, riskier loans made to financially weaker borrowers, were bundled and sold by "private-label" issuers. Figure 2.6 shows that both agency and private-label mortgage-backed securities enjoyed explosive growth, at least until the crisis.

In an effort to make housing more affordable to low-income households, Fannie and Freddie had been encouraged to buy subprime mortgage securities. As we saw in Chapter 1, these loans turned out to be disastrous, with trillion-dollar losses spread among banks, hedge funds and other investors, and Freddie and Fannie, which lost billions of dollars on the subprime mortgage pools they had purchased. You can see from Figure 2.6 that starting in 2007, the market in private-label mortgage pass-throughs began to shrink rapidly.

Despite these troubles, securitization has become an increasingly common staple of many credit markets. For example, car loans, student loans, home equity loans, credit card loans, and even debt of private firms now are commonly bundled into pass-through securities that can be traded in the capital market. Figure 2.7 documents the rapid growth of nonmortgage asset-backed securities, at least until 2007. After the financial crisis and during Covid, the market contracted considerably, but it is still substantial.

# 2.3 Equity Securities

# Common Stock as Ownership Shares

Common stocks, also known as equity securities or equities, represent ownership shares in a corporation. Each share of common stock entitles its owner to one vote on any matters of corporate governance that are put to a vote at the corporation's annual meeting and to a share in the financial benefits of ownership.

The corporation is controlled by a board of directors elected by the shareholders. The board, which meets only a few times each year, selects managers who actually run the firm on a day-to-day basis. Managers have the authority to make most business decisions without the board's specific approval. The board's mandate is to oversee the management to ensure that it acts in the best interests of shareholders.

The members of the board are elected at the annual meeting. Shareholders who do not attend the annual meeting can vote by proxy, empowering another party to vote in their name. Management usually solicits the proxies of shareholders and normally gets a vast majority of these proxy votes. Thus, management usually has considerable discretion to run the firm as it sees fit—without daily oversight from the equityholders who actually own the firm.

We noted in Chapter 1 that such separation of ownership and control can give rise to "agency problems," in which managers pursue goals not in the best interests of shareholders. However, several mechanisms alleviate these problems. Among these are compensation schemes that link the success of the manager to that of the firm; oversight by the board of directors as well as outsiders such as security analysts, creditors, or large institutional investors; the threat of a proxy contest in which unhappy shareholders attempt to replace the current management team; or the threat of a takeover by another firm.

The common stock of most large corporations can be bought or sold freely on one or more stock markets. A corporation whose stock is not publicly traded is said to be private. In most privately held corporations, the owners of the firm also take an active role in its management. Therefore, takeovers are generally not an issue.

# Characteristics of Common Stock

The two most important characteristics of common stock as an investment are its residual claim and limited liability features.

Residual claim means that stockholders are the last in line of all those who have a claim on the assets and income of the corporation. In a liquidation of the firm's assets, the shareholders have a claim to what is left after all other claimants such as the tax authorities, employees, suppliers, bondholders, and other creditors have been paid. For a firm not in liquidation, shareholders have claim to the part of operating income left over after interest and taxes have been paid. Management can either pay this residual as cash dividends to shareholders or reinvest it in the business to increase the value of the shares.

Limited liability means that the most shareholders can lose in the event of failure of the corporation is their original investment. Unlike owners of unincorporated businesses, whose creditors can lay claim to the personal assets of the owner (house, car, furniture), corporate shareholders may at worst have worthless stock. They are not personally liable for the firm's obligations.

# Stock Market Listings

Figure 2.8 presents key trading data for a small sample of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The NYSE is one of several markets in which investors may buy or sell shares of stock. We will examine these markets in detail in Chapter 3.

To interpret Figure 2.8, consider the highlighted listing for Hershey. The table provides the ticker symbol (HSY), the closing price of the stock (\$177.57), and its change (\$1.64) from the previous trading day. About 658,000 shares of Hershey traded on this day.

The annual dividend over the coming year is forecast at 3.22, which implies a annual dividend yield (i.e., annual dividend per dollar paid for the stock) of 3.22/177.57 = .0181, or 1.81\%.

The dividend yield is only part of the return on a stock investment. It ignores prospective capital gains (i.e., price increases) or losses. Low-dividend firms presumably offer greater prospects for capital gains, or investors would not be willing to hold these stocks in their portfolios. If you scan Figure 2.8, you will see that dividend yields vary widely across companies.

The P/E ratio, or price-earnings ratio, is the ratio of the current stock price to last year's earnings per share. The P/E ratio tells us how much stock purchasers must pay per dollar of earnings that the firm generates. For Hershey, the ratio of price to earnings is 26.42. The P/E ratio also varies widely across firms. Where the dividend yield and P/E ratio are not reported in Figure 2.8, the firms have zero dividends, or zero or negative earnings. We shall have much to say about P/E ratios in Chapter 18.

# Preferred Stock

Preferred stock has features similar to both equity and debt. Like a bond, it promises to pay a fixed amount of income each year. In this sense, preferred stock is similar to an infinite-maturity bond, that is, a perpetuity. It also resembles a bond in that it does not convey voting power regarding the management of the firm.

Preferred stock is nevertheless an equity investment. The firm has no contractual obligation to make the dividend payments. Instead, preferred dividends are usually cumulative; that is, unpaid dividends cumulate and must be paid in full before any dividends may be paid to holders of common stock. In contrast, the firm does have a contractual obligation to make the interest payments on the debt. Failure to make these payments sets off corporate bankruptcy proceedings.

Preferred stock also differs from bonds in terms of tax treatment. Because preferred stock payments are treated as dividends rather than interest, they are not tax-deductible expenses for the firm. This disadvantage is somewhat offset by the fact that corporations may exclude  $50\%$  of dividends received from domestic corporations when they compute taxable income. Preferred stocks therefore are desirable fixed-income investments for some corporations.

Even though preferred stock ranks after bonds in terms of the priority of its claims to the assets of the firm in the event of corporate bankruptcy, it often sells at lower yields.

Presumably, this reflects the value of the  $50\%$  dividend exclusion because the higher risk of preferred stock would tend to result in higher yields than those offered by bonds. Individual investors, who cannot use the tax exclusion, generally will find preferred stock yields unattractive relative to those on other assets.

Preferred stock is issued in variations similar to those of corporate bonds. It may be callable, in which case it is said to be redeemable. It also may be convertible into common stock at some specified conversion ratio. Adjustable-rate preferred stock is another variation that, like adjustable-rate bonds, ties the dividend to current market interest rates.

# Depositary Receipts

American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, are certificates traded in U.S. markets that represent ownership in shares of a foreign company. Each ADR may correspond to ownership of a fraction of a foreign share, one share, or several shares of the foreign corporation. ADRs were created to make it easier for foreign firms to satisfy U.S. security registration requirements. They are the most common way for U.S. investors to directly invest in and trade the shares of foreign corporations.

# 2.4 Stock and Bond Market Indexes

# Stock Market Indexes

The daily performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a staple portion of the evening news. Although the Dow is the best-known measure of the performance of the stock market, it is only one of several indicators, and far from the best. Other more broadly based indexes are computed and published daily. In addition, several indexes of bond market performance are widely available.

The ever-increasing role of international trade and investments has made indexes of foreign financial markets part of the general news as well. Thus, foreign stock exchange indexes such as the Nikkei Average of Tokyo and the Financial Times index of London have become household names.

# Dow Jones Industrial Average

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) of 30 large, "blue-chip" corporations has been computed since 1896. Its long history probably accounts for its preeminence in the public mind. (The average covered only 20 stocks until 1928.)

Originally, the DJIA was calculated as the average price of the stocks included in the index. Thus, one would add up the prices of the 30 stocks in the index and divide by 30. The percentage change in the DJIA would then be the percentage change in the average price of the 30 shares.

Therefore, the percentage change in the DJIA measures the return (excluding dividends) on a portfolio that invests one share in each of the 30 stocks in the index. The value of such a portfolio (holding one share of each stock in the index) is the sum of the 30 prices. Because the percentage change in the average of the 30 prices is the same as the percentage change in the sum of the 30 prices, the index and the portfolio have the same percentage change each day.

Data to construct stock price indexes

Table 2.2

<table><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Initial Price</td><td>Final Price</td><td>Shares (million)</td><td>Initial Value of Outstanding Stock ($ million)</td><td>Final Value of Outstanding Stock ($ million)</td></tr><tr><td>ABC</td><td>$ 25</td><td>$30</td><td>20</td><td>$500</td><td>$600</td></tr><tr><td>XYZ</td><td>100</td><td>90</td><td>1</td><td>100</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>$600</td><td>$690</td></tr></table>

Because the Dow corresponds to a portfolio that holds one share of each component stock, the investment in each company in that portfolio is proportional to the company's share price. Therefore, the Dow is called a price-weighted average.

# Example 2.2 Price-Weighted Average

Consider the data in Table 2.2 for a hypothetical two-stock version of the Dow Jones Average. Let's compare the changes in the value of the portfolio holding one share of each firm and the price-weighted index. Stock ABC starts at  \$25 a share and increases to\$ 30. Stock XYZ starts at \$100 but falls to \$90.

```txt
Portfolio: Initial value = \ 25 + \$ 100 = \$ 125 Final value =\ 30 + \ 90 = \$ 120 Percentage change in portfolio value = -5 / 125 = -.04 = -4\% Index: Initial index value = (25 + 100)/2 = 62.5 Final index value = (30 + 90)/2 = 60 Percentage change in index \doteq -2.5 / 62.5 = -.04 = -4\%
```

The portfolio and the index have identical  $4\%$  declines in value.

Notice that price-weighted averages give higher-priced shares more weight in determining performance of the index. For example, although ABC increased by  $20\%$ , while XYZ fell by only  $10\%$ , the index dropped in value. This is because the  $20\%$  increase in ABC represented a smaller price gain (5 per share) than the  $10\%$  decrease in XYZ (10 per share). The "Dow portfolio" has four times as much invested in XYZ as in ABC because XYZ's price is four times that of ABC. We conclude that a high-price stock can dominate a price-weighted average.

You might wonder why the DJIA is now (in mid-2022) at a level of about 31,000 if it is supposed to be the average price of the 30 stocks in the index. The DJIA no longer equals the average price of the 30 stocks because the averaging procedure is adjusted whenever a stock splits or pays a stock dividend of more than  $10\%$ , or when one company in the group of 30 industrial firms is replaced by another. When these events occur, the divisor used to compute the "average price" is adjusted so as to leave the index unaffected by the event.

# Example 2.3 Splits and Price-Weighted Averages

Suppose XYZ from Example 2.2 splits two for one so that its share price falls to 50. We would not want the average to fall, as that would incorrectly indicate a fall in the general level of market prices. Following a split, the divisor is reduced to a value that leaves the average unaffected.

We find the new divisor using the post-split price data from Table 2.3. The index value before the stock split  $= 125 / 2 = 62.5$ . We must find a new divisor,  $d$ , that leaves the index unchanged after XYZ splits and its price falls to \$50. Therefore, we solve for  $d$  in the following equation:

$$
\frac {\text {P r i c e o f A B C} + \text {P r i c e o f X Y Z}}{d} = \frac {2 5 + 5 0}{d} = 6 2. 5
$$ which implies that the divisor must fall from its original value of 2.0 to a new value of 1.20.


Because the split changes the price of stock XYZ, it changes the relative weights of the two stocks in the price-weighted average. Therefore, the return of the index is also affected.

At period-end, ABC will sell for  \$30, while XYZ will sell for\$ 45, representing the same negative 10\% return it was assumed to earn in Table 2.2. The new value of the price-weighted average will be (30 + 45)/1.20 = 62.5, the same as its value at the start of the year; therefore, its return is zero, rather than the -4\% return that we calculated in the absence of a split.

The split reduces the relative weight of XYZ because its initial price is lower, and because XYZ is the poorer performing stock, the performance of the average is higher. We see that the implicit weighting scheme of a price-weighted average is somewhat arbitrary, being determined by the prices rather than by the outstanding market values (price per share times number of shares) of the shares in the average.

<table><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Initial Price</td><td>Final Price</td><td>Shares (million)</td><td>Initial Value of Outstanding Stock ($ million)</td><td>Final Value of Outstanding Stock ($ million)</td></tr><tr><td>ABC</td><td>$25</td><td>$30</td><td>20</td><td>$500</td><td>$600</td></tr><tr><td>XYZ</td><td>50</td><td>45</td><td>2</td><td>100</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>$600</td><td>$690</td></tr></table>

Table 2.3

Data to construct stock price indexes after a stock split

In the same way that the divisor is updated for stock splits, if one firm is dropped from the average and another firm with a different price is added, the divisor has to be updated to leave the average unchanged by the substitution. By 2022, the divisor for the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen to a value of about .152.

Because the Dow Jones averages are based on small numbers of firms, care must be taken to ensure that they are representative of the broad market. As a result, the composition of the average is changed every so often to reflect changes in the economy. Table 2.4 presents the composition of the Dow industrials in 1928 as well as its composition as of 2022. The table presents striking evidence of the changes in the U.S. economy in the last century. Many of the "bluest of the blue chip" companies in 1928 no longer exist, and the industries that were the backbone of the economy in 1928 have given way to some that could not have been imagined at the time.

Table 2.4

# Concept Check 2.4

Suppose the price of XYZ in Table 2.2 increases to  \$110, while ABC falls to\$ 20. Find the percentage change in the price-weighted average of these two stocks. Compare that to the percentage return of a portfolio holding one share in each company.

# The Standard & Poor's 500 Index

The Standard & Poor's Composite 500 (S&P 500) stock index represents an improvement over the Dow Jones Averages in two ways. First, it is a more broadly based index of about 500 firms. Second, it is a market-value-weighted index. For firms XYZ and ABC in Example 2.2, the S&P 500 would give ABC five times the weight given to XYZ because the market value of its outstanding equity is five times larger, \$500 million versus \$100 million.

The S&P 500 is computed by calculating the total market value of the 500 firms in the index and the total market value of those firms on the previous day of trading. The percentage increase in the total market value from one day to the next represents the increase in the index. The rate of return of the index equals the rate of return that would be earned by an investor holding a portfolio of all 500 firms in the index in proportion to their market values, except that the index does not reflect dividends paid by those firms.

Actually, most indexes today use a modified version of market-value weights. Rather than weighting by total market value, they weight by the market value of free float, that is, by the value of shares that are freely tradable among investors. For example, this procedure does not count shares held by founding families or governments. These shares are effectively not available for investors to purchase. The distinction is more important in Japan and Europe, where a higher fraction of shares are held in such nontraded portfolios.

# Example 2.4 Value-Weighted Indexes

To illustrate how value-weighted indexes are computed, look again at Table 2.2. The final value of all outstanding stock in our two-stock universe is  \$690 million. The initial value was\$ 600 million. Therefore, if the initial level of a market-value-weighted index of stocks ABC and XYZ were set equal to an arbitrarily chosen starting value such as 100, the index value at year-end would be  $100 \times (690 / 600) = 115$ . The increase in the index reflects the 15\% return earned on a portfolio consisting of those two stocks held in proportion to outstanding market values.

Unlike the price-weighted index, the value-weighted index gives more weight to ABC. Whereas the price-weighted index fell because it was dominated by higher-price XYZ, the value-weighted index rises because it gives more weight to ABC, the stock with the higher total market value.

Note also from Tables 2.2 and 2.3 that market-value-weighted indexes are unaffected by stock splits. The total market value of the outstanding XYZ stock decreases from  \$100 million to\$ 90 million regardless of the stock split, thereby rendering the split irrelevant to the performance of the index.

# Concept Check 2.5

Reconsider companies XYZ and ABC from Concept Check 2.4. Calculate the percentage change in the market-value-weighted index. Compare that to the rate of return of a portfolio that holds \$500 of ABC stock for every \$100 of XYZ stock (i.e., an index portfolio).

A nice feature of both market-value-weighted and price-weighted indexes is that they reflect the returns to straightforward portfolio strategies. If you buy shares in each component firm in the index in proportion to its outstanding market value, your return will match that of the value-weighted index. Similarly, a price-weighted index tracks the returns on a portfolio composed of an equal number of shares of each firm.

Investors can easily buy market indexes for their portfolios. One way is to purchase shares in mutual funds that hold shares in proportion to their representation in the S&P 500 or another index. These index funds earn a return equal to that of the index and so provide a low-cost passive investment strategy for equity investors. Another approach is to purchase an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, which is a portfolio of shares that can be bought or sold as a unit, just as one can buy or sell a single share of stock. Available ETFs range from portfolios that track extremely broad global market indexes all the way to narrow industry indexes. We discuss both mutual funds and ETFs in detail in Chapter 4.

# Russell Indexes

The Russell indexes are a family of indexes that measure the performance of distinct market segments, primarily segmented by size. While the Russell 3000 measures the performance of the largest 3,000 U.S. stocks, the Russell 2500 measures the bottom 2,500 stocks included in the Russell 3000 and is thus a popular index for mid-cap to small-cap stocks ("cap" is an abbreviation for market capitalization, the total value of outstanding shares). Other indexes are the Russell 1000 (the largest 1,000 firms in the Russell 3000), the Russell Top 200 and Top 50, and the Russell Microcap (comprising the stocks ranked 2,001 through 4,000) by market cap.

The stocks included in each of these indexes are updated once a year. The indexes are capitalization weighted.

# Other U.S. Market-Value Indexes

The New York Stock Exchange publishes a market-value-weighted composite index of all NYSE-listed stocks, in addition to subindexes for industrial, utility, transportation, and financial stocks. NASDAQ computes a Composite index of more than 3,000 firms traded on the NASDAQ market. The NASDAQ 100 is a subset of the larger firms in the Composite Index, but it accounts for a large fraction of its total market capitalization.

The ultimate U.S. equity index so far computed is the Wilshire 5000 index of the market value of essentially all actively traded stocks in the United States. At one point, it included more than 5,000 stocks, but today, there are only about 3,500 stocks in the index. A similar comprehensive index is published by CRSP (the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago).

# Equally Weighted Indexes

Market performance is sometimes measured by an equally weighted average of the returns of each stock in an index. Such an averaging technique, by placing equal weight on each return, corresponds to an implicit portfolio strategy that invests equal dollar values in each stock. This is in contrast to both price weighting (which requires equal numbers of shares of each stock) and market-value weighting (which requires investments in proportion to outstanding value).

Unlike price- or market-value-weighted indexes, equally weighted indexes do not correspond to buy-and-hold portfolio strategies. Suppose that you start with equal dollar investments in the two stocks of Table 2.2, ABC and XYZ. Because ABC increases in value by  $20\%$  over the year while XYZ decreases by  $10\%$ , your portfolio no longer is equally weighted. It is now more heavily invested in ABC. To reset the portfolio to equal weights,

Table 2.5 you would need to rebalance: Sell off some ABC stock and/or purchase more XYZ stock. Such rebalancing would be necessary to align the return on your portfolio with that on the equally weighted index.


# Foreign and International Stock Market Indexes

Development in financial markets worldwide includes the construction of indexes for these markets. Among these are the Nikkei (Japan), FTSE (U.K.; pronounced "footsie"), DAX (Germany), Hang Seng (Hong Kong), and TSX (Canada).

A leader in the construction of international indexes has been MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International), which computes dozens of country indexes and several regional indexes. Table 2.5 presents many of the indexes computed by MSCI.

# Bond Market Indicators

Just as stock market indexes provide guidance concerning the performance of the overall stock market, several bond market indicators measure the performance of various categories of bonds. The most well-known indexes are those of Merrill Lynch, Barclays, and the

The major problem with bond market indexes is that rates of return on many bonds are difficult to compute because the infrequency with which the bonds trade makes reliable up-to-date prices difficult to obtain. In practice, some prices must be estimated from bond-valuation models. These "matrix" prices may differ from true market values.

# 2.5 Derivative Markets

Futures, options, and related derivatives contracts provide payoffs that depend on the values of other variables such as commodity prices, bond and stock prices, interest rates, or market index values. For this reason, these instruments sometimes are called derivative assets: Their values derive from the values of other assets. These assets are also called contingent claims because their payoffs are contingent on the value of other values.

# Options

A call option gives its holder the right to purchase an asset for a specified price, called the exercise or strike price, on or before a specified expiration date. For example, a January expiration call option on Microsoft stock with an exercise price of \$280 entitles its owner to purchase Microsoft stock for a price of \$280 at any time up to and including the expiration date. Each option contract is for the purchase of 100 shares. However, quotations are made on a per-share basis. The holder of the call is not required to exercise the option; it will be profitable to exercise only if the price of the underlying asset exceeds the exercise price.

When the market price exceeds the exercise price, the option holder may "call away" the asset for the exercise price and reap a payoff equal to the difference between the stock price and the exercise price. Otherwise, the option will be left unexercised. If not exercised before the expiration date of the contract, the option simply expires and no longer has value. Calls therefore provide greater profits when stock prices increase and thus represent bullish investment vehicles.

# Table 2.6

Stock options on Microsoft, July 14, 2021.

In contrast, a put option gives its holder the right to sell an asset for a specified exercise price on or before a specified expiration date. A January expiration put on Microsoft with an exercise price of  \$280 thus entitles its owner to sell Microsoft stock to the put writer at a price of\$ 280 at any time before expiration in January, even if the market price of Microsoft is lower than 280. Whereas profits on call options increase when the asset price increases, profits on put options increase when the asset price falls. The put is exercised only if its holder can deliver an asset worth less than the exercise price in return for the exercise price.

Table 2.6 presents prices of Microsoft options on July 14, 2021. The price of Microsoft shares on this date was  \$282.51. The first two columns give the expiration date and exercise (or strike) price for each option. We have included listings for call and put options with exercise prices of$ 280, $285, and \$290 per share and with expiration dates in August and September. For example, the August 6 expiration call option to purchase one share of Microsoft at an exercise price of \$285 last traded at \$5.06. Each option contract (on 100 shares) therefore costs 506.

Notice that the prices of call options decrease as the exercise price increases. For example, the August expiration call with exercise price  \$290 costs only\$ 3.31. This makes sense, because the right to purchase a share at a higher price is less valuable. Conversely, put prices increase with the exercise price. The right to sell Microsoft at a price of \$285 in August costs \$7.48, while the right to sell at \$290 costs \$10.35.

Option prices also increase with time until expiration. Clearly, one would rather have the right to buy Microsoft for  \$285 at any time until September rather than at any time until August. Not surprisingly, this shows up in a higher price for the longer expiration options. For example, the call with exercise price\$ 285 expiring on September 17 sells for \$8.45 compared to only \$5.06 for the August 6 expiration call.

# Concept Check 2.6

What is the profit or loss per share to an investor who buys the September 17, 2021, expiration Microsoft call option with exercise price  \$285 if the stock price at the expiration date is\$ 295? What about a purchaser of the put option with the same exercise price and expiration?

# Futures Contracts

A futures contract calls for delivery of an asset (or, in some cases, its cash value) at a specified delivery or maturity date for an agreed-upon price, called the futures price, also to be paid at contract maturity. The long position is held by the trader who commits to

Conversely, the short position commits to delivering the asset.

Table 2.7 presents trading information for corn futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Each contract calls for delivery of 5,000 bushels of corn. The first entry is for the nearest term or "front" contract, with maturity in September 2021. The futures price for delivery in September was 5.64 per bushel.


The trader holding the long position profits from price increases. Suppose that at contract maturity, corn is selling for  \$5.66 per bushel. The long position trader who entered the contract on July 15 would pay the previously agreed-upon price of\$ 5.64 for each bushel of corn, which at contract maturity would be worth 5.66.

Because each contract calls for delivery of 5,000 bushels, the profit to the long position would equal  $5,000 \times ($ 5.66 - $5.64) = $100. Conversely, the short position must deliver 5,000 bushels for the previously agreed-upon futures price. The short position's loss equals the long position's profit.

The right to purchase the asset at an agreed-upon price, as opposed to the obligation, distinguishes call options from long positions in futures contracts. A futures contract obliges the long position to purchase the asset at the futures price; the call option, in contrast, conveys the right to purchase the asset at the exercise price. The purchase will be made only if it yields a profit.

Clearly, a holder of a call has a better position than the holder of a long position on a futures contract with a futures price equal to the option's exercise price. This advantage, of course, comes only at a price. Call options must be purchased; futures contracts are entered into without cost. The purchase price of an option is called the premium. It represents the compensation the purchaser of the call must pay for the ability to exercise the option only when it is profitable to do so. Similarly, the difference between a put option and a short futures position is the right, as opposed to the obligation, to sell an asset at an agreed-upon price.

# SUMMARY

1. Money market securities are very-short-term debt obligations. They are usually highly marketable and have relatively low credit risk. Their low maturities and low credit risk ensure minimal capital gains or losses. These securities trade in large denominations, but they may be purchased indirectly through money market mutual funds.
2. Much of U.S. government borrowing is in the form of Treasury bonds and notes. These are coupon-paying bonds usually issued at or near par value. Treasury notes and bonds are similar in design to coupon-paying corporate bonds.
3. Municipal bonds are distinguished largely by their tax-exempt status. Interest payments (but not capital gains) on these securities are exempt from federal income taxes. The equivalent taxable yield offered by a municipal bond equals  $r_{\mathrm{muni}} / (1 - t)$ , where  $r_{\mathrm{muni}}$  is the municipal yield and  $t$  is the investor's tax bracket.
4. Mortgage pass-through securities are pools of mortgages sold in one package. Owners of pass-throughs receive the principal and interest payments made by the borrowers. The originator that issued the mortgage merely services it and "passes through" the payments to the purchasers of the pool. A federal agency may guarantee the payments of interest and principal on mortgages pooled into its pass-through securities, but these guarantees are absent in private-label pass-throughs.

5. Common stock is an ownership share in a corporation. Each share entitles its owner to one vote on matters of corporate governance and to a prorated share of the dividends paid to shareholders. Stock (equivalently, equity) owners are the residual claimants on the income earned by the firm.
6. Preferred stock usually pays fixed dividends for the life of the firm; it is a perpetuity. A firm's failure to pay the dividend due on preferred stock, however, does not precipitate corporate bankruptcy. Instead, unpaid dividends simply cumulate. Variants of preferred stock include convertible and adjustable-rate issues.
7. Many stock market indexes measure the performance of the overall market. The Dow Jones averages, the oldest and best-known indicators, are price-weighted indexes. Today, many broad-based, market-value-weighted indexes are computed daily. These include the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, the NASDAQ index, the Wilshire 5000 index, and indexes of many non-U.S. stock markets.
8. A call option is a right to purchase an asset at a stipulated exercise price on or before an expiration date. A put option is the right to sell an asset at some exercise price. Calls increase in value while puts decrease in value as the price of the underlying asset increases.
9. A futures contract is an obligation to buy or sell an asset at a stipulated futures price on a maturity date. The long position, which commits to purchasing, gains if the asset value increases while the short position, which commits to delivering, loses.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. The bid price of the bond is 108.224\% of par, or \$1,082.24. The asked price is 108.244 or \$1,082.44. This asked price corresponds to a yield of 1.984\%. The asked price increased 1.128 from its level yesterday, so the asked price then must have been 107.116, or 1,071.16.

2. A  $6\%$  taxable return is equivalent to an after-tax return of  $6(1 - .30) = 4.2\%$ . Therefore, you would be better off in the taxable bond. The equivalent taxable yield of the tax-free bond is  $4/(1 - .30) = 5.71\%$ . So a taxable bond would have to pay a  $5.71\%$  yield to provide the same after-tax return as a tax-free bond offering a  $4\%$  yield.

3. a. You are entitled to a prorated share of Intel's dividend payments and to vote in any of IBM's stockholder meetings.

$b$ . Your potential gain is unlimited because the stock price has no upper bound.
 c. Your outlay was $55 × 100 = $5,500. Because of limited liability, this is the most you can lose.

4. The price-weighted index increases from 62.5 [i.e., (100 + 25)/2] to 65 [i.e., (110 + 20)/2], a gain of 4\%. An investment of one share in each company requires an outlay of \$125 that would increase in value to \$130, for a return of 4\% (i.e., 5/125), which equals the return to the price-weighted index.
 5. The market-value-weighted index return is calculated by computing the increase in the value of the stock portfolio. The portfolio of the two stocks starts with an initial value of \$100 million + \$500 million = \$600 million and falls in value to \$110 million + \$400 million = \$510 million, a loss of 90/600 = .15, or 15\%. The index portfolio return is a weighted average of the returns on each stock with weights of 1/6 on XYZ and 5/6 on ABC (weights proportional to relative investments). Because the return on XYZ is 10\%, while that on ABC is -20\%, the index portfolio return is 1/6 × 10\% + 5/6 × (-20\%) = -15\%, equal to the return on the market-value-weighted index.
