# How Securities Are Traded

# 3

THIS CHAPTER WILL provide you with a broad introduction to the many venues and procedures available for trading securities in the United States and international markets. We will see that trading mechanisms range from direct negotiation among market participants to fully automated computer crossing of trade orders.

The first time a security trades is when it is issued to the public. Therefore, we begin with a look at how securities are first marketed to the public by investment bankers, the midwives of securities. We turn next to a broad survey of how already-issued securities may be traded among investors, focusing on the differences among dealer markets, electronic markets, and specialist/ designated market maker markets. With this background, we consider specific trading arenas such as the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and several all-electronic markets. We compare the mechanics of trade execution and the impact of cross-market integration of trading.


We then turn to the essentials of some specific types of transactions, such as buying on margin and short-selling stocks. We close the chapter with a look at some important aspects of the regulations governing security trading, including insider trading laws, and the role of security markets as self-regulating organizations.

# 3.1 How Firms Issue Securities

Firms regularly need to raise new capital to help pay for their many investment projects. Broadly speaking, they can raise funds either by borrowing or by selling shares in the firm. Investment bankers are generally hired to manage the sale of these securities in what is called a primary market for newly issued securities. Once these securities are issued, however, investors might well wish to trade them among themselves. For example, you may decide to raise cash by selling some of your shares in Apple to another investor. This transaction would have no impact on the total outstanding number of Apple shares. Trades in existing securities take place in the so-called secondary market.

Shares of publicly listed firms trade continually in markets such as the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market. There, any investor can choose to buy shares for his or her portfolio. These companies are also called publicly traded, publicly owned, or just public companies. Other firms, however, are private corporations, whose shares are held by small numbers of managers and investors. Ownership stakes in the firm are still proportional to share ownership, but those shares do not trade in public markets. While many private firms are relatively young companies that have not yet chosen to make their shares generally available to the public, others may be more established firms that are still largely owned by the company's founders or families, and others may simply have decided that private organization is preferable.


# Privately Held Firms

A privately held company is owned by a relatively small number of shareholders. These firms have fewer obligations to release financial statements and other information to the public. This saves money and frees the firm from disclosing information that might be helpful to its competitors. Some firms also believe that eliminating requirements for quarterly earnings announcements gives them more flexibility to pursue long-term goals free of shareholder pressure.

When private firms wish to raise funds, they sell shares directly to institutional or wealthy investors in a private placement. Rule 144A of the SEC allows them to make these placements without preparing the extensive and costly registration statements required of a public company. While this is attractive, shares in privately held firms do not trade in secondary markets such as a stock exchange; this greatly reduces their liquidity and thus presumably reduces the prices that investors will pay for them. Liquidity has many specific meanings, but generally speaking, it refers to the ability to buy or sell an asset at a fair price on short notice. Investors demand price concessions to buy illiquid securities.

Until recently, private firms were allowed to have only up to 499 shareholders. This limited their ability to raise large amounts of capital from a wide base of investors. Thus, almost all of the largest companies in the U.S. have been public corporations.

As firms increasingly chafed against the informational requirements of going public, federal regulators came under pressure to loosen the constraints entailed by private ownership. The JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) Act of 2012 increased from 500 to 2,000 the number of shareholders a company may have before being required to register its common stock with the SEC and file public reports. The act also loosened rules limiting the degree to which private firms could market their shares to the public. For example, to make it easier for companies to engage in crowdfunding, small public offerings may be exempt from the obligation to register with the SEC. (We saw in Chapter 1 how initial coin offerings provide another path to obtain crowdfunding.)

The act also exempts smaller public companies (those with less than 1 billion in annual gross revenues) from Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which would otherwise require them to report on the adequacy of the company's financial controls. This provision of SOX had drawn particular criticism as an undue burden on small firms.

# Publicly Traded Companies

When a private firm decides that it wishes to raise capital from a wide range of investors, it may decide to go public. This means that it will sell its securities to the general public and allow those investors to freely trade those shares in established securities markets.

This first issue of shares to the general public is called the firm's initial public offering, or IPO. Later, the firm may go back to the public and issue additional shares. A seasoned equity offering is the sale of additional shares in firms that already are publicly traded. For example, a sale by Apple of new shares of stock would be considered a seasoned new issue.

Public offerings of both stocks and bonds typically are marketed by investment bankers who in this role are called underwriters. More than one investment banker usually markets the securities. A lead firm forms an underwriting syndicate of other investment bankers to share the responsibility for the stock issue.

Investment bankers advise the firm regarding the terms on which it should attempt to sell the securities. A preliminary registration statement must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), describing the issue and the prospects of the company. When the statement is in final form and accepted by the SEC, it is called the prospectus. At this point, the price at which the securities will be offered to the public is announced.

In a typical underwriting arrangement, the investment bankers purchase the securities from the issuing company and then resell them to the public. The issuing firm sells the securities to the underwriting syndicate for the public offering price less a spread that serves as compensation to the underwriters. This procedure is called a firm commitment because the underwriters bear the risk that they won't be able to sell the stock at the planned offering price. In addition to the spread, the investment banker also may receive shares of common stock or other securities of the firm. Figure 3.1 depicts the relationships among the firm issuing the security, the lead underwriter, the underwriting syndicate, and the public.

# Shelf Registration

An important innovation was introduced in 1982 when the SEC approved Rule 415 for seasoned offerings, which allows firms that are already publicly traded to register securities and gradually sell them to the public for three years following the initial registration. Because the securities are already registered, they can be sold on short notice, with little additional paperwork. Moreover, they can be sold in small amounts without incurring substantial flotation costs. The securities are "on the shelf," ready to be issued, which has given rise to the term shelf registration.

# Concept Check 3.1

Why does it make sense for shelf registration to be limited in time?

# Initial Public Offerings

Investment bankers manage the issuance of new securities to the public. Once the SEC has commented on the registration statement and a preliminary prospectus has been distributed to interested investors, the investment bankers organize road shows in which they travel around the country to publicize the imminent offering. These road shows serve two purposes. First, they generate interest among potential investors and provide information about the offering. Second, they provide information to the issuing firm and its underwriters about the price at which they will be able to market the securities. Large investors communicate their interest in purchasing shares of the IPO to the underwriters; these indications of interest are called a book, and the process of polling potential investors is called bookbuilding. The book provides valuable information to the issuing firm because institutional investors often will have useful insights about the market demand for the security as well as the prospects of the firm and its competitors. Investment bankers frequently revise both their initial estimates of the offering price of a security and the number of shares offered based on feedback from the investing community.

Why do investors truthfully reveal their interest in an offering to the investment banker? Might they be better off expressing little interest, in the hope that this will drive down the offering price? Truth is the better policy in this case because truth telling is rewarded. Shares of IPOs are allocated across investors in part based on the strength of each investor's expressed interest in the offering. If a firm wishes to get a large allocation when it is optimistic about the security, it needs to reveal its optimism. In turn, the underwriter needs to offer the security at a bargain price to these investors to induce them to participate in bookbuilding and share their information. Thus, IPOs commonly are underpriced compared to the price at which they could be marketed. Such underpricing is reflected in price jumps that occur on the date when the shares are first traded in public security markets.

Coursera's 2021 IPO was a fairly typical example of underpricing. The company issued about 15.7 million shares to the public at a price of  \$33. The stock price began trading at\$ 39 a share, a bit more than 18\% above the offering price.

While the explicit costs of an IPO tend to be around  $7\%$  of the funds raised, such underpricing should be viewed as another cost of the issue. For example, if Coursera had sold its shares for the \$39 that investors obviously were willing to pay for them, its IPO would have raised  $18\%$  more money than it actually did. The money "left on the table" in this case exceeded the explicit cost of the stock issue. Nevertheless, underpricing seems to be a universal phenomenon. Figure 3.2 presents average first-day returns on IPOs of stocks across the world. The results consistently indicate that IPOs are marketed to investors at attractive prices.

Pricing of IPOs is not trivial, and not all IPOs turn out to be underpriced. Some do poorly after issue. Facebook's 2012 IPO was a notable disappointment. Within a week of its IPO, Facebook's share price was 15\% below the 38 offer price, and five months later, its shares were selling at about half the offer price. (In the end, however, those who held on to their shares profited; within four years, the share price was well above 100.)

Other IPOs cannot even be fully sold to the market. Underwriters left with unmarketable securities are forced to sell them at a loss on the secondary market. Therefore, the investment banker bears price risk for an underwritten issue.

Interestingly, despite their typically attractive first-day returns (averaging over  $18\%$  between 1980 and 2020), IPOs have been poor long-term investments. Professor Jay Ritter, a leading expert in the field, has calculated the returns to a hypothetical investor buying equal amounts of each U.S. IPO between 1980 and 2019 at the close of trading on the first day the stock is listed and holding each position for three years. That portfolio underperforms the broad U.S. stock market by  $15.8\%$  for three-year holding periods and underperforms "style-matched" portfolios of firms with comparable size and ratio of book value to market value by  $5.2\%$ .

An interesting but little-used alternative to a traditional IPO is called a direct listing. In these transactions, existing shareholders can sell their shares to the public, but the company does not issue additional shares. Direct listings are used by companies that do not need to raise cash immediately but wish to become publicly traded so early investors can cash out their positions. Interest in direct listings was sparked by those of Spotify in 2018 and Slack in 2019. In 2021, SquareSpace, ZipRecruiter, and Coinbase were among the better-known listings.

Direct listings save companies the costs of an IPO. However, by forgoing an IPO, the firm forfeits some after-market support meant to stabilize post-issuance share prices. For example, underwriters usually set up lock-up periods that prohibit officers, directors, founders, and other pre-IPO investors from selling their shares for several months after the IPO. This prevents a wave of selling and presumably props up the stock price. To protect its own reputation as an underwriter, the investment bank may also purchase additional stock in the newly public firm to stabilize its price if it fears a post-IPO price decline.

# SPACs versus Traditional IPOs

While the IPOs we have described are the conventional way for firms to go public, 2021 was in large part the year of the SPAC: a special purpose acquisition company. The sponsor of the SPAC raises funds in its own IPO and goes public, but with no underlying commercial operations. It then searches for an acquisition target. If by the end of two years a suitable acquisition has not been found, the money must be returned to these early investors, typically hedge funds or other large institutional investors. But if the SPAC identifies an attractive target firm, it merges that firm into the already publicly traded SPAC. Of course, the ultimate acquisition is still unknown when the SPAC raises its own funds. For this reason, SPACs are often called blank-check firms. The reputation of the sponsor is therefore crucial.

The advantage of this model is that an attractive target can be taken public much faster, with less information disclosure, and at lower cost than in a traditional IPO. In addition, as an already publicly traded firm, the SPAC is allowed to make more extensive business projections than would be permitted for a firm engaged in a traditional IPO.

Usually, when the SPAC identifies its target, it raises additional funds to help finance the takeover. For example, Virgin Galactic was acquired by the SPAC Social Capital Hodosophia, which had previously raised  \$674 million. But the head of the SPAC invested an additional\$ 100 million in Virgin.

Founders and early investors in a SPAC usually receive special compensation. For example, they are granted options to buy additional shares of the merged firm at attractive prices. The sponsor of the SPAC also usually receives shares in the merged firm. Moreover, they have the right to withdraw their funds before a deal goes through, which limits their risk. The fraction of the firm offered to insiders at advantageous prices can be large, for example, as high as  $20\%$ . This means that the SPAC sponsors can make large profits even if the outside investors in the SPAC fare poorly.


Listings of new SPACs accounted for a bit more than half of the roughly 300 billion raised in IPOs in 2021. But while early investors have enjoyed generous returns on these vehicles, there appears to be growing unease with their performance for later investors. While there is not yet a lot of history to judge them by, they have so far underperformed the post-listing returns of conventional IPOs. On the other hand, "high-quality" SPACs, for example, those sponsored by large and presumably more knowledgeable private-equity firms, appear to have performed somewhat better.

Still, regulators, in particular the SEC, seem increasingly concerned about an uneven playing field for insiders versus regular investors. Gary Gensler, head of the SEC, has asked staff for recommendations concerning disclosure, marketing practices, and sponsor liability. Press releases that create buzz about a new offering without adhering to conventional standards for financial disclosure are a particular concern.

# 3.2 How Securities Are Traded

Financial markets develop to meet the needs of particular traders. Consider what would happen if organized markets did not exist. Any household wishing to invest in some type of financial asset would have to find others wishing to sell. Soon, venues where interested traders could meet would become popular. Eventually, financial markets would emerge from these meeting places. Thus, a pub in old London called Lloyd's launched the maritime insurance industry. A Manhattan curb on Wall Street became synonymous with the financial world.

# Types of Markets

We can differentiate four types of markets: direct search markets, brokered markets, dealer markets, and auction markets.

Direct Search Markets A direct search market is the least organized market. Buyers and sellers must seek each other out directly. An example of a transaction in such a market is the sale of old furniture where the seller advertises for buyers in a local newspaper or on Craigslist. Such markets are characterized by sporadic participation and nonstandard goods. Firms would find it difficult to profit by specializing in such an environment.

Brokered Markets The next level of organization is a brokered market. In markets where trading in a good is active, brokers find it profitable to offer search services to buyers and sellers. A good example is the real estate market, where economies of scale in searches for available homes and for prospective buyers make it worthwhile for participants to pay brokers to help them organize their searches. Brokers in particular markets develop specialized knowledge on valuing assets traded in that market.

The primary market, where new issues of securities are offered to the public, is another example of a brokered market. In the primary market, investment bankers who market a firm's securities to the public act as brokers; they seek investors to purchase securities directly from the issuing corporation.

Dealer Markets When trading activity in a particular type of asset increases, dealer markets arise. Dealers specialize in various assets, purchase these assets for their own accounts, and later sell them for a profit from their inventory. The spreads between dealers' buy (or "bid") prices and sell (or "ask") prices are a source of profit. Dealer markets save traders on search costs because market participants can easily look up the prices at which they can buy from or sell to dealers. A fair amount of market activity is required before dealing in a market is an attractive source of income. Most bonds and most foreign exchange trade in over-the-counter dealer markets.

Auction Markets The most integrated market is an auction market, in which all traders converge at one place (either physically or "electronically") to buy or sell an asset.

# Concept Check 3.2

Many assets trade in more than one type of market. What types of markets do the following trade in?

a. Used cars b. Paintings
c. Rare coins

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is an example of an auction market. An advantage of auction markets over dealer markets is that one need not search across dealers to find the best price for a good. If all participants converge, they can arrive at mutually agreeable prices and save the bid-ask spread.

Notice that both over-the-counter dealer markets and stock exchanges are secondary markets. They are organized for investors to trade existing securities among themselves.

# Types of Orders

Before comparing alternative trading practices and competing security markets, it is helpful to begin with an overview of the types of trades an investor might wish to have executed in these markets. Broadly speaking, there are two types of orders: market orders and orders contingent on price.

Market Orders Market orders are buy or sell orders that are to be executed immediately at current market prices. For example, our investor might call her broker and ask for the market price of Apple. The broker might report back that the best bid price is  \$179.50 and the best ask price is\$ 179.54, meaning that the investor would need to pay \$179.54 to purchase a share, and could receive \$179.50 a share if she wished to sell some of her own holdings. The bid-ask spread in this case is $.04. So an order to buy 100 shares "at market" would result in purchase at \$179.54, and an order to "sell at market" would be executed at 179.50.

This simple scenario is subject to a few potential complications. First, posted price quotes actually represent commitments to trade up to a specified number of shares. If the market order is for more than this number of shares, the order may be filled at multiple prices. For example, if the ask price is good for orders up to 300 shares and the investor wishes to purchase 500 shares, it may be necessary to pay a slightly higher price for the last 200 shares. Figure 3.3 shows average depth over time. Notice that depth is considerably higher for large stocks than it is for smaller stocks. Depth is considered another component of liquidity. Second, another trader may beat our investor to the quote, meaning that her order would then be executed at a worse price. Finally, the best price quote may change before her order arrives, again causing execution at a price different from the one quoted at the moment of the order.

Price-Contingent Orders Investors also may place orders specifying prices at which they are willing to buy or sell a security. A limit buy order may instruct the broker to buy

Panel B: Large stocks (above  $95^{\text{th}}$  percentile market capitalization) some number of shares if and when Apple may be obtained at or below a stipulated price. Conversely, a limit sell instructs the broker to sell if and when the stock price rises above a specified limit. A collection of limit orders waiting to be executed is called a limit order book.

Figure 3.4 is a portion of the limit order book for shares in Microsoft taken from the CBOE electronic exchange (one of several electronic exchanges; more on these shortly). Notice that the best orders are at the top of the list: the offers to buy at the highest price and to sell at the lowest price. The buy and sell orders at the top of the list— \$286.95 and\$ 286.97—are called the inside quotes; they are the highest buy and lowest sell orders. The inside spread at this time was only 2 cents. However, order sizes at the inside quotes are generally small. Therefore, investors interested in larger trades face an effective spread greater than the nominal one because they cannot execute their entire trades at the inside price quotes.

# Concept Check 3.3

What type of trading order might you give to your broker in each of the following circumstances?

a. You want to buy shares of Microsoft to diversify your portfolio. You believe the share price is approximately at the "fair" value, and you want the trade done quickly and cheaply.
b. You want to buy shares of Microsoft, but you believe that the current stock price is too high given the firm's prospects. If the shares could be obtained at a price  $5\%$  lower than the current value, you would like to purchase shares for your portfolio.
c. You believe your shares of Microsoft are already priced generously, and you are inclined to sell them. But there is a chance that price fluctuations might result in a short-lived increase of a few dollars per share. If the share price were to rise by 4, you are convinced that it would be greatly overpriced and you would want to sell it immediately.

# Trading Mechanisms

An investor who wishes to buy or sell shares will place an order with a brokerage firm. The broker charges a commission for arranging the trade on the client's behalf. Brokers have several avenues by which they can execute that trade, that is, find a buyer or seller and arrange for the shares to be exchanged.

Broadly speaking, there are three trading systems employed in the United States: over-the-counter dealer markets, electronic communication networks, and specialist/designated market maker (DMM) markets. Electronic trading is by far the most prevalent, but the best-known markets such as NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange actually use a variety of trading procedures, so before you delve into specific markets, it is useful to understand the basic operation of each type of trading system.


Dealer Markets Tens of thousands of securities trade on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Thousands of brokers register with the SEC as security dealers. Dealers quote prices at which they are willing to buy or sell securities. A broker then executes a trade by contacting a dealer listing an attractive quote.

Before 1971, all OTC quotations were recorded manually and published daily on so-called pink sheets. In 1971, the National Association of Securities Dealers introduced its Automatic Quotations System, or NASDAQ, to link brokers and dealers in a computer network where price quotes could be displayed and revised. Dealers could use the network to display the bid price at which they were willing to purchase a security and the ask price at which they were willing to sell. The difference in these prices, the bid-ask spread, was the source of the dealer's profit. Brokers representing clients could examine quotes over the computer network, contact the dealer with the best quote, and execute a trade.

As originally organized, NASDAQ was more of a price-ration system than a trading system. While brokers could survey bid and ask prices across the network of dealers in the search for the best trading opportunity, actual trades required direct negotiation (often over the phone) between the investor's broker and the dealer in the security. However, as we will see, NASDAQ is no longer a mere price quotation system. While dealers still post bid and ask prices over the network, what is now called the NASDAQ Stock Market allows for automated electronic execution of trades, and the vast majority of trades are executed electronically.

Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) Electronic communication networks (ECNs) allow participants to post market and limit orders over computer networks. The limit-order book is available to all participants. An example of such an order book from CBOE Global Markets appears in Figure 3.4. Orders that can be "crossed," that is, matched against another order, are executed automatically without requiring the intervention of a broker. For example, an order to buy a share at a price of  \$50 or lower will be immediately executed if there is an outstanding ask price of\$ 50. Therefore, ECNs are true trading systems, not merely price-ration systems.

ECNs register with the SEC as broker-dealers and are subject to Regulation ATS (for Alternative Trading System). ECN subscribers, who can bring trades directly to the network, are typically institutional investors, broker-dealers, and market makers (firms that post bid and ask prices for securities and commit to trading a specified number of shares at currently posted prices). Individual investors therefore must hire a broker who is a participant in the ECN to execute trades on their behalf.

ECNs offer several advantages. Trades are automatically crossed at a modest cost, typically less than a penny per share. ECNs are attractive as well because of the speed with which a trade can be executed. Finally, these systems offer traders considerable anonymity.

Specialist/DMM Markets A market maker is a trader that quotes both a bid and an ask price to the public. By standing ready to trade at those publicly quoted prices, market makers provide liquidity to other traders, allowing them to move into and out of share positions quickly and cheaply.

A designated market maker (DMM) is a market maker that accepts the obligation to commit its own capital to provide quotes and help maintain a "fair and orderly market." The exchange's DMM is the official market maker for a particular security. For example, when the book of limit orders is so thin that the spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price becomes too wide, the DMM would be expected to post bid and ask prices at a narrower spread, offering to buy and sell shares from its own inventory. Similarly, DMMs are expected to offer trades that support the "weak" side of the market when there are imbalances in buy and sell orders. The trades that a DMM makes from or for its own inventory contribute to market depth, and DMM depth guidelines specify their obligation to support the market in this manner.

Designated market makers replaced what formerly were called specialist firms at the NYSE. In return for assuming their obligations, DMMs are given some advantages in trade execution. However, unlike the specialist firms that they replaced, they are not given advanced looks at the trading orders of other market participants.

While most trading on the NYSE is electronic, the exchange touts the DMM system as offering a when-needed level of human intervention to maintain a smooth functioning market during periods of stress and high volatility. These services are most valuable at market open and close, when both trading volume and price volatility are highest.

# 3.3 The Rise of Electronic Trading

When first established, NASDAQ was primarily an over-the-counter dealer market and the NYSE was a specialist market. But today both are primarily electronic markets. These changes were driven by an interaction of new technologies and new regulations. New regulations allowed brokers to compete for business, broke the hold that dealers once had on information about best-available bid and ask prices, forced integration of markets, and allowed securities to trade in ever-smaller price increments (called tick sizes). Technology made it possible for traders to rapidly compare prices across markets and direct their trades to the markets with the best prices. The resulting competition drove down the cost of trade execution to a tiny fraction of its level just a few decades ago.

In 1975, fixed commissions on the NYSE were eliminated, which freed brokers to compete for business by lowering their fees. In that year also, Congress amended the Securities Exchange Act to create the National Market System to at least partially centralize trading across exchanges and enhance competition among different market makers. The idea was to implement centralized reporting of transactions as well as a centralized price quotation system to give traders a broader view of trading opportunities across markets.

The aftermath of a 1994 scandal at NASDAQ turned out to be a major impetus in the further evolution and integration of markets. NASDAQ dealers were found to be colluding to maintain wide bid-ask spreads. For example, if a stock was listed at  $30 bid-$ 30½ ask, a retail client who wished to buy shares from a dealer would pay  $\$30 \frac{1}{2}$  while a client who wished to sell shares would receive only  $\$30$ . The dealer would pocket the  $\frac{1}{2}$ -point spread as profit. Other traders may have been willing to step in with better prices (e.g., they may have been willing to buy shares for  $\$30 \frac{1}{8}$  or sell them for  $\$30 \frac{3}{8}$ ), but those better quotes were not made available to the public, enabling dealers to profit from artificially wide spreads at the public's expense. When these practices came to light, an antitrust lawsuit was brought against NASDAQ.

In response to the scandal, the SEC instituted new order-handling rules. Published dealer quotes now had to reflect limit orders of customers, allowing them to effectively compete with dealers to capture trades. As part of the antitrust settlement, NASDAQ agreed to integrate quotes from ECNs into its public display, enabling the electronic exchanges to also compete for trades. Shortly after this settlement, the SEC adopted Regulation ATS (Alternative Trading Systems), giving ECNs the right to register as stock exchanges. Not surprisingly, they captured an ever-larger market share, and in the wake of this new competition, bid-ask spreads narrowed.


Even more dramatic narrowing of trading costs came in 1997, when the SEC allowed the minimum tick size to fall from one-eighth of a dollar to one-sixteenth. Not long after, in 2001, "decimalization" allowed the tick size to fall to 1 cent. Bid-ask spreads again fell dramatically. Figure 3.5 shows estimates of the "effective spread" (the cost of a transaction) during three distinct time periods defined by the minimum tick size. Notice how dramatically effective spread falls along with the minimum tick size. By 2015, quoted bid-ask spreads on large stocks were typically only 1 cent. Across all stocks, the median spread was about 5 cents.

Technology was also changing trading practices. The first ECN, Instinet, was established in 1969. By the 1990s, exchanges around the world were rapidly adopting fully electronic trading systems. Europe led the way in this evolution, but eventually American exchanges followed suit. The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) spun off the NASDAQ Stock Market as a separate entity in 2000, which quickly evolved into a centralized limit-order matching system—effectively a large ECN. The NYSE acquired the electronic Archipelago Exchange in 2006 and renamed it NYSE Arca.

In 2005, the SEC adopted Regulation NMS (for National Market System), which was fully implemented in 2007. The goal was to link exchanges electronically, thereby creating, in effect, one integrated electronic market. The regulation required exchanges to honor quotes of other exchanges when they could be executed automatically. An exchange that could not handle a quote electronically would be labeled a "slow market" under Reg NMS and could be ignored by other market participants. The NYSE, which was still devoted to the specialist system, was particularly at risk of being passed over, and in response to this pressure, it moved aggressively toward automated execution of trades. Electronic trading networks and the integration of markets in the wake of Reg NMS made it much easier for exchanges around the world to compete; the NYSE lost its effective monopoly in the trading of its own listed stocks, and by the end of the decade, its share in the trading of NYSE-listed stocks fell from about  $75\%$  to  $20\%$ .

Trading today is overwhelmingly electronic, at least for stocks. Bonds are still traded in more traditional dealer markets.

# 3.4 U.S. Markets

The NYSE and the NASDAQ Stock Market remain the best-known U.S. stock markets. But electronic communication networks have steadily increased their market share. Figure 3.6 shows the comparative trading volume of NYSE-listed shares on the NYSE and NASDAQ as well as on the major ECNs, namely, BATS, NYSE Arca, and Direct Edge. (Since this study was published, BATS and Direct Edge merged, creating one of the world's largest stock exchanges, called BATS Global Markets, which was, in turn, acquired by the CBOE.)

The "Other" category, which now approximates  $40\%$ , includes so-called dark pools and "internalization" of order flow by brokerage firms, both of which we will discuss shortly.

# NASDAQ

The NASDAQ Stock Market lists around 3,000 firms. It has steadily introduced ever-more sophisticated trading platforms, which today handle the great majority of its trades. Its NASDAQ Market Center consolidates NASDAQ's previous electronic markets into one integrated system. NASDAQ merged in 2007 with OMX, a Swedish-Finnish company that controls seven Nordic and Baltic stock exchanges, to form NASDAQ OMX Group. In addition to maintaining the NASDAQ Stock Market, it also maintains several stock markets in Europe as well as an options and futures exchange in the U.S.

NASDAQ has three levels of subscribers. The highest, level 3 subscribers, are registered market makers. These are firms that make a market in securities, maintain inventories of securities, and post bid and ask prices at which they commit to buy or sell shares. Level 3 subscribers can enter and change bid-ask quotes continually and have the fastest execution of trades. They profit from the spread between bid and ask prices.

Level 2 subscribers receive all bid and ask quotes but cannot enter their own quotes. They can see which market makers are offering the best prices. These subscribers tend to be brokerage firms that execute trades for clients but do not actively deal in stocks for their own account.

Level 1 subscribers receive only inside quotes (i.e., the best bid and ask prices) but do not see how many shares are being offered. These subscribers tend to be investors who are not actively buying or selling but want information on current prices.

# The New York Stock Exchange

The NYSE is the largest U.S. stock exchange as measured by the market value of listed stocks. Daily trading volume on the NYSE commonly exceeds 3 billion shares.

In 2006, the NYSE merged with the Archipelago Exchange to form a publicly held company called the NYSE Group, and then in 2007, it merged with the European exchange Euronext to form NYSE Euronext. The firm acquired the American Stock Exchange in 2008, which was renamed NYSE Amex and focuses on small firms. NYSE Arca is the firm's electronic communications network, and this is where the bulk of exchange-traded funds trade. In 2013, NYSE Euronext was purchased by InternationalExchange (ICE). ICE has retained the NYSE Euronext name.

The NYSE was long committed to its specialist trading system, which relied heavily on human participation in trade execution. It began its transition to electronic trading for smaller trades in 1976 with the introduction of its DOT (Designated Order Turnaround), and later SuperDOT, systems, which could route orders directly to the specialist. In 2000, the exchange launched Direct+, which could automatically cross smaller trades (up to 1,099 shares) without human intervention, and in 2004, it began eliminating the size restrictions on Direct+ trades. The change of emphasis dramatically accelerated in 2006 with the introduction of the NYSE Hybrid Market, which allowed brokers to send orders either for immediate electronic execution or to the specialist, who could seek price improvement from another trader. The Hybrid system allowed the NYSE to qualify as a fast market for the purposes of Regulation NMS, but still offer the advantages of human intervention for more complicated trades. In contrast, NYSE's Arca marketplace is fully electronic.

# ECNs

Over time, more fully automated markets have gained market share at the expense of less automated ones, in particular, the NYSE. Brokers that have an affiliation with an ECN have computer access and can enter orders in the limit order book. As orders are received, the system determines whether there is a matching order, and if so, the trade is immediately crossed.


Originally, ECNs were open only to other traders using the same system. But following the implementation of Reg NMS, ECNs began listing limit orders on other networks. Traders could use their computer systems to sift through the limit order books of many ECNs and instantaneously route orders to the market with the best prices. Those cross-market links have become the impetus for one of the more popular strategies of so-called high-frequency traders, which seek to profit from even small, transitory discrepancies in prices across markets. Speed is obviously of the essence here, and ECNs compete in terms of the speed they can offer. Latency refers to the time it takes to accept, process, and deliver a trading order. For example, CBOE Global Markets, which acquired the BATS platform, advertises average latency times of around 100 microseconds (i.e., .0001 second).

# 3.5 New Trading Strategies

The marriage of electronic trading mechanisms with computer technology has had far-ranging impacts on trading strategies and tools. Algorithmic trading delegates trading decisions to computer programs. High-frequency trading is a special class of algorithmic trading in which computer programs initiate orders in tiny fractions of a second, far faster than any human could process the information driving the trade. Much of the market liquidity that once was provided by brokers making a market in a security has been displaced by these high-frequency traders. But when high-frequency traders abandon the market, as in the so-called flash crash of 2010, liquidity can likewise evaporate in a flash. Dark pools are trading venues that preserve anonymity, but also affect market liquidity. We will address these emerging issues later in this section.

# Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic trading is the use of computer programs to make trading decisions. Well more than half of all equity volume in the United States is believed to be initiated by computer algorithms. Many of these trades exploit very small discrepancies in security prices and entail numerous and rapid cross-market price comparisons that are well suited to computer analysis. These strategies would not have been feasible before decimalization of the minimum tick size.

Some algorithmic trades attempt to exploit very-short-term trends (as short as a few seconds or less) as new information about a firm, or, more controversially, about the intentions of other traders, becomes available. Others use versions of pairs trading in which normal price relations between pairs (or larger groups) of stocks seem temporarily disrupted and offer small profit opportunities as they move back into alignment. Still others attempt to exploit discrepancies between stock prices and prices of stock-index futures contracts.

Some algorithmic trading involves activities akin to traditional market making. The traders seek to profit from the bid-ask spread by buying a stock at the bid price and rapidly selling it at the ask price before the price can change. While this mimics the role of a market maker who provides liquidity to other traders in the stock, these algorithmic traders are not registered market makers and so do not have an affirmative obligation to maintain both bid and ask quotes. If they abandon a market during a period of turbulence, the shock to market liquidity can be disruptive. This seems to have been

At 2:42 New York time on May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was already down about 300 points for the day. The market was demonstrating concerns about the European debt crisis, and nerves were on edge. Then, in the next 5 minutes, the Dow dropped an additional 600 points. And only 20 minutes after that, it had recovered most of those 600 points. Besides the staggering intraday volatility of the broad market, trading in individual shares and ETFs was even more disrupted. The iShares Russell 1000 Value fund temporarily fell from  \$59 a share to 8 cents. Shares in the large consulting company Accenture, which had just sold for\$ 38, traded at 1 cent only a minute or two later. At the other extreme, price quotes for Apple and Hewlett-Packard momentarily increased to over 100,000. These markets were clearly broken.

The causes of the flash crash are still debated. An SEC report issued after the trade pointed to a 4 billion sale of market index futures contracts by a mutual fund. As market prices began to tumble, many algorithmic trading programs withdrew from the markets, and those that remained became net sellers, further pushing down equity prices. As more and more of these algorithmic traders shut down, liquidity in these markets evaporated: Buyers for many stocks simply disappeared.

Finally, trading was halted for a short period. When it resumed, buyers decided to take advantage of many severely depressed stock prices, and the market rebounded almost as quickly as it had crashed. Given the intraday turbulence and the clearly distorted prices at which some trades had been executed, the NYSE and NASDAQ decided to cancel all trades that were executed more than  $60\%$  away from a "reference price" close to the opening price of the day. Almost  $70\%$  of those canceled trades involved ETFs.


The SEC has since experimented with new circuit breakers to halt trading during periods of "excessive" volatility. The idea is to prevent trading algorithms from moving share prices quickly before human traders have a chance to determine whether those prices are moving in response to fundamental information.

Currently, various thresholds set off market halts of varying duration. For example, a  $7\%$  decline in the S&P 500 (before 3:25 p.m.) halts trading for 15 minutes whereas a  $20\%$  decline halts trading for the remainder of the day. In addition a limit-up, limit-down rule prevents individual stocks from trading outside of time-varying price bands determined by percentage spreads (for example,  $5\%$  or  $10\%$  depending on the security) above or below the average security price in the preceding five-minute period.

The flash crash highlighted the fragility of markets in the face of huge variation in trading volume created by algorithmic traders. The potential for these high-frequency traders to withdraw from markets in periods of turbulence remains a concern, and many observers are not convinced that we are protected from future flash crashes.

a problem during the flash crash of May 6, 2010, when the stock market encountered extreme volatility, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling by 1,000 points before recovering around 600 points in intraday trading. The nearby box discusses this amazing and troubling episode.

# High-Frequency Trading

It is easy to see that many algorithmic trading strategies require extremely rapid trade initiation and execution. High-frequency trading is a subset of algorithmic trading that relies on computer programs to make extremely rapid decisions. High-frequency traders compete for trades that offer very small profits. But if those opportunities are numerous enough, they can accumulate to big money.

We pointed out that one high-frequency strategy entails a sort of market making, attempting to profit from the bid-ask spread. Another relies on cross-market arbitrage, in which even tiny price discrepancies across markets allow the firm to buy a security at one price and simultaneously sell it at a slightly higher price. The competitive advantage in these strategies lies with the firms that are quickest to identify and execute these profit opportunities. There is a tremendous premium on being the first to "hit" a bid or ask price.

Other strategies combine artificial intelligence with high-speed trading. For example, some hedge firms use electronic news feeds along with natural language processing. They can compare earnings (or other) announcements to consensus forecasts to infer the "good" or "bad" nature of news about a firm. The hope is to be the first to trade on the announcement—which requires the program to receive, interpret, and act on the announcement faster than any human could. Another strategy might be dubbed "electronic front running," where the fund uses artificial intelligence along with trading data to infer buy/sell programs of other traders and to buy or sell ahead of them before their trades move market prices.


Trade execution times for high-frequency traders are now measured in milliseconds, even microseconds. This has induced trading firms to "co-locate" their trading centers next to the computer systems of the electronic exchanges. When execution or latency periods are less than a millisecond, the extra time it takes for a trade order to travel from a remote location to a New York exchange would be enough to make it nearly impossible to win the trade.

To understand why co-location has become a key issue, consider this calculation. Even light can travel only 186 miles in one millisecond, so an order originating in Chicago transmitted at the speed of light would take almost five milliseconds to reach New York. But ECNs today claim latency periods considerably less than one millisecond, so an order from Chicago could not possibly compete with one launched from a co-located facility.

In some ways, co-location is a new version of an old phenomenon. Think about why, even before the advent of the telephone, so many brokerage firms originally located their headquarters in New York: They were "co-locating" with the NYSE so that their brokers could bring trades (on foot!) to the exchange quickly and efficiently. Today, trades are transmitted electronically, but competition among traders for fast execution means that the need to be near the market (now embodied in computer servers) remains.

# Dark Pools

Many large traders seek anonymity. They fear that if others see them executing a large buy or sell program, their intentions will become public and prices will move against them. This is a particular concern with large orders that will be executed over time using several trades. Very large trades (called blocks, usually defined as a trade of more than 10,000 shares) traditionally were brought to "block houses," brokerage firms specializing in matching block buyers and sellers. Part of the expertise of block brokers is in identifying traders who might be interested in a large purchase or sale if given an offer. These brokers discreetly arrange large trades out of the public eye, and so avoid moving prices against their clients.

Block trading today has been largely displaced by dark pools, private trading systems in which participants can buy or sell large blocks of securities without showing their hand. Limit orders are not visible to the general public as they would be on a conventional exchange, and traders' identities can also be kept private. Trades are not reported until after they are crossed, which limits the vulnerability to other traders anticipating one's trading program.

Rather than cross limit orders, many dark pools simply accept "unpriced orders" and match buyers with sellers at the midpoint of the bid and ask prices reported on other markets. These orders are therefore somewhat like market orders. However, because these orders never appear in the consolidated limit order book (displaying so-called national best bid and offer, or NBBO, prices), they do not contribute to "price discovery," that is, help the price reflect all publicly available information about demand for the security. For this reason, dark pools have been criticized as exacerbating the fragmentation of markets.

Many large traders gravitate toward dark pools because it makes them less vulnerable to high-frequency traders. They want a trading venue where other traders find it more difficult to infer their trading intentions and trade in front of them. Many dark pools claim to exclude better-informed traders such as hedge funds. However, this ideal has not always been realized. In 2011, Pipeline LLC, which operated a dark pool, was accused of enabling high-frequency traders to participate in its market and to gauge the intentions of other participants in the pool. Similarly, in 2014, Barclays was accused of misrepresenting the level of high-frequency trading in a dark pool that it operated. There are lingering concerns regarding the extent to which dark pools provide the protections from other traders that they are purportedly designed to offer.


Another approach to dealing with large trades is to split them into many small trades, each of which can be executed on electronic markets, attempting to hide the fact that the total number of shares ultimately to be bought or sold is large. This trend has led to rapid decline in average trade size; while average trade size in 2004 was about 1,000 shares, today it is only about 200 shares.

# Internalization

In addition to dark pools, order internalization represents a second major drain of trades away from exchanges. This refers to the practice by brokers of matching buy and sell orders internally rather than bringing them to exchanges. By so doing, the brokerage captures the bid-ask spread for itself and, in addition, avoids paying exchange access fees. These are fees charged by exchanges for so-called maker/taker pricing. Market orders that "take" liquidity (i.e., access the limit order book) pay an access fee of about .3 cents per share, while limit orders that provide or "make" liquidity for market orders receive a rebate of .2 cents per share. (The exchange gets the other .1 cent.) Brokers thus can profit from their customers' order flow. As Figure 3.6 illustrates, the share of trading that now occurs off exchanges (the Other category in the figure), now accounts for about  $40\%$  of trades and creates concerns that market fragmentation means that market prices may not reflect the full picture of supply and demand for a stock.

# Bond Trading

In 2006, the NYSE obtained regulatory approval to expand its bond-trading system to include the debt issues of any NYSE-listed firm. Until then, each bond needed to be registered before listing, and such a requirement was too onerous to justify listing most bonds. In conjunction with these new listings, the NYSE has expanded its electronic bond-trading platform.

Nevertheless, the vast majority of bond trading occurs in the OTC market among bond dealers, even for bonds that are actually listed on the NYSE. This market is a network of bond dealers such as Merrill Lynch (now part of Bank of America), Salomon Smith Barney (a division of Citigroup), and Goldman Sachs that is linked by a computer quotation system. However, because these dealers do not carry extensive inventories of the wide range of bonds that have been issued to the public, they cannot necessarily offer to sell bonds from their inventory to clients or even buy bonds for their own inventory.

New electronic trading platforms, for example, MarketAxess, now exist to directly connect buyers and sellers. But these platforms have not yet displaced the traditional dealer market. One of the impediments to heavy electronic trading is lack of standardization in the bond market. A single company may have outstanding dozens of different bond issues, differing by coupon, maturity, and seniority. Any one of these bonds may trade only a few times a year. Given the great diversity of bond issues and the often sporadic trading activity of bond investors, even these electronic platforms rely for liquidity on participation by investment banks that are willing to act as dealers, maintaining inventories to be matched against investor orders. In the aftermath of the financial crisis and reduced capacity for risk taking, however, banks have pulled back from this role. In practice, therefore, the corporate bond market often is quite "thin," in that there may be few investors interested in trading a specific bond at any particular time. As a result, the bond market is subject to a type of liquidity risk, for it can be difficult to sell one's holdings quickly if the need arises.

# 3.6 Globalization of Stock Markets

Figure 3.7 shows the market capitalization of firms listed on major stock exchanges around the world. By this measure, the NYSE Euronext is the largest equity market. All major stock markets today are effectively electronic.

Securities markets have come under increasing pressure in recent years to make international alliances or mergers. Much of this pressure is due to the impact of electronic trading. To a growing extent, traders view stock markets as computer networks that link them to other traders, and there are increasingly fewer limits on the securities around the world that they can trade. Against this background, it becomes more important for exchanges to provide the cheapest and most efficient mechanism by which trades can be executed and cleared. This argues for global alliances that can facilitate the nuts and bolts of cross-border trading and benefit from economies of scale. Exchanges feel that they eventually need to offer 24-hour global markets and platforms that allow trading of different security types, for example, both stocks and derivatives. Finally, companies want to be able to go beyond national borders when they wish to raise capital.

These pressures have resulted in a broad trend toward market consolidation. After a wave of mergers in the last two decades, the industry now has a few giant security exchanges: ICE (Intercontinental Exchange, operating NYSE Euronext and several commodity futures and options markets), NASDAQ, the LSE (London Stock Exchange Group), Deutsche Boerse, the CME Group (largely options and futures trading), TSE (Tokyo Stock Exchange), and HKEX (Hong Kong Stock Exchange).

# 3.7 Trading Costs

Part of the cost of trading a security is obvious and explicit. Your broker must be paid a commission. Individuals may choose from two kinds of brokers: full-service or discount. Full-service brokers who provide a variety of services often are referred to as account executives or financial consultants.

Besides carrying out the basic services of executing orders, holding securities for safekeeping, extending margin loans, and facilitating short sales, brokers routinely provide information and advice relating to investment alternatives.

Full-service brokers usually depend on a research staff that prepares analyses and forecasts of general economic as well as industry and company conditions and often makes specific buy or sell recommendations. Some customers take the ultimate leap of faith and allow a full-service broker to make buy and sell decisions for them by establishing a discretionary account, which allows the broker to trade securities whenever deemed fit. (The broker cannot withdraw any funds, though.) This action requires an unusual degree of trust on the part of the customer, for an unscrupulous broker can "churn" an account, that is, trade securities excessively with the sole purpose of generating commissions.

Discount brokers, on the other hand, provide "no-frills" services. They buy and sell securities, hold them for safekeeping, offer margin loans, and facilitate short sales—that is all. The only information they provide about the securities they handle is price quotations. Discount brokerage services have become increasingly available in recent years. Many banks, thrift institutions, and mutual fund management companies now offer such services to the investing public as part of a general trend toward the creation of one-stop "financial supermarkets."

Stock trading fees have fallen steadily and dramatically in the last three decades. In fact, several brokerage firms, among them Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade (which was acquired by Schwab in 2020), E*Trade, Fidelity, and Vanguard, have reduced their trading commissions to zero. What then is their profit model? To a large extent, online brokers typically earn considerably more interest than they pay to customers on the funds kept in brokerage accounts. They also may hope to establish relationships with customers who will pay for financial advice. By 2020, commissions accounted for less than  $10\%$  of revenues at Schwab.

Finally, brokers generate income from payment for order flow. This entails passing along customers' orders for execution to high-frequency traders who are willing to pay for those orders because it gives them the opportunity to profit from the bid-ask spread. Payment for order flow is controversial because it potentially presents a conflict of interest for brokers, who might be tempted to sell an order for payment rather than work for the best execution of the trade. On the other hand, it is plausible that at least some of the payment for order flow is passed along to retail customers in the form of lower commissions, and that this practice may be responsible for part of the dramatic reduction in brokerage fees in the last few decades. Moreover, firms engaging in payment for order flow point out that SEC rules prohibit purchasers of order flow from executing trades at prices worse than the national best bid or offer prices available on exchanges, so they argue that investors are not hurt by the practice.

As payment for order flow would suggest, in addition to the explicit part of trading costs—the broker's commission—there is an implicit part—the dealer's bid-ask spread. The spread can range from just a cent or so for the largest stocks, to about 5 cents for average-sized stocks, to considerably more for small stocks. The spread is the main source of profit to dealers in the stock, who advertise their willingness to buy from the public at the

(lower) bid price and sell at the (higher) ask price. More heavily traded stocks, where dealers can unwind positions easily and cheaply, command smaller spreads. But beyond that, there is an important information story that explains why larger, better-known companies enjoy smaller spreads.

Dealers who post bid or ask prices are vulnerable to a type of adverse selection problem: if their posted prices are too low, for example, they will receive many buy orders and sell their shares at bargain prices. In other words, they will attract the most trading interest exactly when their posted prices are wrong. Even if their posted prices are initially "correct," they are vulnerable to information events that can quickly make those prices out of date. The dealer has effectively issued a free option to other traders to initiate a trade only when it is advantageous to them. The dealer thus has to trade off the profit from the bid-ask spread against the expected loss from dealing with more sophisticated traders who can take advantage of misaligned price quotes.

Thus, we would expect to see that well-known stocks, for which information is abundant, have lower spreads. Smaller, lesser-known, and less-researched stocks, which are subject to larger potential shocks from previously unanticipated information releases, should have higher spreads. And that is exactly what we observe in the marketplace.

Another implicit cost of trading that some observers would distinguish is the price concession an investor may be forced to make for trading in quantities greater than those associated with the posted bid or ask price.

# 3.8 Buying on Margin

When purchasing securities, investors have easy access to a source of debt financing called broker's call loans. Taking advantage of these loans is called buying on margin.

Purchasing stocks on margin means the investor borrows part of the purchase price. The margin in the account is the portion of the purchase price contributed by the investor; the remainder is borrowed from the broker. The brokers in turn borrow money from banks at the call money rate to finance these purchases; they then charge their clients that rate (defined in Chapter 2), plus a service charge. All securities purchased on margin must be maintained with the brokerage firm in street name, for the securities are collateral for the loan.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System limits the extent to which stock purchases can be financed using margin loans. The initial margin requirement is  $50\%$ , meaning that at least  $50\%$  of the purchase price must be paid for in cash, with the rest borrowed.

# Example 3.1 Margin

The percentage margin is defined as the ratio of the net worth, or the "equity value," of the account to the market value of the securities. To illustrate, suppose an investor initially pays \$6,000 toward the purchase of \$10,000 worth of stock (100 shares at \$100 per share), borrowing the remaining \$4,000 from a broker. The initial balance sheet looks like this:

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities and Owners’ Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Value of stock</td><td>\$10,000</td><td>Loan from broker</td><td>\$4,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Equity</td><td>6,000</td></tr></table>

The initial percentage margin is

$$
\text {Margin} = \frac {\text {Equity in account}}{\text {Value of stock}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 6 , 0 0 0}{\mathbb {S} 1 0 , 0 0 0} = . 6 0, \text {or} 6 0
$$

If the price declines to 70 per share, the account balance becomes

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities and Owners’ Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Value of stock</td><td>\$7,000</td><td>Loan from broker</td><td>\$4,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Equity</td><td>3,000</td></tr></table>

The assets in the account fall by the full decrease in the stock value, as does the equity. The percentage margin is now

$$
\text {M a r g i n} = \frac {\text {E q u i t y i n a c c o u n t}}{\text {V a l u e o f s t o c k}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 3 , 0 0 0}{\mathbb {S} 7 , 0 0 0} = . 4 3, \text {o r} 4 3
$$

If the stock value in Example 3.1 were to fall below 4,000, owners' equity would become negative, meaning the value of the stock would no longer provide sufficient collateral to cover the loan from the broker. To guard against this possibility, the broker sets a maintenance margin. If the percentage margin falls below the maintenance level, the broker will issue a margin call, which requires the investor to add new cash or securities to the margin account. If the investor does not act, the broker may sell securities from the account to pay off enough of the loan to restore the percentage margin to an acceptable level.

# Example 3.2 Maintenance Margin

Continuing the scenario presented in Example 3.1, suppose the maintenance margin is  $30\%$ . How far could the stock price fall before the investor would get a margin call?

Let  $P$  be the price of the stock. The value of the investor's 100 shares is then 100P, and the equity in the account is 100P - \$4,000. The percentage margin is (100P - \$4,000)/100P. The price at which the percentage margin equals the maintenance margin of .3 is found by solving the equation

$$
\frac {1 0 0 P - 4 , 0 0 0}{1 0 0 P} = . 3
$$ which implies that  $P = \$57.14$ . If the price of the stock falls below  $\$57.14$  per share, the investor will receive a margin call.

Suppose the maintenance margin in Example 3.2 is  $40\%$ . How far can the stock price fall before the investor gets a margin call?

The following Excel spreadsheet, available in Connect or through your course instructor, makes it easy to analyze the impacts of different margin levels and the volatility of stock prices. It also allows you to compare return on investment for a margin trade with a trade using no borrowed funds.

Why do investors buy securities on margin? They do so when they wish to invest an amount greater than their own money allows. Thus, they can achieve greater upside potential, but they also expose themselves to greater downside risk.

To see how, let's suppose an investor is bullish on FinCorp stock, which is selling for  \$100 per share. An investor with\$ 10,000 to invest expects FinCorp to go up in price by 30\% during the next year. Ignoring dividends, the expected rate of return would be 30\% if the investor invested 10,000 to buy 100 shares.

But now assume the investor borrows another  \$10,000 from the broker and invests it in FinCorp, too. The total investment would be\$ 20,000 (for 200 shares). Assuming an interest rate on the margin loan of 9\% per year, what will the investor's rate of return be (again ignoring dividends) if the stock price increases 30\% by year's end?

The 200 shares will be worth  \$26,000. Paying off\$ 10,900 of principal and interest on the margin loan leaves $15,100 (i.e., $26,000 - 10,900). The rate of return in this case will be

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 15 , 100 - \mathbb {S} 10 , 000}{\mathbb {S} 10 , 000} = 51 \%
$$

<table><tr><td>Change in Stock Price</td><td>End-of-Year Value of Shares</td><td>Repayment of Principal and Interest*</td><td>Investor&#x27;s Rate of Return</td></tr><tr><td>30\% increase</td><td>$26,000</td><td>$10,900</td><td>51\%</td></tr><tr><td>No change</td><td>20,000</td><td>10,900</td><td>-9</td></tr><tr><td>30\% decrease</td><td>14,000</td><td>10,900</td><td>-69</td></tr></table>

* Assuming the investor buys \$20,000 worth of stock, borrowing \$10,000 of the purchase price at an interest rate of 9\% per year.

# Table 3.1

Illustration of buying stock on margin

The investor has parlayed a  $30\%$  rise in the stock's price into a  $51\%$  rate of return on the 10,000 investment.

Doing so, however, magnifies the downside risk. Suppose that, instead of going up by 30\%, the stock price drops by 30\% to \$70 per share. In that case, the 200 shares will be worth \$14,000, and the investor is left with \$3,100 after paying off the \$10,900 of principal and interest on the loan. The result is a disastrous return of

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 3 , 100 - \mathbb {S} 10 , 000}{\mathbb {S} 10 , 000} = - 69 \%
$$

Table 3.1 summarizes the possible results of these hypothetical transactions. If there is no change in the stock price, the investor loses  $9\%$ , the cost of the loan.

# Concept Check 3.5

Suppose that in the FinCorp example, the investor borrows only 5,000 at the same interest rate of 9 \%per year. What will the rate of return be if the stock price increases by 30 \%? If it falls by 30 \%? If it remains unchanged?

# 3.9 Short Sales

Normally, an investor would first buy a stock and later sell it. With a short sale, the order is reversed. First, you sell and then you buy the shares. In both cases, you begin and end with no shares.

A short sale allows investors to profit from a decline in a security's price. An investor borrows a share of stock from a broker and sells it. Later, the short-seller must purchase a share of the same stock in order to replace the one that was borrowed. This is called covering the short position. Table 3.2 compares stock purchases to short sales.

# Table 3.2

Cash flows from purchasing versus short-selling shares of stock

<table><tr><td colspan="3">Purchase of Stock</td></tr><tr><td>Time</td><td>Action</td><td>Cash Flow*</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Buy share</td><td>– Initial price</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Receive dividend, sell share</td><td>Ending price + Dividend</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Profit = (Ending price + Dividend) – Initial price</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Short Sale of Stock</td></tr><tr><td>Time</td><td>Action</td><td>Cash Flow*</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Borrow share; sell it</td><td>+ Initial price</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Repay dividend and buy share to replace the share originally borrowed</td><td>– (Ending price + Dividend)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Profit = Initial price – (Ending price + Dividend)</td></tr></table>

$^{*}$ A negative cash flow implies a cash outflow.

The short-seller anticipates the stock price will fall, so that the share can be purchased later at a lower price than it initially sold for; if so, the short-seller will reap a profit. Short-sellers must not only replace the shares but also pay the lender of the security any dividends paid during the short sale.

In practice, the shares loaned out for a short sale are typically provided by the short-seller's brokerage firm, which holds a wide variety of securities of its other investors in street name (i.e., the broker holds the shares registered in its own name on behalf of the client). The owner of the shares need not know that the shares have been lent to the short-seller. If the owner wishes to sell the shares, the brokerage firm will simply borrow shares from another investor. Therefore, the short sale may have an indefinite term. However, if the brokerage firm cannot locate new shares to replace the ones sold, the short-seller will need to repay the loan immediately by purchasing shares in the market and turning them over to the brokerage house to close out the loan. The short seller is at risk if the shares are not readily available, as shorts in GameStop painfully learned in 2021. See the nearby box.

Finally, exchange rules require that proceeds from a short sale must be kept on account with the broker. The short-seller cannot invest these funds to generate income, although large or institutional investors typically will receive some income from the proceeds of a short sale being held with the broker. Short-sellers also are required to post margin (cash or collateral) with the broker to cover losses should the stock price rise during the short sale.

# Example 3.3 Short Sales

To illustrate the mechanics of short-selling, suppose you are bearish (pessimistic) on Dot Bomb stock, and its market price is 100 per share. You tell your broker to sell short 1,000 shares. The broker borrows 1,000 shares either from another customer's account or from another broker.

The  $\$ 100,000$ cash proceeds from the short sale are credited to your account. Suppose the broker has a  $50 \%$ margin requirement on short sales. This means you must have other cash or securities in your account worth at least  $\$ 50,000$ that can serve as margin on the

In late 2020, GameStop was a little-known, struggling company selling computer games in brick-and-mortar stores. Its stock price was declining, and several hedge funds and institutional traders were shorting its shares. But when the former CEO of Chewy joined the board, its prospects seemed to brighten. The company suddenly became a "mime stock," commanding incredible interest on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets, and emerging as a favorite of traders on the app-based brokerage Robinhood. The enthusiasm of these traders drove the stock price up from about  \$17 at the beginning of January 2021 to an intraday high price of\$ 438 on January 28.

As the stock price rose throughout the month, the hedge funds viewed the firm as even more overpriced, and they increased their short positions. By the third week of January, more than  $100\%$  of the public float in GameStop had been sold short. But as the price continued to rise, the losses on the short positions soared, until finally, the hedge funds decided to close out their shorts. By now, however, it was too late, for a short squeeze had occurred in which there were not enough shares available to satisfy all the shorts that wanted to liquidate their positions. Failure to deliver triggers daily penalties that continue until the shares needed to close out the short position are returned. Moreover, the r/WallStreetBets users were encouraging each other to hold on to their shares (which would exacerbate the short squeeze) to further punish the institutional traders. The losses to short sellers were dramatic, reportedly around 6 billion.


The frenzy ended as dramatically as it began. When the clearinghouse that handles stock trades required Robinhood to come up with additional collateral, the brokerage halted trading of several companies, including GameStop. By the time trading on Robinhood reopened, the stock had declined precipitously, closing below 100 a share on February 2, just about where it stands more than a year later in May 2022.

short sale. Let's say that you have 50,000 in Treasury bills. Your account with the broker after the short sale will then be

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities and Owners&#x27; Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>\$100,000</td><td>Short position in Dot Bomb stock (1,000 shares owed)</td><td>\$100,000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>T-bills</td><td>50,000</td><td>Equity</td><td>50,000</td><td></td></tr></table>

Your initial percentage margin is the ratio of the equity in the account,  \ {50},{000}  ,to the current value of the shares you have borrowed and eventually must return,  \$ {100},{000}  :

$$
\text {P e r c e n t a g e} = \frac {\text {E q u i t y}}{\text {V a l u e o f s t o c k o w e d}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 5 0 , 0 0 0}{\mathbb {S} 1 0 0 , 0 0 0} = . 5 0
$$

Suppose you are right and Dot Bomb falls to \$70 per share. You can now close out your position at a profit. To cover the short sale, you buy 1,000 shares to replace the ones you borrowed. Because the shares now sell for \$70, the purchase costs only \$70,000. Because your account was credited for \$100,000 when the shares were borrowed and sold, your profit is 30,000: The profit equals the decline in the share price times the number of shares sold short.

Like investors who purchase stock on margin, a short-seller must be concerned about margin calls. If the stock price rises, the margin in the account will fall; if margin falls to the maintenance level, the short-seller will receive a margin call.

This Excel spreadsheet model was built using Example 3.3 for Dot Bomb. The model allows you to analyze the effects of returns, margin calls, and different levels of initial and maintenance margins. The model also includes a sensitivity analysis for the ending stock price and return on investment.

# Example 3.4 Margin Calls on Short Positions

Suppose the broker has a maintenance margin of  $30\%$  on short sales. This means the equity in your account must be at least  $30\%$  of the value of your short position at all times. How much can the price of Dot Bomb stock rise before you get a margin call?

Let  P  be the price of Dot Bomb stock. Then the value of the shares you must pay back is  1,000P  and the equity in your account is  \ {150},{000} - 1,{000P}  . Your short position margin ratio is Equity/Value of stock  = \left( {{150},{000} - 1,{000P}}\right) /1,{000P}  . The critical value of  P  is thus

$$
\frac {\text {E q u i t y}}{\text {V a l u e o f s h a r e s o w e d}} = \frac {1 5 0 , 0 0 0 - 1 , 0 0 0 P}{1 , 0 0 0 P} = . 3
$$ which implies that  P = \115.38  per share. If Dot Bomb stock should rise above  \$115.38  per share, you will get a margin call, and you will either have to put up additional cash or cover your short position by buying shares to replace the ones borrowed.


# Short-Selling Comes Under Fire—Again

Short-selling has long been viewed with suspicion, if not outright hostility. England banned short sales for a good part of the 18th century. Napoleon called short-sellers enemies of the state. In the U.S., short-selling was widely viewed as contributing to the market crash of 1929, and in 2008, short-sellers were blamed for the collapse of the investment banks Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.

The rationale for this hostility is that short sales put downward pressure on share prices that in some cases may be unwarranted: Stories abound of investors who first put on a short sale and then spread negative rumors about the firm to drive down its price. More often, however, shorting is a legitimate bet that a share price is too high and is due to fall.

Hostility to short-selling may stem from confusion between bad news and the bearer of that news. Short-selling allows investors whose analysis indicates a firm is overpriced to take action on that belief—and to profit if they are correct. Rather than causing the stock price to fall, shorts may be anticipating a decline in the stock price. Their sales simply force the market to reflect the deteriorating prospects of troubled firms sooner than it might have otherwise. In other words, short-selling is part of the process by which the full range of information and opinion—pessimistic as well as optimistic—is brought to bear on stock prices.


For example, short-sellers took large (negative) positions in firms such as WorldCom, Enron, and Tyco even before these firms were exposed by regulators. In fact, one might argue that these emerging short positions helped regulators identify the previously undetected scandals. And in the end, Lehman and Bear Stearns were brought down by their very real losses on their mortgage-related investments—not by unfounded rumors.

Academic research supports the conjecture that short sales contribute to efficient "price discovery." For example, the greater the demand for shorting a stock, the lower its future returns tend to be; moreover, firms that attack short-sellers with threats of legal action or bad publicity tend to have especially poor future returns.* Short-sale bans may, in the end, be nothing more than an understandable, but nevertheless misguided, impulse to "shoot the messenger."

*See, for example, C. Jones and O. A. Lamont, "Short Sale Constraints and Stock Returns," Journal of Financial Economics, November 2002, pp. 207-39; or O. A. Lamont, "Go Down Fighting: Short Sellers vs. Firms," Review of Asset Pricing Studies, 2012, pp. 1-30.

Short-selling periodically comes under attack, particularly during times of financial stress when share prices fall. The last few years have been no exception to this rule. The above box examines the controversy surrounding short sales in greater detail.

# 3.10 Regulation of Securities Markets

Trading in securities markets in the United States is regulated by a myriad of laws. The major governing legislation includes the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The 1933 act requires full disclosure of relevant information relating to the issue of securities. This is the act that requires registration of new securities and issuance of a prospectus that details the financial prospects of the firm. SEC approval of a prospectus or financial report is not an endorsement of the security as a good investment. The SEC cares only that the relevant facts are disclosed; investors must make their own evaluation of the security's value.

The 1934 act established the Securities and Exchange Commission to administer the provisions of the 1933 act. It also extended the disclosure principle of the 1933 act by requiring periodic disclosure of relevant financial information by firms with already-issued securities on secondary exchanges.


The 1934 act also empowers the SEC to register and regulate securities exchanges, OTC trading, brokers, and dealers. While the SEC is the administrative agency responsible for broad oversight of the securities markets, it shares responsibility with other regulatory agencies. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates trading in futures markets, while the Federal Reserve has broad responsibility for the health of the U.S. financial system. In this role, the Fed sets margin requirements on stocks and stock options and regulates bank lending to security market participants.

The Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 established the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) to protect investors from losses if their brokerage firms fail. Just as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provides depositors with federal protection against bank failure, the SIPC ensures that investors will receive securities held for their account in street name by a failed brokerage firm up to a limit of 500,000 per customer. The SIPC is financed by levying an "insurance premium" on its participating, or member, brokerage firms.

Security trading also is subject to state laws, known generally as blue sky laws because they are intended to give investors a clearer view of investment prospects. Varying state laws were somewhat unified when many states adopted portions of the Uniform Securities Act, which was enacted in 1956.

The 2008 financial crisis also led to regulatory changes, some of which we detailed in Chapter 1. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to monitor the stability of the U.S. financial system. It is largely concerned with risks arising from potential failures of large, interconnected banks, but its voting members are the chairpersons of the main U.S. regulatory agencies, and therefore the FSOC serves a broader role to connect and coordinate key financial regulators.

# Self-Regulation

In addition to government regulation, the securities market exercises considerable self-regulation. The most important overseer in this regard is the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which is the largest nongovernmental regulator of all securities firms in the United States. FINRA was formed in 2007 through the consolidation of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) with the self-regulatory arm of the New York Stock Exchange. It describes its broad mission as the fostering of investor protection and market integrity. It examines securities firms, writes and enforces rules concerning trading practices, and administers a dispute-resolution forum for investors and registered firms.

The community of investment professionals provides another layer of self-regulation. For example, the CFA Institute has developed standards of professional conduct that govern the behavior of members with the Chartered Financial Analysts designation, commonly referred to as CFAs. The nearby box presents a brief outline of those principles.

# The Sarbanes-Oxley Act

public, and, probably most important, misleading financial statements and accounting practices. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, often called SOX, was passed by Congress in 2002 in response to these problems. Among its key provisions are

- It created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to oversee the auditing of public companies.
- It established rules requiring independent financial experts to serve on audit committees of a firm's board of directors.
- CEOs and CFOs must now personally certify that their firms' financial reports "fairly represent, in all material respects, the operations and financial condition of the company," and are subject to personal penalties if those reports turn out to be misleading. Following the letter of the rules may still be necessary, but it is no longer sufficient accounting practice.
Auditors may no longer provide several other services to their clients. This is intended to prevent potential profits on consulting work from influencing the quality of their audit.
- The Board of Directors must be composed of independent directors and hold regular meetings of directors in which company management is not present (and therefore cannot impede or influence the discussion).

More recently, there has been a fair amount of pushback on Sarbanes-Oxley. Many observers believe that the compliance costs associated with the law are too onerous, especially for smaller firms, and that heavy-handed regulatory oversight has given foreign locales an undue advantage over the United States when firms decide where to list their securities. As we saw earlier, the 2012 JOBS Act relieved many smaller firms of some of their obligations under SOX. Moreover, the efficacy of single-country regulation is being tested in the face of increasing globalization and the ease with which funds can move across national borders.

# Insider Trading

Regulations also prohibit insider trading. It is illegal for anyone to transact in securities and thus profit from inside information, that is, private information held by officers, directors, or major stockholders that has not yet been divulged to the public. But the definition of insiders can be ambiguous. While it is obvious that the chief financial officer of a firm is an insider, it is less clear whether the firm's biggest supplier can be considered an insider. Yet a supplier may deduce the firm's near-term prospects from significant changes in orders. This gives the supplier a unique form of private information, yet the supplier is not technically an insider. These ambiguities plague security analysts, whose job is to uncover as much information as possible concerning the firm's expected prospects. The dividing line between legal private information and illegal inside information can be fuzzy.

The SEC requires officers, directors, and major stockholders to report all transactions in their firm's stock. The SEC then puts out a compendium of insider trades. The idea is to inform the public of any implicit vote of confidence or no confidence made by insiders.

Insiders do exploit their knowledge. Three forms of evidence support this conclusion. First, there have been well-publicized convictions of principals in insider trading schemes.

Second, there is considerable evidence of "leakage" of useful information to some traders before any public announcement of that information. For example, share prices of firms announcing dividend increases (which the market interprets as good news concerning the firm's prospects) commonly increase in value a few days before the public announcement of the increase. Clearly, some investors are acting on the good news before it is released to the public. However, share prices still rise substantially on the day of the public release of good news, indicating that insiders, or their associates, have not fully bid up the price of the stock to the level commensurate with the news.

A third form of evidence on insider trading has to do with returns earned on trades by insiders. Researchers have examined the SEC's summary of insider trading to measure the performance of insiders. In one of the best known of these studies, Jaffee examined the abnormal return of stocks over the months following purchases or sales by insiders. For months in which insider purchasers of a stock exceeded insider sellers of the stock by three or more, the stock had an abnormal return in the following eight months of about  $5\%$ . Moreover, when insider sellers exceeded insider buyers, the stock tended to perform poorly.

6Jeffrey E. Jaffee, "Special Information and Insider Trading," Journal of Business 47 (July 1974).

1. Firms issue securities to raise the capital necessary to finance their investments. Investment bankers market these securities to the public on the primary market. Investment bankers generally act as underwriters who purchase the securities from the firm and resell them to the public at a markup. Before the securities may be sold to the public, the firm must publish an SEC-approved prospectus that provides information on the firm's prospects.
2. Already-issued securities are traded on the secondary market, that is, on organized stock markets; on the over-the-counter market; and occasionally, for very large trades, through direct negotiation. Brokerage firms with access to exchanges sell their services to individuals, charging commissions for executing trades on their behalf.
3. Trading may take place in dealer markets, via electronic communication networks, or in specialist/ designated market maker markets. In dealer markets, security dealers post bid and ask prices at which they are willing to trade. Brokers execute trades for their clients at the best available prices. In electronic markets, the existing book of limit orders provides the terms at which trades can be executed. Mutually agreeable offers to buy or sell securities are automatically crossed by the computer system operating the market.
4. NASDAQ was traditionally a dealer market in which a network of dealers negotiated directly over sales of securities. The NYSE was traditionally a specialist market. Today, however, trading in both markets is overwhelmingly electronic.
5. Buying on margin means borrowing money from a broker to buy more securities than can be purchased with one's own money alone. By buying securities on margin, an investor magnifies both the upside potential and the downside risk. If the equity in a margin account falls below the required maintenance level, the investor will get a margin call from the broker.
6. Short-selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own. The short-seller borrows the securities from a broker, sells them, and may be required to cover the short position at any time on demand. The cash proceeds of a short sale are kept in escrow by the broker, and the broker usually requires that the short-seller deposit additional cash or securities to serve as margin (collateral).
7. Securities trading is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, by other government agencies, and through self-regulation of the exchanges. Many of the important regulations have to do with full disclosure of relevant information concerning the securities in question. Insider trading rules also prohibit traders from attempting to profit from inside information.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. Limited-time shelf registration was introduced because its cost savings outweighed the disadvantage of slightly less up-to-date disclosures. Allowing unlimited shelf registration would circumvent "blue sky" laws that ensure proper disclosure as the financial circumstances of the firm change over time.
2. a. Used cars trade in dealer markets (used-car lots or auto dealerships) and in direct search markets when individuals advertise on the Web, for example, on Craigslist.
$b$ . Paintings trade in broker markets when clients commission brokers to buy or sell art for them, in dealer markets at art galleries, and in auction markets.
c. Rare coins trade in dealer markets in coin shops, but they also trade in auctions and in direct search markets when individuals advertise they want to buy or sell coins.
3. a. You should give your broker a market order. It will be executed immediately and is the cheapest type of order in terms of brokerage fees.
b. You should give your broker a limit-buy order, which will be executed only if the shares can be obtained at a price about  $5\%$  below the current price.
c. You should give your broker a limit-sell order, which will be executed if the share price rises above the level at which you are convinced that the firm is overvalued.

$$
\frac {\mathbb {S} 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 - 1 , 0 0 0 P}{1 , 0 0 0 P} = . 4
