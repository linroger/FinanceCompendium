# Chapter 04 - Mutual Funds and Other Investment Companies

THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER introduced you to the mechanics of trading securities and the structure of the markets in which they trade. Commonly, however, individual investors do not trade securities directly for their own accounts. Instead, they direct their funds to investment companies that purchase securities on their behalf. The most important of these financial intermediaries are mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, to which we devote most of this chapter. We also touch briefly on other types of investment companies.

We begin the chapter by describing and comparing the various types of investment companies available to investors—unit investment trusts, closed-end funds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds. We devote most of our attention to mutual and exchange-traded funds, examining their functions, their investment styles and policies, and the costs of investing in them.


Next we take a first look at the investment performance of these funds. We consider the impact of expenses and turnover on net performance. Finally, we discuss sources of information on mutual funds, and we consider in detail the information provided in Morningstar's mutual fund reports.

# 4.1 Investment Companies

Investment companies are financial intermediaries that collect funds from individual investors and invest those funds in a potentially wide range of securities or other assets. Pooling of assets is the key idea behind investment companies. Each investor has a claim to the portfolio established by the investment company in proportion to the amount invested. These companies thus provide a mechanism for small investors to "team up" to obtain the benefits of large-scale investing.

Investment companies perform several important functions for their investors:

1. Record keeping and administration. Investment companies issue periodic status reports, keeping track of capital gains distributions, dividends, investments, and redemptions, and they may reinvest dividend and interest income for shareholders.
2. Diversification and divisibility. By pooling their money, investment companies enable investors to hold fractional shares of many different securities. The companies can act as large investors even if any individual shareholder cannot.
3. Professional management. Investment companies can support full-time staffs of security analysts and portfolio managers who attempt to achieve superior investment results for their investors.
4. Lower transaction costs. Because they trade large blocks of securities, investment companies can achieve substantial savings on trading costs.

While investment companies pool assets of individual investors, they also need to divide claims to those assets among those investors. Investors buy shares in investment companies, and ownership is proportional to the number of shares purchased. The value of each share is called the net asset value (NAV). Net asset value equals assets minus liabilities expressed on a per-share basis:

$$
\text{Net asset value} = \frac{\text{Market value of assets - Liabilities}}{\text{Shares outstanding}}
$$

**Example 4.1 Net Asset Value**

Consider a mutual fund that manages a portfolio of securities worth  \$120 million. Suppose the fund owes\$ 4 million to its investment advisers and another 1 million for rent, wages due, and miscellaneous expenses. The fund has 5 million shares outstanding.

$$
\text{Net asset value} = \frac {\$120 \text{million} - \$5 \text{million}}{5 \text{million shares}} = \$23 \text{per share}
$$

Assets: 4,034.4

Liabilities: 81.8

Shares: 101.1

## 4.2 Types of Investment Companies

In the United States, investment companies are classified by the Investment Company Act of 1940 as either unit investment trusts or managed investment companies. The portfolios of unit investment trusts are essentially fixed and thus are called "unmanaged." In contrast, managed companies are so named because securities in their investment portfolios are continually bought and sold: The portfolios are managed. Managed companies are further classified as either closed-end or open-end. Open-end companies are what we commonly call mutual funds.


### Unit Investment Trusts

Unit investment trusts are pools of money invested in a portfolio that is fixed for the life of the fund. To form a unit investment trust, a sponsor, typically a brokerage firm, buys a portfolio of securities that are deposited into a trust. It then sells shares, or "units," in the trust, called redeemable trust certificates. All income and payments of principal from the portfolio are paid out by the fund's trustees (a bank or trust company) to the shareholders.

There is little active management of a unit investment trust because once established, the portfolio composition is fixed; hence, these trusts are referred to as unmanaged. Trusts tend to invest in relatively uniform types of assets; for example, one trust may invest in municipal bonds, another in corporate bonds. The uniformity of the portfolio is consistent with the lack of active management. The trusts provide investors a vehicle to purchase a pool of one particular type of asset that can be included in an overall portfolio as desired.

Sponsors of unit investment trusts earn their profit by selling shares in the trust at a premium to the cost of acquiring the underlying assets. For example, a trust that has purchased  \$5 million of assets may sell 5,000 shares to the public at a price of\$ 1,030 per share, which (assuming the trust has no liabilities) represents a $3\%$ premium over the net asset value of the securities held by the trust. The $3\%$ premium is the trustee's fee for establishing the trust.

Investors who wish to liquidate their holdings of a unit investment trust may sell the shares back to the trustee for net asset value. The trustees can either sell enough securities from the asset portfolio to obtain the cash necessary to pay the investor, or they may instead sell the shares to a new investor (again at a slight premium to net asset value). Unit investment trusts have steadily lost market share to mutual funds in recent years. While mutual fund assets have soared, assets in such trusts declined from  \$105 billion in 1990 to only \$78 billion in 2021.

### Managed Investment Companies

There are two types of managed companies: closed-end and open-end. In both cases, the fund's board of directors, which is elected by shareholders, hires a management company to manage the portfolio for an annual fee that typically ranges from  $0.2\%$ to $1.25\%$  of assets. In many cases the management company is the firm that organized the fund. For example, Fidelity Management and Research Corporation sponsors many Fidelity mutual funds and is responsible for managing the portfolios. It assesses a management fee on each Fidelity fund. In other cases, a mutual fund will hire an outside portfolio manager. For example, Vanguard has hired Wellington Management as the investment adviser for its Wellington Fund. Most management companies have contracts to manage several funds.

Open-end funds stand ready to redeem or issue shares at their net asset value (although both purchases and redemptions may involve sales charges). When investors in open-end funds wish to "cash out" their shares, they sell them back to the fund at NAV. In contrast, closed-end funds do not redeem or issue shares. Investors who wish to cash out must sell their shares to other investors. Shares of closed-end funds are traded on organized exchanges and can be purchased through brokers just like other

In 2021, about 280 billion of assets were held in closed-end funds.

Figure 4.1 Closed-end mutual funds

Figure 4.1 lists a few closed-end funds. The first column gives the name and ticker symbol of the fund. The next two columns give the fund's most recent price and net asset value. The premium or discount in the next column is the percentage difference between price and NAV: (Price - NAV)/NAV. Discounts to NAV (indicated by negative differences) are more common than premiums. Finally, the 52-week return based on the change in NAV plus dividends is presented in the last column.

The common divergence of price from net asset value, often by wide margins, is a puzzle that has yet to be fully explained. To see why this is a puzzle, consider a closed-end fund selling for less than net asset value. By selling all the assets in the portfolio, the fund would realize proceeds equal to net asset value, thus immediately increasing the wealth of its investors. Despite this apparent profit opportunity, sizable discounts seem to persist for long periods of time.


Moreover, fund premiums or discounts tend to dissipate over time, so funds selling at a discount receive a boost to their rate of return as the discount shrinks. Pontiff estimates that a fund selling at a $20\%$ discount would have an expected 12-month return more than $6\%$ greater than funds selling at net asset value.

Interestingly, while many closed-end funds sell at a discount from net asset value, the prices of these funds when originally issued are often above NAV. This is a further puzzle, as it is hard to explain why investors would purchase these newly issued funds at a premium to NAV when the shares tend to fall to a discount shortly after issue.

In contrast to closed-end funds, the price of open-end funds will never fall below NAV because these funds stand ready to redeem shares at NAV. The offering price will exceed NAV, however, if the fund carries a load, which is, in effect, a sales charge. Load funds are sold by securities brokers and directly by mutual fund groups.

Unlike closed-end funds, open-end mutual funds do not trade on organized exchanges. Instead, investors simply buy shares from and liquidate through the investment company at net asset value. Thus, the number of outstanding shares of these funds changes daily. In 2021, about 280 billion of assets were held in closed-end funds.

### Exchange-Traded Funds

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are similar in several respects to open-end mutual funds. Like mutual funds, most ETFs are classified and regulated as investment companies. Also like mutual funds, they offer investors a prorated ownership share of a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets and report net asset value each day.

However, in contrast to mutual funds, where investors buy and redeem shares directly with the sponsoring company, investors buy and sell ETF shares through a broker just as they would shares of stock. These transactions occur continuously throughout the day, rather than (as is the case for mutual funds) once a day at the NAV computed at market close.

ETFs were first issued in the United States in 1993 and until about 2008, offered exclusively portfolios designed to track various market indexes. While indexed ETFs still dominate the market, they have since been joined by hundreds of actively managed funds. The ETF market has experienced tremendous growth: By early 2022, ETFs with over 5.4 trillion in assets under management traded in the United States. We discuss these securities in more detail later in the chapter.

### Other Investment Organizations

Some intermediaries are not formally organized or regulated as investment companies but nevertheless serve similar functions. Three of the more important are commingled funds, real estate investment trusts, and hedge funds.

Commingled Funds Commingled funds are partnerships of investors that pool funds. The management firm that organizes the partnership, for example, a bank or insurance company, manages the funds for a fee. Typical partners in a commingled fund might be trust or retirement accounts with portfolios much larger than those of most individual investors, but still too small to warrant managing on a separate basis.

Commingled funds are similar in form to open-end mutual funds. Instead of shares, though, the fund offers units, which are bought and sold at net asset value. A bank or insurance company may offer an array of different commingled funds, for example, a money market fund, a bond fund, and a common stock fund.

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) A REIT is similar to a closed-end fund. REITs invest in real estate or loans secured by real estate. Besides issuing shares, they raise capital by borrowing from banks and issuing bonds or mortgages. Most of them are highly leveraged, with a typical debt ratio of $70\%$ .

There are two principal kinds of REITs. Equity trusts invest in real estate directly, whereas mortgage trusts invest primarily in mortgage and construction loans. REITs generally are established by banks, insurance companies, or mortgage companies, which then serve as investment managers to earn a fee.

Hedge Funds Like mutual funds, hedge funds are vehicles that allow private investors to pool assets to be invested by a fund manager. Unlike mutual funds, however, hedge funds are commonly structured as private partnerships and thus subject to only minimal SEC regulation. They typically are open only to wealthy or institutional investors. Many require investors to agree to initial "lock-ups," that is, periods as long as several years in which investments cannot be withdrawn. Lock-ups allow hedge funds to invest in illiquid assets without worrying about meeting demands for redemption of funds. Moreover, because hedge funds are only lightly regulated, their managers can pursue investment strategies involving, for example, heavy use of derivatives, short sales, and leverage; such strategies typically are not open to mutual fund managers.

Hedge funds by design are empowered to invest in a wide range of investments, with various funds focusing on derivatives, distressed firms, currency speculation, convertible bonds, emerging markets, merger arbitrage, and so on. Other funds may jump from one asset class to another as perceived investment opportunities shift.

Hedge funds enjoyed great growth in the last few decades, with assets under management ballooning from about  \$50 billion in 1990 to about \$4 trillion in 2021. We devote a good part of Chapter 26 to these funds.

## 4.3 Mutual Funds

Mutual funds are the common name for open-end investment companies. This is the dominant investment company today, accounting for about $80\%$ of investment company assets. Assets under management in the U.S. mutual fund industry were approximately  $\$23.9$ trillion in early 2021, with nearly another  $\$40$ trillion managed by non-U.S. mutual and exchange-traded funds.

### Investment Policies

Each mutual fund has a specified investment policy, which is described in the fund's prospectus. For example, money market mutual funds hold the short-term, low-risk instruments of the money market (see Chapter 2 for a review of these securities), while bond funds hold fixed-income securities. Some funds have even more narrowly defined mandates. For example, some bond funds will hold primarily Treasury bonds, others primarily mortgage-backed securities.

Management companies manage a family, or "complex," of mutual funds. They organize an entire collection of funds and collect a management fee for operating them. By managing a collection of funds under one umbrella, these companies make it easy for investors to allocate assets across market sectors and to switch assets across funds while still benefiting from centralized record keeping. Some of the most well-known management companies are Fidelity, Vanguard, and BlackRock. Each offers an array of open-end mutual funds with different investment policies. In 2021, there were nearly 8,000 mutual funds in the U.S., which were offered by more than 800 fund complexes.

Funds are commonly classified by investment policy into one of the following groups: money market funds, equity funds, sector funds, bond funds, international funds, balanced funds, asset allocation and flexible funds, and index funds.

Money Market Funds These funds invest in money market securities such as Treasury bills, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, or certificates of deposit. The average maturity of these assets tends to be a bit more than 1 month. Money market funds usually offer check-writing features and net asset value is fixed at 1 per share,[2] so there are no tax implications such as capital gains or losses associated with redemption of shares.

Money market funds are classified as prime versus government. As their name suggests, government funds hold short-term U.S. Treasury or agency securities and repurchase agreements collateralized by such securities. Prime funds also hold other money market instruments such as commercial paper or bank CDs. While these assets are certainly at the very safe end of the credit-risk spectrum, they are nevertheless riskier than government securities and are more prone to suffer reduced liquidity in times of market stress. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, prime funds are now subject to "gates" that allow funds to temporarily halt redemptions during periods of severe disruption.

Moreover, while both prime and government retail money market funds maintain net asset value at 1.00 per share, prime institutional funds now must calculate and report net asset value. While capital gains or losses will normally be very small, this "floating" of NAV has contributed to a shift in investor demand from prime to government funds.

Equity Funds Equity funds invest primarily in stock, although they may, at the portfolio manager's discretion, also hold fixed-income or other types of securities. Equity funds commonly hold a small fraction of total assets in money market securities to provide the liquidity necessary to meet potential redemption of shares.

Stock funds are traditionally classified by their emphasis on capital appreciation versus current income. Thus, income funds tend to hold shares of firms with consistently high dividend yields. Growth funds are willing to forgo current income, focusing instead on prospects for capital gains. While the classification of these funds is couched in terms of income versus capital gains, in practice, the more relevant distinction concerns the level of risk these funds assume. Growth stocks, and therefore growth funds, are typically riskier and respond more dramatically to changes in economic conditions than do income funds.

Sector Funds Some equity funds, called sector funds, concentrate on a particular industry. For example, Fidelity markets dozens of "select funds," each of which invests in a specific industry such as biotechnology, utilities, energy, or telecommunications. Other funds specialize in securities of particular countries.

Bond Funds As the name suggests, these funds specialize in the fixed-income sector. Within that sector, however, there is considerable room for further specialization. For example, various funds will concentrate on corporate bonds, Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities, or municipal (tax-free) bonds. Indeed, some municipal bond funds invest only in bonds of a particular state to satisfy the investment desires of residents of that state who wish to avoid local as well as federal taxes on interest income. Many funds also specialize by maturity, ranging from short-term to intermediate to long-term, or by the credit risk of the issuer, ranging from very safe to high-yield, or "junk," bonds.

International Funds Many funds have an international focus. Global funds invest in securities worldwide, including the United States. In contrast, international funds invest in securities of firms located outside the United States. Regional funds concentrate on a particular part of the world, and emerging market funds invest in companies of developing nations.

Balanced Funds Some funds are designed to be candidates for an individual's entire investment portfolio. These balanced funds hold both equities and fixed-income securities in relatively stable proportions. Life-cycle funds are balanced funds in which the asset mix can range from aggressive (primarily marketed to younger investors) to conservative (directed at older investors). Static allocation life-cycle funds maintain a stable mix across stocks and bonds, while target-date funds gradually become more conservative as time passes and the date of a particular milestone such as retirement draws nearer.

Many balanced funds are in fact funds of funds. These are mutual funds that primarily invest in shares of other mutual funds. Balanced funds of funds invest in equity and bond funds in proportions suited to their investment goals.

Asset Allocation and Flexible Funds These funds are similar to balanced funds in that they hold both stocks and bonds. However, asset allocation funds may dramatically vary the proportions allocated to each market in accord with the portfolio manager's forecast of the relative performance of each sector. Hence, these funds are engaged in market timing and are not designed to be low-risk investment vehicles.

Index Funds An index fund tries to match the performance of a broad market index. The fund buys shares in securities included in a particular index in proportion to each security's representation in that index. For example, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund is a mutual fund that replicates the composition of the Standard & Poor's 500 stock price index. Because the S&P 500 is a value-weighted index, the fund buys shares in each S&P 500 company in proportion to the market value of that company's outstanding equity. Investment in an index fund is a low-cost way for small investors to pursue a passive investment strategy—that is, to invest without engaging in security analysis. About $40\%$ of the assets in mutual and exchange-traded funds in 2021 were indexed. While the majority of these were in equity funds, index funds can be tied to nonequity indexes as well. For example, Vanguard offers a bond index fund and a real estate index fund.


Table 4.1 breaks down the number of mutual funds by investment orientation. Sometimes a fund name describes its investment policy. For example, Vanguard's GNMA fund invests in mortgage-backed securities, the Municipal Intermediate fund invests in intermediate-term municipal bonds, and the High-Yield Corporate bond fund invests in large part in speculative grade, or "junk," bonds with high yields. However, names of common stock funds often reflect little or nothing about their investment policies. Examples are Vanguard's Windsor and Wellington funds.

### How Funds Are Sold

Mutual funds are generally marketed to the public either directly by the fund underwriter or indirectly through brokers acting on behalf of the underwriter. Direct-marketed funds are sold through the mail, various offices of the fund, over the phone, or, more so, over the Internet. Investors contact the fund directly to purchase shares.

About half of fund sales today are distributed through a sales force. Brokers or financial advisers receive a commission for selling shares to investors. (Ultimately, the commission is paid by the investor. More on this shortly.) Investors who rely on their broker's advice to select their mutual funds should be aware that this advice may suffer from a conflict of interest if the broker receives compensation for directing the sale to a particular fund.

Many funds also are sold through "financial supermarkets" that sell shares in funds of many complexes. Instead of charging customers a sales commission, the broker splits management fees with the mutual fund company. Another advantage is unified record keeping for all funds purchased from the supermarket, even if the funds are offered by different complexes. On the other hand, many contend that these supermarkets result in higher expense ratios because mutual funds pass along the costs of participating in these programs in the form of higher management fees.

## 4.4 Costs of Investing in Mutual Funds

### Fee Structure

An individual investor choosing a mutual fund should consider not only the fund's stated investment policy and past performance but also its management fees and other expenses. Comparative data on virtually all important aspects of mutual funds are available on Morningstar's Web site at www.morningstar.com. You should be aware of four general classes of fees.

Operating Expenses Operating expenses are the costs incurred by the mutual fund in operating the portfolio, including administrative expenses and advisory fees paid to the investment manager. These expenses, usually expressed as a percentage of total assets under management, may range from $0.2\%$ to $1.5\%$ annually. Shareholders do not receive an explicit bill for these operating expenses; instead, the expenses periodically are deducted from the assets of the fund. Shareholders pay for these expenses through the reduced value of the portfolio.

The simple average of the expense ratio of all equity funds in the U.S. was  $1.16\%$  in 2020. But larger funds tend to have lower expense ratios, so the average expense ratio weighted by assets under management is considerably smaller, .50\%. (These expense ratios all include 12b-1 fees, if any, which are discussed shortly.) Not surprisingly, the average expense ratio of actively managed funds is considerably higher than that of indexed funds, .71\% versus .06\% (weighted by assets under management).

In addition to operating expenses, many funds assess fees to pay for marketing and distribution costs. These charges are used primarily to pay the brokers or financial advisers who sell the funds to the public. One can avoid these expenses by buying shares directly from the fund sponsor, but many investors are willing to incur these distribution fees in return for the advice they may receive from their broker.

Front-End Load A front-end load is a commission or sales charge paid when you purchase the shares. These charges, which are used primarily to pay the brokers who sell the funds, may not exceed 8.5\%, but in practice they are rarely higher than 6\%. Low-load funds have loads that range up to 3\% of invested funds. No-load funds have no front-end sales charges. Loads effectively reduce the amount of money invested. For example, each \$1,000 paid for a fund with a 6\% load incurs a sales charge of \$60 and fund investment of only \$940. You need cumulative returns of 6.4\% of your net investment (60/940 = .064) just to break even.

Back-End Load A back-end load is a redemption, or "exit," fee incurred when you sell your shares. Typically, funds that impose back-end loads reduce them by 1 percentage point for every year the funds are left invested. Thus, an exit fee that starts at $4\%$ would fall to $2\%$  by the start of your third year. These charges are known more formally as "contingent deferred sales loads."

12b-1 Charges The Securities and Exchange Commission allows the managers of so-called 12b-1 funds to use fund assets to pay for distribution costs such as advertising, promotional literature including annual reports and prospectuses, and, most important, commissions paid to brokers who sell the fund to investors. These 12b-1 fees are named after the SEC rule that permits use of these plans. Funds may use 12b-1 charges instead of, or in addition to, front-end loads to generate the fees with which to pay brokers. As with operating expenses, investors are not explicitly billed for 12b-1 charges. Instead, the fees are deducted from the assets of the fund. Therefore, 12b-1 fees (if any) must be added to operating expenses to obtain the true annual expense ratio of the fund. The SEC requires that all funds include in the prospectus a consolidated expense table that summarizes all relevant fees. The 12b-1 fees are limited to $1\%$ of a fund's average net assets per year. $^3$

Many funds offer "classes" that represent ownership in the same portfolio of securities, but with different combinations of fees. Typically, Class A shares have front-end loads and a small 12b-1 fee, often around $0.25\%$ . Class C shares rely more on 12b-1 fees, commonly $1\%$ , and often charge a modest back-end load. Class I shares are sold to institutional investors. These are sometimes called class Y shares and carry no loads or 12b-1 fees.

**Example 4.2 Fees for Various Classes**

The table below lists fees for different classes of the BNY Mellon (formerly Dreyfus) High Yield Fund in 2021. Notice the trade-off between the front-end loads versus 12b-1 charges in the choice between Class A and Class C shares. Class I shares are sold only to institutional investors and carry lower fees.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Class A</td><td>Class C</td><td>Class I</td></tr><tr><td>Front-end load</td><td>0-4.5\%a</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Back-end load</td><td>0</td><td>0-1\%b</td><td>0\%</td></tr><tr><td>12b-1 feesc</td><td>0.25\%</td><td>1.0\%</td><td>0\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expense ratio</td><td>0.7\%</td><td>0.7\%</td><td>0.7\%</td></tr></table> aDepending on size of investment. Starts at $4.5\%$ for investments less than \$50,000 and tapers to zero for investments more than \$ 1 million.


bDepending on years until holdings are sold. Exit fee is $1\%$ for shares redeemed within one year of purchase.

cIncluding annual service fee.

The maximum 12b-1 charge for the sale of the fund is .75\%. However, an additional service fee of .25\% of the fund's assets also is allowed for personal service and/or maintenance of shareholder accounts.

4Many funds used to market Class B shares as well. These shares had higher expense ratios, particularly higher back-end loads. However, if an investor held Class B shares for a long enough duration, typically 6-8 years, the shares would convert into Class A shares. Class B shares have become increasingly less common in recent years.

Each investor must choose the best combination of fees. Obviously, pure no-load no-fee funds distributed directly by the mutual fund group are the cheapest alternative, and these will often make most sense for knowledgeable investors. However, as we have noted, many investors are willing to pay for financial advice, and the commissions paid to advisers who sell these funds are the most common form of payment. Alternatively, investors may choose to hire a fee-only financial manager who charges directly for services instead of collecting commissions. These advisers can help investors select portfolios of low- or no-load funds (as well as provide other financial advice). Independent financial planners have become increasingly important distribution channels for funds in recent years.

If you do buy a fund through a broker, the choice between paying a load and paying 12b-1 fees will depend primarily on your expected time horizon. Loads are paid only once for each purchase, whereas 12b-1 fees are paid annually. Thus, if you plan to hold your fund for a long time, a one-time load may be preferable to recurring 12b-1 charges.

### Fees and Mutual Fund Returns

The rate of return on a mutual fund investment is the increase or decrease in net asset value plus income distributions such as dividends or distributions of capital gains, all expressed as a fraction of net asset value at the beginning of the investment period. If we denote the net asset value at the start and end of the period as  $\mathrm{NAV}_0$  and  $\mathrm{NAV}_1$ , respectively, then

\text{Rate} = \frac{\mathrm{NAV}_1 - \mathrm{NAV}_0 + \text{Income and capital gain distributions}}{\mathrm{NAV}_0}
$$

For example, if a fund has an initial NAV of  \$20 at the start of the month, makes income distributions of$ .15 and capital gain distributions of $.05, and ends the month with NAV of \$20.10, the monthly rate of return is

$$
\text{Rate of return} = \frac{\$20.10 - \$20.00 + \$.15 + \$.05}{\$20.00} = .015, \text{or } 1.5\%
$$

Notice that this measure of the rate of return ignores any commissions such as front-end loads paid to purchase the fund.

On the other hand, the rate of return is affected by the fund's expenses and 12b-1 fees. This is because such charges are periodically deducted from the portfolio, which reduces net asset value. Thus, the investor's rate of return equals the gross return on the underlying portfolio minus the total expense ratio.

**Example 4.3 Fees and Net Returns**

To see how expenses can affect rate of return, consider a fund with \$100 million in assets at the start of the year and with 10 million shares outstanding. The fund invests in a portfolio of stocks that provides no income but increases in value by $10\%$ . The expense ratio, including 12b-1 fees, is $1\%$ . What is the rate of return for an investor in the fund?

The initial NAV equals \$100 million/10 million shares = \$10 per share. In the absence of expenses, fund assets would grow to \$110 million and NAV would grow to \$11 per share, for a 10\% rate of return. However, the expense ratio of the fund is 1\%. Therefore, \$1 million will be deducted from the fund to pay these fees, leaving the portfolio worth only \$109 million and NAV equal to 10.90. The rate of return on the fund is only 9\%, which equals the gross return on the underlying portfolio minus the total expense ratio.

3. Fund C has a $6\%$ load on purchases and a $0.8\%$ expense ratio.
4. Gross return on all funds is $10\%$ per year before expenses.

Fees can have a big effect on performance. Table 4.2 considers an investor who starts with 10,000 and can choose among three funds that all earn an annual 10\% return on investment before fees but have different fee structures. The table shows the cumulative amount in each fund after several investment horizons. Fund A has total operating expenses of .25\%, no load, and no 12b-1 charges. This might represent a low-cost producer like Vanguard. Fund B has no load but has .75\% in management expenses and .5\% in 12b-1 fees. This level of charges is fairly typical of actively managed equity funds. Finally, Fund C has .80\% in management expenses, has no 12b-1 charges, but assesses a 6\% front-end load on purchases.

Note the substantial return advantage of low-cost Fund A. Moreover, that differential is greater for longer investment horizons.

**Concept Check 4.2**

The Equity Fund sells Class A shares with a front-end load of $4\%$ and Class C shares with 12b- 1 fees of .5\% annually as well as back- end load fees that start at $5\%$ and fall by $1\%$ for each full year the investor holds the portfolio (until the fifth year). Assume the rate of return on the fund portfolio net of operating expenses is $10\%$ annually. What will be the value of a \$10,000 investment in Class A and Class C shares if the shares are sold after (a) 1 year, (b) 4 years, and (c) 10 years? Which fee structure provides higher net proceeds at the end of each investment horizon?

Although expenses can have a big impact on net investment performance, it is sometimes difficult for the investor in a mutual fund to measure true expenses accurately. This is because of the practice of paying for some expenses in soft dollars. A portfolio manager earns soft-dollar credits with a brokerage firm by directing the fund's trades to that broker. On the basis of those credits, the broker will pay for some of the mutual fund's expenses, such as databases, computer hardware, or stock-Quotation systems. The soft-dollar arrangement means that the stockbroker effectively returns part of the trading commission to the fund. Purchases made with soft dollars are not included in the fund's expenses, so funds with extensive soft-dollar arrangements may report artificially low expense ratios to the public. However, the fund may have paid its broker needlessly high commissions to obtain its soft-dollar "rebate." The impact of the higher trading commission shows up in net investment performance rather than the reported expense ratio.

## 4.5 Taxation of Mutual Fund Income

Investment returns of mutual funds are granted "pass-through status" under the U.S. tax code, meaning that taxes are paid only by the investor in the mutual fund, not by the fund itself. The income is treated as passed through to the investor as long as the fund meets several requirements, most notably that virtually all income is distributed to shareholders. A fund's short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains, and dividends are passed through to investors as though the investor earned the income directly.

The pass-through of investment income has one important disadvantage for individual investors. If you manage your own portfolio, you decide when to realize capital gains and losses on any security; therefore, you can time those realizations to efficiently manage your tax liabilities. When you invest through a mutual fund, however, the timing of security sales is out of your control, which reduces your ability to engage in tax management.[5]

A fund with a high portfolio turnover rate can be particularly "tax inefficient." Turnover is the ratio of the trading activity of a portfolio to the assets of the portfolio. It measures the fraction of the portfolio that is "replaced" each year. For example, a \$100 million portfolio with \$50 million in sales of some securities and purchases of other securities would have a turnover rate of $50\%$. High turnover means that capital gains or losses are being realized continually, and therefore that the investor cannot time the realizations to manage his or her overall tax obligation.

Until recently, turnover rates in equity funds typically were around $50\%$  when weighted by assets under management. By contrast, a low-turnover fund such as an index fund may have turnover as low as $2\%$ , which is both tax-efficient and economical with respect to trading costs. However, in the last decade, asset-weighted average turnover has dropped considerably, falling to $32\%$ in 2020. Part of this decline probably reflects the shift from actively managed to indexed funds.

SEC rules require funds to disclose the tax impact of portfolio turnover. Funds must include in their prospectus after-tax returns for the past 1-, 5-, and 10-year periods. Marketing literature that includes performance data also must include after-tax results. The after-tax returns are computed accounting for the impact of the taxable distributions of income and capital gains passed through to the investor, assuming the investor is in the maximum federal tax bracket.

**Concept Check 4.3**

An investor's portfolio currently is worth \$1 million. During the year, the investor sells 400 shares of Etsy at a price of \$200 per share and 1,600 shares of Cisco at a price of \$50 per share. The proceeds are used to buy 1,000 shares of Apple at \$160 per share.

a. What is the portfolio turnover rate?
b. If the shares in Etsy originally were purchased for  \$175 each and those in Cisco were purchased for\$ 40, and the investor's tax rate on capital gains income is $20\%$, how much extra will the investor owe on this year's taxes as a result of these transactions?

## 4.6 Exchange-Traded Funds

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), first introduced in 1993, are offshoots of mutual funds that allow investors to trade entire portfolios just as they do shares of stock. The first ETF was the "spider," a nickname for SPDR, or Standard & Poor's Depository Receipt, which is a unit investment trust holding a portfolio matching the S&P 500 Index. Unlike mutual funds, which can be bought or sold only at the end of the day when NAV is calculated, investors can trade spiders throughout the day, just like any other share of stock. Spiders gave rise to many similar products such as "diamonds" (based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, ticker DIA), "cubes" (based on the NASDAQ 100 index, ticker QQQ), and "WEBS" (World Equity Benchmark Shares, which are shares in portfolios of foreign stock market indexes). By 2022, about 9.5 trillion was invested in more than 2,200 U.S. ETFs.

Figure 4.2 shows the rapid growth in the ETF market since 1998. The market leaders are Vanguard, State Street, and BlackRock, which uses the product name iShares for its funds. The firms sponsor ETFs for several dozen equity index funds, including many broad U.S. equity indexes, broad international and single-country funds, and U.S. and global industry-sector funds. They also offer several bond ETFs and a few commodity funds such as ones for gold and silver.

Until 2008, ETFs were required to track specified indexes, and ETFs tracking broad indexes still dominate the industry. Starting in 2008, the SEC granted approval for so-called actively managed ETFs with other investment objectives, for example, focusing on attributes such as value, growth, dividend yield, liquidity, recent performance, or volatility. These are often called smart beta funds because "beta" is often used as jargon for the sensitivity to one or another factor. Another term in common use is factor-based funds.

These funds are still transparent in the sense that they must disclose portfolio composition each day. In 2021, there were about 500 of these ETFs, with assets under management exceeding 170 billion.

Today, there are dozens of industry-sector ETFs, and as Figure 4.2 makes clear, a significant number of commodity, bond, and international ETFs. In addition to factor and industry-based funds, many mutual fund companies such as Fidelity now offer ETFs that mimic their popular mutual funds. Figure 4.3 shows that ETFs have captured a significant portion of the assets under management in the investment company universe.

Another recent innovation is nontransparent actively managed ETFs that, like actively managed mutual funds, attempt to outperform passive indexes. If these funds had to report portfolio holdings on a daily basis, competitors could take advantage of their buying and

In 2014, however, the SEC gave permission to Eaton Vance to offer an actively managed "nontransparent" ETF that is required to report its portfolio composition only once each quarter, the same frequency at which mutual funds disclose their portfolio holdings, and that product, called NextShares, began trading in 2016. Other companies such as BlackRock have also indicated interest in sponsoring nontransparent ETFs, but to date, these products constitute only a tiny sliver of the broad ETF market.

Other even more exotic variations are so-called synthetic ETFs such as exchange-traded notes (ETNs) or exchange-traded vehicles (ETVs). These are nominally debt securities, but with payoffs linked to the performance of an index. Often that index measures the performance of an illiquid and thinly traded asset class, so the ETF gives the investor the opportunity to add that asset class to his or her portfolio. However, rather than invest in those assets directly, the ETF achieves this exposure by entering a "total return swap" with an investment bank in which the bank agrees to pay the ETF the return on the index in exchange for a relatively fixed fee. These products are a bit controversial, as the ETF is then exposed to risk that in a period of financial stress the investment bank will be unable to fulfill its obligation, leaving investors without the returns they were promised.

ETFs offer several advantages over conventional mutual funds. First, a mutual fund's net asset value is quoted—and, therefore, investors can buy or sell their shares in the fund—only once a day. In contrast, ETFs trade continuously. Moreover, like other shares, but unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be sold short or purchased on margin.

ETFs also offer a potential tax advantage over mutual funds. When large numbers of mutual fund investors redeem their shares, the fund must sell securities to meet the redemptions. This can trigger capital gains taxes, which are passed through to and must be paid by the remaining shareholders. In contrast, when small investors wish to redeem their position in an ETF, they simply sell their shares to other traders, with no need for the fund to sell any of the underlying portfolio. Large investors can exchange their ETF shares for shares in the underlying portfolio; this form of redemption also avoids a tax event.

ETFs are also cheaper than mutual funds. Investors who buy ETFs do so through brokers rather than buying directly from the fund. Therefore, the fund saves the cost of marketing itself directly to small investors. This reduction in expenses may translate into lower management fees.

There are some disadvantages to ETFs, however. First, while mutual funds can be bought at no expense from no-load funds, the purchase of an ETF entails a broker's commission. In addition, because ETFs trade as securities, their prices can depart from NAV, at least for short periods, and these price discrepancies can easily swamp the cost advantage that ETFs otherwise offer. While those discrepancies typically are quite small, they can spike unpredictably when markets are stressed. Chapter 3 briefly discussed the so-called flash crash of May 6, 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 583 points in seven minutes, leaving it down nearly 1,000 points for the day. Remarkably, the index recovered more than 600 points in the next 10 minutes. In the wake of this incredible volatility, the stock exchanges canceled many trades that had gone off at what were viewed as distorted prices. Around one-fifth of all ETFs changed hands on that day at prices less than one-half of their closing price, and ETFs accounted for about two-thirds of all canceled trades.

At least two problems were exposed in this episode. First, when markets are not working properly, it can be hard to measure the net asset value of the ETF portfolio, especially for ETFs that track less liquid assets. And, reinforcing this problem, some ETFs may be supported by only a very small number of dealers. If they drop out of the market during a period of turmoil, prices may swing wildly.

## 4.7 Mutual Fund Investment Performance: A First Look

We noted earlier that one of the benefits of mutual funds for the individual investor is the ability to delegate management of the portfolio to investment professionals. The investor retains control over the broad features of the overall portfolio through the asset allocation decision: Each individual chooses the percentages of the portfolio to invest in bond funds versus equity funds versus money market funds, and so forth, but can leave the specific security selection decisions within each investment class to fund managers. Shareholders hope that these portfolio managers can achieve better investment performance than they could obtain on their own.

What is the investment record of the mutual fund industry? This seemingly straightforward question is deceptively difficult to answer because we need a standard against which to evaluate performance. For example, we clearly would not want to compare the investment performance of an equity fund to the rate of return available in the money market. The vast differences in the risk of these two markets dictate that year-by-year as well as average performance will differ considerably. We would expect to find that equity funds outperform money market funds (on average) as compensation to investors for the extra risk incurred in equity markets. How then can we determine whether mutual fund portfolio managers are performing up to par given the level of risk they incur? In other words, what is the proper benchmark against which investment performance ought to be evaluated?

Measuring portfolio risk properly and using such measures to choose an appropriate benchmark is far from straightforward. We devote all of Parts Two and Three of the text to issues surrounding the proper measurement of portfolio risk and the trade-off between risk and return. In this chapter, therefore, we will satisfy ourselves with a first look at the question of fund performance by using only very simple performance benchmarks and ignoring the more subtle issues of risk differences across funds. However, we will return to this topic in Chapter 11, where we take a closer look at mutual fund performance after adjusting for differences in the exposure of portfolios to various sources of risk.

Here we use as a benchmark for the performance of equity fund managers the rate of return on the Wilshire 5000 index. Recall from Chapter 2 that this is a value-weighted index of the roughly 3,500 actively traded stocks in the U.S. The performance of the Wilshire 5000 is a useful benchmark with which to evaluate professional managers because it corresponds to a simple passive investment strategy: Buy all the shares in the index in proportion to their outstanding market value. Moreover, this is a feasible strategy for even small investors because the Vanguard Group offers an index fund (its Total Stock Market Portfolio) designed to replicate the performance of the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index, which is almost identical to the Wilshire 5000 index. Using the Wilshire 5000 index as a benchmark, we may pose the problem of evaluating the performance of mutual fund portfolio managers this way: How does the typical performance of actively managed equity mutual funds compare to the performance of a passively managed portfolio that simply replicates the composition of a broad index of the stock market?

Casual comparisons of the performance of the Wilshire 5000 index versus that of professionally managed mutual funds reveal disappointing results for active managers. Figure 4.4 shows that the asset-weighted average return on domestic U.S. equity funds was below the return on the Wilshire index in 30 of the 50 years from 1971 to 2020. The average annual return on the index was $12.49\%$, which was $96\%$ greater than that of the average mutual fund.[7]

This result may seem surprising. After all, it would not seem unreasonable to expect that professional money managers should be able to outperform a very simple rule such as "hold an indexed portfolio." As it turns out, however, there may be good reasons to expect such a result. We explore them in detail in Chapter 11, where we discuss the efficient market hypothesis.

## 4.8 Information on Mutual Funds

The first place to find information on a mutual fund is in its prospectus. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that the prospectus describe the fund's investment objectives and policies in a concise "Statement of Investment Objectives" as well as in lengthy discussions of investment policies and risks. The fund's investment adviser and

Of course, actual funds incur trading costs while indexes do not, so a fair comparison between the returns on actively managed funds versus those on a passive index should first reduce the return on the Wilshire 5000 by an estimate of such costs. Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index portfolio charges an expense ratio of $0.04\%$  (for investments above \$3,000) and, because it engages in little trading, incurs low trading costs. Therefore, it would be reasonable to reduce the returns on the index by no more than $15\%$ . This reduction would not erase the difference in average performance.

its portfolio manager are also described. The prospectus also presents the costs associated with purchasing shares in the fund in a fee table. Sales charges such as front-end and back-end loads as well as annual operating expenses such as management fees and 12b-1 fees are detailed in the fee table.

Funds provide information about themselves in two other sources. The Statement of Additional Information (SAI), also known as Part B of the prospectus, includes a list of the securities in the portfolio at the end of the fiscal year, audited financial statements, a list of the directors and officers of the fund (as well as their personal investments in the fund), and data on brokerage commissions paid by the fund. However, unlike the fund prospectus, investors do not receive the SAI unless they specifically request it; one industry joke is that SAI stands for "something always ignored." The fund's annual report also includes portfolio composition and financial statements, as well as a discussion of the factors that influenced fund performance over the last reporting period.

With thousands of funds to choose from, it can be difficult to find and select the fund best suited for a particular need. Several publications now offer "encyclopedias" of mutual fund information to help in the search process. Morningstar's Web site, www.morningstar.com, is an excellent source of information, as is Yahoo!'s site, finance.yahoo.com/funds. The Investment Company Institute (www.ici.org), the national association of mutual funds, closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts, publishes an annual Directory of Mutual Funds that includes information on fees as well as contact information. To illustrate the range of information available about funds, we consider Morningstar's report on Fidelity's Small Cap Growth Fund, reproduced in Figure 4.5.

The top panel summarizes some of the fund's key characteristics, for example, its expense ratio (1.09\%), turnover rate (126\%), and dividend yield (zero). Included here is Morningstar's famous style box. In it, Morningstar evaluates style along two dimensions: One is the size of the firms held in the portfolio as measured by the market value of outstanding equity; the other is a value/growth measure. Morningstar defines value stocks as those with low ratios of market price per share to various measures of value. It puts stocks on a growth-value continuum based on the ratios of stock price to the firm's earnings, book value, sales, cash flow, and dividends. Value stocks are those with a low price relative to these measures of value. In contrast, growth stocks have high ratios, suggesting that investors in these firms must believe that the firm will experience rapid growth to justify the prices at which the stocks sell. In Figure 4.5, the shaded box in the bottom right of the Investment Style grid shows that Fidelity's Small Cap Fund tends to hold smaller firms (bottom row) and growth stocks (right column).

The bottom panel shows various statistics on the fund's investment performance in each of the last 10 years. You can compare returns to two benchmarks, either the other funds in the same small/growth category or a relevant stock market index, in this case, the Russell 2000 Growth Index. The rows labeled $+/-$ Category or $+/-$ Index present annual return differentials relative to each benchmark. The following rows show the fund's quartile as well as its percentile rank within its comparison group. The fund has been extremely successful, with performance in the top half of its comparison group in every year since 2013. This performance has earned the fund a 4-star rating. Of course, we are all accustomed to the disclaimer that "past performance is not a reliable measure of future results," and this is presumably true as well of Morningstar's star ratings. Indeed, performance so far in 2021 has been disappointing.

More data on the performance of the fund are provided in the graph in the middle of the figure. The top plot shows that an investment in the fund would have accumulated to a total return about $25\%$ greater than the ones provided by either benchmark.

More information on the fund is given in other Morningstar pages.

1. Unit investment trusts, closed-end management companies, and open-end management companies are all classified and regulated as investment companies. Unit investment trusts are essentially unmanaged in the sense that the portfolio, once established, is fixed. Managed investment companies, in contrast, may change the composition of the portfolio as deemed fit by the portfolio manager. Closed-end funds are traded like other securities; they do not redeem shares for their investors. Open-end funds, more commonly known as mutual funds, will redeem shares for net asset value at the request of the investor.
2. Net asset value equals the market value of assets held by a fund minus the liabilities of the fund divided by the shares outstanding.
3. Mutual funds free the individual from many of the administrative burdens of owning individual securities and offer professional management of the portfolio. They also offer advantages that are available only to large-scale investors, such as lower trading costs and easier diversification. On the other hand, funds are assessed management fees and incur other expenses, which reduce the investor's rate of return. Funds also eliminate some of the individual's control over the timing of capital gains realizations.
4. Mutual funds are often categorized by investment policy. Major policy groups include money market funds; equity funds, which are further grouped according to emphasis on income versus growth or specialization by sector; bond funds; international funds; balanced funds; asset allocation funds; and index funds.
5. Costs of investing in mutual funds include front-end loads, which are sales charges; back-end loads, which are redemption fees or, more formally, contingent-deferred sales charges; operating expenses; and 12b-1 charges, which are recurring fees used to pay for the expenses of marketing the fund to the public.
6. Income earned on mutual fund portfolios is not taxed at the level of the fund. Instead, as long as the fund meets certain requirements for pass-through status, the income is treated as being earned by the investors in the fund.
7. The average rate of return of the average equity mutual fund in the last 50 years has been below that of a passive index fund holding a portfolio to replicate a broad-based index like the S&P 500 or Wilshire 5000. Some of the reasons for this disappointing record are the costs incurred by actively managed funds, such as the expense of conducting the research to guide stock-picking activities, and trading costs due to higher portfolio turnover.

1. Would you expect a typical open-end fixed-income mutual fund to have higher or lower operating expenses than a fixed-income unit investment trust? Why?
2. What are some comparative advantages of investing in the following?

a. Unit investment trusts.
b. Open-end mutual funds.
$c$ . Individual stocks and bonds that you choose for yourself.

**PROBLEM SETS**

3. Open-end equity mutual funds commonly keep a small fraction of total investments in very liquid money market assets. Closed-end funds do not have to maintain such a position in "cash-equivalent" securities. What difference between open-end and closed-end funds might account for their differing policies?
4. Balanced funds, life-cycle funds, and asset allocation funds all invest in both the stock and bond markets. What are the differences among these types of funds?
5. Why can closed-end funds sell at prices that differ from net asset value while open-end funds do not?
6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of exchange-traded funds versus mutual funds?
 7. An open-end fund has a net asset value of 10.70 per share. It is sold with a front-end load of $6\%$. What is the offering price?
 8. If the offering price of an open-end fund is 12.30 per share and the fund is sold with a front-end load of $5\%$, what is its net asset value?
9. The composition of the Fingroup Fund portfolio is as follows:

<table><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Shares</td><td>Price</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>200,000</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>300,000</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>400,000</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>600,000</td><td>25</td></tr></table>

The fund has not borrowed any funds, but its accrued management fee with the portfolio manager currently totals 30,000. There are 4 million shares outstanding. What is the net asset value of the fund?

10. Reconsider the Fingroup Fund in the previous problem. If during the year the portfolio manager sells all of the holdings of stock D and replaces it with 200,000 shares of stock E at  \$50 per share and 200,000 shares of stock F at\$ 25 per share, what is the portfolio turnover rate?
 11. The Closed Fund is a closed-end investment company with a portfolio currently worth \$200 million. It has liabilities of \$3 million and 5 million shares outstanding.

a. What is the NAV of the fund?
b. If the fund sells for 36 per share, what is its premium or discount as a percent of net asset value?

12. Corporate Fund started the year with a net asset value of \$12.50. By year-end, its NAV equaled \$12.10. The fund paid year-end distributions of income and capital gains of 1.50. What was the (pretax) rate of return to an investor in the fund?

13. A closed-end fund starts the year with a net asset value of \$12.00. By year-end, NAV equals \$12.10. At the beginning of the year, the fund was selling at a $2\%$ premium to NAV. By the end of the year, the fund is selling at a $7\%$ discount to NAV. The fund paid year-end distributions of income and capital gains of 1.50.

15. Consider a mutual fund with \$200 million in assets at the start of the year and 10 million shares outstanding. The fund invests in a portfolio of stocks that provides dividend income at the end of the year of \$2 million. The stocks included in the fund's portfolio increase in price by $8\%$, but no securities are sold and there are no capital gains distributions. The fund charges 12b-1 fees of $1\%$, which are deducted from portfolio assets at year-end. What is the fund's net asset value at the start and end of the year? What is the rate of return for an investor in the fund?
 16. The New Fund had average daily assets of \$2.2 billion last year. The fund sold \$400 million worth of stock and purchased 500 million during the year. What was its turnover ratio?
17. If New Fund's expense ratio (see the previous problem) was $1.1\%$ and the management fee was $0.7\%$ , what were the total fees paid to the fund's investment managers during the year? What were other administrative expenses?
 18. You purchased 1,000 shares of the New Fund at a price of 20 per share at the beginning of the year. You paid a front-end load of 4\%. The securities in which the fund invests increase in value by $12\%$ during the year. The fund's expense ratio is $1.2\%$. What is your rate of return on the fund if you sell your shares at the end of the year?
19. Loaded-Up Fund charges a 12b-1 fee of $1.0\%$ and maintains an expense ratio of $0.75\%$. Economy Fund charges a front-end load of $2\%$  but has no 12b-1 fee and has an expense ratio of $0.25\%$. Assume the rate of return on both funds' portfolios (before any fees) is $6\%$ per year. How much will an investment in each fund grow to after: a. 1 year?

b. 3 years?
c. 10 years?

20. City Street Fund has a portfolio of \$450 million and liabilities of \$10 million.

$b$ . If a large investor redeems 1 million shares, what happens to the (i) portfolio value, (ii) shares outstanding, and (iii) NAV?

21. The Investments Fund sells Class A shares with a front-end load of $6\%$ and Class C shares with 12b-1 fees of $0.5\%$ annually as well as back-end load fees that start at $5\%$ and fall by $1\%$  for each full year the investor holds the portfolio (until the fifth year). Assume the portfolio rate of return net of operating expenses is $10\%$ annually. If you plan to sell the fund after 4 years, are Class A or Class C shares the better choice for you? What if you plan to sell after 15 years?
22. You are considering an investment in a mutual fund with a $4\%$ load and an expense ratio of $0.5\%$. You can invest instead in a bank CD paying $6\%$ interest.

a. If you plan to invest for 2 years, what annual rate of return must the fund portfolio earn for you to be better off in the fund than in the CD? Assume annual compounding of returns.
b. How does your answer change if you plan to invest for 6 years? Why does your answer change?
c. Now suppose that instead of a front-end load the fund assesses a 12b-1 fee of $0.75\%$ per year. What annual rate of return must the fund portfolio earn for you to be better off in the fund than in the CD? Does your answer in this case depend on your time horizon?

23. Suppose that every time a fund manager trades stock, transaction costs such as commissions and bid-ask spreads amount to $0.4\%$ of the value of the trade. If the portfolio turnover rate is $50\%$ , by how much is the total return of the portfolio reduced by trading costs?
24. You expect a tax-free municipal bond portfolio to provide a rate of return of $4\%$ . Management fees of the fund are $6\%$ . What fraction of portfolio income is given up to fees? If the management fees for an equity fund also are $6\%$, but you expect a portfolio return of $12\%$ , what fraction of portfolio income is given up to fees? Why might management fees be a bigger factor in your investment decision for bond funds than for stock funds? Can your conclusion help explain why unmanaged unit investment trusts tend to focus on the fixed-income market?

**SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS**

1. NAV = $\frac{\$4,034.4 - \$81.8}{101.1} = \$39.10$. The net investment in the Class A shares after the 4\% commission is $9,600. If the fund earns a 10\% return, the investment will grow after n years to \$9,600 × (1.10)n. The Class C shares have no front-end load. However, the net return to the investor after 12b-1 fees will be only $9.5\%$. In addition, there is a back-end load that reduces the sales proceeds by a percentage equal to (5 – years until sale) until the fifth year, when the back-end load expires.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Class A Shares</td><td>Class C Shares</td></tr><tr><td>Horizon</td><td>$9,600 × (1.10)ⁿ</td><td>$10,000 × (1.095)ⁿ × (1 – Percentage exit fee)</td></tr><tr><td>1 year</td><td>$10,560</td><td>$10,000 × (1.095) × (1 – .04) = \$10,512</td></tr><tr><td>4 years</td><td>$14,055</td><td>$10,000 × (1.095)⁴ × (1 – .01) = \$14,233</td></tr><tr><td>10 years</td><td>$24,900</td><td>$10,000 × (1.095)¹⁰ = 24,782</td></tr></table>

For a very short horizon such as 1 year, the Class A shares are the better choice. The front-end and back-end loads are equal, but the Class A shares don't have to pay the 12b-1 fees.

For moderate horizons such as 4 years, the Class C shares dominate because the front-end load of the Class A shares is more costly than the 12b-1 fees and the now-smaller exit fee. For long horizons of 10 years or more, Class A again dominates. In this case, the one-time front-end load is less expensive than the continuing 12b-1 fees.

3. a. Turnover = \$160,000 in trades per \$1 million of portfolio value = $16\%$.

b. Realized capital gains are $25 \times 400 = \$10,000$ on Etsy and $10 \times 1,600 = \$16,000$ on Cisco. The tax owed on the capital gains is therefore $0.20 \times \$26,000 = \$5,200$.
