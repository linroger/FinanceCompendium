THE EFFICIENT MARKET hypothesis makes two important predictions. First, it implies that security prices properly reflect whatever information is available to investors. A second implication follows immediately: Active traders will find it difficult to outperform passive strategies such as holding market indexes. To do so would require differential insight; in a highly competitive market, this is hard to come by.

Unfortunately, it is hard to devise measures of the "true" or intrinsic value of a security and correspondingly difficult to test directly whether prices match those values. Therefore, most tests of market efficiency have focused on the performance of active trading strategies. These tests have been of two kinds. The anomalies literature has examined strategies that apparently would have provided superior risk-adjusted returns (e.g., investing in stocks with momentum or in value rather than glamour stocks). Other tests have looked at the results of actual investments by asking whether professional managers have been able to beat the market.

Neither class of tests has proven fully conclusive. The anomalies literature suggests that several strategies would have provided superior returns. But there are questions as to whether some of these apparent anomalies reflect risk premiums not captured by simple models of risk and return or even if some merely reflect data mining. Moreover, the apparent inability of the typical money manager to turn these anomalies into reliably superior returns on actual portfolios casts additional doubt on their "reality."


Behavioral finance argues that the sprawling literature on trading strategies has missed a larger and more important point by overlooking the first implication of efficient markets—the correctness of security prices. This may be the more important implication because market economies rely on prices to allocate resources efficiently. The behavioral school argues that even if security prices are wrong, exploiting them still can be difficult and, therefore, the failure to uncover obviously successful trading rules or traders cannot be taken as proof of market efficiency.

Whereas conventional theories treat investors as rational, behavioral finance starts with the presumption that they are not. We will examine some of the information-processing and behavioral irrationalities uncovered by psychologists in other contexts and show how these tendencies applied to financial markets might result in some of the anomalies discussed in the previous chapter. We then consider the limitations of strategies designed to take advantage of behaviorally induced mispricing. If the limits to such arbitrage activity are severe, mispricing can survive even if some rational investors attempt to exploit it. We turn next to technical analysis and show how behavioral models give some support to techniques that clearly would be useless in efficient


markets. We close the chapter with a brief survey of some of these technical strategies.

# 12.1 The Behavioral Critique

The premise of behavioral finance is that conventional financial theory ignores how real people make decisions and that people make a difference. A growing number of economists have come to interpret the anomalies literature as consistent with several "irrationalities" that seem to characterize individuals making complicated decisions. These irrationalities fall into two broad categories: first, that investors do not always process information correctly and therefore infer incorrect probability distributions about future rates of return; and second, that even given a probability distribution of returns, they often make inconsistent or systematically suboptimal decisions.

Of course, the existence of irrational investors would not by itself be sufficient to render capital markets inefficient. If such irrationalities did affect prices, then sharp-eyed arbitrageurs taking advantage of profit opportunities might be expected to push prices back to their proper values. Thus, the second leg of the behavioral critique is that in practice the actions of such arbitrageurs are limited and therefore insufficient to force prices to intrinsic value.

This leg of the argument is important. Virtually everyone agrees that if prices are right (i.e., price = intrinsic value), then there are no easy profit opportunities. But the reverse is not necessarily true. If behaviorists are correct about limits to arbitrage activity, then the absence of profit opportunities does not necessarily imply that markets are efficient. We've noted that most tests of the efficient market hypothesis have focused on the existence of profit opportunities, often as reflected in the performance of money managers. But their failure to systematically outperform passive investment strategies need not imply that markets are actually efficient, with price equal to intrinsic value.

We will start our summary of the behavioral critique with the first leg of the argument, surveying a sample of the informational processing errors uncovered by psychologists in other areas. We next examine a few of the behavioral irrationalities that seem to characterize decision makers. Finally, we look at limits to arbitrage activity and conclude with a tentative assessment of the import of the behavioral debate.

# Information Processing

Errors in information processing can lead investors to misestimate the true probabilities of possible events or associated rates of return. Several such biases have been uncovered. Here are five of the more important ones.

The discussion in this section is largely based on Nicholas Barberis and Richard Thaler, "A Survey of Behavioral Finance," in Handbook of the Economics of Finance, ed. G. M. Constantinides, M. Harris, and R. Stulz (Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2003); and David Hirshleifer, "Behavioral Finance," Annual Review of Financial Economics 7 (2015), pp. 133-59.

Limited Attention, Underreaction, and Overreaction Individuals have limited time and attention and as a result may rely on rules of thumb or intuitive decision-making procedures known as heuristics. Limited analytic processing capacity may also cause them to overreact to salient or attention-grabbing news and underreact to less salient information.

These sorts of limitations would be consistent with the accruals anomaly reported by Sloan $^2$  that we noted in the last chapter. If investors pay attention to "headline" earnings announcements, but comparatively neglect the less apparent extent to which accruals management has been used to manipulate reported earnings, then high current accruals (which artificially inflate reported earnings) will be a predictor of poor future returns (when the impact of that earnings management is eventually recognized). This is an example of investor underreaction to the information contained in accruals.

Recent events are typically more salient to investors, and this salience can lead to overreaction rather than underreaction biases. For example, when investors react to positive recent earnings news, they may overweight its significance and project performance too far into the future. De Bondt and Thaler argue that this can result in a high initial P/E (due to the excessive optimism built into the stock price) and poor subsequent performance when investors recognize their error. Thus, high P/E firms tend to be poor investments.

Overconfidence People tend to overestimate the precision of their beliefs or forecasts, and they tend to overestimate their abilities. In one famous survey,  $90\%$  of drivers in Sweden ranked themselves as better-than-average drivers. Such overconfidence may be responsible for the prevalence of active versus passive investment management—itself an anomaly to adherents of the efficient market hypothesis. Despite the growing popularity of indexing, only about  $40\%$  of the assets in mutual and exchange-traded funds are held in indexed accounts. The continued prevalence of active management in the face of the typical underperformance of such strategies (consider the generally disappointing performance of actively managed mutual funds reviewed in Chapter 4 as well as in the previous chapter) is consistent with a tendency to overestimate ability.

An interesting example of overconfidence in financial markets is provided by Barber and Odean, who compare trading activity and average returns in brokerage accounts of men and women. They find that men (in particular, single men) trade far more actively than women, consistent with the generally greater overconfidence among men documented in the psychology literature. They also find that trading activity is highly predictive of poor investment performance. The top  $20\%$  of accounts ranked by portfolio turnover had average returns 7 percentage points lower than the  $20\%$  of the accounts with the lowest turnover rates. As they conclude, "trading [and by implication, overconfidence] is hazardous to your wealth."

Lest you think these findings were just a statistical fluke, Fidelity replicated these studies using 5.2 million of its own customer accounts for the decade ending in 2020 and found

2R. G. Sloan, "Do Stock Prices Fully Reflect Information in Accruals and Cash Flows About Future Earnings?", Accounting Review 71 (2006), pp. 289-315.
 Just as overconfidence can degrade portfolio investments, it also can lead such firms to make poor investments in real assets.

Conservatism A conservatism bias means that investors are too slow (too conservative) in updating their beliefs in response to new evidence. This means that they might initially underreact to news about a firm so that prices will fully reflect new information only gradually. Such a bias would give rise to momentum in stock market returns.

Confirmation Bias Confirmation bias is the tendency to interpret new information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs. This bias causes people to emphasize signals that support their views and, symmetrically, to comparatively disregard information that would call those views into question.

Friesen, Weller, and Dunham point out that this sort of bias could lead to both momentum and reversal anomalies. For example, suppose traders have come to a positive view on prospects for the stock market. If they then receive more ambiguous signals about future performance, they will be prone to interpret those signals too optimistically (confirming their current beliefs) and therefore will further drive up prices. This leads to a short-term momentum property. Eventually, however, as information continues to arrive and beliefs are nudged in a more rational direction, those price gains will be corrected, leading to a reversal effect.

In fact, with a richer set of signals, for example, signals that come with different information content and at different frequencies, confirmation bias and its eventual but inevitable dissipation can generate even more complicated stock price patterns. Interestingly, one is the head-and-shoulders pattern that has a long tradition in technical analysis (see Figure 12.6 and the accompanying discussion later in this chapter).

Geoffrey C. Friesen, Paul A. Weller, and Lee M. Dunham, "Price Trends and Patterns in Technical Analysis: A Theoretical and Empirical Examination," Journal of Banking and Finance 33 (2009), pp. 1089-100.

While confirmation bias is not his focus, Shiller makes a point related to it in his discussion of the potential for market bubbles or fads. He notes that people regularly appear to suppress certain facts and amplify others if doing so fits into their point of view. The willingness to focus disproportionately on supportive facts means that investors can be "buffeted en masse from one superficially plausible theory about valuation to another" and that "investing ideas can spread like epidemics."

Extrapolation and Pattern Recognition People are adept at discerning patterns, sometimes even perceiving patterns that may be illusory. They also are overly prone to believe, even when employing only limited evidence, that these patterns are likely to characterize an entire population, especially if the small sample exhibits other (even possibly irrelevant) similarities with a broad population. This sort of error is called representativeness bias, and it holds that people commonly act as if a small sample is just as informative about a population as a large one. They therefore infer a pattern too quickly based on a small sample and extrapolate apparent trends too far into the future. It is easy to see how such a pattern would be consistent with momentum and reversal anomalies. A short-lived run of good earnings reports or high stock returns leads such investors to revise their assessments of likely future performance and thus generate buying pressure that exaggerates the price run-up. Eventually, the gap between price and intrinsic value becomes glaring and the market corrects its initial error. Interestingly, stocks with the best recent performance suffer reversals precisely in the few days surrounding management earnings forecasts or actual earnings announcements, suggesting that the correction occurs just as investors learn that their initial beliefs were too extreme.[9]

# Concept Check 12.1

We saw in Chapter 11 that stocks seem to exhibit a pattern of short- to middle-term momentum, along with long-term reversals. How might this pattern arise from an interplay between the conservatism and representativeness biases?

# Behavioral Biases

Even if information processing were perfect, many studies conclude that individuals would tend to make less-than-fully-rational decisions using that information. These behavioral biases largely affect how investors frame questions of risk versus return and, therefore, make risk-return trade-offs.

Framing Decisions seem to be affected by how choices are framed. For example, an individual may reject a bet when it is posed in terms of the risk surrounding possible gains but may accept that same bet when described in terms of the risk surrounding potential losses. In other words, individuals may act risk averse in terms of gains but risk seeking in terms of losses. But in many cases, the choice of how to frame a risky venture—as involving gains or losses—can be arbitrary.

# Example 12.1 Framing

Consider a coin toss with a payoff of  \$50 for tails. Now consider a gift of\$ 50 that is bundled with a bet that imposes a loss of \$50 if that coin toss comes up heads. In both cases, you end up with zero for heads and \$50 for tails. But the former description frames the coin toss as posing a risky gain, while the latter frames the coin toss in terms of a risky loss. The difference in framing can lead to different attitudes toward the risky payoff.

Mental Accounting Mental accounting is a specific form of framing in which people segregate certain decisions. For example, an investor may take a lot of risk with one investment account but establish a very conservative position with another account that is dedicated to her child's education. Rationally, it might be better to view both accounts as part of the investor's overall portfolio with the risk-return profiles of each integrated into a unified framework. Nevertheless, Shefrin and Statman point out that a central distinction between conventional and behavioral finance theory is that the behavioral approach views investors as building their portfolios in "distinct mental account layers in a pyramid of assets," where each layer may be tied to particular goals and elicit different levels of risk aversion.

In another paper, Shefrin and Statman argue that behavioral motives are consistent with some investors' irrational preference for stocks with high cash dividends (they feel free to spend dividend income but would not "dip into capital" by selling a few shares of another stock with the same total rate of return) and with a tendency to ride losing stock positions for too long (because "behavioral investors" are reluctant to realize losses). In fact, there is considerable evidence that investors are more prone to sell stocks with gains than those with losses, precisely contrary to a tax-minimization strategy. This reluctance to realize losses is called the disposition effect.

Mental accounting also can help explain momentum in stock prices. The house money effect refers to gamblers' greater willingness to accept new bets if they currently are ahead. They think of (i.e., frame) the bet as being made with their "winnings account," that is, with the casino's money rather than their own, and thus they are more willing to accept risk. Analogously, after a stock market run-up, individuals may view investments as largely funded out of a "capital gains account," become more tolerant of risk, discount future cash flows at a lower rate, and thus further push up prices.

Regret Avoidance Psychologists have found that individuals who make decisions that turn out badly have more regret (blame themselves more) when that decision was more unconventional. For example, buying a blue-chip portfolio that turns down is not as painful as experiencing the same losses on an unknown start-up firm. Any losses on the blue-chip stocks can be more easily attributed to bad luck rather than bad decision making and

cause less regret. De Bondt and Thaler argue that such regret avoidance is consistent with both the size and book-to-market effects. Higher book-to-market firms tend to have depressed stock prices. These firms are "out of favor" and more likely to be in a financially precarious position. Similarly, smaller, less well-known firms are also less conventional investments. Such firms require more "courage" on the part of the investor, which increases the required rate of return. Mental accounting can add to this effect. If investors focus on the gains or losses of individual stocks, rather than on broad portfolios, they can become more risk averse concerning stocks with recent poor performance, discount their cash flows at a higher rate, and thereby create a value-stock risk premium.

# Concept Check 12.2

How might the P/E effect (discussed in the previous chapter) also be explained as a consequence of regret avoidance?

Affect and Feelings Conventional models of portfolio choice focus on asset risk and return. But behavioral finance focuses as well on affect, which is a feeling of "good" or "bad" that consumers may attach to a potential purchase or investors to a stock. For example, firms with reputations for socially responsible policies or attractive working conditions or those producing popular products may generate higher affect in public perception. If investors favor stocks with good affect, that might drive up prices and drive down average rates of return. Statman, Fisher, and Anginer looked for evidence that affect influences security pricing. They found that stocks ranked high in Fortune's survey of most admired companies (i.e., with high affect) tend to have lower average risk-adjusted returns than the least admired firms, suggesting that their prices have been bid up relative to their underlying profitability, and, therefore, that their expected future returns are lower.

Affect might also be an explanation for the home country bias, the empirical tendency for investors to overweight shares in their home markets compared to an efficient diversification strategy. Psychologists have documented that people prefer familiar settings about which they feel like they have more information. Given this, they might well give up some diversification to focus on home markets where they subjectively perceive less uncertainty.

Prospect Theory Prospect theory modifies the analytic description of rational risk-averse investors found in standard financial theory.[15] Figure 12.1, Panel A, illustrates the conventional description of a risk-averse investor. Higher wealth provides higher satisfaction, or "utility," but at a diminishing rate (the curve flattens as the individual becomes wealthier). This gives rise to risk aversion: A gain of  \$1,000 increases utility by less than a loss of\$ 1,000 reduces it; therefore, investors will reject risky prospects that don't offer a risk premium.

B: Utility Function under Prospect Theory
Figure 12.1 Prospect theory. Panel A: A conventional utility function is defined in terms of wealth and is concave, resulting in risk aversion. Panel B: Under loss aversion, the utility function is defined in terms of losses relative to current wealth. It is also convex to the left of the origin, giving rise to risk-seeking behavior in terms of losses.

Figure 12.1, Panel B, shows a competing description of preferences characterized by "loss aversion." Utility depends not on the level of wealth, as in Panel A, but on changes in wealth from current levels. Moreover, to the left of zero (zero denotes no change from current wealth), the curve is convex rather than concave. This description of investor utility has several implications. Whereas many conventional utility functions imply that investors may become less risk averse as wealth increases, the function in Panel B always re-centers on current wealth, thereby ruling out such decreases in risk aversion and possibly helping to explain high average historical equity risk premiums. Moreover, the convex curvature to the left of the origin in Panel B will induce investors to be risk seeking rather than risk averse when it comes to losses. Consistent with loss aversion, traders in T-bond futures contracts have been observed to assume significantly greater risk in afternoon sessions following morning sessions in which they have lost money.[16]

# Limits to Arbitrage

Behavioral biases would not matter for stock pricing if rational arbitrageurs could fully exploit the mistakes of behavioral investors. Trades of profit-seeking investors would correct any misalignment between price and intrinsic value. However, behavioral advocates argue that, in practice, several factors limit the ability to profit from mispricing.[17]

Fundamental Risk Suppose that a share of Amazon is underpriced. Buying it may present a profit opportunity, but it is hardly risk-free because the presumed market underpricing can get worse. While price eventually should converge to intrinsic value, this may not happen until after the trader's investment horizon. For example, the investor may be

Some of the more influential references on limits to arbitrage are J. B. DeLong, A. Schleifer, L. Summers, and R. Waldmann, “Noise Trader Risk in Financial Markets,” Journal of Political Economy 98 (August 1990), pp. 704–38; and A. Schleifer and R. Vishny, “The Limits of Arbitrage,” Journal of Finance 52 (March 1997), pp. 35–55.

a mutual fund manager who may lose clients (not to mention a job!) if short-term performance is disappointing, or may be a trader whose portfolio can be decimated if investment performance is poor, even temporarily. A comment often attributed to the famous economist John Maynard Keynes is that "markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent." The fundamental risk incurred in exploiting apparent profit opportunities presumably will limit the activity of traders.

# Example 12.2 Fundamental Risk

In 2010, the NASDAQ index fluctuated at a level around 2,300. From that perspective, the value the index had reached in March 2000, around 5,000, seemed obviously crazy. Surely some investors living through the Internet "bubble" of the late 1990s must have identified the index as grossly overvalued, suggesting a good selling opportunity. But this hardly would have been a riskless arbitrage opportunity. Consider that NASDAQ may also have been "obviously" overvalued in January 2000 when it crossed above 4,000. An investor in January who believed that NASDAQ was overvalued at 4,000 and decided to sell it short would have suffered enormous losses as the index quickly increased by another 1,000 points before peaking in March. NASDAQ did finally crash, falling below 1,200 in late 2002. While one might have derived considerable satisfaction at eventually being proven right about the overpricing, by entering just a few months before the market "corrected," the investor might also have gone broke.

Implementation Costs Exploiting overpricing can be particularly difficult. Short-selling a security entails costs; short-sellers may have to return the borrowed security on little notice, rendering the horizon of the short sale uncertain. The cost of borrowing shares to initiate a short sale can fluctuate dramatically; sometimes, there are simply no shares available for borrowing, so it is not even possible to enter into a short sale. Other investors, such as many pension or mutual fund managers, face strict limits on their discretion to short securities. These impediments can limit the ability of arbitrage activity to force prices to fair value.

Model Risk One always has to worry that an apparent profit opportunity is more apparent than real. Perhaps you are using a faulty model to value the security, and the price actually is right. Mispricing may make a position a good bet, but it is still a risky one, which limits the extent to which it will be pursued.

# Limits to Arbitrage and the Law of One Price

While one can debate the implications of much of the anomalies literature, surely the Law of One Price (positing that effectively identical assets should have identical prices) should be satisfied in rational markets. Yet there are several instances where the law seems to have been violated. These instances are good case studies of the limits to arbitrage.

"Siamese Twin" Companies In 1907, Royal Dutch Petroleum and Shell Transport merged their operations into one firm. The two original companies, which continued to trade separately, agreed to split all profits from the joint company on a 60/40 basis. Shareholders of Royal Dutch receive  $60\%$  of the cash flow, and those of Shell receive  $40\%$ . One would therefore expect that Royal Dutch should sell for exactly  $60/40 = 1.5$  times the price of Shell. But this is not the case. Figure 12.2 shows that the relative value of the two firms has departed considerably from this "parity" ratio for extended periods of time.

Figure 12.2 Pricing of Royal Dutch relative to Shell (deviation from parity)

Doesn't this mispricing give rise to an arbitrage opportunity? If Royal Dutch sells for more than 1.5 times Shell, why not buy relatively underpriced Shell and short sell overpriced Royal? This seems like a reasonable strategy, but if you had followed it in February 1993 when Royal sold for about  $10\%$  more than its parity value, Figure 12.2 shows that you would have lost a lot of money as the premium widened to about  $17\%$  before finally reversing after 1999. As in Example 12.2, this opportunity posed fundamental risk.

Equity Carve-Outs Several equity carve-outs also have violated the Law of One Price.[19] To illustrate, consider the case of 3Com, which in 1999 decided to spin off its Palm division. It first sold  $5\%$  of its stake in Palm in an IPO, announcing that it would distribute the remaining  $95\%$  of its Palm shares to 3Com shareholders six months later in a spinoff. Each 3Com shareholder would receive 1.5 shares of Palm in the spinoff.

Once Palm shares began trading, but prior to the spinoff, the share price of 3Com should have been at least 1.5 times that of Palm. After all, each share of 3Com entitled its owner to 1.5 shares of Palm plus an ownership stake in a profitable company. Instead, Palm shares at the IPO actually sold for more than the 3Com shares. The stub value of 3Com (i.e., the value of each 3Com share net of the value of the claim to Palm represented by that share) could be computed as the price of 3Com minus 1.5 times the price of Palm. This calculation, however, implies that 3Com's stub value was negative, despite the fact that it was a profitable company with cash assets alone of about 10 per share.

Again, an arbitrage strategy seems obvious. Why not buy 3Com and sell Palm? The limit to arbitrage in this case was the inability of investors to sell Palm short. Virtually all available shares in Palm were already borrowed and sold short, and the negative stub values persisted for more than two months.

Closed-End Funds We noted in Chapter 4 that closed-end funds often sell for substantial discounts or premiums from net asset value. This is "nearly" a violation of the Law of One Price because one would expect the value of the fund to equal the value of the shares it holds. We say nearly because, in practice, there are a few wedges between the value of the closed-end fund and its underlying assets. One is expenses. The fund incurs expenses that ultimately are paid for by investors, and these will reduce share price. On the other hand, if managers can invest fund assets to generate positive risk-adjusted returns, share price might exceed net asset value.

Lee, Shleifer, and Thaler argue that the patterns of discounts and premiums on closed-end funds are driven by changes in investor sentiment. They note that discounts on various funds move together and are correlated with the return on small stocks, suggesting that all are affected by common variation in sentiment. One might consider buying funds selling at a discount from net asset value and selling those trading at a premium, but discounts and premiums can widen, subjecting this strategy to fundamental risk. Pontiff demonstrates that deviations of price from net asset value in closed-end funds tend to be higher in funds that are more difficult to arbitrage, for example, those with more idiosyncratic volatility.

However, closed-end fund discounts may also be examples of apparent anomalies that have alternative rational explanations. Ross points out that they can be reconciled with rational investors even if expenses or fund abnormal returns are modest.[22] He shows that if a fund has a dividend yield of  $\delta$ , an alpha (risk-adjusted abnormal return) of  $\alpha$ , and an expense ratio of  $\varepsilon$ , then using the constant-growth dividend discount model (see Chapter 18), the premium of the fund over its net asset value will be

$$
\frac {\text {P r i c e} - \text {N A V}}{\text {N A V}} = \frac {\alpha - \varepsilon}{\delta + \varepsilon - \alpha}
$$

If the fund manager's performance more than compensates for expenses (i.e., if  $\alpha > \varepsilon$ ), the fund will sell at a premium to NAV; otherwise, it will sell at a discount. For example, suppose  $\alpha = .015$ , the expense ratio is  $\varepsilon = .0125$ , and the dividend yield is  $\delta = .02$ . Then the premium will be .14, or  $14\%$ . But if the market turns sour on the manager and revises its estimate of  $\alpha$  downward to .005, that premium quickly turns into a discount of  $27\%$ .

This analysis might explain the pattern of premiums and discounts in closed-end funds; if investors expect a sufficiently large  $\alpha$ , they will purchase shares at a premium. But the fact that most premiums eventually turn into discounts indicates how difficult it is for management to fulfill these expectations.[23]

# Concept Check 12.3

Fundamental risk may be limited by a "deadline" that forces a convergence between price and intrinsic value. What do you think would happen to a closed-end fund's discount if the fund were to announce that it planned to liquidate in six months, at which time it would distribute NAV to its shareholders?

In Example 12.2, we pointed out that the stock market run-up of the late 1990s, and even more spectacularly, the run-up of the technology-heavy NASDAQ market, seems in retrospect to have been an obvious bubble. In a six-year period beginning in 1995, the NASDAQ index increased by a factor of more than 6. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan famously characterized the dot-com boom as an example of "irrational exuberance," and his assessment turned out to be correct: By October 2002, the index fell to less than one-fourth the peak value it had reached only  $2 \frac{1}{2}$  years earlier.

This episode seems to be a case in point for advocates of the behavioral school, exemplifying a market moved by irrational investor sentiment. Moreover, in accord with behavioral patterns, as the dot-com boom developed, it seemed to feed on itself, with investors increasingly confident of their investment prowess (overconfidence bias) and apparently willing to extrapolate short-term patterns into the distant future (representativeness bias).

Only five years later, another bubble, this time in housing prices, was underway. As in the dot-com bubble, prospects of further price increases fueled speculative demand by purchasers. Shortly thereafter, of course, housing prices stalled and then fell. The bursting bubble set off the worst financial crisis in 75 years.

Bubbles are a lot easier to identify as such once they are over. While they are going on, irrational exuberance is less obvious, and indeed, many financial commentators during the dot-com bubble justified the boom as consistent with glowing forecasts for the "new economy." A simple example shows how hard it can be to tie down the fair value of stock investments.[24]

# Example 12.3 A Stock Market Bubble?

In 2000, near the peak of the dot-com boom, the dividends paid by the firms included in the S&P 500 totaled \$154.6 million. If the discount rate for the index was  $9.2\%$  and the expected dividend growth rate was  $8\%$ , the value of these shares according to the constant-growth dividend discount model (see Chapter 18 for more on this model) would be

$$
\text {V a l u e} = \frac {\text {D i v i d e n d}}{\text {D i s c o u n t r a t e - G r o w t h r a t e}} = \frac {\mathbb {1 5 4 . 6}}{. 0 9 2 -. 0 8} = \mathbb {1 2 , 8 8 3 m i l l o n}
$$

This was quite close to the actual total value of those firms at the time. But the estimate is highly sensitive to the input values, and even a small reassessment of their prospects would result in a big revision of price. Suppose the expected dividend growth rate fell to  $7.4\%$ . This would reduce the value of the index to

$$
\text {V a l u e} = \frac {\text {D i v i d e n d}}{\text {D i s c o u n t r a t e - G r o w t h r a t e}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 5 4 . 6}{. 0 9 2 -. 0 7 4} = \mathbb {S} 8, 5 8 9 \text {m i l l i o n}
$$ which was about the value to which the S&P 500 firms had fallen by October 2002. In light of this example, the run-up and crash of the 1990s seem easier to reconcile with rational behavior.


Still, other evidence seems to tag the dot-com boom as at least partially irrational. Consider, for example, the results of a study documenting that firms adding “.com” to the end of their names during this period enjoyed a meaningful stock price increase.[25] That doesn’t sound like rational valuation.

# Evaluating the Behavioral Critique

As investors, we are concerned with the existence of profit opportunities. The behavioral explanations of efficient market anomalies do not always give guidance as to how to exploit any irrationality.

However, as we emphasized above, one of the important implications of the efficient market hypothesis is that security prices serve as reliable guides to the allocation of real assets. If prices are distorted, then capital markets will give misleading signals (and incentives) as to where the economy may best allocate resources. In this crucial dimension, the behavioral critique of the efficient market hypothesis is certainly important irrespective of any implication for investment strategies.

There is considerable debate among financial economists concerning behavioral finance. Many believe that it is too unstructured, allowing too many anomalies to be explained by some combination of irrationalities chosen from a laundry list of behavioral biases. While it is easy to "reverse engineer" a behavioral explanation for any particular anomaly, these critics would like to see a consistent or unified behavioral theory that can explain a range of behavioral anomalies.

More fundamentally, others are not convinced that the anomalies literature as a whole is a convincing indictment of the efficient market hypothesis. Fama notes that the anomalies are inconsistent in terms of their support for one type of irrationality versus another. For example, some papers document long-term corrections (consistent with overreaction), while others document long-term continuations of abnormal returns (consistent with underreaction). Moreover, the statistical significance of many of these results is hard to assess. Even small errors in choosing a benchmark against which to compare returns can cumulate to large apparent abnormalities in long-term returns.

The behavioral critique of full rationality in investor decision making is well taken, but the extent to which limited rationality affects asset pricing remains controversial. Whether or not investor irrationality affects asset prices, however, behavioral finance already makes important points about portfolio management. Investors who are aware of the potential pitfalls in information processing and decision making that seem to characterize their peers should be better able to avoid such errors. Ironically, the insights of behavioral finance may lead to some of the same policy conclusions embraced by efficient market advocates. For example, an easy way to avoid some of the behavioral minefields is to pursue passive, largely indexed, portfolio strategies. It seems that only rare individuals can consistently beat passive strategies; this conclusion may hold true whether your fellow investors are behavioral or rational.

# 12.2 Technical Analysis and Behavioral Finance

Technical analysis attempts to exploit recurring and predictable patterns in stock prices to generate superior investment performance. Technicians do not deny the value of fundamental information, but they believe that prices only gradually close in on intrinsic value. As fundamentals shift, astute traders can exploit the adjustment to a new equilibrium.

For example, one of the best-documented behavioral tendencies is the disposition effect, which refers to the tendency of investors to hold on to losing investments. Until the stock is sold and the loss is realized, the investor perceives only a "paper loss," which is more easily ignored. This disposition effect can lead to momentum in stock prices even if fundamental values follow a random walk.[27] The fact that the demand of "disposition investors" for a company's shares depends on the price history of those shares means that prices could close in on fundamental values only over time, consistent with the central motivation of technical analysis.

Behavioral biases may also be consistent with technical analysts' use of volume data. An important behavioral trait noted above is overconfidence, a systematic tendency to overestimate one's abilities. As traders become overconfident, they may trade more, inducing an association between trading volume and market returns.[28] Technical analysis thus uses volume data as well as price history to direct trading strategy.

Finally, technicians believe that market fundamentals can be perturbed by irrational or behavioral factors, sometimes labeled sentiment variables. More or less random price fluctuations will accompany any underlying price trend, creating opportunities to exploit corrections as these fluctuations dissipate. For example, we noted earlier that behavioral biases, for example confirmation bias, have the potential to generate some of the patterns that technical analysts claim actually characterize price patterns.

# Trends and Corrections

Much of technical analysis seeks to uncover trends in market prices. This is in effect a search for momentum. Momentum can be absolute, in which case one searches for upward price trends, or relative, in which case the analyst looks to invest in one sector over another (or even take on a long-short position in the two sectors). Relative strength statistics are designed to uncover these potential opportunities.

Momentum and Moving Averages While we all would like to buy shares in firms whose prices are trending upward, this begs the question of how to identify the underlying direction of prices, if in fact such trends actually exist. A popular tool used for this purpose is the moving average.

The moving average of a stock price is the average price over a given interval, where that interval is updated as time passes. For example, a 25-day moving average traces the average price over the previous 25 days. The average is recomputed each day by dropping

the oldest observation and adding the newest. Figure 12.3 is a moving average chart for Intel. Notice that the moving average (the solid red curve) is a "smoothed" version of the original data series (the dashed blue curve).

After a period in which prices have been falling, the moving average will be above the current price (because the moving average continues to average in the older and higher prices until they leave the sample period). In contrast, when prices have been rising, the moving average will be below the current price.

Prices breaking through the moving average from below, as at point A in Figure 12.3, are taken as a bullish signal because this signifies a shift from a falling trend (with prices below the moving average) to a rising trend (with prices above the moving average). Conversely, when prices drop below the moving average, as at point B, analysts might conclude that market momentum has become negative.

# Example 12.4 Moving Averages

Consider the following price data. Each observation represents the closing level of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) on the last trading day of the week. The 5-week moving average for each week is the average of the DJIA over the previous 5 weeks. For example, the first entry, for week 5, is the average of the index value between weeks 1 and 5: 34,290, 34,380, 34,399, 34,379, and 34,450. The next entry is the average of the index values between weeks 2 and 6, and so on.

<table><tr><td>Week</td><td>DJIA</td><td>5-Week Moving Average</td><td>Week</td><td>DJIA</td><td>5-Week Moving Average</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>34,290</td><td></td><td>11</td><td>34,590</td><td>34,555</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>34,380</td><td></td><td>12</td><td>34,652</td><td>34,586</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>34,399</td><td></td><td>13</td><td>34,625</td><td>34,598</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>34,379</td><td></td><td>14</td><td>34,657</td><td>34,624</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>34,450</td><td>34,380</td><td>15</td><td>34,699</td><td>34,645</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>34,513</td><td>34,424</td><td>16</td><td>34,647</td><td>34,656</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>34,500</td><td>34,448</td><td>17</td><td>34,610</td><td>34,648</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>34,565</td><td>34,481</td><td>18</td><td>34,595</td><td>34,642</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>34,524</td><td>34,510</td><td>19</td><td>34,499</td><td>34,610</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>34,597</td><td>34,540</td><td>20</td><td>34,466</td><td>34,563</td></tr></table>

Figure 12.4 plots the level of the index and the 5-week moving average. Notice that while the index itself moves up and down rather abruptly, the moving average is a relatively smooth series because the impact of each week's price movement is averaged with that of the previous weeks. Week 16 is a bearish point according to the moving average rule. The price series crosses from above the moving average to below it, signifying the beginning of a downward trend in stock prices.

Other techniques also are used to uncover potential momentum in stock prices. Two of the more famous ones are Elliott wave theory and Kondratieff waves. Both posit the existence of long-term trends in stock market prices that may be disturbed by shorter-term trends as well as daily fluctuations of little importance. Elliott wave theory superimposes long-term and short-term wave cycles in an attempt to describe the complicated pattern of actual price movements. Once the longer-term waves are identified, investors presumably can buy when the long-term direction of the market is positive. While there is considerable noise in the actual evolution of stock prices, by properly interpreting the wave cycles, one can, according to the theory, predict broad movements.

Similarly, Kondratieff waves are named after a Russian economist who asserted that the macroeconomy (and therefore the stock market) moves in broad waves lasting between 48 and 60 years. Kondratieff's assertion is hard to evaluate empirically, however, because cycles that last about 50 years provide only two independent observations per century, which is hardly enough data to test the predictive power of the theory.

Relative Strength Relative strength measures the extent to which a security has outperformed or underperformed either the market as a whole or its particular industry. Relative strength is computed by calculating the ratio of the price of the security to a price index for the industry. For example, the relative strength of Toyota versus the auto industry would be measured by movements in the ratio of the price of Toyota divided by the level of an auto industry index. A rising ratio implies Toyota has been outperforming the rest of the industry. If relative strength can be assumed to persist over time, then this would be a signal to buy Toyota.

Similarly, the strength of an industry relative to the whole market can be computed by tracking the ratio of the industry price index to the market price index.

Breadth The breadth of the market is a measure of the extent to which movement in a market index is reflected widely in the price movements of all the stocks in the market. The most common measure of breadth is the spread between the number of stocks that advance and decline in price. If advances outnumber declines by a wide margin, then the market is viewed as being stronger because the rally is widespread. These numbers are reported in The Wall Street Journal (see Figure 12.5).

Some analysts cumulate breadth data each day as in Table 12.1. The cumulative breadth for each day is obtained by adding that day's net advances (or declines) to the previous day's total. The direction of the cumulated series is then used to discern broad market trends. Analysts might use a moving average of cumulative breadth to gauge broad trends.

<table><tr><td>Day</td><td>Advances</td><td>Declines</td><td>Net Advances</td><td>Cumulative Breadth</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1,302</td><td>1,248</td><td>54</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1,417</td><td>1,140</td><td>277</td><td>331</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1,203</td><td>1,272</td><td>-69</td><td>262</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1,012</td><td>1,622</td><td>-610</td><td>-348</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>1,133</td><td>1,504</td><td>-371</td><td>-719</td></tr></table>

Note: The sum of advances plus declines varies across days because some stock prices are unchanged.

# Machine Learning and Technical Analysis

Machine learning is not commonly classified as a form of technical analysis. But if one defines technical analysis as the use of past patterns in prices (and other trading data) to forecast profitable trades going forward, then one can make the case that they are at the very least related. In this regard, it is worth looking at one of the most successful hedge funds in history, Renaissance Technologies. Its signature Medallion fund generated average annual returns (before fees) as high as  $66\%$  per year between 1988 and 2018.[29] Even after fees, its very fortunate investors enjoyed average returns of  $39\%$ .

Renaissance is notoriously secretive about the details of its trading strategies. But it appears that they are driven in part by techniques that, at least in concept, would feel familiar to a technical analyst. Think about a simple pairs trade as an example. In this strategy, if prices of two stocks that typically move together (e.g., Coke and Pepsi) begin to diverge, one might buy the stock that has fared relatively poorly and sell the better-performing firm, wagering that the performance discrepancy will reverse. This is a version of a classic correction strategy from the technical analysis tool kit. It searches for possibly slight price misalignments that on average tend to dissipate.

Renaissance appears to have put this approach on steroids. The firm collects unimaginable amounts of data, not just on past pricing, but also on the widest variety of economic indicators. The data are fed into machine learning programs that are trained to tease out even the slightest signals of misalignment in security prices. The relations uncovered are generally multi-dimensional and beyond the ability of a human to detect in real time. As in pairs trading, Renaissance avoids outright bets on the direction of price movements, which it seems to view as a fool's errand, and focuses instead on relative performance among pairs or, more generally, clusters of firms. These strategies, which are designed to profit regardless of market performance, are therefore referred to as market neutral.

Does Renaissance's incredible success validate technical analysis and thus invalidate efficient markets? That may depend in part on your standards. The firm acknowledges that each of its "bets" are right barely more than  $50\%$  of the time. Market prices are indeed hard to predict; in this sense, Renaissance's experience validates efficient markets as a very good first approximation to reality. But with very low trading costs and very frequent trades, even tiny profits can accumulate to eye-popping performance. Still, it would be a wild understatement to point out that few traders can bring to bear the analytic and trading expertise that Renaissance has developed. Nevertheless, the success of this approach has encouraged the growth of a large group of quantitative hedge funds that similarly follow market-neutral approaches.

# Sentiment Indicators

Behavioral finance devotes considerable attention to market sentiment, which may be interpreted as the general level of optimism among investors. Technical analysts have devised several measures of sentiment; we review a few of them.

Trin Statistic Trading volume is sometimes used to measure the strength of a market rise or fall. Technicians consider market advances to be a more favorable omen of continued price increases when they are associated with increased trading volume. Similarly, market reversals are considered more bearish when associated with higher volume. The trin statistic is defined as

$$
\mathrm {T r i n} = \frac {\text {V o l u m e d e c l i n i n g / N u m b e r d e c l i n i n g}}{\text {V o l u m e a v a n c i n g / N u m b e r a v a n c i n g}}
$$

Therefore, trin is the ratio of average volume in declining issues to average volume in advancing issues. Ratios above 1.0 are considered bearish because the falling stocks would then have higher average volume than the advancing stocks, indicating net selling pressure. The Wall Street Journal Online provides the data necessary to compute trin in its Markets Diary section. Using the data in Figure 12.5, trin for the NYSE on this day was:

$$
\operatorname {T r i n} = \frac {2 6 5 . 7 / 6 6 3}{1 , 1 2 7 . 8 / 2 , 7 4 4} = 1. 0 2
$$

Remember, however, that for every buyer, there must be a seller of stock. Rising volume in a rising market should not necessarily indicate a larger imbalance of buyers versus sellers. For example, a trin statistic above 1.0, which is considered bearish, could equally well be interpreted as indicating that there is more buying activity in declining issues.

Confidence Index Barron's computes a confidence index using data from the bond market. The presumption is that actions of bond traders reveal trends that will emerge soon in the stock market.

The confidence index is the ratio of the average yield on 10 top-rated corporate bonds divided by the average yield on 10 intermediate-grade corporate bonds. The ratio will always be below 1 because higher-rated bonds will offer lower promised yields to maturity. When bond traders are optimistic about the economy, however, they might require smaller default premiums on lower-rated debt. Hence, the yield spread will narrow, and the confidence index will approach 1. Therefore, higher values of the confidence index are bullish signals.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/671ed89c-9f15-4f1f-83ef-906b19e5f9bf/8e0fc6f727f9b93991e6a71749597fcb9ea803a36841f9233d2eab6330e2b4ff.jpg)

# Concept Check 12.4

Yields on lower-rated debt will rise after fears of recession have spread through the economy. This will reduce the confidence index. Should the stock market now be expected to fall, or will it already have fallen?

Short Interest Short interest is the total number of shares of stock currently sold short. The common, bearish interpretation of short interest is based on the fact that short-sellers tend to be larger, more sophisticated investors. Accordingly, increased short interest reflects negative sentiment by the "smart money," which would be a warning sign concerning the stock's prospects.

A less-common, bullish perspective is that, because all short sales must be covered (i.e., short-sellers eventually must purchase shares to return the ones they have borrowed), short interest represents latent future demand for the stocks. As short sales are covered, the demand created by the share purchase will push prices up.

Put/Call Ratio Call options give investors the right to buy a stock at a fixed "exercise" price and therefore are a way of betting on stock price increases. Put options give the right to sell a stock at a fixed price and therefore are a way of betting on stock price decreases.[30] The ratio of outstanding put options to outstanding call options is called the put/call ratio. Typically, the put/call ratio hovers around  $65\%$ . Because put options do well in falling markets while call options do well in rising markets, a rising ratio is taken as a sign of broad investor pessimism and a coming market decline.

# A Warning

The search for patterns in stock market prices is nearly irresistible, and the ability of the human eye to discern apparent patterns is remarkable. In fact, susceptibility to pattern recognition was one of the information processing errors we pointed out in Section 12.1. Unfortunately, it is possible to perceive patterns that really don't exist.

Consider Figure 12.6, which presents simulated and actual values of the Dow Jones Industrial Average during 1956 taken from a famous study by Harry Roberts.[31] In Figure 12.6, Panel B, the market appears to present a classic head-and-shoulders pattern where the middle hump (the head) is flanked by two shoulders. When the price index "pierces the right shoulder"—a technical trigger point—it is believed to be heading lower, and it is time to sell your stocks. Figure 12.6, Panel A also looks like a "typical" stock market pattern.

However, one of these panels was generated using "returns" created by a random-number generator and by construction were patternless. Can you tell which of the two graphs is constructed from the real value of the Dow and which from the simulated data?32

Figure 12.7 shows the weekly price changes behind the two panels in Figure 12.6. Here the randomness in both series—the stock price as well as the simulated sequence—is obvious.

A problem related to the tendency to perceive patterns where they don't exist is data mining. After the fact, you can always find patterns and trading rules that would have generated enormous profits. If you test enough rules, some will have worked in the past. Unfortunately, picking a theory that would have worked after the fact carries no guarantee of future success.

In evaluating trading rules, you should always ask whether the rule would have seemed reasonable before you looked at the data. If not, you might be buying into the one arbitrary rule among many that happened to have worked in that particular sample. The crucial question is whether there is reason to believe that what worked in the past should continue to work in the future.

1. Behavioral finance focuses on systematic irrationalities that characterize investor decision making. These "behavioral shortcomings" may be consistent with several efficient market anomalies.
2. Among the information processing errors uncovered in the psychology literature are heuristic decisions, overconfidence, conservatism, confirmation bias, and representativeness. Behavioral tendencies include framing, mental accounting, regret avoidance, and loss aversion.
3. Limits to arbitrage activity impede the ability of rational investors to exploit pricing errors induced by behavioral investors. For example, fundamental risk means that even if a security is mispriced, it still can be risky to attempt to exploit the mispricing. This limits the actions of arbitrageurs who take positions in mispriced securities. Other limits to arbitrage are implementation costs, model risk, and costs to short-selling. Occasional failures of the Law of One Price suggest that limits to arbitrage are sometimes severe.
4. The various limits to arbitrage mean that even if prices do not equal intrinsic value, it still may be difficult to exploit the mispricing. As a result, the failure of traders to beat the market may not be proof that markets are actually efficient, with prices equal to intrinsic value.
5. Technical analysis is the search for recurring and predictable patterns in stock prices. It is based on the premise that prices only gradually close in on intrinsic value. As fundamentals shift, astute traders can exploit the adjustment to a new equilibrium.
6. Technical analysis also uses volume data and sentiment indicators. These are broadly consistent with several behavioral models of investor activity. Moving averages, relative strength, and breadth are used in other trend-based strategies.
7. Some sentiment indicators are the trin statistic, the confidence index, short interest, and the put/ call ratio.

# PROBLEM SETS

1. Explain how some of the behavioral biases discussed in the chapter might contribute to the success of technical trading rules.
2. Why would an advocate of the efficient market hypothesis believe that even if many investors exhibit the behavioral biases discussed in the chapter, security prices might still be set efficiently?
3. What sorts of factors might limit the ability of rational investors to take advantage of any "pricing errors" that result from the actions of "behavioral investors"?
4. Even if behavioral biases do not affect equilibrium asset prices, why might it still be important for investors to be aware of them?
5. Some advocates of behavioral finance agree with efficient market advocates that indexing is the optimal investment strategy for most investors. But their reasons for this conclusion differ greatly. Compare and contrast the rationale for indexing according to both of these schools of thought.

23. Log in to Connect and link to the material for Chapter 12, where you will find five years of weekly returns for the S&P 500.

a. Set up a spreadsheet to calculate the 26-week moving average of the index. Set the value of the index at the beginning of the sample period equal to 100. The index value in each week is then updated by multiplying the previous week's level by (1 + Rate of return over previous week).
$b$ . Identify every instance in which the index crosses through its moving average from below. In how many of the weeks following a cross-through does the index increase? Decrease?
c. Identify every instance in which the index crosses through its moving average from above. In how many of the weeks following a cross-through does the index increase? Decrease?
$d$ . How well does the moving average rule perform in identifying buy or sell opportunities?

24. Log in to Connect and link to the material for Chapter 12, where you will find five years of weekly returns for the S&P 500 and Fidelity's Select Banking Fund (ticket FSRBX).

a. Set up a spreadsheet to calculate the relative strength of the banking sector compared to the broad market. (Hint: As in Problem 23, set the initial value of the sector index and the S&P 500 index equal to 100, and use each week's rate of return to update the level of each index.) b. Identify every instance in which the relative strength ratio increases by at least  $5\%$  from its value five weeks earlier. In how many of the weeks following a substantial increase in relative strength does the banking sector outperform the S&P 500? In how many of those weeks does the banking sector underperform the S&P 500?

c. Identify every instance in which the relative strength ratio decreases by at least  $5\%$  from its value five weeks earlier. In how many of the weeks following a substantial decrease in relative strength does the banking sector underperform the S&P 500? In how many of those weeks does the banking sector outperform the S&P 500?
$d$ . How well does the relative strength rule perform in identifying buy or sell opportunities?

25. One seeming violation of the Law of One Price is the pervasive discrepancy of closed-end fund prices from their net asset values. Would you expect to observe greater discrepancies on diversified or less-diversified funds? Why?

1. Don Sampson begins a meeting with his financial adviser by outlining his investment philosophy as shown below:

<table><tr><td>Statement Number</td><td>Statement</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Investments should offer strong return potential but with very limited risk. I prefer to be conservative and to minimize losses, even if I miss out on substantial growth opportunities.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>All nongovernmental investments should be in industry-leading and financially strong companies.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Income needs should be met entirely through interest income and cash dividends. All equity securities held should pay cash dividends.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Investment decisions should be based primarily on consensus forecasts of general economic conditions and company-specific growth.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>If an investment falls below the purchase price, that security should be retained until it returns to its original cost. Conversely, I prefer to take quick profits on successful investments.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>I will direct the purchase of investments, including derivative securities, periodically. These aggressive investments result from personal research and may not prove consistent with my investment policy. I have not kept records on the performance of similar past investments, but I have had some “big winners.”</td></tr></table>

Select the statement from the table above that best illustrates each of the following behavioral finance concepts. Justify your selection.

a. Mental accounting.
$b$ . Overconfidence (illusion of control).
$c$ . Disposition effect.

2. Monty Frost's tax-deferred retirement account is invested entirely in equity securities. Because the international portion of his portfolio has performed poorly in the past, he has reduced his international equity exposure to  $2\%$ . Frost's investment adviser has recommended an increased international equity exposure. Frost responds with the following comments: a. "On the basis of past poor performance, I want to sell all my remaining international equity securities once their market prices rise to equal their original cost."


b. "Most diversified international portfolios have had disappointing results over the past five years. During that time, however, the market in Country XYZ has outperformed all other markets, even our own. If I do increase my international equity exposure, I would prefer that the entire exposure consists of securities from Country XYZ."
c. "International investments are inherently more risky. Therefore, I prefer to purchase any international equity securities in my 'speculative' account, my best chance at becoming rich. I do not want them in my retirement account, which has to protect me from poverty in my old age."

Frost's adviser is familiar with behavioral finance concepts but prefers a traditional or standard finance approach (modern portfolio theory) to investments.

Indicate the behavioral finance concept that Frost most directly exhibits in each of his three comments. Explain how each of Frost's comments can be countered by using an argument from standard finance.

3. Louise and Christopher Maclin live in the U.K. and currently rent an apartment in London's metropolitan area. During an initial discussion of the Maclins' financial plans, Christopher Maclin makes the following statements to the Maclins' financial adviser, Grant Webb: a. "I have used the Internet extensively to research the outlook for the housing market over the next five years, and I believe now is the best time to buy a house."

b. "I do not want to sell any bond in my portfolio for a lower price than I paid for the bond."
c. "I will not sell any of my company stock because I know my company and I believe it has excellent prospects for the future."

For each statement  $(a) - (c)$  identify the behavioral finance concept most directly exhibited. Explain how each behavioral finance concept is affecting Maclin's investment decision making.

4. During an interview with her investment adviser, a retired investor made the following two statements: a. "I have been very pleased with the returns I've earned on Petrie stock over the past two years and I am certain that it will be a superior performer in the future."

b. "I am pleased with the returns from the Petrie stock because I have specific uses for that money. For that reason, I certainly want my retirement fund to continue owning the Petrie stock."

Identify which principle of behavioral finance is most consistent with each of the investor's two statements.

5. Claire Pierce comments on her life circumstances and investment outlook:

I must support my parents who live overseas on Pogo Island. The Pogo Island economy has grown rapidly over the past 2 years with minimal inflation, and consensus forecasts call for a continuation of these favorable trends for the foreseeable future. Economic growth has resulted from the export of a natural resource used in an exciting new technology application.

I want to invest  $10\%$  of my portfolio in Pogo Island government bonds. I plan to purchase long-term bonds because my parents are likely to live more than 10 years. Experts uniformly do not foresee a resurgence of inflation on Pogo Island, so I am certain that the total returns produced by the bonds will cover my parents' spending needs for many years to come. There should be no exchange rate risk because the bonds are denominated in local currency. I want to buy the Pogo Island bonds, but am not willing to distort my portfolio's long-term asset allocation to do so. The overall mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments should not change. Therefore, I am considering selling one of my U.S. bond funds to raise cash to buy the Pogo Island bonds. One possibility is my High Yield Bond Fund, which has declined  $5\%$  in value year to date. I am not excited about this fund's prospects; in fact, I think it is likely to decline more, but there is a small probability that it could recover very quickly. So I have decided instead to sell my Core Bond Fund that has appreciated  $5\%$  this year. I expect this investment to continue to deliver attractive returns, but there is a small chance this year's gains might disappear quickly.

Once that shift is accomplished, my investments will be in great shape. The sole exception is my Small Company Fund, which has performed poorly. I plan to sell this investment as soon as the price increases to my original cost.

Identify three behavioral finance concepts illustrated in Pierce's comments and describe each of the three concepts. Discuss how an investor practicing standard or traditional finance would challenge each of the three concepts.

# E-INVESTMENTS EXERCISES

1. Log on to finance.yahoo.com to find the monthly dividend-adjusted closing prices for the most recent 4 years for Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF). Also collect the closing level of the S&P 500 Index over the same period.

a. Calculate the 4-month moving average of both the stock and the S&P 500 over time. For each series, use Excel to plot the moving average against the actual level of the stock price or index. Examine the instances where the moving average and price series cross. Is the stock more or less likely to increase when the price crosses through the moving average? Does it matter whether the price crosses the moving average from above or below? How reliable would an investment rule based on moving averages be? Perform your analysis for both the stock price and the S&P 500.
b. Calculate and plot the relative strength of the stock compared to the S&P 500 over the sample period. Find all instances in which relative strength of the stock increases by more than 10 percentage points (e.g., an increase in the relative strength index from .93 to 1.03) and all those instances in which relative strength of the stock decreases by more than 10 percentage points. Is the stock more or less likely to outperform (underperform) the S&P 500 in the following two months when relative strength has increased (decreased)? In other words, does relative strength continue? How reliable would an investment rule based on relative strength be?

2. Yahoo! Finance provides considerable data that can be used for technical analysis. Short interest ratios are found in the Statistics table for each stock. You can also prepare charts of moving averages for any company by clicking the price chart for the company and then clicking on Indicators. You can select the moving average option and specify the length of the moving average. Prepare charts of moving averages and obtain short interest ratios for GE and Amazon (AMZN). Prepare a one-year chart of the 25- and 50-day average prices of GE, AMZN, and the S&P 500 Index.

a. Which, if either, of the companies is priced above its 25- and 50-day averages?
b. Would you consider their charts as bullish or bearish? Why?
c. What are the short interest ratios for the two companies?

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. Conservatism implies that investors will at first respond too slowly to new information, leading to trends in prices. Representativeness can lead them to extrapolate trends too far into the future and overshoot intrinsic value. Eventually, when the pricing error is corrected, we observe a reversal.
2. Out-of-favor stocks will exhibit low prices relative to various proxies for intrinsic value such as earnings. Because of regret avoidance, these stocks will need to offer a more attractive rate of return to induce investors to hold them. Thus, low P/E stocks might on average offer higher rates of return.

3. At liquidation, price will equal NAV. This puts a limit on fundamental risk. Investors need only carry the position for a few months to profit from the elimination of the discount. Moreover, as the liquidation date approaches, the discount should dissipate. This greatly limits the risk that the discount can move against the investor. At the announcement of impending liquidation, the discount should immediately disappear, or at least shrink considerably.
4. By the time the news of the recession affects bond yields, it also ought to affect stock prices. The market should fall before the confidence index signals that the time is ripe to sell.
