# Macroeconomic and Industry Analysis

THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF A stock depends on the dividend and earnings that can be expected from the firm. This is the heart of fundamental analysis—that is, the analysis of the determinants of value. Ultimately, the success of the firm determines the dividends it can pay to shareholders and the price it will command in the stock market. Because the prospects of the firm are tied to those of the broader economy, fundamental analysis must consider the business environment in which the firm operates. For some firms, macroeconomic and industry circumstances might have a greater influence on profits than the firm's relative performance within its industry. In other words, investors need to keep the big economic picture in mind.

Therefore, in analyzing a firm's prospects, it often makes sense to start with the broad economic environment, examining the state of the aggregate economy and even the international economy. From there, one considers the implications of the outside environment on the industry in which the firm operates. Finally, the firm's position within the industry is examined.


This chapter treats the broad-based aspects of fundamental analysis—macroeconomic and industry analysis. The two chapters that follow cover firm-specific analysis. We begin with a discussion of international factors relevant to firm performance and move on to an overview of the significance of the key variables usually used to summarize the state of the macroeconomy. We then discuss government macroeconomic policy. We conclude the analysis of the macroenvironment with a discussion of business cycles. Finally, we move to industry analysis, treating issues concerning the sensitivity of the firm to the business cycle, the typical life cycle of an industry, and strategic issues that affect industry performance.

# 17.1 The Global Economy

A top-down analysis of a firm's prospects must start with the global economy. The international economy might affect a firm's export prospects, the price competition it faces from competitors, or the profits it makes on investments abroad. Table 17.1 shows the importance of the global or broad regional macroeconomy to firms' prospects.

Table 17.1

Despite the importance of regional macroeconomic conditions, there can be considerable variation in economic performance across countries, even within regions. In Europe, for example, the French economy grew at a rate of  $6.1\%$  in 2021, about double the rate in Germany.

Perhaps surprisingly, stock market returns did not always align with macroeconomic performance. This reflects the impact of near-market efficiency, where stock returns are driven by performance relative to previous expectations. For example, despite the fact that its economic growth rate was near the top of the pack, even that impressive performance seems to have been below prior expectations, as the Chinese stock market rose by only  $7\%$ . And the example of Hong Kong reminds us that stock prices are forward, not backward, looking: Despite its superior GDP growth rate compared to other countries, Hong Kong was the only country in our sample with a negative stock market return. This quite likely reflected growing concern about the changing stance the Chinese government seemed to be signaling in 2021 with regard to future business independence.

These data illustrate that the national economic environment, which is a crucial determinant of industry performance, can vary widely. It is far harder for businesses to succeed in a contracting economy than in an expanding one. This observation highlights the role of a big-picture macroeconomic analysis as a fundamental part of the investment process.

In addition, political uncertainty can pose considerable economic risks. Hong Kong is a case in point. But recent years offer many other relevant examples. The sovereign debt crisis of the last decade offers a compelling illustration of the interplay between politics and economics. The prospects of bailouts for struggling countries were in large part political issues, but with enormous consequences for the world economy. The exit of the U.K. from the European Union was another political battle with big economic implications. The ebb and flow of trade tensions between the U.S. and China in recent years have had big impacts on stock market performance. And while COVID-19 is not primarily a political issue, the battles over public health responses, including mandated business shutdowns, was and continues to be highly politically charged, with big implications for economic activity. At this level of analysis, it is clear that politics and economics are intimately entwined.


Other political issues that are less sensational but still extremely important to economic growth and investment returns include issues of protectionism and trade policy, the free flow of capital, and the status of a nation's workforce.

One obvious factor that affects the international competitiveness of a country's industries is the exchange rate between that country's currency and other currencies. The exchange rate is the rate at which domestic currency can be converted into foreign currency. For example, in late 2021, it took about 110 Japanese yen to purchase 1 U.S. dollar. We would say that the exchange rate is ¥110 per dollar or, equivalently, $.0091 per yen.

As exchange rates fluctuate, the dollar value of goods priced in foreign currency similarly fluctuates. In 1980, the dollar-yen exchange rate was about $.0045 per yen. Therefore, a U.S. citizen would need more than twice as many dollars in 2021 to buy a product selling for ¥10,000 as would have been required in 1980. If the Japanese producer were to maintain a fixed yen price for its product, the price expressed in U.S. dollars would more than double. This would make Japanese products more expensive to U.S. consumers, however, and result in lost sales. Obviously, appreciation of the yen creates a problem for Japanese producers that must compete with U.S. producers.

Figure 17.1 shows the change in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar relative to the purchasing power of the currencies of several major industrial countries from 2015 through 2021. The ratio of purchasing powers is called the "real," or inflation-adjusted, exchange rate. The change in the real exchange rate measures how much more or less expensive foreign goods have become to U.S. citizens, accounting for both exchange rate fluctuations and inflation differentials across countries. A positive value in Figure 17.1 means that the dollar has gained purchasing power relative to another currency; a negative number would indicate a depreciating dollar. Therefore, we see that the U.S. dollar has appreciated in real

Goods priced in these currencies became cheaper to U.S. consumers, while goods priced in U.S. dollars became less affordable to Chinese and Japanese consumers. The opposite is true of the U.K., where the real exchange rate shifted against the dollar.

# 17.2 The Domestic Macroeconomy

The macroeconomy is the environment in which all firms operate. The importance of the macroeconomy in determining investment performance is illustrated in Figure 17.2, which compares the level of the S&P 500 stock price index to forecasts of earnings per share of the S&P 500 companies. The graph shows that stock prices tend to rise along with earnings. While the exact ratio of stock price to earnings varies with factors such as interest rates, risk, inflation rates, and other variables, the graph does illustrate that, as a general rule, the ratio has tended to be in the range of 12-25. Given "normal" price-earnings ratios, we would expect the S&P 500 index to fall within these boundaries. While the earnings-multiplier rule clearly is not perfect—note the dramatic increase in the price-earnings multiple during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s—it also seems clear that the level of the broad market and aggregate earnings do trend together. Thus, the first step in forecasting the performance of the broad market is to assess the status of the economy as a whole.

Figure 17.2 shows that 2009 was another year in which the P/E multiple was much higher than even 25 times earnings. This reflects the fact that earnings in that year, at the height of the deep recession, were dramatically below trend projections. Market prices reflect earnings prospects well into the future and therefore fell by less than earnings in that particular year. As we will see in Chapter 18, P/E ratios are best interpreted relative to future, not past, earnings: Stock prices are forward-looking measures of firm value.

The ability to forecast the macroeconomy can translate into spectacular investment performance. But it is not enough to forecast the macroeconomy well. You must forecast it better than your competitors to earn abnormal profits. In this section, we will review some of the key economic statistics used to describe the state of the macroeconomy.

# Key Economic Indicators

Gross Domestic Product Gross domestic product, or GDP, is the measure of the economy's total production of goods and services. Rapidly growing GDP indicates an expanding economy with ample opportunity for a firm to increase sales. Another popular measure of the economy's output is industrial production. This statistic provides a measure of economic activity more narrowly focused on the manufacturing side of the economy.

**Employment** The unemployment rate is the percentage of the total labor force (i.e., those who are either working or actively seeking employment) yet to find work. The unemployment rate measures the extent to which the economy is operating at full capacity. The unemployment rate is a factor related to workers only, but further insight into the strength of the economy can be gleaned by examining the use of other factors of production. For example, analysts look at the factory capacity utilization rate, which is the ratio of actual output from factories to potential output.

Inflation The rate at which the general level of prices rises is called inflation. High rates of inflation often are associated with "overheated" economies, that is, economies where the demand for goods and services is outstripping productive capacity, which leads to upward pressure on prices. Most governments walk a fine line in their economic policies. They hope to stimulate their economies enough to maintain nearly full employment, but not so much as to bring on inflationary pressures. The perceived trade-off between inflation and unemployment is at the heart of many macroeconomic policy disputes. There is considerable room for disagreement as to the relative costs of inflation versus unemployment as well as the economy's relative vulnerability to these pressures at any particular time.

Interest Rates High interest rates reduce the present value of future cash flows, thereby reducing the attractiveness of investment opportunities. For this reason, real interest rates are key determinants of business investment expenditures. Demand for housing and high-priced consumer durables such as automobiles, which are commonly financed, also is highly sensitive to interest rates that affect interest payments. (In Chapter 5, Section 5.1, we examined the determinants of interest rates.)

Budget Deficit The budget deficit of the federal government is the difference between government spending and revenues. Any budgetary shortfall must be offset by government borrowing. Large amounts of government borrowing can force up interest rates by increasing the total demand for credit in the economy. Economists generally believe excessive government borrowing will "crowd out" private borrowing by forcing up interest rates and choking off business investment.

Sentiment Consumers' and producers' optimism or pessimism concerning the economy is an important determinant of economic performance. If consumers have confidence in their future income levels, for example, they will be more willing to spend on big-ticket items. Similarly, businesses will increase production and inventory levels if they anticipate higher demand for their products. In this way, beliefs influence how much consumption and investment will be pursued and affect the aggregate demand for goods and services.

# Concept Check 17.1

Consider an economy where the dominant industry is automobile production for both domestic consumption as well as export. Now suppose auto sales fall in response to an increase in the length of time people use their cars before replacing them. Describe the probable effects of this change on (a) GDP, (b) unemployment, (c) the government budget deficit, and (d) interest rates.

# 17.3 Demand and Supply Shocks

A useful way to organize your analysis of the factors that might influence the macroeconomy is to classify any impact as a supply or demand shock. A demand shock is an event that affects the demand for goods and services. Examples of positive demand shocks are reductions in tax rates, increases in the money supply, increases in government spending, or increases in foreign export demand. A supply shock is an event that influences production capacity and costs. Examples of supply shocks are changes in the price of energy; freezes, floods, or droughts that might destroy large quantities of agricultural crops; changes in the educational level of an economy's workforce; or changes in the wage rates at which the labor force is willing to work.

The fallout of COVID-19 presented good examples of adverse supply shocks. Disrupted supply chains made it both difficult and more expensive to find either consumer or producer goods, leading to price increases across the economy. As just one example, consider the dramatic reduction in automobile production (and dramatic price increases) in 2021 resulting from the shortage of component computer chips. COVID-19 also led to a reduction in the national workforce, as some workers chose to retire and others needed to leave jobs to attend to children who were no longer able to physically attend school. Labor force issues in the United States were exacerbated by even more severe problems in many countries where vaccines were less available and infection rates were higher.

Demand shocks are usually characterized by aggregate output moving in the same direction as interest rates and inflation. For example, a big increase in government spending will tend to stimulate the economy and increase GDP. It also might increase interest rates by increasing the demand for borrowed funds by both the government as well as businesses that might desire to borrow to finance new ventures. Finally, it could increase the inflation rate if the demand for goods and services is raised to a level at or beyond the total productive capacity of the economy.

Supply shocks are usually characterized by aggregate output moving in the opposite direction of inflation and interest rates. For example, a big increase in the price of energy is inflationary because costs of production rise and lead to increases in prices of finished goods. The increase in inflation rates over the near term can lead to higher nominal interest rates. Against this background, aggregate output will be falling. With raw materials more expensive, the productive capacity of the economy is reduced, as is the ability of individuals to purchase goods at now-higher prices. GDP, therefore, tends to fall.

COVID-19 and the government response to it generated demand as well as supply shocks. The nearby box explores some of the economic fallout from their interactions.

How can we relate this framework to investment analysis? You want to identify the industries that will be most helped or hurt in a particular macroeconomic scenario. For example, if you forecast a tightening of the money supply, you might want to avoid industries such as automobile producers that might be hurt by the likely increase in interest

Following a full decade of moderate inflation averaging less than  $2\%$  per year, the U.S. inflation rate in mid-2022 jumped to  $8.6\%$ . What caused such a dramatic increase? There were several suspects.

On the demand side, analysts point to expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. Fiscal policy in response to COVID-19 included substantial federal enhancements to unemployment benefits as well as direct income transfers from the government to individuals. Monetary policy similarly was highly expansionary, with the Fed pushing short-term interest rates close to zero. On the supply side, COVID-19 elicited engendered supply-side interruptions including worker departures from the labor market, shortages in key commodities such as computer chips, massive disruptions to the supply chain (most visibly, ocean transport of container ships), and increases in energy prices.

Any of these shocks would, by themselves, be inflationary. But the unusual dynamic behind the inflation surge was the interaction between these shocks. Normally, an increase in demand would elicit two responses from suppliers: primarily higher output and perhaps higher prices. But with severely constricted supply, the entire demand shock was absorbed by an increase in prices. Thus, supply disruptions exacerbated the impact of demand shocks. For example, auto producers who could not obtain chips to expand production to meet increased demand instead raised prices dramatically as consumers competed to obtain new cars. Similarly, as many workers withdrew from the labor market and firms competed to hire the remaining ones, wages rose, leading to higher costs in service industries.


This leaves the government with few of its conventional policy tools. For the most part, policy makers initially seemed resigned to wait for the supply-side distortions to resolve on their own as the supply chain could be rebuilt and workers (with less unemployment support) would reenter the job market. Higher prices should encourage investments by manufacturers to increase capacity. But the transition to this happier equilibrium has been, to say the least, rocky.

rates. We caution you again that these forecasts are no easy task. Macroeconomic predictions are notoriously unreliable. And again, you must be aware that in all likelihood your forecast will be made using only publicly available information. Any investment advantage you have will be a result only of better analysis—not better information.

# 17.4 Federal Government Policy

As the previous section would suggest, the government has two broad classes of macro-economic tools—those that affect the demand for goods and services and those that affect the supply. In the decades following the second World War, demand-side policy was of primary interest. The focus was on government spending, taxes, and monetary policy. Since the 1980s, however, increasing attention has been focused on supply-side economics. Broadly interpreted, supply-side concerns have to do with enhancing the productive capacity of the economy, rather than increasing the demand for goods and services. In practice, supply-side economists have focused on the appropriateness of the incentives to work, innovate, and take risks that result from our system of taxation. However, issues such as national policies on education, infrastructure (such as communication, power, and transportation systems), and research and development also are properly regarded as part of supply-side macroeconomic policy. The massive 1.2 trillion infrastructure bill of 2021 was focused on exactly these issues.

# Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy refers to the government's spending and tax actions and is part of "demand-side management." Fiscal policy is probably the most direct way to either stimulate or slow the economy. Decreases in government spending directly reduce the demand for goods and services. Similarly, increases in tax rates immediately siphon income from consumers and result in fairly rapid decreases in consumption.

Ironically, although fiscal policy has the most immediate impact on the economy, the formulation and implementation of such policy is usually painfully slow and involved.

This is because fiscal policy requires enormous amounts of compromise between the executive and legislative branches. Tax and spending policy must be initiated and voted on by Congress, which requires considerable political negotiations, and any legislation passed must be signed by the president, requiring more negotiation. Thus, although the impact of fiscal policy is relatively immediate, its formulation is so cumbersome that fiscal policy cannot in practice be used to fine-tune the economy.

Moreover, much of government spending, such as that for Medicare or Social Security, is nondiscretionary, meaning that it is determined by formula rather than policy and cannot be changed in response to economic conditions. This results in even greater limitations on fiscal policy as a tool of macroeconomic management.

A common way to summarize the net impact of government fiscal policy is to look at the government's budget deficit or surplus, which is simply the difference between revenues and expenditures. A deficit means the government is spending more than it is taking in by way of taxes. The net effect is to increase the demand for goods (via spending) by more than it reduces the demand for goods (via taxes), thereby stimulating the economy.

# Monetary Policy

Monetary policy refers to the manipulation of the money supply to affect the macroeconomy and is the other main leg of demand-side policy. Monetary policy works largely through its impact on interest rates. Increases in the money supply lower short-term interest rates, ultimately encouraging investment and consumption demand. Over longer periods, however, most economists believe a higher money supply leads only to a higher price level and does not have a permanent effect on economic activity. Thus, the monetary authorities face a difficult balancing act. Expansionary monetary policy probably will lower interest rates and thereby stimulate investment and some consumption demand in the short run, but these circumstances ultimately will lead only to higher prices. Of course, the time frame regarding "ultimately" is a subject of contentious debate. If it is long enough, then monetary policy can be a valuable tool for macroeconomic management. If it is too short, then expansionary monetary policy is more likely to increase prices than real GDP. This difficult-to-assess trade-off is at least implicitly central to all debate about proper policy.

Fiscal policy is cumbersome to implement but has a fairly direct impact on the economy, whereas monetary policy is easily formulated and implemented but has a less immediate impact. Monetary policy is determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Board members are appointed by the president for 14-year terms and are reasonably insulated from political pressure. The board is small enough, and often sufficiently dominated by its chairperson, that policy can be formulated and modulated relatively easily.

Implementation of monetary policy also is quite direct. The most widely used tool is the open market operation, in which the Fed buys or sells bonds for its own account. When the Fed buys securities, it simply "writes a check," thereby increasing the money supply. (Unlike us, the Fed can pay for the securities without drawing down funds at a bank account.) Conversely, when the Fed sells a security, the money paid for it leaves the money supply. Open market operations occur daily, allowing the Fed to fine-tune its monetary policy.

A variant on open market operations is so-called quantitative easing, which was first undertaken widely during the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and then again in response to the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, rather than buying primarily short-term government securities, the Fed buys a wider range of assets, for example, corporate and municipal bonds or even stocks. Central banks turn to quantitative easing when they believe conventional open market operations have reached the limit of their effectiveness. For example, even if short-term interest rates are already near zero, quantitative easing may still stimulate the economy by increasing the money supply and by raising the prices (and lowering the yields) of the riskier assets in the purchase program.


Other tools at the Fed's disposal are the discount rate, which is the interest rate it charges banks on short-term loans, and the reserve requirement, which is the fraction of deposits that banks must hold as cash on hand or as deposits with the Fed. Reductions in the discount rate signal a more expansionary monetary policy. Lowering reserve requirements allows banks to make more loans with each dollar of deposits and stimulates the economy by increasing the effective money supply.

While the discount rate is under the direct control of the Fed, it is changed relatively infrequently. The federal funds rate is by far the better guide to Federal Reserve policy. The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks make short-term, usually overnight, loans to each other. These loans occur because some banks need to borrow funds to meet reserve requirements, while other banks have excess funds. Unlike the discount rate, the fed funds rate is a market rate, meaning that it is determined by supply and demand rather than being set administratively. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve Board targets the fed funds rate, expanding or contracting the money supply through open market operations as it nudges the fed funds rate to its targeted value. This is the benchmark short-term U.S. interest rate, and as such it has considerable influence on other interest rates in the United States and the rest of the world.

Monetary policy affects the economy in a more roundabout way than fiscal policy. Whereas fiscal policy directly stimulates or dampens the economy, monetary policy works largely through its impact on interest rates. Increases in the money supply lower interest rates, which stimulates investment demand. As the quantity of money in the economy increases, investors will find that their portfolios of assets include too much money. They will rebalance their portfolios by buying securities such as bonds, forcing bond prices up and interest rates down. In the longer run, individuals may increase their holdings of stocks as well and ultimately buy real assets, which stimulates consumption demand directly. The ultimate effect of monetary policy on investment and consumption demand, however, is less immediate than that of fiscal policy.

# Concept Check 17.2

Suppose the government wants to stimulate the economy without increasing interest rates. What combination of fiscal and monetary policy might accomplish this goal?

# Supply-Side Policies

Fiscal policy and monetary policy are demand-oriented tools that affect the economy by stimulating the total demand for goods and services. The implicit belief is that the economy will not by itself arrive at a full employment equilibrium and that macroeconomic policy can push the economy toward this goal. In contrast, supply-side policies treat the issue of the productive capacity of the economy. The goal is to create an environment in which workers and owners of capital have the maximum incentive and ability to produce and develop goods.

Supply-side economists also pay considerable attention to tax policy. Whereas demand-siders look at the effect of taxes on consumption demand, supply-siders focus on incentives and marginal tax rates. They argue that lowering tax rates will elicit more investment and improve incentives to work, thereby enhancing economic growth. Some go so far as to claim that reductions in tax rates can lead to increases in tax revenues because the lower tax rates will cause the economy and the revenue tax base to grow by more than the tax rate is reduced.

# Concept Check 17.3

Large tax cuts in 2018 were followed by relatively rapid growth in GDP. How would demand-side and supply-side economists differ in their interpretations of this phenomenon?

# 17.5 Business Cycles

We've looked at the tools the government uses to fine-tune the economy, attempting to maintain low unemployment and low inflation. Despite these efforts, economies repeatedly seem to pass through good and bad times. One determinant of the broad asset allocation decision of many analysts is a forecast of whether the macroeconomy is improving or deteriorating. A forecast that differs from the market consensus can have a major impact on investment strategy.

# The Business Cycle

The economy recurrently experiences periods of expansion and contraction, although the length and depth of those cycles can be irregular. This recurring pattern of recession and recovery is called the business cycle. Transition points across cycles are called peaks and troughs. A peak is the transition from the end of an expansion to the start of a contraction. A trough occurs at the bottom of a recession just as the economy enters a recovery.

As the economy passes through different stages of the business cycle, the relative performance of different industry groups might be expected to vary. For example, at a trough, as the economy begins to recover from a recession, one would expect cyclical industries, those with above-average sensitivity to the state of the economy, to perform best. Examples of cyclical industries are producers of durable goods such as automobiles. Because purchases of these goods can be deferred during a recession, sales are particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. Other cyclical industries are producers of capital goods, that is, goods used by other firms to produce their own products. When demand is slack, few companies will be expanding and purchasing capital goods. Therefore, the capital goods industry bears the brunt of a slowdown but does well in an expansion.

In contrast to cyclical firms, defensive industries have comparatively less sensitivity to the business cycle. These are industries that produce goods for which sales and profits are least sensitive to the state of the economy. Defensive industries include food producers and processors, pharmaceutical firms, and public utilities. These industries will outperform others when the economy enters a recession.

The cyclical/defensive classification corresponds well to the notion of systematic or market risk introduced in our discussion of portfolio theory. When perceptions about the health of the economy become more optimistic, for example, the prices of most stocks will increase as forecasts of profitability rise. Because cyclical firms are most sensitive to such developments, their stock prices will rise the most. These firms will tend to have high-beta stocks. Conversely, defensive firms will have low betas and performance that is less responsive to overall market conditions.

If your assessments of the state of the business cycle were reliably more accurate than those of other investors, you would simply choose cyclical industries when you are relatively more optimistic about the economy and defensive firms when you are relatively more pessimistic. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to determine when the economy is passing through a peak or a trough. If it were, choosing between cyclical and defensive industries would be easy. As we know from our discussion of efficient markets, however, attractive investment choices will rarely be obvious. It usually is not apparent that a recession or expansion has started or ended until several months after the fact. With hindsight, the transitions from expansion to recession and back might seem clear, but it is often quite difficult to tell in real time whether the economy is heating up or slowing down.

# Economic Indicators

Given the cyclical nature of the business cycle, it is not surprising that to some extent the cycle can be predicted. A set of cyclical indicators computed by the Conference Board helps forecast, measure, and interpret short-term fluctuations in economic activity. Leading economic indicators are those economic series that tend to rise or fall in advance of the rest of the economy. Coincident and lagging indicators, as their names suggest, move in tandem with or somewhat after the broad economy, respectively.

Ten series are grouped into a widely followed composite index of leading economic indicators. Similarly, four coincident and seven lagging indicators form separate indexes. The composition of these indexes appears in Table 17.2.

Figure 17.3 graphs the leading, lagging, and coincident indicators over the last several decades. The shaded areas in the figure represent periods of recession. The dates at the top of the chart (with format Year: Month) correspond to peaks and troughs (i.e., the turning

The stock market price index is a leading indicator. This is what we would expect, as stock prices are forward-looking predictors of future profitability. Unfortunately, this makes the series of leading indicators much less useful for investment policy—by the time the series predicts an upturn, the market has already made its move. Although the business cycle may be somewhat predictable, the stock market may not be. This is just one more manifestation of the efficient markets hypothesis.

Other leading indicators focus directly on decisions made today that will affect production in the near future. For example, manufacturers' new orders for goods, contracts, and orders for plant and equipment and housing starts all signal a coming expansion in the economy.

A wide range of economic indicators is released to the public on a regular "economic calendar." Table 17.3 is an economic calendar listing the public announcement dates and sources for about 20 statistics of interest. These announcements are available at many sites on the Web. Figure 17.4 is a brief excerpt from the Economic Calendar page at MarketWatch. Notice that recent forecasts of each variable are provided along with the actual value of each statistic. This is useful because, in an efficient market, security prices already will reflect market expectations. The new information in the announcement will determine the market response.

# 17.6 Industry Analysis

Industry analysis is important for the same reason that macroeconomic analysis is. Just as it is difficult for an industry to perform well when the macroeconomy is ailing, it is unusual for a firm in a troubled industry to perform well. Similarly, just as we have seen that economic performance can vary widely across countries, performance also can vary widely across industries. Figure 17.5 illustrates the dispersion of industry performance. It shows return on equity based on 2020 profitability for several major industry groups. ROE in this COVID-19-affected year ranged from  $-47.2\%$  in the air-transport industry (with severe travel disruptions) to  $29\%$  for soft drinks (in the workfrom-home economy).

Given the wide variation in profitability, it is not surprising that industry groups exhibit considerable dispersion in their stock market performance. Figure 17.6 presents the 2020 stock market performance of several industry groups. The spread in performance is remarkable, ranging from a  $42\%$  gain in the retail industry to a  $34\%$  loss in the coal industry. This range of performance was very much available to virtually all investors. Industry-focused exchange traded funds such as iShares trade like stocks and thus allow even small investors to take a position in each traded industry. Alternatively, one can invest in mutual funds with an industry focus. For example, Fidelity offers over 40 sector funds, each with a particular industry focus.

# Defining an Industry

Although the concept of an "industry" seems clear-cut, deciding where to draw the line between one industry and another can be difficult in practice. Consider, for example, the wide dispersion of firms included in the application software industry. As Figure 17.7 demonstrates, ROA ranged from only  $3.0\%$  for Symantec to  $14.6\%$  for Microsoft. Despite their similarities, these firms clearly operated in different business niches.

A useful way to define industry groups in practice is given by the North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS codes. These are codes assigned to group firms in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada [trade] Agreement for statistical analysis. The first two digits of the NAICS codes denote very broad industry classifications. For example, Table 17.4 shows that the codes for all construction firms start with 23. The next digits define the industry grouping more narrowly. For example, codes starting with 236 denote building construction, 2361 denotes residential construction, and 236115 denotes single-family construction. The first five digits of the NAICS codes are common across all three USMCA countries. The sixth digit is country-specific and allows for a finer partition of industries. Firms with the same four-digit NAICS codes are commonly taken to be in the same industry.

Table 17.4
Examples of NAICS industry codes

<table><tr><td>NAICS Code</td><td>NAICS Title</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Construction</td></tr><tr><td>236</td><td>Construction of Buildings</td></tr><tr><td>2361</td><td>Residential Building Construction</td></tr><tr><td>23611</td><td>Residential Building Construction</td></tr><tr><td>236115</td><td>New Single-Family Housing Construction</td></tr><tr><td>236116</td><td>New Multifamily Housing Construction</td></tr><tr><td>236118</td><td>Residential Remodelers</td></tr><tr><td>2362</td><td>Nonresidential Building Construction</td></tr><tr><td>23621</td><td>Industrial Building Construction</td></tr><tr><td>23622</td><td>Commercial and Institutional Building Construction</td></tr></table>

2These codes are used for firms operating inside the USMCA (U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement). The USMCA is the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. NAICS codes replaced the Standard Industry Classification or SIC codes previously used in the U.S.

NAICS industry classifications are not perfect. For example, both Kohl's and Neiman Marcus might be classified as "Department Stores." Yet the former is a high-volume "value" store, whereas the latter is a high-margin elite retailer. Are they really in the same industry? Still, these classifications are a tremendous aid in conducting industry analysis because they provide a means of focusing on very broad or fairly narrowly defined groups of firms.

Several other industry classifications are provided by other analysts; for example, Standard & Poor's reports on the performance of about 100 industry groups. S&P computes stock price indexes for each group, which is useful in assessing past investment performance. The Value Line Investment Survey reports on the conditions and prospects of about 1,700 firms, grouped into about 90 industries. Value Line's analysts prepare forecasts of the performance of industry groups as well as of each firm.

# Sensitivity to the Business Cycle

Once the analyst forecasts the state of the macroeconomy, it is necessary to determine the implication of that forecast for specific industries. Not all industries are equally sensitive to the business cycle.

To illustrate, Figure 17.8 plots changes in retail sales (year over year) in two industries: jewelry and grocery stores. Clearly, sales of jewelry, which is a luxury good, fluctuate more widely than those of groceries. Jewelry sales jumped in 1999 at the height of the dot-com boom but fell steeply in the recessions of 2001 and 2008-2009. In contrast, sales growth in the grocery industry is relatively stable, with no years in which sales meaningfully decline. These patterns reflect the fact that jewelry is a discretionary good, whereas most grocery products are staples for which demand will not fall significantly even in hard times.

Three factors determine the sensitivity of a firm's earnings to the business cycle. First is the sensitivity of sales. Necessities show little sensitivity to business conditions. Examples of industries in this group are food, drugs, and medical services. Other industries with low sensitivity are those for which income is not a crucial determinant of demand. Tobacco products are an example of this type of industry. In contrast, firms in industries such as machine tools, steel, autos, and transportation are highly sensitive to the state of the economy.

Figure 17.8 Industry cyclicality: Growth of sales, year over year, in two industries; sales of jewelry show much greater variation than sales of groceries.

The second factor determining business cycle sensitivity is operating leverage, which refers to the division between fixed and variable costs. (Fixed costs are those the firm incurs regardless of its production levels. Variable costs are those that rise or fall as the firm produces more or less product.) Profits of firms with greater amounts of variable as opposed to fixed costs will be less sensitive to business conditions. This is because in economic downturns, these firms can reduce costs as output falls in response to falling sales. Profits for firms with high fixed costs will swing more widely with sales because costs do not move to offset revenue variability. These firms are said to have high operating leverage because small swings in business conditions can have large impacts on profitability.

# Example 17.1 Operating Leverage

Consider two firms operating in the same industry with identical revenues in all phases of the business cycle: recession, normal, and expansion. Firm A has short-term leases on most of its equipment and can reduce its lease expenditures when production slackens. It has fixed costs of  \$5 million and variable costs of\$ 1 per unit of output. Firm B has long-term leases on most of its equipment and must make lease payments regardless of economic conditions. Its fixed costs are higher, \$8 million, but its variable costs are only $.50 per unit. Table 17.5 shows that Firm A will do better in recessions than Firm B, but not as well in expansions. A's costs move in conjunction with its revenues to help performance in downturns and impede performance in upturns.

We can quantify operating leverage by measuring how sensitive profits are to changes in sales. The degree of operating leverage (DOL) is defined as

$$
\mathrm {D O L} = \frac {\text {P e r c e n t a g e c h a n g e i n p r o f i t s}}{\text {P e r c e n t a g e c h a n g e i n s a l s e s}}
$$

DOL greater than 1 indicates some operating leverage. For example, if  $\mathrm{DOL} = 2$ , then for every  $1\%$  change in sales, profits will change by  $2\%$  in the same direction, either up or down.

We have seen that the degree of operating leverage increases with a firm's exposure to fixed costs. In fact, one can show that DOL depends on fixed costs in the following manner:

$$
\mathrm {D O L} = 1 + \frac {\text {F i x e d c o s t s}}{\text {P r o f i t s}}
$$

Table 17.5

# Example 17.2 Degree of Operating Leverage

Return to the two firms illustrated in Table 17.5 and compare profits and sales in the normal scenario for the economy with those in a recession. Profits of Firm A fall by  $100\%$  (from  $\$ 1$  million to zero) when sales fall by  $16.7\%$  (from  $\$ 6$  million to  $\$ 5$  million):

$$
\mathrm {DOL} (\text {Firm A}) = \frac {\text {Percentage change in profits}}{\text {Percentage change in sales}} = \frac {- 100 \%}{- 16.7 \%} = 6
$$

We can confirm the relationship between DOL and fixed costs as follows:

$$
\mathrm {D O L} (\text {F i r m A}) = 1 + \frac {\text {F i x e d c o s t s}}{\text {P r o f i t s}} = 1 + \frac {\mathbb {S} 5 \text {m i l l i o n}}{\mathbb {S} 1 \text {m i l l i o n}} = 6
$$

Firm B has higher fixed costs, and its operating leverage is higher. Again, compare data for a normal scenario to a recession. Profits for Firm B fall by  $150\%$ , from  $\$ 1$  million to  $-\$ .5$  million. Operating leverage for Firm B is therefore

$$
\mathrm {DOL} (\text {Firm B}) = \frac {\text {Percentage change in profits}}{\text {Percentage change in sales}} = \frac {- 150 \%}{- 16.7 \%} = 9
$$ which reflects its higher level of fixed costs:


$$
\mathrm {D O L} (\text {F i r m B}) = 1 + \frac {\text {F i x e d c o s t s}}{\text {P r o f i t s}} = 1 + \frac {\mathbb {S} 8 \text {m i l l i o n}}{\mathbb {S} 1 \text {m i l l i o n}} = 9
$$

The third factor influencing business cycle sensitivity is financial leverage, which is the use of borrowing. Interest payments on debt must be paid regardless of sales. They are fixed costs that also increase the sensitivity of profits to business conditions. (We will have more to say about financial leverage in Chapter 19.)

Investors should not always prefer industries with lower sensitivity to the business cycle. Firms in sensitive industries will have high-beta stocks and are riskier. But while they swing lower in downturns, they also swing higher in upturns. As always, the key issue is whether the expected return on the investment is fair compensation for the risks borne.

# Sector Rotation

One way that many analysts think about the relationship between industry analysis and the business cycle is the notion of sector rotation. The idea is to shift the portfolio more heavily into industry or sector groups that are expected to outperform others based on one's assessment of the state of the business cycle.

Figure 17.9 is a stylized depiction of the business cycle. Near the peak of the business cycle, the economy might be overheated, with high inflation and interest rates and price pressures on basic commodities. This might be a good time to invest in firms engaged in natural resource extraction and processing such as minerals or petroleum.

Following a peak, when the economy enters a contraction or recession, one would expect defensive industries that are less sensitive to economic conditions, for example, pharmaceuticals, food, and other necessities, to be the best performers. At the height of the contraction, financial firms will be hurt by shrinking loan volume and higher default rates. Toward the end of the recession, however, contractions induce lower inflation and interest rates, which favor financial firms.

At the trough of a recession, the economy is poised for recovery and subsequent expansion. Firms might thus be spending on purchases of new equipment to meet anticipated increases in demand. This, then, would be a good time to invest in capital goods industries, such as equipment, transportation, or construction.

Finally, in an expansion, the economy is growing rapidly. Cyclical industries such as consumer durables and luxury items will be most profitable in this stage of the cycle. Banks might also do well in expansions because loan volume will be high and default exposure low when the economy is growing rapidly.


Figure 17.10 illustrates sector rotation. When investors are relatively pessimistic about the economy, they will shift into noncyclical industries such as consumer staples or health care. When anticipating an expansion, they will prefer more cyclical industries such as materials and technology.

Don't forget that sector rotation, like any other form of market timing, will be successful only if one anticipates the next stage of the business cycle better than other investors. The business cycle depicted in Figure 17.9 is highly stylized. In real life, it is never as clear how long each phase of the cycle will last, nor how extreme it will be. These forecasts are where analysts need to earn their keep.

# Industry Life Cycles

Examine the software application industry and you will find many firms with high rates of investment, high rates of return on investment, and low dividend payout rates. Do the same for the public utility industry and you will find lower rates of return, lower investment rates, and higher dividend payout rates. Why should this be?

Software application firms have many opportunities for highly profitable investment of resources. New products are protected by patents, and profit margins are high. With such lucrative opportunities, firms find it advantageous to reinvest profits in the firm. The companies generally grow rapidly.

Eventually, however, growth must slow. The high profit rates will induce new firms to enter the industry. Increasing competition will hold down prices and profit margins. New technologies become proven and more predictable, risk levels fall, and entry becomes even easier. As internal investment opportunities become less attractive, a lower fraction of profits is reinvested in the firm. Cash dividends increase.

Ultimately, in a mature industry, we observe "cash cows," firms with stable dividends and cash flows and little risk. Growth rates might be similar to that of the overall economy. Industries in early stages of their life cycles offer high-risk/high-potential-return investments. Mature industries offer lower-risk, lower-return profiles.

This analysis suggests that a typical industry life cycle might be described by four stages: a start-up stage, characterized by extremely rapid growth; a consolidation stage, characterized by growth that is less rapid but still faster than that of the general economy; a maturity stage, characterized by growth no faster than the general economy; and a stage of relative decline, in which the industry grows less rapidly than the rest of the economy, or actually shrinks. This industry life cycle is illustrated in Figure 17.11. Let us turn to an elaboration of each of these stages.

## Start-Up Stage

The early stages of an industry are often characterized by a new technology or product such as desktop personal computers in the 1980s, cell phones in the 1990s, or touchscreen smartphones introduced in 2007. At this stage, it is difficult to predict which firms will emerge as industry leaders. Some firms will turn out to be wildly successful, and others will fail altogether. Therefore, there is considerable risk in selecting one particular firm within the industry. At the moment, for example, there is a battle ranging for dominance in 5G hardware. While Huawei had an early lead, cybersecurity concerns in the West led to restrictions against it. Now Samsung is viewed as having an opening to become a big player in the market, alongside the other early entrants, Nokia and Ericsson. It is difficult to predict which firm will ultimately win this battle.


At the industry level, however, it is clear that sales and earnings will grow at an extremely rapid rate because the new product has not yet saturated its market. For example, in 2020, relatively few households had 5G-enabled smartphones. The potential market for the product therefore was huge. In contrast, consider the market for a mature product like refrigerators. Almost all households in the United States already have refrigerators, so the market for this good is primarily composed of households replacing old ones, which obviously limits the potential growth rate.

Figure 17.11 The industry life cycle

## Consolidation Stage

After a product becomes established, industry leaders begin to emerge. The survivors from the start-up stage are more stable, and market share is easier to predict. Therefore, the performance of the surviving firms will more closely track the performance of the overall industry. The industry still grows faster than the rest of the economy as the product penetrates the marketplace and becomes more commonly used.

## Maturity Stage

At this point, the product has reached its full potential for use by consumers. Further growth might merely track growth in the general economy. The product has become far more standardized, and producers are forced to compete to a greater extent on the basis of price. This leads to narrower profit margins and further pressure on profits. Firms at this stage sometimes are characterized as cash cows, providing reasonably stable cash flow but offering little opportunity for profitable expansion. The cash flow is best "milked from" rather than reinvested in the company.

We pointed to desktop PCs as a start-up industry in the 1980s. By the mid-1990s it was a mature industry, with high market penetration, considerable price competition, low profit margins, and slowing sales. By the 1990s, desktops were progressively giving way to laptops, which were in their own start-up stage. Within a dozen years, laptops had in turn entered a maturity stage, with standardization, low profit margins, and new competition from tablets and large-screen smartphones.

## Relative Decline

In this stage, the industry might grow at less than the rate of the overall economy, or it might even shrink. This could be due to obsolescence of the product, competition from new low-cost suppliers, or competition from new products; consider, for example, the steady displacement of desktops, first by laptops and now by tablets.

At which stage in the life cycle are investments in an industry most attractive? Conventional wisdom is that investors should seek firms in high-growth industries. This recipe for success is simplistic, however. If the security prices already reflect the likelihood for high growth, then it is too late to make money from that knowledge. Moreover, high growth and fat profits encourage competition from other producers. The exploitation of profit opportunities brings about new sources of supply that eventually reduce prices, profits, investment returns, and finally growth. This is the dynamic behind the progression from one stage of the industry life cycle to another. The famous portfolio manager Peter Lynch makes this point in One Up on Wall Street:

Many people prefer to invest in a high-growth industry, where there's a lot of sound and fury. Not me. I prefer to invest in a low-growth industry. . . . In a low-growth industry, especially one that's boring and upsets people [such as funeral homes or the oil-drum retrieval business], there's no problem with competition. You don't have to protect your flanks from potential rivals . . . and this gives you the leeway to continue to grow.

In fact, Lynch uses an industry classification system in a very similar spirit to the life-cycle approach we have described. He places firms in the following six groups:

Slow Growers Large and aging companies that will grow only slightly faster than the broad economy. These firms have matured from their earlier fast-growth phase. They usually have steady cash flow and pay a generous dividend, indicating that the firm is generating more cash than can be profitably reinvested in the firm.

Stalwarts Large, well-known firms like Coca-Cola or Hershey's. They grow faster than the slow growers but are not in the very rapid growth start-up stage. They also tend to be in noncyclical industries that are relatively unaffected by recessions.

Fast Growers Small and aggressive new firms with annual growth rates in the neighborhood of $20 - 25\%$. Company growth can be due to broad industry growth or to an increase in market share in a more mature industry.

Cyclicals These are firms with sales and profits that regularly expand and contract along with the business cycle. Examples are auto companies, steel companies, or the construction industry.

Turnarounds These are firms that are in bankruptcy or soon might be. If they can recover from what might appear to be imminent disaster, they can offer tremendous investment returns. A good example of this type of firm would be Chrysler in 1982, when it required a government guarantee on its debt to avoid bankruptcy. The stock price rose 15-fold in the next five years.

Asset Plays These are firms that have valuable assets not currently reflected in the stock price. For example, a company may own or be located on valuable real estate that is worth as much as or more than the company's business enterprises. Sometimes the hidden asset can be tax-loss carryforwards. Other times the assets may be intangible. For example, a cable company might have a valuable list of cable subscribers. These assets do not immediately generate cash flow and so may be more easily overlooked by other analysts attempting to value the firm.

# Industry Structure and Performance

The maturation of an industry involves regular changes in the firm's competitive environment. As a final topic, we examine the relationship among industry structure, competitive strategy, and profitability. Michael Porter has highlighted these five determinants of competition: threat of entry from new competitors, rivalry between existing competitors, price pressure from substitute products, bargaining power of buyers, and bargaining power of suppliers.[5]

Threat of Entry New entrants to an industry put pressure on price and profits. Even if a firm has not yet entered an industry, the potential for it to do so places pressure on prices because high prices and profit margins will encourage entry by new competitors. Therefore, barriers to entry can be a key determinant of industry profitability. Barriers can take many forms. For example, existing firms may already have secure distribution channels for their products based on long-standing relationships with customers or suppliers that would be costly for a new entrant to duplicate. Brand loyalty also makes it difficult for new entrants to penetrate a market and gives firms more pricing discretion. Proprietary knowledge or patent protection also may give firms advantages in serving a market. Finally, an existing firm's experience in a market may give it cost advantages due to the learning that takes place over time.

Rivalry between Existing Competitors When there are several competitors in an industry, there will generally be more price competition and lower profit margins as competitors seek to expand their share of the market. Slow industry growth contributes to this competition because expansion must come at the expense of a rival's market share. High fixed costs also create pressure to reduce prices because they put greater pressure on firms to operate near full capacity. Industries producing relatively homogeneous goods are also subject to considerable price pressure because firms cannot compete on the basis of product differentiation.

Pressure from Substitute Products Substitute products means that the industry faces competition from firms in related industries. For example, sugar producers compete with corn syrup producers. Wool producers compete with synthetic fiber producers. The availability of substitutes limits the prices that can be charged to customers.

Bargaining Power of Buyers If a buyer purchases a large fraction of an industry's output, it will have considerable bargaining power and can demand price concessions. For example, auto producers can put pressure on suppliers of auto parts. This reduces the profitability of the auto parts industry.

Bargaining Power of Suppliers If a supplier of a key input has monopolistic control over the product, it can demand higher prices for the good and squeeze profits out of the industry. One special case of this issue pertains to organized labor as a supplier of a key input to the production process. Labor unions engage in collective bargaining to increase the wages paid to workers. When the labor market is highly unionized, a significant share of the potential profits in the industry can be captured by the workforce.

The key factor determining the bargaining power of suppliers is the availability of substitute products. If substitutes are available, the supplier has little clout and cannot extract higher prices.

# SUMMARY

1. Macroeconomic policy aims to maintain the economy near full employment without aggravating inflationary pressures. The proper trade-off between these two goals is a source of ongoing debate.
2. The traditional tools of macroeconomic policy are government spending and tax collection, which constitute fiscal policy, and manipulation of the money supply via monetary policy. Expansionary fiscal policy can stimulate the economy and increase GDP but tends to increase interest rates. Expansionary monetary policy works by lowering interest rates.
3. The business cycle is the economy's recurring pattern of expansions and recessions. Leading economic indicators can be used to anticipate the evolution of the business cycle because their values tend to change before those of other key economic variables.
4. Industries differ in their sensitivity to the business cycle. More sensitive industries tend to be those producing high-priced durable goods for which the consumer has considerable discretion as to the timing of purchase. Examples are jewelry, automobiles, or consumer durables. Other sensitive industries are those that produce capital equipment for other firms. Operating leverage and financial leverage increase sensitivity to the business cycle.
5. Industries generally pass through a predictable life cycle. In the start-up stage, growth is rapid as a new product begins to permeate the economy, but it is difficult at this point to predict which firms will emerge as industry leaders. As the product becomes established, the industry enters a consolidation stage and industry leaders begin to emerge. In the maturity stage, the product has largely saturated the market, and further growth merely tracks that of the general economy. Finally, the industry enters a stage of relative decline as it faces competition from new products.

Use the following case in answering Problems 18 through 21: Institutional Advisors for All Inc., or IAAI, is a consulting firm that advises foundations, endowments, pension plans, and insurance companies. The research department predicts an upward trend in job creation and consumer confidence, which it expects to continue for the next few years. Other domestic leading indicators that the research department considers are industrial production, average weekly hours in manufacturing, the S&P 500 stock index, the money supply, and the index of consumer expectations.

In light of the predictions for job creation and consumer confidence, the investment advisers at IAAI want to make recommendations for their clients. Their primary concern is to forecast how the trends in job creation and consumer confidence should affect bond prices and how those trends should affect stock prices.

The research department also notes that stocks have been trending up in the past year, and this information is factored into their forecasts of the overall economy. The researchers consider an upward-trending stock market a positive economic indicator in itself; however, they disagree as to the reason this should be the case.

18. IAAI foresees positive trends for both job creation and consumer confidence. Which, if either, of these trends should have a positive effect on stock prices?
19. Stock prices are useful as a leading indicator. To explain this phenomenon, which of the following is most accurate? Stock prices:

$a$ . Predict future interest rates as well as trends in other indicators.
b. Do not predict future interest rates, nor are they correlated with other leading indicators; the usefulness of stock prices as a leading indicator is a mystery.
c. Reflect the trends in other leading indicators only and do not have predictive power of their own.

20. Which of the domestic series that the IAAI research department listed for use as leading indicators is least appropriate?

a. Industrial production.
$b$ . Average weekly hours in manufacturing.
c. The S&P 500 index.

21. IAAI uses primarily historical data in its calculations and forecasts. Which of the following regarding the actions of IAAI is most accurate?

a. Credit risk premiums may be useful to IAAI because they are based on actual market expectations.
b. IAAI should use a moving average of recent stock returns when times are bad because it will result in a high expected equity risk premium.
$c$ . Long time spans should be used so that regime changes can be factored into the forecasts.

Use the following case in answering Problems 22 through 25: Mary Smith, a CFA candidate, was recently hired for an analyst position at a large bank in London. Her first assignment is to examine the competitive strategies employed by various French wineries.

Smith's report identifies four wineries that are the major players in the French wine industry. Key characteristics of each are cited in Table 17A. In the body of Smith's report, she notes that over the past five years, the French wine industry has not responded to changing consumer tastes. Profit margins have declined steadily, and the number of firms representing the industry has decreased from 10 to 4. It appears that participants in the French wine industry must consolidate in order to survive.

Smith's report notes that French consumers have strong bargaining power over the industry. She supports this conclusion with the following key points:

- Many consumers are drinking more beer than wine with meals and at social occasions.
- Increasing sales over the Internet have allowed consumers to better research the wines, read opinions from other customers, and identify which producers have the best prices.
- The French wine industry is consolidating and consists of only 4 wineries today compared to 10 wineries five years ago.
- More than $65\%$ of the business for the French wine industry consists of purchases from restaurants. Restaurants typically make purchases in bulk, buying four to five cases of wine at a time.
- Land where the soil is fertile enough to grow grapes necessary for the wine production process is scarce in France.

Smith takes her report to her boss, Sandra VanDriesen, to review and tells her, "In my report I have classified the South Winery as a stuck-in-the-middle firm. It tries to be a consumer cost leader by selling its wine at a price that is slightly below the other firms, but it also tries to differentiate itself from its competitors by producing wine in bottles with curved necks, which increases its cost structure. The end result is that the South Winery's profit margin gets squeezed from both sides." VanDriesen replies, I believe that the South Winery could succeed at following both a cost leadership and a differentiation strategy if its operations were separated into distinct operating units, with each unit pursuing a different competitive strategy." Smith makes a note to do more research on generic competitive strategies to verify VanDriesen's assertions before publishing the final draft of her report.

Characteristics of Four Major French Wineries

22. If the French home currency were to greatly appreciate in value compared to the English currency, what is the likely impact on the competitive position of the East Winery?

$a$  .Make the firm less competitive in the English market.
$b$ . No impact because the major market for East Winery is England, not France.
$c$ . Make the firm more competitive in the English market.

23. Which of Smith's points effectively support the conclusion that consumers have strong bargaining power over the industry?

24. Smith notes in her report that the West Winery might differentiate its wine product on attributes that buyers perceive to be important. Which of the following attributes would be the most likely area of focus for the West Winery to create a differentiated product?

$a$ . The method of delivery for the product.
$b$  . The price of the product.
c. A focus on customers aged 30-45.

25. Smith makes three observations about the North Winery and its strategic planning process: i. North Winery's price and cost forecasts account for its forecasted changes in the structure of the French wine industry.

ii. North Winery places each of its business units into one of three categories: build, hold, or harvest [i.e., divest].
iii. North Winery uses market share as the key measure of its competitive position.

Which observation(s) least support(s) the conclusion that the North Winery's strategic planning process is guided and informed by its generic competitive strategy?

26. Atech has fixed costs of \$7 million and profits of \$4 million. Its competitor, ZTech, is roughly the same size and this year earned the same profits, \$4 million. However, ZTech operates with fixed costs of only \$5 million but higher variable costs.

$a$ . Which firm has higher operating leverage?
b. Which firm would you expect to have profits that are more sensitive to the state of the economy?
c. Which firm would you expect to have the higher stock market beta?

27. OceanGate sells external hard drives for \$200 each. Its total fixed costs are \$30 million, and its variable costs per unit are 140. The corporate tax rate is 21\%. If the economy is strong, the firm will sell 2 million drives, but if there is a recession, it will sell only half as many.

a. What will be the percentage decline in sales if the economy enters a recession?
$b$ . What will be the percentage decline in profits if the economy enters a recession?
c. Comparing your answers to (a) and (b), how would you measure the operating leverage of this firm?

1. Briefly discuss what actions the U.S. Federal Reserve would likely take in pursuing an expansionary monetary policy using each of the following three monetary tools: a. Reserve requirements.

$b$  . Open market operations.
c. Discount rate.

2. An unanticipated expansionary monetary policy has been implemented. Indicate the impact of this policy on each of the following four variables: a. Inflation rate.

$b$ . Real output and employment.
$c$ . Real interest rate.
$d$ . Nominal interest rate.

3. Universal Auto is a large multinational corporation headquartered in the United States. For segment reporting purposes, the company is engaged in two businesses: production of motor vehicles and information processing services.

The motor vehicle business is by far the larger of Universal's two segments. It consists mainly of domestic U.S. passenger car production, but it also includes small truck manufacturing operations in the United States and passenger car production in other countries. This segment of Universal has had weak operating results for the past several years, including a large loss in 2022. Although the company does not reveal the operating results of its domestic passenger car segments, that part of Universal's business is generally believed to be primarily responsible for the weak performance of its motor vehicle segment.

Idata, the information processing services segment of Universal, was started by Universal about 15 years ago. This business has shown strong, steady growth that has been entirely internal; no acquisitions have been made.

An excerpt from a research report on Universal prepared by Paul Adams, a CFA candidate, states: "Based on our assumption that Universal will be able to increase prices significantly on U.S. passenger cars in 2023, we project a multibillion dollar profit improvement."

$a$ . Discuss the concept of an industrial life cycle by describing each of its four phases.
$b$ . Identify where each of Universal's two primary businesses—passenger cars and information processing—is in such a cycle.
c. Discuss how product pricing should differ between Universal's two businesses, based on the location of each in the industrial life cycle.

4. Adams's research report (see CFA Problem 3) continued as follows: "With a business recovery already under way, the expected profit surge should lead to a much higher price for Universal Auto stock. We strongly recommend purchase."

a. Discuss the business cycle approach to investment timing. (Your answer should describe actions to be taken on both stocks and bonds at different points over a typical business cycle.) b. Assuming Adams's assertion is correct (that a business recovery is already under way), evaluate the timeliness of his recommendation to purchase Universal Auto, a cyclical stock, based on the business cycle approach to investment timing.

5. Janet Ludlow is preparing a report on U.S.-based manufacturers in the electric toothbrush industry and has gathered the information shown in Tables 17B and 17C. Ludlow's report concludes that the electric toothbrush industry is in the maturity (i.e., late) phase of its industry life cycle.

a. Select and justify three factors from Table 17B that support Ludlow's conclusion.
b. Select and justify three factors from Table 17C that refute Ludlow's conclusion.

Ratios for electric toothbrush industry index and broad stock market index

- Industry Sales Growth—Industry sales have grown at $15 - 20\%$ per year in recent years and are expected to grow at $10 - 15\%$ per year over the next 3 years.
Non-U.S. Markets—Some U.S. manufacturers are attempting to enter fast-growing non-U.S. markets, which remain largely unexploited.
- Mail Order Sales—Some manufacturers have created a new niche in the industry by selling electric toothbrushes directly to customers through mail order. Sales for this industry segment are growing at $40\%$ per year.
U.S. Market Penetration—The current penetration rate in the United States is $60\%$ of households and will be difficult to increase.
- Price Competition—Manufacturers compete fiercely on the basis of price, and price wars within the industry are common.
- Niche Markets—Some manufacturers are able to develop new, unexploited niche markets in the United States based on company reputation, quality, and service.
- Industry Consolidation—Several manufacturers have recently merged, and it is expected that consolidation in the industry will increase.
- New Entrants-New manufacturers continue to enter the market.

6. As a securities analyst, you have been asked to review a valuation of a closely held business, Wigwam Autoparts Heaven, Inc. (WAH), prepared by the Red Rocks Group (RRG). You are asked to give an opinion on the valuation and to support your opinion by analyzing each part of the valuation. WAH's sole business is automotive parts retailing. The RRG valuation includes a section called "Analysis of the Retail Autoparts Industry," based completely on the data in Table 17D and the following additional information:

- WAH and its principal competitors each operated more than 150 stores at year-end 2022.
- The average number of stores operated per company engaged in the retail autoparts industry is 5.3.
- The major customer base for autoparts sold in retail stores consists of young owners of old vehicles. These owners do their own automotive maintenance out of economic necessity.

a. One of RRG's conclusions is that the retail autoparts industry as a whole is in the maturity stage of the industry life cycle. Discuss three relevant items of data from Table 17D that support this conclusion.
b. Another RRG conclusion is that WAH and its principal competitors are in the consolidation stage of their life cycle.

i. Cite three relevant items of data from Table 17D that support this conclusion.
ii. Explain how WAH and its principal competitors can be in a consolidation stage while their industry as a whole is in the maturity stage.

ii. Appreciated and the British will find U.S. goods more expensive.
iii. Depreciated and the British will find U.S. goods more expensive.
iv. Depreciated and the British will find U.S. goods cheaper.

$b$ . Changes in which of the following are likely to affect interest rates?

i. Inflation expectations.
ii. Size of the federal deficit.
iii. Money supply.

c. According to the supply-side view of fiscal policy, if the impact on total tax revenues is the same, does it make any difference whether the government cuts taxes by either reducing marginal tax rates or increasing the personal exemption allowance?

i. No, both methods of cutting taxes will exert the same impact on aggregate supply.
ii. No, people in both cases will increase their saving, expecting higher future taxes, and thereby offset the stimulus effect of lower current taxes.
