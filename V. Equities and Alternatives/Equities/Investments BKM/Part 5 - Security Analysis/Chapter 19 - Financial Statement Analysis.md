# Financial Statement Analysis

# 19

IN THE PREVIOUS chapter, we explored equity valuation techniques. These techniques take the firm's dividends and earnings prospects as inputs. Although the analyst is interested in economic earnings streams, only financial accounting data are readily available. What can we learn from a company's financial statements that can help us estimate the intrinsic value of its common stock? In this chapter, we show how investors use financial data as inputs in their valuation analysis.

We start by reviewing the basic sources of such data—the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows. We note the difference between economic and accounting earnings. Although economic earnings are more important for issues of valuation, they can at best be estimated, so, in practice, analysts always begin with accounting data. We show how analysts use financial ratios to explore the sources of a firm's profitability and evaluate the "quality" of its earnings in a systematic fashion. We also examine the impact of debt policy on various financial ratios.


Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the challenges you will encounter when using financial statement analysis as a tool in uncovering mispriced securities. Some of these issues arise from differences in firms' accounting procedures. Others are due to inflation-induced distortions in accounting numbers.

# 19.1 The Major Financial Statements

# The Income Statement

The income statement summarizes the profitability of the firm over a period of time, such as a year. It presents revenues generated during that period, the expenses incurred, and the company's net income, which is simply the difference between revenues and expenses.

The firm incurs four broad classes of expenses: cost of goods sold, which is the direct cost attributable to producing the product sold by the firm; general and administrative expenses, which correspond to overhead expenses, salaries, advertising, and other costs of operating the firm that are not directly attributable to production; interest expense on the firm's debt; and taxes owed to federal and local governments.


Table 19.1 presents an income statement for Target. At the top are the company's revenues from operations. Next come operating expenses (i.e., the costs incurred in the course of generating those revenues, including a depreciation allowance). The difference between operating revenues and operating costs is called operating income. Income or expenses from other, primarily nonrecurring, sources are then added or subtracted to obtain earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which is what the firm would have earned if not for obligations to its creditors and the tax authorities. EBIT measures profitability abstracting from the interest burden attributable to debt financing. Next, we subtract net interest expense from EBIT to find taxable income. Finally, the income tax due the government is subtracted to arrive at net income, the "bottom line" of the income statement.

Analysts also commonly prepare a common-size income statement, in which all items on the income statement are expressed as a percent of total revenue. This makes it easier to compare firms of different sizes. The right-hand column of Table 19.1 is Target's common-size income statement.

In the previous chapter, we saw that stock valuation models require a measure of economic earnings—the sustainable cash flow that can be paid out to stockholders without impairing the productive capacity of the firm. In contrast, accounting earnings are affected by several conventions, among them, the valuation of assets such as inventories (e.g., LIFO versus FIFO treatment) and the way some expenditures such as capital investments are recognized over time (as depreciation expenses). We discuss questions raised by some of these accounting conventions in greater detail later in the chapter. In addition to these accounting issues, as the firm makes its way through the business cycle, its earnings will rise above or fall below the trend line that might more accurately reflect its sustainable economic earnings. This introduces an added complication in interpreting net income. Given all of these

In fact, financial statements clearly convey considerable information: Stock prices respond vigorously when firms announce earnings that differ from the prior expectations of market analysts or investors.

# The Balance Sheet

While the income statement provides a measure of profitability over a period of time, the balance sheet provides a "snapshot" of the financial condition of the firm at a particular moment. The balance sheet is a list of the firm's assets and liabilities. The difference in assets and liabilities is the net worth of the firm, also called shareholders' or stockholders' equity. Like income statements, balance sheets are reasonably standardized in presentation.

Table 190.2 is Target's balance sheet. The first section lists the firm's assets. Current assets are presented first. These are cash and other items such as accounts receivable or inventories that will be converted into cash within one year. Next comes a listing of long-term or "fixed" assets. Tangible fixed assets are items such as buildings, equipment, or vehicles. Target also has several intangible assets such as a respected brand name and expertise. But accountants generally are reluctant to include these assets on the balance sheet, as they are so hard to value. However, when one firm purchases another for a premium over its current market value (the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities), that difference, called "goodwill," is listed on the balance sheet as an intangible fixed asset. Target lists goodwill at  \ {633}  million.  {}^{1}  The sum of current and fixed assets is total assets,the last line of the assets section of the balance sheet.

The liability and shareholders' equity (also called stockholders' equity) section is arranged similarly. First come short-term, or "current," liabilities such as accounts payable and debts due within one year. Following this are long-term debt and other liabilities due in more than one year. The difference between total assets and total liabilities is stockholders' equity. This is the net worth, or book value, of the firm.

Stockholders' equity is divided into par value of stock, additional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, although this division is usually unimportant. Briefly, par value plus additional paid-in capital represent the proceeds realized from the sale of stock to the public. Conversely, when the firm repurchases stock from the public, this is treated as a "negative share issuance," and shareholders' equity falls. These repurchased shares are held in the company's treasury and are, therefore, known as treasury stock. The shares held by investors are said to be issued and outstanding. Target's par value plus paid-in capital is 6,371. Of course, considerable profits have been reinvested in the business on the shareholders' behalf, and this shows up as retained earnings in Table 190.2. The entry for retained earnings shows the cumulative buildup of equity from profits plowed back into the firm.

The entries in the left-hand columns of the balance sheet in Table 190.2 present the dollar value of each asset. Just as they compute common-size income statements, however, analysts also find it convenient to use common-size balance sheets when comparing firms of different sizes. Therefore, each item is also expressed as a percentage of total assets. These entries appear in the right-hand columns of Table 190.2.

# The Statement of Cash Flows

The income statement and balance sheets are based on accrual methods of accounting, which means that revenues and expenses are recognized at the time of a sale even if no cash has yet been exchanged. In contrast, the statement of cash flows tracks the cash implications of transactions. For example, if goods are sold now, with payment due in 60 days, the income statement will treat the revenue as generated when the sale occurs, and the balance sheet will be immediately augmented by accounts receivable, but the statement of cash flows is concerned with when the bill is paid and the cash is in hand.

Table 19.3 is the statement of cash flows for Target. The first entry listed under "cash provided by operations" is net income. The next entries modify that figure for components of income that have been recognized but for which cash has not yet changed hands. For example, Target's accounts receivable increased by 299 million. This portion of sales was claimed on the income statement, but the cash had not yet been collected. Increases in accounts receivable are in effect an investment in working capital and, therefore, reduce the cash flows realized from operations. Similarly, increases in accounts payable mean that expenses have been recognized, but cash has not yet left the firm. Any payment delay increases the company's net cash flows in this period.

Another major difference between the income statement and the statement of cash flows involves depreciation, which is a major addition to income in the adjustment section of the statement of cash flows. The income statement attempts to "smooth" large capital expenditures over time. The depreciation expense does this by recognizing such expenditures over a period of many years rather than at the specific time of purchase. In contrast, the statement

Table 19.3

Statement of cash flows for Target of cash flows recognizes the cash implication of a capital expenditure when it occurs. Therefore, it adds back the depreciation "expense" that was used to compute net income; instead, it acknowledges a capital expenditure when it is paid. It does so by reporting cash flows separately for operations, investing, and financing activities. This way, any large cash flows, such as those for big investments, can be recognized without affecting the measure of cash provided by operations.


The second section of the statement of cash flows focuses on cash flows from investing activities. For example, Target used  \$2,649 million of cash investing in tangible fixed assets. On the other hand,\$ 58 million was freed up by disinvestments in other assets. These entries are investments in the assets necessary for the firm to maintain or enhance its productive capacity.

Finally, the last section of the statement lists the cash flows realized from financing activities. Issuance of securities will contribute positive cash flows, while repurchase or redemption of outstanding securities uses up cash. For example, Target expended  \$745 million to repurchase shares of its stock, which was a major use of cash. Its dividend payments,\$ 1,343 million, also used cash. In total, Target's financing activities absorbed 2,000 million.

To summarize, Target's operations generated a cash flow of  \$10,525 million. Some of that cash,\$ 2,591 million, went to pay for new investments. Another part, \$2,000 million, went to pay dividends and retire outstanding securities. Target's cash holdings therefore increased by 10,525 - 2,591 - 2,000 = \$5,934 million. This is reported on the last line of Table 19.3.

The statement of cash flows provides important evidence on the well-being of a firm. If a company cannot pay its dividends and maintain the productivity of its capital stock out of cash flow from operations, for example, and must resort to borrowing to meet these demands, this is a warning that it cannot maintain the dividend payout at its current level in the long run. The statement of cash flows will reveal this developing problem when it shows that cash flow from operations is inadequate and that borrowing is being used to maintain dividend payments at unsustainable levels.

# 190.2 Measuring Firm Performance

In Chapter 1, we pointed out that a natural goal of the firm is to maximize value but that various agency problems, or conflicts of interest, may impede that goal. How can we measure how well the firm is actually performing? Financial analysts have come up with a mind-numbing list of financial ratios that measure many aspects of firm performance. Before getting lost in the trees, let's first pause to consider what sorts of ratios may be related to the ultimate objective of added value.

Two broad activities are the responsibility of a firm's financial managers: investments and financing. Investment, or capital budgeting, decisions pertain to the firm's use of capital: the business activities in which it is engaged. Here, our concern is the profitability of those projects. How should profitability be measured? How does the acceptable level of profitability depend on risk and the opportunity cost of the funds used to pay for the firm's many projects? In contrast, financial decisions pertain to the firm's sources of capital. Is there a sufficient supply of financing to meet projected needs for growth? Does the financing plan rely too heavily on borrowed funds? Is there sufficient liquidity to deal with unexpected cash needs?

Figure 19.1 Important financial questions and some ratios that help answer them

These questions suggest that we organize financial ratios along the lines given in Figure 19.1. The figure shows that when evaluating the firm's investment activities, we ask two broad sets of questions. In the left panel, we ask how efficiently does the firm deploy its assets, and how profitable are its sales? In turn, aspects of both efficiency and profitability can be measured with several ratios. Efficiency is typically assessed using turnover ratios, while the profitability of sales is commonly measured with various profit margins. In the right panel, we evaluate the prudence of the firm's financing decisions, assessing both leverage and liquidity; aspects of each of these two concepts also can be measured with an array of statistics.

The next section explains how to calculate and interpret some of these key financial ratios and shows how many of them are related.

# 19.3 Profitability Measures

Big firms naturally earn greater profits than smaller ones. Therefore, most profitability measures focus on earnings per dollar employed. The most common measures are return on assets, return on capital, and return on equity.

# Return on Assets, ROA

Return on assets (ROA) equals earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) as a fraction of the firm's total assets0.2

$$
\mathrm {R O A} = \frac {\mathrm {E B I T}}{\text {T o t a l a s s e t s}}
$$

The numerator of this ratio may be viewed (abstracting from one-off expenses or income sources) as the firm's operating income. Therefore, ROA tells us operating income per dollar deployed in the firm.

# Return on Capital, ROC

Whereas ROA compares EBIT to total assets, return on capital (ROC) expresses EBIT as a fraction of long-term capital (i.e., shareholders' equity plus long-term debt). It measures earnings per dollar of long-term capital invested in the firm.

$$
\mathrm {R O C} = \frac {\mathrm {E B I T}}{\text {L o n g - t e r m c a p i t a l}}
$$

# Return on Equity, ROE

Whereas ROA and ROC measure profitability relative to funds raised by both debt and equity financing, return on equity (ROE) focuses only on the profitability of equity investments. It equals net income realized by shareholders per dollar they have invested in the firm.

$$
\mathrm {R O E} = \frac {\text {N e t i n c o m e}}{\text {S h a r e h o l d s} ^ {\prime} \text {e q u i t y}}
$$

We saw in Chapter 18 that ROE is one of the two basic factors in determining a firm's growth rate of earnings. Sometimes it is reasonable to assume that future ROE will approximate its current value, but a high ROE in the past does not necessarily imply a firm's future ROE will be high. It can be dangerous to accept historical values as indicators of future values. While data from the recent past may provide information regarding expected performance, keep your focus on the future.

Not surprisingly, ROA and ROE are linked, but as we will see next, their relationship is affected by the firm's financial policies.

# Financial Leverage and ROE

ROE is affected by the firm's debt-equity mix as well as the interest rate on its debt. An example will show why. Suppose Nodett is a firm that is all-equity financed and has total assets of 100 million. Assume its corporate tax rate is 20\%. (The exact corporate tax rate in 2022 was 21\%).

Table 19.4 shows Nodett's sales, earnings before interest and taxes, and net profits under three scenarios representing phases of the business cycle. It also shows two of the most commonly used profitability measures: operating ROA, which equals EBIT/Assets, and ROE, which equals net profits/equity.

Somdett is an otherwise identical firm to Nodett, but it has financed  \$40 million of its\$ 100 million of assets with debt bearing an interest rate of 8\%. It therefore pays annual interest expenses of 30.2 million. Table 19.5 shows how Somdett's ROE differs from Nodett's.

Annual sales, EBIT, and therefore ROA for both firms are the same in each of the three scenarios; in other words, business risk for the two companies is identical. But their financial risk differs. Although Nodett and Somdett have the same ROA in each scenario, Somdett's ROE exceeds that of Nodett in normal and good years and is lower in bad years.

Table 19.4
Nodett's profitability over the business cycle

<table><tr><td>Scenario</td><td>Sales ($ millions)</td><td>EBIT ($ millions)</td><td>ROA (\% per year)</td><td>Net Profit* ($ millions)</td><td>ROE (\% per year)</td></tr><tr><td>Bad year</td><td>80</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Normal year</td><td>100</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Good year</td><td>120</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr></table>

*Somdett's after-tax profits are given by (1 - 0.2) × (EBIT - 30.2 million).
$^{\dagger}$ ROE = Net profit/Equity. Somdett's equity is only 60 million, so ROE = Net profit/60.

# Table 19.5

Impact of financial leverage on ROE

We can summarize the exact relationship among ROE, ROA, and leverage in the following equation:

$$
\mathrm {R O E} = (1 - \text {T a x r a t e}) \left[ \mathrm {R O A} + (\mathrm {R O A} - \text {I n t e r s t r a t e}) \frac {\text {D e b t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} \right] \tag {19.1}
$$

This result makes sense: If ROA exceeds the borrowing rate, the firm earns more on its investments than it pays out to creditors. The surplus earnings are available to the firm's equityholders, which increases ROE. If, on the other hand, ROA is less than the interest rate paid on debt, then ROE will decline by an amount that depends on the debt-to-equity ratio.

# Example 19.1 Leverage and ROE

To illustrate the application of Equation 19.1, look at Table 19.5. In a normal year, Nodett has an ROE of  $8\%$ , which is .8 (i.e., 1 minus the tax rate) times its ROA of  $10\%$ . However, Somdett, which borrows at an interest rate of  $8\%$  and maintains a debt-to-equity ratio of  $2/3$ , has an ROE of  $9.07\%$ . The calculation using Equation 19.1 is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {ROE} = . 8 [ 10 \% + (10 \% - 8 \%) ^ {2 / 3} ] \\ = .8[10\% +4 / 3\% ] = 9.07\% \\ \end{array}
$$

Somdett's debt makes a positive contribution to ROE in this scenario because the firm's ROA exceeds the interest rate on its debt.

Table 19.5 shows that financial leverage increases the risk of equityholder returns. Somdett's ROE is worse than Nodett's in bad years, but it is better in good years. The presence of debt makes Somdett's ROE more sensitive to the business cycle. Even though the two companies have equal business risk (reflected in their identical EBITs in all three scenarios), Somdett's stockholders bear greater financial risk than Nodett's because all of the firm's business risk is absorbed by a smaller base of equity investors.

3The derivation of Equation 19.1 is as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {R O E} = \frac {\text {N e t p r o f i t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} = \frac {\text {E B I T - I n t e r s t - T a x e s}}{\text {E q u i t y}} = \frac {(1 - \text {T a x r a t e}) (\text {E B I T - I n t e r s t})}{\text {E q u i t y}} \\ = (1 - \text {T a x r a t e}) \left[ \frac {\left(\mathrm {R O A} \times \text {A s s e t s}\right) - (\text {I n t e r e s t r a t e} \times \text {D e b t})}{\text {E q u i t y}} \right] \\ = (1 - \text {T a x r a t e}) \left[ \mathrm {R O A} \times \frac {\text {E q u i t y} + \text {D e b t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} - \text {I n t e r s t r a t e} \times \frac {\text {D e b t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} \right] \\ = (1 - \text {T a x r a t e}) \left[ \text {R O A} + (\text {R O A} - \text {I n t e r e s t r a t e}) \frac {\text {D e b t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

Even if financial leverage increases the expected ROE of Somdett relative to Nodett (as it seems to in Table 19.5), this does not imply that Somdett's share price will be higher. Financial leverage increases the risk of the firm's equity as surely as it raises the expected ROE, and the correspondingly higher discount rate will offset the higher expected earnings.

# Concept Check 19.1

Mordett has the same assets as Nodett and Somdett, but its debt-to-equity ratio is 1.0 and its interest rate is  $9\%$ . What will its net profit and ROE be in a bad year, a normal year, and a good year?

# Economic Value Added

While profitability measures such as ROA, ROC, and ROE are commonly used to measure performance, profitability is really not enough. A firm should be viewed as successful only if the return on its projects is better than the rate investors could expect to earn for themselves (on a risk-adjusted basis) in the capital market. Plowing back funds into the firm increases stock price only if the firm earns a higher rate of return on those funds than the opportunity cost of capital, that is, the market capitalization rate. To account for this opportunity cost, we can measure the success of the firm using the difference between the return on capital, ROC, and the opportunity cost of capital,  $k$ . Economic value added (EVA) is the spread between ROC and  $k$  multiplied by the capital invested in the firm. It therefore measures the dollar value of the firm's return in excess of its opportunity cost. Another term for EVA (the term coined by Stern Stewart, a consulting firm that has promoted its use) is residual income.

# Example 190.2 Economic Value Added

In 2021, Intel had a weighted-average cost of capital of  $60.26\%$  (based on its cost of debt, its capital structure, its equity beta, and estimates derived from the CAPM for the cost of equity). Its return on capital was  $90.27\%$ , which was  $3.01\%$  greater than the opportunity cost of capital on its investments in plant, equipment, and know-how. In other words, each dollar invested by Intel earned about 3.01 cents more than the return that investors could have anticipated by investing in equivalent-risk stocks. It earned this superior rate of return on a capital base of \$1120.2 billion. Its economic value added, that is, its return in excess of opportunity cost, was therefore (.0927 - .0626) × $1120.2 = $3.38 billion.

Table 19.6 shows EVA for a small sample of firms. $^{4}$  The EVA leader in this sample was Apple, whose large EVA resulted from an extremely high ROC applied to an enormous capital base. But now compare Intel to Coca-Cola. Both firms had almost identical margins between ROC and cost of capital. Yet Intel's EVA was nearly four times that of Coke. This is because Intel applied its margin to a much larger capital base. At the other extreme, Ford and AT&T earned less than their opportunity costs of capital, which resulted in negative EVAs.

Notice that even the EVA "losers" in Table 19.6 reported positive accounting profits. For example, by conventional standards, AT&T was solidly profitable, with a positive ROC of  $3.51\%$ . But its cost of capital was higher, at  $4.99\%$ . By this standard, it did not

4Actual EVA estimates reported by Stern Stewart differ from the values in Table 19.6 because of adjustments to the accounting data involving issues such as treatment of research and development expenses, taxes, advertising expenses, and depreciation.

Table 19.6

Economic value added, 2021 cover its opportunity cost of capital and, therefore, returned a negative EVA. EVA treats the opportunity cost of capital as a real cost that should be deducted from revenues to arrive at a more meaningful "bottom line." A firm that is generating accounting profits but not covering its opportunity cost might be able to redeploy its capital to better uses. Therefore, many firms calculate EVA and tie managers' compensation to it.


On the other hand, while EVA has many advantages over return on capital as a means of evaluating management, it is not perfect. Notice Walt Disney's large negative EVA in 2021. This largely reflected the impact of COVID-19 on theme park revenues, and it would seem inappropriate to hold management responsible for that. Still, EVA does reflect the opportunity cost borne by shareholders, regardless of where the blame lies.

# 19.4 Ratio Analysis

# Decomposition of ROE

To understand the factors affecting a firm's ROE, particularly its trend over time and its performance relative to competitors, analysts often "decompose" ROE into the product of a series of ratios. Each component ratio is in itself meaningful, and the process serves to focus the analyst's attention on the separate factors influencing performance. This kind of decomposition of ROE is often called the DuPont system.

One useful decomposition of ROE is

$$
\mathrm {R O E} = \frac {\text {N e t p r o f i t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} = \frac {\text {N e t p r o f i t s}}{\text {P r e t a x p r o f i t s}} \times \frac {\text {P r e t a x p r o f i t s}}{\text {E B I T}} \times \frac {\text {E B I T}}{\text {S a l e s}} \times \frac {\text {S a l e s}}{\text {A s s e t s}} \times \frac {\text {A s s e t s}}{\text {E q u i t y}} \tag {190.2}
$$

(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)

Table 19.7 shows these ratios for Nodett and Somdett in each of the three economic scenarios. Let us first focus on factors 3 and 4. Notice that their product equals EBIT/Assets, which is the firm's ROA.

Factor 3 is known as the firm's operating profit margin or return on sales (ROS), which equals operating profit per dollar of sales. In a normal year, profit margin is .10, or  $10\%$ ; in a bad year, it is .0625, or  $60.25\%$ ; and in a good year, it is .125, or  $12.5\%$ .

Ratio decomposition analysis for Nodett and Somdett

Table 19.7

Factor 4, the ratio of sales to total assets, is known as total asset turnover (ATO). It measures the annual sales generated by each dollar of assets, so it is widely interpreted as a measure of the efficiency with which the firm uses its assets. In a normal year, ATO for both firms is 1.0 per year, meaning that sales of 1 per year were generated per dollar of assets. In a bad year, this ratio declines to .8 per year, and in a good year, it rises to 10.2 per year.

Comparing Nodett and Somdett, we see that factors 3 and 4 do not depend on a firm's financial leverage. The firms' ratios equal each other in each scenario. Similarly, factor 1, the ratio of net income after taxes to pretax profit, is the same for both firms. We call this the tax-burden ratio. Its value reflects both the government's tax code and the policies pursued by the firm in trying to minimize its tax burden. In our example, it does not change over the business cycle, remaining a constant .8.

Although factors 1, 3, and 4 are not affected by a firm's capital structure, factors 2 and 5 are. Factor 2 is the ratio of pretax profits to EBIT. The firm's pretax profits are greatest when there are no interest payments owed to debtholders. In fact, another way to express this ratio is

$$
\frac {\text {P r e t a x p r o f i t s}}{\text {E B I T}} = \frac {\text {E B I T} - \text {I n t e r e s t e x p e n s e}}{\text {E B I T}}
$$

We call this factor the interest-burden ratio. It takes on its highest possible value, 1, for Nodett, which has no debt and therefore no interest expense. The higher the degree of financial leverage, the lower the interest-burden ratio. Nodett's ratio does not vary over the business cycle. It is fixed at 1.0, reflecting the absence of interest payments. For Somdett, however, because interest expense is fixed while EBIT varies, the interest burden ratio varies from a low of .36 in a bad year to a high of .787 in a good year.

A closely related statistic to the interest-burden ratio is the interest coverage ratio, or times interest earned. The ratio is defined as

A high coverage ratio indicates that annual earnings are significantly greater than annual interest obligations. It is widely used by both lenders and borrowers in determining the firm's debt capacity and is a major determinant of the firm's bond rating.

Factor 5, the ratio of assets to equity, is a measure of the firm's degree of financial leverage. It is called the leverage ratio and is equal to 1 plus the total debt-to-equity ratio. As shown in Table 19.7, Nodett has a leverage ratio of 1, while Somdett's leverage ratio is 1.667.

From our discussion in Section 190.2, we know that financial leverage boosts ROE only if ROA is greater than the interest rate on the firm's debt. How is this fact reflected in the ratios of Table 19.7?

The full impact of leverage equals the product of the interest burden and leverage ratios (i.e., factors 2 and 5 in Table 19.7). This product is called the compound leverage factor and is shown in Column 6. Nodett's compound leverage factor equals 1.0 in all three scenarios. In contrast, Somdett's compound leverage factor is greater than 1.0 in normal years (1.133) and in good years (1.311), indicating a positive contribution of financial leverage to ROE. It is less than 1 in bad years, reflecting the fact that when ROA falls below the interest rate, ROE falls with increased use of debt.

We can summarize all of these relationships as follows. From Equation 190.2,

ROE = Tax burden × Interest burden × Margin × Turnover × Leverage

Because

$$
\mathrm {R O A} = \text {M a r g i n} \times \text {T u r n o v e r} \tag {19.3}
$$ and


Compound leverage factor = Interest burden × Leverage we can decompose ROE equivalently as follows:


$$
\mathrm {R O E} = \text {T a x b u r d e n} \times \mathrm {R O A} \times \text {C o m p o u n d l e v e r a g e f a c t o r} \tag {19.4}
$$

Equation 19.3 shows that ROA is the product of margin and turnover. High values of one of these ratios are often accompanied by low values of the other. For example, Walmart has low profit margins but high turnover, while the luxury brand firm LVMH has high margins but low turnover. Firms would love to have high values for both margin and turnover, but this generally will not be possible: Retailers with high markups will sacrifice sales volume, while those with low turnover need high margins just to remain viable. Therefore, comparing these ratios in isolation usually is meaningful only in evaluating firms following similar strategies in the same industry.

Figure 190.2 shows evidence of the turnover-profit margin trade-off. Each point in the figure corresponds to the profit margin-turnover pair for one particular industry. Industries with high turnover, such as retail stores, tend to have low profit margins, while industries with high margins, such as utilities, tend to have low turnover. The two curved lines trace out turnover-margin combinations that result in an ROA of either  $2\%$  or  $10\%$ . You can see that most industries lie inside of this range, so ROA across industries demonstrates far less variation than either turnover or margin taken in isolation.

$$
\frac {{} ^ {5} \text {A s s e t s}}{\text {E q u i t y}} = \frac {\text {E q u i t y} + \text {D e b t}}{\text {E q u i t y}} = 1 + \frac {\text {D e b t}}{\text {E q u i t y}}
$$

# Example 19.3 Margin versus Turnover

Consider two firms with the same ROA of  $10\%$  per year. The first is a discount chain; the second is a gas and electric utility.

As Table 19.8 shows, the discount chain has a "low" profit margin of  $2\%$  and achieves a  $10\%$  ROA by "turning over" its assets five times per year. The capital-intensive utility, in contrast, has a "low" asset turnover ratio of only .5 time per year and achieves its  $10\%$  ROA through its higher profit margin of  $20\%$ . We see that a "low" margin or asset turnover ratio need not indicate a troubled firm. Each ratio must be interpreted in light of industry norms.

# Turnover and Other Asset Utilization Ratios

To understand a firm's ratio of sales to assets, it is often helpful to compute comparable efficiency-of-utilization, or turnover, ratios for subcategories of assets. For example, we can think about turnover relative to fixed rather than total assets:

$$
\text {F i x e d - a s s e t t u r n o v e r} = \frac {\text {S a l e s}}{\text {F i x e d a s s e t s}}
$$

This ratio measures sales per dollar of the firm's investments in fixed assets.

To illustrate how you can compute this and other ratios from a firm's financial statements, consider Growth Industries, Inc. (GI). GI's historical income statement and opening and closing balance sheets for the years 2020-2023 appear in Table 19.9. (To work with round numbers in this example, we round corporate tax from the actual rate,  $21\%$ , to  $20\%$ .)

GI's total asset turnover in 2023 was .303 (calculated as annual sales divided by average of start- and end-of-year assets), which was below the industry average of .4. To understand better why GI underperformed, we can compute asset utilization ratios separately for fixed assets, inventories, and accounts receivable.

GI's sales in 2023 were 144 million. Its only fixed assets were plant and equipment, which were 216 million at the beginning of the year and \$2590.2 million at year's end. Average fixed assets for the year were, therefore, 237.6 million [(216 million + \$2590.2 million)/2]. GI's fixed-asset turnover for 2023 therefore was 144 million per year/237.6 million = .606 per year. In other words, for every dollar of fixed assets, there was $.606 in sales.

Notice that when a financial ratio includes one item from the income statement, which covers a period of time, and another from a balance sheet, which is a "snapshot" at a particular time, common practice is to take the average of the beginning- and end-of-year balance sheet figures. Thus, in computing the fixed-asset turnover ratio, we divide sales (from the income statement) by average fixed assets (from the balance sheet).

Comparable figures for the fixed-asset turnover ratio for 2021–2023 and the 2023 industry average are:

<table><tr><td>2021</td><td>2022</td><td>2023</td><td>2023 Industry Average</td></tr><tr><td>0.606</td><td>0.606</td><td>0.606</td><td>0.700</td></tr></table>

GI's fixed asset turnover has been stable over time and below the industry average.

Another widely followed turnover ratio is the inventory turnover ratio, which is the ratio of cost of goods sold per dollar of average inventory. (We use the cost of goods sold instead of sales revenue in the numerator to maintain consistency with inventory, which is valued at cost.) This ratio measures the speed with which inventory is turned over.

Table 19.9

Growth Industries, Inc., financial statements (\$ thousand)

In 2021, GI's cost of goods sold was  \$45 million, and its average inventory was\$ 82.5 million [(\$75 million + \$90 million)/2]. Its inventory turnover was, therefore, .545 per year (\$45 million/\$82.5 million). In 2022 and 2023, inventory turnover remained the same, which was below the industry average of .5 per year. In other words, GI was burdened with a higher level of inventories relative to production than its competitors. This higher investment in working capital in turn resulted in a higher level of assets per dollar of sales or profits and a lower ROA than its competitors.

Another aspect of efficiency surrounds management of accounts receivable, which is often measured by days sales in receivables, that is, the average level of accounts receivable expressed as a multiple of daily sales. It is computed as average accounts receivable/ sales × 365  and may be interpreted as the number of days' worth of sales tied up in accounts receivable. You can also think of it as the average lag between the date of sale and the date payment is received; therefore, it is also called the average collection period.

For GI in 2023, the average collection period was 100.4 days:

$$
[($36 million + $430.2 million)/2] / $144 million × 365 = 100.4 days
$$

The industry average was only 60 days. This statistic tells us that GI's average receivables per dollar of sales exceeds that of its competitors. Again, this implies a higher required investment in working capital and, ultimately, a lower ROA.

In summary, these ratios show us that GI's poor total asset turnover relative to the industry is in part caused by lower-than-average fixed-asset turnover and inventory turnover and higher-than-average days receivables. This suggests GI may have excess plant capacity as well as poor inventory and receivables management practices.

# Liquidity Ratios

Leverage is one measure of the safety of a firm's debt. Debt ratios compare the firm's indebtedness to various measures of its assets, and coverage ratios compare measures of earning power against the cash flow needed to satisfy debt obligations. But leverage is not the only determinant of financial prudence. You also want to know that a firm can lay its hands on cash either to pay its scheduled obligations or to meet unforeseen obligations. Liquidity is the ability to convert assets into cash at short notice. Liquidity is commonly measured using the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio.

1. Current ratio: Current assets/Current liabilities. This ratio measures the ability of the firm to pay off its current liabilities by liquidating its current assets (i.e., turning them into cash). It indicates the firm's ability to avoid insolvency in the short run. GI's current ratio in 2021, for example, was  $(60 + 30 + 90) / (36 + 87.4) = 1.46$ . In other years, it was

<table><tr><td>2021</td><td>2022</td><td>2023</td><td>2023 Industry Average</td></tr><tr><td>1.46</td><td>1.16</td><td>0.95</td><td>2.0</td></tr></table>

This represents an unfavorable time trend and poor standing relative to the industry. This troublesome pattern is not surprising given the working capital burden resulting from GI's subpar performance with respect to receivables and inventory management.

2. Quick ratio: (Cash + Marketable securities + Receivables)/Current liabilities. This ratio is also called the acid test ratio. It has the same denominator as the current ratio, but its numerator includes only cash, cash equivalents, and receivables. The quick ratio is a better measure of liquidity than the current ratio for firms whose inventory is not readily convertible into cash. GI's quick ratio shows the same disturbing trends as its current ratio:

<table><tr><td>2021</td><td>2022</td><td>2023</td><td>2023 Industry Average</td></tr><tr><td>0.73</td><td>0.58</td><td>0.48</td><td>1.0</td></tr></table>

3. Cash ratio. A company's receivables are less liquid than its holdings of cash and marketable securities. Therefore, in addition to the quick ratio, analysts also compute a firm's cash ratio, defined as

$$
\text {C a s h} = \frac {\text {C a s h} + \text {M a r k e t a b l e s e c u r i t i e s}}{\text {C u r r e n t} \text {l i a b i l i t i e s}}
$$

GI's cash ratios are

<table><tr><td>2021</td><td>2022</td><td>2023</td><td>2023 Industry Average</td></tr><tr><td>0.486</td><td>0.386</td><td>0.318</td><td>0.70</td></tr></table>

GI's liquidity ratios have fallen dramatically over this 3-year period, and by 2023, its liquidity measures are far below industry averages. The decline in the liquidity ratios combined with the decline in the coverage ratio (you can confirm that times interest earned has also fallen over this period) suggests that its credit rating has been declining as well, and, no doubt, GI is considered a relatively poor credit risk in 2023.

# Market Price Ratios: Growth versus Value

The market-book-value (P/B) ratio equals the market price of a share of the firm's common stock divided by its book value, that is, shareholders' equity per share. Some analysts consider the stock of a firm with a low market-book-value ratio to be a "safer" investment, seeing the book value as a "floor" supporting the market price. These analysts presumably view book value as the level below which market price will not fall because the firm always has the option to liquidate, or sell, its assets for their book values. However, this view is questionable. In fact, firms sometimes do sell below book value. For example, in 2022, shares in Citigroup, Honda, and Mitsubishi sold for less than book value. Nevertheless, a low market-book-value ratio is seen by some as providing a "margin of safety," and some analysts will screen out high-P/B firms in their stock selection process.

A better interpretation of the market-price-to-book-value ratio is as a measure of growth opportunities. Recall from the previous chapter that we may view the two components of firm value as assets in place and growth opportunities. As Example 19.4 illustrates, firms with greater growth opportunities will tend to exhibit higher multiples of market price to book value.

# Example 19.4 Market-Price-to-Book-Value Ratio and Growth Options

Consider two firms, both with book value per share of 10, both with a market capitalization rate of 15\%, and both with plowback ratios of .60.

Bright Prospects has an ROE of 20\%, which is well in excess of its market capitalization rate; this ROE implies that the firm is endowed with ample growth opportunities. With ROE = 0.20, Bright Prospects will earn \$2 per share this year. With its plowback ratio of .60, it pays out a dividend of D₁ = (1 - .6) × $2 = $0.80, has a growth rate of g = b \times ROE = .60 \times 0.20 = .12, and has a stock price of D_{1} / (k - g) = \80 / (.15 - .12) = \$26.67. Its price-book ratio is 26.67/10 = 2.667.

In contrast, Past Glory has an ROE of only 15\%, just equal to the market capitalization rate. It therefore will earn \$1.50 per share this year and will pay a dividend of D₁ = .4 × $1.50 = $.60. Its growth rate is g = b × ROE = .60 × .15 = .09, and its stock price is D₁/(k - g) = $.60/ (.15 - .09) = $10. Its price-book ratio is \$10/10 = 1.0. Not surprisingly, a firm that earns just the required rate of return on its investments will sell for book value, and no more.

We conclude that the market-price-to-book-value ratio is determined in large part by growth prospects.

Another measure used to place firms along a growth versus value spectrum is the price-earnings (P/E) ratio. In fact, we saw in the last chapter that the ratio of the present value of growth options to the value of assets in place largely determines the P/E multiple. While low-P/E stocks allow you to pay less per dollar of current earnings, the high-P/E stock may still be a better bargain if its earnings are expected to grow quickly enough.[6]

Remember, though, P/E ratios reported in the financial press are based on past earnings, while price is determined by the firm's prospects of future earnings. Therefore, reported P/E ratios may reflect variation in current earnings around a trend line.

Many analysts nevertheless believe that low-P/E stocks are more attractive than high-P/E stocks. And, in fact, low-P/E stocks have generally been positive-alpha investments using the CAPM as a return benchmark. But an efficient market adherent would discount this track record, arguing that such a simplistic rule could not really generate abnormal returns, and that the CAPM may not be a good benchmark for returns in this case.

In any event, the important points to keep in mind are that ownership of the stock conveys the right to future as well as current earnings and, therefore, that a high P/E ratio may best be interpreted as a signal that the market views the firm as enjoying attractive growth opportunities.

Before leaving the P/B and P/E ratios, it is worth pointing out an important relationship between them:

\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {R O E} = \frac {\text {E a r n i n g s}}{\text {B o o k v a l u e}} = \frac {\text {M a r k e t p r i c e}}{\text {B o o k v a l u e}} \div \frac {\text {M a r k e t p r i c e}}{\text {E a r n i n g s}} \tag {19.5} \\ = \mathrm {P} / \mathrm {B} \text {r a t i o} \div \mathrm {P} / \mathrm {E} \text {r a t i o} \\ \end{array}
$$

Rearranging these terms, we find that a firm's P/E ratio equals its price-to-book ratio divided by ROE:

$$
\frac {\mathrm {P}}{\mathrm {E}} = \frac {\mathrm {P} / \mathrm {B}}{\mathrm {R O E}}
$$

Thus, a company with a high P/B ratio can still have a relatively low P/E ratio if its ROE is sufficiently high.

Wall Street often distinguishes between "good firms" and "good investments." A good firm may be highly profitable, with a high ROE. But if its stock price is bid up to a level commensurate with this ROE, its P/B ratio will also be high, and the stock price may be a relatively large multiple of earnings, thus reducing its attractiveness as an investment. The high ROE of the firm does not by itself imply that the stock is a good investment. Conversely, troubled firms with low ROEs can be good investments if their prices are low enough.

Table 19.10 summarizes the ratios reviewed in this section.

# Choosing a Benchmark

We have discussed how to calculate the principal financial ratios. To evaluate the performance of a given firm, however, you need a benchmark to which you can compare its ratios. One obvious benchmark is the ratio for the same company in earlier years. For example, Figure 19.3 shows Target's return on assets, profit margin, and asset turnover ratios since 2008. You can see that the company has benefitted from a steady rise in its turnover ratio. In 2011-2013, however, the profit margin declined, leading to a drop in ROA. But after 2013, both profit margin and turnover increased in tandem, producing a dramatic increase in ROA.

It is also helpful to compare financial ratios to those of other firms in the same industry. Financial ratios for industries are published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Dun & Bradstreet (Industry Norms and Key Business Ratios), and the Risk Management Association, or RMA (Annual Statement Studies). A broad range of financial ratios is also easily accessible on the Web.

# 19.5 An Illustration of Financial Statement Analysis

In her 2023 annual report to the shareholders of Growth Industries, Inc., the president wrote: "2023 was another successful year for Growth Industries. As in 2022, sales, assets, and operating income all continued to grow at a rate of  $20\%$ ."

Is she right?

The president is certainly correct about the growth rate in sales, assets, and operating income. But GI's key ratios, presented in Table 19.12, contradict her first sentence: 2023 was not another successful year for GI—it appears to have been another miserable one.

ROE has been declining rapidly, from  $7.45\%$  in 2021 to  $0.61\%$  in 2023. A comparison of GI's 2023 ROE to the 2023 industry average of  $8.64\%$  makes the deteriorating time trend appear especially alarming. The low and falling market-to-book-value ratio and the falling price-earnings ratio indicate investors are less and less optimistic about the firm's future profitability.

The fact that ROA has not been declining, however, tells us that the source of the declining time trend in GI's ROE must be related to financial leverage. And we see that as GI's leverage ratio (column 5) climbed from 20.23 in 2021 to 3.03 in 2023, its interest-burden ratio (column 2) worsened, from .580 to .036, with the net result that the compound leverage factor fell from 10.292 to .109.

The rapid increase in short-term debt from year to year and the concurrent increase in interest expense (see Table 19.9) make it clear that to finance its  $20\%$  growth rate in sales, GI has incurred sizable amounts of short-term debt at high interest rates. The firm is paying rates of interest greater than the ROA it is earning on the investment financed with the new borrowing. As leverage has increased and GI's financial situation has become evermore precarious, the rate it pays on new borrowing has increased dramatically. Between 2021 and 2023, the interest rate paid on short-term debt has increased from  $10\%$  to  $20\%$ . (See lower panel of Table 19.9.)

GI's problems become clear when we examine its statement of cash flows in Table 19.13. The statement is derived from the income statement and balance sheet data in Table 19.9. GI's cash flow from operations is falling steadily, from  $12,600,000 in 2021 to$ 2,482 in 2023. The firm's investment in plant and equipment, by contrast, has increased greatly. Net plant and equipment (i.e., net of depreciation) rose from  $150,000,000 in 2020 to$ 259,200,000 in 2023 (see Table 19.9). This near doubling of capital assets makes the decrease in cash flow from operations all the more troubling.

# Table 19.13

Growth Industries, Inc., statement of cash flows (\$ thousand)

${}^{a}$  Gross investment equals increase in net plant and equipment plus depreciation.
bWe can conclude that no dividends are paid because stockholders' equity increases each year by the full amount of net income.
Issues of short-term debt = investment in plant & equipment plus increases in cash balances minus cash provided by operations.
dIncrease in cash matches the increase from the balance sheet.

The source of the difficulty is GI's enormous amount of short-term borrowing. In a sense, the company is being run as a pyramid scheme. It borrows more and more each year to maintain its  $20\%$  growth rate in assets and income. However, the new assets are not generating enough cash flow to support the extra interest burden of the debt, as the falling cash flow from operations indicates. Eventually, when the firm loses its ability to borrow further, its growth will be at an end.

At this point, GI stock might be an attractive investment. Table 19.12 shows that its market price is only  $5\%$  of its book value. GI is a likely candidate for a takeover by another firm that might replace its management and build shareholder value through a radical change in policy.

# 19.6 Comparability Problems

Financial statement analysis gives us a good amount of ammunition for evaluating a company's performance and future prospects. But comparing financial results of different companies is not so simple. There is more than one acceptable way to represent various items of revenue and expense according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This means two firms may have exactly the same economic income yet very different accounting incomes.

Interpreting a single firm's performance over time is even more complicated when inflation distorts the dollar measuring rod. Comparability problems are especially acute in this case because the impact of inflation on reported results often depends on the particular method the firm adopts to account for inventories and depreciation. Earnings and financial ratios must be adjusted to a uniform standard before comparing financial results across firms and over time. Other important potential sources of noncomparability include the capitalization of leases and other expenses, the treatment of pension costs, and allowances for reserves.

# Inventory Valuation

There are two commonly used ways to value inventories: LIFO (last-in, first-out) and FIFO (first-in, first-out). We can explain the difference using a numerical example.

Suppose Generic Products, Inc. (GPI), has a constant inventory of 1 million units of generic goods. The inventory turns over once per year, meaning the ratio of cost of goods sold to inventory is 1.

The LIFO system calls for valuing the million units used up during the year at the current cost of production, so that the last goods produced are considered the first ones to be sold. They are valued at today's cost. The FIFO system assumes that the units used up or sold are the ones that were added to inventory first, and goods sold are therefore valued at original cost. If the price of Generic goods has been constant, say at the level of  \$1, the book value of inventory and the cost of goods sold will be the same,\$ 1 million under both systems. But suppose the price of Generic goods rises by 10 cents per unit during the year as a result of general inflation. Under LIFO, the last goods produced are assumed to be sold at the current cost of \$1.10; the goods remaining are the previously produced goods, at a cost of only \$1.

Therefore, LIFO accounting would result in a cost of goods sold of  \$1.1 million, whereas the end-of-year balance sheet value of the 1 million units in inventory remains\$ 1 million. The balance sheet value of inventories is calculated as the cost of the goods still in inventory. You can see that although LIFO accounting accurately measures the cost of goods sold today, it understates the current value of the remaining inventory in an inflationary environment.

In contrast, under FIFO accounting, the cost of goods sold would be  \$1 million, and the end-of-year balance sheet value of the inventory would be\$ 1.1 million. The result is that the LIFO firm has both a lower reported profit and a lower balance sheet value of inventories (and therefore a lower estimate of total assets and book value of equity) than the FIFO firm. Therefore, profitability measures such as ROE, which equals the ratio of profits to book value of equity (both of which are underestimated), can be either higher or lower under LIFO than FIFO.

LIFO results in a more realistic estimate of economic earnings (i.e., real sustainable cash flow) because it uses up-to-date prices to evaluate the cost of goods sold. However, it induces balance sheet distortions when it values investment in inventories at original cost.

This practice results in an upward bias in ROE compared to an ideal economic measure: While economic earnings are more accurately measured using LIFO, the investment base on which return is earned is systematically undervalued, at least during periods of inflation.

# Depreciation

Another source of problems is the measurement of depreciation, which is a key factor in computing earnings. The accounting and economic measures of depreciation can differ markedly. According to the economic definition, depreciation is the amount the firm must reinvest to sustain its real productive capacity at the current level. The accounting measurement is quite different. Accounting depreciation is the portion of the original acquisition cost of an asset allocated in each period over an arbitrarily specified life of the asset. This is the figure reported in financial statements.

The United States actually allows two sets of depreciation treatments. For tax reporting, it currently allows the entire investment to be written off immediately, thus offering the firm a tax break equal to the corporate tax rate,  $21\%$ , times the investment. However, for reporting purposes, firms are more likely to depreciate an investment smoothly over some assumed lifetime, for example, using straight-line depreciation.

Assume, for example, that a firm buys machines with a useful economic life of 20 years at  \$100,000 apiece. In its financial statements, however, the firm depreciates the machines over 10 years using the straight-line method, for\$ 10,000 per year in depreciation. Thus, after 10 years a machine will be fully depreciated on the books, even though it remains a productive asset that will not need replacement for another 10 years.

In computing accounting earnings, this firm will overestimate depreciation in the first 10 years of the machine's economic life and underestimate it in the last 10 years. This will cause reported earnings to be understated compared with economic earnings in the first 10 years and overstated in the last 10 years.

Depreciation comparability problems add one more wrinkle. A firm can use different depreciation methods for tax purposes than for other reporting purposes. Most firms use accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes and straight-line depreciation in published financial statements. There also are differences across firms in their estimates of the depreciable life of plant, equipment, and other depreciable assets.

Another complication arises from inflation. Because conventional depreciation is based on historical costs rather than on the current replacement cost of assets, measured depreciation in periods of inflation is understated relative to replacement cost, and real economic income (sustainable cash flow) is correspondingly overstated.

For example, suppose Generic Products, Inc., has a machine with a 3-year useful life that originally cost  \$3 million. Annual straight-line depreciation is\$ 1 million, regardless of what happens to the replacement cost of the machine. Suppose inflation in the first year turns out to be 10\%. Then the true annual depreciation expense is \$1.1 million in current terms, whereas conventionally measured depreciation remains fixed at \$1 million per year. Accounting income overstates real economic income by $.1 million.

# Inflation and Interest Expense

Inflation has perhaps an even greater effect on the calculation of real interest expense. Nominal interest rates include an inflation premium that compensates the lender for inflation-induced erosion in the real value of principal. From the perspective of both lender and borrower, therefore, part of what is conventionally measured as interest expense should be treated more properly as repayment of principal.

# Example 19.5 Inflation and Real Income

Suppose Generic Products has debt outstanding with a face value of 10 million at an interest rate of 10\% per year. Interest expense as conventionally measured is 1 million per year. However, suppose inflation during the year is 6\%, so that the real interest rate is 4\%. Then .6 million of what appears as interest expense on the income statement is really an inflation premium, or compensation for the anticipated reduction in the real value of the \$10 million principal; only $.4 million is real interest expense. The $.6 million reduction in the purchasing power of the outstanding principal may be thought of as repayment of principal, rather than as an interest expense. Real income of the firm is, therefore, understated by .6 million.

Mismeasurement of real interest means inflation results in an underestimate of real income. The effects of inflation on the reported values of inventories and depreciation that we have discussed work in the opposite direction.

# Fair Value Accounting

Many major assets and liabilities are not traded in financial markets and do not have easily observable values. For example, we cannot simply look up the values of employee stock options, health care benefits for retired employees, or buildings and other real estate. While the true financial status of a firm may depend critically on these values, which can swing widely over time, common practice has been to simply value them at historic cost. Proponents of fair value accounting, also known as mark-to-market accounting, argue that financial statements give a truer picture of the firm when they better reflect the current market values of all assets and liabilities.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement No. 157 on fair value accounting places assets in one of three "buckets." Level 1 assets are traded in active markets and therefore should be valued at their market price. Level 2 assets are not actively traded, but their values still may be estimated using observable market data on similar assets. They can be "marked to a matrix" of comparable securities. Level 3 assets are hardest to value. Here it is difficult even to identify other assets that are similar enough to serve as benchmarks for their market values; one has to resort to pricing models to estimate their intrinsic values. Rather than mark to market, these values are often called "mark to model," although they are also disparagingly known as mark-to-make-believe, as the estimates are so prone to manipulation by creative use of model inputs. Since 2012, firms have been required to disclose more about the methods and assumptions used in their valuation models and to describe the sensitivity of their valuation estimates to changes in their methodology.

Critics of fair value accounting argue that it relies too heavily on estimates. Such estimates potentially introduce considerable noise in firms' accounts and can induce profit volatility as fluctuations in asset valuations are recognized. Even worse, subjective valuations may offer management a tempting tool to manipulate earnings or the apparent financial condition of the firm at opportune times. As just one example, Bergstresser,

As banks and other institutions holding mortgage-backed securities revalued their portfolios throughout 2008, their net worth fell along with the value of those securities. The losses on these securities were painful enough, but their further implications only increased the banks' woes. For example, banks are required to maintain adequate levels of capital relative to assets. If capital reserves decline, a bank may be forced to shrink until its remaining capital is once again adequate compared to its asset base. But such shrinkage may require the bank to cut back on its lending, which restricts its customers' access to credit. It may also require asset sales, and if many banks attempt to shrink their portfolios at once, waves of forced sales may put further pressure on prices, resulting in additional write-downs and reductions to capital in a self-feeding cycle. Critics of mark-to-market accounting therefore contend that it exacerbated the problems of an already reeling economy.

Advocates, however, argue that the critics confuse the message with the messenger. Mark-to-market accounting makes transparent losses that have already been incurred, but it does not cause those losses. Critics retort that when markets are faltering, market prices may be unreliable. If trading activity has largely broken down, and assets can be sold only at fire-sale prices, then those prices may no longer be indicative of fundamental value. Markets cannot be efficient if they are not even functioning. In the turmoil surrounding the defaulted mortgages weighing down bank portfolios, one of the early proposals of then—Treasury secretary Henry Paulson was for the government to buy bad assets at "hold to maturity" prices based on estimates of intrinsic value in a normally functioning market. In that spirit, FASB approved new guidelines in 2009 allowing valuation based on an estimate of the price that would prevail in an orderly market rather than the one that could be received in a forced liquidation.


Waiving write-down requirements may best be viewed as thinly veiled regulatory forbearance. Regulators know that losses have been incurred and that capital has been impaired. But by allowing firms to carry assets on their books at model rather than market prices, the unpleasant implications of that fact for capital adequacy may be politely ignored for a time. Even so, if the goal is to avoid forced sales in a distressed market, transparency may nevertheless be the best policy. Better to acknowledge losses and explicitly modify capital regulations to help institutions recover their footing in a difficult economy than to deal with losses by ignoring them. After all, why bother preparing financial statements if they are allowed to obscure the true condition of the firm?

Before abandoning fair value accounting, it would be prudent to consider the alternative. Traditional historic-cost accounting, which would allow firms to carry assets on the books at their original purchase price, has even less to recommend it. It would leave investors without an accurate sense of the condition of shaky institutions, and by the same token lessen the pressure on those firms to get their houses in order. Dealing with losses must surely require acknowledging them.

Desai, and Rauh find that firms make more aggressive assumptions about returns on defined benefit pension plans (which lowers the computed present value of pension obligations) during periods in which executives are actively exercising their stock options.

A contentious debate over the application of fair value accounting to troubled financial institutions erupted in 2008 when values of financial securities such as subprime mortgage pools and derivative contracts backed by these pools came into question as trading in these instruments dried up. Without well-functioning markets, estimating (much less observing) market values was, at best, difficult. For example, employees at Credit Suisse were convicted of intentionally overstating the value of thinly traded mortgage bonds to improve the apparent profitability of their trading activities.

Many observers feel that mark-to-market accounting exacerbated the financial meltdown by forcing banks to excessively write down asset values; others feel that a failure to mark would have been tantamount to willfully ignoring reality and abdicating the responsibility to redress problems at nearly or already insolvent banks. The nearby box discusses the debate.

# Quality of Earnings and Accounting Practices

Many firms make accounting choices that will present their financial statements in the best possible light. The different choices available to firms give rise to the comparability problems we have discussed. As a result, earnings statements for different companies may be more or less rosy presentations of true economic earnings—sustainable cash flow that can be paid to shareholders without impairing the firm's productive capacity. Analysts commonly evaluate the quality of earnings reported by a firm. This concept refers to the realism and conservatism of the earnings number, in other words, the extent to which we might expect the reported level of earnings to be sustained.


Examples of the types of factors that influence quality of earnings are:

- Allowance for bad debt. Most firms sell goods using trade credit and must make an allowance for bad debt. An unrealistically low allowance overestimates the payments the firm is likely to receive and therefore reduces the quality of reported earnings.
- Nonrecurring items. Some items that affect earnings should not be expected to recur regularly. These include asset sales, effects of accounting changes, effects of exchange rate movements, or unusual investment income. For example, in years with large stock market returns, some firms enjoy large capital gains on securities held. These contribute to that year's earnings but should not be expected to repeat regularly. Such gains would be considered a "low-quality" component of earnings. Similarly, investment gains in corporate pension plans generate large but one-off contributions to reported earnings.
- Earnings smoothing. In 2003, Freddie Mac was the subject of an accounting scandal when it was revealed that it had improperly reclassified mortgages held in its portfolio in an attempt to reduce its current earnings. Why would it take such actions? Because later, if earnings turned down, Freddie could "release" earnings by reversing these transactions, and thereby create the appearance of steady earnings growth. Indeed, almost until its sudden collapse in 2008, Freddie Mac's nickname on Wall Street was "Steady Freddie." Similarly, in 2021, Bank of America increased its quarterly earnings by about 20.2 billion by releasing reserves it had set aside during the COVID-19 pandemic.[8] This release accounted for nearly one-fourth of that quarter's earnings. There was nothing inappropriate about this action—the bank noted that it was a response to lessened fears of loan defaults as the economic outlook brightened from the depths of the pandemic. Nevertheless, this source of "earnings" is clearly not sustainable over the long term and therefore must be considered low quality.
- Revenue recognition. Under GAAP accounting, a firm is allowed to recognize a sale before it is paid. This is why firms have accounts receivable. But sometimes it can be hard to know when to recognize sales. For example, suppose a computer firm signs a contract to provide products and services over a 5-year period. Should the projected revenue be booked immediately or spread out over five years? A more extreme version of this problem is called "channel stuffing," in which firms "sell" large quantities of goods to customers but give them the right to later either refuse delivery or return the product. The revenue from the "sale" is booked now, but the likely returns are not recognized until they occur (in a future accounting period).

In 2019, Under Armour came under federal investigation for practices that suggested channel stuffing dating back to 2016. Through the latter part of 2016, the company had recorded 26 consecutive quarters of  $20\%$  sales growth. In an apparent attempt to continue that streak, it was accused of pressuring retailers to accept early shipments of its products and of redirecting goods that ordinarily would have been shipped to its own factory stores to discount chains instead so they could be booked as sales in that quarter. By pulling sales forward, the company was able to sustain its impressive growth streak, at least temporarily. But, in fact, those sales appeared to be "borrowed" against future ones, painting an inflated portrait of actual demand for its product and misleading investors about its future prospects. When the federal investigation of its accounting practices became public in November 2019, the share price suffered a 1-day decline of nearly  $19\%$ .


In a similar, but in this case allowable, vein, the online used-car dealer Carvana is able to immediately recognize gains on the loans it extends to its customers by selling those loans to investors rather than keeping them on the books. If the loans were retained, the gains would instead be recognized over time.

If you see accounts receivable increasing faster than sales, or becoming a larger percentage of total assets, beware of these practices. You should also pay attention to rapid growth in firms' reserves for returns, a possible signal of channel stuffing. In fact, Under Armour's reserves for returns increased dramatically in 2016 and 2017. Given the wide latitude firms have in how they recognize revenue, many analysts choose instead to concentrate on cash flow, which is far harder for a company to manipulate.

- Off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities. Suppose that one firm guarantees the outstanding debt of another firm, perhaps a firm in which it has an ownership stake. That obligation ought to be disclosed as a contingent liability because it may require payments down the road. But these obligations may not be reported as part of the firm's outstanding debt. Before its bankruptcy in 2001, Enron became notorious for this practice. Although it had guaranteed the debts of other companies, it failed to recognize these potential liabilities on its balance sheet. To the contrary, it obscured its exposure behind the veil of paper firms—its so-called special-purpose entities (SPEs).

You need to keep your eye on other off-balance sheet items as well. A good example is leasing. Airlines, for example, may show no aircraft on their balance sheets but have long-term leases that are virtually equivalent to debt-financed ownership. However, if the leases are treated as operating rather than capital leases, they may appear only as footnotes to the financial statements.

# International Accounting Conventions

The examples cited above illustrate some of the problems that analysts can encounter when attempting to interpret financial data. Even greater problems arise in the interpretation of the financial statements of foreign firms. This is because these firms do not follow GAAP guidelines. Accounting practices in various countries differ to greater or lesser extents from U.S. standards. Here are some of the major issues that you should be aware of when using the financial statements of foreign firms:

- Reserving practices. Some countries allow firms considerably more discretion in setting aside reserves for future contingencies than is typical in the United States. Because additions to reserves result in a charge against income, reported earnings are subject to managerial discretion.
- Depreciation. In the United States, firms typically maintain separate sets of accounts for tax and reporting purposes. For example, accelerated depreciation is typically used for tax purposes, whereas straight-line depreciation is used for reporting purposes. In contrast, most other countries do not allow dual sets of accounts, and most firms in foreign countries use accelerated depreciation to minimize taxes despite the fact that it results in lower reported earnings. This makes reported earnings of foreign firms lower than they would be if the firms were allowed to use the U.S. practice.
- Intangibles. Treatment of intangibles such as goodwill can vary widely. Are they amortized or expensed? If amortized, over what period? Such issues can have a large impact on reported profits.

The effect of different accounting practices can be substantial. Figure 19.4 compares P/E ratios in different countries as reported and restated on a common basis. While P/E multiples have changed considerably since this study was published, these results illustrate how different accounting rules can have a big impact on these ratios.

Some of the differences between U.S. and European accounting standards arise from different philosophies regarding regulating accounting practice. GAAP accounting in the U.S. is rules-based, with detailed, explicit, and lengthy rules governing almost any circumstance that can be anticipated. In contrast, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) used in the European Union as well as in about 100 other countries such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, India, and China, are principles-based, setting out general approaches for the preparation of financial statements. While IFRS rules are more flexible, firms must be prepared to demonstrate that their accounting choices are consistent with its underlying principles.

For some years, the SEC worked to bring U.S. accounting standards more in line with international rules. In 2007, the SEC began allowing foreign firms to issue securities in the U.S. if their financial statements were prepared using IFRS. Subsequently, it went even further when it proposed allowing large U.S. multinational firms to report earnings using IFRS rather than GAAP and announced that it hoped to eventually adopt IFRS more broadly. But after many years of protracted negotiations, it become clear by 2014 that the SEC's plan to move to IFRS had stalled. While the SEC and the IASB (International Accounting Standards Board) continue to collaborate on accounting rules, there is little immediate prospect for a single global accounting standard that will include the United States.

# 19.7 Value Investing: The Graham Technique

No presentation of fundamental security analysis would be complete without a discussion of the ideas of Benjamin Graham, the greatest of the investment "gurus." Until the evolution of modern portfolio theory in the latter half of the 20th century, Graham was the single most important thinker, writer, and teacher in the field of investment analysis. His influence on investment professionals, among them his now equally famous student Warren Buffet, remains very strong.


Graham's magnum opus is *Security Analysis*, written with Columbia Professor David Dodd in 1934. Its message is similar to the ideas presented in this chapter. Graham believed careful analysis of a firm's financial statements could turn up bargain stocks. Over the years, he developed many different rules for determining the most important financial ratios and the critical values for judging a stock to be undervalued. Through many editions, his book has been so influential and successful that widespread adoption of Graham's techniques has led to the elimination of the very bargains they are designed to identify.

In a 1976 seminar, Graham said:

I am no longer an advocate of elaborate techniques of security analysis in order to find superior value opportunities. This was a rewarding activity, say, forty years ago, when our textbook "Graham and Dodd" was first published; but the situation has changed a good deal since then. In the old days any well-trained security analyst could do a good professional job of selecting undervalued issues through detailed studies; but in the light of the enormous amount of research now being carried on, I doubt whether in most cases such extensive efforts will generate sufficiently superior selections to justify their cost. To that very limited extent I'm on the side of the "efficient market" school of thought now generally accepted by the professors.[9]

Nonetheless, in that same seminar, Graham suggested a simplified approach to identifying bargain stocks:

My first, more limited, technique confines itself to the purchase of common stocks at less than their working-capital value, or net current-asset value, giving no weight to the plant and other fixed assets, and deducting all liabilities in full from the current assets. We used this approach extensively in managing investment funds, and over a 30-odd-year period we must have earned an average of some 20 percent per year from this source. I consider it a foolproof method of systematic investment—once again, not on the basis of individual results but in terms of the expectable group income.

As cited by John Train in Money Masters (New York: Harper & Row, 1987).

1. The primary focus of the security analyst should be the firm's real economic earnings rather than its reported earnings. Accounting earnings as reported in financial statements can be a noisy estimate of economic earnings, although empirical studies reveal that reported earnings convey considerable information concerning a firm's prospects.
2. Firm profitability depends on both the efficiency with which it uses its assets (commonly measured by turnover ratios) as well as the profitability of sales (commonly measured by profit margins). Financing decisions also should be prudent, so analysts also take great interest in leverage ratios and liquidity ratios.
3. ROE is affected by the firm's financial leverage. An increase in the debt-to-equity ratio will raise its ROE if the interest rate on the debt is less than the firm's return on assets.
4. It is often helpful to decompose a firm's ROE ratio into the product of several accounting ratios and to analyze their separate behavior over time or across companies within an industry. A useful breakdown is

$$
\mathrm {R O E} = \frac {\text {N e t p r o f i t s}}{\text {P r e t a x p r o f i t s}} \times \frac {\text {P r e t a x p r o f i t s}}{\text {E B I T}} \times \frac {\text {E B I T}}{\text {S a l e s}} \times \frac {\text {S a l e s}}{\text {A s s e t s}} \times \frac {\text {A s s e t s}}{\text {E q u i t y}}
$$

5. Other accounting ratios that have a bearing on a firm's profitability and/or risk are fixed-asset turnover, inventory turnover, days sales in receivables, and the current, quick, and interest coverage ratios.
6. Two ratios that make use of the market price of the firm's common stock in addition to its financial statements are the ratios of market to book value and price to earnings. Analysts sometimes take low values for these ratios as a sign that the stock is underpriced. However, both ratios may be better interpreted as signals of growth prospects.
7. Good firms are not necessarily good investments. Stock market prices of successful firms may be bid up to levels that reflect that success. If so, the price of these firms relative to their earnings prospects may not constitute a bargain.
8. A major problem in the use of data obtained from a firm's financial statements is comparability. Firms have a great deal of latitude in how they compute various components of revenue and expense. Accounting earnings and financial ratios must be adjusted to a uniform standard before comparing financial results.
9. Comparability problems can be acute when inflation is high. Inflation can create distortions in accounting for inventories, depreciation, and interest expense.
10. Fair value or mark-to-market accounting requires that most assets be valued at current market value rather than historical cost. This policy is controversial because ascertaining true market value in many instances is difficult, and critics contend that financial statements are therefore unduly volatile. Advocates argue that financial statements should reflect the best estimate of current asset values.
11. International financial reporting standards have become progressively accepted throughout the world. They differ from traditional U.S. GAAP procedures in that they are principles-based rather than rules-based.

9. Recently, Galaxy Corporation lowered its allowance for doubtful accounts by reducing bad debt expense from  $2\%$  of sales to  $1\%$  of sales. Ignoring taxes, what are the immediate effects on  $(a)$  operating income and  $(b)$  operating cash flow?

Use the following case in answering Problems 10 through 12: Hatfield Industries is a large manufacturing conglomerate based in the United States with annual sales in excess of 300 million. Hatfield is currently under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for accounting irregularities and possible legal violations in the presentation of the company's financial statements. A due diligence team from the SEC has been sent to Hatfield's corporate headquarters for an audit. The SEC finds that:

- Management has been involved in ongoing negotiations with the local labor union. Labor officials are seeking increased wages and pension benefits, which Hatfield's management states is not possible at this time due to decreased profitability and a tight cash flow situation. Labor officials have accused Hatfield's management of manipulating the company's financial statements to justify not granting any wage concessions.
- Recently obtained equipment has been classified as operating leases, although, in the past, acquisitions of similar equipment were nearly always classified as capital leases. Capital leases for this type of equipment are the industry norm. The SEC wants Hatfield's management to provide justification for this apparent deviation from "normal" accounting practices.
- Inventory on Hatfield's books has been increasing in comparison to sales growth. Management credits the boost in overall production to improved operating efficiencies. The SEC wonders whether Hatfield may have manipulated its inventory accounts.

The SEC due diligence team is not necessarily searching for evidence of fraud but of possible manipulation of accounting standards to mislead shareholders and other interested parties. Initial review of Hatfield's financial statements indicates that, at a minimum, certain practices have resulted in low-quality earnings.

10. Labor officials believe that the management of Hatfield is attempting to understate its net income to avoid making any concessions in the labor negotiations. Which of the following actions by management will most likely result in low-quality earnings?

$a$ . Lengthening the life of a depreciable asset in order to lower the depreciation expense.
$b$ . Lowering the discount rate used to value pension obligations.
c. Recognizing revenue at the time of delivery rather than when payment is received.

11. Hatfield has begun recording all new equipment leases on its books as operating leases, a change from its consistent past use of capital leases, in which the present value of lease payments is recognized as a debt obligation. What is the most likely motivation behind Hatfield's change in accounting methodology? Hatfield is attempting to:

$a$ . Improve its leverage ratios and reduce its perceived leverage.
$b$ . Reduce its cost of goods sold and increase its profitability.
$c$ . Increase its operating margins relative to industry peers.

12. The SEC due diligence team is searching for the reason behind Hatfield's inventory build-up relative to its sales growth. One way to identify a deliberate manipulation of financial results by Hatfield is to search for: a. A decline in inventory turnover.

$b$ . Receivables that are growing faster than sales.
$c$ . A delay in the recognition of expenses.

4. Janet Ludlow is a recently hired analyst. After describing the electric toothbrush industry, her first report focuses on two companies, QuickBrush Company and SmileWhite Corporation, and concludes:

QuickBrush is a more profitable company than SmileWhite, as indicated by the  $40 \%$ sales growth and substantially higher margins it has produced over the last few years. SmileWhite’s sales and earnings are growing at a  $10 \%$ rate and produce much lower margins. We do not think SmileWhite is capable of growing faster than its recent growth rate of  $10 \%$ , whereas QuickBrush can sustain a  $30 \%$ long- term growth rate.

Table 19C

SmileWhite Corporation financial statements: yearly data (000 except per-share data) b. Explain how QuickBrush has produced an average annual earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of  $40\%$  over the last two years with an ROE that has been declining. Use only the information provided in Table 19B.


Use the following case in answering CFA Problems 5 through 8: Eastover Company (EO) is a large, diversified forest products company. Approximately  $75\%$  of its sales are from paper and forest products, with the remainder from financial services and real estate. The company owns 5.6 million acres of timberland, which is carried at very low historical cost on the balance sheet.

Peggy Mulroney, CFA, is an analyst at the investment counseling firm of Centurion Investments. She is assigned the task of assessing the outlook for Eastover, which is being considered for purchase, and comparing it to another forest products company in Centurion's portfolios, Southampton Corporation (SHC). SHC is a major producer of lumber products in the United States. Building products, primarily lumber and plywood, account for  $89\%$  of SHC's sales, with pulp accounting for the remainder. SHC owns 1.4 million acres of timberland, which is also carried at historical cost on the balance sheet. In SHC's case, however, that cost is not as far below current market as Eastover's.

Mulroney began her examination of Eastover and Southampton by looking at the five components of return on equity (ROE) for each company. For her analysis, Mulroney elected to define equity as total shareholders' equity, including preferred stock. She also elected to use year-end data rather than averages for the balance sheet items.

5. a. On the basis of the data shown in Tables 19D and 19E, calculate each of the five ROE components for Eastover and Southampton in 2023. Using the five components, calculate ROE for both companies.
b. Referring to the components calculated in part (a), explain the difference in ROE for Eastover and Southampton in 2023.
c. Using 2023 data, calculate the sustainable growth rate for both Eastover and Southampton. Discuss the appropriateness of using these calculations as a basis for estimating future growth.

6. a. Mulroney recalled from her CFA studies that the constant-growth discounted dividend model was one way to arrive at a valuation for a company's common stock. She collected current dividend and stock price data for Eastover and Southampton, shown in Table 19F. Using  $11\%$  as the required rate of return (i.e., discount rate) and a projected growth rate of  $8\%$ , compute a constant-growth DDM value for Eastover's stock and compare the computed value for Eastover to its stock price indicated in Table 19G.
b. Mulroney's supervisor commented that a two-stage DDM may be more appropriate for companies such as Eastover and Southampton. Mulroney believes that Eastover and Southampton could grow more rapidly over the next three years (i.e., 2025-2027) and then settle in at a lower but sustainable rate of growth beyond 2027. Her estimates are indicated in Table 19H. Using  $11\%$  as the required rate of return, compute the two-stage DDM value of Eastover's stock and compare that value to its stock price indicated in Table 19G.
c. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of using a constant-growth DDM. Briefly discuss how the two-stage DDM improves upon the constant-growth DDM.

7. In addition to the discounted dividend model approach, Mulroney decided to look at the price-earnings ratio and price-book ratio, relative to the S&P 500, for both Eastover and Southampton. Mulroney elected to perform this analysis using 2020–2024 and current data.

a. Using the data in Tables 19F and 19G, compute both the current and the 5-year (2020-2024) average relative price-earnings ratios and relative price-book ratios for Eastover and Southampton (i.e., ratios relative to those for the S&P 500). Discuss each company's current (2024) relative price-earnings ratio compared to its 5-year average relative price-earnings ratio and each company's current relative price-book ratio as compared to its 5-year average relative price-book ratio.
b. Briefly discuss one disadvantage for each of the relative price-earnings and relative price-book approaches to valuation.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. A debt-to-equity ratio of 1 implies that Mordett will have \$50 million of debt and \$50 million of equity. Interest expense will be .09 × \$50 million, or \$4.5 million per year. Mordett's net profits and ROE over the business cycle will therefore be

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Scenario</td><td rowspan="2">EBIT</td><td colspan="2">Nodett</td><td colspan="2">Mordett</td></tr><tr><td>Net Profits</td><td>ROE</td><td>Net Profits*</td><td>ROE†</td></tr><tr><td>Bad year</td><td>\$ 5 million</td><td>\$4 million</td><td>4\%</td><td>0.4 million</td><td>0.8\%</td></tr><tr><td>Normal year</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>8\%</td><td>4.4</td><td>8.8\%</td></tr><tr><td>Good year</td><td>15</td><td>12</td><td>12\%</td><td>8.4</td><td>16.8\%</td></tr></table>

*Mordett's after-tax profits are given by (1 – 0.2)(EBIT – 4.5 million).

* Mordett's equity is only \$50 million, so ROE = net profits/\$50 million.

3. GI's ROE in 2023 was  $0.61\%$ , computed as follows:

$$
\mathrm{ROE} = \frac{\mathbb{S}1,042}{.5(\mathbb{S}170,312 + \mathbb{S}171,354)} = .0061,\mathrm{or}.61\%
$$

Its P/E ratio was  $8.50 / \mathbb{S}1.042 = 8.16$  and its P/B ratio was  $\$ 8.50 / 171.354 = .05$ . Its earnings yield (the reciprocal of the P/E ratio) was  $120.25\%$ , compared with an industry average of  $8.3\%$ .

Note that in our calculations P/E does not precisely equal (P/B)/ROE because (following common practice) we have computed ROE with average shareholders' equity in the denominator and P/B with end-of-year shareholders' equity in the denominator.

ROE increased despite a decline in operating margin and a decline in the tax-burden ratio because of increased leverage and turnover. Note that ROA declined from  $11.65\%$  in 2022 to  $10.65\%$  in 2024.

5. LIFO accounting results in lower reported earnings than does FIFO. Fewer assets to depreciate result in lower reported earnings because there is less bias associated with the use of historic cost. More debt results in lower reported earnings because the inflation premium in the interest rate is treated as part of interest expense and not as repayment of principal. If ABC has the same reported earnings as XYZ despite these three sources of downward bias, its real earnings must be greater.
