# Futures Markets

# 22

FUTURES AND FORWARD contracts are like options in that they specify purchase or sale of some underlying security at some future date. The key difference is that the holder of an option is not compelled to buy or sell and will not do so unless the trade is advantageous. A futures or forward contract, however, carries the obligation to go through with the agreed-upon transaction.

A forward contract is not an investment in the strict sense that funds are paid for an asset. It is only a commitment today to transact in the future. Forward arrangements are part of our study of investments, however, because they offer powerful means to hedge other investments and modify portfolio characteristics.

Forward markets for future delivery of various commodities go back at least to ancient Greece. Organized futures markets, though, are a relatively modern development, dating only to the 19th century. Futures markets replace informal forward contracts with highly standardized, exchange-traded securities.


While futures markets have their roots in agricultural products and commodities, the markets today are dominated by trading in financial futures such as those on stock indexes, interest-rate-dependent securities such as government bonds, and foreign exchange. The markets themselves also have changed, with almost all trading today taking place in electronic markets.

This chapter describes the workings of futures markets and the mechanics of trading in these markets. We show how futures contracts are useful investment vehicles for both hedgers and speculators and how the futures price relates to the spot price of an asset. We also show how futures can be used in several risk-management applications. This chapter deals with general principles of futures markets. Chapter 23 describes specific futures markets in greater detail.

# 22.1 The Futures Contract

To see how futures and forwards work and how they might be useful, consider the portfolio diversification problem facing a farmer growing a single crop, let's say wheat. The entire planting season's revenue depends critically on the volatile crop price. The farmer can't easily diversify his position because virtually his entire wealth is tied up in the crop.

The miller who must purchase wheat for processing faces a risk management problem that is the mirror image of the farmer's. It is subject to profit uncertainty because of the unpredictable cost of the wheat.

Both parties can hedge their risk by entering into a forward contract calling for the farmer to deliver the wheat when harvested at a price agreed upon now, regardless of the market price at harvest time. No money changes hands at this time. A forward contract is simply a deferred-delivery sale of some asset at a stipulated price. The contract protects both the buyer and the seller from future price fluctuations.

Futures markets formalize and standardize forward contracting. Buyers and sellers trade in a centralized futures exchange. The exchange standardizes the types of contracts that may be traded: It establishes contract size, the acceptable grade of commodity, contract delivery dates, and so forth. Although standardization eliminates much of the flexibility available in forward contracting, it offers the offsetting advantage of liquidity because many traders will concentrate on the same small set of contracts. Futures contracts also differ from forward contracts in that they call for a daily settling up of any gains or losses on the contract. By contrast, no money changes hands in forward contracts until the delivery date.

The centralized market, standardization of contracts, and depth of trading in each contract allows futures positions to be liquidated easily rather than renegotiated with the other party to the contract. Because the exchange guarantees the performance of each party, costly credit checks on other traders are not necessary. Instead, each trader posts a good-faith deposit, called the margin, to guarantee contract performance.

# The Basics of Futures Contracts

The futures contract calls for delivery of a commodity at a specified delivery or maturity date, for an agreed-upon futures price, to be paid at contract maturity. The contract specifies precise requirements for the commodity. For agricultural commodities, the exchange sets allowable grades (e.g., No. 2 hard winter wheat or No. 1 soft red wheat). The place and means of delivery of the commodity are specified as well. Delivery of agricultural commodities is made by transfer of warehouse receipts issued by approved warehouses. For financial futures, delivery may be made by wire transfer; index futures use a cash settlement procedure similar to those used for index options. Although the futures contract technically calls for delivery of an asset, delivery rarely occurs. Instead, parties to the contract much more commonly close out their positions before contract maturity, taking gains or losses in cash.

Because the futures exchange specifies all the terms of the contract, the traders need bargain only over the futures price. The trader taking the long position commits to purchasing the commodity on the delivery date. The trader who takes the short position commits to delivering the commodity. The trader in the long position is said to "buy" a contract; the short-side trader "sells" a contract. The words buy and sell are figurative only because a contract is not really bought or sold like a stock or bond; it is entered into by mutual agreement. At the time the contract is entered into, no money changes hands.

Figure 22.1 shows prices for several futures contracts as they appear in The Wall Street Journal. The boldface heading lists in each case the commodity, the exchange where the futures contract is traded, the contract size, and the pricing unit. The first agricultural contract listed is for corn, traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBT). (The CBT merged with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 2007 but still maintains a separate identity.) Each contract calls for delivery of 5,000 bushels, and prices in the entry are quoted in cents per bushel.

The next rows detail price data for contracts expiring on various dates. The settlement price for the December 2021 corn contract (a representative trading price during the last few minutes of trading) was 541.50 cents per bushel, which was 4.75 cents higher than

Figure 22.1 Futures listings

Source: The Wall Street Journal, October 2, 2021 (prices for October 1, 2021).


The long position, that is, the trader who will purchase the good, profits from price increases. Suppose that when the contract matures, the price of corn turns out to be 546.50 cents per bushel. The long side, who entered the contract at the futures price of 541.50 cents, therefore earns a profit of 5 cents per bushel. As each contract calls for delivery of 5,000 bushels, the dollar profit equals  $5,000 \times .05 = \$ 250$ per contract. Conversely, the short position loses 5 cents per bushel. The short position's loss equals the long position's gain.

To summarize, at maturity:

Profit to long  $=$  Spot price at maturity - Original futures price

Profit to short  $=$  Original futures price - Spot price at maturity where the spot price is the actual market price of the commodity at the time of the delivery.


The futures contract, therefore, is a zero-sum game, with losses and gains netting out to zero. Every long position is offset by a short position. The aggregate profits to futures trading, summing over all investors, also must be zero, as is the net exposure to changes in the commodity price. For this reason, the establishment of a futures market in a commodity should not have a major impact on prices in the spot market for that commodity.

Figure 22.2, Panel A, is a plot of the long position's profits as a function of the asset price on the maturity date. Profit is zero when the ultimate spot price,  $P_{T}$ , equals the initial futures price,  $F_{0}$ . Profit per unit of the underlying asset price rises or falls one-for-one with changes in the final spot price. Unlike the payoff of a call option, the payoff of the long futures position can be negative: This will be the case if the spot price falls below the original futures price. Unlike the holder of a call, who has an option to buy, the long futures trader cannot simply walk away from the contract. Also unlike options, there is no need to distinguish gross futures payoffs from net profits. This is because the futures contract is not purchased; it is simply a contract. The futures price adjusts to make the present value of entering into a new contract equal to zero.

The distinction between futures and options is highlighted by comparing Panel A of Figure 22.2 to the payoff and profit diagrams for an investor in a call option with exercise price  $X$ , chosen equal to the futures price  $F_{0}$  (see Panel C). The futures investor is exposed to considerable losses if the asset price falls significantly. In contrast, the investor in the call cannot lose more than the cost of the option.

# Existing Contracts

Futures and forward contracts are traded on a wide variety of goods in four broad categories: agricultural commodities, metals and minerals (including energy commodities), foreign currencies, and financial futures (fixed-income securities and stock market indexes).

Table 22.1 offers a sample of the various contracts trading in 2022. While the table includes many contracts, the large and ever-changing array of markets makes this list

Sample of futures contracts

If you find S&P 500 or T-bond contracts a bit dry, perhaps you'd be interested in futures contracts with payoffs that depend on the winner of the next presidential election, or the severity of the next influenza season, or the host city of the 2036 Olympics. You can now find "futures markets" in these events and many others.

For example, both Iowa Electronic Markets (www.biz.uowa.edu/iem) and the Politics page of BetFair (www.betfair.com) maintain presidential futures markets. In January 2020, you could have purchased a contract that would pay off  $1 if Bernie Sanders had won the Democratic primary but nothing if he lost. The contract price (expressed as a percentage of face value) therefore may be viewed as the probability of a Sanders victory, at least according to the consensus view of market participants at the time. If you believed that the probability of a Sanders victory was 40\%$ , you would have been prepared to pay up to .40 for the contract. Alternatively, if you had wished to bet against him, you could have sold the contract. Similarly, you could have bet on (or against) a victory by any of the other candidates, for contracts traded on each of them.


The accompanying figure shows the contract price for most of the major candidates in early 2020. The price clearly tracks their perceived prospects. You can see Biden's price start above  $\ .80$  but fall dramatically as his early debate performance was heavily criticized. But Biden's decisive victory on Super Tuesday (March 3) shows up in his rocketing price as well as the deep dive in the prices of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. By mid-March, with all the other candidates either out of the race or widely expected to drop out, Biden's price had increased to about  $\$  .90 .

Interpreting prediction market prices as probabilities actually requires a caveat. Because the contract payoff is risky, the price of the contract may reflect a risk premium. Therefore, to be precise, these probabilities are actually risk-neutral probabilities (see Chapter 21). In practice, however, it seems unlikely that the risk premium associated with these contracts is substantial.

Outside the futures markets, a well-developed network of banks and brokers has established a forward market in foreign exchange. This forward market is not a formal exchange in the sense that the exchange specifies the terms of the traded contract. Instead, participants in this over-the-counter market may negotiate for delivery of any quantity of goods at any date, whereas in the formal futures markets contract size and delivery dates are set by the exchange. In forward arrangements, banks and brokers simply negotiate contracts for clients (or themselves) as needed. This market is huge. In London alone, the largest currency market, more than  $3 trillion of currency trades each day. An additional$ 1.5 trillion trades on a typical day in New York.

# 22.2 Trading Mechanics

# The Clearinghouse and Open Interest

Until about 25 years ago, most futures trades in the United States occurred among floor traders in the "trading pit" for each contract. Today, however, trading is overwhelmingly conducted through electronic networks.

Once a trade is agreed to, the clearinghouse enters the picture. Rather than having the long and short traders hold contracts with each other, the clearinghouse becomes the seller of the contract for the long position and the buyer of the contract for the short position. The clearinghouse delivers the commodity to the long position and pays for delivery from the short; consequently, its position nets to zero. This arrangement makes the clearinghouse the trading partner of each trader, both long and short. The clearinghouse, bound to perform on its side of each contract, is the only party that can be hurt by the failure of any trader to satisfy the obligations of the contract. This arrangement is necessary because a futures contract calls for future performance, which cannot be as easily guaranteed as an immediate stock transaction.

Figure 22.3, Panel A, shows what would happen in the absence of the clearinghouse. The long position would be obligated to pay the futures price to the short position, and the short position would be obligated to deliver the commodity. Panel B shows how the clear inghouse becomes an intermediary, acting as the trading partner for each side of the contract. The clearinghouse's position is neutral, as it takes a long and a short position for each transaction.


The clearinghouse makes it possible for traders to liquidate positions easily. If you are currently long and want to undo your position, you simply instruct your broker to enter the short side of a contract. This is called a reversing trade. The exchange nets out your long and short positions, reducing your net position to zero. Your zero net position eliminates the need to fulfill at maturity either the original long or reversing short position.

Open interest is the number of contracts outstanding. (Long and short positions are not counted separately, meaning that open interest can be defined either as the number of long or short contracts outstanding. The clearinghouse's position nets out to zero, and so is not counted in the computation of open interest.) When contracts begin trading, open interest is zero. As time passes, open interest increases as progressively more contracts are entered.

There are many apocryphal stories about futures traders who wake up to discover a small mountain of wheat or corn on their front lawn. But the truth is that futures contracts rarely result in actual delivery of the underlying asset. Traders establish long or short positions in contracts that will benefit from a rise or fall in the futures price but almost always close out, or reverse, those positions before the contract expires. The fraction of contracts that result in actual delivery is estimated to range from less than  $1\%$  to  $3\%$ , depending on the commodity and activity in the contract. In the unusual case of actual deliveries of commodities, they occur via regular channels of supply, most often warehouse receipts.

You can see the typical pattern of open interest in Figure 22.1. In the silver contract, for example, the October contract is approaching maturity, and open interest is small; most contracts have been reversed already. The greatest open interest is in the December contract. For other contracts, for example, crude oil, for which the nearest maturity date isn't until November, open interest is highest in the nearest contract.

# The Margin Account and Marking to Market

The total profit or loss realized by the long trader who buys a contract at time 0 and closes, or reverses, it at time  $t$  is just the change in the futures price over the period,  $F_{t} - F_{0}$ . Symmetrically, the short trader earns  $F_{0} - F_{t}$ .

The process by which profits or losses accrue to traders is called marking to market. At initial execution of a trade, each trader establishes a margin account. The margin is a security account consisting of cash or near-cash securities, such as Treasury bills, that ensures the trader is able to satisfy the obligations of the futures contract. Because both parties to a contract are exposed to losses, both must post margin. To illustrate, return to the first corn contract listed in Figure 22.1. If the initial required margin on corn, for example, is  $10\%$ , then each trader must put up \ $2,707.50 per contract. This is 10\%$  of the value of the contract, \5.415 per bushel × 5,000 bushels per contract.

Because the initial margin may be satisfied by posting interest-earning securities, the requirement does not impose a significant opportunity cost of funds on the trader. The initial margin is usually set between  $5\%$  and  $15\%$  of the total value of the contract. Contracts written on assets with more volatile prices require higher margins.

On any day that futures contracts trade, futures prices may rise or fall. Instead of waiting until the maturity date for traders to realize all gains and losses, the clearinghouse requires all positions to recognize profits as they accrue. If the futures price of corn rises from  $5.415 to$ 5.435 per bushel, the clearinghouse credits the margin account of the long position for 5,000 bushels times 2 cents per bushel, or 100 per contract. Conversely, the clearinghouse takes this amount from the margin account of the short position for each contract held.

This daily settling is called **marking to market**. It means the maturity date of the contract does not govern realization of profit or loss. Instead, as futures prices change, the proceeds accrue to the trader's margin account immediately. Here is an example to illustrate the procedure.

# Example 22.1 Marking to Market

Assume the 5-day maturity futures price for silver is currently 20.10 per ounce. Suppose that over the next 5 days, the futures price evolves as follows:

<table><tr><td>Day</td><td>Futures Price</td></tr><tr><td>0 (today)</td><td>20.10</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>20.20</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>20.25</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>20.18</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>20.18</td></tr><tr><td>5 (maturity)</td><td>20.21</td></tr></table>

The daily mark-to-market settlements for each contract held by the long position will be as follows:

<table><tr><td>Day</td><td colspan="2">Profit (Loss) per Ounce × 5,000 Ounces/Contract = Daily Proceeds</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>20.20 – 20.10 = 0.10</td><td>$500</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>20.25 – 20.20 = 0.05</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>20.18 – 20.25 = -0.07</td><td>-350</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>20.18 – 20.18 = 0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>20.21 – 20.18 = 0.03</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Sum = $550</td></tr></table>

The profit on Day 1 is the increase in the futures price from the previous day, or ($20.20 – $20.10) per ounce. Because each silver contract on the Commodity Exchange (CMX) calls for purchase and delivery of 5,000 ounces, the total profit per contract is 5,000 times $.10, or $500. On Day 3, when the futures price falls, the long position's margin account will be debited by $350. By Day 5, the sum of all daily proceeds is $550. This is exactly equal to 5,000 times the difference between the final futures price of $20.21 and the original futures price of $20.10.

Marking to market is the major way in which futures and forward contracts differ, besides contract standardization. Futures follow this pay-(or receive-)as-you-go method. Forward contracts are simply held until maturity, and no funds are transferred until that date.

# Concept Check 22.2

What must be the net inflow or outlay from marking to market for the clearinghouse?

If a trader accrues sustained losses from daily marking to market, the margin account may fall below a critical value called the maintenance margin. If the maintenance margin is breached, the trader receives a margin call, requiring that the margin account be replenished or the position be reduced to a size commensurate with the remaining funds. Margins and margin calls safeguard the position of the clearinghouse. Positions are closed out before the margin account is exhausted—the trader's losses are covered, and the clearinghouse is not put at risk.

# Example 22.2 Maintenance Margin

Suppose the maintenance margin is  $5 \%$ while the initial margin was  $10 \%$ of the value of the corn, or  $\$ 2,707.50$ . Then a margin call will go out when the original margin account has fallen in half, by about  $\$ 1,354$ . Each 1- cent decline in the corn price results in a  $\$ 50$ loss to the long position. Therefore, the futures price need only fall by just over 27 cents (or  $5 \%$ of its current value) to trigger a margin call.

# The Convergence Property

On the contract maturity date, the futures price will equal the spot price of the commodity. As a maturing contract calls for immediate delivery, the futures price on that day must equal the spot price—the cost of the commodity from the two competing sources is equalized in a competitive market. You may obtain delivery of the commodity either by purchasing it directly in the spot market or by entering the long side of a futures contract.

A commodity available from two sources (spot or futures market) must be priced identically, or else investors will rush to purchase it from the cheap source in order to sell it in the high-priced market. Such arbitrage activity could not persist without prices adjusting to eliminate the arbitrage opportunity. Therefore, the futures price and the spot price must converge at maturity. This is called the convergence property.

For an investor who establishes a long position in a contract now (time 0) and holds that position until maturity (time  $T$ ), the sum of all daily settlements will equal  $F_{T} - F_{0}$ , where  $F_{T}$  denotes the futures price at contract maturity. Because of convergence, however, the futures price at maturity,  $F_{T}$ , equals the spot price,  $P_{T}$ , so total futures profits also may be expressed as  $P_{T} - F_{0}$ . Thus, we see that profits on a futures contract held to maturity perfectly track changes in the value of the underlying asset. Moreover, the total profit on a futures contract held until maturity is the same as that on a forward contract calling for the long trader to pay  $F_{0}$  for an asset that ultimately will be worth  $P_{T}$ . For this reason, futures and forwards are often treated as nearly interchangeable.

# Cash versus Actual Delivery

Most futures contracts call for delivery of an actual commodity such as a particular grade of wheat or a specified amount of foreign currency if the contract is not reversed before maturity. For agricultural commodities, where quality of the delivered good may vary, the exchange sets quality standards as part of the futures contract. In some cases, contracts may be settled with higher- or lower-grade commodities. In these cases, a premium or discount is applied to the delivered commodity to adjust for the quality difference.

Some futures contracts call for cash settlement. An example is a stock index futures contract where the underlying asset is an index such as the Standard & Poor's 500. Delivery of every stock in the index clearly would be impractical. Hence, the contract calls for "delivery" of a cash amount equal to the value that the index attains on the maturity date of the contract. The sum of all the daily settlements from marking to market results in the long position realizing total profits or losses of  $S_{T} - F_{0}$ , where  $S_{T}$  is the value of the stock index on the maturity date  $T$  and  $F_{0}$  is the original futures price. Cash settlement closely mimics actual delivery, except the cash value of the asset rather than the asset itself is delivered.

More concretely, the widely traded E-mini S&P 500 index contract calls for delivery of  $50 times the value of the index. Suppose that at maturity, the S&P 500 is at a level of 4,000. Instead of delivering shares of all 500 stocks included in the index, cash settlement would require the short trader to deliver$ 50 × 4,000, or $200,000. This provides the trader exactly the same profit as would result from directly purchasing 50 units of the index for $200,000 and then delivering it for 50 times the original futures price.

# Regulations

Futures markets are regulated by the federal Commodities Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC sets capital requirements for member firms of the futures exchanges, authorizes trading in new contracts, and oversees maintenance of daily trading records.

The futures exchange may set limits on the amount by which futures prices may change from one day to the next. For example, if the price limit on silver contracts were set at  $1 and silver futures close today at$ 22.10 per ounce, then trades in silver tomorrow may vary only between  $21.10 and$ 23.10 per ounce. The exchanges may increase or reduce price limits in response to perceived changes in the price volatility of the underlying asset. Price limits are often eliminated as contracts approach maturity, usually in the last month of trading.

Price limits traditionally are viewed as a means to limit violent price fluctuations. This reasoning seems dubious, however. Suppose an international monetary crisis overnight drives up the spot price of silver to  $30. No one would sell silver futures at prices for future delivery as low as$ 22.10. Instead, the futures price would rise each day by the $1 limit, although the quoted price would represent only an unfilled bid order—no contracts would trade at the low quoted price. After several days of limit moves of $1 per day, the futures price would finally reach its equilibrium level, and trading would resume. This process means no one could unload a position until the price reached its equilibrium level. We conclude that price limits offer no real protection against fluctuations in equilibrium prices.

# Taxation

Because of the mark-to-market procedure, investors do not have control over the tax year in which they realize gains or losses. Instead, price changes are realized gradually, with each daily settlement. Therefore, taxes are paid at year-end on cumulated profits or losses, regardless of whether the position has been closed out. As a general rule,  $60\%$  of futures gains or losses are treated as long-term capital gains, and  $40\%$  are treated as short term.

# 22.3 Futures Markets Strategies

# Hedging and Speculation

Hedging and speculating are two polar uses of futures markets. A curator uses a futures contract to profit from movements in futures prices, a hedger to protect against price movement. A curator who believes prices will increase will take a long position for expected profits. Conversely, expected price declines call for a short position.

# Example 22.3 Speculating with Oil Futures

Suppose you believe that crude oil prices are going to increase and therefore decide to purchase crude oil futures. Each contract calls for delivery of 1,000 barrels of oil, so for every  $1 increase in the futures price of crude, the long position gains$ 1,000 and the short position loses that amount.

Conversely, suppose you think that prices are heading lower and therefore sell a contract. If crude oil prices do in fact fall, then you will gain  $1,000 per contract for every$ 1 that prices decline.

If the futures price for delivery in February is $72 and crude oil is selling at the contract maturity date for $73, the long side will profit by $1,000 per contract purchased. The short side will lose an identical amount on each contract sold. On the other hand, if oil has fallen to $71, the long side will lose, and the short side will gain, 1,000 per contract.

Why does a speculator buy a futures contract? Why not buy the underlying asset directly? One reason lies in transaction costs, which are far smaller in futures markets.

Another important reason is the leverage that futures trading provides. Recall that futures contracts require traders to post considerably less margin than the value of the asset underlying the contract. Therefore, they allow speculators to achieve much greater leverage than is available from direct trading in a commodity.

# Example 22.4 Futures and Leverage

Suppose the initial margin requirement for the oil contract is 10\%. At a current futures price of \72, and contract size of 1,000 barrels, this would require margin of. 10 \times 72 \times 1,000 = \7,200. A \1 increase in oil prices represents an increase of 1.39\%, and results in a \1,000 gain on the contract for the long position. This is a percentage gain of 13.9\% on the \7,200 posted as margin, precisely 10 times the percentage increase in the oil price. The 10-to-1 ratio of percentage changes reflects the leverage inherent in the futures position because the contract was established with an initial margin of one-tenth the value of the underlying asset.

Hedgers, by contrast, use futures to insulate themselves against price movements. A firm planning to sell oil, for example, might anticipate a period of market volatility and wish to protect its revenue against price fluctuations. To hedge the total revenue derived from the sale, the firm enters a short position in oil futures. As the following example illustrates, this locks in its total proceeds (i.e., revenue from the sale of the oil plus proceeds from its futures position).

# Example 22.5 Hedging with Oil Futures

Consider an oil distributor planning to sell 100,000 barrels of oil in February that wishes to hedge against a possible decline in oil prices. Because each contract calls for delivery of 1,000 barrels, it would sell 100 contracts that mature in February. Any decrease in prices would then generate a profit on the contracts that would offset the lower sales revenue from the oil.

To illustrate, suppose that the only three possible prices for oil in February are  $71,$ 72, and 73 per barrel. The revenue from the oil sale will be 100,000 times the price per barrel.

The profit on each contract sold will be 1,000 times any decline in the futures price. At maturity, the convergence property ensures that the final futures price will equal the spot price of oil. Therefore, the profit on the 100 contracts sold will equal  $100,000 \times (F_0 - P_T)$ , where  $P_T$  is the oil price on the delivery date and  $F_0$  is the original futures price, 72.

Now consider the firm's overall position. The total revenue in February can be computed as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="3">Oil Price in February, PT</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$71</td><td>$72</td><td>$73</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue from oil sale: 100,000 × PT</td><td>$7,100,000</td><td>$7,200,000</td><td>$7,300,000</td></tr><tr><td>+ Profit on futures: 100,000 × (F0 - PT)</td><td>100,000</td><td>0</td><td>-100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total proceeds</td><td>$7,200,000</td><td>$7,200,000</td><td>7,200,000</td></tr></table>

The revenue from the oil sale plus the proceeds from the contracts equals the current futures price, $72 per barrel. The variation in the price of the oil is precisely offset by the profits or losses on the futures position. For example, if oil falls to $71 a barrel, the short futures position generates $100,000 profit, just enough to bring total revenues to $7,200,000. The total is the same as if one were to arrange today to sell the oil in February at the futures price.

Figure 22.4 illustrates the nature of the hedge in Example 22.5. The upward-sloping line is the revenue from the sale of oil. The downward-sloping line is the profit on the futures contract. The horizontal line is the sum of sales revenue plus futures profits. This line is flat, as the hedged position is independent of oil prices.

Figure 22.4 Hedging revenues using futures, Example 22.5 (Futures price = 72 per barrel)

To generalize Example 22.5, note that oil will sell for  $P_T$  per barrel at the maturity of the contract. The profit per barrel on the futures will be  $F_0 - P_T$ . Therefore, total revenue is  $P_T + (F_0 - P_T) = F_0$ , which is independent of the eventual oil price.

The oil distributor in Example 22.5 engaged in a short hedge, entering a short futures position to offset risk in the sales price of a particular asset. A long hedge is the analogous hedge for someone who wishes to eliminate the risk of an uncertain purchase price. For example, a petrochemical processor planning to purchase oil may be afraid that prices might rise by the time of the purchase. As Concept Check 22.3 illustrates, the firm might buy oil futures to lock in the net purchase price at the time of the transaction.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/7dc6026888b5dc3cbb86ba0194094be3f5c3be9670f010157fd5f08401137d0b.jpg)

# Concept Check 22.3

As in Example 22.5, suppose that oil will be selling in February for 71, 72, or 73 per barrel. Consider a firm that plans to buy 100,000 barrels of oil in February. Show that if the firm buys 100 oil contracts today, its net expenditures in February will be hedged and equal to 7,200,000.

Exact futures hedging may be impossible for some goods because the necessary futures contract is not traded. For example, a portfolio manager might want to hedge the value of a diversified, actively managed portfolio for a period of time. However, futures contracts are listed only on indexed portfolios. Nevertheless, because returns on the manager's diversified portfolio will have a high correlation with returns on broad-based indexed portfolios, an effective hedge may be established by selling index futures contracts. Hedging a position using futures on another asset is called cross-hedging.

# Concept Check 22.4

What are the sources of risk to an investor who uses stock index futures to hedge an actively managed stock portfolio? How might you estimate the magnitude of that risk?

# Basis Risk and Hedging

The basis equals the spot price minus the futures price. As we have noted, on the maturity date of a contract, the basis must be zero: The convergence property implies that  $F_{T} = P_{T}$ . Before maturity, however, the futures price for later delivery may differ from the current spot price.

In Example 22.5, we discussed the case of a short hedger who manages risk by entering a short position to deliver oil in the future. If the asset and futures contract are held until maturity, the hedger bears no risk because the futures price and spot price at contract maturity must be equal: Gains and losses on the futures and the commodity position will exactly cancel. However, before maturity, the hedger bears basis risk because the futures price and spot price may not move in perfect lockstep.

Some speculators try to profit from movements in the basis. Rather than betting on the direction of the futures or spot prices per se, they bet on the changes in the difference between the two. A long spot–short futures position will profit when the basis narrows.

# Example 22.6 Speculating on the Basis

Consider an investor holding 100 ounces of gold, who is short one gold-futures contract. Suppose that gold today sells for $1,691 an ounce, and the futures price for June delivery is $1,696 an ounce. Therefore, the basis is currently -$5. Tomorrow, the spot price might increase to $1,695, while the futures price increases to $1,699, so the basis narrows to -$4. The investor's gains and losses are as follows:

Gain on holdings of gold (per ounce):  $1,695 -$ 1,691 = 4
Loss on gold futures position (per ounce):  $1,699 -$ 1,696 = 3

The net gain equals the narrowing of the basis, or 1 per ounce.

A related strategy is a calendar spread position, where the investor takes a long position in a futures contract of one maturity and a short position in a contract on the same commodity, but with a different maturity. Profits accrue if the difference in futures prices between the two contracts changes in the hoped-for direction, that is, if the futures price on the contract held long increases by more (or decreases by less) than the futures price on the contract held short.

# Example 22.7 Speculating on the Spread

Consider an investor who holds a September maturity contract long and a June contract short. If the September futures price increases by 5 cents while the June futures price increases by 4 cents, the net gain will be 5 cents - 4 cents, or 1 cent. Like basis strategies, spread positions aim to exploit movements in relative price structures rather than profit from movements in the general level of prices.

# 22.4 Futures Prices

# The Spot-Futures Parity Theorem

We have seen that a futures contract can be used to hedge changes in the value of the underlying asset. If the hedge is perfect, meaning that the asset-plus-futures portfolio has no risk, then the hedged position must provide a rate of return equal to the rate on other risk-free investments. Otherwise, there will be arbitrage opportunities that investors will exploit until prices are brought back into line. This insight allows us to derive the theoretical relationship between a futures price and the price of its underlying asset.

Suppose for simplicity that a stock market index such as the S&P 500 currently is at 1,000 and an investor who holds  $1,000 in an indexed mutual fund wishes to temporarily hedge exposure to market risk. Assume that the indexed portfolio pays year-end dividends of$ 20. Finally, assume that the futures price for year-end delivery of the index is 1,010.4 Let's examine the end-of-year proceeds for various values of the stock index if the investor hedges the portfolio by entering the short side of the futures contract.

<table><tr><td>Final value of stock portfolio, ST</td><td>$ 970</td><td>$ 990</td><td>$1,010</td><td>$1,030</td><td>$1,050</td><td>$1,070</td></tr><tr><td>Payoff from short futures position(equals F0 - FT = $1,010 - ST)</td><td>40</td><td>20</td><td>0</td><td>-20</td><td>-40</td><td>-60</td></tr><tr><td>Dividend income</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>$1,030</td><td>$1,030</td><td>$1,030</td><td>$1,030</td><td>$1,030</td><td>1,030</td></tr></table>

The payoff from the short futures position equals the difference between the original futures price, 1,010, and the year-end stock price. This is because of convergence: The futures price at contract maturity will equal the stock price at that time.

The overall position is perfectly hedged. Any increase in the value of the indexed stock portfolio is offset by an equal decrease in the payoff of the short futures position, resulting in a final value that is independent of the stock price. The 1,030 total payoff is the sum of the current futures price, F_{0} = 1,010, and the 20 dividend. It is as though the investor arranged to sell the stock at year-end for the current futures price, thereby eliminating price risk and locking in total proceeds equal to the futures price plus dividends.

What rate of return is earned on this riskless position? The stock investment requires an initial outlay of  $1,000, whereas the futures position is established without an initial cash outflow. Therefore, the$ 1,000 portfolio grows to a year-end value of 1,030, providing a rate of return of 3\%. More generally, a total investment of S0, the current stock price, grows to a final value of F0 + D, where D is the dividend payout on the portfolio. The rate of return is therefore

$$
\text {R a t e} = \frac {(F _ {0} + D) - S _ {0}}{S _ {0}}
$$

This return is essentially riskless. We observe  $F_{0}$  at the beginning of the period when we enter the futures contract. While dividend payouts are not perfectly riskless, they are highly predictable over short periods, especially for diversified portfolios. Any uncertainty is extremely small compared to the uncertainty in stock prices.

Presumably,  $3\%$  must be the rate of return available on other riskless investments. If not, then investors would face two competing risk-free strategies with different rates of return, a situation that could not last. Therefore, we conclude that

$$
\frac {(F _ {0} + D) - S _ {0}}{S _ {0}} = r _ {f}
$$

Rearranging, we find that the futures price must be

$$
F _ {0} = S _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f}\right) - D = S _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f} - d\right) \tag {22.1}
$$ where  $d$  is the dividend yield on the indexed stock portfolio, defined as  $D / S_0$ . This result is called the spot-futures parity theorem. It gives the normal or theoretically correct relationship between spot and futures prices. Here is an example.


# Example 22.8 Spot-Futures Parity

Suppose the S&P 500 index is currently at  $S_0 = \$ 4,000 $and the S&P indexed portfolio is expected to pay an annual dividend yield of 2\%$ , or D = \$80$. If the risk-free interest rate is  $1\%$ , a one-year maturity contract should have a futures price of

$$
F _ {0} = S _ {0} (1 + r _ {f} - d) = 4, 0 0 0 (1 + . 0 1 -. 0 2) = 3, 9 6 0
$$ or,equivalently,


$$
F _ {0} = S _ {0} (1 + r _ {f}) - D = 4, 0 0 0 (1 + . 0 1) - 8 0 = 3, 9 6 0
$$

Any deviation from parity gives rise to risk-free arbitrage opportunities. Example 22.9 illustrates how to exploit violations of the parity relation.

# Example 22.9 Futures Market Arbitrage

Suppose the one-year maturity futures price were  $3,965 rather than the "appropriate" value of$ 3,960 that we found in Example 22.8. The arbitrage portfolio entails a long position in the relatively underpriced index and a short position in the relatively overpriced futures contract with borrowing used to pay for the stock purchase.

<table><tr><td>Action</td><td>Initial
Cash Flow</td><td>Cash Flow in
1 Year</td></tr><tr><td>Borrow $4,000; repay with interest at year-end</td><td>+$4,000</td><td>-$4,000 × 1.01 = -$4,040</td></tr><tr><td>Buy stock index for $4,000</td><td>-$4,000</td><td>ST+ $80 dividend</td></tr><tr><td>Enter short futures position (FO = $3,965)</td><td>0</td><td>$3,965 - ST</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>$ 0</td><td>5</td></tr></table>

The net initial investment of this strategy is zero. Moreover, its cash flow in one year is positive and riskless: The total payoff will be  $5 regardless of the value of the S&P 500. The profit is precisely equal to the mispricing of the futures contract,$ 3,965 rather than 3,960.

If an arbitrage opportunity like the one in Example 22.9 existed, market participants would rush to take advantage of it. The results? The stock price would be bid up, and/or the futures price offered down, until Equation 22.1 were satisfied. A similar analysis applies to the possibility that  $F_0$  is less than $3,960. In this case, you simply reverse the strategy above to earn riskless profits. We conclude, therefore, that in a well-functioning market in which arbitrage opportunities are competed away,  $F_0 = S_0(1 + r_f) - D$ .

# Concept Check 22.5

Return to the arbitrage strategy laid out in Example 22.9. What would be the three steps of the strategy if  $F_0$  were too low, say, 3,950? Work out the cash flows of the strategy now and in one year in a table like the one in the example. Confirm that your profits equal the mispricing of the contract.

The arbitrage strategy of Example 22.9 can be represented more generally as follows:

<table><tr><td>Action</td><td>Initial Cash Flow</td><td>Cash Flow in 1 Year</td></tr><tr><td>1. Borrow S0 dollars</td><td>S0</td><td>-S0(1 + rf)</td></tr><tr><td>2. Buy stock for S0</td><td>-S0</td><td>ST+D</td></tr><tr><td>3. Enter short futures position</td><td>0</td><td>F0 - ST</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>0</td><td>F0 - So(1 + rf) + D</td></tr></table>

The initial cash flow is zero by construction: The money necessary to purchase the stock in step 2 is borrowed in step 1, and the futures position in step 3, which is used to hedge the value of the stock position, does not require an initial outlay. Moreover, the total cash flow at year-end is riskless because it involves only terms that are already known when the contract is entered into. If the final cash flow were not zero, all investors would try to cash in on the arbitrage opportunity. Ultimately, prices would change until the year-end cash flow is reduced to zero, at which point  $F_{0}$  would equal  $S_{0}(1 + r_{f}) - D$ .


The parity relationship also is called the cost-of-carry relationship because it asserts that the futures price is determined by the relative costs of buying a stock with deferred delivery in the futures market versus buying it in the spot market with immediate delivery and "carrying" it in inventory. If you buy stock now, you tie up your funds and incur a time-value-of-money cost of  $r_f$  per period. On the other hand, you receive dividend payments with a current yield of  $d$ . The net carrying cost advantage of deferring delivery of the stock is therefore  $r_f - d$  per period. This advantage must be offset by a differential between the futures price and the spot price. The price differential just offsets the cost-of-carry advantage when  $F_0 = S_0(1 + r_f - d)$ .

The parity relationship is easily generalized to multiperiod applications. We simply recognize that the difference between the futures and spot price will be larger as the maturity of the contract is longer. This reflects the longer period to which we apply the net cost of carry. For contract maturity of  $T$  periods, the parity relationship is

$$
F _ {0} = S _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f} - d\right) ^ {T} \tag {22.2}
$$

In 2021, the T-bill rate was about  $0.1\%$  and the dividend yield on the S&P 500 was around  $2.0\%$ . Therefore, with  $r_f < d$ , Equation 22.2 would predict that futures prices should be less than the spot price, and by greater amounts for longer maturities. This is exactly what we observe in the S&P listing in Figure 22.1. (Compare the settlement prices for the December 2021 versus June 2022 S&P 500 contract.)

Although dividends of individual securities may fluctuate unpredictably, the annualized dividend yield of a broad-based index such as the S&P 500 is fairly stable. The yield is seasonal, however, with regular peaks and troughs, so the dividend yield for the relevant months should be used. Figure 22.5 illustrates the yield pattern for the S&P 500. Some months, such as January or April, have consistently low yields, while others, such as May, have consistently high ones.

We have described parity in terms of stocks and stock index futures, but it should be clear that the logic applies as well to any financial futures contract. For gold futures, for example, we would simply set the dividend yield to zero. For bond contracts, we would let the coupon income on the bond play the role of dividend payments. In both cases, the parity relationship would be essentially the same as Equation 22.2.

The arbitrage strategy described above should convince you that these parity relationships are more than just theoretical results. Any violations of the parity relationship give rise to arbitrage opportunities that can provide large profits to traders. We will see in Chapter 23 that index arbitrage in the stock market is a tool to exploit violations of the parity relationship for stock index futures contracts.

# Spreads

Just as we can predict the relationship between spot and futures prices, there are similar ways to determine the proper relationships among futures prices for contracts of different maturity dates. Equation 22.2 shows that the futures price is in part determined by time to maturity. If the risk-free rate is greater than the dividend yield (i.e.,  $r_f > d$ ), then the futures price will be higher on longer-maturity contracts, and if  $r_f < d$ , longer-maturity futures prices will be lower. For futures on assets like gold, which pay no "dividend yield," we can set  $d = 0$  and conclude that  $F$  must increase as time to maturity increases.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/722b6ffe04e85fec445e1056275acb4e472fa8b194d6f84cd5b322136d9bea4f.jpg)
Figure 22.5 S&P 500 dividend yield

To be more precise about spread pricing, call  $F(T_{1})$  the current futures price for delivery at date  $T_{1}$  and  $F(T_{2})$  the futures price for delivery at date  $T_{2}$ . Let  $d$  be the dividend yield of the stock. We know from the parity Equation 22.2 that

$$
F (T _ {1}) = S _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f} - d\right) ^ {T _ {1}}
$$

$$
F (T _ {2}) = S _ {0} \left(1 + r _ {f} - d\right) ^ {T _ {2}}
$$

As a result,

$$
F \left(T _ {2}\right) / F \left(T _ {1}\right) = \left(1 + r _ {f} - d\right) ^ {\left(T _ {2} - T _ {1}\right)}
$$

Therefore, the basic parity relationship for spreads is

$$
F \left(T _ {2}\right) = F \left(T _ {1}\right) \left(1 + r _ {f} - d\right) ^ {\left(T _ {2} - T _ {1}\right)} \tag {22.3}
$$

Equation 22.3 should remind you of the spot-futures parity relationship. The major difference is in the substitution of  $F(T_{1})$  for the current spot price. The intuition is also similar. Delaying delivery from  $T_{1}$  to  $T_{2}$  assures the long position that the stock will be purchased for  $F(T_{2})$  dollars at  $T_{2}$  but does not require that money be tied up in the stock until  $T_{2}$ . The savings realized are the net cost of carry between  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ . Delaying delivery from  $T_{1}$  until  $T_{2}$  frees up  $F(T_{1})$  dollars, which earn risk-free interest at  $r_{f}$ . The delayed delivery of the stock also results in the lost dividend yield between  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ . The net cost of carry saved by delaying the delivery is thus  $r_{f} - d$ . This gives the proportional increase in the futures price required to compensate market participants for the delayed delivery of the stock and postponement of the payment of the futures price. If the parity condition for spreads is violated, arbitrage opportunities will arise. (Problem 19 at the end of the chapter explores this possibility.)

# Example 22.10 Spread Pricing

To see how to use Equation 22.3, consider the following data for a hypothetical contract:

<table><tr><td>Contract Maturity Data</td><td>Futures Price</td></tr><tr><td>January 15</td><td>105.00</td></tr><tr><td>March 15</td><td>105.09</td></tr></table>

Suppose that the effective annual T-bill rate is  $3\%$  and that the dividend yield is  $2\%$  per year. The "correct" March futures price given the January price is, according to Equation 22.3,

$$
1 0 5 (1 +. 0 3 -. 0 2) ^ {2 / 1 2} = 1 0 5. 1 7
$$

The actual March futures price is 105.09, making it slightly underpriced compared to the January futures price so that, aside from transaction costs, an arbitrage opportunity seems to be present.

Equation 22.3 shows that futures prices with different maturities should all move together. This is not surprising because all are linked to the same spot price through the parity relationship. Figure 22.6 plots futures prices on gold for three maturity dates. It is apparent that the prices move in virtual lockstep and that the more distant delivery dates command higher futures prices, as Equation 22.3 predicts.

# Forward versus Futures Pricing

Until now we have paid little attention to the differing time profile of returns of futures and forward contracts. Instead, we have taken the sum of daily mark-to-market proceeds to the

Strictly speaking, our parity theorems are appropriate for forward pricing because they assume that contract proceeds are in fact realized only on delivery. In contrast, the actual timing of cash flows conceivably might affect the futures price.


Futures prices will deviate from parity when marking gives a systematic advantage to either the long or short position. If marking to market tends to favor the long position, for example, the futures price should exceed the forward price because the long position will be willing to pay a premium for that advantage.

When will marking to market favor either a long or short trader? A trader will benefit if daily settlements are received (and can be invested) when the interest rate is high; symmetrically, a trader will benefit when daily settlements are paid (and can be financed) when the interest rate is low. Because long positions will benefit if futures prices tend to rise when interest rates are high, they will be willing to accept a higher futures price if there is a positive correlation between interest rates and changes in futures prices. In this situation, the "fair" futures price will exceed the forward price. Conversely, a negative correlation means that marking to market favors the short position and implies that the equilibrium futures price should be below the forward price.

For most contracts, the covariance between futures prices and interest rates is so low that the difference between futures and forward prices will be negligible. However, contracts on long-term fixed-income securities are a notable exception to this rule. In this case, because prices have a high correlation with interest rates, the covariance can be large enough to generate a meaningful spread between forward and futures prices.

# 22.5 Futures Prices versus Expected Spot Prices

So far we have considered the relationship between futures prices and the current spot price. What about the relationship between the futures price and the expected value of the spot price? In other words, how well does the futures price forecast the ultimate spot price? Three traditional theories have been put forth: the expectations hypothesis, normal backwardation, and contango. Today's consensus is that all of these traditional hypotheses are subsumed by modern portfolio theory. Figure 22.7 shows the expected path of futures under the three traditional hypotheses.

# Expectations Hypothesis

The expectations hypothesis is the simplest theory of futures pricing. It states that the futures price equals the expected value of the future spot price:  $F_0 = E(P_T)$ . Under this theory the expected profit to either position of a futures contract would equal zero: The short position's expected profit is  $F_0 - E(P_T)$ , whereas the long's is  $E(P_T) - F_0$ . With  $F_0 = E(P_T)$ , the expected profit to either side is zero.

The expectations hypothesis resembles market equilibrium in a world with no uncertainty; that is, if prices of goods at all future dates were currently known, then the futures price for delivery at any particular date would equal the currently known future spot price for that date. It is a tempting but incorrect leap to then assert that under uncertainty the futures price should equal the currently expected spot price. This view ignores the risk premiums that must be built into futures prices when ultimate spot prices are uncertain.

# Normal Backwardation

This theory is associated with the famous British economists John Maynard Keynes and John Hicks. They argued that for most commodities there are natural hedgers who wish to shed risk. For example, wheat farmers desire to shed the risk of uncertain wheat prices. These farmers will take short positions to deliver wheat at a guaranteed price; they will short hedge. To induce speculators to take the corresponding long positions, the farmers need to offer them an expectation of profit. Speculators will enter the long side of the contract only if the futures price is below the expected spot price of wheat, providing an expected profit of  $E(P_T) - F_0$ . The speculators' expected profit is the farmers' expected loss, but farmers are willing to bear this expected loss to avoid the risk of uncertain wheat prices. The theory of normal backwardation thus suggests that the futures price will be

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/b269c3a1ca5e388a7494f041dbd004e218a3d236debbc845c4ce4167eab4afcd.jpg)
Figure 22.7 Futures price over time, in the special case that the expected spot price remains unchanged


bid down to a level below the expected spot price and will rise over the life of the contract until the maturity date, at which point  $F_{T} = P_{T}$ .

Although this theory recognizes the important role of risk premiums in futures markets, it is based on total variability rather than on systematic risk. (This is not surprising, as Keynes wrote almost 40 years before the development of modern portfolio theory.) The modern view refines the measure of risk used to determine appropriate risk premiums.

# Contango

The contango theory holds that the natural hedgers are the purchasers of a commodity, rather than the suppliers. In the case of wheat, for example, we would view grain processors as willing to pay a premium to lock in their purchase price. These processors hedge by taking a long position in the futures market; therefore, they are called long hedgers, whereas farmers are short hedgers. Because long hedgers will agree to pay high futures prices to shed risk, and because speculators must be paid a premium to enter the short position, the contango theory holds that  $F_{0}$  must exceed  $E(P_{T})$ .

It is clear that any commodity will have both natural long hedgers and short hedgers. The compromise traditional view, called the "net hedging hypothesis," is that  $F_{0}$  will be less than  $E(P_{T})$  when short hedgers outnumber long hedgers and vice versa. The strong side of the market will be the side (short or long) that has more natural hedgers. The strong side must pay a premium to induce speculators to enter into enough contracts to balance the "natural" supply of long and short hedgers.

# Modern Portfolio Theory

The three traditional hypotheses all envision a mass of speculators willing to enter either side of the futures market if they are sufficiently compensated for the risk they incur. Modern portfolio theory fine-tunes this approach by refining the notion of risk. Simply put, if commodity prices pose positive systematic risk, futures prices must be lower than expected spot prices.

To illustrate, consider once again a stock paying no dividends. If  $E(P_{T})$  denotes the expected time- $T$  stock price and  $k$  denotes the required rate of return on the stock, then the price of the stock must equal the present value of its expected future payoff:

$$
P _ {0} = \frac {E \left(P _ {T}\right)}{\left(1 + k\right) ^ {T}} \tag {22.4}
$$

We also know from the spot-futures parity relationship that

$$
P _ {0} = \frac {F _ {0}}{\left(1 + r _ {f}\right) ^ {T}} \tag {22.5}
$$

Therefore, the right-hand sides of Equations 22.4 and 22.5 must be equal. Equating these terms allows us to solve for  $F_{0}$  in terms of the expected spot price:

$$
F _ {0} = E \left(P _ {T}\right) \left(\frac {1 + r _ {f}}{1 + k}\right) ^ {T} \tag {22.6}
$$

You can see immediately from Equation 22.6 that  $F_{0}$  will be less than the expectation of  $P_{T}$  whenever  $k$  is greater than  $r_{f}$ , which will be the case for any positive-beta asset. This means that the long side of the contract will make an expected profit  $[F_{0}$  will be lower than  $E(P_{T})]$  when the commodity exhibits positive systematic risk (i.e., if  $k$  is greater than  $r_{f}$ ).

Why should this be? A long future's position will provide a profit (or loss) of  $P_T - F_0$ . If the ultimate value of  $P_T$  entails positive systematic risk, so will the profit to the long position. Speculators with well-diversified portfolios will be willing to enter long futures positions only if they receive compensation for bearing that risk in the form of positive expected profits. Their expected profits will be positive only if  $E(P_T)$  is greater than  $F_0$ . Conversely, the short position's profit is the negative of the long position's and will have negative systematic risk. Diversified investors in the short position will be willing to suffer an expected loss to reduce portfolio risk and will be willing to enter the contract even when  $F_0$  is less than  $E(P_T)$ . We conclude that if  $P_T$  has positive beta,  $F_0$  must be less than the expectation of  $P_T$ , while the analysis is reversed for negative-beta assets.

# Concept Check 22.6

What must be true of the risk of the spot price of an asset if the futures price is an unbiased estimate of the ultimate spot price?

# SUMMARY

1. Forward contracts call for future delivery of an asset at a currently agreed-on price. The long trader purchases the good, and the short trader delivers it. If the price of the asset at the maturity of the contract exceeds the forward price, the long side benefits by virtue of acquiring the good at the contract price.
2. A futures contract is similar to a forward contract, differing most importantly in the aspects of standardization and marking to market, which is the process by which gains and losses on futures contract positions are settled daily. In contrast, forward contracts call for no cash transfers until contract maturity.
3. Futures contracts are traded on organized exchanges that standardize the size of the contract, the grade of the deliverable asset, the delivery date, and the delivery location. Traders negotiate only over the contract price. This standardization increases liquidity and means that buyers and sellers can easily find many traders for a desired purchase or sale.
4. The clearinghouse steps in between each pair of traders, acting as the short position for each long and as the long position for each short. In this way traders need not be concerned about the performance of the trader on the opposite side of the contract. In turn, traders post margins to guarantee their own performance.
5. The long position's gain or loss between time 0 and time  $t$  is  $F_{t} - F_{0}$ . Because at the maturity date,  $T$ ,  $F_{T} = P_{T}$ , the long's profit if the contract is held until maturity is  $P_{T} - F_{0}$ , where  $P_{T}$  is the spot price at time  $T$  and  $F_{0}$  is the original futures price. The short position's profit is  $F_{0} - P_{T}$ .
6. Futures contracts may be used for hedging or speculating. Speculators use the contracts to take a stand on the ultimate price of an asset. Short hedgers take short positions in contracts to offset any gains or losses on the value of an asset already held in inventory. Long hedgers take long positions to offset gains or losses in the purchase price of a good.
7. The spot-futures parity relationship states that the equilibrium futures price on an asset providing no service or payments (such as dividends) is  $F_0 = P_0(1 + r_f)^T$ . If the futures price deviates from this value, then market participants can earn arbitrage profits.
8. If the asset provides services or payments with yield  $d$ , the parity relationship becomes  $F_0 = P_0(1 + r_f - d)^T$ . This model is also called the cost-of-carry model because it states that the futures price must exceed the spot price by the net cost of carrying the asset until maturity date  $T$ .
9. The equilibrium futures price will be less than the currently expected time  $T$  spot price if the spot price exhibits systematic risk. This provides an expected profit for the long position who bears the risk and imposes an expected loss on the short position who is willing to accept that expected loss as a means to shed systematic risk.

# KEY TERMS

# KEY EQUATIONS

Spot-futures parity:  $F_0(T) = S_0(1 + r - d)^T$

Futures spread parity:  $F_{0}(T_{2}) = F_{0}(T_{1}) (1 + r - d)^{(T_{2} - T_{1})}$

Futures vs. expected spot prices:  $F_{0}(T) = E(P_{T})\left(\frac{1 + r_{f}}{1 + k}\right)^{T}$

# PROBLEM SETS

13. FinTrade has just introduced a single-stock futures contract on Brandex stock, a company that currently pays no dividends. Each contract calls for delivery of 1,000 shares of stock in one year. The T-bill rate is  $6\%$  per year.

a. If Brandex stock now sells at 120 per share, what should the futures price be?
b. If the Brandex price drops by  $3\%$ , what will be the change in the futures price and the change in the investor's margin account?
c. If the margin on the contract is 12,000, what is the percentage return on the investor's position?

14. The multiplier for a futures contract on a stock market index is 50. The maturity of the contract is one year, the current level of the index is 4,500, and the risk-free interest rate is .5\% per month. The dividend yield on the index is .2\% per month. Suppose that after one month, the stock index is at 4,550.

a. Find the cash flow from the mark-to-market proceeds on the contract. Assume that the parity condition always holds exactly.
$b$ . Find the holding-period return if the initial margin on the contract is 10,000.

15. You are a corporate treasurer who will purchase 1 million of bonds for the sinking fund in three months. You believe rates will soon fall, and you would like to repurchase the company's sinking fund bonds (which currently are selling below par) in advance of requirements. Unfortunately, you must obtain approval from the board of directors for such a purchase, and this can take up to two months. What action can you take in the futures market to hedge any adverse movements in bond yields and prices until you can actually buy the bonds? Will you be long or short? Why? A qualitative answer is fine.
16. The S&P portfolio pays a dividend yield of  $1\%$  annually. Its current value is 4,000. The T-bill rate is  $4\%$ . Suppose the S&P futures price for delivery in one year is 4,100. Construct an arbitrage strategy to exploit the mispricing and show that your profits one year hence will equal the mispricing in the futures market.
17. The Excel Application box in the chapter (available in Connect; link to Chapter 22 material) shows how to use the spot-futures parity relationship to find a "term structure of futures prices," that is, futures prices for various maturity dates.

a. Suppose that today is January 1, 2023. Assume the interest rate is  $3\%$  per year and a stock index currently at 2,000 pays a dividend yield of  $2.0\%$ . Find the futures price for contract maturity dates of (i) February 14, 2023; (ii) May 21, 2023; and (iii) November 18, 2023.
$b$ . What happens to the term structure of futures prices if the dividend yield is higher than the risk-free rate? For example, what if the dividend yield is  $4\%$ ?

18. a. How should the parity condition (Equation 22.2) for stocks be modified for futures contracts on Treasury bonds? What should play the role of the dividend yield in that equation?

$b$ . In an environment with an upward-sloping yield curve, should T-bond futures prices on more-distant contracts be higher or lower than those on near-term contracts?
c. Confirm your intuition by examining Figure 22.1.

19. Consider this arbitrage strategy to derive the parity relationship for spreads: (i) enter a long futures position with maturity date  $T_{1}$  and futures price  $F(T_{1})$ ; (ii) enter a short position with maturity  $T_{2}$  and futures price  $F(T_{2})$ ; (iii) at  $T_{1}$ , when the first contract expires, buy the asset and borrow  $F(T_{1})$  dollars at rate  $r_f$ ; (iv) pay back the loan with interest at time  $T_{2}$ .

$a$ . What are the total cash flows to this strategy at times  $0$ ,  $T_{1}$ , and  $T_{2}$ ?
$b$ . Why must profits at time  $T_{2}$  be zero if no arbitrage opportunities are present?
c. What must the relationship between  $F(T_{1})$  and  $F(T_{2})$  be for the profits at  $T_{2}$  to be equal to zero? This relationship is the parity relationship for spreads.

4. The risk would be that the index and the portfolio do not move perfectly together. Thus, basis risk involving the spread between the futures price and the portfolio value could persist even if the index futures price were set perfectly relative to the index itself. You can measure this risk using the index model introduced in Chapter 8. If you regress the return of the active portfolio on the return of the index portfolio, the regression  $R$ -square will equal the proportion of the variance of the active portfolio's return that could have been hedged using the index futures contract. You can also measure the risk of the imperfectly hedged position using the standard error of the regression, which tells you the standard deviation of the residuals in the index model. Because these are the components of the risky returns that are independent of the market index, this standard deviation measures the variability of the portion of the active portfolio's return that cannot be hedged using the index futures contract.


5. The futures price, $3,950, is $10 below the parity value of 3,960. The cash flow to the following strategy is riskless and equal to this mispricing.

<table><tr><td>Action</td><td>Initial Cash Flow</td><td>Cash Flow in 1 Year</td></tr><tr><td>Lend S0 dollars</td><td>-4,000</td><td>4,000(1.01) = 4,040</td></tr><tr><td>Sell stock short</td><td>+4,000</td><td>-S_T - 80</td></tr><tr><td>Long futures</td><td>0</td><td>S_T - 3,950</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>0</td><td>10 risklessly</td></tr></table>

6. It must have zero beta. If the futures price is an unbiased estimator, then we infer that it has a zero risk premium, which means that beta must be zero.
