# International Diversification

# 25

ALTHOUGH WE IN the United States customarily use a broad index of U.S. equities as the market-index portfolio, the practice is increasingly inappropriate. U.S. equities represent only about  $40\%$  of world equities and a far smaller fraction of total world wealth. In this chapter, we look beyond domestic markets to survey issues of international and extended diversification.

In one sense, international investing may be viewed as no more than a straightforward generalization of our earlier treatment of portfolio selection, with a larger menu of assets from which to construct a portfolio. Similar issues of diversification, security analysis, security selection, and asset allocation face the investor. On the other hand, international investments pose some problems not encountered in domestic markets. Among these are the presence of exchange rate risk, restrictions on capital flows across national boundaries, an added dimension of political risk and country-specific regulations, and differing informational transparency in different countries. Therefore, in this chapter we review the major topics covered in the rest of the book, emphasizing their international aspects.


We begin with a brief description of international equity markets, pointing out the wide range of venues available to investors. We then turn to the central concepts of portfolio theory—risk and diversification. We will see how exchange rate fluctuations add another element to the uncertainty surrounding rates of return. However, global diversification offers opportunities for improving portfolio risk—return trade-offs. International investing also entails a range of political risks. We consider several of these risks as well as sources of information pertaining to them. Finally, we show how active asset allocation can be generalized to incorporate country and currency choices in addition to traditional domestic asset class choices and demonstrate performance attribution methods in an international context.

# 25.1 Global Markets for Equities

You can easily invest today in the capital markets of nearly 100 countries and obtain up-to-date data about your investments in each of them. In 2020, at least 35 countries had stock markets with market capitalization above 100 billion.

U.S. investors have several avenues through which they can invest internationally. The most obvious method, which is available in practice primarily to larger institutional investors, is to purchase securities directly in the capital markets of other countries. However, even small investors can take advantage of several investment vehicles with an international focus.

Shares of several foreign firms are traded in U.S. markets either directly or in the form of American depositary receipts, or ADRs. A U.S. financial institution such as a bank will purchase shares of a foreign firm in that firm's country and then issue claims to those shares in the United States. Each ADR is then a claim on a given number of the shares of stock held by the bank. Some stocks trade in the U.S. both directly and as ADRs.

There is also a wide array of mutual funds with an international focus. In addition to single-country funds, there are several open-end mutual funds with an international focus. For example, Fidelity offers funds with investments concentrated overseas, generally in Europe, in the Pacific Basin, and in developing economies in an emerging opportunities fund. Vanguard, consistent with its indexing philosophy, offers separate index funds for Europe, the Pacific Basin, and emerging markets. Finally, as noted in Chapter 4, there are many exchange-traded funds known as iShares or WEBS (World Equity Benchmark Shares) that are country-specific index products.

U.S. investors also can trade derivative securities based on prices in foreign security markets. For example, they can trade options and futures on the Nikkei stock index of 225 stocks traded on the Tokyo stock exchange or on FTSE (Financial Times Share Exchange) indexes of U.K. and European stocks.

The investments industry commonly distinguishes between "developed" and "emerging" markets. A typical emerging economy still is undergoing industrialization, is growing faster than developed economies, and has capital markets that usually entail greater risk. We use the FTSE $^1$  classifications, which emphasize capital market conditions, to characterize markets as emerging or developed.

# Developed Countries

To appreciate the myopia of an exclusive investment focus on U.S. stocks and bonds, consider the data in Table 25.1. The U.S. accounts for only  $41\%$  of world stock market capitalization. Clearly, active investors can attain better risk-return trade-offs by extending their search for attractive securities abroad. Developed countries accounted for  $53.6\%$  of world gross domestic product and  $74.5\%$  of world market capitalization.

Table 25.1 presents data on both market capitalization and GDP for a sample of developed economies. The United States is the largest economy, measured by either GDP or the size of the stock market. However, Switzerland and Luxembourg are the leaders in GDP per capita, and Hong Kong has the largest stock market compared to GDP. On average, total stock market capitalization in these countries exceeds annual GDP, but there is tremendous variation in these numbers. Capitalization as a multiple of GDP for the countries toward the bottom of the list, with smaller capital markets, is generally far lower than for those countries near the top. This suggests widespread differences in economic structure even across developed markets.

# Emerging Markets

For a passive strategy, one could argue that a portfolio of equities of just the eight developed markets with the largest capitalization would make up over two-thirds of the world portfolio and may be sufficiently diversified. However, this argument will not hold for active portfolios that seek to tilt investments toward promising assets. Active portfolios will naturally include many stocks or indexes of emerging markets.

Surely, active portfolio managers do not want to neglect stocks in dynamic markets such as China. Table 25.2 shows data from the largest emerging markets. The economies in this table account for almost one-third of the world GDP. Per capita GDP in these emerging markets is quite variable, ranging from  \$1,826 (India) to\$ 60,621 (Qatar). Market capitalization as a percent of GDP in these countries still tends to be considerably lower than in the developed countries in Table 25.1, suggesting that these markets can grow significantly over the coming years, even without spectacular growth in GDP.

that allows citizens to legally own, capitalize, and trade capital assets. As a corollary, we expect that development of equity markets will serve as a catalyst for enrichment of the population.

Figure 25.1 depicts the relationship between per capita GDP and market capitalization for both emerging and developed markets. The positive slopes of the regression lines show that, on average, countries whose capital markets play larger roles in their economies also tend to have higher levels of per capita GDP. While this single-variable correlation cannot establish causality, it is at least consistent with the notion that well-functioning security markets that effectively allocate capital can also contribute to productivity. This pattern emerges even when we treat developed and emerging markets separately.

# Home-Country Bias

We know that purely passive investment strategies would call for risky portfolios that are indexed to a broad market portfolio. In the international context, that market portfolio would include stock markets from all nations, and the market index would be a broadly diversified world portfolio.


Despite this, it is clear that investors everywhere tend to overweight investments in their home countries (relative to representation in the world portfolio) and underweight investments in foreign assets. For example, referring back to Table 25.1, a purely indexed U.S. investor would hold about  $41\%$  of the total equity portfolio in U.S. securities, with the remaining  $59\%$  invested abroad. Yet in practice, we know that U.S. investors hold a large majority of their equity investments in U.S. firms. This pattern is mirrored in the behavior of investors around the world and is commonly called home-country bias.

# 25.2 Exchange Rate Risk and International Diversification

# Exchange Rate Risk

When a U.S. investor invests abroad, the dollar-denominated return depends on two factors: first, the performance of the investment in the local currency, and second, the exchange rate at which that investment can be brought back into dollars.

# Example 25.1 Exchange Rate Risk

Consider an investment in risk-free British government bills paying  $10 \%$ annual interest in British pounds. While these U.K. bills would be the risk- free asset to a British investor, this is not the case for a U.S. investor. Suppose, for example, the current exchange rate is  \$1.40 per pound and the U.S. investor starts with\$ 14,000. That amount can be exchanged for £10,000 and invested at a riskless  $10 \%$ rate in the United Kingdom to provide £11,000 in one year.

What happens if the dollar–pound exchange rate varies over the year? Say that during the year, the pound depreciates relative to the dollar, so that by year-end only \$1.20 is required to purchase £1. The £11,000 can be exchanged at the year-end exchange rate for only $13,200 (= £11,000 × $1.20/£), resulting in a loss of \$800 relative to the initial 14,000 investment. Despite the positive 10\% pound-denominated return, the dollar-denominated return is negative 4\%.

We can generalize from Example 25.1. The  \$14,000 is exchanged for\$ 14,000/E_0 pounds, where  $E_0$  denotes the original exchange rate ( \$1.40/£). The U.K. investment grows to$ (14,000 / E_0)[1 + r_f(\mathrm{UK})]$. British pounds, where  $r_f(\mathrm{UK})$  is the risk-free rate in the United Kingdom. The pound proceeds ultimately are converted back to dollars at the subsequent exchange rate  $E_{1}$ , for total dollar proceeds of  $14,000(E_{1} / E_{0})[1 + r_{f}(\mathrm{UK})]$ . Therefore, the dollar-denominated return on the investment in British bills is


$$
1 + r (\mathrm {U S}) = \left[ 1 + r _ {f} (\mathrm {U K}) \right] E _ {1} / E _ {0} \tag {25.1}
$$

We see in Equation 25.1 that the dollar-denominated return equals the pound-denominated return times the exchange rate "return." For a U.S. investor, the investment in British bills is a combination of a safe investment in the U.K. and a risky investment in the performance of the pound relative to the dollar. Here, the pound fared poorly, falling from a value of  \$1.40 to only\$ 1.20. The loss on the pound more than offset the earnings on the British bill.

Figure 25.2 illustrates this point. It presents rates of return on stock market indexes in several countries for 2021. The bottom bar in each pair depicts returns in local currencies, while the top bar depicts returns in U.S. dollars, adjusted for exchange rate movements.

The year 2021 was generally a quiet year for exchange rates, but even then, exchange rate fluctuations had large effects on dollar-denominated returns in some countries, for example, Turkey and Argentina, both of which experienced large currency depreciations.

# Concept Check 25.1

Using the data in Example 25.1, calculate the rate of return in dollars to a U.S. investor holding the British bill if the year-end exchange rate is (a)  $E_{1} = \1.40 / \text{£}; (b) E_{1} = \$ 1.50 / \text{£} .

Exchange rate risk arises from uncertainty in exchange rate fluctuations. The investor in safe U.K. bills in Example 25.1 still bears the risk of the U.K./U.S. exchange rate. We can assess the magnitude of exchange rate risk by examining historical rates of change in various exchange rates and their correlations.

Table 25.3, Panel A, presents the annualized standard deviation of monthly percent changes in the exchange rates of major currencies against the U.S. dollar over the 5-year period ending in April 2021. The data show that currency volatility can be quite high. With the exception of the Chinese RMB, the standard deviations of percent changes in exchange rates were sizeable fractions of the standard deviation of the rate of return of the S&P 500, with annualized values ranging from  $7.10\%$  (Canadian dollar) to  $9.06\%$  (British pound). The annualized standard deviation of returns on the S&P 500 for the same period was  $15.0\%$ . An active investor who believes that a foreign stock is underpriced but has no information about any mispricing of its currency should consider hedging the currency risk exposure when tilting the portfolio toward that stock.

On the other hand, exchange rate risk may be mostly diversifiable. This is evident both from the generally negative correlations between exchange rate changes and the return on the U.S. stock market shown in the second line of Table 25.3, Panel A, as well as the low correlation coefficients among currency pairs that appear in Panel B. While most of the correlations are positive (when the U.S. dollar depreciated against one currency, it was more likely to depreciate against others as well), exchange rates hardly moved in lockstep.

Investors can hedge exchange rate risk using a forward or futures contract in foreign exchange. Recall that such contracts entail delivery or acceptance of one currency for another at a stipulated exchange rate. To illustrate, recall Example 25.1. In this case, to hedge exposure to the British pound, the U.S. investor would agree to deliver pounds for dollars at a fixed exchange rate, thereby eliminating the risk involved with the eventual conversion of the pound investment back into dollars.

# Example 25.2 Hedging Exchange Rate Risk

If the forward exchange rate in Example 25.1 had been F0 = \$1.35/£ when the investment was made, the U.S. investor could have assured a riskless dollar-denominated return by arranging to deliver the £11,000 at the forward exchange rate of \$1.35/£. In this case, the riskless U.S. return would have been 6.07\%:

$$
[ 1 + r _ {r} (\mathsf {U K}) ] F _ {0} / E _ {0} = (1. 1 0) 1. 3 5 / 1. 4 0 = 1. 0 6 0 7
$$

The hedge underlying Example 25.2 is the same strategy at the heart of the spot-futures parity relationship, first discussed in Chapter 22. In both instances, futures or forward markets are used to eliminate the risk of holding another asset. The U.S. investor can lock in a riskless dollar-denominated return either by investing in U.K. bills and hedging exchange rate risk or by investing in riskless U.S. assets. Because investments in two riskless strategies must provide equal returns, we conclude that  $[1 + r_f(\mathrm{UK})]F_0 / E_0 = 1 + r_f(\mathrm{US})$ , which can be rearranged to

$$
\frac {F _ {0}}{E _ {0}} = \frac {1 + r _ {f} (\mathrm {U S})}{1 + r _ {f} (\mathrm {U K})} \tag {25.2}
$$

This relationship is called the interest rate parity relationship or covered interest arbitrage relationship, which we first encountered in Chapter 23.

Unfortunately, such perfect exchange rate hedging usually is not so easy. In our example, we knew exactly how many pounds to sell forward because the pound-denominated return in the United Kingdom was riskless. If the U.K. investment had not been in bills, but instead had been in risky U.K. equity, we would not have known the ultimate pound value of the U.K. investment or, therefore, how many pounds to sell forward. The hedging opportunity offered by foreign exchange forward contracts would thus be imperfect.

To summarize, the generalization of Equation 25.1 for unhedged investments is that

$$
1 + r (\mathrm {U S}) = [ 1 + r (\text {f o r e i g n}) ] E _ {1} / E _ {0} \tag {25.3}
$$ where  r(\text{foreign})  is the possibly risky return earned in the currency of the foreign investment and exchange rates are direct quotes ( per unit of foreign currency). You can set up a perfect hedge only in the special case that  r(\text{foreign})  is actually known. In that case, you must sell in the forward or futures market an amount of foreign currency equal to [1 + r(\text{foreign})] for each unit of that currency you purchase today.

How many pounds would the investor in Example 25.2 need to sell forward to hedge exchange rate risk if (a)  $r(\mathrm{UK}) = 20\%;$  (b)  $r(\mathrm{UK}) = 30\%$ ?

# Investment Risk in International Markets

While active-strategy managers engage in both individual-market asset allocation as well as security selection, we will restrict our focus to market-index portfolios across countries, keeping us on the side of an enhanced passive strategy. Nevertheless, our analysis illustrates the essential features of extended active management as well.

As we pointed out in Chapter 5, estimates of mean returns are extremely unreliable without very long data series. Little can be learned about average rates of return from periods as short as 5 or even 10 years. This is because estimates of expected return essentially depend on only the initial and final stock price (which fully determine the average compound rate of increase). Long sample periods are intrinsically necessary for precise estimates of expected return. However, over such long periods, the mean of the return distribution can change. This is a difficult hurdle for empirical research.

In contrast, estimates of volatility can be informed by return variation within the sample period. Increasing the frequency of observations therefore can increase the accuracy of risk estimates, making precise estimates feasible even with relatively short sample periods.

Therefore, we will focus largely on the risk of international investments, where we are more confident in our empirical estimates. We will use monthly data on country index returns for the five years ending in 2021.

Table 25.4 shows key statistics for the investment risk of various equity indexes during this period. The indexes include most of the world's largest equity markets as well as markets from regions with smaller and less developed capital markets. The first pair of columns show the standard deviation of monthly returns both measured in local currency as well as translated into U.S. dollars, thus reflecting the impact of exchange rate movements in each month.

Switzerland had the lowest volatility of equity returns, both in local as well as dollar-denominated terms. Its higher dollar-denominated volatility reflects the added risk attributable to exchange rate movements. But in general, the impact of exchange rate movements on the volatility of dollar-denominated returns is minimal. On average, the volatility of dollar-denominated returns is not much higher than that of local returns. (The mean and median estimates reported in Table 25.4 are computed only over the individual country indexes.)

Correlations with the MSCI World index, shown in the next pair of columns, are also broadly similar for local and dollar-denominated returns. (Local currency correlations use local-currency returns for both indexes and MSCI World; dollar-denominated correlations use exclusively dollar returns.) Not surprisingly, given the prominence of the U.S. in the World portfolio and the prominence of its economy in the world economy, the U.S. has the highest correlation with the World index. The Shanghai index is notable among the larger capital markets for its low correlation with the rest of the world.

Table 25.5 shows results for index model regressions of each country's (or region's) index against the MSCI World portfolio. The betas of each index against the World portfolio appear in the first pair of columns. The beta of the U.S. against the World portfolio is just about 1.0 when returns are measured in dollars. However, the average beta of other countries against the MSCI World portfolio is less than 1.0. Betas computed from dollar-denominated returns are on average lower than those using local returns but not substantially so.

We do not report country-index alphas in this table because results over five years are such unreliable forecasts of future performance. As we noted above, this is a common problem in using a historical sample to estimate expected returns (as opposed to risk measures). It is why many decades of data are commonly used to estimate "normal" returns on the broad market portfolio. Nevertheless, in this sample period, we can report that the median alpha measured in local currencies was small, only  $-15$  basis points. The dollar generally was little changed against other currencies in this period, so the average dollar-denominated alpha was virtually identical,  $-15$  basis points per month.

The second pair of columns in Table 25.5 show the residual standard deviation for each country index. As discussed in Chapter 8, the regression residual in each month is the portion of the index return that is independent of the return on the World portfolio. The entries in these columns are therefore estimates of the standard deviation of "country-specific returns." The results are consistent with the other risk measures. The U.S. has the lowest country-specific risk, reflecting its prominence in the World portfolio. Indexes for the countries in the Arab world and Latin America have considerably higher nonsystematic risk despite the fact that these indexes already enjoy some diversification across the countries

# Table 25.5

Index model regressions of country or region indexes against the MSCI World index using both local and dollar-denominated returns included in each region. Average country-specific risk is essentially the same regardless of whether returns are measured in local or foreign currency. By and large, country-specific risk is meaningful. Even the U.S. value of  $0.8\%$  per month (dollar-denominated returns) is not trivial. The message is that international diversification is potentially valuable.


By and large, the results in Table 25.4 and Table 25.5 indicate that investment risk is pretty much the same regardless of whether we use local currency or dollar-denominated returns. Therefore, we will focus largely on local-currency returns when we turn to the potential for international diversification in the next section.

# International Diversification

In Chapter 7, we looked at the risk of equally weighted portfolios composed of different numbers of U.S. stocks chosen at random and saw the efficacy of naive diversification. Figure 25.3 presents the results of a similar

It's one of the golden rules of investing: Reduce risk by diversifying your money into a variety of holdings—stock funds, bonds, commodities—that don't move in lockstep with one another. And it's a rule that's getting tougher to obey.

According to recent research, an array of investments whose prices used to rise and fall independently are now increasingly correlated. For investors, that poses a troubling issue: how to maintain a portfolio diversified enough so all the pieces don't tank at once.

The current correlation trend doesn't mean investors should go out and ditch their existing investments. It's just that they may not be "getting the same diversification" they thought if the investment decisions were made some time ago, says Mr. Ezrati, chief economist at money-management firm Lord Abbott & Co. He adds that over long periods of time, going back decades, sometimes varied asset classes tend to converge.

One explanation for today's higher correlation is increased globalization, which has made the economies of various countries more interdependent. International stocks, even with their higher correlations at present, deserve some allocation in a long-term investor's holdings, says Jeff Tjornehoj, an analyst at data firm Lipper Inc. Mr. Tjornehoj is among those who believe these correlations are a temporary phenomenon, and expects that the diversity will return some time down the line—a year or few years.

exercise, but one in which diversification includes stocks from around the world. You can see that extending the universe of investable assets to foreign stocks allows even greater opportunities for risk reduction.

Of course, as emphasized in the nearby box, the benefits from diversification depend on the correlation structure among securities. The box notes that international correlations have increased over time. Table 25.6 shows correlation pairs (using local currency returns) for our sample of country and regional indexes. This correlation matrix can be used to construct the minimum-variance portfolio, which provides a better estimate of the

# Table 25.7

Composition and volatility of internationally diversified portfolios potential benefits from diversification than the naïve diversification exercise conducted in Figure 25.3.


Table 25.7 shows portfolio volatility using equal weights for each country or regional index (column 1), using minimum variance weights (column 2), or using minimum variance weights without allowing short sales (column 3). The equally weighted portfolio is in the spirit of Figure 25.3. Even naïve diversification provides considerable benefit: The standard deviation of the portfolio is  $15.1\%$ , which is only  $62\%$  of the average of the individual country and regional standard deviations. But we can reduce volatility considerably from this level. The minimum variance portfolio has a standard deviation of only  $7.6\%$  when we allow short sales, and  $10.2\%$  when we do not. We see here ample evidence for the potential of international diversification to substantially reduce portfolio risk.

What about efficient diversification that achieves the best risk-return trade-off? This is harder to assess because, as we have pointed out several times, sample average returns over short periods do not provide reliable estimates of expected returns. However, as an alternative to historical returns, we can estimate expected returns from an international version of the CAPM. Table 25.8 presents such estimates using the MSCI World index as the market portfolio and assuming a risk-free rate of  $2\%$  and market risk premium of  $8\%$ . Given these expected returns, the standard deviations in Table 25.4, and the correlation matrix in Table 25.6, we can generate the efficient frontier. The results appear in Figure 25.4.

The frontier in Figure 25.4 makes clear the benefits of international diversification. The U.S. market index appears as the solid dot. Given the fact that the U.S. has the highest Sharpe ratio of any individual country, it is perhaps not surprising that it plots near the boundary of the efficient frontier. Nevertheless, it is still located substantially below

The CAL supported by the U.S. index has a Sharpe ratio (based on monthly returns) of .2037. Although this is the highest ratio of any country or region in the sample, its Sharpe ratio is noticeably less than that of the tangency portfolio, .225. It is clear that a U.S. investor who forgoes international equity markets is giving up ample opportunities to improve the risk-return trade-off of the optimal risky portfolio.

# Are Benefits from International Diversification Preserved in Bear Markets?

Some studies suggest that correlation in country portfolio returns increases during periods of turbulence in capital markets. If so, benefits from diversification would be lost exactly when they are needed the most. For example, a study by Roll of the crash of October 1987 shows that all 23 country indexes studied declined over the crash period of October 12-26. Figure 25.5 shows returns of stock indexes from around the world on either October 19 or, to account for time zone differences, October 19-20. These common extreme losses indicate substantial cross-border correlation. Roll found that the beta of a country index on the world index (estimated prior to the crash) was the best predictor of that index's response to the October crash of the U.S. stock market. This suggests a common factor underlying the movement of stocks around the world. This model predicts that a macroeconomic shock would affect all countries and that while diversification can mitigate risk, it cannot eliminate exposure to such broad-based events.

The 2008 crash of stock markets around the world allows us to test Roll's prediction. The data in Figure 25.6 include average monthly rates of return for both the 10-year period 1999-2008 and the crisis period corresponding to the last four months of 2008, as well as the beta on the U.S. market and monthly standard deviation for several portfolios. The graph shows that both beta against the U.S. and the country-index standard deviation help explain the difference between crisis period returns and overall period averages. Market behavior during the 1987 crisis, that is, larger correlations in extreme bad times, repeated itself in the crisis of 2008, vindicating Roll's analysis.

# 25.3 Political Risk

In principle, security analysis at the macroeconomic, industry, and firm-specific levels is similar in all countries. Such analysis aims to provide estimates of expected returns and risks of individual assets and portfolios. However, information about assets in a foreign country is by nature more difficult to acquire.

In addition, political risk varies dramatically across countries, and its assessment requires expertise in each nation's economic, legal, tax, and political environment. A leading organization providing political risk assessment for investors is the PRS Group (Political Risk Services), and the presentation here follows the PRS methodology.

PRS's country risk analysis results in a country composite risk rating on a scale of 0 (most risky) to 100 (least risky). To illustrate, Table 25.9 shows the rank of a small sample of countries from the January 2021 issue of PRS's International Country Risk Guide. It is not surprising to find Singapore at the top of the low-risk list and small emerging markets at the bottom, with Sudan (ranked 140) closing the list. What may be surprising is the fairly mediocre ranking of the U.S. (ranked 38).

The composite risk rating is a weighted average of three measures: political risk, financial risk, and economic risk. Political risk is measured on a scale of 100–0, while financial risk and economic risk are each measured on a scale of 50–0. The three measures are added and divided by 2 to obtain the composite rating. The variables used by PRS to determine the composite risk rating from the three measures are shown in Table 25.10.

Table 25.11 shows the three risk measures for the same sample of countries in order of the ranking of composite risk. The table shows that the United States was among the best performers in terms of political risk. But it fared poorly in terms of financial and economic risk. The surprisingly poor performance of the U.S. in this dimension was probably due to its large government and balance-of-trade deficits. Exchange rate stability, foreign trade imbalance, and foreign indebtedness all enter PRS's computation of financial risk.

Finally, Table 25.12 shows ratings of political risk by each of its 12 components. The U.S. does well in corruption risk (variable F) and democratic accountability (variable K). China does well in government stability (variable A) but poorly in democratic accountability (variable K).

# 25.4 International Investing and Performance Attribution

Because many security markets may be less efficient than those in highly developed economies such as the U.S., international investing offers greater opportunities for active managers. International investing calls for specialization in additional fields of analysis: currency movements, country prospects, and industry analysis in a worldwide context; it also entails a larger universe for stock selection.

# Constructing a Benchmark Portfolio of Foreign Assets

Active (as well as passive) international investing requires a benchmark portfolio (called the bogey). One widely used international market index is the MSCI World index. MSCI also computes variants on this index that exclude some large markets such as the U.S.

Another popular non-U.S. index is the Europe, Australasia, Far East (EAFE) index of large and mid-cap securities in 21 developed markets, also computed by MSCI. Other indexes of world equity performance are published by Capital International Indices, Salomon Brothers, Credit Suisse First Boston, and Goldman Sachs. Portfolios designed to mirror or even replicate the country, currency, and company representation of these indexes would be the obvious generalization of the purely domestic passive equity strategy.

An issue that sometimes arises in the international context is the appropriateness of marketcapitalization weighting schemes in the construction of international indexes. Capitalization weighting is far and away the most common approach. However, some argue that it might not be the best weighting scheme in an international context. This is in part because different countries have differing proportions of their corporate sector organized as publicly traded firms.

Table 25.13 shows market-capitalization weights versus GDP weights for most of the countries in the EAFE index. These data reveal substantial disparities between the relative sizes of market capitalization and GDP. The countries with smaller stock markets (toward the bottom of the table) tend to have a much smaller share of EAFE total market capitalization than their share of EAFE GDP. For example, while Germany accounts for  $16.7\%$  of total EAFE GDP, it represents only  $6.4\%$  of the market cap of the index. At the other extreme, Hong Kong accounts for only  $1.5\%$  of GDP, but it represents  $4.2\%$  of total EAFE market cap. These disparities indicate that a greater proportion of economic activity is conducted by publicly traded firms in Hong Kong than in the other EAFE countries.

Some argue that it would be more appropriate to weight international indexes by GDP rather than market capitalization. The justification for this view is that an internationally diversified portfolio should purchase shares in proportion to the broad asset base of each country, and GDP might be a better measure of the weight of a country in the international economy than the value of its outstanding stocks. Others have even suggested weights proportional to the import share of various countries. The argument is that investors who wish to hedge the price of imported goods might choose to hold securities in foreign firms in proportion to the goods imported from those countries.

# Excel Questions

1. Find three points on the efficient frontier corresponding to three different expected returns. What are the portfolio standard deviations corresponding to each expected return?
2. Now assume that the correlation between the S&P 500 and the other country indexes is cut in half. Find the new standard deviations corresponding to each of the three expected returns. Are they higher or lower? Why?

# Performance Attribution

We can measure the contribution of each of the following decisions to portfolio performance following a procedure similar to the performance attribution techniques introduced in Chapter 24.

1. Currency selection measures the contribution to total portfolio performance attributable to exchange rate fluctuations relative to the investor's benchmark currency, which we will take to be the U.S. dollar. We might use a benchmark like the EAFE index to compare a portfolio's currency selection for a particular period to that of a passive benchmark. The benchmark for currency selection would be the weighted average of the appreciation of the currencies represented in the EAFE portfolio using as weights the fraction of that portfolio invested in each currency.

2. Country selection measures the contribution to portfolio performance attributable to investing in the better-performing stock markets of the world. It can be assessed from the weighted average of the equity index returns of each country using as weights the share of the manager's portfolio in each country. We use index returns to abstract from the effect of security selection within countries. To measure the contribution of country selection, we compare the manager's weighted average to the weighted average of a benchmark passive allocation, for example, the share of each country in the EAFE portfolio.
3. Stock selection ability may, as in Chapter 24, be measured as the weighted average of equity returns in excess of the equity index in each country. Here, we would use local currency returns and use as weights the investments in each country.
4. Cash/bond selection may be measured as the excess return derived from weighting bonds and bills differently from some benchmark weights.

Table 25.14 provides an example of how to measure the contribution of the decisions an international portfolio manager might make.

# Concept Check 25.3

Using the data in Table 25.14, compute the manager's country and currency selections if portfolio weights had been  $40\%$  in Europe,  $20\%$  in Australasia, and  $40\%$  in the Far East.

1. U.S. assets account for less than half of the world portfolio. International capital markets offer important opportunities for portfolio diversification with enhanced risk-return characteristics.
2. Exchange rate risk imparts an extra source of uncertainty to investments denominated in foreign currencies. Much of that risk can be hedged in foreign exchange futures or forward markets, but a perfect hedge is not feasible unless the foreign investment's rate of return is known in advance.
3. Returns in different countries are far from perfectly correlated. Therefore, there is a benefit from international diversification. The minimum variance global portfolio has considerably lower volatility than almost any individual country index, including that of the U.S. More importantly, single-country stock indexes, again including those of the U.S., plot considerably inside the efficient frontier constructed when foreign equity markets are added to the investment menu. Therefore, international investing offers ample opportunities to improve the risk-reward trade-off.
4. International investing entails an added dimension of political risk, including uncertainty about government and social stability, democratic accountability, macroeconomic conditions, international trade, and legal protections afforded individuals, businesses, and investors. Several services now exist that sell information about political risk to interested parties.
5. Several world market indexes can form a basis for passive international investing. Active international management can be partitioned into currency selection, country selection, stock selection, and cash/bond selection.

1. Do you agree with the following claim? "U.S. companies with global operations can give you international diversification." Think about both business risk and foreign exchange risk.
2. In Figure 25.2, we provide stock market returns in both local and dollar-denominated terms. Which of these is more relevant? What does this have to do with whether the foreign exchange risk of an investment has been hedged?

# PROBLEM SETS

3. Suppose a U.S. investor wishes to invest in a British firm currently selling for £40 per share. The investor has \$10,000 to invest, and the current exchange rate is \$2/£.

$a$ . How many shares can the investor purchase?
$b$ . Fill in the table below for rates of return after one year in each of the nine scenarios (three possible share prices denominated in pounds times three possible exchange rates).

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Price per Share (£)</td><td rowspan="2">Pound-Denominated
Return (\%)</td><td colspan="3">Dollar-denominated Return for Year-End Exchange Rate</td></tr><tr><td>$1.80/£</td><td>$2/£</td><td>2.20/£</td></tr><tr><td>£35</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>£40</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>£45</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

$c$ . When is the dollar-denominated return equal to the pound-denominated return?

4. If each of the nine outcomes in Problem 3 is equally likely, find the standard deviation of both the pound- and dollar-denominated rates of return.
 5. Now suppose the investor in Problem 3 also sells forward £5,000 at a forward exchange rate of 2.10/£.

$a$ . Recalculate the dollar-denominated returns for each scenario.

7. The Windsor Foundation, a U.S.-based, not-for-profit charitable organization, has a diversified investment portfolio of 100 million. Windsor's board of directors is considering an initial investment in emerging market equities. Robert Houston, treasurer of the foundation, has made the following comments: a. "For an investor holding only developed market equities, the existence of stable emerging market currencies is one of several preconditions necessary for that investor to realize strong emerging market performance."

b. "Local currency depreciation against the dollar has been a frequent occurrence for U.S. investors in emerging markets. U.S. investors have consistently seen large percentages of their returns erased by currency depreciation. This is true even for long-term investors."
c. "Historically, the addition of emerging market stocks to a U.S. equity portfolio such as the S&P 500 index has reduced volatility; volatility has also been reduced when emerging market stocks are combined with an international portfolio such as the MSCI EAFE index."

Discuss whether each of Houston's comments is correct or incorrect.

8. After much research on the developing economy and capital markets of the country of Otunia, your firm, GAC, has decided to include an investment in the Otunia stock market in its Emerging Markets Commingled Fund. However, GAC has not yet decided whether to invest actively or by indexing. Your opinion on the active versus indexing decision has been solicited. The following is a summary of the research findings:

Otunia's economy is fairly well-diversified across agricultural and natural resources, manufacturing (both consumer and durable goods), and a growing finance sector. Transaction costs in securities markets are relatively large in Otunia because of high commissions and government "stamp taxes" on securities trades. Accounting standards and disclosure regulations are quite detailed, resulting in wide public availability of reliable information about companies' financial performance.

Capital flows into and out of Otunia, and foreign ownership of Otunia securities, are strictly regulated by an agency of the national government. The settlement procedures under these ownership rules often cause long delays in settling trades made by nonresidents. Senior finance officials in the government are working to deregulate capital flows and foreign ownership, but GAC's political consultant believes that isolationist sentiment may prevent much real progress in the short run.

a. Briefly discuss aspects of the Otunia environment that favor investing actively and aspects that favor indexing.
b. Recommend whether GAC should invest in Otunia actively or by indexing. Justify your recommendation based on the factors identified in part (a).

# E-INVESTMENTS EXERCISES

A common misconception is that investors can earn excess returns by investing in foreign bonds with higher interest rates than are available in the U.S. Interest rate parity implies that any such interest rate differentials will be offset by premiums or discounts in the forward or futures market for foreign currency.

Interest rates on government bonds in the U.S., U.K., Japan, Germany, and Australia can be found at www.bloomberg.com. Look for the Rates and Bonds tab. Spot exchange rates on international currencies can be found by clicking the Currencies tab.

Forward exchange rates on currency futures contracts can be found at www.cmgroup.com.

1. Select one of these countries and record the yield on a short-term government security from the Bloomberg Web site. Also make note of the U.S. Treasury yield on an instrument with the same (or closest possible) maturity.
2. Record the spot exchange rate from the Bloomberg site and the futures exchange rate from the CME Web site for the date closest to the maturity of the investment you chose in the previous question.
3. Calculate the rate of return available on the foreign government security, converting the foreign currency transactions into dollars at the current and forward exchange rates.
4. How well does interest rate parity seem to hold? Are there bargains to be found in other currencies? What factors might account for interest rate parity violation?

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1.  $1 + r(\mathrm{US}) = [1 + r_f(\mathrm{UK})] \times (E_1 / E_0)$ a.  $1 + r(\mathrm{US}) = 1.1\times (1.40 / 1.40) = 1.10$  . Therefore,  $r(\mathrm{US}) = 10\%$

b.  $1 + r(\mathrm{US}) = 1.1 \times (1.50 / 1.40) = 1.179$ . Therefore,  $r(\mathrm{US}) = 17.9\%$ .

2. You must sell forward the number of pounds you will end up with at the end of the year. This value cannot be known with certainty, however, unless the rate of return of the pound-denominated investment is known.

a.  $10,000 \times 1.20 = 12,000$  pounds.
b.  $10,000 \times 1.30 = 13,000$  pounds.

# 3. Country selection:

$$
(0.40 \times 10\%) + (0.20 \times 5\%) + (0.40 \times 15\%) = 11 \%
$$

This is a loss of  $1.5\%$  (11\% versus 12.5\%) relative to the EAFE passive benchmark.

Currency selection:

$$
(0.40 \times 10 \%) + (0.20 \times (-10 \%)) + (0.40 \times 30 \%) = 14 \%
$$

This is a loss of  $6\%$  (14\% versus 20\%) relative to the EAFE benchmark.
