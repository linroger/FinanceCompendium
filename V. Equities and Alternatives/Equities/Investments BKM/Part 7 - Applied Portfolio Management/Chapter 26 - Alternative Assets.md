# Alternative Assets

# 26

THE TRADITIONAL ASSET CLASSES of publicly traded stocks and bonds still dominate the portfolios of most individual and institutional investors. But the universe of alternative assets has increased dramatically in recent decades for institutional investors as well as so-called accredited (wealthy and/or financially literate) individual investors. Though there is no standard definition of what makes an investment "alternative," they are generally classified into four major subclasses: hedge funds, private equity and debt, real assets, and structured products.

Alternatives raise virtually every issue addressed in earlier chapters—security analysis, market efficiency (or inefficiency), efficient diversification, hedging, liquidity, option pricing, and the quantification of risk. For example, venture capital funds invest in highly risky start-ups. The required rate of return on a venture fund is necessarily high, but its investments are made in a less efficient segment of the market. Moreover, venture capitalists (VCs) are not merely investors; as active stewards of their portfolio firms, their participation changes the value of those companies. VCs attempt to improve the structure and function of these start-ups with the end goal of generating substantial returns through successful exits.

Hedge funds, another class of alternative assets, often bet on the relative mispricing of specific securities but try to hedge broad market exposure; their strategies constitute a challenge to market efficiency. This sort of pure "alpha seeking" behavior requires a procedure for optimally mixing an investment in a hedge fund with a more traditional portfolio. Other hedge funds engage in aggressive market timing; their risk profiles can shift rapidly and substantially, raising difficult questions for performance evaluation. Many hedge funds take extensive derivatives positions. Even those funds that do not trade derivatives charge incentive fees that resemble the payoff to a call option; understanding options, therefore, is necessary to interpret hedge fund strategies as well as their costs. In short, alternative assets raise the full range of issues associated with active portfolio management.


We begin with an overview of alternative assets. We then survey the hedge fund universe, devoting considerable attention to the classic "market-neutral" or hedged strategies that historically gave hedge funds their name. We then turn to the private equity asset classes of venture capital and leveraged buyouts, focusing on how each of these investors generates value. We move on to evidence on the investment performance of alternative assets and the special difficulties in evaluating that performance. Finally, we consider the implications of the fee structures charged by such funds.

# 26.1 Alternative Assets

Alternative assets depart from traditional ones in both form and function. They comprise four broad sectors: hedge funds, private equity and debt, real assets, and structured products.

# The Alternative Asset Universe

Hedge Funds Like mutual funds, hedge funds are investment pools. The net asset value (NAV) of each share represents the value of the investor's stake in the portfolio. While hedge funds thus have many similarities to mutual funds, there are several important differences, including transparency, the investors themselves, liquidity, and investment strategies.

Private Equity Private equity funds are also pools of investments, though they aim to generate value through their direct impact on firm operations and strategy. Private equity includes angel investors, venture capital funds, and buyout funds. Angel investors are wealthy individuals or families who invest in entrepreneurs, typically in the earliest stages of development. Venture capital funds invest in entrepreneurs as well, but a VC fund is professionally managed, either as an independent firm or as an investment arm of a larger corporation. Leveraged buyout investors deploy considerable leverage to acquire publicly traded firms. Once acquired, these firms are private and subject to operational and financial restructuring. All three of these investment approaches differ markedly from one another, but all fall under the umbrella of private equity, as none of their assets under management trade publicly.

Real Assets Real assets include real estate, natural resources, and commodities. Real estate is ownership in land or buildings. The investment can be direct, such as a piece of rental property, or indirect, through investment vehicles such as a real estate investment trust (REIT), private equity real estate, or pooled mortgages (mortgage-backed securities).

Commodities are refined or extracted resources often used as production inputs, such as energy, metals, animal products, grains, and lumber. They are valued almost entirely in proportion to the volume of the commodity; that is, the market treats different batches of goods as effectively equivalent.

Structured Products Structured products combine securities and often derivatives to generate custom-designed market-linked outcomes. Structured products can be highly individualized with payoffs designed to generate customized risk exposures. They are built to protect a broader portfolio from specific risks; it is sometimes cheaper to employ a structurer (structured-product designer) rather than to use market-traded options, swaps, or other derivatives to achieve the desired return profile.

Chapter 1 emphasized that real assets include all those that convey intrinsic productive capacity; we will consider only investable assets.
2We will devote most of this chapter to hedge funds and private equity. There are many resources available for real estate investing. For example, Real Estate Finance and Investments (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2022) by William Brueggeman and Jeffrey Fisher is an excellent source on real estate investment vehicles and valuation. The Real Estate Game (New York: Free Press, 1999) by William Poorvu and Jeffrey Cruikshank is an accessible introductory treatment.

# Alternative Assets versus Traditional Assets

While an equilibrium risk-versus-expected return relationship should apply to all assets, alternatives differ significantly from traditional asset classes in structure, strategy, and other key characteristics. Here are some of the key differences.

Transparency Mutual funds are subject to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, which require transparency and predictability of strategy as well as periodic public updates on portfolio composition. In contrast, hedge funds and private equity usually are set up as limited liability partnerships or limited liability companies and provide minimal information about strategy and portfolio composition to their investors only.

Investors Hedge funds and private equity funds are open only to "accredited" investors, defined by minimum net worth ( \$1,000,000 excluding primary residence), income requirements (\$ 200,000+ per year for the past two years), or certain professional certifications or employment. They generally do not advertise to the public, and minimum investments often are between \$500,000 and \$1,000,000.

Investment Strategies Traditional mutual funds lay out their general investment approach in their prospectus and face pressure to avoid style drift (departure from their stated investment thesis). Most mutual funds promise to limit their use of short-selling and leverage, and their use of derivatives is highly restricted. Even so-called 130/30 mutual funds, which allow for more active short-selling and derivative positions, are far less flexible than hedge funds.

In contrast, hedge funds may effectively partake in any investment strategy and may act opportunistically as conditions evolve. Treating hedge funds as a uniform asset class would be highly misguided, for they engage in a wide range of styles and strategies—derivatives, distressed firms, currency speculation, convertible bonds, emerging markets, merger arbitrage, and so on. Some may jump from one asset class to another.

**Liquidity** Hedge funds often impose lock-up periods, that is, periods as long as several years in which investments cannot be withdrawn. Many also employ redemption notices requiring investors to provide notice weeks or months in advance of their desire to redeem funds. These restrictions limit investors' liquidity, in this case, the time it takes to convert their investments to cash. This limited liquidity, in turn, enables funds to invest in illiquid assets where returns may be higher, without worrying about meeting unanticipated demands for redemptions.

Similarly, private equity funds often impose lock-up periods following an IPO. This prevents large excessive sell pressure that might affect prices after an IPO. The average lock-up period is six months, though the average holding period of most private equity post-IPO is three years.[6] In contrast to private equity, some real assets, for example, commodity positions established via futures contracts, can be very liquid. Real estate, by contrast, is illiquid.

The Securities and Exchange Commission defines accredited investors in Regulation D, which was amended in 2020 to include several new categories, including the professional certifications Series 7, 65, and 82 and certain knowledgeable employees of private funds.
4 These are funds that may sell short up to  $30\%$  of the value of their portfolios, using the proceeds to increase their positions in invested assets. For every  $\$100$  in net assets, the fund may sell short  $\$30$ , investing the proceeds to increase its long positions to  $\$130$ . This gives rise to the 130/30 moniker. These mutual funds serve primarily institutional clients.
Even the name "hedge fund" is a misnomer; many fund strategies depart from the original, market-risk hedged strategy of the father of modern hedge funds, Alfred Jones.
Tim Jenkinson, Howard Jones, and Christian Rauch, "Long Goodbyes: Why Do Private Equity Funds Hold onto Public Equity?" (February 28, 2022). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3753480.

Investment Horizon Mutual fund investors do not have a fixed endpoint; most private equity funds do. For example, a venture capital fund is typically designed to last 10 years, at which point the fund is liquidated and proceeds are distributed to investors. Portfolio companies must be "harvested" and thus exited during that timeframe. Thus, private equity investments occur with one eye on the eventual exit from the portfolio companies.

Fee Structure Hedge funds and private equity also differ from mutual funds in their fee structure. Mutual funds assess management fees equal to a fixed percentage of assets under management (see Chapter 4 for a detailed treatment of the different ways fees are applied). The management fee for alternative investments is usually between  $1\%$  and  $2\%$  of assets, but these funds also typically charge an incentive fee equal to a fraction of any investment profits beyond some benchmark. The incentive fee is often  $20\%$ , subject to a threshold return that must be met (more on this in Section 26.6).

# Role of Alternative Assets in Diversified Portfolios

Chapter 25 demonstrated how international diversification improved the expected return-risk profile for a domestic investor because the correlation between domestic stocks and international stocks is typically considerably less than 1.0. We will see that alternative investments have similarly low correlations with traditional asset classes and thus offer significant diversification potential. Some hedge funds and private equity funds also have demonstrated high historical rates of return, suggesting they can act as "engines" of capital growth. Incorporating these asset classes would then increase the Sharpe ratio of a portfolio while allowing it to better reflect the full asset universe.

Endowments, foundations, and pension funds have found great success over long investment periods through the aggressive incorporation of alternative assets, notably hedge funds, private equity, and real assets like energy and timber funds. Endowments, particularly larger ones (those with more than 1 billion in assets under management), tend to tilt their allocations toward equity and alternatives in pursuit of their dual long-term investment goals of capital preservation and meeting or exceeding spending-rate targets.

Accredited investors may also include alternative investments in their portfolios for long-term growth and diversification. While the investment horizon of an individual investor is short compared to the horizon of an institution, the potential improvement in Sharpe ratio offered by these investments justifies the loss of liquidity.

# Growth of Alternative Assets

Hedge funds, as an asset class, have seen the largest growth in recent years, from  \$263 billion in 2000 to over\$ 4 trillion in 2021. Venture capital and leveraged buyout funds dominate the private equity sector, and both have experienced rapid recent growth. For example, venture capital grew from \$225 billion in assets under management in 2000 to nearly \$1 trillion in 2021. Figure 26.1 demonstrates the growth of assets under management

Institutional investors, such as those that manage university endowments, foundations, and pension funds, have a fiduciary responsibility to the owners of those funds. This means they are legally obligated to act in good faith and trust on behalf of their clients' best interests, putting those interests ahead of even their own. The "prudent man rule" (since renamed the prudent person rule) was first applied to investments in the U.S. trust law case Harvard College v. Amory (1830), which required trustees to defend their investment decisions as prudent. But how does one define prudence?

After several false starts, Congress passed The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in 1974. This act greatly expanded the regulation of defined benefit retirement plans under the stewardship of three government agencies: the Internal Revenue Service, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and the Department of Labor. Among other requirements, ERISA mandated that prudence means, among other things, "... diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so. . . ." The original interpretation of this rule implied that high-volatility investments such as in start-ups (e.g., venture capital) and most derivatives (e.g., via hedge funds) would likely not be considered judicious and would violate the ERISA's fiduciary standard of care. Fund managers thus overweighted traditionally safer asset classes at the cost of performance.


This changed in June 1979, when the Department of Labor issued a clarification stating: "An investment decision should be judged with regard to the role the investment plays in the pension plan's overall portfolio." This means the volatility of an investment viewed as a stand-alone position need not render it injudicious; instead, investment risk needs to be assessed as part of a larger strategy of diversification across asset classes. Many "speculative" assets could be entirely prudent when part of a diversified portfolio. Further adding to the flexibility of this clarification, ERISA did not create a list of allowable or forbidden securities, implying that prudence is better defined within the context of each individual fund's circumstances.

The historic rise of alternative asset classes has many sources, but this clarification is perhaps the critical one. After 1979, it was considered judicious to allow for the inclusion of riskier asset classes such as hedge funds and private equity as a part of a broader asset allocation approach. Figure 26.1 shows the rapid increase in these sectors beginning roughly in 2003. A great diversity of capital sources, including pensions, endowments, foundations, and other investors, flooded into these alternative investments, profoundly changing the nature of performance and risk for their beneficiaries.

The nearby box discusses how the rapid expansion of this sector was facilitated by changes in regulations regarding the sorts of assets in which pension funds were allowed to invest.

# 26.2 Hedge Funds

The hedge fund universe encompasses a broad range of styles, making it difficult to treat these funds as a uniform asset class. Table 26.1 lists most of the common investment themes. Notice that many of these strategies do not actually hedge any particular risk. For example, long/short equity funds seek to generate abnormal returns by buying undervalued stocks and shorting overvalued ones. In contrast, market-neutral strategies also use long- short strategies but those funds seek to hedge exposure to market risk.

# Hedge Fund Strategies

Though diverse, hedge fund strategies generally fall into two categories: directional and nondirectional. Directional strategies are straightforward bets that one sector will outperform other sectors of the market.

<table><tr><td>Style</td><td>Strategy</td></tr><tr><td>Equity market neutral</td><td>Commonly uses long/short hedges. Typically controls for industry, sector, size, and other exposures and establishes market-neutral positions designed to exploit some market inefficiency. Typically deploys leverage to amplify inefficiencies.</td></tr><tr><td>Long/short equity hedge</td><td>Equity-oriented positions on either side of the market (i.e., long or short), depending on outlook. Not meant to be market neutral; low beta may be incidental. May establish a concentrated focus regionally (e.g., U.S. or Europe) or on a specific sector (e.g., tech or health care stocks). Derivatives may be used to hedge positions.</td></tr><tr><td>Dedicated short bias</td><td>Net short position, usually in equities, as opposed to pure short exposure. In recent years, the number of true dedicated short bias managers has dwindled.</td></tr><tr><td>Event driven</td><td>Attempts to profit from events such as mergers &amp; acquisitions (risk-arbitrage event driven), regulatory changes, restructurings, bankruptcies, and reorganizations (distressed event driven), or other litigation. Can invest across asset classes and events (multi-strategy event driven).</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed-income arbitrage</td><td>Attempts to profit from price anomalies in related interest rate securities. Includes interest rate swap arbitrage, U.S. versus non-U.S. government bond arbitrage, yield-curve arbitrage, and mortgage-backed arbitrage.</td></tr><tr><td>Convertible arbitrage</td><td>Hedged investing in convertible securities, typically long convertible bonds and short corresponding stock, particularly when there is a price discrepancy in the conversion ratio.</td></tr><tr><td>Global macro</td><td>Involves long and short positions in capital or derivative markets across the world. Portfolio positions reflect views on broad market conditions and major economic trends.</td></tr><tr><td>Emerging markets</td><td>Goal is to exploit market inefficiencies in emerging markets. Typically long only because short-selling is not feasible in many developing markets. Can be invested across asset classes (and currency).</td></tr><tr><td>Managed futures</td><td>Use financial, currency, or commodity futures. May make use of technical trading rules or a less structured judgmental approach.</td></tr><tr><td>Multistrategy</td><td>Opportunistic choice of strategy depending on outlook.</td></tr><tr><td>Fund of funds</td><td>Fund allocates its cash to several other hedge funds to be managed.</td></tr></table>

Hedge Fund Styles*

*Credit Suisse maintains one of the most comprehensive databases on hedge fund performance. It categorizes hedge funds into these different investment styles.

In contrast, nondirectional strategies are designed to exploit temporary misalignments in security valuations. For example, if the corporate bond yields seem abnormally high compared to Treasury bond yields, even after accounting for default risk, the hedge fund would buy corporate bonds and short sell Treasury securities. The fund is not betting on broad movements in the entire bond market—it buys one type of bond and sells another. By taking a long/short position, the fund hedges interest rate exposure while making a bet on the relative valuation across the two sectors. If yield spreads revert to their "normal" relationship, the fund profits from the realignment regardless of the general trend in interest rates. The bet is designed to be market neutral—or hedged—with respect to the direction of interest rates, which gives rise to the term "hedge fund."10

Nondirectional strategies are sometimes further divided into convergence or relative value positions. The difference between them is the certainty of the time horizon at which the mispricing resolves. An example of a convergence strategy would entail exploiting the mispricing of a futures contract that must be corrected by the time the contract matures. In contrast, the corporate versus Treasury spread we just discussed would be a relative value strategy because there is no obvious horizon during which the yield spread would "correct" from unusual levels.

# Example 26.1 Market Neutral Positions

Several hedge funds have deployed a market-neutral position using a strategy based on the following observation: Newly issued or "on-the-run" 30-year Treasury bonds regularly sell at higher prices (lower yields) than  $29 \frac{1}{2}$ -year bonds with almost identical duration. The yield spread presumably is a premium due to the greater liquidity of the on-the-run bonds. Hedge funds, with relatively low liquidity needs, buy the  $29 \frac{1}{2}$ -year bonds and sell the 30-year bonds. This position generates a profit if and when the yields on the two bonds converge, as typically happens when aging 30-year bonds are no longer the most liquid on-the-run bond and thus not priced at a premium.

This strategy should generate profits regardless of interest rate movements if 30-year bonds underperform the  $291/2$ -year bonds, as they should when the liquidity premium dissipates. Because the pricing discrepancies between these two securities almost necessarily must disappear at a given date, this strategy is an example of convergence arbitrage.

While the convergence date here is not quite as definite as the maturity of a futures contract, the current on-the-run T-bonds will lose that status when the Treasury issues its next 30-year bonds. In contrast, when security analysts think they have found a mispriced stock, they usually acknowledge that it is hard to know how long it will take for price to converge to intrinsic value.

Long-short positions such as in Example 26.1 are characteristic of hedged strategies. They are designed to isolate a bet on some mispricing without taking on market exposure. Profits are made regardless of broad market movements once prices "converge" or return to their "proper" levels. Hence, use of short positions and derivatives is part and parcel of the industry.

A more complex long-short strategy is convertible bond arbitrage, one of the more prominent sectors of the hedge-fund universe. A convertible bond may be viewed as a

Alfred W. Jones is generally credited with starting the first hedge fund in 1949, as well as creating the moniker, calling his product a "hedged fund." Jones, a sociologist and investor, believed he could identify undervalued and overvalued stocks. He pursued a strategy of buying stocks (with leverage) and hedging these positions with short sales. This approach minimized his portfolio beta, thus creating the first market-neutral hedge fund.

straight bond plus a call option on the underlying stock; the market-neutral strategy in this case involves a position in the bond offset by an opposite position in the stock. For example, if the convertible is viewed as underpriced, the fund will buy it and offset its resultant exposure to declines in the stock price by shorting the stock.

Although these market-neutral positions are hedged, they are not risk-free arbitrage strategies. Rather, they should be viewed as pure plays, that is, bets on particular (perceived) mispricing between two sectors or securities, with extraneous sources of risk such as general market exposure hedged away. Moreover, because the funds often operate with considerable leverage, returns can be quite volatile. While traditional asset classes diversify away idiosyncratic risk, hedge funds embrace it to drive abnormal returns while still eliminating systematic risk.

# Concept Check 26.1

Classify each of the following strategies of a hypothetical hedge fund as directional or nondirectional.

a. The fund buys shares in the India Investment Fund, a closed-end fund that is selling at a discount to net asset value, and sells the MSCI India Index Swap.
b. The fund purchases shares in ExxonMobil and sells short shares of Chevron.
c. The fund buys shares in Generic Pharmaceuticals, betting that it will be acquired at a premium by Pfizer.

# Statistical Arbitrage

Statistical arbitrage is a version of a market-neutral strategy, but one that merits its own discussion. It differs from pure arbitrage in that it does not exploit risk-free positions based on unambiguous mispricing (such as index arbitrage). Instead, it uses quantitative and often automated trading systems that seek out many temporary and modest misalignments in prices among securities. By taking relatively small positions in many of these opportunities, the law of averages makes the probability of profiting from the collection of apparently positive-value bets very high, ideally almost a "statistical certainty." Of course, this strategy presumes that the fund's modeling techniques can identify reliable, if small, market inefficiencies. The law of averages guarantees profits only if the expected return is positive!

Such rapid heavy trading requires extensive use of quantitative tools such as automated trading and mathematical algorithms to identify profit opportunities and efficient diversification across positions. These strategies require the fastest trading technology and the lowest possible trading costs. They would not be possible without the electronic communication networks discussed in Chapter 3.

One example of statistical arbitrage is pairs trading, in which stocks are paired up based on an analysis of either fundamental similarities or market exposures (betas). The general approach is to match similar companies whose returns are highly correlated but where one company seems to be priced more aggressively than the other.[11] Market-neutral positions can be formed by buying the relatively cheap firm and selling the expensive one. Many such pairs comprise the hedge fund's overall portfolio. Each pair may have an uncertain outcome, but with many such matched pairs, the presumption is that the large number of long-short bets will provide a very high probability of a positive abnormal return. More general versions of pairs trading allow for positions in clusters of stocks that may be relatively mispriced.


Statistical arbitrage is commonly associated with data mining, which refers to sorting through huge amounts of historical data to uncover systematic patterns in returns that can be exploited by traders. The risk of data mining, and statistical arbitrage in general, is that historical relationships may break down when fundamental economic conditions change or, indeed, that the apparent patterns in the data may be due to pure chance. Enough analysis applied to enough data is sure to produce apparent patterns that do not reflect real relationships that will persist in the future.

# High-Frequency Strategies

While statistical arbitrage is facilitated by rapid-trading technology, other hedge fund strategies are absolutely dependent on high-frequency trading. Here are just a few:

Electronic News Feeds Some funds have established electronic news feeds that give them instant access to breaking news such as earnings announcements. Utilizing computerized natural language processing, announcements can be instantly interpreted as good (or bad) news and buy (or sell) orders can be placed immediately. Clearly, the payoff for this sort of strategy depends on being among the first to respond to the news, which makes electronic trading and access to market servers essential.

Cross-Market Arbitrage Very-high-frequency traders can take advantage of temporary discrepancies in security prices across markets, buying in the market where the price is low and selling where it is high. This cross-market arbitrage requires the fastest-possible trading capabilities, as these opportunities are truly fleeting. A special case of this strategy would be index arbitrage (see Chapter 23), where the pricing inconsistency is between the futures and spot markets.

Electronic Market Making Some funds repeatedly post (but frequently cancel) bid and ask prices to profit from the bid-ask spread. Once those prices are posted, however, they are vulnerable to news events that move equilibrium prices outside their bid-ask bounds. If a company is mentioned in a news report, for example, the fund may immediately cancel its posted prices. In this regard, the strategy overlaps with the electronic news feeds mentioned above.

Electronic “Front Running” In this strategy, firms use data on the stream of trades as well as some version of artificial intelligence to infer whether other traders are generally buying or selling. If they conclude other traders are buying, for example, they will also put in a buy order, attempting to purchase shares before other traders have moved the price.

# Portable Alpha

An important implication of the market-neutral pure play is portable alpha. Suppose an investor speculates on a stock thought to be underpriced but believes the market is about to fall. Even if the stock is relatively underpriced, it still might decline in response to declines in the broad market. The investor wants to separate the stock-specific bet from the exposure to the broad market that arises because the stock's beta is positive. The solution is to buy the stock and eliminate the market exposure by selling enough index futures to drive overall beta to zero. This long stock–short futures strategy generates a pure play or, equivalently, a market-neutral position on the stock.


More generally, this is an investment strategy to separate asset allocation from security selection. The idea is to invest wherever alpha can be found, then hedge the systematic risk of that investment to isolate the alpha from its asset market exposure, and, finally, establish whatever exposure to broad market sectors is desired by using passive products such as indexed mutual funds, ETFs, or index futures. This strategy separates the search for alpha from the choice of which market sectors the portfolio ultimately is exposed to. We therefore call it portable alpha. Example 26.2 illustrates. This procedure is also called alpha transfer because the alpha can be transferred from one sector to another or even to another asset class. Finding alpha requires skill. By contrast, beta, or market exposure, is a "standardized commodity" that can be supplied cheaply through index products and does not add value.

# Example 26.2 A Pure Play

You manage a \$2.5 million portfolio. You simultaneously believe it will generate positive alpha ( $\alpha > 0$ ), but the overall market is about to fall. Therefore, you use Equation 26.1 to establish a pure play on the perceived  $\alpha$ . The portfolio return equals its "fair" CAPM return, plus firm-specific risk (e), plus the perceived mispricing ( $\alpha$ ):

$$ r _ {\text {p o r t f o l i o}} = r _ {f} + \beta \left(r _ {M} - r _ {f}\right) + \alpha + e \tag {26.1}
$$

Suppose  $\beta = 1.20$ ,  $\alpha = .02$ ,  $r_f = .01$ , and the S&P 500 index is currently  $S_0 = 4,000$ . For simplicity, assume the portfolio pays no dividends. You can capture the positive alpha of  $2\%$  per month and hedge away the beta exposure of 1.20 by selling a sufficient number of the liquid E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts (with a multiplier of 50), hedged for one month:

$$
\text {H e d g e r a t i o} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 2 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0}{4 , 0 0 0 \times \mathbb {S} 5 0} \times 1. 2 0 = 1 5 \text {c o n t r a c t s}
$$

The dollar value of the stock portfolio after one month will be:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \$ 2,500,000 \times (1 + r _ {\text {p o r t f o l i o}}) = \$ 2,500,000 \times [ 1 + . 0 1 + 1. 2 \times (r _ {m} - . 0 1) + . 0 2 + e ] \\ = \$ 2,545,000 + \$ 3,000,000 \times r _ {M} + \$ 2,500,000 \times e \\ \end{array}
$$

The dollar proceeds from your futures position in one month will be:

Contracts  $\times$  Multiplier  $\times (F_0 - F_1)$
= 15 × 50 × [F₀ - S₁] Mark to market on 15 contracts sold
= \ 750 \times [S_0 \times 1.01 - S_1] Substitute for futures prices from parity relationship
= \ 750 \times [S_0 \times 1.01 - S_0 \times (1 + r_M)] Because S_{1} = S_{0} \times (1 + r_{M}) when no dividends are paid
= \ 750 \times [4,000 \times (.01 - r_M)] Because S_0 = 4,000
$= \$  30,000 - \ $3,000,000 \times r_{M}$  Simplify

Combining these two proceeds, the final value of the hedged position is:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {H e d g e d p r o c e e d s} = \text {V a l u e o f s t o c k p o r t i f i o} + \text {F u t u r e s p r o c e e d s} \tag {26.2} \\ = \$ 2,545,000 + \$ 3,000,000 \times r _ {M} + \$ 2,500,000 \times e \\ + \mathbb {S} 3 0, 0 0 0 - \mathbb {S} 3, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 \times r _ {M} \\ = \$ 2,575,000 + \$ 2,500,000 \times e \\ \end{array}
$$

The exposure to the market from the futures position precisely offsets the exposure from the stock portfolio. You have therefore reduced  $\beta$  to 0. Your total return (above the original \$2.5 million investment) is \$75,000 plus the nonsystematic risk. That represents a  $3\%$  expected return on the portfolio, which equals the risk-free rate plus alpha.

A warning: Even hedged market-neutral positions can go very wrong. This is not true arbitrage (defined by the creation of riskless excess returns) because profits still depend on the accuracy of your analysis (perceived alpha). Moreover, a sound strategy can be done in by simple bad luck—the analysis may be correct, but a bad realization of firm-specific risk (a large negative value of  $e$  in Equation 26.2) can still result in losses.[13]

Even market-neutral bets result in considerable volatility because most hedge funds use significant leverage. Incidents of relative mispricing are fairly minor, and the hedged nature of these long-short strategies make the volatility of the pure play low. Hedge funds respond by scaling up their bets. This amplifies gains when their bets work out, but also amplifies losses. In the end, the volatility of the funds is not small.

# 26.3 Venture Capital and Angel Investors

Private equity distinguishes itself as an investable asset class by the type of assets under management. Whether start-ups or public-turned-private corporations, private equity assets are not traded on centralized securities markets such as the NYSE or NASDAQ. Ownership is closely held and changes infrequently. We examine three major categories of private equity—angel investors, venture capital, and leveraged buyouts—though Table 26.2 hints at the variety of the private equity universe. For all private equity firms, the relationship with portfolio companies is temporary. They buy, improve, and then sell or “harvest” those companies through either an acquisition or, hopefully, an IPO. Angel investors and venture capital provide capital infusions for start-ups in exchange for ownership positions.

# Angel Investors

Angel investors are wealthy individuals or families. They can invest on their own or through angel networks, such as Tech Coast Angels, Keiretsu Forum, or CommonAngels. These networks match angels to entrepreneurs. The networks thus diversify angels' portfolios and broaden due diligence. Angels typically invest at the earliest stages of business development; they are often the first infusion of capital after the founders. They commonly invest between  \$50,000 and\$ 100,000, though the amount can vary considerably.

Categories of Private Equity*

The process of receiving funding may differ according to each angel, though a typical pattern emerges. Entrepreneurs submit an application, and a screening process eliminates businesses that do not meet certain requirements such as size, industry, geographic region, strategic fit, or other characteristics. Entrepreneurs who make it past the initial screening meet with the angel to present the business model and, if available, a business plan. At this point, the entrepreneurs present the case for funding. If the angel wishes to proceed, due diligence is the next step.

Angel investors recognize that most start-ups fail, so they demand very high expected rates of return (contingent on success) to justify taking on that risk. Because positive free cash flows are rarely present at this point in the start-up's life cycle, discounted cash flow models like the ones developed in Chapter 18 will not be effective in computing value. The angel relies on other valuation models (see Example 26.3 below) to establish acceptable initial funding levels and required ownership.

# Venture Capital

Venture capital (VC) firms are professionally managed money managers that focus on startups. They generally take two forms: The first are independent venture capital funds, such as Kleiner-Perkins, Sequoia Capital, and General Catalyst, which act as stand-alone investment firms. The second, corporate venture capital, is part of a larger corporation and may be viewed as the start-up investment arm of major corporations. Notable examples such as Intel Capital and Google Ventures invest both within as well as outside the parent company's industry.

VCs are typically structured as limited liability partnerships (LLPs) that match general partners (GPs) with limited partners (LPs). GPs control the funds under management, source deals, conduct due diligence, and finance, monitor, and harvest these investments through exits. The LPs provide capital but have limited involvement in the day-to-day operation of the firm, a requirement to maintain their limited liability status. Capital committed by the LPs is used or "drawn down" by the GPs to invest in the start-up companies; at exit, profits are shared between the GPs and LPs.

# Venture Capital and Investment Stages

From its conception as an idea, a business grows through several stages of development. Figure 26.2, Panel A, presents a typical "J-curve" describing start-up growth and cash flow over time. As a start-up begins developing an initial product or service, free cash flows are typically negative, and may remain so for several years. After an entrepreneur has exhausted the capital supplied by friends, family, and angel investors, seed capital marks the first infusion of venture capital. Seed capital focuses primarily on refining the business model, building the prototype of the product, possibly bringing it to market, and beginning to build the entrepreneurial team.

Figure 26.2 Venture Capital Life Cycles; Panel A, Startup life cycle; Panel B, Venture Capital Fund Life Cycle Source (Panel B): Frank Fabozzi, Handbook of Finance Volume 1 (Wiley, 2008) p. 570.


As the business grows and its market share increases, cash flow improves, eventually turning positive. Investments by early-stage venture capital help move prototypes into markets and continue to help develop the firm's operations, including shoring up any management deficiencies. The first and second rounds of VC funding, called A & B rounds, are typically considered early-stage venture capital. Both seed capital and early-stage venture capital focus on operational and corporate governance improvements as well as providing financing.

Rapid expansion of the firm may result in a "cash crunch," where the firm's revenue and profits grow rapidly, but its free cash flow lags. This may reflect weak bargaining power as well as fewer options to raise additional capital. Late-stage venture capital invests in these later rounds, typically C & D, to ameliorate any cash crunch and to further expand the start-up, with an increasing eye towards exit. Late-stage VCs put a greater emphasis on financing, though some operational improvements undoubtedly occur.

# Fund Life Cycle

The vintage year is the first year of the venture fund, typically when raised capital is first deployed. A fund's lifespan is typically 10-12 years. Figure 26.2, Panel B, illustrates the relationship between time and fund value. A fund begins its life by raising capital; GPs meet with potential LPs to build a case for funding. In 2020, the average fund size was  \$229 million, but the median fund size was smaller, at\$ 75 million. Mega-funds, such as those raised by Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global Management, exceed 1 billion and pull the average away from the median.[16]

One venture capital firm will likely have several funds, often running simultaneously. Often the LPs have committed capital to previous funds, and it is common to see one LP invested in multiple funds of the same venture capital firm. Re-upping investments with proceeds from previous funds can be viewed as analogous to reinvesting dividends.

Once capital is raised, the VCs begin identifying start-ups and conducting due diligence. When selecting deals, VCs will look at the business model, the product or technology, and the management team. A survey of VCs shows that management team  $(47\%)$  is the most important consideration when sourcing a deal, outranking the business model  $(10\%)$  and even the actual product  $(13\%)!^{17}$

At the conclusion of successful due diligence, the VC and the entrepreneur draw up a term sheet, or written agreement specifying the deal structure. Details of the agreement include stock type, dividends, voting rights, capital invested, ownership, liquidation preferences, anti-dilution measures (so future rounds of financing do not eliminate VC ownership), and any other protective provisions for both parties. Money is then drawn down from the fund's committed capital and invested into the start-up.

Because there is an inherent information asymmetry between the VC and the founder who actually runs the start-up, the VC must monitor the entrepreneur's spending. An entrepreneur, flush with cash from a round of financing, may not exhibit discipline in cash expenditures. The technology boom of the late 1990s provides many examples of excessive venture cash consumption, or burn rate. Venture funding flooded technology companies, often without imposing necessary discipline on the entrepreneurs, and many LP dollars were lost. These agency costs are associated with newer start-ups and start-ups that rely heavily on intangible assets and R&D in general.[18]

Higher agency costs imply higher monitoring costs. One effective monitoring solution is staged financing—disbursing committed capital in smaller infusions over time. This allows the financiers to monitor burn rates, infuse fiscal discipline, and redirect capital away from start-ups that are failing. Even with this financial discipline, Figure 26.3 demonstrates growth in average deal size, sorted by VC stage.

Successful exits from portfolio companies generate returns for venture capitalists and their limited partners and represent the end of the fund's life. There are three types of exits: initial public offerings (IPOs), acquisitions, and write-offs. IPO exits are typically the most profitable and therefore most desired of the exits. The median venture fund exits through IPO about  $20 - 30\%$  of the time.[19]

Acquisitions (and mergers) account for about  $25 - 37\%$  of exits. Typically, a larger firm acquires the start-up, either to eliminate emerging competition or to acquire a target firm's research and development expertise. The remaining exits are liquidations and subsequent write-offs. Liquidation value is rarely sufficient to cover outstanding liabilities, so write-offs typically generate returns on invested capital of  $-100\%$ .

Notice the similarity in shape between Figure 26.2 Panels A and B. This is no coincidence. The long period of negative cash flows ultimately followed by positive ones demonstrates that the fund life cycle parallels the firm life cycle.

# Private Equity Valuation

A challenging task for all private equity investors is the determination of value. For the VC, value determines the required ownership per dollar invested. Entrepreneurs face the converse problem—ownership given up per dollar invested. While underlying laws of supply and demand still apply, our "go-to" models like the Capital Asset Pricing Model and the Dividend Discount Model are not easily implemented in this arena. Private equity does not enjoy high-volume trading where buyers and sellers arrive at equilibrium prices. This makes valuation imprecise, inaccurate, and inefficient compared to public markets (though the public market equivalent method is promising for benchmarking; it compares private equity to similarly risked public equity).

Despite these challenges, there are some battle-worn approaches used by fund managers to approximate initial required ownership. Entrepreneurship is inherently risky, and VCs require a high potential rate of return to justify that risk. One popular approach is based on a capital multiplier, that is, the projected terminal value of a start-up expressed as a multiple of the VC's initial investment. That multiplier also determines the fractional ownership a VC may demand of the start-up.

The VC's ownership share at the time of exit is the ratio of its final value (which is forecasted as the initial investment times a capital multiplier) to the expected total value of the firm at that time:

$$
\text {T e r m i n a l} = \frac {\text {I n i t i a l} \times \text {C a p i t a l} \text {m u l t i p l i e r}}{\text {F o r c a s t} \text {t e r m i n a l} \text {v a l u e}} \tag {26.3}
$$

However, if the VC anticipates dilution of its ownership share due to future rounds of financing, its initial share must be higher than this terminal share. Example 26.3 illustrates both the baseline calculation as well as the impact of dilution in future rounds. These calculations rely on highly uncertain forecasts. Incomplete information, lack of transparency, and lack of an active market of willing buyers and sellers create great imprecision. The final value will almost certainly not equal the initial calculations.

# Example 26.3 VC Equity Share and Dilution

You are an early-stage venture capitalist conducting due diligence on a biotech start-up. You are willing to contribute  $2,000,000 (v_{\text{Initial}})$  in the first round of financing, and you target a final exit value of  $10 \times$  Initial capital. You estimate exit to take place (roughly) in eight years. You expect an additional round of financing in four years in which you will not participate that will dilute your ownership share to  $50\%$ . You project that the firm can be sold for  $\$ 90,000,000$  ( $v_{\text{Terminal}}$ ) in eight years. What equity position must you require for your investment? What must be your initial valuation of the company excluding the amount of your investment?

To find the required equity position, let us work back from the terminal valuation. Your terminal ultimate ownership share of the firm,  $w_{\text{Terminal}}$ , must be your targeted dollar payout expressed as a fraction of the total terminal value of the firm. Using the return requirement (the capital multiplier) and the projected terminal value of 90,000,000, this ratio is:


$$
W _ {\text {Terminal}} = \frac {V _ {\text {Initial}} \times \text {Capital multiplier}}{V _ {\text {Terminal}}} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 2,000,000 \times 10}{\mathbb {S} 90,000,000} = . 2 2 2 2, \text {or} 2 2. 2 2
$$

This baseline calculation thus implies a required ownership share of  $22.22\%$  at the time of exit.

However, you believe there will be at least one round of financing between your initial commitment and final value. Because your initial ownership share will be diluted by  $50\%$ , your initial ownership position,  $w_{\text{initial}}$ , must be:

$$ w _ {\text {Initial}} = \frac {w _ {\text {Terminal}}}{1 - \text {Dilution}} = \frac {.2222}{1 - .50} = .4444, \text {or} 44.44 \%
$$

Using this initial ownership share and your initial investment ( \$2 million), you can now back out the post-round valuation of the firm. The value of the firm after you make your investment (the post-round value) must be enough to equate the value of your ownership share to the\$ 2 million you are investing:

$$ w _ {\text {I n i t i a l}} \times v _ {\text {I n i t i a l}} = . 4 4 4 4 \times v _ {\text {I n i t i a l}} = \$ 2 \text {m i l l o n}
$$

$$ v _ {\text {I n i t i a l}} = \$ 2 \text {m i l l o n / . 4 4 4 4} = \$ 4. 5 \text {m i l l o n}
$$

This implies that the value of the firm net of your \$2 million investment (i.e., the pre-round valuation) must be \$4.5 million – \$2.0 million = \$2.5 million.

a. What is the initial ownership required if there are two subsequent rounds of financing, diluting initial shares by  $25\%$  each round?
b. What is the initial ownership if the VC commits to investing sufficient capital in every subsequent round to maintain the initial  $22.22\%$  ownership share?

# Venture Syndication

Like IPO underwriters, venture capitalists often syndicate with one another. There are several reasons for this. First, if a fund extends an offer to syndicate to another VC, it hopes for reciprocity in the future. Syndication also acts as a signaling mechanism—because start-ups are extremely risky, pooled investments signal widespread optimism about the potential for good exits[20] and allow for the addition of sector-specific expertise. Such expertise can be distributed across the syndicate, providing a convenient way to diversify otherwise concentrated portfolios.[21]

If syndication allows better deal sourcing and better monitoring, then it should result in better fund performance and a higher percentage of funds that successfully exit.

Hochberg et al.[22] demonstrate that syndication does predict better fund outcomes, measured in terms of the number and quality of relationships as well as internal rate of return. In addition, at every round of financing, syndication improves the probability of the firm surviving to the next round. Finally, VCs that syndicate generate higher rates of IPOs and acquisitions for their portfolio companies. Well-connected venture capitalists lead to better results, particularly when they team up with other well-connected VCs.

# Venture Capital and Innovation

Besides technology, what do Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Intel, Microsoft, and Yahoo! have in common? They were all venture-capital-backed start-ups. Nearly half of all FDA-approved drugs in the last decade began with venture funding.[23] Does private equity engender innovation, or does innovation cause capital to flow to angels and VCs? This was one of the unanswered questions in the 2001 field-shaping research of Gompers and Lerner.[24] Since then, the flow of causality has been clarified considerably for both venture capital and angels.

One study showed that angel investing has a causal impact on the performance of start-ups.[25] The impact stems from a combination of intense monitoring, value-added services, and structured control rights (anti-dilution measures) that protect the ability of the angel to continue to influence the development of the firm. The authors compare otherwise similar angel- and non-angel-backed start-ups. Start-ups with a critical mass of angel backing are more likely to survive at least four years and have a successful exit. These firms have more employees, hold more patents, and grow faster. Angel-funded companies obtain better financing in later rounds and are more likely to connect with syndicated venture funding.

Like angel-backed start-ups, VC-backed firms are associated with significantly higher levels of intellectual property. Kortum and Lerner $^{26}$  show that increased venture activity is associated with a rise in patent rates. They show that the inflow of VC funding is associated with improved industrial innovation. They also observe the impact of venture capital on the patent-research and development (R&D) ratio (patents issued per dollar of R&D) and find that a dollar of venture funding is three times more likely to generate a patent than a dollar of traditional corporate R&D. While VC funding was only about  $3\%$  of corporate R&D, it generated  $8\%$  of patents from 1983-1992.

Since the 1990s, the influence of VCs on innovation has only increased. Gornall and Strebulaev[27] concluded that venture capital-backed companies account for  $62\%$  of publicly traded U.S. companies' R&D spending and  $41\%$  of total market capitalization. VCs were early investors in  $20\%$  of the 300 largest U.S. public companies. Lerner and Nanda[28] show that

venture capital funded almost half of all firms that eventually went public. Of the 4,109 IPOs between 1995 and 2019 that they reviewed,  $47\%$  had venture funding. Additionally,  $57\%$  of VC-backed firms were still publicly traded in 2019. In contrast, the public survival rate for non-venture-backed IPOs for that period was only  $21\%$ .

However, Lerner and Nanda caution that venture capital may be optimized for a "narrow slice of technological innovation." Specifically, the standard 10-year fund life fits well with the life cycle of software and other technologies with relatively short development times. As new industries take center stage, will they shape the way VCs structure their funds or will altogether new investment vehicles emerge to support different forms of innovation? It is uncertain if we are at the zenith of venture capital's role in creating innovation or if there is still room to grow.

# 26.4 Leveraged Buyout Funds

While angels and venture capitalists invest in start-ups, leveraged buyout funds (LBOs) operate on the other side of a company's life cycle. Private equity firms such as KKR, Blackstone, and Warburg Pincus seek publicly traded firms with stable cash flows that may be underperforming. LBOs use massive amounts of debt to finance the purchase of all the publicly traded firm's equity. The public firm is now privately owned by the LBO, whose intent is to improve governance, operations, and financial structure. Like angels and VCs, LBOs seek an exit through an IPO or acquisition, typically within five to seven years of the initial purchase.

# Leveraged Buyout Firm Structure

Also like VC funds, LBO funds are typically organized as limited partnerships with a typical fund life of 10 years, though extensions can be written into the limited partnership agreement. The fund operates as a closed-end vehicle, with all the illiquidity that entails. Limited partners who supply capital to the fund include the usual suspects: institutional investors and wealthy individuals.[29] GPs control how committed capital is invested subject to some protective covenants. For example, the maximum percent of the total fund that can be invested in any one company may be limited.

# The Deal

LBOs seem to target companies with some common characteristics. They are often mature companies with reasonably stable cash flows, though they may be currently underperforming. Targets are at a stage of development where there are relatively limited capital expenditures, the capital structure does not heavily favor debt, and many of the assets are marketable. Other factors, like barriers to entry, threat of substitution, regulatory risk, and historical performance, may provide insight into the firm (Chapter 17 discusses some of these factors). These characteristics have one important feature in common: debt capacity, or the potential to generate sufficient cash flow to pay down the leverage taken on by the LBO in the purchase.

Once the LBO fund identifies a target, it will make an offer on the outstanding stock, typically at a premium of  $15 - 50\%$  over the current stock price.[30] The offer is funded by about  $10 - 40\%$  equity drawn down from the fund and  $60 - 90\%$  debt (the leverage).

The debt will typically include a mixture of senior and secured debt as well as junior and unsecured debt, often in the form of high-yield bonds.

When the fund takes control of the firm, the control structure shifts drastically. While public ownership is widely dispersed among shareholders, private ownership is highly concentrated. This provides formidable incentives for success. The highly levered position forces an environment of fiscal discipline: Sufficient EBITDA must be generated to cover the debt service. The very structure of the deal seeks to minimize agency problems, which should lead to leaner, more profitable operations.

The LBO fund attempts to implement structural changes that improve the odds of a successful exit. The firm will work with management (old or new, depending on the specifics of the buyout) to improve governance. The heavy debt burden forces managers to be fiscally prudent. LBOs encourage productivity improvements through merit-based compensation, promotions, and hiring. The aims comprise the twin goals of growth and debt reduction. If successful, they will generate higher equity value realized at exit, as Example 26.4 illustrates.

# Example 26.4 Measuring LBO Returns

Lexington & Goldman (L&G) is a buyout fund that wishes to purchase a regional telecom firm. This firm generates steady cash flows but has recently fallen on hard times. The stock currently trades at \$42 per share with 20,000,000 shares outstanding. L&G offers \$50 per share to purchase the company outright. The offer is funded by 25\% equity from L&G's committed capital and 75\% by high-yield debt securities. The LBO believes it can work with management to grow the firm at a rate of about 6\% while reducing the proportion of capital structure composed of debt by 5 percentage points each year. The fund hopes to exit by the sixth year.

While equity originally accounts for only  $25\%$  of capital structure, by year 6 that value is expected to rise to  $25\% + 6 \times 5\% = 55\%$ . Figure 26.4 shows capital structure in a few select years.

What is the expected IRR of this investment? First, we calculate the value of the firm in year 6, accounting for its expected  $6\%$  growth rate:

$$
V _ {0} = \ 5 0 \times 2 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 = \ 1, 0 0 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0
$$

$$
V _ {6} = \\mathbb {1}, 0 0 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 \times 1. 0 6 ^ {6} = \\mathbb {1}, 4 1 8, 5 1 9, 1 1 2
$$

To find the IRR of the LBO investment, we derive the expected value of equity in year 6. The firm will be worth  $V_{6} = \1,418,519,112$  and the equity share of capital structure is forecast at 55\%, implying equity value of  $.55 \times \$ 1,418,519,112 = \$780,185,512 . These inputs allow us to solve for the LBO's internal rate of return:

$$
E _ {0} = \frac {E _ {T}}{(1 + I R R) ^ {T}}
$$

The discounted value of the future equity position

$$
\$ 250,000,000 = \frac {\$ 780 , 1 8 5 , 5 1 2}{(1 + I R R) ^ {6}}
$$

Solve for the internal rate of return

$$
I R R = 20.89 \%
$$

Why do LBOs use massive amounts of debt in their acquisitions? Suppose an LBO acquires a firm for  \$25,000,000 and exits five years later by selling the firm for\$ 48,000,000. Find the IRR for debt-to-equity ratios of  $D / E = 0$ , 1, and 4 in the initial investment. For simplicity, assume the final amount of debt equals the initial value of debt (in other words, only debt service was being paid annually during the term of the investment).

# Exits

The goal of the LBO is a successful exit from each of its privately held firms through either an IPO or acquisition. If the now-private firm exits LBO ownership by IPO, it does so as a new firm, legally distinct from its previous public identity. For the period of 1970-2007, about  $14\%$  of exits were by IPO.[31] However, this average has fallen from the highs in the 1980s. IPO exits are highly dependent on the strength of the broader IPO market.

Kaplan and Strömberg calculate about  $38\%$  of LBO portfolio companies are sold to a strategic buyer (a more traditional acquisition), while  $24\%$  are acquired in a second buyout. Around  $1\%$  are sold to their management (in a so-called management buyout) and  $5\%$  to another LBO-backed firm. About  $6\%$  declare bankruptcy and the rest have unknown fates because data collection is inherently challenging in this arena.

# Leveraged Buyouts and Innovation

In 1989, Michael Jensen published an important article titled "Eclipse of the Public Corporation," where he laid out a compelling case for the advantages of private equity (among other nonpublic organizations) over publicly traded firms. He cited as beneficial the concentration of ownership, stricter governance, stronger fiscal discipline engendered by a debt-heavy capital structure, and the subsequent decrease in agency problems. These characteristics would, he argued, lead to improved "operating efficiency, employee productivity, and shareholder value." The article was published at the height of the LBO boom in the 1980s, but just a few short years later, the high-yield bond market crashed, reducing LBO presence for many years. However, markets ebb and flow, including the market for leveraged buyouts.

Does a strong LBO market stimulate innovation in a similar manner as venture capital? A 2011 study by Lerner et al.33 concludes that private equity capital is followed

These findings suggest that LBOs refocus a company on its original areas of expertise, fortifying its comparative advantages while increasing value and innovation.

# 26.5 Performance Measurement for Alternative Investment Funds

Performance measurement and benchmarking for alternative assets are more challenging than for traditional asset classes. The closely held nature of alternative investments, combined with illiquidity and several reporting biases, muddy performance measures.

# Liquidity and Performance

One of the more important extensions of the CAPM allows for the possibility of a return premium for investors willing to hold less-liquid assets.[35] Compared to traditional mutual funds, alternative asset investors tend to hold more illiquid assets, either by strategy (e.g., hedge funds) or by nature (e.g., venture capital). Additionally, restrictions such as lock-up provisions, which are a time period in which LPs cannot redeem or sell invested capital, increase illiquidity. Therefore, part of the performance of alternative investment funds potentially reflects liquidity premia. If ignored, compensation for illiquidity may appear as true alpha (risk-adjusted abnormal returns). As we will now see, the evidence suggests that these premia are not trivial.

Liquidity and Hedge Fund Performance Aragon demonstrates that hedge funds with lock-up restrictions tend to hold less liquid portfolios. When he controlled for lock-ups or other share restrictions (such as redemption notice periods), the apparently positive average alpha of those funds turned insignificant. Aragon's work suggests that part of any "alpha" exhibited by hedge funds may be an equilibrium liquidity premium rather than a sign of stock-picking ability—a "fair" reward for providing liquidity to other investors.

Positive serial correlation means that positive returns are more likely to be followed by positive than by negative returns, a pattern often taken as an indicator of less liquid markets for the following reason. When prices are not available because an asset is not actively traded, the hedge fund must estimate its value to calculate net asset value and rates of return. However, such procedures are at best imperfect. As demonstrated by Getmansky, Lo, and Makarov,[37] they tend to result in serial correlation in prices as firms either smooth out their value estimates or only gradually mark prices to true market values. Positive serial correlation is therefore often interpreted as evidence of liquidity problems; in nearly efficient markets with frictionless trading, we would expect serial correlation or other predictable patterns in prices to be minimal.

34The authors argue that "citations either to or by the patent . . . are extremely important in patent filings, since they serve as 'property markers' . . ."

Hasanhodzic and  $\mathrm{Lo}^{38}$  find that hedge fund returns generally tend to exhibit significant serial correlation. This evidence of price smoothing has two important implications. First, it lends further support to the hypothesis that hedge funds hold less liquid assets and that part of their average returns may reflect liquidity premiums. Second, it implies that their risk-adjusted performance measures are upward-biased because any smoothing in the estimates of portfolio value will reduce measured volatility (thereby increasing the Sharpe ratio) as well as measured covariances and, therefore, betas with systematic factors (thereby increasing measured risk-adjusted alphas).

While Aragon focuses on the average level of liquidity,  $\text{Sadka}^{39}$  addresses the liquidity risk of hedge funds. He shows that exposure to unexpected declines in market liquidity is an important determinant of average hedge fund returns and that the spread in average returns across the funds with the highest and lowest liquidity exposure may be as much as  $6\%$  annually. Hedge fund performance may therefore reflect significant compensation for liquidity risk; see Figure 26.5 for a graphical representation.

Performance can be even more difficult to interpret if a hedge fund takes advantage of illiquid markets to manipulate returns by purposely misvaluing illiquid assets. On average, reported hedge fund returns in December have been substantially greater than average returns in other months.[40] The pattern is stronger for lower-liquidity funds and funds that are near or beyond the threshold return at which performance incentive fees kick in. It appears that some funds use their discretion in valuing assets to move returns to December to enhance their annual incentive fees. It also seems that some hedge funds attempt to manipulate their measured performance by buying additional shares in stocks they already own to push up prices.[41] The buying takes place just before market close at the end of the

month when hedge fund performance is reported. Moreover, the effort is concentrated in less liquid stocks where the price impact would be expected to be greater. If, as these papers suggest, funds take advantage of illiquid markets to manage returns, then accurate performance measurement becomes almost impossible.

Liquidity and Private Equity Several features contribute to the illiquidity of LBO and VC investments. Portfolio companies take years to develop and mature. Because the securities held are not traded in any public market, the exit itself is also an illiquid process whether by acquisition, secondary buyout, or IPO. Even after the exit, there are often covenants in the IPO offering to spread out the actual sale of the now-public securities by the private equity fund.

This illiquidity, combined with management and incentive fees (discussed below), implies that GPs need to generate considerable returns to sufficiently compensate their LPs on a risk-adjusted basis. Accounting for typical management and incentive fees and the liquidity premium over equivalent public securities, private equity fund managers need to generate between  $2.06\%$  and  $3.08\%$  alpha per year to adequately compensate investors.[42]

# Survivorship Bias and Backfill Bias

Because hedge funds and private equity are not compelled to report performance to the SEC (and therefore the public), two important biases may distort reported returns. Survivorship bias arises when unsuccessful funds that cease operation stop reporting returns and exit a database, leaving behind the performance only of successful funds. The effect is potentially large; for example, Malkiel and Saha[43] find that attrition rates for hedge funds are commonly more than double the attrition rate of mutual funds. Estimates of survivorship bias in various studies are typically substantial, in the range of  $2 - 4\%$ .[44]

Backfill bias arises when fund managers fail to report returns on all funds to database publishers. Funds started with seed capital eventually will open to the public. But they enter standard databases only if their past performance is deemed sufficiently successful to attract clients. Thus, prior performance of funds that find their way into the sample may not be representative of typical performance. Like survivorship bias, the effects of this bias can be large. Malkiel and Saha estimate returns were  $5\%$  higher when including backfilled data.

# Tail Events

Imagine a hedge fund's entire investment strategy is to hold an S&P 500 index fund and write deep out-of-the-money put options on it. The strategy brings in a modest premium from the written puts, which contributes to total performance. Only rarely will these puts impose a loss. While market crashes like the one in October 1987 may result in losses of multiples of the entire cumulative gain, if luck allows the fund to avoid these rare but extreme tail events,[45] the strategy appears gilded. The fund manager brings no skill to the

job, but investment results over limited periods might fool an investor into thinking that the manager is extremely talented. The problem in interpreting strategies with such exposure is that crashes or other extreme tail events occur very infrequently, so decades of results may be needed to fully appreciate their true risk and reward attributes.

In three influential books, Nassim Taleb, $^{46}$  a hedge fund operator himself, argues that many hedge funds are analogous to our hypothetical manager, racking up fame and fortune through strategies that make money most of the time but expose investors to rare but extreme losses. Taleb uses the metaphor of the black swan to discuss the importance of highly improbable, but highly impactful, events. $^{47}$  Taleb argues that black swans shape the world, and they simply could not have been predicted from the range of accumulated experience to date. The October 1987 crash, the financial crisis of 2008-2009, and the economic fallout of the COVID pandemic might be viewed as black swans—most market observers would have dismissed them as virtually impossible beforehand, but all three were highly impactful. These events caution investors to show humility when relying on past experience to evaluate future risk. Example 26.5 illustrates.

# Example 26.5 Tail Events and Long Term Capital Management

In the late 1990s, Long Term Capital Management was widely viewed as the most successful hedge fund in history. It had consistently provided double-digit returns to its investors, and it had earned hundreds of millions of dollars in incentive fees for its managers. The firm used sophisticated statistical models to estimate correlations across assets and believed that its capital was almost 10 times the annual standard deviation of its portfolio returns, presumably enough to withstand any "possible" shock to capital (at least, assuming normal distributions!).

But in the summer of 1998, things went badly. On August 17, 1998, Russia defaulted on its sovereign debt and threw capital markets into chaos. LTCM's 1-day loss on August 21 was \$550 million (approximately nine times its estimated monthly standard deviation). Total losses in August were about \$1.3 billion, despite the fact that LTCM believed that most of its positions were market-neutral relative-value trades. Losses accrued on virtually all of its positions, flying in the face of the presumed diversification of the overall portfolio.

How did this happen? The answer lies in the massive flight to quality and, even more so, to liquidity that was set off by the Russian default. LTCM was typically a seller of liquidity (holding less liquid assets, selling more liquid assets with lower yields, and earning the yield spread) and suffered huge losses. This was a different type of shock from those that appeared in its historical sample/modeling period. In the liquidity crisis that engulfed asset markets, the unexpected commonality of liquidity risk across usually uncorrelated asset classes became obvious. Losses that seemed statistically impossible on past experience had in fact come to pass; LTCM fell victim to a black swan.

# Historical Hedge Fund Performance

Figure 26.6 shows the performance of several hedge fund strategies using the S&P 500 as a benchmark. Panel A presents a "differential Sharpe ratio" equal to each strategy's Sharpe ratio minus that of S&P 500 over four consecutive but nonoverlapping 5-year periods starting in 2002.

In their experience, the black swan was outside the realm of reasonable possibility—in statistical jargon, an extreme outlier relative to their sample of observations.

While Sharpe ratios in the initial period (2002-2006) were excellent, nearly every strategy since then has exhibited far lower or even negative differential risk-adjusted returns. Accounting for possible value smoothing (which can produce upward bias in both Sharpe ratios and alphas), actual performance may have been even worse than the disappointing outcomes reported in Panel A.

Of course, it usually will be inappropriate to judge hedge fund performance using Sharpe ratios. These funds are not intended to be candidates for the investor's complete portfolio, but rather are almost always part of a larger collection of investments. Therefore, Panel B displays alphas and Panel C information ratios. These results paint performance in a much better light. Most alphas (and therefore information ratios) are positive for each 5-year period.

On the other hand, it also appears that for most hedge-fund strategies, performance in recent years has not been as strong as it was in the earlier period. Perhaps this result should have been anticipated. Strategies that were novel and successful in the 2002-2006 period would be expected to elicit copy-cat products from competing funds. As more funds crowd into any strategy, their actions would move prices and reduce profit opportunities. This is the familiar dynamic of a market that discovers and progressively competes away any pricing inefficiencies uncovered by an initial cohort of innovative investors.

# Style Analysis

Style analysis (introduced in Chapter 24) uses regression analysis to measure the exposure of a portfolio to various factors or asset classes. The betas on a set of factors measure the fund's exposure to each source of systematic risk. While a market-neutral fund will have no sensitivity to an index for that market, it may have significant betas, or loading, on other factors, such as credit conditions. Directional funds will exhibit significant betas on factors on which the fund tends to bet. We present a simple style analysis for the hedge fund indexes in Table 26.3. The four systematic factors we consider are:

Equity markets: the return on the market index.
- Credit conditions: the difference in the returns of Baa-rated bonds versus Treasury bonds.
- Interest rates: the excess return on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds.
- Foreign exchange: the percentage change in the value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies.

The excess returns on hedge fund index  $i$  in month  $t$  may be statistically described by

$$
R _ {i t} = \alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {i 1} \text {F a c t o r} 1 _ {t} + \dots + \beta_ {i 4} \text {F a c t o r} 4 _ {t} + e _ {i t} \tag {26.4}
$$

The betas (equivalently, factor loadings) measure the sensitivity to each factor. The residual,  $e_{it}$ , measures nonsystematic risk uncorrelated with the set of explanatory factors, and the intercept,  $\alpha_{i}$ , measures the average excess return of fund  $i$  net of the impact of these systematic factors.

Table 26.3 presents factor exposure estimates for several hedge fund indexes. The results confirm that most funds are in fact directional, with very clear exposures to

one or more of the factors. The estimated factor betas seem reasonable in terms of the funds' stated style. Some examples:

- The market-neutral funds have uniformly low and statistically insignificant factor betas, as one would expect of a market-neutral posture.
Distressed-firm funds have significant exposure to credit conditions (more positive credit spreads in this table indicate better economic conditions). This exposure arises because restructuring activities often depend on access to borrowing.
- Fixed-income arbitrage funds also show positive exposure to the differential return on corporate versus Treasury bonds.

We conclude that, by and large, most hedge funds are making very explicit directional bets on a wide array of economic factors.

Analyze the factor betas of the fixed-income arbitrage index in Table 26.3. On the basis of these results, are these funds typically market neutral? if not, do their factor exposures make sense in terms of the markets in which they operate?

# Historical Performance of Private Equity

Performance of VC and LBO funds have varied widely across vintage years. Table 26.4 presents their internal rates of return by vintage year.[49] The arithmetic average fund returns for VCs and LBOs are  $14.09\%$  and  $18.92\%$ , respectively. But if each vintage year is weighted by the capitalization for that year, the average returns increase to  $15.26\%$  and  $19.31\%$ . LBO standard deviation is low compared to that of VCs, suggesting a good reward-to-risk ratio.

Fund performance not surprisingly correlates with the strength of IPO markets when funds exit their portfolio companies. Because most funds have an average lifespan

between 10 and 14 years, $^{50}$  vintage year is both a performance predictor and a benchmark tool. McKenzie and Janeway $^{51}$  conclude that IPO market conditions at the time of exit are the key determinant of fund performance.

Venture capital returns are generated when the fund exits from portfolio companies. Figure 26.7 shows annualized performance by asset class for 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods compared to the S&P 500.[52] Both asset classes outperform the S&P 500 in every period, though their illiquidity and reliance on IPO markets for exits suggest they do better as components of a broader portfolio rather than as stand-alone investments.

Grandstanding As noted earlier, the initial public offering is usually the most profitable exit, often by orders of magnitude. A single initial public offering can drive the returns of an entire fund and secure capital for multiple future funds. The tremendous pressure to generate an IPO can incentivize VC funds to bring companies to market too early. This practice, known as grandstanding, has been well documented, with more IPO underpricing for companies backed by younger VCs. Younger VCs sit on their portfolio companies' boards of directors for a significantly shorter length of time by the time of the IPO. They also time the IPO to match fund-raising for follow-on funds.[53] While this might benefit the VCs in the short run, grandstanding damages the prospects of success for firms brought to market too early and may damage the VC's reputation in the long run.

Industry Specialization VCs can be either generalists or industry-specific specialists. For example, a biotech industry specialist fund will invest only in biotech entrepreneurs. In contrast, a generalist fund may purposely seek industry diversification or may be agnostic

to industry, focusing on other desirable characteristics, like defendable intellectual property or the potential to disrupt current markets.

Do specialists or generalists tend to perform better? One measure of this might be how their portfolio companies perform after exiting the fund. Start-ups brought public through an IPO remain public unless the firm is delisted by the stock exchange (or acquired by another firm). Survival as a publicly listed firm is positively correlated with venture backing overall, but VCs that specialize in one industry have produced firms that survived (i.e., remained listed) about  $14\%$  longer than generalist VC-backed firms.[54] In addition, industry-specializing VCs back IPOs with better historical rates of return and defy the tendency of IPOs to underperform the S&P 500 after listing. VC specialization suggests a depth of industry knowledge that provides an advantage in identifying disruptive or high-quality start-ups.

# Efficient Frontier

In Chapter 25, we saw that adding international equity to the universe of investable assets shifts the efficient frontier up and left, producing a capital allocation line (CAL) with a higher Sharpe ratio. In a similar fashion, adding alternative asset classes to the set of available securities shifts the efficient frontier even further. Alternative assets have low correlation with public securities. Some alternatives, particularly VC and LBO, can be return engines that greatly improve the expected return of a diversified portfolio.

To demonstrate this, we expand the investable universe to include not only domestic equity (S&P 500 Index) and international equity (EAFE), but also hedge funds, venture capital, leveraged buyouts, real estate, and natural resources. With some moderate restrictions, including minimum  $(5\%)$  and maximum  $(20\%)$  allocation limits, the results are a steeper CAL, as Figure 26.8 demonstrates. The optimal portfolio (tangent to the highest CAL) generates a Sharpe ratio of .44 compared to the S&P 500's Sharpe ratio of .28. Even the minimum-variance portfolio generates a Sharpe ratio of .33, still greater than the S&P 500.

# 26.6 Fee Structure in Alternative Investments

# Incentive Fees

The typical hedge fund and private equity fee structure includes an annual management fee of  $1 - 3\%$  of assets under management plus an incentive fee equal to  $20\%$  of investment profits beyond a stipulated benchmark performance. Figure 26.9 illustrates the incentive fee for a fund with a  $20\%$  incentive fee and a hurdle rate equal to the money market rate,  $r_f$ . The current value of the portfolio is denoted  $S_0$  and its year-end value is  $S_T$ . The manager gets the fee if the portfolio value rises sufficiently but loses nothing if it falls. Therefore, the incentive fee is equivalent to .20 call option on the portfolio with a strike price equal to current portfolio value times  $(1 + \text{benchmark return})$ , i.e.,  $S_0 \times (1 + r_f)$ .

This suggests that the value of the incentive fee can be estimated using an option pricing model. Example 26.6 illustrates.

# Example 26.6 Black-Scholes Valuation of Incentive Fees

Suppose the standard deviation of a hedge fund's annual rate of return is 30\% and the incentive fee is 20\% of any investment return over the risk-free money market rate. If the portfolio currently has a net asset value of 100 per share and the effective annual risk-free rate is 5\% (or 4.88\% expressed as a continuously compounded rate), then the implicit exercise price on the incentive fee is \$ 105. The Black-Scholes value of a call option with S_0 = 100, X = 105, \sigma = .30, r_{cc} = .0488, T = 1 year is \$ 11.92, just a shade below 12\% of net asset value. Because the incentive fee is worth 20\% of the call option, its value is just about 2.4\% of net asset value. Together with a typical management fee of 2\% of net asset value, the investor in the fund pays annual fees with a hefty total value of 4.4\% of assets under management.

The major complication to this description of the typical compensation structure is the high-water mark. If a fund experiences significant loss, it may not be able to charge an incentive fee unless and until it recovers to its previous higher value. With large losses, this may be difficult. A high-water mark therefore incentivizes managers to ramp up risk (which makes their implicit call option more valuable) or shut down funds that have performed poorly. This is likely one cause of the high attrition rate exhibited by hedge funds.

Figure 26.9 Incentive fees as a call option. The current value of the portfolio is denoted  $S_0$  and its year-end value is  $S_T$ . The incentive fee is equivalent to .20 call option on the portfolio with exercise price  $S_0(1 + r_f)$ .


# Private Equity Chasing Waterfalls

While both hedge funds and private equity funds face high-water marks, private equity has an additional layer of complexity when calculating manager compensation and fund performance. GPs return capital to LPs when portfolio companies are exited. The returns LPs ultimately receive are governed by the distribution waterfall, which specifies the priority of these cash flows. The first distributions flow  $100\%$  towards the LP until invested capital is returned. The next tier is an agreed-upon hurdle rate, also referred to as a preferred return, that is promised to the LP before any incentive fee is taken by the GP. Hurdle rates are typically  $8\%$ . This tier also flows entirely towards the LPs. After this rate is satisfied, GPs begin collecting carried interest through use of a catch-up provision. This provision allows the GP to collect a larger percentage of distributions until the average increases to reflect the original LP/GP split (typically  $80\% / 20\%$ ). The GP catch-up is typically very high,  $80\%$  or more being common. Once the GP catches up to its promised share, remaining distributions typically go  $80\%$  to LPs and  $20\%$  to GPs. Finally, LPs sometimes have the right to reclaim part of the GP's carried interest in the event of severe losses after GPs have received distributions. This provision is called a clawback and is deployed when subsequent losses mean the GPs have received excess compensation.[55]

# Funds of Funds

A notable fraction of the hedge fund universe, and even some private equity, is invested in funds of funds, which are funds that invest in one or more other hedge or private equity funds. Funds of funds are also called feeder funds because they feed assets from the original investor to a portfolio of funds. They are marketed as giving investors the capability to diversify across funds, as well as to provide the due diligence involved in screening funds for investment worthiness. In principle, this can be a valuable service because many alternative assets are opaque and feeder funds may have greater insight than typical outsiders.

However, when Bernard Madoff was arrested in December 2008 after admitting to a massive Ponzi scheme, many large feeder funds were found to be among his biggest clients, and their "due diligence" may have been, to put it mildly, lacking. At the head of the list was Fairfield Greenwich Advisors, with exposure reported at  \$7.5 billion, but several other feeder funds and asset management firms around the world were also on the hook for amounts greater than\$ 1 billion. In the end, it appears that some funds had, in effect, become little more than marketing agents for Madoff.

The option-like nature of compensation can have a big impact on expected fees in funds of funds. This is because the fund of funds pays an incentive fee to each underlying fund that outperforms its benchmark, even if the aggregate performance of the fund of funds is poor. Example 26.7 demonstrates that here diversification can hurt you!56

# Example 26.7 Incentive Fees in Funds of Funds

Suppose a fund of funds is established with 1 million invested in each of three hedge funds. For simplicity, we will ignore the asset-value-based portion of fees (the management fee) and focus only on the incentive fee. Suppose that the hurdle rate for the incentive fee is a zero return, so each fund charges an incentive fee of 20\% of total return. The following table shows the performance of each underlying fund over a year, the gross rate of return, and the return realized by the fund of funds net of the incentive fee. Funds 1 and 2 have positive returns, and therefore earn an incentive fee, but Fund 3 has terrible performance, so its incentive fee is zero.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Fund 1</td><td>Fund 2</td><td>Fund 3</td><td>Fund of Funds</td></tr><tr><td>Start of year (millions)</td><td>$1.00</td><td>$1.00</td><td>$1.00</td><td>$3.00</td></tr><tr><td>End of year (millions)</td><td>$1.20</td><td>$1.40</td><td>$0.25</td><td>$2.85</td></tr><tr><td>Gross rate of return</td><td>20\%</td><td>40\%</td><td>-75\%</td><td>-5\%</td></tr><tr><td>Incentive fee (millions)</td><td>$0.04</td><td>$0.08</td><td>$0.00</td><td>$0.12</td></tr><tr><td>End of year, net of fee</td><td>$1.16</td><td>$1.32</td><td>$0.25</td><td>$2.73</td></tr><tr><td>Net rate of return</td><td>16\%</td><td>32\%</td><td>-75\%</td><td>-9\%</td></tr></table>

Even though the return on the aggregate portfolio of the fund of funds is negative  $5\%$ , it still pays incentive fees of $.12 for every \$3 invested because incentive fees are paid on the first two well-performing funds. The incentive fees amount to  $4\%$  of net asset value. As demonstrated in the last column, this reduces the rate of return earned by the fund of funds from  $-5\%$  to  $-9\%$ .

# SUMMARY

1. Like traditional assets, alternative assets are governed by the laws of supply and demand as well as risk and expected return. However, alternative assets differ from traditional assets with respect to disclosure, investor base, flexibility and predictability of investment orientation, regulation, liquidity, investment horizon, and fee structure.
2. Hedge funds pool the assets of several clients and manage these assets on their clients' behalf. Directional hedge funds take a stance on the performance of broad market sectors. Nondirectional funds establish market-neutral positions on relative mispricing. Even these hedged positions still present idiosyncratic risk.
3. Statistical arbitrage uses quantitative systems to find potential misalignments in relative pricing. It ensures profits by averaging over many small bets.
4. Portable alpha is a strategy that invests in positive-alpha positions, hedges the systematic risk of those investments, and establishes market exposure where desired by using passive index products or futures contracts.
5. Venture capital is professionally managed money that invests in start-ups. Venture capital funds provide financing in exchange for ownership positions. This form of private equity actively tries to improve and grow the start-up with an eye toward an eventual IPO or acquisition.
6. Leveraged buyouts buy publicly traded companies, taking them private to improve their governance, operations, and financial structure. To amplify equity returns, LBOs use large amounts of debt to leverage their ownership and returns. Evidence suggests that both LBOs and VCs contribute to innovation.

7. Performance evaluation of alternative assets is complicated by the liquidity premia, reporting biases, and unreliable market valuations of infrequently traded assets. Performance evaluation is particularly difficult when a fund engages in option positions. Tail events make it hard to assess the true performance of positions without extremely long histories of returns.
8. Both hedge funds and private equity typically charge investors a management fee and an incentive fee equal to a percentage of profits beyond some threshold value, typically capital returned plus a hurdle rate. The incentive fee is akin to a call option on the portfolio.

8. A market-neutral fund (\$150,000,000) strives for very low market risk (β = .15). It believes it can generate α = .04 per quarter. The β of the underlying portfolio is 1.35. The risk-free rate is 0.5\% per quarter and the S&P 500 is currently priced at 4,000 (E-mini S&P 500 multiplier = \$50). If the S&P 500 is 3,800 at the end of quarter, what is the expected return on the portfolio?

9. Log in to Connect and link to Chapter 26 to find a spreadsheet containing monthly values of the S&P 500 index. Suppose that in each month you had written an out-of-the-money put option on one unit of the index with an exercise price  $5\%$  lower than the current value of the index.

a. What would have been the average value of your gross monthly payouts on the puts over the 10-year period October 1977–September 1987? The standard deviation?
b. Now extend your sample by 1 month to include October 1987 and recalculate the average payout and standard deviation of the put-writing strategy.
c. What do you conclude about tail risk in naked put writing?

10. Suppose a hedge fund follows the following strategy. Each month it holds \$100 million of an S&P 500 index fund and writes out-of-the-money put options on \$100 million of the index with exercise price 5\% lower than the current value of the index. Suppose the premium it receives for writing each put is $.25 million, roughly in line with the actual value of the puts.

a. Calculate the Sharpe ratio the fund would have realized in the period October 1982–September 1987. Compare its Sharpe ratio to that of the S&P 500. Use the data from the previous problem, available in Connect, and assume the monthly risk-free interest rate over this period was .7\%.
b. Now calculate the Sharpe ratio the fund would have realized if we extend the sample period by one month to include October 1987.
c. What do you conclude about performance evaluation and tail risk for funds pursuing option-like strategies?

11. The following is part of the computer output from a regression of monthly returns on Waterworks stock against the S&P 500 index. A hedge fund believes that Waterworks is underpriced, with an alpha of  $2\%$  over the coming month.

<table><tr><td>Beta</td><td>R-square</td><td>Standard Deviation of Residuals</td></tr><tr><td>0.75</td><td>0.65</td><td>0.06 (i.e., 6\% monthly)</td></tr></table> a. If the fund holds a \$4 million position in Waterworks stock and wishes to hedge market exposure for the next month using 1-month maturity S&P 500 futures contracts, how many contracts should it enter? Should it buy or sell contracts? The S&P 500 currently is at 4,000 and the contract multiplier is \$50.

$b$ . What is the standard deviation of the monthly return of the hedged portfolio?
c. Assuming that monthly returns are approximately normally distributed, what is the probability that this market-neutral strategy will lose money over the next month? Assume the risk-free rate is .5\% per month.
d. Suppose you hold an equally weighted portfolio of 100 stocks with the same alpha, beta, and residual standard deviation as Waterworks. Assume the residual returns (the  $e$  terms in Equations 26.1 and 26.2) on each of these stocks are independent of each other. What is the residual standard deviation of the portfolio?
e. Recalculate the probability of a loss on a market-neutral strategy involving equally weighted, market-hedged positions in the 100 stocks over the next month.

12. Return to Problem 11, parts  $(a) - (c)$ . Now suppose that the manager misestimates the beta of Waterworks stock, believing it to be .50 instead of .75. The standard deviation of the monthly market rate of return is  $5\%$ .

$a$ . What is the standard deviation of the (now improperly) hedged portfolio?
b. What is the probability of incurring a loss over the next month if the monthly market return has an expected value of  $1\%$  and a standard deviation of  $5\%$ ? Compare your answer to the probability you found in Problem 11.

c. What would be the probability of a loss using the data in Problem 11, parts  $(d)$  and  $(e)$ , if the manager similarly misestimated beta as .50 instead of .75? Compare your answer to the probability you found in Problem 11.
$d$ . Why does the misestimation of beta matter so much more for the 100-stock portfolio than it does for the 1-stock portfolio?

13. Here are data on three hedge funds. Each fund charges its investors an incentive fee of  $20\%$  of total returns. Suppose initially that a fund of funds (FF) manager buys equal amounts of each of these funds, also charging its investors a  $20\%$  incentive fee. For simplicity, assume also that management fees other than incentive fees are zero for all funds.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Hedge Fund 1</td><td>Hedge Fund 2</td><td>Hedge Fund 3</td></tr><tr><td>Start of year value (millions)</td><td>$100</td><td>$100</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Gross portfolio rate of return</td><td>20\%</td><td>10\%</td><td>30\%</td></tr></table>

$a$ . Compute the rate of return after incentive fees to an investor in the fund of funds.
b. Suppose that instead of buying shares in each of the three hedge funds, a stand-alone (SA) hedge fund purchases the same portfolio as the three underlying funds. The total value and composition of the SA fund is therefore identical to the one that would result from aggregating the three hedge funds. Consider an investor in the SA fund. After paying  $20\%$  incentive fees, what would be the value of the investor's portfolio at the end of the year?
c. Confirm that the investor's rate of return in SA is higher than in FF by an amount equal to the extra layer of fees charged by the fund of funds.
$d$ . Now suppose that the return on the portfolio held by hedge fund 3 were  $-30\%$  rather than  $+30\%$ . Recalculate your answers to parts  $(a)$  and  $(b)$ .
$e$ . Will either FF or SA charge an incentive fee in the scenario of part  $(d)$ ?
$f$ . Why then does the investor in FF still do worse than the investor in SA?

You are willing to contribute \$1,500,000 in the A round of financing and require a capital return (i.e., capital multiplier) of 12. You anticipate B and C rounds of financing in years 3 and 6 that will dilute your position by 30\% and 40\%, respectively, because your firm will not participate in either additional round.

17. You manage a multi-stage VC fund conducting due diligence on an pharmaceutical start-up. The required rate of return is  $33\%$ . You will participate in an A round initially, a B round in four years, and a C round in seven years.

a. In the A round, what equity position do you need to justify a \$1,000,000 investment if the pre-round valuation of the firm is \$2,500,000?
b. In the B round, an additional 4,500,000 will be raised from a syndication of VCs including your firm. To maintain your equity position, how much must you contribute to the B round of financing? Assume the firm is valued at cost.
c. In the C round, an additional 10,000,000 will be raised from the same syndication of VCs. If you wish to continue to maintain the same equity position, how much will you need to invest in this round? Assume the firm continues to be valued at cost.

18. An endowment invests 150,000,000 in WeGrow II, an early-stage venture fund with a 20\% incentive fee and a 5\% preferred return [hurdle rate]. The fund invests in the following companies (for simplicity, ignore staged financing and management fees; assume instead that all investments occur at the end of their denoted year):

<table><tr><td>Start-up Name</td><td>Investment (Year Invested)</td><td>Harvested (Year Harvested)</td></tr><tr><td>SPE Incorporated</td><td>$35,000,000 (2)</td><td>$62,000,000 (7)</td></tr><tr><td>NitelD Corporation</td><td>$20,000,000 (2)</td><td>$300,000,000 (9)</td></tr><tr><td>D-Ton Incorporated</td><td>$15,000,000 (2)</td><td>$0 (8)</td></tr><tr><td>IKL Limited</td><td>$20,000,000 (3)</td><td>$100,000,000 (7)</td></tr><tr><td>H&amp;L Innovations</td><td>$25,000,000 (3)</td><td>$125,000,000 (10)</td></tr><tr><td>SimLife Technologies</td><td>$35,000,000 (4)</td><td>$ 0 (9)</td></tr></table>

b. Round B: A syndication of Cypress Ventures, Specific Pacific Management, and Mountainhome Capital Group invests 750,000 each. Now determine the ownership for each party assuming the start-up is valued at cost.
c. What would be the minimum necessary voting rights for the founders to maintain control through both rounds of financing? (Control is defined as greater than  $50\%$  ownership, with percentages rounded to whole numbers.)

21. The RRK buyout fund is considering an investment in a fertilizer distribution center. The stock currently trades at  \$20 per share with 150,000,000 shares outstanding. RRK offers\$ 25 per share, 80\% of which is funded by high-yield debt securities. The fund believes it can work with management to grow the firm at a rate of about 4\% while also retiring half of the high-yield debt by an expected exit in year 6, reinvesting any profit in growth and debt reduction. What is the expected IRR of this investment?

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. a. Nondirectional. The shares in the fund and the short position in the index swap constitute a hedged position. The hedge fund is betting that the discount on the closed-end fund will shrink and that it will profit regardless of the general movements in the Indian market.
b. Nondirectional. The values of both ExxonMobil and Chevron are largely driven by oil industry prospects, so this is a bet on relative performance.
c. Directional. This is an outright bet on the price that Generic Pharmaceuticals will eventually command at the conclusion of the predicted takeover attempt.
2. The expected rate of return on the hedged position (in the absence of any knowledge about idiosyncratic returns reflected in the residual) is  $3\%$ . If the residual turns out to be  $-4\%$ , then the position will lose  $1\%$  of its value over the month and fall to 2.475 million.
3. a.  $w_{\text{Terminal}} = \frac{v_{\text{Initial}} \times \text{Capital multiplier}}{v_{\text{Terminal}}} = \frac{\$2,000,000 \times 10}{\$90,000,000} = .2222$ , or  $22.22\%$

$$ w _ {\text {Intermediate}} = \frac {w _ {\text {Terminal}}}{1 - \text {Second Dilution}} = \frac {.2222}{1 - 0.25} = .2963, \text {or} 29.63 \%
$$

$$ w _ {\text {Initial}} = \frac {w _ {\text {Intermediate}}}{1 - \text {First Dilution}} = \frac {.2963}{1 - 0.25} = .3951, \text {or} 39.51 \%
$$

$b$ . If the VC commits to investing sufficient capital to maintain its initial ownership level, then the initial position can be set equal to the terminal ownership level  $(22.22\%)$ .

4. Debt is used to amplify the return of the LBO's position. For the all-equity position, the initial investment of \$25 million grows to \$48 million after 5 years, so we solve for the IRR as follows:

$$
\$ 25,000,000 = \frac{\$ 48,000,000}{(1 + \mathrm{IRR})^{5}}\text{, which implies that IRR is} 13.94\%
$$

At an initial debt-to-equity ratio of 1, the firm raises half the acquisition fee by contributing its own capital and raises the other half by borrowing. Therefore, its initial contribution is only  \$12.5 million, and its final payout is\$ 48 million – \$12.5 million = \$35.5 million. IRR increases to 23.22\%, found as follows:

$$
\$ 12,500,000 = \frac{\$ 35,500,000}{(1 + \mathrm{IRR})^{5}}\rightarrow \mathrm{IRR} = 23.22\%
$$

At 20\% equity/80\% debt, the initial equity investment is only 20\% of \$25 million, or \$5 million, leaving \$20 million of debt to be raised. Therefore, the final payout is \$48 million – \$20 million = \$28 million. IRR vaults to 41.14\%, demonstrating the power of leverage.

$$
\$ 5,000,000 = \frac{\$ 28,000,000}{(1 + \mathrm{IRR})^{5}}\rightarrow \mathrm{IRR} = 41.14\%
$$

5. Fixed-income arbitrage portfolios show positive exposure to the long bond and to the credit spread. This pattern suggests that these are not hedged arbitrage portfolios, but in fact are directional portfolios.
