# Investment Policy and the Framework of the CFA Institute

# 28

TRANSLATING THE ASPIRATIONS and circumstances of diverse households into appropriate investment decisions is a daunting task. Financial advisors must translate vague and nonquantitative concerns into concrete investment decisions. The task is equally difficult for institutions, most of which have many stakeholders and often are regulated by various authorities. The investment process is not easily reduced to a simple or mechanical algorithm.

While many principles of investments are quite general and apply to virtually all investors, some issues are peculiar to the specific investor. For example, tax bracket, age, risk tolerance, wealth, job prospects, and other uncertainties make each investor's circumstances somewhat unique. In this chapter, we ask how investors can systematically review their particular objectives, constraints, and circumstances. Along the way, we survey some of the major classes of institutional investors and examine the special issues they must confront.

There is no unique "correct" investment process. However, some approaches are better than others, and it can be helpful to take one high-quality approach as a useful case study. For this reason, we will examine the approach suggested by the CFA Institute. Among other things, the Institute administers examinations to certify investment professionals as Chartered Financial Analysts. Therefore, the approach we outline is also one that a highly respected professional group endorses through the curriculum that it requires investment practitioners to master.


The basic framework involves dividing the investment process into four stages: specifying objectives, specifying constraints, formulating policy, and later monitoring and updating the portfolio as needed. We treat each of these activities in turn. We start with an overview of the investment process and a description of the major types of investors, both individual and institutional. We then turn to the objectives and constraints peculiar to each investor class, asking how those factors influence investment policy.

We examine how the special circumstances of both individuals as well as institutions such as pension funds affect investment decisions. We also will see how the tax system can affect investment decisions.

# 28.1 The Investment Management Process

The CFA Institute divides the process of investment management into three main elements that constitute a dynamic feedback loop: planning, execution, and feedback. Figure 28.1 and Table 28.1 describe the steps in that process. As shorthand, you might think of planning as focused largely on establishing the inputs necessary for decision making. These include data about the client as well as the capital market, resulting in very broad policy guidelines (the strategic asset allocation). Execution fleshes out the details of optimal asset allocation and security selection. Finally, feedback is the process of adapting to changes in expectations and objectives as well as to changes in portfolio composition that result from changes in market prices.

The result of this analysis can be summarized in an investment policy statement addressing the topics specified in Table 28.2. In the next sections we elaborate on the steps leading to such an investment policy statement.

Table 28.1 indicates that the management planning process starts by analyzing one's investment clients—in particular, by considering the objectives and constraints that govern their decisions. Portfolio objectives center on the risk-return trade-off between the expected return the investors want (return requirements in the first column of Table 28.3) and how much risk they are willing to assume (risk tolerance). Investment managers must know the level of risk that can be tolerated in the pursuit of a higher expected rate of return.

Determination of portfolio policies

Investors also must deal with various constraints on their portfolio choice that derive from considerations such as liquidity needs, regulations, or tax concerns. The second column of Table 28.3 lists the more important constraints. In the next two sections, we explore some of these objectives and constraints.

Here is an example of a short quiz that may be used by financial institutions to help estimate risk tolerance.

<table><tr><td>Question</td><td>1 Point</td><td>2 Points</td><td>3 Points</td><td>4 Points</td></tr><tr><td>1. I plan on using the money I am investing:</td><td>Within 6 months.</td><td>Within the next 3 years.</td><td>Between 3 and 6 years.</td><td>No sooner than 7 years from now.</td></tr><tr><td>2. My investments make up this share of assets (excluding home):</td><td>More than 75\%.</td><td>50\% or more but less than 75\%.</td><td>25\% or more but less than 50\%.</td><td>Less than 25\%.</td></tr><tr><td>3. I expect my future income to:</td><td>Decrease.</td><td>Remain the same or grow slowly.</td><td>Grow faster than the rate of inflation.</td><td>Grow quickly.</td></tr><tr><td>4. I have emergency savings:</td><td>No.</td><td>No.</td><td>Yes, but less than I&#x27;d like to have.</td><td>Yes.</td></tr><tr><td>5. I would risk this share of my portfolio in exchange for the same probability of doubling my money:</td><td>Zero.</td><td>10\%.</td><td>25\%.</td><td>50\%.</td></tr><tr><td>6. I have invested in stocks and stock mutual funds:</td><td>No.</td><td>Yes, but I was uneasy about it.</td><td>No, but I look forward to it.</td><td>Yes, and I was comfortable with it.</td></tr><tr><td>7. My most important investment goal is to:</td><td>Preserve my original investment.</td><td>Receive some growth and provide income.</td><td>Grow faster than inflation but still provide some income.</td><td>Grow as fast as possible. Income is not important today.</td></tr></table>

Add the number of points for all seven questions. Add one point if you choose the first answer, two if you choose the second answer, and so on. If you score between 25 and 28 points, consider yourself an aggressive investor. If you score between 20 and 24 points, your risk tolerance is above average. If you score between 15 and 19 points, consider yourself a moderate investor. This means you are willing to accept some risk in exchange for a potential higher rate of return. If you score fewer than 15 points, consider yourself a conservative investor. If you have fewer than 10 points, you may consider yourself a very conservative investor.

# 28.2 Investor Objectives

Objectives and constraints vary widely across investor types. We begin with a brief overview of the broad objectives that characterize eight major categories of investors, focusing on their return objectives and tolerance for risk.

# Individual Investors

The basic factors affecting an individual investor's objectives usually arise from that person's stage in the life cycle. The first significant investment decision commonly concerns education, which is an investment in "human capital." The major asset most people have during their early working years is the earning power derived from their skills. At this stage of life, the financial risk due to illness or injury is far greater than that associated with the rate of return on their portfolios of financial assets. Therefore, the most important financial decisions concern insurance against the possibility of disability or death.

As one ages and accumulates savings to provide for consumption during retirement, the composition of wealth shifts from human capital toward financial capital. At this point, portfolio choices become progressively more important. In middle age, most investors will be willing to take on a meaningful amount of portfolio risk to increase their expected rates of return.


Questionnaires such as the one in the nearby box suggest that risk aversion increases as investors near retirement age. With age, individuals lose the potential to recover from disastrous investment performance. When they are young, they can respond to a loss by working harder (or further into their old age) and saving more of their income. But as retirement approaches, investors have less time to recalibrate their financial plans—hence, their decreasing tolerance for risk.

Personal Trusts Personal trusts are established when an individual confers legal title to property to another person or institution (the trustee) to manage that property for one or more beneficiaries. The trustee is usually a bank, a lawyer, or an investment professional. Investment of a trust is subject to trust laws, as well as "prudent investor" rules that limit investments to those that a prudent person would select.

Objectives for personal trusts normally are more limited in scope than those of individual investors. Because of their fiduciary responsibility, personal trust managers typically are more risk averse than are individual investors. Certain asset classes such as options and futures contracts, for example, and strategies such as short-selling or buying on margin are ruled out.

Mutual Funds Mutual funds are pools of investors' money. They invest in ways specified in their prospectuses and issue shares to investors entitling them to a pro rata portion of the income generated by the funds. The return requirement and risk tolerance across mutual funds are highly variable because funds segment the investor market. Various funds appeal to distinct investor groups and will adopt a return requirement and risk tolerance that fit a particular market niche. For example, income funds cater to the conservative investor, while high-growth funds seek out the more risk-tolerant ones. Tax-free bond funds segment the market by tax bracket. A mutual fund's orientation is spelled out in its prospectus.

Pension Funds Pension fund objectives depend on the type of pension plan. There are two basic types: defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. Defined contribution plans [e.g., 401(k) plans] are in effect tax-deferred retirement savings accounts, with the employee bearing all the risk and receiving all the return from the plan's assets. These plans are called defined contribution because the firm's only obligation is to make the stipulated contributions to the employee's retirement account. The employee is responsible for directing the management of the assets, usually by selecting among several investment funds in which the assets can be placed. Therefore, objectives for defined contribution plans are similar to those that would pertain to each individual investor.

In defined benefit plans, by contrast, the employer has an obligation to provide a specified annual retirement benefit. That benefit is defined by a formula that typically takes into account years of service and the level of salary or wages. For example, the employer may pay the retired employee a yearly amount equal to  $2\%$  of the employee's final annual salary for each year of service. Employees who had worked for 30 years would then receive an annual benefit equal to  $60\%$  of their final salary. The payments are an obligation of the employer, and the assets in the pension fund provide collateral for the promised benefits. If the investment performance of the assets is poor, the firm is obligated to make up the shortfall by contributing additional assets to the fund. Therefore, many defined benefit plans take an assumed rate of return for the asset portfolio as their return objective, with the risk surrounding investment performance borne by the firm. We discuss pension plans more fully later in this chapter.

Endowment Funds Endowment funds are organizations chartered to use their money for specific nonprofit purposes. They are financed by gifts from one or more sponsors and are typically managed by educational, cultural, and charitable organizations or by independent foundations established to carry out the fund's specific purposes. Generally, the investment objective is to produce a steady flow of income subject to only a moderate degree of risk. Moreover, because these funds often are envisioned as lasting for generations, they also seek to at least maintain the real value of the asset portfolio. Trustees of an endowment fund, however, can specify other objectives as dictated by specific circumstances.

Life Insurance Companies Life insurance companies generally try to invest so as to hedge their liabilities, which are defined by the policies they write. The company can reduce risk by investing in assets that will return more in the event the insurance policy coverage becomes more expensive.

For example, if the company writes a policy that pays a death benefit linked to the consumer price index, then the company is subject to inflation risk. It might search for assets expected to return more when the rate of inflation rises, thus hedging the price-index linkage of the policy.

Until the 1980s, there were for all practical purposes only two types of life insurance policies available for individuals: whole-life and term. A whole-life insurance policy combines a death benefit with a kind of savings plan that provides for a gradual buildup of cash value that the policyholder can withdraw at a later point in life, usually at retirement. Term insurance, on the other hand, provides death benefits only, with no buildup of cash value.

The interest rate embedded in the schedule of cash value accumulation promised under a whole-life policy is a fixed rate, and life insurance companies try to hedge this liability by investing in long-term bonds. Often the insured individual has the right to borrow at a prespecified fixed interest rate against the cash value of the policy. The life insurance company prices its policies based in part on an assumed interest rate, and thus needs to earn this rate to achieve its profit goals.

During the inflationary years of the 1970s and early 1980s, when many older whole-life policies carried contractual borrowing rates far lower than those available in the capital markets, policyholders borrowed heavily against the cash value to invest in money market mutual funds paying double-digit yields. In response, the insurance industry came up with two new policy types: variable life and universal life. Under a variable life policy, the insured's premium buys a fixed death benefit plus a cash value that can be invested in a variety of mutual funds. With a universal life policy, policyholders can increase or reduce the premium or death benefit according to their needs. Furthermore, the interest rate on the cash value component changes with market interest rates. One important advantage of variable and universal life insurance policies is that earnings on the cash value are not taxed until the money is withdrawn.

Non-Life Insurance Companies Non-life insurance companies such as property and casualty insurers have investable funds primarily because they pay claims after they collect policy premiums. Typically, they are conservative in their attitude toward risk. A common thread in the objectives of pension plans and insurance companies is the need to hedge predictable long-term liabilities. Investment strategies typically call for hedging these liabilities with bonds of various maturities.

Banks Most bank investments are loans to businesses and consumers, and most of their liabilities are accounts of depositors. As investors, banks try to match the risk of assets to liabilities while earning a profitable spread between the lending and borrowing rates.

Most liabilities of banks and thrift institutions are checking accounts, time or savings deposits, and certificates of deposit (CDs). Checking account funds may be withdrawn at any time, so they are of the shortest maturity. Time or savings deposits are of various maturities. Some time deposits may extend as long as several years, but, on average, they have fairly short maturity. CDs are bonds of various maturities that the bank issues to investors. While the range of maturities is from 90 days to 10 years, the average is about one year.

In the past, a large part of the loan portfolio of savings and loan (S&L) institutions was in home mortgages, with typical maturities of 15-30 years. Today, the bulk of thrifts' portfolios are business loans. The maturities of these loans typically are less than those of mortgages but still generally exceed the maturities of sources of financing. Thus, profits are exposed to interest rate risk. When rates rise, thrifts have to pay higher rates to depositors, while the income from their longer-term investments is relatively fixed.

Banks earn profit from the interest rate spread between loans extended (the bank's assets) and deposits and CDs (the bank's liabilities), as well as from fees for services. Managing bank assets calls for balancing the loan portfolio with the portfolio of deposits and CDs. A bank can increase the interest rate spread by increasing risk: lending to riskier borrowers, who pay higher rates, or increasing the proportion of higher-yielding longer-term loans. However, bank capital regulations are risk-based, so higher-risk strategies will elicit higher capital requirements as well as the possibility of greater regulatory interference in the bank's affairs.

As we noted in Chapter 2, most long-term fixed-rate mortgages today are securitized into pass-through certificates and held as securities in the portfolios of mutual funds, pension funds, and other institutional investors. Mortgage originators typically sell a portion of the mortgages they originate to pass-through agencies such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac rather than holding them in a portfolio. They earn their profits on mortgage origination and servicing fees. The trend away from maintaining portfolio holdings of long-term mortgages has reduced interest rate risk.

Table 28.4 summarizes the objectives pertaining to each of these investor classes.

<table><tr><td>Type of Investor</td><td>Return Requirement</td><td>Risk Tolerance</td></tr><tr><td>Individual</td><td>Life cycle (education, children, retirement)</td><td>Life cycle (younger can be more risk tolerant about financial wealth)</td></tr><tr><td>Personal trusts</td><td>Life cycle</td><td>Prudent investor rules</td></tr><tr><td>Mutual funds</td><td>Variable</td><td>Variable</td></tr><tr><td>Pension funds (Defined benefit)</td><td>Assumed actuarial rate</td><td>Depends on proximity of payouts</td></tr><tr><td>Endowment funds</td><td>Determined by current income needs as well as need for asset growth to maintain real value</td><td>Generally conservative</td></tr><tr><td>Life insurance companies</td><td>Should exceed new money rate by sufficient margin to meet expenses and profit objectives; actuarial rates also important</td><td>Conservative</td></tr><tr><td>Non-life insurance companies</td><td>Match to contingent liabilities</td><td>Conservative</td></tr><tr><td>Banks</td><td>Maintain positive spread over interest rate paid on deposits</td><td>Variable</td></tr></table>

# 28.3 Investor Constraints

Even with identical attitudes toward risk, different households and institutions might choose different investment portfolios because of their differing circumstances. These circumstances, which include tax status, requirements for liquidity or a flow of income from the portfolio, or various regulatory restrictions, impose constraints on investor choice. Together, objectives and constraints determine investment policy.

Some constraints arise from an investor's particular circumstances. For example, if a family has children about to enter college, there will be a high demand for liquidity because cash will be needed to pay tuition bills. Other times, however, constraints are imposed externally. For example, banks and trusts are subject to legal limitations on the types of assets they may hold in their portfolios. Finally, some constraints are self-imposed. For example, social investing means that investors will not hold shares of firms involved in ethically objectionable activities. Some criteria that have been used to judge firms as ineligible for a portfolio are involvement in countries with human rights abuses, production of tobacco or weapons, and participation in polluting activities.

Table 28.5 presents a matrix summarizing the main constraints for each of the eight types of investors. The following discussion elaborates on these constraints.

# Liquidity

Liquidity is the ease (and speed) with which an asset can be sold and still fetch a fair price. It is a relationship between the time dimension (how long will it take to sell) and the price dimension (any discount from intrinsic value) of an investment asset. (See the discussion of liquidity in Chapter 9.)

When a quantitative measure of liquidity is necessary, one thinks of the discount when an immediate sale is unavoidable. Cash and money market instruments such as Treasury bills and commercial paper, where the bid-ask spread is a small fraction of  $1\%$ , are the most liquid assets, and real estate is among the least liquid. Office buildings and manufacturing structures can potentially experience a  $50\%$  liquidity discount.

Both individual and institutional investors must consider how likely they are to dispose of assets at short notice. From this likelihood, they establish the minimum level of liquid assets they require in the investment portfolio.

<table><tr><td>Type of Investor</td><td>Liquidity</td><td>Horizon</td><td>Regulatory</td><td>Taxes</td></tr><tr><td>Individuals</td><td>Variable</td><td>Life cycle</td><td>None</td><td>Variable</td></tr><tr><td>Personal trusts</td><td>Variable</td><td>Life cycle</td><td>Prudent investor laws</td><td>Variable</td></tr><tr><td>Mutual funds</td><td>Usually low</td><td>Short</td><td>Little</td><td>None*</td></tr><tr><td>Pension funds</td><td>Young, low; mature, high</td><td>Long</td><td>ERISA</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Endowment funds</td><td>Low</td><td>Long</td><td>Little</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Life insurance companies</td><td>Low</td><td>Long</td><td>Complex</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Non-life insurance companies</td><td>High</td><td>Short</td><td>Little</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Banks</td><td>Low</td><td>Short</td><td>Risk-based capital requirements</td><td>Yes</td></tr></table>

# Table 28.5

Matrix of constraints

* The mutual fund itself does not pay taxes, as all investment income is “passed through” to investors. However, it may pay attention to taxes on behalf of its investors.

# Investment Horizon

This is the planned liquidation date of the investment or substantial part of it. Examples of an individual investment horizon could be the time to fund a child's college education or the retirement date for a wage earner. For a university endowment, an investment horizon could relate to the time to fund a major campus construction project. Horizon needs to be considered when investors choose between assets of various maturities, such as bonds, which pay off at specified future dates. For example, the maturity date of a bond might make it a more attractive investment if it coincides with a date on which cash is needed. This idea is analogous to the matching principle from corporate finance: Strive to match financing maturity to the economic life of the financed asset.

# Regulations

Professional and institutional investors are constrained by many regulations. First and foremost is the prudent investor rule. That is, professional investors have a responsibility to restrict investments to assets that would have been approved by a prudent investor. The law is purposefully nonspecific. The asset manager must stand ready to defend an investment policy, and interpretation may differ according to the standards of the times.

Registered investment advisers are bound by a fiduciary standard, meaning that they are required to work in the best interests of their clients, specifically, that they must place their clients' interests above their own. In contrast, brokers or advisers working for broker-dealer firms were until recently subject to a lower standard of suitability, meaning that their investment recommendations needed to be acceptable but not necessarily the best choice for the client. For example, a client's money might have been placed in a "suitable" mutual fund even if similar, cheaper funds (but offering the broker lower sales commissions) were available. The SEC's Regulation Best Interest, adopted in 2019, attempts to improve on the suitability standard by directing brokers to disclose conflicts of interest arising from their compensation packages and give greater consideration to clients' rather than their own interests.

Critics of the new regulation argue that it is too vague about how brokers should avoid decisions driven by personal considerations and whether the disclosure of potential conflicts will be sufficiently transparent and easy for clients to understand. While they might sound synonymous, "best interest" standards are not as rigorous as "fiduciary" standards, and the onus is on investors to understand the obligations and potential conflicts of any particular financial representative.

Also, specific regulations apply to various institutional investors. For instance, U.S. mutual funds are subject to regulations that put upper bounds on the allowed use of leverage or investments in illiquid securities and lower bounds on some measures of diversification.

# Tax Considerations

Tax consequences are central to investment decisions. The performance of any investment strategy is measured by how much it yields after taxes. For household and institutional investors who face significant tax rates, tax sheltering and deferral of tax obligations may be pivotal in their investment strategy. We put off an extensive discussion of tax considerations until later in the chapter.

# Unique Needs

Virtually every investor faces special circumstances. Imagine husband-and-wife aeronautical engineers holding high-paying jobs in the same aerospace corporation. The entire human capital of that household is tied to a single player in a rather cyclical industry. This couple would need to hedge the risk of a deterioration of the economic well-being of the aerospace industry by investing in assets that will yield more if such deterioration materializes.


Similar issues would confront an executive on Wall Street who owns an apartment near work. Because the value of the home in that part of Manhattan probably depends on the vitality of the securities industry, the individual is doubly exposed to the vagaries of the stock market. Because both job and home already depend on the fortunes of Wall Street, the purchase of a typical diversified stock portfolio would actually increase the exposure to the stock market.

These examples illustrate that the job, or, more generally, human capital, is often an individual's biggest "asset," and the unique risk profile that results from employment can play a big role in determining a suitable investment portfolio.

Other unique needs of individuals often center around their stage in the life cycle. Retirement, housing, and children's education constitute three major demands for funds, and investment policy will depend in part on the proximity of these expenditures.

Institutional investors also face unique needs. For example, pension funds will differ in their investment policy, depending on the average age of plan participants. Another example of a unique need for an institutional investor would be a university whose trustees allow the administration to use only cash income from the endowment fund. This constraint could engender a preference for high-dividend-paying assets.

A particular constraint for mutual funds arises from investor response to the fund's performance. When a mutual fund earns an unsatisfactory rate of return, investors often redeem their shares—they withdraw money from the fund. The mutual fund then contracts. This dynamic creates liquidity needs, which constitute a constraint on investment strategy.

Pension funds are heavily regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). This law revolutionized savings for retirement in the U.S. and remains a major piece of social legislation. Thus, for pension funds, regulatory constraints are relatively important. Also, mature pension funds are required to pay out more than young funds and hence need more liquidity.

Life insurance companies are subject to complex regulation. The corporate tax rate, which currently is  $21\%$ , also applies to insurance company investment income, so taxes are an important concern.

Property and casualty insurance, like term life insurance, is written on a short-term basis. Most policies must be renewed annually, which means property and casualty insurance companies are subject to short-term horizon constraints.

The short horizon constraint for banks comes from the interest rate risk component of the interest rate spread (i.e., the risk of interest rate increases that banks face when financing long-term assets with short-term liabilities). Risk-based capital regulations, which mandate higher capital requirements for riskier investment portfolios, also impose constraints on bank portfolio choice.

# Concept Check 28.1 a. Think about the financial circumstances of your closest relative in your parents' generation (e.g., your parents' household if you are fortunate enough to have them around). Write down the objectives and constraints for their investment decisions.


b. Now consider the financial situation of your closest friend or relative who is in about 35 years old. Write down the objectives and constraints that would fit that individual's investment decision.

c. How much of the difference between the two statements is due to the age of the investors?

# 28.4 Policy Statements

Once objectives and constraints are determined, an investment policy that suits the investor can be formulated. That policy must reflect an appropriate risk-return profile as well as address needs for liquidity, income generation, and tax positioning. Institutional investors such as pension plans and endowments often must issue formal statements of their investment policy. These policy statements should be based on, and often make explicit, the objectives and constraints of the investment fund.

The investment policy statement (IPS) serves as a strategic guide to the planning and implementation of an investment program. When implemented successfully, the IPS anticipates issues related to governance of the investment program, planning for appropriate asset allocation, implementing an investment program with internal and/or external managers, monitoring the results, risk management, and appropriate reporting. The IPS also establishes accountability for the various entities that may work on behalf of an investor. Perhaps most important, the IPS serves as a policy guide that can offer an objective course of action to be followed during periods of disruption when emotional or instinctive responses might otherwise motivate less prudent actions.

The nearby box suggests desirable components of an investment policy statement for use with individual and/or high net worth investors. Not every component will be appropriate for every investor or every situation, and there may be other components that are desirable for inclusion reflecting unique investor circumstances.

# Sample Policy Statements for Individual Investors

Perhaps the best way to get a concrete feel for deriving actual policy statements is to consider a sample of such statements for a variety of investors. Therefore, we next present several examples.

# 1. Scope and Purpose

# 1a. Define the context:

A preamble is often useful to relate information about the investor and/or the source of wealth as a way of establishing the context in which an investment program will be implemented.

Example: "The assets of the Leveaux family trusts trace back to the establishment of Leveaux Vintners in 1902 by Claude Leveaux. In 1979, LVX Industries was purchased by the British conglomerate FoodCo. Michelle Leveaux established the Leveaux Foundation with 100 million of the sale proceeds, and much of the remainder constituted the Leveaux Family Trusts, which are the subject of this investment policy statement."

# 1b. Define the investor:

Define who the investor is, be it a natural person or legal/corporate entity.

Example: "This Investment Policy Statement governs the personal investment portfolios of Mr. Chen Guangping."

# 1c. Define the structure:

Set forth key responsibilities and actors.

Example: "Janice Jones, as financial adviser to Sam and Mary Smith, is responsible for coordinating updates to the Investment Policy. Sam and Mary Smith shall be responsible for approving the Investment Policy Statement."

# Desirable Components of an Investment Policy Statement for Individual Investors

# SCOPE AND PURPOSE

Define the context

Define the investor

Define the structure

# GOVERNANCE

Specify responsibility for determining investment policy

Describe process for review of IPS

Describe responsibility for engaging/discharging external advisers

Assign responsibility for determination of asset allocation

Assign responsibility for risk management

# INVESTMENT, RETURN, AND RISK OBJECTIVES

Describe overall investment objective

State return, distribution, and risk requirements

Determine the risk tolerance of the investor

Describe relevant constraints

Describe other relevant considerations

# RISK MANAGEMENT

Establish performance measurement accountabilities

Specify appropriate metrics for risk measurement

Define a process by which portfolios are rebalanced.

Set forth a "standard of care" for those serving as adviser. Regulations in different jurisdictions may allow for advisers to abide by different standards depending on their preferences, business models, and client preferences. Fiduciary standards generally require that advisers always hold client interests as foremost, whereas suitability standards require recommendations that are suitable for an investor based on the adviser's knowledge of that investor's circumstances.

Example: "Fuji Advisors acts as a fiduciary in its capacity as adviser to the Takesumi Family Accounts, and acknowledges that all advice and decisions rendered must reflect first and foremost the best interests of its clients."

# 2. Governance

2a. Specify who is responsible for determining investment policy, executing investment policy, and monitoring the results of implementation of the policy. The IPS assigns responsibility for all stages of investment policy development and implementation.
2b. Describe the process for review and updating of the IPS. A process for refreshing the IPS as investor circumstances and/or market conditions change should be clearly identified in advance.

Example: "Wanda Wood is responsible for monitoring the investing requirements of Sam and Susan Smith as well as investment and economic issues, and for suggesting changes to the IPS as necessary, and no less frequently than annually."

2c. Describe the responsibilities for engaging or discharging external advisers. The IPS should set forth who is responsible for hiring and firing external money managers, consultants, or other vendors associated with the investment assets.
2d. Assign responsibility for determination of asset allocation, including inputs used and criteria for development of input assumptions. An asset allocation framework provides strategic context to many of the more tactical (shorter-term) investment decisions. The IPS should address the assumptions used in developing and selecting inputs to the asset allocation decision process.

Example: "At least annually, Tower Advisors shall review the asset allocation of the Family Investment Accounts, and suggest revisions for final approval by James and Jennifer Jensen. Tower Advisors shall consider expected returns and correlation of returns for a broad representation of asset classes in the U.S. capital markets, as well as anticipated changes in the rate of inflation, and changes in marginal tax rates."

2e. Assign responsibility for risk management, monitoring, and reporting. The IPS should document who is responsible for setting risk policy, monitoring the risk profile of the investment portfolio, and reporting on portfolio risk.

3. Investment, Return, and Risk Objectives

3a. Describe overall investment objective. The IPS should relate the purpose of the assets being invested to a broad investment objective.

Example: "The investment program governed by the IPS is intended to supplement the earned income of Marcel Perrold as well as to provide for funds upon his retirement in 2030."

3b. State the return, distribution, and risk requirements.

State the overall investment performance objective. Careful specification of the overall investment performance objective is likely to incorporate descriptions of general funding needs as well as relations to key factors (such as inflation, spending rate, etc.).

Example: "The financial plan developed for Margarita Mendez indicates a required real growth rate of  $4\%$  to satisfy her future obligations and allow her to retire in 2034 as planned."

Identify performance objectives for each asset class eligible for investment. The investment policy statement should set forth all permissible asset classes in which the portfolio may be invested. Some investors may wish to risk-adjust the benchmark return and portfolio return for purposes of comparison.

Example: "The Family Trust accounts may invest in U.S. equity, U.S. fixed income, U.S. money market, and Developed Country international equity securities. The following benchmarks have been selected for comparison to each asset class: U.S. equity: Russell 3000 index; U.S. fixed income: Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index; U.S. money market: Lipper U.S. Government Money Market Average; Developed Country international equity securities: MSCI EAFE index."

Define distribution/spending assumptions or policies. Spending or distributions from the portfolio should be defined.

Example: "Based on the overall expected portfolio return of  $7.5\%$ , fees of  $1.2\%$ , inflation of  $2.8\%$ , and an effective tax rate of  $32\%$  of total appreciation, the Linzer Trust Portfolio may support an annual spending rate of  $1.2\%$  of the portfolio market value while retaining potential for capital preservation or nominal growth."

Define a policy portfolio to serve as a basis for performance and risk assessments. An asset allocation policy should designate target allocations to each asset class, with allowable ranges around the targets.

3c. Determine the risk tolerance of the investor.

Describe the investor's general philosophy regarding tolerance of risk. The IPS should acknowledge the assumption of risk and the potential for returns associated with risk to be both positive and negative over time. Relevant risks are usually myriad, and may include liquidity, legal, political, regulatory, longevity, mortality, business, and/or health risks.


Example: "Tower Advisors understands that an absolute loss in any 12-month period of more than  $-33\%$  is intolerable."

3d. Describe relevant constraints. Investors must address a variety of constraints that affect their investment programs. Such constraints may reflect legal or regulatory imperatives or may reflect internal policies.

Define an evaluation horizon for achievement of performance objectives.

Establishing a minimum time horizon for achievement of performance objectives makes clearer when action may need to be taken to resolve underperformance issues.

Example: "The basis for evaluation of relative success in achieving investment objectives will be on a rolling 8-quarter basis."

Identify any requirements for maintaining liquidity. Investors may have short- or medium-term needs for cash, which should be specified in the IPS.

Example: "Up to  $15\%$  of the market value of the portfolio should be invested such that it could be liquidated upon five days' notice without suffering capital depreciation."

Identify to what extent, if any, tax considerations shall affect investment decision making. The investor's general tax situation as well as specific tax issues should be accounted for in the investment policy statement.

Identify any relevant legal constraints.

Example: "Management of the Aquilla Family Foundation account is subject to the provisions of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act."

Specify any policies related to leverage. The ability to leverage portfolios may be constrained by policy or relevant statute.

Example: "At the discretion of Tower Advisors as investment manager, the Xie Weng portfolio may be marginined up to  $50\%$  of its value."

3e. Describe other considerations relevant to investment strategy.

Identify special factors to be used in including or excluding potential investments from the portfolio. Investors may choose to impose limits on certain investments, consistent with their beliefs in extra-financial factor effects on securities prices.

Example for an Individual Investor: "Consistent with her personal beliefs, no investments in companies that derive revenue from products or services that are contrary to the teachings of the Catholic Church will be made for Jennifer Jensen's account."

4. Risk Management and Performance Review

4a. Establish performance measurement and reporting accountabilities. The IPS should establish an objective, reliable mechanism for reporting on investment performance.

Example for an Individual Investor: "Hill Counsel will calculate and report the performance of each investment account by the 15th day of the new quarter. Calculations will be performed consistent with the Global Investment Performance Standards published by CFA Institute."

4b. Specify appropriate metrics for risk measurement and evaluation. Consistent use of metrics to assess and evaluate the risk profile of investment portfolios is important to allow for meaningful comparisons over time.

Example for an Individual Investor: "In addition to performance reporting, Tower Capital shall report to the Marcel Family Trust trustees indicative risk metrics, such as the standard deviation and information ratio of portfolio returns relative to each portfolio's specified benchmark."

4c. Define a process by which portfolios are rebalanced to target allocations.

Boundaries of acceptable variations from target should be specified.

Example for an Individual Investor: "On the first business day of each new quarter, the investment adviser for the Jensen personal accounts will propose rebalancing transactions to return the accounts to their target allocations, and shall execute these transactions within two business days."

# 28.5 Asset Allocation

Consideration of their objectives and constraints leads investors to a set of investment policies. The policies column in Table 28.3 lists the various dimensions of portfolio management policymaking—asset allocation, diversification, risk and tax positioning, and income generation. By far the most important part of policy determination is asset allocation, that is, deciding how much of the portfolio to invest in each major asset category.

We can view the process of asset allocation as consisting of the following steps:

1. Specify asset classes to be included in the portfolio. The major classes usually considered are the following:

$a$ . Money market instruments (usually called cash).
$b$ . Fixed-income securities (usually called bonds).
c. Stocks, both U.S. and non-U.S.
d. Real estate.
e. Precious metals.
$f$ . Alternative assets such as private equity or hedge funds.

2. Specify capital market expectations. This step consists of using both historical data and economic analysis to determine your expectations of future rates of return over the relevant holding period on the assets to be considered for inclusion in the portfolio. (Look back at Figure 28.1 and Table 28.1, and you will see that the CFA Institute classifies this part of the planning process as the formation of "capital market expectations.")
3. Derive the efficient portfolio frontier. This step consists of finding portfolios that achieve the maximum expected return for any given degree of risk.
4. Find the optimal asset mix. This step consists of selecting the efficient portfolio that best meets your risk and return objectives while satisfying the constraints you face. Given the risk-return positioning of the investor and the set of expectations, an optimal asset mix may be formed (see Panel II, Execution, in Table 28.1).

# Top-Down Asset Allocation for Institutional Investors

Individual investors need not concern themselves with organizational efficiency. But professional investors with large amounts to invest must structure asset allocation activities to decentralize some of the decision making.

Common features of large organizations are the investment committee and the asset universe. The investment committee includes top management officers, senior portfolio managers, and senior security analysts. The committee determines investment policies and verifies that portfolio managers and security analysts are operating within the bounds of specified policies. A major responsibility of the investment committee is to translate the objectives and constraints of the company into an asset universe, an approved list of assets for each of the company's portfolios.


The investment committee has responsibility for broad asset allocation. While the investment manager might have some leeway to tilt the portfolio toward or away from one or another asset class, the investment committee establishes the benchmark allocation that largely determines the risk characteristics of the portfolio. The task of choosing specific securities from the approved universe is more fully delegated to the investment manager.

Figure 28.2 illustrates the stages of the portfolio choice process for Palatial Investments, a hypothetical firm that invests internationally. The first two stages are asset allocation choices. The broadest choice is in the weighting of the portfolio between U.S. and Japanese securities. Palatial has chosen a weight of  $75\%$  in the United States and  $25\%$  in Japan. The allocation of the portfolio across asset classes may now be determined. For example,  $15\%$  of the U.S. portfolio is invested in cash equivalents,  $40\%$  in fixed income, and  $45\%$  in equity. The asset-class weights are, in general, a policy decision of the investment committee, although investment managers might have some authority to alter the asset allocation to limited degrees based on their expectations concerning the investment performance of various asset classes. Finally, security selection within each country is determined by the portfolio manager from the approved universe. For example,  $45\%$  of funds held in the U.S. equity market will be placed in IBM,  $35\%$  in GM, and  $20\%$  in ExxonMobil. (We show only three securities in the figure because of space limitations. Obviously a 1 billion fund will hold securities of many more firms.)

These ever-finer decisions determine the proportion of each individual security in the overall portfolio. As an example, consider the proportion of Palatial's portfolio invested in ExxonMobil,  $6.75\%$ . This fraction results from the following decisions: First, the United States receives a weight of  $75\%$  of the overall portfolio, and equities comprise  $45\%$  of the U.S. component of the portfolio. These are asset allocation choices. ExxonMobil comprises  $20\%$  of the U.S. equity component of the portfolio. This is a security selection choice. Therefore, ExxonMobil's weight in the overall portfolio is  $.75 \times .45 \times .20 = .0675$ , or  $6.75\%$ . If the entire portfolio is $1 billion, $67,500,000 will be invested in ExxonMobil. If ExxonMobil is selling for 45 a share, 1.5 million shares must be purchased. The bottom line in Figure 28.2 shows the percentage of the overall portfolio held in each asset.

Figure 28.2 Asset allocation and security selection for Palatial Investments


This example illustrates a top-down approach that is consistent with the needs of large organizations. The top managers set the overall policy of the portfolio by specifying asset allocation guidelines. Lower-level portfolio managers fill in the details with their security selection decisions.

# Monitoring and Revising the Portfolio

Choosing the investment portfolio requires the investor to set objectives, acknowledge constraints, determine asset-class proportions, and perform security analysis. Is the process ever finished and behind us? By the time we have completed all of these steps, many of the inputs we have used will be out of date. Moreover, investor circumstances as well as objectives change over time. Therefore, the investment process requires that we continually monitor and update our portfolios. This is the task of rebalancing, part of the feedback process described earlier in Table 28.1 and Figure 28.1.

Asset allocation also will change over time as the investment performance of different asset classes diverges. If the stock market outperforms the bond market, the proportion of your portfolio invested in stocks will increase while the proportion invested in bonds will decrease. If you are uncomfortable with this shift in the asset mix, you must rebalance the portfolio by selling some of the stocks and purchasing bonds.

Therefore, investing is a dynamic process, meaning that you must continually update and reevaluate your decisions over time.

# 28.6 Managing Portfolios of Individual Investors

Now that we have outlined general considerations for investment policy, we can look at the particular issues that confront a range of investors. We begin with issues relevant to individuals.

# Investment in Residence

The first major economic asset many people acquire is their own house. Deciding to buy rather than rent a residence qualifies as an investment decision.

An important consideration in assessing the risk and return aspects of this investment is the value of a house as a hedge against two kinds of risk. The first is the risk of increases in rental rates, which make housing services more expensive. If you own a house, this increase in the cost of housing (bad news) will increase the return on your investment in housing (good news, and therefore a hedge).

The second kind of risk is that the particular house or apartment where you live may not always be available to you. By buying, you guarantee its availability.

# Saving for Retirement and the Assumption of Risk

People save and invest money to provide for future consumption and leave an estate. The primary aim of lifetime savings is to allow maintenance of the customary standard of living after retirement. As Figure 28.3 suggests, your retirement consumption depends on your life expectancy at that time. Life expectancy, conditional on retirement at age 66, www.glasbergen.com.

approximates 86 years, so the average retiree needs to prepare a 20-year nest egg as well as sufficient savings to cover unexpected health care costs or the "risk" of living longer and outlasting your savings. Investment income may also increase the welfare of one's heirs, favorite charity, or both.

# Retirement Planning Models

There are many online retirement planners. You can find links to several of them at the American Savings Educational Council (ASEC) website: www .choosefosave.org/calculators/. (ASEC is a program of the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Look for their calculator under the Tools tab.) These calculators all follow similar logic. First, estimate the value of your total assets as of the date you retire. This will depend on your current assets, your projected savings rate, and the projected rate of return. Using this forecast of retirement wealth, an assumed interest rate at retirement, and a life expectancy, you can calculate the annual income annuity your retirement wealth can generate. Then you add the income you might continue to receive in retirement, for example, from

Social Security, a defined-benefit pension plan, or part-time work. The resulting estimate of total retirement income is then compared to your current wage and its forecasted growth rate to give you a forecast of your "replacement rate" income: the fraction of your salary in your last working year that you will continue to receive in retirement. If the replacement rate is too low, you need to consider either a more aggressive savings plan or a later age of retirement.

Figure 28.4 shows the results of this sort of analysis from ASEC's "Ballpark E\$timate" calculator. There are 16 inputs. The calculator reports both your replacement rate based on current assumptions (in this case  $71\%$ ) as well as the savings rate necessary to support your targeted replacement rate (here chosen to be  $90\%$ ).

This is actually a very simple example of available calculators. Others can determine appropriate interest rates for you based on market data and can enforce consistency across your inputs (e.g., between interest and inflation rates). In addition, rather than a single scenario, they can perform statistical simulation models that allow for uncertainty in wage growth, rates of return, inflation rates, and so on, thus providing for probabilistic assessments of the likelihood of meeting retirement goals.

# Target Date Funds

A target-date retirement fund (TDRF) is a fund composed of other funds, diversified across stocks, bonds, and money market accounts, in which the asset allocation becomes progressively more conservative as the investor approaches retirement. TDRFs are often advocated as a simple solution to the complex task of determining the appropriate asset allocation among funds in 401(k) plans, IRAs, and other personal investment accounts. TDRFs are marketed as enabling individuals to put their investment plans on autopilot. Once you choose a fund with a target year matching your investment horizon, the life-cycle manager gradually moves some of your money out of stocks and into bonds as your retirement date nears.

# Tax Sheltering and Asset Allocation

Three important tax deferral options can meaningfully affect optimal asset allocation for individual investors. Tax deferral generally refers to putting off investment taxes until the future, thus allowing your portfolio to grow at a tax-free or at least tax-advantaged rate.

One tax-deferral option derives from the fact that you do not have to pay tax on a capital gain until that gain is realized. Under the U.S. tax code, capital gains taxes are paid only when the asset is sold. Delaying the sale thus delays the tax bill. Therefore, investing in stocks (where a substantial component of total return is in the form of capital gains versus dividend income), may be preferred to bonds (where the dominant portion of total return is in the form of immediately taxed interest income). Moreover, the tax rate on realized capital gains is generally lower than the rate paid on interest income.


The second major tax-deferral option derives from tax-protected retirement plans such as individual retirement accounts (IRAs) or 401(k) plans. In so-called traditional plans contributions to your retirement account are not subject to federal income tax until you withdraw funds during retirement. We therefore say that these contributions are funded with pretax income. Investment earnings also are not taxed until they are withdrawn from the account. In contrast, in Roth-style plans (named after the late Senator William Roth of Delaware), you pay taxes on your income in the year it is earned, and therefore fund your retirement plan with after-tax dollars. However, the investment income earned in these plans is then exempt from taxes when withdrawn in future years.

Finally, investment products such as tax-deferred annuities offered by life insurance companies combine deferral of taxes with the option to ultimately withdraw one's funds in the form of a lifetime annuity. Because these annuities continue for your entire lifetime, they offer longevity insurance: You do not have to worry about outliving your savings. The insurance company assumes your mortality risk. Variable annuity contracts also allow you to invest the funds backing your policy in a variety of mutual funds. The amount one can contribute to a deferred annuity is unlimited but is not tax-deductible. On the other hand, investment earnings in the account are not taxed. In this respect, they are similar in tax treatment to Roth-style accounts.

The Tax-Deferral Option A fundamental feature of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code is that tax on a capital gain on an asset is payable only when the asset is sold; this is its tax-deferral option. The investor therefore can control the timing of the tax payment. This conveys a benefit to stock investments.

To see this, compare IBM stock with an IBM bond. Suppose both offer an expected total (pretax) return of  $12\%$ . The stock has a dividend yield of  $4\%$  and expected price appreciation of  $8\%$ , whereas the bond pays an interest rate of  $12\%$ . The bond investor must pay tax on the bond's interest in the year it is earned, whereas the stockholder pays tax only on the dividend and defers paying capital gains tax until the stock is sold.

Suppose one invests 1,000 for five years. Although in reality interest is taxed as ordinary income while capital gains and dividends are taxed at a rate of only 15\% for many investors,[2] to isolate the benefit of tax deferral, we will assume that all investment income is taxed at 15\%. The bond will earn an after-tax return of 12\% \times (1 - .15) = 10.2\%. The after-tax accumulation at the end of five years is

$$
\$ 1,000 \times 1.102 ^ {5} = \$ 1,625.20
$$

For the stock, the dividend yield after taxes is  $4\% \times (1 - .15) = 3.4\%$ . Because no taxes are paid on the  $8\%$  annual capital gain until year 5, the before-tax accumulation will be

$$
\$ 1,000 \times (1 + .034 + .08) ^ {5} = 1,000 (1.114) ^ {5} = \$ 1,715.64
$$

In year 5, when the stock is sold, the (now-taxable) capital gain is

$$
\$ 1,715.64 - \$ 1,000 (1.034) ^ {5} = 1,715.64 - 1,181.96 = \$ 533.68
$$

Before selecting an investment adviser, you should know what services you're paying for, how much those services cost, how the adviser gets paid, and what conflicts of interest the adviser may have when giving you investment advice. If you have a registered investment adviser, review the firm's brochure when you first receive it and when it is updated by the firm—there's a wealth of valuable information in there! And if you don't recall receiving the brochure, request it. You can also find the brochure on the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) Web site.

Here are some of the questions to ask when evaluating an investment adviser:

1. Are you registered with the SEC, a state, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)?
2. Have you or your firm ever been disciplined by any regulator? If yes, for what reasons and how was the matter resolved?

3. Have you ever been sued by a client who was not happy with your work, the services you provided, or the products you recommended?
4. How are you paid for your services? What is your usual hourly rate, flat fee, or commission?
5. What experience do you have, especially with people in my circumstances?
6. Where did you go to school? What is your recent employment history?
7. What products and services do you offer? Are you only supposed to recommend a limited number of products or services to me? If so, why?

Taxes due are  $80.05, leaving$ 1,635.59, which is 10.39 more than the bond investment yields. Deferral of the capital gains tax allows the investment to compound at a faster rate until the tax is actually paid. The more of one's total return that is in the form of price appreciation, the greater the value of the tax-deferral option.

Tax-Protected Retirement Plans Recent years have seen increased use of tax-protected retirement plans in which investors can choose how to allocate assets. Such plans include traditional IRAs, Keogh plans, and employer-sponsored "tax-qualified" defined contribution plans such as 401(k) plans. A feature these so-called traditional plans have in common is that contributions and earnings are not subject to federal income tax until the individual withdraws them as benefits.

Typically, an individual may have some investments in the form of such qualified retirement accounts and some in the form of ordinary taxable accounts. The basic tax-sheltering principle is to hold whatever bonds you want to hold in the retirement account while holding equities in the ordinary account. You maximize the tax advantage of the retirement account by holding it in the security that is the least tax advantaged.

To see this point, consider an investor who has  $200,000 of wealth, of which$ 100,000 is in a tax-qualified retirement account. She currently invests half of her wealth in bonds and half in stocks, so she allocates half of her retirement account and half of her nonretirement funds to each. She could reduce her tax bill with no change in before-tax returns simply by shifting her bonds into the retirement account and holding all her stocks outside the retirement account.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/6361c75c-7c74-4d6c-888c-4b31d441c5ca/605d78efd2f5e9a0cf26e19e72f36da733efeec9db461ad81209389d5742d7fc.jpg)

# Concept Check 28.2

Suppose our investor earns a  $10\%$  per year rate of interest on bonds and a  $15\%$  per year return on stocks, with all earnings reinvested. In five years, she will withdraw all her funds and spend them. By how much will she increase her final accumulation if she shifts all bonds into the retirement account and holds all stocks outside the retirement account? Assume the tax rate on interest income as well as the tax rate on ordinary income is  $28\%$ , while the tax rate on capital gains is  $15\%$ . Also assume that equity income is entirely in the form of capital gains, on which taxes are not paid until the investor cashes in the fund in five years.

Traditional IRA and  $401(\mathrm{k})$  plans allow investors to avoid taxes on current income because the funds contributed to the retirement plan are not taxed in the current year. But all the proceeds (both the original contribution and the subsequent investment earnings) are taxed at withdrawal. In contrast, Roth plans allow investors to contribute after-tax income to the retirement plan (so there is no tax break in the current year), but they then avoid taxation of future investment income. To compare the plans, think about an employee in a  $30\%$  tax bracket with $10,000 in income that will be invested in either a traditional or Roth tax-sheltered plan. Assume that the invested funds will earn  $8\%$  per year and be invested for 20 years, at which point the worker will retire.

Suppose first that the 10,000 is put in a traditional IRA or 401(k) plan. The worker actually forgoes only 7,000 in current consumption, as 30\% of that money would have been taxed had it not been sheltered in the retirement plan. The 10,000 will grow after 20 years to 10,000 \times 1.08^{20} = \46,609.57 . But when the worker withdraws the funds, they are fully taxable, so net-of-tax proceeds are only \46,609.57 \times (1 - .30) = \32,626.70

In a Roth plan, taxes are paid on the  $10,000 of income in the year it is earned. So only$ 7,000 is available to invest. But the investment earnings are all tax-free, so the funds will grow to  $7,000 \times 1.08^{20} = \$ 32,626.70$ with no further tax liability—exactly the same as under the traditional plan. At first glance, it looks like the traditional and Roth plans are equally attractive. In one case, you pay 30\% taxes on the original value; in the other, you pay 30\% on the final accumulated value. But there are some salient differences.

First, if your tax rate will change over time, you may prefer one plan over the other. For those who believe that their income (and therefore their marginal tax rate) will be significantly lower in retirement, the traditional plan may be preferred, as the tax savings when the contribution is made are greater than the tax rate paid when funds are withdrawn in retirement. On the other hand, if you predict an increase in tax rates, you may prefer the Roth plan.

When the funds that can be put into a plan are limited by law (as is the case in the U.S.), the Roth plan offers a more subtle advantage. Suppose you may put a maximum of  $10,000 into a 401(k) plan. Under the traditional plan, you can put aside at most$ 10,000 in pretax dollars (equivalent to $7,000 in after-tax dollars at a tax rate of 30\%). In the Roth plan, you can put aside $10,000 in after-tax dollars, equivalent to 13,333 in pretax dollars.

Deferred Annuities Deferred annuities are essentially tax-sheltered accounts offered by life insurance companies. They combine deferral of taxes with the option of withdrawing one's funds in the form of a life annuity. Variable annuity contracts offer the additional advantage of mutual fund investing. One major difference between an IRA and a variable annuity contract is that whereas the amount one can contribute to an IRA is tax-deductible and extremely limited as to maximum amount, the amount one can contribute to a deferred annuity is unlimited, but the contribution is not tax-deductible.

The defining characteristic of a life annuity is that its payments continue as long as the recipient is alive, although virtually all deferred annuity contracts have several withdrawal options, including a lump sum of cash paid out at any time. You need not worry about running out of money before you die. Like Social Security, therefore, life annuities offer longevity insurance.

There are two types of life annuities: fixed annuities and variable annuities. A fixed annuity pays a fixed nominal sum of money per period (usually each month), whereas a variable annuity pays a periodic amount linked to the investment performance of some underlying portfolio. Therefore, the investment risk of the underlying asset portfolio is borne by the recipient.

There are two stages in a variable annuity contract: an accumulation phase and a payout phase. During the accumulation phase, the investor contributes money periodically to one or more open-end mutual funds and accumulates shares. The second, or payout, stage usually starts at retirement, when the investor typically has several options, including the following:


1. Taking the market value of the shares in a lump-sum payment.
2. Receiving a fixed annuity until death.
3. Receiving a variable amount of money each period that depends on the investment performance of the portfolio.

Variable and Universal Life Insurance Variable life insurance is another tax-deferred investment vehicle offered by the life insurance industry. A variable life insurance policy combines life insurance with the tax-deferred annuities described earlier.

To invest in this product, you pay either a single premium or a series of premiums. In each case there is a stated death benefit, and the policyholder can allocate the money invested to several portfolios, which generally include a money market fund, a bond fund, and at least one common stock fund.

Variable life insurance policies offer a death benefit that is the greater of the stated face value or the market value of the investment base. In other words, the death benefit may rise with favorable investment performance, but it will not drop below the guaranteed face value.

The insured can gain access to the investment without having to pay income tax by borrowing against the cash surrender value. Policy loans of up to  $90\%$  of the cash value are available at any time at a contractually specified interest rate.

A universal life insurance policy is similar to a variable life policy except that, instead of having a choice of portfolios to invest in, the policyholder earns a rate of interest that is set by the insurance company and changed periodically as market conditions change. The disadvantage of universal life insurance is that the company sets the policyholder's rate of return, and, although companies may change the rate in response to competitive pressures, changes are not automatic.

# 28.7 Pension Funds

Pension plans are defined by the terms specifying the "who," "when," and "how much," for both the plan benefits and the plan contributions used to pay for those benefits. The pension fund of the plan is the cumulation of assets created from contributions and the investment earnings on those contributions, less any payments of benefits from the fund. In the U.S., contributions to the fund by either employer or employee are tax-deductible, and investment income of the fund is not taxed. Distributions from the fund, whether to the employer or the employee, are taxed as ordinary income. There are two "pure" types of pension plans: defined contribution and defined benefit.

# Defined Contribution Plans

In a defined contribution plan, a formula specifies contributions made by and on behalf of employees but does not promise the benefits to which they will be entitled. Contribution rules usually are specified as a predetermined fraction of salary (e.g., the employer contributes  $5\%$  of the employee's annual wages to the plan), although that fraction need not be constant over the course of an employee's career. The pension fund consists of a set of individual investment accounts, one for each employee. Pension benefits are not specified. The employee often has some choice over both the level of contributions and the way the account is invested.

Often, the employee can invest from a menu of mutual funds. The employee bears all the investment risk, and the employer has no legal obligation beyond making its periodic contributions.

A defined contribution plan is nearly identical to a tax-qualified individual retirement account. Indeed, the main providers of investment products for these plans are the same institutions such as mutual funds and insurance companies that serve the general investment needs of individuals. Therefore, in a defined contribution plan, much of the task of setting and achieving the income-replacement goal falls on the employee.

# Concept Check 28.3

An employee is 45 years old. Her salary is  $60,000 per year, and she has$ 100,000 accumulated in her self-directed defined contribution pension plan. Each year she contributes 5\% of her salary to the plan, and her employer matches it with another 5\%. She plans to retire at age 65.

Her retirement plan offers a choice of two funds: a guaranteed return fund that pays a risk-free real interest rate of  $3\%$  per year and a stock index fund that has an expected real rate of return of  $6\%$  per year and a standard deviation of  $20\%$ . Her current asset mix in the plan is  $\$50,000$  in the guaranteed fund and  $\$50,000$  in the stock index fund. She plans to reinvest all investment earnings in each fund in that same fund and to allocate her annual contribution equally between the two funds. If her salary grows at the same rate as the cost of living (so her real contributions to each fund will be constant), how much can she expect to have at retirement? How much can she be sure of having?

# Defined Benefit Plans

Whereas defined contribution plans specify the contributions made on behalf of employees, defined benefit plans specify the retirement benefits to which the employee is entitled. The firm is responsible for ensuring that funding will be adequate to provide those benefits. The benefit formula typically takes into account years of service for the employer and level of wages or salary (e.g., an employer might pay an employee for life, beginning at age 65, a yearly amount equal to  $2\%$  of final annual wage for each year of service). The employer (called the plan sponsor) or an insurance company hired by the sponsor guarantees the benefits and thus absorbs the investment risk.

As measured by the value of total pension liabilities, the defined benefit form still dominates in most countries around the world. However, the strong trend since the mid-1970s has been for sponsors, at least in the private sector, to choose the defined contribution form when starting new plans. But the two plan types are not mutually exclusive. Some sponsors adopt defined benefit plans as their primary plan, in which participation is mandatory, and supplement them with voluntary defined contribution plans.

With defined benefit plans, there is an important distinction between the pension plan and the pension fund. The plan is the contractual arrangement setting out the rights and obligations of all parties; the fund is a separate pool of assets set aside to provide collateral for the promised benefits. There may be no separate fund, in which case the plan is said to be unfunded. When there is a separate fund with assets worth less than the present value of the promised benefits, the plan is underfunded. And if the plan's assets have a market value that exceeds the present value of the plan's liabilities, it is said to be overfunded.

# Concept Check 28.4

An employee currently earning 60,000 a year is 40 years old and has been working for the firm for 15 years. The pension plan promises benefits in retirement of 2 \%of final salary times years of service. If normal retirement age is 65, the interest rate is 8 \%, and the employee’s life expectancy is 85, what is the present value of the accrued pension benefit?

# Pension Investment Strategies

The special tax status of pension funds creates the same incentive for both defined contribution and defined benefit plans to tilt their asset mix toward assets with the largest spread between pretax and after-tax rates of return. In a defined contribution plan, because the participant bears all the investment risk, the optimal asset mix also depends on the risk tolerance of the participant.

In defined benefit plans, optimal investment policy may be different because the sponsor absorbs the bulk of downside investment risk. If the sponsor has to share some of the upside potential of the pension assets with plan participants, there is an incentive to simply eliminate investment risk by investing in securities that match the promised benefits. If, for example, the plan sponsor has to pay  $100 per year for the next five years, it can provide this stream of benefit payments by buying a set of five zero-coupon bonds each with a face value of$ 100 and maturing sequentially. By so doing, the sponsor eliminates the risk of a shortfall. This is an example of immunization of the pension liability.

If the present value of promised pension benefits exceeds the market value of its assets, FASB Statement 87 requires that the corporation recognize the unfunded liability on its balance sheet. If, however, the pension assets exceed the present value of obligations, the corporation cannot include the surplus on its balance sheet. This asymmetric accounting treatment expresses a deeply held view about defined benefit pension funds. Representatives of organized labor, some politicians, and even some pension professionals believe that the sponsoring corporation, as guarantor of the accumulated pension benefits, is liable for pension asset shortfalls but does not have a clear right to the entire surplus in case of pension overfunding.

Investing in Equities If the only goal guiding corporate pension policy were shareholder wealth maximization, it is hard to understand why a financially sound pension sponsor would invest in equities at all. The tax advantage of a pension fund stems from the ability of the sponsor to earn the pretax interest rate on pension investments. To maximize the value of this tax shelter, it is necessary to invest entirely in assets offering the highest pretax interest rate. These will be the most tax disadvantaged assets, meaning that corporate pension funds should invest entirely in taxable bonds and other fixed-income investments.

Yet we know that, in general, pension funds invest from  $40\%$  to  $60\%$  of their portfolios in equity securities. Even a casual perusal of the practitioner literature suggests that they do so for a variety of reasons—some, but not all, legitimate. There are three possible correct reasons.

The first possibility is that corporate management views the pension plan as a trust for the employees and manages fund assets as if it were a defined contribution plan. It believes that a successful policy of investment in equities might allow it to pay extra benefits to employees and is therefore worth taking the risk.

The second possible correct reason is that management believes that through superior market timing and security selection, it is possible to create value in excess of management fees and expenses. Note that a very weak form of the efficient markets hypothesis would imply that management cannot create shareholder value simply by shifting the pension portfolio out of bonds and into stocks. Even when the entire pension surplus belongs to the shareholders, investing in stocks just moves the shareholders along the capital market line (the market trade-off between risk and return for passive investors) and does not create value. This implies that it makes sense for a pension fund to invest in equities only if it is able to pursue an active strategy that beats the market through either superior timing or security selection. A completely passive strategy will add no value to shareholders.

For an underfunded plan of a corporation in financial distress, there is another possible reason for investing in stocks and other risky assets—federal pension insurance. Firms in financial distress have an incentive to invest pension fund money in the riskiest assets. They may reason that if the invested assets do well and the firm recovers, it captures the benefit, but if the investment does poorly and the corporation becomes insolvent, the federal insurance program inherits the losses.

An incorrect, but common justification for a pension fund to invest in equities is that the expected rate of return on the pension-fund asset portfolio is often (albeit inappropriately) used to obtain the discount rate applied to find the present value of pension liabilities. By investing in higher risk-higher expected return securities, the discount rate is increased, which produces a lower present value of liabilities, and thus a rosier view of pension funding. But this reasoning is surely incorrect. The appropriate discount rate of the pension obligations depends on their risk, not the assets held to fund them. The asset composition of the pension fund should not be allowed to affect the assessment of the funding status of the plan.

# SUMMARY

1. When the principles of portfolio management are discussed, it is useful to distinguish among eight classes of investors:

$a$  Individual investors.
b. Personal trusts.
c. Mutual funds.
$d$  . Pension funds.
e. Endowment funds.
$f$ . Life insurance companies.
g. Non-life insurance companies.
h. Banks.

In general, these groups have somewhat different investment objectives, constraints, and portfolio policies.

2. To some extent, most institutional investors seek to match the risk-and-return characteristics of their investment portfolios to the characteristics of their liabilities.
3. The process of asset allocation includes the following steps:

$a$  . Specifying the asset classes to be included.
b. Defining capital market expectations.
c. Specifying the investor's objectives and constraints.
d. Determining the asset allocation that gives the best risk-return trade-off consistent with the investor's particular circumstances.

4. For investors who must pay taxes on their investment income, the process of asset allocation is complicated by the fact that they pay income taxes only on certain kinds of investment income. Interest income on munis is exempt from tax, and high-tax-bracket investors will prefer to hold them rather than short- and long-term taxable bonds. The more complex aspect of taxes is the fact that capital gains are taxable only if realized through the sale of an asset during the holding period.

5. The life-cycle approach to the management of an individual's investment portfolio views the individual as passing through a series of stages, becoming more risk averse in later years. The rationale underlying this approach is that as we age, we use up our human capital and have less time remaining to recoup possible portfolio losses through increased labor supply.

6. There are three ways to shelter investment income from federal income taxes besides investing in tax-exempt bonds: The first is by investing in assets whose returns take the form of appreciation in value, such as common stocks or real estate. As long as capital gains taxes are not paid until the asset is sold, the tax can be deferred indefinitely. The second is through investing in tax-deferred retirement plans such as IRAs. The third is to invest in the tax-advantaged products offered by the life insurance industry—tax-deferred annuities and variable and universal life insurance. They combine the flexibility of mutual fund investing with the tax advantages of tax deferral.
7. When allocating investment funds between tax-protected and other accounts, investors will minimize their overall tax burden by holding the least tax-advantaged asset (e.g., bonds) in their tax-protected accounts [e.g., IRAs or 401(k) plans]. The general investment rule is to hold the least tax-advantaged assets in the tax-protected plan and the most tax-advantaged assets outside of it.
8. Pension plans are either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. Defined contribution plans are in effect retirement funds held in trust for the employee by the employer. The employees in such plans bear all the risk of the plan's assets and often have some choice in the allocation of those assets. Defined benefit plans give the employees a claim to a money-fixed annuity at retirement. The annuity level is determined by a formula that takes into account years of service and the employee's wage or salary history.

b. A defined benefit pension fund with benefit obligations that have an average duration of 10 years. The benefits are not inflation-protected.
c. A defined benefit pension fund with benefit obligations that have an average duration of 10 years. The benefits are inflation-protected.

3. George More is a participant in a defined contribution pension plan that offers a fixed-income fund and a common stock fund as investment choices. He is 40 years old and has an accumulation of  $100,000 in each of the funds. He currently contributes$ 1,500 per year to each. He plans to retire at age 65, and his life expectancy is age 80.

PROBLEM SETS

4. The difference between a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA is that in a Roth IRA taxes are paid on the income that is contributed, but the withdrawals at retirement are tax-free. In a traditional IRA, however, the contributions reduce your taxable income, but the withdrawals at retirement are taxable. Assume you plan to devote 5,000 to retirement savings in each year. You will retire in 30 years and expect to live for an additional 20 years after retirement.

a. Assume the before-tax interest rate is  $5\%$ . What will be your after-tax 20-year retirement consumption stream if you choose to save in a traditional IRA? Assume your tax rate is fixed at  $30\%$ .
b. What will be your 20-year retirement consumption stream if you choose to save in a Roth IRA?
c. Which provides better expected results if you expect your tax rate on wage as well as all investment income to decrease from  $30\%$  today to  $25\%$  at retirement?

1. Angus Walker, CFA, is reviewing the defined benefit pension plan of Acme Industries. Based in London, Acme has operations in North America, Japan, and several European countries. Next month, the retirement age for full benefits under the plan will be lowered from age 60 to age 55.

The median age of Acme's workforce is 49 years. Walker is responsible for the pension plan's investment policy and strategic asset allocation decisions. The goals of the plan include achieving a minimum expected return of  $8.4\%$  with expected standard deviation no greater than  $16.0\%$ .

Walker is evaluating the current asset allocation (Table 28A) and selected financial information for the company (Table 28B). There is an ongoing debate within Acme Industries about the pension plan's investment policy statement (IPS). Two investment policy statements under consideration are shown in Table 28C.

5. Jarvis University (JU) is a private, multiprogram U.S. university with a  $2 billion endowment fund as of fiscal year-end May 31, 2030. With little government support, JU is heavily dependent on its endowment fund to support ongoing expenditures, especially because the university's enrollment growth and tuition revenue have not met expectations in recent years. The endowment fund must make a$ 126 million annual contribution, which is indexed to inflation, to JU's general operating budget. The U.S. Consumer Price Index is expected to rise 2.5\% annually and the U.S. higher education cost index is anticipated to rise 3\% annually. The endowment has also budgeted 200 million due on January 31, 2031, representing the final payment for construction of a new main library.

In a recent capital campaign, JU only met its fund-raising goal with the help of one very successful alumna, Valerie Bremner, who donated $400 million of Bertocchi Oil and Gas common stock at fiscal year-end May 31, 2030. Bertocchi Oil and Gas is a large-capitalization, publicly traded U.S. company. Bremner donated the stock on the condition that no more than  $25\%$  of the initial number of shares may be sold in any fiscal year. No substantial additional donations are expected in the future.

Given the large contribution to and distributions from the endowment fund, the endowment fund's investment committee has decided to revise the fund's investment policy statement. The investment committee also recognizes that a revised asset allocation may be warranted. The asset allocation in place for the JU endowment fund as of May 31, 2030, is given in Table 28E.

$a$ . Prepare the components of an appropriate investment policy statement for the Jarvis University endowment fund as of June 1, 2030, based only on the information given.

Note: Each component in your response must specifically address circumstances of the JU endowment fund.

6. Susan Fairfax is president of Reston Industries, a U.S.-based company whose sales are entirely domestic and whose shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The following are additional facts concerning her current situation:

- Fairfax is single, aged 58. She has no immediate family, has no debts, and does not own a residence. She is in excellent health and covered by Reston-paid health insurance that continues after her expected retirement at age 65.
- Her base salary of 500,000/year, inflation-protected, is sufficient to support her present lifestyle but can no longer generate any excess for savings.
- She has 2,000,000 of savings from prior years held in the form of short-term instruments.
- Reston rewards key employees through a generous stock-bonus incentive plan but provides no pension plan and pays no dividend.
- Fairfax's incentive plan participation has resulted in her ownership of Reston stock worth 10 million (current market value). The stock, received tax-free but subject to tax at a 35\% rate (on entire proceeds) if sold, is expected to be held at least until her retirement.
- Her present level of spending and the current annual inflation rate of  $4\%$  are expected to continue after her retirement.
- Fairfax is taxed at  $35\%$  on all salary, investment income, and realized capital gains. Assume her composite tax rate will continue at this level indefinitely.

Fairfax's orientation is patient, careful, and conservative in all things. She has stated that an annual after-tax real total return of  $3\%$  would be completely acceptable to her if it was achieved in a context where an investment portfolio created from her accumulated savings was not subject to a decline of more than  $10\%$  in nominal terms in any given 12-month period. To obtain the benefits of professional assistance, she has approached two investment advisory firms—HH Counselors (HH) and Coastal Advisors (Coastal)—for recommendations on allocation of the investment portfolio to be created from her existing savings assets (the Savings Portfolio) as well as for advice concerning investing in general.

a. Create and justify an investment policy statement for Fairfax based only on the information provided thus far. Be specific and complete in presenting objectives and constraints. (An asset allocation is not required in answering this question.) b. Coastal has proposed the asset allocation shown in Table 28F for investment of Fairfax's 2 million of savings assets. Assume that only the current yield portion of projected total return (comprised of both investment income and realized capital gains) is taxable to Fairfax and that the municipal bond income is entirely tax-exempt.

Critique the Coastal proposal. Include in your answer three weaknesses in the Coastal proposal from the standpoint of the investment policy statement you created for her in part  $(a)$ .

7. John Franklin is a recent widower with some experience in investing for his own account. Following his wife's recent death and settlement of the estate, Mr. Franklin owns a controlling interest in a successful privately held manufacturing company in which Mrs. Franklin was formerly active, a recently completed warehouse property, the family residence, and his personal holdings of stocks and bonds.

This gift will greatly increase the size of the foundation's endowment (from  $10 million to$ 55 million) as well as enable it to make larger grants to researchers. The foundation's grant-making (spending) policy has been to pay out virtually all of its annual net investment income. As its investment approach has been very conservative, the endowment portfolio now consists almost entirely of fixed-income assets. The finance committee understands that these actions are causing the real value of foundation assets and the real value of future grants to decline due to the effects of inflation. Until now, the finance committee has believed that it had no alternative to these actions, given the large immediate cash needs of the research programs being funded and the small size of the foundation's capital base. The foundation's annual grants must at least equal 5\% of its assets' market value to maintain its U.S. tax-exempt status, a requirement that is expected to continue indefinitely. No additional gifts or fund-raising activities are expected over the foreseeable future.


Given the change in circumstances that Mr. Franklin's gift will make, the finance committee wishes to develop new grant-making and investment policies. Annual spending must at least meet the level of  $5\%$  of market value that is required to maintain the foundation's tax-exempt status, but the committee is unsure about how much higher than  $5\%$  it can or should be. The committee wants to pay out as much as possible because of the critical nature of the research being funded; however, it understands that preserving the real value of the foundation's assets is equally important in order to preserve its future grant-making capabilities. You have been asked to assist the committee in developing appropriate policies.

a. Identify and briefly discuss the three key elements that should determine the foundation's grant-making (spending) policy.
b. Formulate and justify an investment policy statement for the foundation, taking into account the increased size of its assets arising from Mr. Franklin's gift. Your policy statement must encompass all relevant objectives, constraints, and the key elements identified in your answer to part (a).
c. Recommend and justify a long-term asset allocation that is consistent with the investment policy statement you created in part (b). Explain how your allocation's expected return meets the requirements of a feasible grant-making (spending) policy for the foundation. (Hint: Your allocation must sum to  $100\%$  and should use the economic/market data presented in Table 28H and your knowledge of historical asset-class characteristics.)

8. Christopher Maclin, aged 40, is a supervisor at Barnett Co. and earns an annual salary of £80,000 before taxes. Louise Maclin, aged 38, stays home to care for their newborn twins. She recently inherited £900,000 (after wealth-transfer taxes) in cash from her father's estate. In addition, the Maclins have accumulated the following assets (current market value):

£5,000 in cash.
£160,000 in stocks and bonds.
£220,000 in Barnett common stock.

The value of their holdings in Barnett stock has appreciated substantially as a result of the company's growth in sales and profits during the past 10 years. Christopher Maclin is confident that the company and its stock will continue to perform well.

The Maclins need £30,000 for a down payment on the purchase of a house and plan to make a £20,000 non-tax-deductible donation to a local charity in memory of Louise Maclin's father. The Maclins' annual living expenses are £74,000. After-tax salary increases will offset any future increases in their living expenses.

During their discussions with their financial advisor, Grant Webb, the Maclins express concern about achieving their educational goals for their children and their own retirement goals. The Maclins tell Webb:

- They want to have sufficient funds to retire in 18 years when their children begin their four years of university education.
- They have been unhappy with the portfolio volatility they have experienced in recent years and they do not want to experience a loss greater than  $12\%$  in any one year.
- They do not want to invest in alcohol and tobacco stocks.
- They will not have any additional children.

After their discussions, Webb calculates that in 18 years the Maclins will need £2 million to meet their educational and retirement goals. Webb suggests that their portfolio be structured to limit shortfall risk (defined as expected total return minus two standard deviations) to no lower than a  $-12\%$  return in any one year. Maclin's salary and all capital gains and investment income are taxed at  $40\%$  and no tax-sheltering strategies are available. Webb's next step is to formulate an investment policy statement for the Maclins.

$a$ . Formulate the risk objective of an investment policy statement for the Maclins.
$b$ . Formulate the return objective of an investment policy statement for the Maclins. Calculate the pretax rate of return that is required to achieve this objective. Show your calculations.
c. Formulate the constraints portion of an investment policy statement for the Maclins, addressing each of the following: i. Time horizon

ii. Liquidity requirements iii. Tax concerns
iv. Unique circumstances

9. Louise and Christopher Maclin (see Problem 8) have purchased their house and made the donation to the local charity. Now that an investment policy statement has been prepared for the Maclins, Grant Webb recommends that they consider the strategic asset allocation described in Table 28I.

<table><tr><td>Asset Class</td><td>Recommended Allocation</td><td>Current Yield</td><td>Projected Annualized Pretax Total Return</td><td>Expected Standard Deviation</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>15.0\%</td><td>1.0\%</td><td>1.0\%</td><td>2.5\%</td></tr><tr><td>U.K. corporate bonds</td><td>55.0</td><td>4.0</td><td>5.0</td><td>11.0</td></tr><tr><td>U.K. small-capitalization equities</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>11.0</td><td>25.0</td></tr><tr><td>U.K. large-capitalization equities</td><td>10.0</td><td>2.0</td><td>9.0</td><td>21.0</td></tr><tr><td>U.S. equities*</td><td>5.0</td><td>1.5</td><td>10.0</td><td>20.0</td></tr><tr><td>Barnett Co. common stock</td><td>15.0</td><td>1.0</td><td>16.0</td><td>48.0</td></tr><tr><td>Total portfolio</td><td>100.0</td><td>—</td><td>6.7</td><td>12.4</td></tr></table>

# Table 28J

Louise and Christopher Maclin's asset class ranges a. Identify aspects of the recommended asset allocation in Table 28I that are inconsistent with the Maclins' investment objectives and constraints. Support your responses.

b. After further discussion, Webb and the Maclins agree that any suitable strategic asset allocation will include  $5 - 10\%$  in U.K. small-capitalization equities and  $10 - 15\%$  in U.K. large-capitalization equities. For the remainder of the portfolio, Webb is considering the asset class ranges described in Table 28J.

Recommend the most appropriate allocation range for each of the asset classes in Table 28J. Justify each appropriate allocation range with a reason based on the Maclins' investment objectives and constraints.

Note: No calculations are required.

# E-INVESTMENTS EXERCISES

Vanguard offers suggestions about portfolio asset proportions based on your time frame and attitude toward risk: Start with its questionnaire and then proceed to its recommendations. See investor.vanguard.com/calculator-tools/investor-questionnaire/. After you run the calculator with your preferences, change your inputs slightly to see what effect that would have on the results.

Many mutual fund companies offer retirement planning calculators and tools on their Web sites. For example, T. Rowe Price allows you to input your age, salary, and current financial situation to estimate the probability that you will be able to retire on schedule with adequate income. Go to www.troweprice.com/usis/advice/tools/retirement-income-calculator. Other mutual funds such as Fidelity offer similar calculators. Look for its retirement planning tools.

# SOLUTIONS TO CONCEPT CHECKS

1. Identify the elements that are life cycle-driven in the two schemes of objectives and constraints.
2. If the investor keeps her present asset allocation, she will have the following amounts to spend after taxes five years from now:

Tax-qualified account:

$$
\text {B o n d s :} \\ 5 0, 0 0 0 (1. 1 0) ^ {5} \times . 7 2 = \\ 5 7, 9 7 8. 3 6
$$

$$
\text {S t o c k s :} \\ 5 0, 0 0 0 (1. 1 5) ^ {5} \times . 7 2 = \\ 7 2, 4 0 8. 8 6
$$

$$
\text {S u b t o t a l} \quad \$ 1 3 0, 3 8 7. 2 2
$$

Nonretirement account:

$$
\text {B o n d s :} \\ 5 0, 0 0 0 [ 1 + (. 1 0 \times . 7 2) ] ^ {5} = \\ 7 0, 7 8 5. 4 4
$$

$$
\text {S t o c k s :} \\ \underline {{\$ 5 0 , 0 0 0 (1 . 1 5) ^ {5} - . 1 5 \times [ 5 0 , 0 0 0 (1 . 1 5) ^ {5} - 5 0 , 0 0 0 ]}} = \underline {{\$ 9 2 , 9 8 2 . 6 8}}
$$

$$
\text {S u b t o t a l} \quad \$ 1 6 3, 7 6 8. 1 2
$$

$$
\text {T o t a l} \quad \$ 2 9 4, 1 5 5. 3 4
$$

If she shifts all of the bonds into the retirement account and all of the stock into the nonretirement account, she will have the following amounts to spend after taxes five years from now:

Tax-qualified account:

$$
\text {B o n d s :} \\ 1 0 0, 0 0 0 (1. 1 0) ^ {5} \times . 7 2 = \\ 1 1 5, 9 5 6. 7 2
$$

Nonretirement account:

$$
\text {S t o c k s :} \\ \mathbb {1 0 0 , 0 0 0 (1 . 1 5) ^ {5}} -. 1 5 \times [ 1 0 0, 0 0 0 (1. 1 5) ^ {5} - 1 0 0, 0 0 0 ] = \mathbb {1 8 5 , 9 6 5 . 3 6}
$$

$$
\text {T o t a l} = \$ 3 0 1, 9 2 2. 0 8
$$

Her final accumulation will increase by 7,766.74.

3. The total contribution to each fund (stock and guaranteed return fund) will be $3,000 per year (i.e., 5\% of $60,000) in constant dollars. At retirement she will have in her guaranteed return fund:

$$
\$ 50,000 \times 1.03 ^ {20} + \$ 3,000 \times \text {Future value annuity factor} (3 \%, 20 \text {years}) = \$ 170,917
$$

That is the amount she will have for sure because the value of her stock investment can, at least in principle, fall to zero.

In addition, the expected future value of her stock account is:

$$
\$ 50,000 \times 1.06 ^ {20} + \$ 3,000 \times \text {Future value annuity factor} (6 \%, 20 \text {years}) = \$ 270,714
$$

4. He has accrued an annuity of .02 × 15 × 60,000 = $18,000 per year that is expected to begin in 25 years (at age 65) and to last for 20 years (from age 65 to 85). The present value of this annuity is $25,805:

$$
\mathrm {PV} = \\mathbb {S} 18,000 \times \text {Annuity factor} (8 \% , 20) \times \mathrm {PV} \text {factor} (8 \% , 25) = \\mathbb {S} 25,805
$$
