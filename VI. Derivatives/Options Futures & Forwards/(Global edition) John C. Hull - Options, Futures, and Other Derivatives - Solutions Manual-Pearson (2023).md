# 1.1  

Selling a call option involves giving someone else the right to buy an asset from you. It gives you a payoff of  

$$
- \mathrm { m a x } ( S _ { T } - K , 0 ) = \mathrm { m i n } ( K - S _ { T } , 0 )
$$  

Buying a put option involves buying an option from someone else. It gives a payoff of  

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } ( K - S _ { \mathrm { } _ { T } } , 0 )
$$  

In both cases, the potential payoff is $K - S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T }$ . When you write a call option, the payoff is negative or zero. (This is because the counterparty chooses whether to exercise.) When you buy a put option, the payoff is zero or positive. (This is because you choose whether to exercise.)  

1.2  

(a) The investor is obligated to sell pounds for 1.3000 when they are worth 1.2900. The gain is $( 1 . 3 0 0 0 - 1 . 2 9 0 0 ) \times 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 = \mathbb { S } 1 , 0 0 0$ .   
(b) The investor is obligated to sell pounds for 1.3000 when they are worth 1.3200. The loss is $( 1 . 3 2 0 0 - 1 . 3 0 0 0 ) \times 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 = \mathbb { S } 2 , 0 0 0$  

1.3  

(a) The trader sells for 50 cents per pound something that is worth 48.20 cents per pound. $\mathrm { G a i n } = ( \mathbb { S } 0 . 5 0 0 0 - \mathbb { S } 0 . 4 8 2 0 ) \times 5 0 , 0 0 0 = \mathbb { S } 9 0 0$ .   
(b) The trader sells for 50 cents per pound something that is worth 51.30 cents per pound. $\mathrm { L o s s } = ( \mathbb { S } 0 . 5 1 3 0 - \mathbb { S } 0 . 5 0 0 0 ) \times 5 0 , 0 0 0 = \mathbb { S } 6 5 0$ .  

# 1.4  

You have sold a put option. You have agreed to buy 100 shares for $\$ 40$ per share if the party on the other side of the contract chooses to exercise the right to sell for this price. The option will be exercised only when the price of stock is below $\$ 40$ . Suppose, for example, that the option is exercised when the price is $\$ 30$ . You have to buy at $\$ 40$ shares that are worth $\$ 30$ ; you lose $\$ 10$ per share, or $\$ 1,000$ in total. If the option is exercised when the price is $\$ 20$ , you lose $\$ 20$ per share, or $\$ 2,000$ in total. The worst that can happen is that the price of the stock declines to almost zero during the three-month period. This highly unlikely event would cost you $\$ 4,000$ . In return for the possible future losses, you receive the price of the option from the purchaser.  

1.5 One strategy would be to buy 200 shares. Another would be to buy 2,000 options. If the share price does well, the second strategy will give rise to greater gains. For example, if the share price goes up to $\$ 40$ you gain $[ 2 , 0 0 0 \times ( \mathbb { S } 4 0 - \mathbb { S } 3 0 ) ] - \mathbb { S } 5 , 8 0 0 = \mathbb { S } 1 4 , 2 0 0$ from the second strategy and only $2 0 0 \times ( \mathbb { S } 4 0 - \mathbb { S } 2 9 ) = \mathbb { S } 2 , 2 0 0$ from the first strategy. However, if the share price does badly, the second strategy gives greater losses. For example, if the share price goes down to $\$ 25$ , the first strategy leads to a loss of $2 0 0 \times ( \mathbb { S } 2 9 - \mathbb { S } 2 5 ) = \mathbb { S } 8 0 0$  whereas the second strategy leads to a loss of the whole $\$ 5,800$ investment. This example shows that options contain built in leverage.  

# 1.6  

You could buy 50 put option contracts (each on 100 shares) with a strike price of $\$ 25$ and an expiration date in four months. If at the end of four months, the stock price proves to be less than $\$ 25$ , you can exercise the options and sell the shares for $\$ 25$ each.  

# 1.7  

An exchange-traded stock option provides no funds for the company. It is a security sold by one investor to another. The company is not involved. By contrast, a stock when it is first issued, is sold by the company to investors and does provide funds for the company.  

# 1.8  

If a trader has an exposure to the price of an asset, a hedge with futures contracts can be used. If the trader will gain when the price decreases and lose when the price increases, a long futures position will hedge the risk. If the trader will lose when the price decreases and gain when the price increases, a short futures position will hedge the risk. Thus, either a long or a short futures position can be entered into for hedging purposes.   
If the trader has no exposure to the price of the underlying asset, entering into a futures contract is speculation. If the trader takes a long position, there is a gain when the asset's price increases and a loss when it decreases. If the trader takes a short position, there is a loss when the asset's price increases and a gain when it decreases.  

# 1.9  

The holder of the option will gain if the price of the stock is above $\$ 52.50$ in March. (This ignores the time value of money.) The option will be exercised if the price of the stock is above $\$ 50.00$ in March. The profit as a function of the stock price is shown in Figure S1.1.

# 1.10  

The seller of the option will lose money if the price of the stock is below $\$ 56.00$ in June. (This ignores the time value of money.) The option will be exercised if the price of the stock is below $\$ 60.00$ in June. The profit as a function of the stock price is shown in Figure S1.2.  

![](images/cf564906b42e0438c7653f48a3bfcd09dc686956477099fd17a9ac2852ec866e.jpg)

# 1.11  

The trader has an inflow of $\$ 2$ in May and an outflow of $\$ 5$ in September. The $\$ 2$ is the cash received from the sale of the option. The $\$ 5$ is the result of the option being exercised. The trader has to buy the stock for $\$ 25$ in September and sell it to the purchaser of the option for $\$ 20$ .  

# 1.12  

The trader makes a gain if the price of the stock is above $\$ 26$ at the time of exercise. (This ignores the time value of money.)  

# 1.13  

A long position in a four-month put option on the foreign currency can provide insurance against the exchange rate falling below the strike price. It ensures that the foreign currency can be sold for at least the strike price.  

# 1.14  

The company could enter into a long forward contract to buy 1 million Canadian dollars in six months. This would have the effect of locking in an exchange rate equal to the current forward exchange rate. Alternatively, the company could buy a call option giving it the right (but not the obligation) to purchase 1 million Canadian dollars at a certain exchange rate in six months. This would provide insurance against a strong Canadian dollar in six months while still allowing the company to benefit from a weak Canadian dollar at that time.  

# 1.15  

a) The trader sells 100 million yen for $\$ 0090$ per yen when the exchange rate is $\$ 0084$ per yen. The gain is $1 0 0 \times 0 . 0 0 0 6$ millions of dollars or $\$ 60,000$ . b) The trader sells 100 million yen for $\$ 0090$ per yen when the exchange rate is $\$ 0101$  

per yen. The loss is $1 0 0 \times 0 . 0 0 1 1$ millions of dollars or \$110,000.  

1.16 Most investors will use the contract because they want to do one of the following:  

a) Hedge an exposure to long-term interest rates.   
b) Speculate on the future direction of long-term interest rates.   
c) Arbitrage between the spot and futures markets for Treasury bonds.  

This contract is discussed in Chapter 6.  

# 1.17  

The statement means that the gain (loss) to one side equals the loss (gain) to the other side. In aggregate, the net gain to the two parties is zero.  

# 1.18  

The terminal value of the long forward contract is:  

$$
S _ { T } - F _ { 0 }
$$  

where $S _ { T }$ is the price of the asset at maturity and $F _ { 0 }$ is the delivery price (which is the same as the forward price of the asset at the time the portfolio is set up). The terminal value of the put option is:  

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } { ( F _ { 0 } - S _ { T } , 0 ) }
$$  

The terminal value of the portfolio is therefore,  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { S _ { T } - F _ { 0 } + \operatorname* { m a x } { ( F _ { 0 } - S _ { T } , 0 ) } } } \\ { { \mathrm { ~ \ = m a x ( 0 , } S _ { T } - F _ { 0 } ) } } \end{array}
$$  

This is the same as the terminal value of a European call option with the same maturity as the forward contract and a strike price equal to $F _ { 0 }$ . This result is illustrated in Figure S1.3. The profit equals the terminal value of the call option less the amount paid for the put option. (It does not cost anything to enter into the forward contract.)

Figure S1.3:  Profit from portfolio in Problem 1.18  

1.19 Suppose that the yen exchange rate (yen per dollar) at maturity of the ICON is $S _ { T }$ . The payoff  

from the ICON is,  

$$
\begin{array} { c c c } { { 1 , 0 0 0 } } & { { \mathrm { i f } } } & { { S _ { _ T } > 1 6 9 } } \\ { { } } & { { } } & { { } } \\ { { 1 , 0 0 0 - 1 , 0 0 0 \left( \frac { 1 6 9 } { S _ { _ T } } - 1 \right) } } & { { \mathrm { i f } } } & { { 8 4 . 5 \le S _ { _ T } \le 1 6 9 } } \\ { { } } & { { } } & { { } } \\ { { 0 } } & { { \mathrm { i f } } } & { { S _ { _ T } < 8 4 . 5 } } \end{array}
$$  

When $8 4 . 5 \leq S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } \leq 1 6 9$ the payoff can be written,  

$$
2 , 0 0 0 - \frac { 1 6 9 , 0 0 0 } { S _ { _ T } }
$$  

The payoff from an ICON is the payoff from:  

(a) A regular bond. (b) A short position in call options to buy 169,000 yen with an exercise price of 1/169. (c) A long position in call options to buy 169,000 yen with an exercise price of 1/84.5. is is demonstrated by the following table, which shows the terminal value of the various ponents of the position.  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Bond</td><td>Short Calls</td><td>Long Calls</td><td>Whole position</td></tr><tr><td>ST >169</td><td>1,000</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>84.5≤ S, ≤169</td><td>1,000</td><td>-169,000(（）</td><td>0</td><td>2,000-169,000/ST</td></tr><tr><td>Sr <84.5</td><td>1,000</td><td>-169,00(</td><td>169,000（）</td><td>0</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# 1.20  

Suppose that the forward price for the contract entered into on July 1, 2021, is $F _ { 1 }$ and that the forward price for the contract entered into on September 1, 2021, is $F _ { 2 }$ with both $F _ { 1 }$ and $F _ { _ 2 }$ being measured as dollars per yen. If the value of one Japanese yen (measured in US dollars) is $S _ { T }$ on January 1, 2022, then the value of the first contract (in millions of dollars) at that time is,  

$$
1 0 ( S _ { T } - F _ { 1 } )
$$  

while the value of the second contract at that time is:  

$$
1 0 ( F _ { 2 } - S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } )
$$  

The total payoff from the two contracts is therefore,  

$$
1 0 ( S _ { _ { T } } - F _ { 1 } ) + 1 0 ( F _ { 2 } - S _ { _ { T } } ) = 1 0 ( F _ { 2 } - F _ { 1 } )
$$  

Thus, if the forward price for delivery on January 1, 2022, increased between July 1, 2021, and September 1, 2021, the company will make a profit. (Note that the yen/USD exchange rate is usually expressed as the number of yen per USD not as the number of USD per yen.)  

# 1.21  

(a) The arbitrageur buys a 180-day call option and takes a short position in a 180-day forward contract. If $S _ { T }$ is the terminal spot rate, the profit from the call option is  

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } ( S _ { T } - 1 . 2 2 , 0 ) - 0 . 0 2
$$  

The profit from the short forward contract is  

The profit from the strategy is therefore  

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } ( S _ { T } - 1 . 2 2 , 0 ) - 0 . 0 2 + 1 . 2 5 1 8 - S _ { T }
$$  

This is $1 . 2 3 1 8  – S _ { T }$ when $S T { < } 1 . 2 2$ 0.0118 when $S _ { T } { > } 1 . 2 2$  

This shows that the profit is always positive. The time value of money has been ignored in these calculations. However, when it is taken into account the strategy is still likely to be profitable in all circumstances. (We would require an extremely high interest rate for $\$ 0118$ interest to be required on an outlay of $\$ 0.02$ over a 180-day period.)  

(b) The trader buys 90-day put options and takes a long position in a 90 day forward contract. If $S _ { T }$ is the terminal spot rate, the profit from the put option is  

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } ( 1 . 2 9 - S _ { T } , 0 ) - 0 . 0 2
$$  

The profit from the long forward contract is ST−1.2556   
The profit from this strategy is therefore $\operatorname* { m a x } ( 1 . 2 9 - S _ { T } , 0 ) - 0 . 0 2 + S _ { T } - 1 . 2 5 5 6$  

This is ${ S r ^ { - 1 . 2 7 5 6 } }$ when $S T { > } 1 { . } 2 9$ 0.0144 when $S T ^ { < 1 . 2 9 }$  

The profit is therefore always positive. Again, the time value of money has been ignored but is unlikely to affect the overall profitability of the strategy. (We would require interest rates to be extremely high for $\$ 0.0144$ interest to be required on an outlay of $\$ 0.02$ over a 90-day period.)  

# 1.22  

If the stock price is between $\$ 30$ and $\$ 33$ at option maturity the trader will exercise the option, but lose money on the trade. Consider the situation where the stock price is $\$ 31$ . If the trader exercises, she loses $\$ 2$ on the trade. If she does not exercise she loses $\$ 3$ on the trade. It is clearly better to exercise than not exercise.  

# 1.23  

The trader's maximum gain from the put option is $\$ 5$ . The maximum loss is $\$ 35$ , corresponding to the situation where the option is exercised and the price of the underlying asset is zero. If the option were a call, the trader’s maximum gain would still be \$5, but there would be no bound to the loss as there is in theory no limit to how high the asset price could rise.  

# 1.24  

If the stock price declines below the strike price of the put option, the stock can be sold for the strike price.  

# 1.25  

a) The upfront cost for the stock alternative is $\$ 31,450$ . The upfront cost for the option alternative is $\$ 2,170$ .   
b) The gain from the stock alternative is $\$ 40,000-831,650=\ S 8,350$ . The total gain from the option alternative is $( \mathbb { S } 4 0 0 - \mathbb { S } 3 2 0 ) \times 1 0 0 - \mathbb { S } 2 , 1 7 0 = \mathbb { S } 5 , 8 3 0$ .   
c) The loss from the stock alternative is $\$ 31,650-830,000$ . The loss from the option alternative is $\$ 2,170$ .  

# 1.26  

Arbitrage involves carrying out two or more different trades to lock in a profit. In this case, traders can buy shares on the TSX and sell them on the NYSE to lock in a USD profit of 50- $6 0 / 1 . 2 1 { = } 0 . 4 1$ per share. As they do this, the NYSE price will fall and the TSX price will rise so that the arbitrage opportunity disappears.  

# 1.27 (Excel file)  

Trader A makes a profit of $S _ { T } - 1 , 0 0 0$ and Trader B makes a profit of max $( S _ { T } - 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 ) -$ 100 where $S _ { T }$ is the price of the asset in one year. Trader A does better if $S _ { T }$ is above $\$ 900$ as indicated in Figure S1.4.  

![](images/c64266c24fe48eb041f88738838d0598a03805786f42e4a44df2c7560e741880.jpg)  
Figure S1.4: Profit to Trader A and Trader B in Problem 1.27  

# 1.28  

The investor has agreed to buy 100 shares of the stock for $\$ 40$ in July (or earlier) if the party on the other side of the transaction chooses to sell. The trade will prove profitable if the option is not exercised or if the stock price is above $\$ 37$ at the time of exercise. The risk to the investor is that the stock price plunges to a low level. For example, if the stock price drops to $\$ 1$ by July, the investor loses $\$ 3,400$ . This is because the put options are exercised and $\$ 40$ is paid for 100 shares when the value per share is $\$ 1$ . This leads to a loss of $\$ 3,900$ which is only a little offset by the premium of $\$ 300$ received for the options.  

# 1.29  

The company could enter into a forward contract obligating it to buy 3 million euros in three months for a fixed price (the forward price). The forward price will be close to but not exactly the same as the current spot price of 1.1500. An alternative would be to buy a call option giving the company the right but not the obligation to buy 3 million euros for a particular exchange rate (the strike price) in three months. The use of a forward contract locks in, at no cost, the exchange rate that will apply in three months. The use of a call option provides, at a cost, insurance against the exchange rate being higher than the strike price.  

# 1.30 (Excel file)  

This is known as a bull spread (see Chapter 12). The profit is shown in Figure S1.5.  

![](images/38cbacba8bd7baff7831db79cc3eb1d634814106942ae975e80af5254b2c4e9c.jpg)  
Figure S1.5: Profit in Problem 1.30  

# 1.31  

The arbitrageur should borrow money to buy a certain number of ounces of gold today and short forward contracts on the same number of ounces of gold for delivery in one year. This means that gold is purchased for $\$ 1,200$ per ounce and sold for $\$ 1,300$ per ounce. Interest on the borrowed funds will be $0 . 0 3 \times \$ 1, 20 0$ or $\$ 36$ per ounce. A profit of $\$ 64$ per ounce will therefore be made.  

# 1.32  

The second alternative involves what is known as a stop or stop-loss order. It costs nothing and ensures that $\$ 29,000$ , or close to $\$ 29,000$ , is realized for the holding in the event the stock price ever falls to $\$ 290$ . The put option costs $\$ 2,130$ and guarantees that the holding can be sold for $\$ 29,000$ any time up to December. If the stock price falls marginally below $\$ 290$ and then rises the option will not be exercised, but the stop-loss order will lead to the holding being liquidated. There are some circumstances where the put option alternative leads to a better outcome and some circumstances where the stop-loss order leads to a better outcome. If the stock price ends up below $\$ 290$ , the stop-loss order alternative leads to a better outcome because the cost of the option is avoided. If the stock price falls to $\$ 280$ in November and then rises to $\$ 350$ by December, the put option alternative leads to a better outcome. The investor is paying $\$ 2,130$ for the chance to benefit from this second type of outcome.  

# 1.33  

Suppose $S _ { T }$ is the price of oil at the bond's maturity. In addition to $\$ 1,000$ , the Standard Oil bond pays:  

$$
\begin{array} { c c c } { { S _ { T } < \ S 2 5 } } & { { : } } & { { 0 } } \\ { { \ S 4 0 > S _ { T } > \ S 2 5 } } & { { : } } & { { 1 7 0 ( S _ { _ T } - 2 5 ) } } \\ { { S _ { T } > \ S 4 0 } } & { { : } } & { { 2 , 5 5 0 } } \end{array}
$$  

This is the payoff from 170 call options on oil with a strike price of 25 less the payoff from 170 call options on oil with a strike price of 40. The bond is therefore equivalent to a regular bond plus a long position in 170 call options on oil with a strike price of $\$ 25$ plus a short position in 170 call options on oil with a strike price of $\$ 40$ . The investor has what is termed a bull spread on oil. This is discussed in Chapter 12.  

# 1.34  

You sell the treasurer a put option on GBP with a strike price of 1.19 and buy from the treasurer a call option on GBP with a strike price of 1.25. Both options are on one million pounds and have a maturity of six months. This is known as a range forward contract and is discussed in Chapter 17.  

# CHAPTER 2 Futures Markets and Central Counterparties  

# Practice Questions  

# 2.1  

There will be a margin call when $\$ 1,000$ has been lost from the margin account. This will occur when the price of silver increases by $1 , 0 0 0 / 5 , 0 0 0 = \mathbb { S } 0 . 2 0 .$ The price of silver must therefore rise to $\$ 17.40$ per ounce for there to be a margin call. If the margin call is not met, your broker closes out your position.  

# 2.2  

The total profit is $( \ S 5 0 . 5 0 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } \ S 4 8 . 3 0 ) \times 1 , 0 0 0 = \ S 2 , 2 0 0$ . Of this $( \mathbb { S } 4 9 . 1 0 - \mathbb { S } 4 8 . 3 0 ) \times 1 , 0 0 0$ or $\$ 800$ is realized on a day-by-day basis between September 2021 and December 31, 2021. A further $( \mathbb { S } 5 0 . 5 0 - \mathbb { S } 4 9 . 1 0 ) \times 1 , 0 0 0$ or $\$ 1,400$ is realized on a day-by-day basis between January 1, 2022, and March 2022. A hedger would be taxed on the whole profit of $\$ 2,200$ in 2022. A speculator would be taxed on $\$ 800$ in 2021 and $\$ 1,400$ in 2022.  

# 2.3.  

A stop order to sell at $\$ 2$ is an order to sell at the best available price once a price of $\$ 2$ or less is reached. It could be used to limit the losses from an existing long position. A limit order to sell at $\$ 2$ is an order to sell at a price of $\$ 2$ or more. It could be used to instruct a broker that a short position should be taken, providing it can be done at a price at least as favorable as $\$ 2$ .  

# 2.4  

In futures markets, prices are quoted as the number of U.S. dollars per unit of foreign currency. Spot and forward rates are quoted in this way for the British pound, euro, Australian dollar, and New Zealand dollar. For other major currencies, spot and forward rates are quoted as the number of units of foreign currency per U.S. dollar.  

2.5 These options make the contract less attractive to the party with the long position and more attractive to the party with the short position. They therefore tend to reduce the futures price.  

# 2.6  

Margin is money deposited by a trader with his or her broker. It acts as a guarantee that the trader can cover any losses on the futures contract. The balance in the margin account is adjusted daily to reflect gains and losses on the futures contract. If losses lead to the balance in the margin account falling below a certain level, the trader is required to deposit a further margin. This system makes it unlikely that the trader will default. A similar system of margin accounts makes it unlikely that the trader's broker will default on the contract it has with the clearing house member and unlikely that the clearing house member will default with the clearing house.  

# 2.7  

There is a margin call if more than $\$ 1,500$ is lost on one contract. This happens if the futures price of frozen orange juice falls by more than 10 cents to below 150 cents per pound. $\$ 2,000$ can be withdrawn from the margin account if there is a gain on one contract of $\$ 1,000$ . This will happen if the futures price rises by 6.67 cents to 166.67 cents per pound.  

# 2.8  

If the futures price is greater than the spot price during the delivery period, an arbitrageur buys the asset, shorts a futures contract, and makes delivery for an immediate profit. If the futures price is less than the spot price during the delivery period, there is no similar perfect arbitrage strategy. An arbitrageur can take a long futures position but cannot force immediate delivery of the asset. The decision on when delivery will be made is made by the party with the short position. Nevertheless companies interested in acquiring the asset may find it attractive to enter into a long futures contract and wait for delivery to be made.  

# 2.9  

A market-if-touched order is executed at the best available price after a trade occurs at a specified price or at a price more favorable than the specified price. A stop order is executed at the best available price after there is a bid or offer at the specified price or at a price less favorable than the specified price.  

# 2.10  

A stop-limit order to sell at 20.30 with a limit of 20.10 means that as soon as there is a bid at 20.30, the contract should be sold providing this can be done at 20.10 or a higher price.  

# 2.11  

The clearing house member is required to provide $2 0 \times \ S 2 , 0 0 0 = \ S 4 0 , 0 0 0$ as initial margin for the new contracts. There is a gain of $( 5 0 , 2 0 0 \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 5 0 , 0 0 0 ) \times 1 0 0 = \ S 2 0 , 0 0 0$ on the existing contracts. There is also a loss of $( 5 1 , 0 0 0 - 5 0 , 2 0 0 ) { \times } 2 0 = \ S 1 6 , 0 0 0$ on the new contracts. The member must therefore add  

$$
4 0 , 0 0 0 - 2 0 , 0 0 0 + 1 6 , 0 0 0 = \ S 3 6 , 0 0 0
$$  

to the margin account.  

# 2.12  

Regulations require most standard OTC transactions entered into between financial institutions to be cleared by CCPs. These have initial and variation margin requirements similar to exchanges. There is also a requirement that initial and variation margin be provided for most bilaterally cleared OTC transactions between financial institutions.  

As more transactions go through CCPs there will more netting. (Transactions with counterparty A can be netted against transactions with counterparty B provided both are cleared through the same CCP.)   This will tend to offset the increase in collateral somewhat. However, it is expected that on balance there will be collateral increases.  

# 2.13  

The 1.1000 forward quote is the number of Swiss francs per dollar. The 0.9000 futures quote is the number of dollars per Swiss franc. When quoted in the same way as the futures price, the forward price is $\lvert / 1 . 1 0 0 0 = 0 . 9 0 9 1$ . The Swiss franc is therefore more valuable in the forward market than in the futures market. The forward market is therefore more attractive for a trader wanting to sell Swiss francs.  

# 2.14  

Live hog futures are traded by the CME Group. The broker will request some initial margin. The order will be relayed by telephone to your broker's trading desk on the floor of the exchange (or to the trading desk of another broker).  It will then be sent by messenger to a commission broker who will execute the trade according to your instructions. Confirmation of the trade eventually reaches you. If there are adverse movements in the futures price, your broker may contact you to request additional margin.  

# 2.15  

Speculators are important market participants because they add liquidity to the market. However, regulators generally only approve contracts when they are likely to be of interest to hedgers as well as speculators.  

# 2.16  

The contract would not be a success. Parties with short positions would hold their contracts until delivery and then deliver the cheapest form of the asset. This might well be viewed by the party with the long position as garbage! Once news of the quality problem became widely known no one would be prepared to buy the contract. This shows that futures contracts are feasible only when there are rigorous standards within an industry for defining the quality of the asset. Many futures contracts have in practice failed because of the problem of defining quality.  

# 2.17  

If both sides of the transaction are entering into a new contract, the open interest increases by one. If both sides of the transaction are closing out existing positions, the open interest decreases by one. If one party is entering into a new contract while the other party is closing out an existing position, the open interest stays the same.  

# 2.18  

The total profit is  

$$
4 0 , 0 0 0 \times ( 1 . 2 1 2 0 - 1 . 1 8 3 0 ) = \mathbb { S } 1 , 1 6 0
$$  

If the company is a hedger, this is all taxed in 2023. If it is a speculator  

$$
4 0 , 0 0 0 \times ( 1 . 2 1 2 0 - 1 . 1 8 8 0 ) = \ S 9 6 0
$$  

is taxed in 2022 and  

$$
4 0 , 0 0 0 \ \times ( 1 . 1 8 8 0 - 1 . 1 8 3 0 ) = \ S 2 0 0
$$  

is taxed in 2023.  

# 2.19  

The farmer can short 3 contracts that have 3 months to maturity. If the price of cattle falls, the gain on the futures contract will offset the loss on the sale of the cattle. If the price of cattle rises, the gain on the sale of the cattle will be offset by the loss on the futures contract. Using futures contracts to hedge has the advantage that the farmer can greatly reduce the uncertainty about the price that will be received. Its disadvantage is that the farmer no longer gains from favorable movements in cattle prices.  

# 2.20  

The mining company can estimate its production on a month by month basis. It can then short futures contracts to lock in the price received for the gold. For example, if a total of 3,000 ounces are expected to be produced in September 2022 and October 2022, the price received for this production can be hedged by shorting 30 October 2022 contracts.  

# 2.21  

A CCP stands between the two parties in an OTC derivative transaction in much the same way that a clearing house does for exchange-traded contracts. It absorbs the credit risk but requires initial and variation margin from each side.  In addition, CCP members are required to contribute to a default fund. The advantage to the financial system is that there is a lot more collateral (i.e., margin) available and it is therefore much less likely that a default by one major participant in the derivatives market will lead to losses by other market participants. The disadvantage is that CCPs are replacing banks as the too-big-to-fail entities in the financial system.  

# 2.22  

The total profit of each trader in dollars is $0 . 0 3 { \times } 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 = 3 0 , 0 0 0$ . Trader B's profit is realized at the end of the three months. Trader A's profit is realized day-by-day during the three months. Substantial losses are made during the first two months and profits are made during the final month. It is likely that Trader B has done better because Trader A had to finance its losses during the first two months.  

# 2.23  

Open interest is the number of contract outstanding. Many traders close out their positions just before the delivery month is reached.  This is why the open interest declines during the month preceding the delivery month. The open interest went down by 600. We can see this in two ways. First, 1,400 shorts closed out and there were 800 new shorts. Second, 1,200 longs closed out and there were 600 new longs.  

# 2.24  

There is a margin call if $\$ 1,000$ is lost on the contract. This will happen if the price of wheat futures rises by 20 cents from 750 cents to 770 cents per bushel. $\$ 1,500$ can be withdrawn if the futures price falls by 30 cents to 720 cents per bushel.  

# 2.25  

You could go long one June oil contract and short one December contract. In June, you take delivery of the oil borrowing $\$ 50$ per barrel at $4 \%$ to meet cash outflows. The interest accumulated in six months is about $5 0 { \times } 0 . 0 4 { \times } 1 / 2$ or $\$ 1$ per barrel. In December, the oil is sold for $\$ 56$ per barrel which is more than the $\$ 51$ that has to be repaid on the loan. The strategy therefore leads to a profit. Note that this profit is independent of the actual price of oil in June and December. It will be slightly affected by the daily settlement procedures.  

# 2.26  

The long forward contract provides a payoff of $S _ { T } - K$ where $S _ { T }$ is the asset price on the date and $K$ is the delivery price. The put option provides a payoff of max $( K { - } S _ { T } , 0 )$ . If $S _ { T } { > } K$ the sum of the two payoffs is $S _ { T } - K .$ . If $S _ { T } { < } K$ the sum of the two payoffs is 0. The combined payoff is therefore max $( S _ { T } - K , 0 )$ . This is the payoff from a call option. The equivalent position is therefore a call option.  

# 2.27  

The counterparty may stop posting collateral and some time will then elapse before the bank is able to close out the transactions. During that time, the transactions may move in the bank's favor, increasing its exposure. Note that the bank is likely to have hedged the transactions and will incur a loss on the hedge if the transactions move in the bank's favor. For example, if the transactions change in value from $\$ 10$ to $\$ 13$ million after the counterparty stops posting  

collateral, the bank loses $\$ 3$ million on the hedge and will not necessarily realize an offsetting gain on the transactions.  

# CHAPTER 3 Hedging Strategies Using Futures  

# Practice Questions  

# 3.1  

A perfect hedge is one that completely eliminates the hedger's risk. A perfect hedge does not always lead to a better outcome than an imperfect hedge. It just leads to a more certain outcome. Consider a company that hedges its exposure to the price of an asset. Suppose the asset's price movements prove to be favorable to the company. A perfect hedge totally neutralizes the company's gain from these favorable price movements. An imperfect hedge, which only partially neutralizes the gains, might well give a better outcome.  

3.2 A minimum variance hedge leads to no hedging when the coefficient of correlation between the futures price changes and changes in the price of the asset being hedged is zero.  

3.3 The optimal hedge ratio is  

$$
0 . 8 \times \frac { 0 . 6 5 } { 0 . 8 1 } = 0 . 6 4 2
$$  

This means that the size of the futures position should be $6 4 . 2 \%$ of the size of the company's exposure in a three-month hedge.  

3.4 The formula for the number of contracts that should be shorted gives  

$$
1 . 2 \times \frac { 2 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 } { 1 , 0 8 0 \times 2 5 0 } = 8 8 . 9
$$  

Rounding to the nearest whole number, 89 contracts should be shorted. To reduce the beta to 0.6, half of this position, or a short position in 44 contracts, is required.  

# 3.5  

A good rule of thumb is to choose a futures contract that has a delivery month as close as possible to, but later than, the month containing the expiration of the hedge. The contracts that should be used are therefore,  

(a) July (b) September (c) March  

# 3.6  

No. Consider, for example, the use of a forward contract to hedge a known cash inflow in a foreign currency. The forward contract locks in the forward exchange rate—which is in general different from the spot exchange rate.  

# 3.7  

The basis is the amount by which the spot price exceeds the futures price. A short hedger is long the asset and short futures contracts. The value of his or her position therefore improves as the basis increases. Similarly, it worsens as the basis decreases.  

# 3.8  

The simple answer to this question is that the treasurer should:  

1. Estimate the company's future cash flows in Japanese yen and U.S. dollars. 2. Enter into forward and futures contracts to lock in the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar cash flows.  

However, this is not the whole story. As the gold jewelry example in Table 3.1 shows, the company should examine whether the magnitudes of the foreign cash flows depend on the exchange rate. For example, will the company be able to raise the price of its product in U.S. dollars if the yen appreciates? If the company can do so, its foreign exchange exposure may be quite low. The key estimates required are those showing the overall effect on the company's profitability of changes in the exchange rate at various times in the future. Once these estimates have been produced, the company can choose between using futures and options to hedge its risk. The results of the analysis should be presented carefully to other executives. It should be explained that a hedge does not ensure that profits will be higher. It means that profit will be more certain. When futures/forwards are used, both the downside and upside are eliminated. With options, a premium is paid to eliminate only the downside.  

# 3.9  

If the hedge ratio is 0.8, the company takes a long position in 16 December oil futures contracts   
on June 8 when the futures price is $\$ 48.00$ . It closes out its position on November 10. The spot   
price and futures price at this time are $\$ 50.00$ and $\$ 49.10$ . The gain on the futures position is $( 4 9 . 1 0 - 4 8 . 0 0 ) \times 1 6 , 0 0 0 = 1 7 , 6 0 0$   
The effective cost of the oil is therefore $2 0 , 0 0 0 \times 5 0 - 1 7 , 6 0 0 = 9 8 2 , 4 1$ 00   
or $\$ 49.12$ per barrel. (This compares with $\$ 48.90$ per barrel when the company is fully hedged.)  

# 3.10  

The statement is not true. The minimum variance hedge ratio is  

$$
\rho \frac { \sigma _ { s } } { \sigma _ { F } }
$$  

It is 1.0 when $\rho = 0 . 5$ and $\sigma _ { s } = 2 \sigma _ { { \scriptscriptstyle F } }$ . Since $\rho < 1 . 0$ the hedge is clearly not perfect.  

# 3.11  

The statement is true. Suppose for the sake of definiteness that the commodity is being purchased. If the hedge ratio is $h$ , the gain on futures is $h ( F _ { 2 } { - } F _ { 1 } )$ so that the price paid is $S _ { 2 } - h ( F _ { 2 } { - } F _ { 1 } )$ or $h b _ { 2 } + h F _ { 1 } + ( 1 - h ) S _ { 2 }$ .  If there is no basis risk, $b _ { 2 }$ is known. For a given $h$ , there is therefore no uncertainty in the first two terms. For any value of $h$ other than 1, there is uncertainty in the third term. The minimum variance hedge ratio is therefore 1.  

# 3.12  

A company that knows it will purchase a commodity in the future is able to lock in a price close to the futures price. This is likely to be particularly attractive when the futures price is less than the spot price.  

# 3.13  

The optimal hedge ratio is  

$$
0 . 7 \times \frac { 1 . 2 } { 1 . 4 } = 0 . 6
$$  

The beef producer requires a long position in $2 0 0 , 0 0 0 \times 0 . 6 = 1 2 0 , 0 0 0$ lbs of cattle. The beef producer should therefore take a long position in 3 December contracts closing out the position on November 15.  

# 3.14  

If weather creates a significant uncertainty about the volume of corn that will be harvested, the farmer should not enter into short forward contracts to hedge the price risk on the expected production. The reason is as follows. Suppose that the weather is bad and the farmer's production is lower than expected. Other farmers are likely to have been affected similarly. Corn production overall will be low and as a consequence the price of corn will be relatively high. The farmer's problems arising from the bad harvest will be made worse by losses on the short futures position. This problem emphasizes the importance of looking at the big picture when hedging. The farmer is correct to question whether hedging price risk while ignoring other risks is a good strategy.  

# 3.15  

A short position in  

$$
1 . 3 \times \frac { 5 0 , 0 0 0 \times 3 0 } { 5 0 \times 1 , 5 0 0 } = 2 6
$$  

contracts is required. It will be profitable if the stock outperforms the market in the sense that its return is greater than that predicted by the capital asset pricing model.  

3.16   
If the company uses a hedge ratio of 1.5 in Table 3.5, it would at each stage short 150 contracts. The gain from the futures contracts would be  

$$
1 . 5 0 \times 1 . 7 0 = \mathbb { S } 2 . 5 5
$$  

per barrel and the company would be $\$ 0.85$ per barrel better off than with a hedge ratio of 1.  

# 3.17  

It may well be true that there is just as much chance that the price of oil in the future will be above the futures price as it will be below the futures price. This means that the use of a futures contract for speculation would be like betting on whether a coin comes up heads or tails. But it might make sense for the airline to use futures for hedging rather than speculation. The futures contract then has the effect of reducing risks. It can be argued that an airline should not expose its shareholders to risks associated with the future price of oil when there are contracts available to hedge the risks.  

# 3.18  

Goldman Sachs can borrow 1 ounce of gold and sell it for $\$ 1200$ . It invests the $\$ 1,200$ at $5 \%$ so that it becomes $\$ 1,260$ at the end of the year. It must pay the lease rate of $1 . 5 \%$ on $\$ 1,200$ . This is $\$ 18$ and leaves it with $\$ 1,242$ . It follows that if it agrees to buy the gold for less than $\$ 1,242$ in one year it will make a profit.  

# 3.19  

a) $0 . 0 5 + 0 . 2 \times ( 0 . 1 2 - 0 . 0 5 ) = 0 . 0 6 4$ or $6 . 4 \%$ b) $0 . 0 5 + 0 . 5 \times ( 0 . 1 2 - 0 . 0 5 ) = 0 . 0 8 5$ or $8 . 5 \%$ c) $0 . 0 5 + 1 . 4 \times ( 0 . 1 2 - 0 . 0 5 ) = 0 . 1 4 8$ or $14 . 8 \%$  

# 3.20  

It should short five contracts. It has basis risk. It is exposed to the difference between the October futures price and the spot price of light sweet crude at the time it closes out its position in September. It is also possibly exposed to the difference between the spot price of light sweet crude and the spot price of the type of oil it is selling.  

# 3.21  

The excess of the spot over the futures at the time the hedge is closed out is $\$ 0.20$ per ounce. If the trader is hedging the purchase of silver, the price paid is the futures price plus the basis. The trader therefore loses $6 0 \times 5 , 0 0 0 \times \ S 0 . 2 0 = \ S 6 0 , 0 0 0$ . If the trader is hedging the sales of silver, the price received is the futures price plus the basis. The trader therefore gains $\$ 60,000$ .  

# 3.22  

(a) The minimum variance hedge ratio, $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { h } } ^ { * }$ , is $0 . 9 5 { \times } 0 . 4 3 / 0 . 4 0 { = } 1 . 0 2 1 2 5 .$   
(b) The hedger should take a short position.   
(c) The optimal number of contracts ignoring daily settlement is $1 . 0 2 1 2 5 \times 5 5 , 0 0 0 / 5 , 0 0 0 = 1 1 . 2 3$ (or 11 when rounded to the nearest whole number)   
(d) The optimal number of contracts is $\hat { \rho } \hat { \sigma } _ { s } V _ { A } / ( \hat { \sigma } _ { F } V _ { F } )$ where $\hat { \rho }$ is correlation between percentage one-day returns of spot and futures, $\hat { \sigma } _ { s }$ and $\hat { \sigma } _ { F }$ are the standard deviations of percentage one-day returns on spot and futures, $V _ { A }$ is the value of the position and $V _ { F }$ is the futures price times the size of one contract. In this case, $V _ { A } = 5 5 , 0 0 0 { \times } 2 8 = 1 , 5 4 0 , 0 0 0$  

and $V _ { F } { = } 5 , 0 0 0 { \times } 2 7 { = } 1 3 5 , 0 0 0$ . If we assume that $ \hat { \rho } { = } 0 . 9 5$ and $\hat { \sigma } _ { s } / \hat { \sigma } _ { F } = 0 . 4 3 / 0 . 4 0 = 1 . 0 7 5$ , the optimal number of contracts when daily settlement is considered $0 . 9 5 { \times } 1 . 0 7 5 { \times } 1 , 5 4 0 , 0 0 0 / 1 3 5 , 0 0 0 { = } 1 1 . 6 5$ (or 12 when rounded to the nearest whole number). This does not make the interest rate adjustment discussed in the final part of Section 3.4.  

# 3.23  

Equation (3.1) shows that the hedge ratio should be $0 . 6 \times 1 . 5 = 0 . 9$ . Define $\boldsymbol { Q }$ as the number of gallons of the new fuel that the company is exposed to. $_ { 0 0 1 Q = 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 : }$ so that $\boldsymbol { \mathcal { Q } }$ is 100 million. It should therefore take a position of 90 million gallons in gasoline futures. Each futures contract is on 42,000 gallons. The number of contracts required is therefore  

$$
\frac { 9 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 } { 4 2 , 0 0 0 } = 2 1 4 2 . 9
$$  

or, rounding to the nearest whole number, 2143.  

# 3.24  

When the expected return on the market is $- 3 0 \%$ , the expected return on a portfolio with a beta of 0.2 is  

$$
0 . 0 5 + 0 . 2 \times ( - 0 . 3 0 - 0 . 0 5 ) = - 0 . 0 2
$$  

or $- 2 \%$ . The actual return of $- 1 0 \%$ is worse than the expected return. The portfolio manager hasdone $8 \%$ worse than a simple strategy of forming a portfolio that is $20 \%$ invested in an equity index and $80 \%$ invested in risk-free investments. (The manager has achieved an alpha of $- 8 \% !$ )  

# 3.25  

a) The company should short  

or 140 contracts.  

b) The company should take a long position in  

or 60 contracts.  

# CHAPTER 4 Interest Rates  

# Practice Questions  

4.1 The rate with continuous compounding is  

$$
4 \ln \left( 1 + { \frac { 0 . 0 7 } { 4 } } \right) = 0 . 0 6 9 4
$$  

or $6 . 9 4 \%$ per annum.  

(a) The rate with annual compounding is  

$$
\left( 1 + \frac { 0 . 0 7 } { 4 } \right) ^ { 4 } - 1 = 0 . 0 7 1 9
$$  

or $7 . 1 9 \%$ per annum.  

# 4.2  

Suppose the bond has a face value of $\$ 100$ . Its price is obtained by discounting the cash flows at $5 . 2 \%$ . The price is  

$$
\frac { 2 } { 1 . 0 2 6 } + \frac { 2 } { 1 . 0 2 6 ^ { 2 } } + \frac { 1 0 2 } { 1 . 0 2 6 ^ { 3 } } = 9 8 . 2 9
$$  

If the 18-month zero rate is $R$ , we must have  

$$
\frac { 2 } { 1 . 0 2 5 } + \frac { 2 } { 1 . 0 2 5 ^ { 2 } } + \frac { 1 0 2 } { \left( 1 + R / 2 \right) ^ { 3 } } = 9 8 . 2 9
$$  

which  gives $R { = } 5 . 2 0 4 \%$ .  

4.3  

(a) With annual compounding, the return is  

$$
\frac { 1 1 0 0 } { 1 0 0 0 } - 1 = 0 . 1
$$  

or $10 \%$ per annum.  

(b) With semi-annual compounding, the return is $R$ where  

$$
1 0 0 0 { \bigg ( } 1 + { \frac { R } { 2 } } { \bigg ) } ^ { 2 } = 1 1 0 0
$$  

i.e.,  

$$
1 + { \frac { R } { 2 } } = { \sqrt { 1 . 1 } } = 1 . 0 4 8 8
$$  

so that $R = 0 . 0 9 7 6$ . The percentage return is therefore $9 . 7 6 \%$ per annum.  

(c) With monthly compounding, the return is $R$ where  

$$
1 0 0 0 { \bigg ( } 1 + { \frac { R } { 1 2 } } { \bigg ) } ^ { 1 2 } = 1 1 0 0
$$  

i.e.  

$$
\left( 1 + { \frac { R } { 1 2 } } \right) = { \sqrt [ { 1 2 } ] { 1 } } . 1 = 1 . 0 0 7 9 7
$$  

so that $R = 0 . 0 9 5 7$ . The percentage return is therefore $9 . 5 7 \%$ per annum.  

(d) With continuous compounding, the return is $R$ where: $1 0 0 0 e ^ { R } = 1 1 0 0$ i.e., $e ^ { R } = 1 . 1$ so that $R = \ln 1 . 1 = 0 . 0 9 5 3$ . The percentage return is therefore $9 . 5 3 \%$ per annum.  

4.4 The forward rates with continuous compounding are as follows,  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Qtr 2</td><td>3.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Qtr 3</td><td>3.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Qtr 4</td><td>3.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Qtr 5</td><td>4.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Qtr 6</td><td>4.2%</td></tr></table></body></html>

The value of the FRA is

When the term structure is upward sloping, $c > a > b$ . When it is downward sloping, $b > a > c$ .  

# 4.7  

Duration provides information about the effect of a small parallel shift in the yield curve on the value of a bond portfolio. The percentage decrease in the value of the portfolio equals the duration of the portfolio multiplied by the amount by which interest rates are increased in the small parallel shift. The duration measure has the following limitation. It applies only to parallel shifts in the yield curve that are small.  

# 4.8  

The rate of interest is $R$ where:  

$$
e ^ { R } = \left( 1 + \frac { 0 . 0 8 } { 1 2 } \right) ^ { 1 2 }
$$  

i.e.,  

$$
R = 1 2 \ln \left( 1 + { \frac { 0 . 0 8 } { 1 2 } } \right)
$$  

$$
= 0 . 0 7 9 7
$$  

The rate of interest is therefore $7 . 9 7 \%$ per annum.  

4.9 The equivalent rate of interest with quarterly compounding is $R$ where  

$$
e ^ { 0 . 0 4 } = \left( 1 + { \frac { R } { 4 } } \right) ^ { 4 }
$$  

or  

$$
R = 4 ( e ^ { 0 . 0 1 } - 1 ) = 0 . 0 4 0 2
$$  

The amount of interest paid each quarter is therefore:  

$$
1 0 , 0 0 0 \times { \frac { 0 . 0 4 0 2 } { 4 } } = 1 0 0 . 5 0
$$  

or $\$ 100.50$ .  

4.10 The bond pays $\$ 2$ in 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and $\$ 102$ in 30 months. The cash price is $2 e ^ { - 0 . 0 4 \times 0 . 5 } + 2 e ^ { - 0 . 0 4 2 \times 1 . 0 } + 2 e ^ { - 0 . 0 4 4 \times 1 . 5 } + 2 e ^ { - 0 . 0 4 6 \times 2 } + 1 0 2 e ^ { - 0 . 0 4 8 \times 2 . 5 } = 9 8 . 0 4$  

# 4.11  

The bond pays $\$ 4$ in 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months, and $\$ 104$ in 36 months. The bond yield is the value of $y$ that solves  

$$
4 e ^ { - 0 . 5 y } + 4 e ^ { - 1 . 0 y } + 4 e ^ { - 1 . 5 y } + 4 e ^ { - 2 . 0 y } + 4 e ^ { - 2 . 5 y } + 1 0 4 e ^ { - 3 . 0 y } = 1 0 4
$$  

Using the Solver or Goal Seek tool in Excel, $y = 0 . 0 6 4 0 7$ or $6 . 4 0 7 \%$ .  

# 4.12  

Using the notation in the text, $m = 2$ , $d = e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 \times 2 } = 0 . 8 6 9 4$ . Also $A = e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } + e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 \times 1 . 0 } + e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 5 \times 1 . 5 } + e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 \times 2 . 0 } = 3 . 6 9 3 5$  

The formula in the text gives the par yield as  

$$
\frac { ( 1 0 0 - 1 0 0 \times 0 . 8 6 9 4 ) \times 2 } { 3 . 6 9 3 5 } = 7 . 0 7 4 1
$$  

To verify that this is correct, we calculate the value of a bond that pays a coupon of $7 . 0 7 4 1 \%$ per year (that is 3.5370 every six months). The value is  

$$
3 . 5 3 7 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } + 3 . 5 3 7 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 \times 1 . 0 } + 3 . 5 3 7 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 5 \times 1 . 5 } + 1 0 3 . 5 3 7 e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 \times 2 . 0 } = 1 0 0 \
$$  

verifying that $7 . 0 7 4 1 \%$ is the par yield.  

4.13   
The forward rates with continuous compounding are as follows:   
Year 2: $4 . 0 \%$   
Year 3: $5 . 1 \%$   
Year 4: $5 . 7 \%$   
Year 5: $5 . 7 \%$  

# 4.14  

Taking a long position in two of the $4 \%$ coupon bonds and a short position in one of the $8 \%$ coupon bonds leads to the following cash flows  

$$
\yen 80
$$  

$$
\mathrm { Y e a r } 1 0 : 2 0 0 - 1 0 0 = 1 0 0
$$  

because the coupons cancel out. $\$ 100$ in 10 years time is equivalent to $\$ 70$ today. The 10year rate, $R$ , (continuously compounded) is therefore given by  

$$
1 0 0 = 7 0 e ^ { 1 0 R }
$$  

The rate is  

$$
\frac { 1 } { 1 0 } \ln \frac { 1 0 0 } { 7 0 } = 0 . 0 3 5 7
$$  

or $3 . 5 7 \%$ per annum.  

# 4.15  

If long-term rates were simply a reflection of expected future short-term rates, we would expect the term structure to be downward sloping as often as it is upward sloping. (This is based on the assumption that half of the time investors expect rates to increase and half of the time investors expect rates to decrease). Liquidity preference theory argues that long term rates are high relative to expected future short-term rates. This means that the term structure should be upward sloping more often than it is downward sloping.  

# 4.16  

The par yield is the yield on a coupon-bearing bond. The zero rate is the yield on a zerocoupon bond. When the yield curve is upward sloping, the yield on an $N .$ -year coupon-bearing bond is less than the yield on an $N .$ -year zero-coupon bond. This is because the coupons are discounted at a lower rate than the $N .$ -year rate and drag the yield down below this rate. Similarly, when the yield curve is downward sloping, the yield on an $N .$ -year coupon bearing bond is higher than the yield on an $N .$ -year zero-coupon bond.  

# 4.17  

A repo is a contract where an investment dealer who owns securities agrees to sell them to another company now and buy them back later at a slightly higher price. The other company is providing a loan to the investment dealer. This loan involves very little credit risk. If the borrower does not honor the agreement, the lending company simply keeps the securities. If the lending company does not keep to its side of the agreement, the original owner of the securities keeps the cash.  

# 4.18  

a) The bond's price is $8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 } + 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 \times 2 } + 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 \times 3 } + 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 \times 4 } + 1 0 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 \times 5 } = 1 0 3 . 0 5$  

b) The bond's duration is  

$$
\frac { 1 } { 1 0 3 . 0 5 } \Big [ 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 } + 2 \times 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 \times 2 } + 3 \times 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 \times 3 } + 4 \times 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 \times 4 } + 5 \times 1 0 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 \times 5 } \Big ]
$$  

c) Since, with the notation in the chapter $\Delta B = - B D \Delta y$ the effect on the bond's price of a $0 . 2 \%$ decrease in its yield is $1 0 3 . 0 5 \times 4 . 3 2 3 5 \times 0 . 0 0 2 = 0 . 8 9$ The bond's price should increase from 103.05 to 103.94.   
d) With a $6 . 8 \%$ yield the bond's price is $8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 8 } + 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 8 \times 2 } + 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 8 \times 3 } + 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 8 \times 4 } + 1 0 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 8 \times 5 } = 1 0 3 . 9 5$ This is close to the answer in (c).  

# 4.19  

The 6-month Treasury bill provides a return of $6 / 9 4 = 6 . 3 8 3 \%$ in six months. This is $2 \times 6 . 3 8 3 = 1 2 . 7 6 6 \%$ per annum with semiannual compounding or $2 \ln ( 1 . 0 6 3 8 3 ) = 1 2 . 3 8 \%$ per annum with continuous compounding. The 12-month rate is $1 1 / 8 9 = 1 2 . 3 6 0 \%$ with annual compounding or $\ln ( 1 . 1 2 3 6 ) = 1 1 . 6 5 \%$ with continuous compounding.  

For the $1 \textstyle { \frac { 1 } { 2 } }$ year bond, we must have  

$$
4 e ^ { - 0 . 1 2 3 8 \times 0 . 5 } + 4 e ^ { - 0 . 1 1 6 5 \times 1 } + 1 0 4 e ^ { - 1 . 5 R } = 9 4 . 8 4
$$  

where $R$ is the $1 \textstyle { \frac { 1 } { 2 } }$ year zero rate. It follows that  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { 3 . 7 6 + 3 . 5 6 + 1 0 4 e ^ { - 1 . 5 R } = 9 4 . 8 4 } } \\ { { e ^ { - 1 . 5 R } = 0 . 8 4 1 5 } } \\ { { R = 0 . 1 1 5 } } \end{array}
$$  

or $1 1 . 5 \%$ . For the 2-year bond, we must have  

$$
5 e ^ { - 0 . 1 2 3 8 \times 0 . 5 } + 5 e ^ { - 0 . 1 1 6 5 \times 1 } + 5 e ^ { - 0 . 1 1 5 \times 1 . 5 } + 1 0 5 e ^ { - 2 R } = 9 7 . 1 2
$$  

where $R$ is the 2-year zero rate. It follows that  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { e ^ { - 2 R } = 0 . 7 9 7 7 } } \\ { { R = 0 . 1 1 3 } } \end{array}
$$  

or $1 1 . 3 \%$ .  

# 4.20  

The first exchange of payments is known. Each subsequent exchange of payments is an FRA where interest at $5 \%$ is exchanged for interest at LIBOR on a principal of $\$ 100$ million. Interest rate swaps are discussed further in Chapter 7.  

# 4.21  

We must solve $1 . 1 1 = ( 1 + R / n ) ^ { n }$ where $R$ is the required rate and the number of times per year the rate is compounded. The answers are: a) $10 . 7 1 \%$ , b) $10 . 5 7 \%$ , c) $1 0 . 4 8 \%$ , d) $1 0 . 4 5 \%$ , e) $1 0 . 4 4 \%$  

# 4.22  

The bond's theoretical price is   
$2 0 \times e ^ { - 0 . 0 2 \times 0 . 5 } + 2 0 \times e ^ { - 0 . 0 2 3 \times 1 } + 2 0 \times e ^ { - 0 . 0 2 7 \times 1 . 5 } + 1 0 2 0 \times e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 2 \times 2 } = 1 0 1 5 . 3 2$   
The bond's yield assuming that it sells for its theoretical price is obtained by solving $2 0 \times e ^ { - y \times 0 . 5 } + 2 0 \times e ^ { - y \times 1 } + 2 0 \times e ^ { - y \times 1 . 5 } + 1 0 2 0 \times e ^ { - y \times 2 } = 1 0 1 5 . 3 2$   
It is $3 . 1 8 \%$ .  

# 4.23 (Excel file)  

The answer (with continuous compounding) is $4 . 0 7 \%$ .  

# 4.24  

$2 . 5 \%$ is paid every six months.  

a) With annual compounding, the rate is $1 . 0 2 5 ^ { 2 } - 1 = 0 . 0 5 0 6 2 5$ or $5 . 0 6 2 5 \%$ b) With monthly compounding, the rate is $1 2 \times ( 1 . 0 2 5 ^ { 1 / 6 } - 1 ) = 0 . 0 4 9 4 9$ or $4 . 9 4 9 \%$ . c) With continuous compounding, the rate is $2 \times \ln 1 . 0 2 5 = 0 . 0 4 9 3 9$ or $4 . 9 3 9 \%$ .  

# 4.25  

The duration of Portfolio A is  

$$
\frac { 1 \times 2 0 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 1 } + 1 0 \times 6 0 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 1 0 } } { 2 0 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 1 } + 6 0 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 1 0 } } = 5 . 9 5
$$  

Since this is also the duration of Portfolio B, the two portfolios do have the same duration.  

a) The value of Portfolio A is $2 0 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 } + 6 0 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 1 0 } = 4 0 1 6 . 9 5$ When yields increase by 10 basis points, its value becomes $2 0 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 0 1 } + 6 0 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 0 1 \times 1 0 } = 3 9 9 3 . 1 8$ The percentage decrease in value is  

$$
\frac { 2 3 . 7 7 \times 1 0 0 } { 4 0 1 6 . 9 5 } = 0 . 5 9 \%
$$  

The value of Portfolio B is  

$$
5 0 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 5 . 9 5 } = 2 7 5 7 . 8 1
$$  

When yields increase by 10 basis points, its value becomes $5 0 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 0 1 \times 5 . 9 5 } = 2 7 4 1 . 4 5$  

The percentage decrease in value is  

$$
\frac { 1 6 . 3 6 \times 1 0 0 } { 2 7 5 7 . 8 1 } = 0 . 5 9 \%
$$  

The percentage changes in the values of the two portfolios for a 10 basis point increase in yields are therefore the same.  

b) When yields increase by $5 \%$ , the value of Portfolio A becomes $2 0 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 5 } + 6 0 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 5 \times 1 0 } = 3 0 6 0 . 2 0$ and the value of Portfolio B becomes $5 0 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 5 \times 5 . 9 5 } = 2 0 4 8 . 1 5$ The percentage reductions in the values of the two portfolios are: Portfolio A  $\frac { 9 5 6 . 7 5 } { 4 0 1 6 . 9 5 } { \times 1 0 0 } = 2 3 . 8 2$ Portfolio B  $\frac { 7 0 9 . 6 6 } { 2 7 5 7 . 8 1 } { \times 1 0 0 } = 2 5 . 7 3$ Since the percentage decline in value of Portfolio A is less than that of Portfolio B, Portfolio A has a greater convexity.  

# 4.26  

In the Bond Price worksheet, we input a principal of 100, a life of 2 years, a coupon rate of $6 \%$ and semiannual settlement. The yield curve data from Table 4.2 is also input. The bond price is 98.38506. The DV01 is −0.018819. When the term structure rates are increased to 5.01, 5.81, 6.41, and 6.81, the bond price decreases to 98.36625. This is a reduction of 0.01881 which corresponds to the DV01. (The DV01 is actually calculated in DerivaGem by averaging the impact of a one-basis-point increase and a one-basis-point decrease.). The bond duration satisfies  

$$
\frac { \Delta B } { B } = - D \Delta y
$$  

In this case, $\Delta B = - 0 . 0 1 8 8 2$ , $B = 9 8 . 3 8 5 0 6$ , and $\Delta y = 0 . 0 0 0 1$ so that the duration is $1 0 , 0 0 0 \times 0 . 0 1 8 8 2 / 9 8 . 3 8 5 0 6 = 1 . 9 1$ years.  

The impact of increasing all rates by $2 \%$ is to reduce the bond price by 3.691 to 94.694. The effect on price predicted by the DV01 is $2 0 0 \times - 0 . 0 1 8 8 1$ or $- 3 . 7 6 3 8$ . The gamma is 0.036931 per $\%$ per $\%$ .  In this case, the change is $2 \%$ . From equation (4.18), the convexity correction gamma is therefore  

$$
0 . 5 \times 0 . 0 3 6 9 3 1 \times 2 ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 7 3 9
$$  

The price change estimated using DV01 and gamma is therefore $- 3 . 7 6 3 8 + 0 . 0 7 3 9 = 3 . 6 9 0$ which is very close to the actual change.  

The gamma  is 0.036931 per $\%$ per $\%$ . Because $1 \%$ is 0.01, gamma is $1 0 , 0 0 0 \times 0 . 0 3 6 9 3 1$ .   
The convexity is gamma divided the bond price.  This is $1 0 , 0 0 0 \times 0 . 0 3 6 9 3 1 / 9 8 . 3 8 5 0 6 = 3 . 7 5$ .  

# CHAPTER 5 Determination of Forward and Futures Prices  

# Practice Questions  

# 5.1  

The forward price of an asset today is the price at which you would agree to buy or sell the asset at a future time. The value of a forward contract is zero when you first enter into it. As time passes, the underlying asset price changes and the value of the contract may become positive or negative.  

5.2 The forward price is $3 0 e ^ { 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } = 3 0 . 7 6$ .  

5.3 The futures price is $3 5 0 e ^ { ( 0 . 0 4 - 0 . 0 3 ) \times 0 . 3 3 3 3 } = 3 5 1 . 1 7 .$  

# 5.4  

Gold is an investment asset. If the futures price is too high, investors will find it profitable to increase their holdings of gold and short futures contracts. If the futures price is too low, they will find it profitable to decrease their holdings of gold and go long in the futures market. Copper is a consumption asset. If the futures price is too high, a strategy of buy copper and short futures works. However, because investors do not in general hold the asset, the strategy of sell copper and buy futures is not available to them. There is therefore an upper bound, but no lower bound, to the futures price.  

# 5.5  

A foreign currency provides a known interest rate, but the interest is received in the foreign currency. The value in the domestic currency of the income provided by the foreign currency is therefore known as a percentage of the value of the foreign currency. This means that the income has the properties of a known yield.  

# 56  

The futures price of a stock index is always less than the expected future value of the index. This follows from Section 5.14 and the fact that the index has positive systematic risk. For an alternative argument, let $\mu$ be the expected return required by investors on the index so that $E ( S _ { T } ) = S _ { 0 } e ^ { ( \mu - q ) T }$ . Because $\mu > r$ and $F _ { 0 } = S _ { 0 } e ^ { ( r - q ) T }$ , it follows that $E ( S _ { T } ) > F _ { 0 }$ .  

# 5.7  

a) The forward price, $F _ { 0 }$ , is given by equation (5.1) as: $F _ { 0 } = 4 0 \mathrm { e } ^ { 0 . 0 5 \times 1 } = 4 2 . 0 5$ or $\$ 42.05$ . The initial value of the forward contract is zero.   
b) The delivery price $K$ in the contract is $\$ 42.05$ . The value of the contract, $f$ , after six months is given by equation (5.5) as:  

$$
f = 4 5  – 4 2 . 0 5 \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } = 3 . 9 9
$$  

i.e., it is $\$ 3.99$ . The forward price is:  

$$
4 5 \mathrm { e } ^ { 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } = 4 6 . 1 4
$$  

or $\$ 46.14$ .  

5.8   
Using equation (5.3), the six month futures price is $1 5 0 e ^ { ( 0 . 0 7 - 0 . 0 3 2 ) \times 0 . 5 } = 1 5 2 . 8 8$   
or $\$ 152.88$ .  

5.9 The futures contract lasts for five months. The dividend yield is $2 \%$ for three of the months and $5 \%$ for two of the months. The average dividend yield is therefore  

$$
\frac { 1 } { 5 } ( 3 \times 2 + 2 \times 5 ) = 3 . 2 \%
$$  

The futures price is therefore  

$$
1 3 0 0 \mathrm { e } ^ { ( 0 . 0 4 - 0 . 0 3 2 ) \times 0 . 4 1 6 7 } = 1 3 0 4 . 3 4
$$  

or $\$ 1304.34$  

# 5.10 The theoretical futures price is  

$$
4 0 0 \mathrm { e } ^ { ( 0 . 0 6 - 0 . 0 4 ) \times 4 / 1 2 } = 4 0 2 . 6 8
$$  

The actual futures price is 405. This shows that the index futures price is too high relative to the index. The correct arbitrage strategy is the following:  

1. Sell futures contracts.   
2. Buy the shares underlying the index.  

5.11   
The settlement prices for the futures contracts are to   
Jun:     0.93070   
Sept: 0.93200   
The September price is $0 . 1 4 \%$ above the June price. This suggests that the short-term interest rate in Japan was less than the short-term interest rate in the U.S. by about $0 . 1 4 \%$ per three months or about $0 . 5 6 \%$ per year.   
5.12   
The theoretical futures price is $1 . 0 5 0 0 e ^ { ( 0 . 0 2 - 0 . 0 1 ) \times 2 / 1 2 } { = } 1 . 0 5 1 8$   
The actual futures price is too low. This suggests that a Swiss arbitrageur should sell Swiss   
francs for US dollars and buy Swiss francs back in the futures market.  

5.13 The present value of the storage costs for nine months are $\overline { { 0 . 0 6 + 0 . 0 6 \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 2 5 } + 0 . 0 6 \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } = 0 . 1 7 8 } }$ or $\$ 0.178$ . The futures price is from equation (5.11) given by $F _ { 0 }$ where  

$F _ { 0 } = ( 2 5 . 0 0 0 + 0 . 1 7 8 ) e ^ { 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 7 5 } = 2 6 . 1 4$ i.e., it is $\$ 26.14$ per ounce.  

# 5.14  

If  

$$
F _ { 2 } > F _ { 1 } e ^ { r ( t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 } ) }
$$  

an investor could make a riskless profit by:  

1. Taking a long position in a futures contract which matures at time $t _ { 1 }$ .   
2. Taking a short position in a futures contract which matures at time $t _ { 2 }$ .  

When the first futures contract matures, the asset is purchased for $F _ { 1 }$ using funds borrowed at rate $r$ . It is then held until time $t _ { 2 }$ at which point it is exchanged for $F _ { 2 }$ under the second contract. The costs of the funds borrowed and accumulated interest at time $t _ { 2 }$ is $F _ { 1 } e ^ { r ( t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 } ) }$ . A positive profit of  

$$
F _ { 2 } - F _ { 1 } e ^ { r ( t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 } ) }
$$  

is then realized at time $t _ { 2 }$ . This type of arbitrage opportunity cannot exist for long. Hence:  

$$
F _ { 2 } \leq F _ { 1 } e ^ { r ( t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 } ) }
$$  

# 5.15  

In total, the gain or loss under a futures contract is equal to the gain or loss under the corresponding forward contract. However, the timing of the cash flows is different. When the time value of money is taken into account, a futures contract may prove to be more valuable or less valuable than a forward contract. Of course, the company does not know in advance which will work out better. The long forward contract provides a perfect hedge. The long futures contract provides a slightly imperfect hedge.  

a) In this case, the forward contract would lead to a slightly better outcome. The company will make a loss on its hedge. If the hedge is with a forward contract, the whole of the loss will be realized at the end. If it is with a futures contract, the loss will be realized day by day throughout the contract. On a present value basis the former is preferable.   
b) In this case, the futures contract would lead to a slightly better outcome. The company will make a gain on the hedge. If the hedge is with a forward contract, the gain will be realized at the end. If it is with a futures contract, the gain will be realized day by day throughout the life of the contract. On a present value basis, the latter is preferable.   
c) In this case, the futures contract would lead to a slightly better outcome. This is because it would involve positive cash flows early and negative cash flows later.   
d) In this case, the forward contract would lead to a slightly better outcome. This is because, in the case of the futures contract, the early cash flows would be negative and the later cash flow would be positive.  

# 5.16  

From the discussion in Section 5.14 of the text, the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future exchange rate when the exchange rate has no systematic risk. To have no systematic risk, the exchange rate must be uncorrelated with the return on the market.  

# 5.17  

Suppose that $F _ { 0 }$ is the futures price at time zero for a contract maturing at time $T$ and $F _ { 1 }$ is the futures price for the same contract at time $t _ { 1 }$ . It follows that  

$$
F _ { 0 } = S _ { 0 } e ^ { ( r - q ) T }
$$  

$$
F _ { 1 } = S _ { 1 } e ^ { ( r - q ) ( T - t _ { 1 } ) }
$$  

where $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } }$ and $S _ { 1 }$ are the spot price at times zero and $t _ { 1 } , r$ is the risk-free rate, and $q$ is the dividend yield. These equations imply that  

$$
\frac { F _ { _ 1 } } { F _ { _ 0 } } { = } \frac { S _ { _ 1 } } { S _ { _ 0 } } e ^ { - ( r - q ) t _ { 1 } }
$$  

Define the excess return of the portfolio underlying the index over the risk-free rate as $x$ . The total return is $r + x$ and the return realized in the form of capital gains is $r + x - q$ . It follows that $\begin{array} { r } { S _ { 1 } = S _ { 0 } e ^ { ( r + x - q ) t _ { 1 } } } \end{array}$ and the equation for $F _ { 1 } / F _ { 0 }$ reduces to  

$$
\frac { F _ { _ 1 } } { F _ { _ 0 } } { = } e ^ { x t _ { 1 } }
$$  

which is the required result.

To understand the meaning of the expected future price of a commodity, suppose that there are $N$ different possible prices at a particular future time: $P _ { 1 } , P _ { 2 } , … , P _ { { } _ { N } } .$ . Define $q _ { i }$ as the (subjective) probability the price being $P _ { i }$ (with $q _ { 1 } + q _ { 2 } + … + q _ { N } = 1 .$ ). The expected future price is  

$$
\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } q _ { i } P _ { i }
$$  

Different people may have different expected future prices for the commodity. The expected future price in the market can be thought of as an average of the opinions of different market participants. Of course, in practice the actual price of the commodity at the future time may prove to be higher or lower than the expected price.  

Keynes and Hicks argue that speculators on average make money from commodity futures trading and hedgers on average lose money from commodity futures trading. If speculators tend to have short positions in crude oil futures, the Keynes and Hicks argument implies that futures prices overstate expected future spot prices. If crude oil futures prices decline at $2 \%$ per year, the Keynes and Hicks argument therefore implies an even faster decline for the expected price of crude oil in this case.  

# 5.19  

When the geometric average of the price relatives is used, the changes in the value of the index do not correspond to changes in the value of a portfolio that is traded. Equation (5.8) is therefore no longer correct. The changes in the value of the portfolio are monitored by an index calculated from the arithmetic average of the prices of the stocks in the portfolio. Since the geometric average of a set of numbers is always less than the arithmetic average, equation (5.8) overstates the futures price. It is rumored that at one time (prior to 1988), equation (5.8) did hold for the Value Line Index. A major Wall Street firm was the first to recognize that this represented a trading opportunity. It made a financial killing by buying the stocks underlying the index and shorting the futures.  

# 5.20  

(a) The relationship between the futures price $F _ { t }$ and the spot price $S _ { t }$ at time $t$ is  

$$
F _ { t } = S _ { t } e ^ { ( r - r _ { f } ) ( T - t ) }
$$  

Suppose that the hedge ratio is $h$ . The price obtained with hedging is  

$$
h ( F _ { 0 } - F _ { t } ) + S _ { t }
$$  

where $F _ { 0 }$ is the initial futures price. This is  

$$
h F _ { 0 } + S _ { t } - h S _ { t } e ^ { ( r - r _ { f } ) ( T - t ) }
$$  

If $h = e ^ { ( r _ { f } - r ) ( T - t ) }$ , this reduces to $h F _ { 0 }$ and a zero variance hedge is obtained. (b) When $t$ is one day, $h$ is approximately $e ^ { ( r _ { f } - r ) T } = S _ { 0 } / F _ { 0 }$ . The appropriate hedge ratio is therefore $S _ { 0 } / F _ { 0 }$ .  

(c) When a futures contract is used for hedging, the price movements in each day should in theory be hedged separately. This is because the daily settlement means that a futures contract is closed out and rewritten at the end of each day. From (b) the correct hedge ratio at any given time is, therefore, $S / F$ where $S$ is the spot price and $F$ is the futures price. Suppose there is an exposure to $N$ units of the foreign currency and $M$ units of the foreign currency underlie one futures contract. With a hedge ratio of 1, we should trade $N / M$ contracts. With a hedge ratio of $S / F$ , we should trade  

$$
\frac { S N } { F M }
$$  

contracts. In other words, we should calculate the number of contracts that should be traded as the dollar value of our exposure divided by the dollar value of one futures contract. (This is not the same as the dollar value of our exposure divided by the dollar value of the assets underlying one futures contract.) Since a futures contract is settled daily, we should in theory rebalance our hedge daily so that the outstanding number of futures contracts is always $( S N ) / ( F M )$ . This is known as tailing the hedge. (See Chapter 3.)  

# 5.21  

a) The risk-free rate, b) the excess of the risk-free rate over the dividend yield, c)  the riskfree rate plus the storage cost, d) the excess of the domestic risk-free rate over the foreign risk-free rate.  

# 5.22  

The theoretical forward exchange rate is $1 . 0 4 0 4 \mathrm { e } ^ { ( 0 . 0 0 2 5 - 0 ) \times 0 . 2 5 } = 1 . 0 4 1$  

If the actual forward exchange rate is 1.03, an arbitrageur can a) borrow $X$ Swiss francs, b) convert the Swiss francs to $1 . 0 4 0 4 X$ dollars and invest the dollars for three months at $0 . 2 5 \%$ , and c) buy $X$ Swiss francs at 1.03 in the three-month forward market. In three months, the arbitrageur has $1 . 0 4 0 4 X \mathrm { e } ^ { 0 . 0 0 2 5 \times 0 . 2 5 } = 1 . 0 4 1 X$ dollars. A total of $1 . 3 X$ dollars are used to buy the Swiss francs under the terms of the forward contract and a gain of $0 . 0 1 1 X$ is made. If the actual forward exchange rate is 1.05, an arbitrageur can a) borrow $X$ dollars, b) convert the dollars to $X / 1 . 0 4 0 4$ Swiss francs and invest the Swiss francs for three months at zero interest rate, and c) enter into a forward contract to sell $X / 1 . 0 4 0 4$ Swiss francs in three months. In three months, the arbitrageur has $X / 1 . 0 4 0 4$ Swiss francs. The forward contract converts these to $( 1 . 0 5 X ) / 1 . 0 4 0 4 { = } 1 . 0 0 9 2 X$ dollars. A total of $X \mathrm { e } ^ { 0 . 0 0 2 5 \times 0 . 2 5 } = 1 . 0 0 0 6 X$ is needed to repay the dollar loan. A profit of $0 . 0 0 8 6 X$ dollars is therefore made.  

# 5.23  

The futures price for the three-month contract is $1 2 0 0 e ^ { ( 0 . 0 3 - 0 . 0 1 2 ) \times 0 . 2 5 } = 1 2 0 5 . 4 1$ . The futures price for the six-month contract is $1 2 0 0 e ^ { ( 0 . 0 3 5 - 0 . 0 1 ) \times 0 . 5 } = 1 2 1 5 . 0 9$ .

If the six-month euro interest rate is $r _ { f }$ then   
1.1950  1.2000e(0.01rf )0.5   
so that   
$0 . 0 1 - r _ { f } = 2 \ln \left( { \frac { 1 . 1 9 5 0 } { 1 . 2 0 0 0 } } \right) = - 0 . 0 0 8 3 5$   
and $r _ { f } = 0 . 0 1 8 3 5$ . The six-month euro interest rate is $1 . 8 3 5 \%$ .  

# 5.25.  

The present value of the storage costs per barrel is $3 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 1 } = 2 . 8 5 4$ . An upper bound to the one-year futures price is $( 5 0 + 2 . 8 5 4 ) e ^ { \bar { 0 } . 0 5 \times 1 } = 5 5 . 5 6$ .  

# 5.26  

It is likely that the bank will price the product on assumption that the company chooses the delivery date least favorable to the bank. If the foreign interest rate is higher than the domestic interest rate, then:  

1. The earliest delivery date will be assumed when the company has a long position. 2. The latest delivery date will be assumed when the company has a short position. If the foreign interest rate is lower than the domestic interest rate, then: 1. The latest delivery date will be assumed when the company has a long position. 2. The earliest delivery date will be assumed when the company has a short position. If the company chooses a delivery which, from a purely financial viewpoint, is suboptimal the bank makes a gain.  

# 5.27  

The value of the contract to the bank at time $T _ { \mathrm { l } }$ is $S _ { 1 } { - } K _ { 1 }$ . The bank will choose $K _ { \scriptscriptstyle 2 }$ so that the new (rolled forward) contract has a value of $S _ { 1 } { - } K _ { 1 }$ . This means that  

$$
S _ { 1 } e ^ { - r _ { f } ( T _ { 2 } - T _ { 1 } ) } - K _ { 2 } e ^ { - r ( T _ { 2 } - T _ { 1 } ) } = S _ { 1 } - K _ { 1 }
$$  

where $r$ and $r _ { f }$ and the domestic and foreign risk-free rate observed at time $T _ { \mathrm { l } }$ and applicable to the period between time $T _ { \mathrm { 1 } }$ and $T _ { _ 2 }$ . This means that  

$$
K _ { 2 } = S _ { 1 } e ^ { ( r - r _ { f } ) ( T _ { 2 } - T _ { 1 } ) } - ( S _ { 1 } - K _ { 1 } ) e ^ { r ( T _ { 2 } - T _ { 1 } ) }
$$  

This equation shows that there are two components to $K _ { \scriptscriptstyle 2 }$ . The first is the forward price at time $T _ { \mathrm { l } }$ . The second is an adjustment to the forward price equal to the bank's gain on the first part of the contract compounded forward at the domestic risk-free rate.  

# CHAPTER 6 Interest Rate Futures  

# Practice Questions  

# 6.1  

There are 32 calendar days between July 7 and August 8. There are 184 calendar days between July 7 and January 7. The interest earned per $\$ 100$ of principal is therefore $3 . 5 \times 3 2 / 1 8 4 = \mathbb { S } 0 . 6 0 8 7$ . For a corporate bond, we assume 31 days between July 7 and August 8 and 180 days between July 7 and January 7. The interest earned is $3 . 5 \times 3 1 / 1 8 0 = \mathbb { S } 0 . 6 0 2 8$ .  

# 6.2  

There are 89 days between October 12 and January 9. There are 182 days between October 12 and April 12. The cash price of the bond is obtained by adding the accrued interest to the quoted price. The quoted price is $1 0 2 \frac { 7 } { 3 2 }$ or 102.21875. The cash price is therefore  

$$
1 0 2 . 2 1 8 7 5 + { \frac { 8 9 } { 1 8 2 } } \times 3 = \mathbb { S } 1 0 3 . 6 9
$$  

# 6.3  

The SOFR futures price has increased by 6 basis points. The investor makes a gain per contract of $2 5 \times 6 = \mathbb { S } 1 5 0$ or $\$ 300$ in total.  

6.4 From equation (6.4), the rate is  

$$
\frac { 3 . 2 \times 9 0 + 3 \times 3 5 0 } { 4 4 0 } = 3 . 0 4 0 9
$$  

or $3 . 0 4 0 9 \%$ .  

# 6.5  

The value of a contract is $1 0 8 \frac { 1 5 } { 3 2 } { \times } 1 , 0 0 0 = \$ 1 0 8 , 4 6 8 . 7 5$ . The number of contracts that should be shorted is  

$$
\frac { 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 } { 1 0 8 , 4 6 8 . 7 5 } \times \frac { 8 . 2 } { 7 . 6 } = 5 9 . 7
$$  

Rounding to the nearest whole number, 60 contracts should be shorted. The position should be closed out at the end of July.  

6.6 The cash price of the Treasury bill is  

$$
1 0 0 - \frac { 9 0 } { 3 6 0 } \times 1 0 = \mathcal { S } 9 7 . 5 0
$$  

The annualized continuously compounded return is  

$$
{ \frac { 3 6 5 } { 9 0 } } \ln \left( 1 + { \frac { 2 . 5 } { 9 7 . 5 } } \right) = 1 0 . 2 7 \%
$$  

6.7   
The number of days between January 27 and May 5 is 98. The number of days between   
January 27 and July 27 is 181. The accrued interest is therefore  

$$
6 \times { \frac { 9 8 } { 1 8 1 } } = 3 . 2 4 8 6
$$  

The quoted price is 110.5312. The cash price is therefore $1 1 0 . 5 3 1 2 + 3 . 2 4 8 6 = 1 1 3 . 7 7 9 8$ or $\$ 123.78$ .  

6.8   
The cheapest-to-deliver bond is the one for which Quoted Price  Futures Price $\times$ Conversion Factor   
is least. Calculating this factor for each of the 4 bonds, we get  

$\mathrm { B o n d } 1 : 1 2 5 . 1 5 6 2 5 - 1 0 1 . 3 7 5 \times 1 . 2 1 3 1 = 2 . 1 7 8$ Bond $2 : 1 4 2 . 4 6 8 7 5 - 1 0 1 . 3 7 5 \times 1 . 3 7 9 2 = 2 . 6 5 2$ Bond 3 115 96875 101 375 1 1149  2 946 Bon $\mathrm { ~ d } 4 : 1 4 4 . 0 6 2 5 0 - 1 0 1 . 3 7 5 \times 1 . 4 0 2 6 = 1 . 8 7 4$  

Bond 4 is therefore the cheapest to deliver.  

6.9   
There are 176 days between February 4 and July 30 and 181 days between February 4 and   
August 4. The cash price of the bond is, therefore:  

$$
1 1 0 + { \frac { 1 7 6 } { 1 8 1 } } \times 6 . 5 = 1 1 6 . 3 2
$$  

The rate of interest with continuous compounding is $2 \ln 1 . 0 6 = 0 . 1 1 6 5$ or $1 1 . 6 5 \%$ per annum. A coupon of 6.5 will be received in 5 days or 0.01370 years time. The present value of the coupon is  

$$
6 . 5 \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 1 3 7 0 \times 0 . 1 1 6 5 } = 6 . 4 9 0
$$  

The futures contract lasts for 62 days or 0.1699 years). The cash futures price if the contract were written on the $13 \%$ bond would be  

$$
( 1 1 6 . 3 2 - 6 . 4 9 0 ) e ^ { 0 . 1 6 9 9 \times 0 . 1 1 6 5 } = 1 1 2 . 0 3
$$  

At delivery, there are 57 days of accrued interest. The quoted futures price if the contract were written on the $13 \%$ bond would therefore be  

$$
1 1 2 . 0 3 - 6 . 5 \times \frac { 5 7 } { 1 8 4 } = 1 1 0 . 0 1
$$  

Taking the conversion factor into account, the quoted futures price should be:  

$$
\frac { 1 1 0 . 0 1 } { 1 . 5 } = 7 3 . 3 4
$$  

# 6.10  

If the bond to be delivered and the time of delivery were known, arbitrage would be straightforward. When the futures price is too high, the arbitrageur buys bonds and shorts an equivalent number of bond futures contracts. When the futures price is too low, the arbitrageur shorts bonds and goes long an equivalent number of bond futures contracts. Uncertainty as to which bond will be delivered introduces complications. The bond that appears cheapest-to-deliver now may not in fact be cheapest-to-deliver at maturity. In the case where the futures price is too high, this is not a major problem since the party with the short position (i.e., the arbitrageur) determines which bond is to be delivered. In the case where the futures price is too low, the arbitrageur's position is far more difficult since the bond to short is not known; it is unlikely that a profit can be locked in for all possible outcomes.  

# 6.11  

The forward interest rate for the time period between months 6 and 9 is $9 \%$ per annum with continuous compounding. This is because $9 \%$ per annum for three months when combined with $7 \%$ per annum for six months gives an average interest rate of $8 \%$ per annum for the nine-month period.  

With quarterly compounding, the forward interest rate is  

$$
4 ( e ^ { 0 . 0 9 / 4 } - 1 ) = 0 . 0 9 1 0 2
$$  

or $9 . 1 0 2 \%$ . This assumes that the day count is actual/365. With a day count of actual/360, the rate is $9 . 1 0 2 \times 3 6 0 / 3 6 5 = 8 . 9 7 7$ . The three-month SOFR quote for a contract maturing in six months is therefore  

$$
1 0 0 - 8 . 9 7 7 = 9 1 . 0 2 \
$$  

# 6.12  

The forward rates calculated form the first two Eurodollar futures are $4 . 1 7 \%$ and $4 . 3 8 \%$ . These are expressed with an actual/360 day count and quarterly compounding. With continuous compounding and an actual/365 day count, they are   
$4 \mathrm { l n } ( 1 + ( 0 . 0 4 1 7 / 4 ) \times ( 3 6 5 / 3 6 0 ) ) = 4 . 2 0 5 7 \%$ and $4 \mathrm { l n } ( 1 + ( 0 . 0 4 3 8 / 4 ) \times ( 3 6 5 / 3 6 0 ) ) { = } 4 . 4 1 6 4 \%$ It follows from equation (6.4) that the 398 day rate is   
$( 4 \times 3 0 0 + 4 . 2 0 5 7 \times 9 8 ) / 3 9 8 = 4 . 0 5 0 6$   
or $4 . 0 5 0 6 \%$ . The 489 day rate is   
$( 4 . 0 5 0 7 \times 3 9 8 + 4 . 4 1 6 7 \times 9 1 ) / 4 8 9 = 4 . 1 1 8 7$   
or $4 . 1 1 8 7 \%$ . We are assuming that the first futures rate applies to 98 days rather than the usual 91 days. The third futures quote is not needed.  

# 6.13  

Duration-based hedging procedures assume parallel shifts in the yield curve. Since the 12year rate tends to move by less than the 4-year rate, the portfolio manager may find that he or she is over-hedged.  

# 6.14  

The company treasurer can hedge the company's exposure by shorting Eurodollar futures contracts. The Eurodollar futures position leads to a profit if rates rise and a loss if they fall. The duration of the commercial paper is twice that of the Eurodollar deposit underlying the Eurodollar futures contract. The contract price of a Eurodollar futures contract is 980,000. The number of contracts that should be shorted is, therefore,  

$$
\frac { 4 , 8 2 0 , 0 0 0 } { 9 8 0 , 0 0 0 } \times 2 = 9 . 8 4
$$  

Rounding to the nearest whole number 10 contracts should be shorted.  

# 6.15  

The treasurer should short Treasury bond futures contract. If bond prices go down, this futures position will provide offsetting gains. The number of contracts that should be shorted is  

$$
{ \frac { 1 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \times 7 . 1 } { 9 1 , 3 7 5 \times 8 . 8 } } = 8 8 . 3 0
$$  

Rounding to the nearest whole number, 88 contracts should be shorted.  

# 6.16  

The answer in Problem 6.15 is designed to reduce the duration to zero. To reduce the duration from 7.1 to 3.0 instead of from 7.1 to 0, the treasurer should short  

$$
\frac { 4 . 1 } { 7 . 1 } \times 8 8 . 3 0 = 5 0 . 9 9
$$  

or 51 contracts.  

# 6.17  

You would prefer to own the Treasury bond. Under the 30/360 day count convention, there is one day between October 30 and November 1. Under the actual/actual (in period) day count convention, there are two days. Therefore, you would earn approximately twice as much interest by holding the Treasury bond.  

# 6.18  

We compound $3 \%$ (continuously compounded) for the first 60 days with $3 . 5 \%$ (quarterly compounded) for the next 90 days. $3 . 5 \%$ quarterly compounded is equivalent to $3 . 4 8 5 \%$ continuously compounded. The 150-day rate is $( 3 \times 6 0 ~ + 3 . 4 8 5 \times 9 0 ) / 1 5 0 = 3 . 2 9 \%$ with continuous compounding.  

# 6.19  

Suppose that the contracts apply to the interest rate between times $T _ { \mathrm { l } }$ and $T _ { _ 2 }$ . There are two reasons for a difference between the forward rate and the futures rate. The first is that the futures contract is settled daily whereas the forward contract is settled once at time $T _ { _ 2 }$ . The second is that without daily settlement a futures contract would be settled at time $T _ { \mathrm { l } }$ not $T _ { _ 2 }$ . Both reasons tend to make the futures rate greater than the forward rate.  

# 6.20  

The actual number of days between the last coupon date (Jan 27) and today is 70. The number of days between the last coupon (Jan 27) and the next coupon $( \mathrm { J u l } 2 7 )$ is 181. The accrued interest for the government bond is therefore $( 7 0 / 1 8 1 ) { \times } 3 = 1 . 1 6$ . The cash price of the bond is therefore 121.16.  Using a 30/360 day count, the number of days between Jan 27 and today is 70 and the number of days between Jan 27 and Jul 27 is 180. The accrued interest for the corporate bond is therefore $( 7 0 / 1 8 0 ) { \times } 3 = 1 . 1 7$ so that the cash price is 121.17.  

# 6.21  

The cash bond price is currently  

$$
1 3 7 + { \frac { 9 } { 1 8 4 } } \times 4 = 1 3 7 . 1 9 5 7
$$  

A coupon of 4 will be received after 175 days or 0.4795 years. The present value of the coupon on the bond is $4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 4 7 9 5 } { = } 3 . 9 0 5 3$ . The futures contract lasts 296 days or 0.8110 years. The cash futures price if it were written on the $8 \%$ bond would therefore be $( 1 3 7 . 1 9 5 7 - 3 . 9 0 5 3 ) e ^ { 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 8 1 1 0 } = 1 3 8 . 8 0 6 1$  

At delivery, there are 121 days of accrued interest. The quoted futures if the contract were written on the $8 \%$ bond would therefore be  

$$
1 3 8 . 8 0 6 1 - 4 \times \frac { 1 2 1 } { 1 8 1 } = 1 3 6 . 1 3 2 1
$$  

The quoted price should therefore be  

$$
\frac { 1 3 6 . 1 3 2 1 } { 1 . 2 1 9 1 } = 1 1 1 . 6 6
$$  

# 6.22  

The Eurodollar futures contract price of 97.95 means that the Eurodollar futures rate is $2 . 0 5 \%$   
per annum with quarterly compounding and an actual/360 day count. This becomes   
$2 . 0 5 { \times } 3 6 5 / 3 6 0 = 2 . 0 7 8 5 \%$ with an actual/actual day count. This is $4 \mathrm { l n } ( 1 + 0 . 2 5 { \times } 0 . 0 2 0 7 8 5 ) { = } 0 . 0 2 0 7 3 1$  

or $2 . 0 7 3 1 \%$ with continuous compounding. The forward rate given by the 90-day rate and the 180-day rate is $2 . 4 \%$ with continuous compounding. This suggests an investor can profitably borrow money for 90 days and invest for 180. A short position in a Eurodollar futures ensures that the funds can be rolled over at about $2 . 0 7 \%$ . The overall borrowing rate for the 180 days is about $2 . 0 3 5 \%$ whereas the rate earned is $2 . 2 \%$ .  

# 6.23  

The U.S. Eurodollar futures contract maturing at time $T$ enables an investor to lock in the forward rate for the period between $T$ and $T ^ { * }$ where $T ^ { * }$ is three months later than $T$ . If $\hat { r }$ is the forward rate, the U.S. dollar cash flows that can be locked in are  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } { - A e ^ { - \hat { r } ( T ^ { * } - T ) } } & { { } \mathrm { a t } \mathrm { t i m e } \quad T } \\ { + A } & { { } \mathrm { a t } \mathrm { t i m e } \quad T ^ { * } } \end{array}
$$  

where $A$ is the principal amount. To convert these to Canadian dollar cash flows, the Canadian company must enter into a short forward foreign exchange contract to sell Canadian dollars at time $T$ and a long forward foreign exchange contract to buy Canadian dollars at time $T ^ { * }$ . Suppose $F$ and $\boldsymbol { F } ^ { * }$ are the forward exchange rates for contracts maturing at times $T$ and $T ^ { * }$ . (These represent the number of Canadian dollars per U.S. dollar.) The Canadian dollars to be sold at time $T$ are  

$$
A e ^ { - \hat { r } ( T ^ { * } - T ) } F
$$  

and the Canadian dollars to be purchased at time $T ^ { * }$ are $A F ^ { * }$  

The forward contracts convert the U.S. dollar cash flows to the following Canadian dollar cash flows:  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } { - A e ^ { - \hat { r } ( T ^ { * } - T ) } F } & { { } \mathrm { a t } \mathrm { t i m e } \quad T } \\ { + A F ^ { * } } & { { } \mathrm { a t } \mathrm { t i m e } \quad T ^ { * } } \end{array}
$$  

This is a Canadian dollar LIBOR futures contract where the principal amount is $A F ^ { * }$ .  

6.24  

The number of short futures contracts required is  

$$
\frac { 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \times 4 . 0 } { 1 2 2 , 0 0 0 \times 9 . 0 } = 3 6 4 . 3
$$  

Rounding to the nearest whole number, 364 contracts should be shorted.  

This increases the number of contracts that should be shorted to  

$$
\frac { 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \times 4 . 0 } { 1 2 2 , 0 0 0 \times 7 . 0 } = 4 6 8 . 4
$$  

or 468 when we round to the nearest whole number.  

b) In this case, the gain on the short futures position is likely to be less than the loss on the bond portfolio. This is because the gain on the short futures position depends on the size of the movement in long-term rates and the loss on the bond portfolio depends on the size of the movement in medium-term rates. Duration-based hedging assumes that the movements in the two rates are the same.

A has an apparent comparative advantage in fixed-rate markets but wants to borrow floating. B has an apparent comparative advantage in floating-rate markets but wants to borrow fixed. This provides the basis for the swap. There is a $1 . 4 \%$ per annum differential between the fixed rates offered to the two companies and a $0 . 5 \%$ per annum differential between the floating rates offered to the two companies. The total gain to all parties from the swap is therefore $1 . 4 - 0 . 5 = 0 . 9 \%$ per annum. Because the bank gets $0 . 1 \%$ per annum of this gain, the swap should make each of A and B $0 . 4 \%$ per annum better off. This means that it should lead to A borrowing at $\mathrm { S O F R } - 0 . 3 \%$ and to B borrowing at $6 . 0 \%$ . The appropriate arrangement is therefore as shown in Figure S7.1.

# 7.2  

Consider the party paying floating. The first exchange involves paying $\$ 1.2$ million and receiving $\$ 2.0$ million in four months. It has a value of $0 . 8 \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 2 7 \bar { \times } 0 . \bar { 3 } 3 3 3 } = \mathbb { S } 0 . 7 9 2 8$ million. To value the second forward contract, we note that the forward interest rate is $3 \%$ per annum with semiannual compounding. The value of the forward contract is  

$$
1 0 0 \times { } ( 0 . 0 4 \times 0 . 5 \mathrm { - } 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 5 ) e ^ { - 0 . 0 2 7 \times 0 . 8 3 3 } \mathrm { = } \mathbb { S } 0 . 4 8 8 9 \ \mathrm { m i l l i o n }
$$  

The total value of the forward contracts is therefore $\$ 0.7928 +50.48 89=\ S 1.281 7$ . This is the value of the swap to the party paying floating. For the party paying fixed, the value is $- \$ 1.2817$ .  

# 7.3  

X has a comparative advantage in yen markets but wants to borrow dollars. Y has a comparative advantage in dollar markets but wants to borrow yen. This provides the basis for the swap. There is a $1 . 5 \%$ per annum differential between the yen rates and a $0 . 4 \%$ per annum differential between the dollar rates. The total gain to all parties from the swap is therefore $1 . 5 - 0 . 4 = 1 . 1 \%$ per annum. The bank requires $0 . 5 \%$ per annum, leaving $0 . 3 \%$ per annum for each of X and Y. The swap should lead to X borrowing dollars at $9 . 6 - 0 . 3 = 9 . 3 \ \%$ per annum and to Y borrowing yen at $6 . 5 - 0 . 3 = 6 . 2 \%$ per annum. The appropriate arrangement is therefore as shown in Figure S7.2. All foreign exchange risk is borne by the bank.

# 7.4  

The swap involves exchanging the sterling interest of $2 0 \times 0 . 1 0$ or £2 million for the dollar interest of $3 0 \times 0 . 0 6 = \mathcal { S } 1 . 8$ million. The principal amounts are also exchanged at the end of the life of the swap. The value of the sterling bond underlying the swap is  

$$
{ \frac { 2 } { ( 1 . 0 7 ) ^ { 1 / 4 } } } + { \frac { 2 2 } { ( 1 . 0 7 ) ^ { 5 / 4 } } } = 2 2 . 1 8 2 { \mathrm { ~ m i l l i o n ~ p o u n d s } }
$$  

The value of the dollar bond underlying the swap is  

$$
{ \frac { 1 . 8 } { ( 1 . 0 4 ) ^ { 1 / 4 } } } + { \frac { 3 1 . 8 } { ( 1 . 0 4 ) ^ { 5 / 4 } } } = \ S 3 2 . 0 6 1 \ \mathrm { m i l l i o n }
$$  

The value of the swap to the party paying sterling is therefore  

The value of the swap to the party paying dollars is $\$ 2.321$ million. The results can also be obtained by viewing the swap as a portfolio of forward contracts. The continuously compounded interest rates in sterling and dollars are $6 . 7 6 6 \%$ per annum and $3 . 9 2 2 \%$ per annum. The 3-month and 15-month forward exchange rates are $1 . 5 5 \mathrm { e } ^ { ( 0 . 0 3 9 2 2 - 0 . 0 6 7 6 6 ) \times 0 . 2 \bar { 5 } } = 1 . 5 3 9 0$ and $1 . 5 5 \mathrm { e } ^ { ( 0 . 0 3 9 2 2 - 0 . 0 6 7 6 6 ) \times 1 . 2 5 } = 1 . 4 9 5 9$ . The values of the two forward contracts corresponding to the exchange of interest for the party paying sterling are therefore $( 1 . 8 { - } 2 { \times } 1 . { \dot { 5 } } 3 9 0 ) { \dot { \mathrm { e } } } ^ { - 0 . { \dot { 0 } } 3 9 2 { \dot { 2 } } { \times } 0 . 2 5 } = { - } \bar { \ S } 1 . 2 6 5 6$ million  

and  

$$
( 1 . 8 – 2 \times 1 . 4 9 5 9 ) \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 3 9 2 2 \times 1 . 2 5 } = - \$ 1 . 1 3 4 7
$$  

The value of the forward contract corresponding to the exchange of principals is $( 3 0 - 2 0 { \times } 1 . 4 9 5 9 ) \dot { \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 3 9 2 2 { \times } \overline { { 1 } } . 2 5 } } = + \mathbb { S } 0 . 0 7 8 7$ million  

The total value of the swap $\mathrm { i s - \mathbb { S } 1 . 2 6 5 6 - \mathbb { S } 1 . 1 3 4 7 ~ + \mathbb { S } 0 . 0 7 8 7 }$ million or $- \$ 2.322$ million (which allowing for rounding errors is the same as that given by valuing bonds).  

# 7.5  

Credit risk arises from the possibility of a default by the counterparty. Market risk arises from movements in market variables such as interest rates and exchange rates. A complication is that the credit risk in a swap is contingent on the values of market variables. For example, suppose that a company has a single bilaterally cleared swap with a counterparty. The company's has credit risk only when the value of the swap to the company is positive.  

# 7.6  

The rate is not truly fixed because, if the company's credit rating declines, it will not be able to roll over its floating rate borrowings at floating plus 150 basis points. The effective fixed borrowing rate then increases. Suppose, for example, that the treasurer's spread over floating increases from 150 basis points to 200 basis points. The borrowing rate increases from $5 . 2 \%$  

to $5 . 7 \%$ .  

# 7.7  

At the start of the swap, the contract has a value of approximately zero. As time passes, it is likely that the swap value will change. If at the time of a counterparty default, the swap has a positive value to the bank and a negative value to the counterparty, the bank is likely to lose money. If the yield curve is upward sloping, the early exchanges are expected to be negative to the bank and the later exchanges are expected to be positive to the bank. This means that the swap is expected to have a positive value as time passes and, as a result, the bank's credit exposure is relatively high. When the yield curve is downward sloping, the early exchanges are expected to be positive to the bank and the later exchanges are expected to be negative to the bank. This means that the swap is expected to have a negative value as time passes and, as a result, the bank's credit exposure is relatively low.  

# 7.8  

The spread between the interest rates offered to $\mathrm { \Delta X }$ and $\mathrm { Y }$ is $0 . 8 \%$ per annum on fixed rate investments and $0 . 0 \%$ per annum on floating rate investments. This means that the total apparent benefit to all parties from the swap is $0 . 8 \%$ per annum.  Of this, $0 . 2 \%$ per annum will go to the bank. This leaves $0 . 3 \%$ per annum for each of X and Y. In other words, company X should be able to get a fixed-rate return of $8 . 3 \%$ per annum while company Y should be able to get a floating-rate return $\mathrm { L I B O R } + 0 . 3 \%$ per annum. The required swap is shown in Figure S7.3. The bank earns $0 . 2 \%$ , company X earns $8 . 3 \%$ , and company Y earns $\mathrm { L I B O R } + 0 . 3 \%$ .  

![](images/f0a4748b7c22aa10d0eede44327d9778fd29d050e6a07f07a52c20344b794921.jpg)

# 7.9  

At the end of year 3, the financial institution was due to receive $\$ 200,000$ $( = 0 . 5 \times 4 \%$ of $\$ 10$ million) and pay $\$ 150,000$ $( = 0 . 5 \times 3 \%$ of $\$ 10$ million). The immediate loss is therefore $\$ 50,000$ . To value the remaining swap, we assume that LIBOR forward rates are realized. All forward rates are $2 \%$ per annum. The remaining cash flows are therefore valued on the assumption that the floating payment is $0 . 5 \times 0 . 0 2 \times 1 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 = \mathbb { S } 1 0 0 , 0 0 0$ . The fixed payment is $\$ 200,000$ and the net payment that would be received is $2 0 0 , 0 0 0 - 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 =$ $\$ 100,000$ . The total cost of default is therefore the cost of foregoing the following cash flows:  

3 year: $\$ 50,000$   
3.5 year: $\$ 100,000$   
4 year: $\$ 100,000$   
4.5 year: $\$ 100,000$   
5 year: $\$ 100,000$  

Discounting these cash flows to year 3 at $1 . 8 \%$ per annum, we obtain the cost of the default as $\$ 441,120$ .  

7.10 When interest rates are compounded annually  

$$
F _ { 0 } = S _ { 0 } \Bigg ( \frac { 1 + r } { 1 + r _ { f } } \Bigg ) ^ { T }
$$  

where $F _ { 0 }$ is the $T .$ -year forward rate, $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } }$ is the spot rate, $r$ is the domestic risk-free rate, and $r _ { f }$ is the foreign risk-free rate. As $r = 0 . 0 8$ and $r _ { f } = 0 . 0 3$ , the spot and forward exchange rates at the end of year 6 are as follows:  

Spot: 0.8000   
1 year forward: 0.8388   
2 year forward: 0.8796   
3 year forward: 0.9223   
4 year forward: 0.9670  

The value of the swap at the time of the default can be calculated on the assumption that forward rates are realized. The cash flows lost as a result of the default are therefore as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Year</td><td>Dollar Paid</td><td>CHF Received</td><td>Forward Rate</td><td>Dollar Equiv of CHF Received</td><td>Cash Flow Lost</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>560,000</td><td>300,000</td><td>0.8000</td><td>240,000</td><td>-320,000</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>560,000</td><td>300,000</td><td>0.8388</td><td>251,600</td><td>-308,400</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>560,000</td><td>300,000</td><td>0.8796</td><td>263,900</td><td>-296,100</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>560,000</td><td>300,000</td><td>0.9223</td><td>276,700</td><td>-283,300</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>7,560,000</td><td>10,300,000</td><td>0.9670</td><td>9,960,100</td><td>2,400,100</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Discounting the numbers in the final column to the end of year 6 at $8 \%$ per annum, the cost of the default is $\$ 679,800$ .  

Note that, if company $\mathrm { Y }$ had no other business beside this swap, it would make no sense for the company to default just before the exchange of payments at the end of year 6 as the exchange has a positive value to company Y. In practice, company Y may be defaulting and declaring bankruptcy for reasons unrelated to this particular transaction.  

# 7.11  

Company A has a comparative advantage in the Canadian dollar fixed-rate market. Company B has a comparative advantage in the U.S. dollar floating-rate market. (This may be because of their tax positions.) However, company A wants to borrow in the U.S. dollar floating-rate market and company B wants to borrow in the Canadian dollar fixed-rate market. This gives rise to the swap opportunity.  

The differential between the U.S. dollar floating rates is $0 . 5 \%$ per annum, and the differential between the Canadian dollar fixed rates is $1 . 5 \%$ per annum. The difference between the differentials is $1 \%$ per annum. The total potential gain to all parties from the swap is therefore $1 \%$ per annum, or 100 basis points. If the financial intermediary requires 50 basis points, each of A and B can be made 25 basis points better off. Thus, a swap can be designed so that it provides A with U.S. dollars at Floating $+ 0 . 2 5 \%$ per annum, and B with Canadian dollars at $6 . 2 5 \%$ per annum. The swap is shown in Figure S7.4.  

![](images/96009d19791378084d4245ed9bcf4f74d58fd956be71f4a528e1fdbb402925c4.jpg)  
Figure S7.4 Swap for Problem 7.11  

Principal payments flow in the opposite direction to the arrows at the start of the life of the swap and in the same direction as the arrows at the end of the life of the swap. The financial institution would be exposed to some foreign exchange risk which could be hedged using forward contracts.  

# 7.12  

The financial institution will have to buy $1 . 1 \%$ of the AUD principal in the forward market for each year of the life of the swap. Since AUD interest rates are higher than dollar interest rates, AUD is at a discount in forward markets. This means that the AUD purchased for year 2 is less expensive than that purchased for year 1; the AUD purchased for year 3 is less expensive than that purchased for year 2; and so on. This works in favor of the financial institution and means that its spread increases with time. The spread is always above 20 basis points.  

# 7.13  

Consider two offsetting plain vanilla interest rate swaps that a financial institution enters into with companies X and Y. We suppose that X is paying fixed and receiving floating while Y is paying floating and receiving fixed.  

The quote suggests that company X will usually be less creditworthy than company Y. (Company X might be a BBB-rated company that has difficulty in accessing fixed-rate markets directly; company Y might be a AAA-rated company that has no difficulty accessing fixed or floating rate markets.) Presumably, company X wants fixed-rate funds and company Y wants floating-rate funds.  

The financial institution will realize a loss if company Y defaults when rates are high or if company X defaults when rates are low. These events are relatively unlikely since (a) Y is unlikely to default in any circumstances, and (b) defaults are less likely to happen when rates are low. For the purposes of illustration, suppose that the probabilities of various events are as follows:  

Default by Y: 0.001   
Default by X: 0.010   
Rates high when default occurs: 0.7   
Rates low when default occurs: 0.3  

The probability of a loss is $0 . 0 0 1 \times 0 . 7 + 0 . 0 1 0 \times 0 . 3 = 0 . 0 0 3 7$  

If the roles of X and Y in the swap had been reversed, the probability of a loss would be $0 . 0 0 1 { \times } 0 . 3 + 0 . 0 1 0 { \times } 0 . 7 = 0 . 0 0 7 3$  

Assuming companies are more likely to default when interest rates are high, the above argument shows that the observation in quotes has the effect of decreasing the risk of a financial institution's swap portfolio. It is worth noting that the assumption that defaults are more likely when interest rates are high is open to question. The assumption is motivated by the thought that high interest rates often lead to financial difficulties for corporations. However, the empirical evidence on whether defaults are more likely when interest rates are high is mixed.  

# 7.14  

In an interest-rate swap, a financial institution's exposure depends on the difference between a fixed-rate of interest and a floating-rate of interest. It has no exposure to the notional principal. In a loan, the whole principal can be lost.  

# 7.15  

The bank is paying a floating-rate on the deposits and receiving a fixed-rate on the loans. It can offset its risk by entering into interest rate swaps (with other financial institutions or corporations) in which it contracts to pay fixed and receive floating.  

# 7.16  

Suppose that floating payments are made in currency A and fixed payments are made in currency B. The floating payments can be valued in currency A by (i) assuming that the forward rates are realized, and (ii) discounting the resulting cash flows at appropriate currency A discount rates. Suppose that the value is $V _ { _ A }$ . The fixed payments can be valued in currency B by discounting them at the appropriate currency B discount rates. Suppose that the value is $V _ { _ B }$ . If $\boldsymbol { \mathcal { Q } }$ is the current exchange rate (number of units of currency A per unit of currency B), the value of the swap in currency A is $V _ { _ A } - Q V _ { _ B }$ . Alternatively, it is $V _ { _ A } / Q - V _ { _ B }$ in currency B.  

7.17   
The value in millions of dollars is   
$( 0 . 0 3 - 0 . 0 3 4 ) \times 1 0 0 / 1 . 0 3 4 + ( 0 . 0 3 - 0 . 0 3 4 ) { \times } 1 0 0 / 1 . 0 3 4 ^ { 2 } = - 0 . 7 6$  

# 7.18  

With continuous compounding, the forward rate for the first exchange is $2 . 7 5 \%$ (the average   
of $2 . 7 \%$ and $2 . 8 \%$ . For the second exchange, it is $( 3 \times 4 . 5 - 2 . 8 \times 1 . 5 ) / 3$ or $3 . 1 \%$ . For the final   
exchange, it is $( 3 . 1 \times 7 . 5 - 3 \times 4 . 5 ) / 3$ or $3 . 2 5 \%$ . These rates become $2 . 7 5 9 5 \%$ , $3 . 1 1 2 \%$ , and   
$3 . 2 6 3 2 \%$ with quarterly compounding. The value of the swap in millions of dollars is   
therefore   
1 $0 0 [ 0 . 2 5 ( 0 . 0 2 7 5 9 5 - 0 . 0 3 ) \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 2 8 \times 0 . 1 2 5 } + 0 . 2 5 ( 0 . 0 3 1 1 - 0 . 0 3 ) \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 3 7 5 } + 0 . 2 5 ( 0 . 0 3 2 6 3 2 - 0 . 0 3 ) \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 3 1 1 } ]$   
$0 . 0 3 ) \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 3 1 \times 0 . 6 1 2 5 } ]$   
$= 0 . 0 3 2$  

# 7.19  

(a)  Company A can pay floating and receive $3 . 0 5 \%$ for three years. It can therefore   
exchange a loan at $3 . 4 5 \%$ into a loan at floating plus $0 . 4 0 \%$ ,   
(b) Company B can receive floating and pay $3 . 3 0 \%$ for five years. It can therefore exchange a loan at floating plus $0 . 7 5 \%$ for a loan at $4 . 0 5 \%$ . But there is a danger that the spread it pays over floating on the loan increases during the five years.  

7.20 The swap with a fixed rate of $3 . 2 \%$ is worth zero. The value of the first exchange to the party  

receiving fixed per dollar of principal is  

$$
\frac { 0 . 0 3 2 - 0 . 0 3 0 } { 1 . 0 2 5 } = 0 . 0 0 1 9 5 1
$$  

The value of the second exchange is  

$$
\frac { 0 . 0 3 2 - 0 . 0 3 2 } { 1 . 0 2 7 \ L ^ { 2 } } = 0 . 0 0
$$  

The value of the third exchange is  

$$
\frac { 0 . 0 3 2 - R } { 1 . 0 2 9 ^ { 3 } }
$$  

Hence  

$$
\frac { 0 . 0 3 2 - R } { 1 . 0 2 9 ^ { 3 } } = - 0 . 0 0 1 9 5 1
$$  

so that $R = 0 . 0 3 4 1 2 6$ or $3 . 4 1 2 6 \%$ .  

A swap where $4 \%$ is received on a principal of $\$ 100$ million provides $0 . 8 \%$ of $\$ 100$ million or $\$ 800,000$ per year more than a swap worth zero. Its value is  

$$
\frac { 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 } { 1 . 0 2 5 } + \frac { 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 } { 1 . 0 2 7 ^ { 2 } } + \frac { 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 } { 1 . 0 2 9 ^ { 3 } } = 2 , 2 7 3 , 2 2 6
$$  

or about $\$ 2.27$ million.  

7.21 We can value the swap as a series of forward rate agreements. The value in $\$ 5$ millions is  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { 0 . 8 - 0 . 9 ) e ^ { \tau ^ { 0 . 0 3 8 \times 2 / 1 2 } } + ( 1 . 0 - 0 . 9 ) e ^ { \tau ^ { 0 . 0 3 8 \times 5 / 1 2 } } + ( 1 . 0 - 0 . 9 ) e ^ { \tau ^ { 0 . 0 3 8 \times 8 / 1 2 } + } ( 1 . 0 - 0 . 9 ) e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 8 \times 1 1 / 1 2 } } \\ & { - ( 1 . 0 - 0 . 9 ) e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 8 \times 1 4 / 1 2 } = 0 . 2 8 9 } \end{array}
$$  

# 7.22  

The spread between the interest rates offered to A and $\mathbf { B }$ is $0 . 4 \%$ (or 40 basis points) on sterling loans and $0 . 8 \%$ (or 80 basis points) on U.S. dollar loans. The total benefit to all parties from the swap is therefore  

It is therefore possible to design a swap which will earn 10 basis points for the bank while making each of A and B 15 basis points better off than they would be by going directly to financial markets. One possible swap is shown in Figure S7.5. Company A borrows at an effective rate of $6 . 8 5 \%$ per annum in U.S. dollars.  

Company B borrows at an effective rate of $1 0 . 4 5 \%$ per annum in sterling. The bank earns a 10-basis-point spread. The way in which currency swaps such as this operate is as follows: Principal amounts in dollars and sterling that are roughly equivalent are chosen. These principal amounts flow in the opposite direction to the arrows at the time the swap is initiated. Interest payments then flow in the same direction as the arrows during the life of the swap and the principal amounts flow in the same direction as the arrows at the end of the life of the swap.  

Note that the bank is exposed to some exchange rate risk in the swap. It earns 65 basis points in U.S. dollars and pays 55 basis points in sterling. This exchange rate risk could be hedged using forward contracts.

We know that exchanging $4 \%$ for floating is worth zero. Receiving $4 . 2 \%$ in exchange for LIBOR is therefore worth the present value of $0 . 5 \times ( 0 . 0 4 2 - 0 . 0 4 ) \times \ S 1 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 = \ S 1 0 , 0 0 0$ received every six months for five years. This is

# 8.2  

The increase in the price of houses was caused by an increase in the demand for houses by people who could not afford them. It was therefore unsustainable.  

# 8.3  

Subprime mortgages were frequently securitized. The only information that was retained during the securitization process was the applicant's FICO score and the loan-to-value ratio of the mortgage.  

# 8.4  

Investors underestimated how high the default correlations between mortgages would be in stressed market conditions. Investors also did not always realize that the tranches underlying ABS CDOs were usually quite thin so that they were either totally wiped out or untouched. There was an unfortunate tendency to assume that a tranche with a particular rating could be considered to be the same as a bond with that rating. This assumption is not valid for the reasons just mentioned.  

# 8.5  

Typically an ABS CDO is created from the BBB-rated tranches of an ABS. This is because it is difficult to find investors in a direct way for the BBB-rated tranches of an ABS.  

# 8.6  

Consider the structure in Figure 8.1. Assume that there are 1,000 assets each with a principal of $\$ 100,000$ . Suppose that all the assets have a $5 \%$ chance of defaulting during the life of the ABS and there will be a $50 \%$ recovery. For the senior tranche to be affected, there have to be at least 400 defaults. When default correlation is zero, there is virtually no chance of this. As default correlation increases, 400 defaults become more likely. In the limit as the correlation approaches one, there is a $5 \%$ chance that all 1,000 will default.  

As default correlation increases, the equity tranche becomes less risky. When the default correlation is low, some defaults are almost certain to happen so that the equity tranche experiences losses. As the default correlation increases, it becomes less likely that there will be defaults. In the limit as the correlation approaches one, there is a $9 5 \%$ chance that there will be no defaults and the equity tranche experiences no losses.  

8.7  

As indicated in Table 8.1, a moderately high loss rate will wipe out the mezzanine tranches of ABSs so that the AAA-rated tranche of the ABS CDO is also wiped out. A moderately high loss rate will at worst wipe out only part of the AAA-rated tranche of an ABS.

The end-of-year bonus usually reflects performance during the year. This type of compensation tends to lead traders and other employees of banks to focus on their next bonus and therefore have a short-term time horizon for their decision making.

When the AAA-rated tranches of an ABS experiences defaults, the mezzanine tranches of the ABSs must have been wiped out. As a result, the AAA tranche of the ABS CDO has also wiped out. If the portfolios underlying the different ABSs have the same default rates, it must therefore be the case the AAA-rated tranche of the ABS is safer than the AAA-rated tranche of the ABS CDO. If there is a wide variation in the default rates, it is possible for the AAArated tranche of the ABS CDO to fare better than some (but not all) AAA-rated tranches of the underlying ABSs.  

Resecuritization can only be successful if the default rates of the underlying ABS portfolios are not highly correlated. The best approach would seem to be to obtain as much diversification as possible in the portfolio of assets underlying the ABS. Resecuritization then has no value.  

# 8.12  

For losses to be experienced on the AAA-rated tranche of the CDO squared, the loss rate on the mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDOs must be greater than $3 5 \%$ . This happens when the loss rate on the mezzanine tranches of ABSs is $1 0 + 0 . 3 5 \times 2 5 = 1 8 . 7 5 \%$ . This loss rate  

occurs when the loss rate on the underlying assets is $5 + 0 . 1 8 7 5 \times 1 5 = 7 . 8 1 \%$

# Practice Questions  

9.1 Financial economists argue that the cost of funding margin should be related to its risk (which is fairly low). Most practitioners consider that the cost should be the bank's average funding cost.  

# 9.2  

Many practitioners calculate KVA by arguing that there is a cost if a bank does something that requires additional regulatory capital and that the incremental return on the regulatory capital should be at least the return required by shareholders. A financial economist would argue against this if the project is less risky than the average project undertaken by the bank because the project will lower the average risk of the bank and therefore lower the return required by equity holders.  

# 9.3  

FVA is concerned with variation margin. The variation margin for a portfolio is the sum of the variation margins for the transactions in the portfolio. (As indicated in footnote 13 of Chapter 9, this is only approximately true when the impact of defaults on funding is considered.) MVA is concerned with initial margin which (at least in the case of CCPs) is calculated at the portfolio level.  (Note: The standard regulatory approach to setting initial margin for bilaterally cleared derivatives does not permit netting. However, the industry has come up with SIMM, Standard Initial Margin Model, which does allow netting.)  

# 9.4  

$\mathrm { C V A } = 0 . 0 3 \times 6 + 0 . 0 3 \times 5 + 0 . 0 3 \times 4 = 0 . 4 5$ The DVA is zero because the value of the transaction to the counterparty is negative.  

# 9.5  

The DVA for a bank depends on a single credit spread (its own) whereas CVA depends on the credit spread of all the bank's counterparties. On any given day, some counterparty spreads can be expected to go up while others go down so that there are some offsets. DVA can therefore be expected to be more volatile.  

# 9.6.  

If it chooses debt, the equity becomes more risky and the expected return of equity holders increases. If it chooses equity, the equity becomes less risky and the expected return required by equity holders goes down.  

# 9.7.  

A netting agreement states that all transactions are considered to be a single transaction in the event of a default. Transactions with a positive value are netted against transactions with a negative value. This usually reduces exposure because a company cannot cherry pick which transactions it will default on. Credit risk is not affected by netting when all transactions will have a positive value at all times or when all transactions have a negative value at all times.  

9.8.   
The average funding cost should come down. The company will become less risky. Its average funding cost should be a weighted average of $5 \%$ for the old projects and $3 \%$ for the new ones. This is $0 . 9 \times 5 \% + 0 . 1 \times 3 \%$ or $4 . 8 \%$ .

# Practice Questions  

# 10.1  

The investor makes a profit if the price of the stock on the expiration date is less than $\$ 37$ . In these circumstances, the gain from exercising the option is greater than $\$ 3$ . The option will be exercised if the stock price is less than $\$ 40$ at the maturity of the option. The variation of the investor's profit with the stock price in Figure S10.1.

Figure S10.1:  Investor's profit in Problem 10.1  

# 10.2  

The investor makes a profit if the price of the stock is below $\$ 54$ on the expiration date. If the stock price is below $\$ 50$ , the option will not be exercised, and the investor makes a profit of $\$ 4$ . If the stock price is between $\$ 50$ and $\$ 54$ , the option is exercised and the investor makes a profit between $\$ 0$ and $\$ 4$ . The variation of the investor's profit with the stock price is as shown in Figure S10.2.

10.3 The payoff to the investor is  

$$
- \mathrm { m a x } \left( S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } - K , 0 \right) + \mathrm { m a x } \left( K - S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } , 0 \right)
$$  

This is $K - S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T }$ in all circumstances. The investor's position is the same as a short position in a forward contract with delivery price $K$ .  

# 10.4  

The strike price is reduced to $\$ 30$ , and the option gives the holder the right to purchase twice as many shares.  

# 10.5  

The exercise of employee stock options usually leads to new shares being issued by the company and sold to the employee. This changes the amount of equity in the capital structure. When a regular exchange-traded option is exercised, no new shares are issued and the company's capital structure is not affected.  

# 10.6  

\Ignoring the time value of money, the holder of the option will make a profit if the stock price at maturity of the option is greater than $\$ 105$ . This is because the payoff to the holder of the option is, in these circumstances, greater than the $\$ 5$ paid for the option. The option will be exercised if the stock price at maturity is greater than $\$ 100$ . Note that if the stock price is between $\$ 100$ and $\$ 105$ , the option is exercised but the holder of the option takes a loss overall. The profit from a long position is as shown in Figure S10.3.  

![](images/c3b78b74e6c89ec6baf1962822757bb9b371a79342822fb45072c0e999071957.jpg)

# 10.7  

Ignoring the time value of money, the seller of the option will make a profit if the stock price at maturity is greater than $\$ 52.00$ . This is because the cost to the seller of the option is in these circumstances less than the price received for the option. The option will be exercised if the stock price at maturity is less than $\$ 60.00$ . Note that if the stock price is between $\$ 52.00$ and $\$ 60.00$ , the seller of the option makes a profit even though the option is exercised. The profit from the short position is as shown in Figure S10.4.

Figure S10.4:  Profit from short position in Problem 10.7  

10.8 The terminal value of the long forward contract is:  

$$
S _ { T } - F _ { 0 }
$$  

where $S _ { \ / r }$ is the price of the asset at maturity and $F _ { 0 }$ is the forward price of the asset at the time the portfolio is set up. (The delivery price in the forward contract is also $F _ { 0 }$ .) The terminal value of the put option is:  

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } { ( F _ { 0 } - S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } , 0 ) }
$$  

The terminal value of the portfolio is therefore:  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { S _ { T } - F _ { 0 } + \operatorname* { m a x } { ( F _ { 0 } - S _ { T } , 0 ) } } \\ { = \operatorname* { m a x } { ( 0 , S _ { T } - F _ { 0 } ) } } \end{array}
$$  

This is the same as the terminal value of a European call option with the same maturity as the forward contract and an exercise price equal to $F _ { 0 }$ . This result is illustrated in Figure S10.5.  

![](images/36e78f6539e0da47dcc44f494761a586d20467fdca7183277111bb91c430d647.jpg)  
Figure S10.5:  Profit from portfolio in Problem 10.8  

We have shown that the forward contract plus the put is worth the same as a call with the same strike price and time to maturity as the put. The forward contract is worth zero at the time the portfolio is set up. It follows that the put is worth the same as the call at the time the portfolio is set up.  

# 10.9  

Figure S10.6 shows the variation of the trader's position with the asset price. We can divide the alternative asset prices into three ranges:  

a) When the asset price less than $\$ 40$ , the put option provides a payoff of $4 0 - S _ { T }$ and the call option provides no payoff. The options cost $\$ 7$ and so the total profit is $3 3 - S _ { T }$ .   
b) When the asset price is between $\$ 40$ and $\$ 45$ , neither option provides a payoff. There is a net loss of $\$ 7$ .   
c) When the asset price greater than $\$ 45$ , the call option provides a payoff of $S _ { T } - 4 5$ and the put option provides no payoff. Taking into account the $\$ 7$ cost of the options, the total profit is $S _ { T } - 5 2$ .  

The trader makes a profit (ignoring the time value of money) if the stock price is less than $\$ 33$ or greater than $\$ 52$ . This type of trading strategy is known as a strangle and is discussed in Chapter 12.

# 10.10  

The holder of an American option has all the same rights as the holder of a European option and more. It must therefore be worth at least as much. If it were not, an arbitrageur could short the European option and take a long position in the American option.  

# 10.11  

The holder of an American option has the right to exercise it immediately. The American option must therefore be worth at least as much as its intrinsic value. If it were not, an arbitrageur could lock in a sure profit by buying the option and exercising it immediately.  

# 10.12  

Forward contracts lock in the exchange rate that will apply to a particular transaction in the future. Options provide insurance that the exchange rate will not be worse than some level. The advantage of a forward contract is that uncertainty is eliminated as far as possible. The disadvantage is that the outcome with hedging can be significantly worse than the outcome with no hedging. This disadvantage is not as marked with options. However, unlike forward contracts, options involve an up-front cost.  

# 10.13  

a) The option contract becomes one to buy $5 0 0 \times 1 . 1 = 5 5 0$ shares with an exercise price $4 0 / 1 . 1 = 3 6 . 3 6$ .   
b) There is no effect. The terms of an options contract are not normally adjusted for cash dividends.   
c) The option contract becomes one to buy $5 0 0 \times 4 = 2 , 0 0 0$ shares with an exercise price of $4 0 / 4 = \$ 10$ .  

10.14 The exchange has certain rules governing when trading in a new option is initiated. These mean that the option is close-to-the-money when it is first traded. If all call options are in the money, it is therefore likely that the stock price has increased since trading in the option began.  

# 10.15  

An unexpected cash dividend would reduce the stock price on the ex-dividend date. This stock price reduction would not be anticipated by option holders. As a result, there would be a reduction in the value of a call option and an increase in the value of a put option. (Note that the terms of an option are adjusted for cash dividends only in exceptional circumstances.)  

# 10.16  

a) March, April, June, and September b) July, August, September, and December c) August, September, December, and March.  

Longer dated options may also trade.  

# 10.17  

A "fair" price for the option can reasonably be assumed to be half way between the bid and the ask price quoted by a market maker. An investor typically buys at the market maker's ask and sells at the market maker's bid. Each time he or she does this, there is a hidden cost equal to half the bid-ask spread.  

# 10.18  

The two calculations are necessary to determine the initial margin. The first gives $5 0 0 \times ( 3 . 5 + 0 . 2 \times 5 7 - 3 ) = 5 , 9 5 0$  

The second gives  

$$
5 0 0 \times ( 3 . 5 + 0 . 1 { \times } 5 7 ) = 4 , 6 0 0
$$  

The initial margin is the greater of these, or $\$ 5,950$ . Part of this can be provided by the initial amount of $5 0 0 \times 3 . 5 = \ S 1 , 7 5$ 0 received for the options.  

# 10.19  

For strike prices of 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, and 340, the intrinsic values of call options are 26, 16,  6, 0, 0, and 0. The mid-market values of the options are 39.875, 33.20, 26.80, 21.075, 16.05, and 11.675. The time values of the options are given by what is left from the mid-market value after the intrinsic value has been subtracted. They are 13.875, 17.20, 20.80, 21.075, 16.05, and 11.675, respectively.   
For strike prices of 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, and 340, the intrinsic values of put options are  0, 0, 0, 4, 14, and 24. The mid-market values of the options are 13.175, 16.35, 20.125, 24.425, 29.30, and 35.05. The time values of the options are given by what is left from the midmarket value after the intrinsic value has been subtracted. They are 13.175, 16.35, 20.125, 15.30, and 11.05, respectively.  

Note that for both puts and calls, the time value is greatest when the option is close to being at-the-money.  

# 10.20  

(a) The margin requirement is the greater of $5 0 0 { \times } ( 1 0 + 0 . 2 { \times } 5 8 ) = 1 0 , 8 0 0$ and $5 0 0 \times ( 1 0 + 0 . 1 \times 6 4 ) = 8 { , } 2 0 0$ . It is $\$ 10,800$ .  

(b) The margin requirement is the greater of $5 0 0 \times ( 1 0 + 0 . 1 5 \times 5 8 ) = 9 , 3 5 0$ and $5 0 0 \times ( 1 0 + 0 . 1 \times 6 4 ) = 8 { , } 2 0 0$ . It is $\$ 9,350$ .   
(c) The margin requirement is the greater of $5 0 0 \small { \times } ( 1 0 \small { + } 0 . 2 \times 7 0 \small { - } 6 ) = 9 , 0 0 0$ and $5 0 0 \times ( 1 0 + 0 . 1 \times 6 4 ) = 8 { , } 2 0 0$ . It is $\$ 9,000$ .   
(d) No margin is required if the trader is buying.  

# 10.21  

Executive stock option plans account for a high percentage of the total remuneration received by executives. When the market is rising fast, many corporate executives do very well out of their stock option plans—even when their company does worse than its competitors. Large institutional investors have argued that executive stock options should be structured so that the payoff depends on how the company has performed relative to an appropriate industry index. In a regular executive stock option, the strike price is the stock price at the time the option is issued. In the type of relative-performance stock option favored by institutional investors, the strike price at time $t$ is $S _ { 0 } I _ { t } / I _ { 0 }$ where $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } }$ is the company's stock price at the time the option is issued, $I _ { \mathrm { 0 } }$ is the value of an equity index for the industry in which the company operates at the time the option is issued, and $I _ { { \boldsymbol { t } } }$ is the value of the index at time $t$ . If the company's performance equals the performance of the industry, the options are always atthe-money. If the company outperforms the industry, the options become in the money. If the company underperforms the industry, the options become out of the money. Note that a relative performance stock option can provide a payoff when both the market and the company's stock price decline.  

Relative performance stock options clearly provide a better way of rewarding senior management for superior performance. Some companies have argued that, if they introduce relative performance options when their competitors do not, they will lose some of their top management talent.  

# 10.22  

Suppose that the closing stock price is $\$ 28$ and an employee has 1,000 options with a strike price of $\$ 24$ . Microsoft’s adjustment involves changing the strike price to $2 4 \times 2 5 / 2 8 = 2 1 . 4 2 8 6$ and changing the number of options to $1 , 0 0 0 { \times } 2 8 / 2 5 = 1 , 1 2 0 .$ . The system used by exchanges would involve keeping the number of options the same and reducing the strike price by $\$ 3$ to $\$ 21$ .  

The Microsoft adjustment is more complicated than that used by the exchange because it requires a knowledge of the Microsoft's stock price immediately before the stock goes exdividend. However, arguably it is a better adjustment than the one used by the exchange. Before the adjustment, the employee has the right to pay $\$ 24,000$ for Microsoft stock that is worth $\$ 28,000$ . After the adjustment, the employee also has the option to pay $\$ 24,000$ for Microsoft stock worth $\$ 28,000$ . Under the adjustment rule used by exchanges, the employee would have the right to buy stock worth $\$ 25,000$ for $\$ 21,000$ . If the volatility of Microsoft remains the same, this is a less valuable option.  

One complication here is that Microsoft's volatility does not remain the same. It can be expected to go up because some cash (a zero risk asset) has been transferred to shareholders. The employees therefore have the same basic option as before but the volatility of Microsoft can be expected to increase. The employees are slightly better off because the value of an option increases with volatility.

Delaying exercise delays the payment of the strike price. This means that the option holder is able to earn interest on the strike price for a longer period of time. Delaying exercise also provides insurance against the stock price falling below the strike price by the expiration date. Assume that the option holder has an amount of cash $K$ and that interest rates are zero. When the option is exercised early it is worth $S _ { T }$ at expiration. Delaying exercise means that it will be worth max $( K , S _ { T } )$ at expiration.  

# 11.4  

An American put when held in conjunction with the underlying stock provides insurance. It guarantees that the stock can be sold for the strike price, $K .$ . If the put is exercised early, the insurance ceases. However, the option holder receives the strike price immediately and is able to earn interest on it between the time of the early exercise and the expiration date.  

# 11.5  

An American call option can be exercised at any time. If it is exercised, its holder gets the intrinsic value. It follows that an American call option must be worth at least its intrinsic value. A European call option can be worth less than its intrinsic value. Consider, for example, the situation where a stock is expected to provide a very high dividend during the life of an option. The price of the stock will decline as a result of the dividend. Because the European option can be exercised only after the dividend has been paid, its value may be less than the intrinsic value today.  

# 11.6  

In this case, $c = 1$ , $T = 0 . 2 5$ , $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 1 9$ , $K = 2 0$ , and $r = 0 . 0 4$ . From put–call parity  

$$
p = c + K e ^ { - r T } - S _ { 0 }
$$  

or  

$$
p = 1 + 2 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 4 \times 0 . 2 5 } - 1 9 = 1 . 8 0
$$  

so that the European put price is $\$ 1.80$ .  

# 11.7  

When early exercise is not possible, we can argue that two portfolios that are worth the same at time $T$ must be worth the same at earlier times. When early exercise is possible, the  

argument is no longer valid. Suppose that $P + S > C + K e ^ { - r T }$ . This situation does not lead to an arbitrage opportunity. If we buy the call, short the put, and short the stock, we cannot be sure of the result because we do not know when the put will be exercised.  

11.8 The lower bound is  

$$
8 0 - 7 5 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 0 . 5 } = \mathbb { S } 8 . 6 6
$$  

11.9 The lower bound is  

$$
6 5 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 2 / 1 2 } - 5 8 = \mathbb { S } 6 . 4 6
$$  

# 11.10  

The present value of the strike price is $6 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 2 \times 4 / 1 2 } = \mathbb { S } 5 7 . 6 5$ . The present value of the dividend is $0 . 8 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 2 \times 1 / 1 2 } = 0 . 7 9$ . Because  

$$
5 < 6 4 - 5 7 . 6 5 - 0 . 7 9
$$  

the condition in equation (11.8) is violated. An arbitrageur should buy the option and short the stock. This generates $6 4 - 5 = \$ 59$ . The arbitrageur invests $\$ 0.79$ of this at $12 \%$ for one month to pay the dividend of $\$ 0.80$ in one month. The remaining $\$ 58.21$ is invested for four months at $12 \%$ . Regardless of what happens a profit will materialize.  

If the stock price declines below $\$ 60$ in four months, the arbitrageur loses the $\$ 5$ spent on the option but gains on the short position. The arbitrageur shorts when the stock price is $\$ 64$ , has to pay dividends with a present value of $\$ 0.79$ , and closes out the short position when the stock price is $\$ 60$ or less. Because $\$ 57.65$ is the present value of $\$ 60$ , the short position generates at least $6 4 - 5 7 . 6 5 - 0 . 7 9 = \mathbb { S } 5 . 5 6$ in present value terms. The present value of the arbitrageur’s gain is therefore at least $5 . 5 6 - 5 . 0 0 = \mathbb { S } 0 . 5 6$ .  

If the stock price is above $\$ 60$ at the expiration of the option, the option is exercised. The arbitrageur buys the stock for $\$ 60$ in four months and closes out the short position. The present value of the $\$ 60$ paid for the stock is $\$ 57.65$ and as before the dividend has a present value of $\$ 0.79$ . The gain from the short position and the exercise of the option is therefore exactly $6 4 - 5 7 . 6 5 - 0 . 7 9 = \mathbb { S } 5 . 5 6$ . The arbitrageur’s gain in present value terms is exactly $5 . 5 6 - 5 . 0 0 = \mathbb { S } 0 . 5 6$ .  

# 11.11  

In this case, the present value of the strike price is $5 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 \times 1 / 1 2 } = 4 9 . 7 5$ . Because  

$$
2 . 5 < 4 9 . 7 5 - 4 7 . 0 0
$$  

the condition in equation (11.5) is violated. An arbitrageur should borrow $\$ 49.50$ at $6 \%$ for one month, buy the stock, and buy the put option. This generates a profit in all circumstances. If the stock price is above $\$ 50$ in one month, the option expires worthless, but the stock can be sold for at least $\$ 50$ . A sum of $\$ 50$ received in one month has a present value of $\$ 49.75$ today. The strategy therefore generates profit with a present value of at least $\$ 0.25$ . If the stock price is below $\$ 50$ in one month the put option is exercised and the stock owned is sold for exactly $\$ 50$ (or $\$ 49.75$ in present value terms). The trading strategy therefore generates a profit of exactly \$0.25 in present value terms.  

# 11.12  

The early exercise of an American put is attractive when the interest earned on the strike price is greater than the insurance element lost. When interest rates increase, the value of the interest earned on the strike price increases making early exercise more attractive. When  

volatility decreases, the insurance element is less valuable. Again this makes early exercise more attractive.  

11.13 Using the notation in the chapter, put−call parity [equation (11.10)] gives  

$$
c + K e ^ { - r T } + D = p + S _ { 0 }
$$  

or  

$$
p = c + K e ^ { - r T } + D - S _ { 0 }
$$  

In this case  

$$
p = 2 + 3 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 6 / 1 2 } + ( 0 . 5 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 2 / 1 2 } + 0 . 5 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 5 / 1 2 } ) - 2 9 = 2 . 5 1
$$  

In other words, the put price is $\$ 2.51$ .  

# 11.14  

If the put price is $\$ 3.00$ , it is too high relative to the call price. An arbitrageur should buy the call, short the put and short the stock. This generates $- 2 + 3 + 2 9 = \$ 30$ in cash which is invested at $10 \%$ . Regardless of what happens a profit with a present value of $3 . 0 0 - 2 . 5 1 = \mathbb { S } 0 . 4 9$ is locked in.  

If the stock price is above $\$ 30$ in six months, the call option is exercised, and the put option expires worthless. The call option enables the stock to be bought for $\$ 30$ , or $3 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 0 \times 6 / 1 2 } = \mathbb { S } 2 8 . 5 4$ in present value terms. The dividends on the short position cost $0 . 5 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 2 / 1 2 } + 0 . 5 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 5 / 1 2 } = \ S 0 . 9 7$ in present value terms so that there is a profit with a present value of $3 0 - 2 8 . 5 4 - 0 . 9 7 = \mathbb { S } 0 . 4 9$ .  

If the stock price is below $\$ 30$ in six months, the put option is exercised and the call option expires worthless. The short put option leads to the stock being bought for $\$ 30$ , or $3 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 0 \times 6 / 1 2 } = \ S 2 8 . 5 4$ in present value terms. The dividends on the short position cost $0 . 5 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 2 / 1 2 } + 0 . 5 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 5 / 1 2 } = \ S 0 . 9 7$ in present value terms so that there is a profit with a present value of $3 0 - 2 8 . 5 4 - 0 . 9 7 = \mathbb { S } 0 . 4 9$ .  

# 11.15  

From equation (11.7)  

$$
S _ { 0 } - K \le C - P \le S _ { 0 } - K e ^ { - r T }
$$  

In this case,  

$$
3 1 - 3 0 \leq 4 - P \leq 3 1 - 3 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 8 \times 0 . 2 5 }
$$  

or  

$$
1 . 0 0 \leq 4 . 0 0 - P \leq 1 . 5 9
$$  

or  

$$
2 . 4 1 \leq P \leq 3 . 0 0
$$  

Upper and lower bounds for the price of an American put are therefore $\$ 2.41$ and $\$ 3.00$ .  

# 11.16  

If the American put price is greater than $\$ 3.00$ , an arbitrageur can sell the American put, short the stock, and buy the American call. This realizes at least $3 + 3 1 - 4 = \mathbb { S } 3 0$ which can be invested at the risk-free interest rate. At some stage during the 3-month period either the American put or the American call will be exercised. The arbitrageur then pays $\$ 30$ , receives the stock and closes out the short position. The cash flows to the arbitrageur are $+ \$ 30$ at time zero and $- \$ 30$ at some future time. These cash flows have a positive present value.  

# 11.17  

As in the text, we use $c$ and $p$ to denote the European call and put option price, and $C$ and $P$ to denote the American call and put option prices. Because $P \geq p$ , it follows from put–call parity that  

and since $c = C _ { \mathrm { { i } } }$ ,  

or  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { P \geq c + K e ^ { - r T } - S _ { 0 } } \\ & { } \\ & { P \geq C + K e ^ { - r T } - S _ { 0 } } \\ & { } \\ & { C - P \leq S _ { 0 } - K e ^ { - r T } } \end{array}
$$  

For a further relationship between $C$ and $P$ , consider  

Portfolio I:  One European call option plus an amount of cash equal to $K$ .  

Portfolio J:  One American put option plus one share.  

Both options have the same exercise price and expiration date. Assume that the cash in portfolio I is invested at the risk-free interest rate. If the put option is not exercised early, portfolio J is worth  

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } { ( S _ { T } , K ) }
$$  

at time $T$ . Portfolio I is worth  

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } { ( S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } - K , 0 ) + K e ^ { r T } } = \operatorname* { m a x } { ( S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } , K ) - K + K e ^ { r T } }
$$  

at this time. Portfolio I is therefore worth more than portfolio J. Suppose next that the put option in portfolio J is exercised early, say, at time $\tau$ . This means that portfolio J is worth $K$ at time $\tau$ . However, even if the call option were worthless, portfolio I would be worth $K e ^ { r \tau }$ at time $\tau$ . It follows that portfolio I is worth at least as much as portfolio J in all circumstances. Hence  

$$
c + K \geq P + S _ { 0 }
$$  

Since $c = C _ { \mathrm { { i } } }$ ,  

$$
C + K \geq P + S _ { 0 }
$$  

or  

$$
C - P { \geq } S _ { 0 } - K
$$  

Combining this with the other inequality derived above for $C - P$ , we obtain  

$$
S _ { 0 } - K \le C - P \le S _ { 0 } - K e ^ { - r T }
$$  

# 11.18  

As in the text, we use $c$ and $p$ to denote the European call and put option price, and $C$ and $P$ to denote the American call and put option prices. The present value of the dividends will be denoted by $D$ . As shown in the answer to Problem 11.24, when there are no dividends  

$$
C - P \le S _ { 0 } - K e ^ { - r T }
$$  

Dividends reduce $C$ and increase $P$ . Hence this relationship must also be true when there are dividends.  

For a further relationship between $C$ and $P$ , consider  

Portfolio I:  One European call option plus an amount of cash equal to $D + K$  

Portfolio J: One American put option plus one share.  

Both options have the same exercise price and expiration date. Assume that the cash in portfolio I is invested at the risk-free interest rate. If the put option is not exercised early, portfolio J is worth  

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } { ( S _ { T } , K ) } + D e ^ { r T }
$$  

at time $T$ . Portfolio I is worth  

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } { ( S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } - K , 0 ) } + ( D + K ) e ^ { r T } = \operatorname* { m a x } { ( S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } , K ) } + D e ^ { r T } + K e ^ { r T } - K
$$  

at this time. Portfolio I is therefore worth more than portfolio J. Suppose next that the put option in portfolio J is exercised early, say, at time $\tau$ . This means that portfolio J is worth at most $K + D e ^ { r \tau }$ at time $\tau$ . However, even if the call option were worthless, portfolio I would be worth $( D + K ) e ^ { r \tau }$ at time $\tau$ . It follows that portfolio I is worth more than portfolio J in all circumstances. Hence  

Because $C \geq c$  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { c + D + K \geq P + S _ { 0 } } } \\ { { } } \\ { { C - P \geq S _ { 0 } - D - K } } \end{array}
$$  

# 11.19  

An employee stock option may be exercised early because the employee needs cash or because he or she is uncertain about the company's future prospects. Regular call options can be sold in the market in either of these two situations, but employee stock options cannot be sold. In theory, an employee can short the company's stock as an alternative to exercising. In practice, this is not usually encouraged and may even be illegal for senior managers. These points are discussed further in Chapter 16.  

# 11.20  

The graphs can be produced from the first worksheet in DerivaGem. Select Equity as the Underlying Type. Select Black−Scholes−European as the Option Type. Input stock price as 50, volatility as $30 \%$ , risk-free rate as $5 \%$ , time to exercise as 1 year, and exercise price as 50. Leave the dividend table blank because we are assuming no dividends. Select the button corresponding to call. Do not select the implied volatility button. Hit the Enter key and click on calculate. DerivaGem will show the price of the option as 7.15562248. Move to the Graph Results on the right hand side of the worksheet. Enter Option Price for the vertical axis and Asset price for the horizontal axis. Choose the minimum strike price value as 10 (software will not accept 0) and the maximum strike price value as 100. Hit Enter and click on Draw Graph. This will produce Figure 11.1a. Figures 11.1c, 11.1e, 11.2a, and 11.2c can be produced similarly by changing the horizontal axis. By selecting put instead of call and recalculating the rest of the figures can be produced. You are encouraged to experiment with this worksheet. Try different parameter values and different types of options.  

# 11.21  

a) The put−call parity result still holds. The arguments are unchanged.   
b) Deep-in-the-money American calls might be exercised early because option holder will prefer to pay the strike price earlier.   
c) Deep-in the-money American puts should not be exercised early because the holder would rather delay receiving the strike price.  

# 11.22  

Because no dividends are paid, the call can be regarded as a European call. Put−call parity can be used to create a European put from the call. A European put plus the stock equals a European call plus the present value of the strike price when both the call and the put have the same strike price and maturity date. A European put can be created by buying the call, shorting the stock, and keeping an amount of cash that when invested at the risk-free rate will grow to be sufficient to exercise the call. If the stock price is above the strike price, the call is exercised and the short position is closed out for no net payoff. If the stock price is below the strike price, the call is not exercised and the short position is closed out for a gain equal to the put payoff.  

# 11.23  

From put−call parity $2 0 + 1 2 0 e ^ { - r \times 1 } = 5 + 1 3 0$   
Solving this $e ^ { - r } = 1 1 5 / 1 2 0$   
so that $r = - \ln ( 1 1 5 / 1 2 0 ) = 0 . 0 4 2 6$ or $4 . 2 6 \%$  

# 11.24  

If the call is worth $\$ 3$ , put−call parity shows that the put should be worth  

$$
3 + 2 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 0 \times 3 / 1 2 } + e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 1 / 1 2 } - 1 9 = 4 . 5 0
$$  

This is greater than $\$ 3$ . The put is therefore undervalued relative to the call. The correct arbitrage strategy is to buy the put, buy the stock, and short the call. This costs $\$ 19$ . If the stock price in three months is greater than $\$ 20$ , the call is exercised. If it is less than $\$ 20$ , the put is exercised. In either case, the arbitrageur sells the stock for $\$ 20$ and collects the $\$ 1$ dividend in one month. The present value of the gain to the arbitrageur is  

$$
- 3 - 1 9 + 3 + 2 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 0 \times 3 / 1 2 } + e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 1 / 1 2 } = 1 . 5 0
$$  

# 11.25  

Consider a portfolio that is long one option with strike price $K _ { \mathfrak { i } }$ , long one option with strike price $K _ { 3 }$ , and short two options with strike price $K _ { \scriptscriptstyle 2 }$ . The value of the portfolio can be worked out in four different situations:  

$S _ { T } \leq K _ { 1 }$  Portfolio Value $= 0$   
$K _ { 1 } < S _ { T } \le K _ { 2 } : \mathrm { { P o r t f o l i o } \ V a l u e } = S _ { T } - K _ { 1 }$   
$K _ { 2 } < S _ { T } \leq K _ { 3 }$  Portfolio Value $= S _ { _ { T } } - K _ { _ { 1 } } - 2 ( S _ { _ { T } } - K _ { _ { 2 } } ) = K _ { _ { 2 } } - K _ { _ { 1 } } - ( S _ { _ { T } } - K _ { _ { 2 } } ) \ = 0 \ _ { }$   
$S _ { T } > K _ { 3 }$  Portfolio Value $= S _ { _ { T } } - K _ { _ { 1 } } - 2 ( S _ { _ { T } } - K _ { _ { 2 } } ) + S _ { _ { T } } - K _ { _ { 3 } } = K _ { _ { 2 } } - K _ { _ { 1 } } - ( K _ { _ { 3 } } - K _ { _ { 2 } } ) = 0$  

The value is always either positive or zero at the expiration of the option. In the absence of arbitrage possibilities, it must be positive or zero today. This means that  

$$
c _ { 1 } + c _ { 3 } - 2 c _ { 2 } \geq 0
$$  

or  

$$
c _ { 2 } \leq 0 . 5 ( c _ { 1 } + c _ { 3 } )
$$  

Note that students often think they have proved this by writing down  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { c _ { 1 } \leq S _ { 0 } - K _ { 1 } e ^ { - r T } } \\ { 2 c _ { 2 } \leq 2 ( S _ { 0 } - K _ { 2 } e ^ { - r T } ) } \\ { c _ { 3 } \leq S _ { 0 } - K _ { 3 } e ^ { - r T } } \end{array}
$$  

and subtracting the middle inequality from the sum of the other two. But they are deceiving themselves. Inequality relationships cannot be subtracted. For example, $9 > 8$ and $5 > 2$ , but it is not true that $9 - 5 > 8 - 2$ !  

# 11.26  

The corresponding result is  

$$
p _ { 2 } \leq 0 . 5 ( p _ { 1 } + p _ { 3 } )
$$  

where ${ p } _ { 1 } , { p } _ { 2 }$ and ${ p } _ { 3 }$ are the prices of European put option with the same maturities and strike prices $K _ { 1 } , K _ { 2 }$ and $K _ { 3 }$ , respectively. This can be proved from the result in Problem 11.25 using put−call parity. Alternatively, we can consider a portfolio consisting of a long position in a put option with strike price $K _ { \mathfrak { i } }$ , a long position in a put option with strike price $K _ { 3 }$ , and a short position in two put options with strike price $K _ { \scriptscriptstyle 2 }$ . The value of this portfolio in different situations is given as follows:  

$S _ { T } \leq K _ { 1 }$  Portfolio V ${ \begin{array} { r l } & { = K _ { 1 } - S _ { T } - 2 ( K _ { 2 } - S _ { T } ) + K _ { 3 } - S _ { T } = K _ { 3 } - K _ { 2 } - ( K _ { 2 } - K _ { 1 } ) = 0 } \\ & { { \mathrm { ~ v a l u e ~ } } = K _ { 3 } - S _ { T } - 2 ( K _ { 2 } - S _ { T } ) = K _ { 3 } - K _ { 2 } - ( K _ { 2 } - S _ { T } ) \geq 0 } \end{array} }$ $\begin{array} { r l } & { \dot { K _ { 1 } } < \dot { S _ { T } } \leq K _ { 2 } : \mathrm { ~ P o r t f o l i o ~ V a l u e } = \dot { K _ { 3 } } - \dot { S _ { T } } ^ { \sim } - 2 ( \dot { K _ { 2 } } - \dot { S _ { T } } ) = \dot { K _ { 3 } } - \dot { K _ { 2 } } - ( \dot { K _ { 2 } } - \dot { S _ { T } } ) \geq 0 } \\ & { \dot { K _ { 2 } } < S _ { T } \leq K _ { 3 } : \mathrm { ~ P o r t f o l i o ~ V a l u e } = K _ { 3 } - { S _ { T } } } \\ & { \dot { S _ { T } } > K _ { 3 } : \mathrm { ~ P o r t f o l i o ~ V a l u e } = 0 } \end{array}$  

Because the portfolio value is always zero or positive at some future time the same must be true today. Hence,  

or  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { p _ { 1 } + p _ { 3 } - 2 p _ { 2 } \geq 0 } } \\ { { { } } } \\ { { p _ { 2 } \leq 0 . 5 ( p _ { 1 } + p _ { 3 } ) } } \end{array}
$$  

# CHAPTER 12 Trading Strategies Involving Options  

# Practice Questions  

# 12.1  

An investor can create a butterfly spread by buying call options with strike prices of $\$ 15$ and $\$ 20$ and selling two call options with strike prices of $\$ 17frac\scriptscriptstyle { 1}$ . The initial investment is $4 + 0 . 5 - 2 \times 2 = \ S 0 . 5 .$ . The following table shows the variation of profit with the final stock price:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Stock Price, ST</td><td>Profit</td></tr><tr><td>S <15</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15<S, <17½</td><td>(S,-15)-↓</td></tr><tr><td>17↓<Sτ<20</td><td>(20-Sr)-</td></tr><tr><td>Sr >20</td><td>-</td></tr></table></body></html>  

12.2 A strangle is created by buying both options. The pattern of profits is as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>StockPrice, ST</td><td>Profit</td></tr><tr><td>Sr<45</td><td>(45-Sr)-5</td></tr><tr><td>45<Sτ <50</td><td>-5</td></tr><tr><td>Sr >50</td><td>(ST -50)-5</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# 12.3  

A bull spread using calls provides a profit pattern with the same general shape as a bull spread using puts (see Figures 12.2 and 12.3 in the text). Define $p _ { 1 }$ and $c _ { 1 }$ as the prices of put and call with strike price $K _ { \mathfrak { i } }$ and ${ { p } _ { 2 } }$ and $c _ { 2 }$ as the prices of a put and call with strike price $K _ { \scriptscriptstyle 2 }$ . From put−call parity  

$$
p _ { 1 } + S = c _ { 1 } + K _ { 1 } e ^ { - r T }
$$  

$$
p _ { 2 } + S = c _ { 2 } + K _ { 2 } e ^ { - r T }
$$  

Hence,  

$$
p _ { 1 } - p _ { 2 } = c _ { 1 } - c _ { 2 } - ( K _ { 2 } - K _ { 1 } ) e ^ { - r T }
$$  

This shows that the initial investment when the spread is created from puts is less than the initial investment when it is created from calls by an amount $( K _ { 2 } - K _ { 1 } ) e ^ { - r T }$ . In fact, as mentioned in the text, the initial investment when the bull spread is created from puts is  

negative, while the initial investment when it is created from calls is positive.  

The profit when calls are used to create the bull spread is higher than when puts are used by $( K _ { 2 } - K _ { 1 } ) ( 1 - e ^ { - r T } )$ . This reflects the fact that the call strategy involves an additional risk-free investment of $( K _ { 2 } - K _ { 1 } ) e ^ { - r T }$ over the put strategy. This earns interest of  

$$
( K _ { 2 } - K _ { 1 } ) e ^ { - r T } ( e ^ { r T } - 1 ) = ( K _ { 2 } - K _ { 1 } ) ( 1 - e ^ { - r T } ) .
$$  

# 12.4  

An aggressive bull spread using call options is discussed in the text. Both of the options used have relatively high strike prices. Similarly, an aggressive bear spread can be created using put options. Both of the options should be out of the money (i.e., they should have relatively low strike prices). The spread then costs very little to set up because both of the puts are worth close to zero. In most circumstances, the spread will provide zero payoff. However, there is a small chance that the stock price will fall fast so that on expiration both options will be in the money. The spread then provides a payoff equal to the difference between the two strike prices, $K _ { 2 } - K _ { 1 }$ .  

# 12.5  

A bull spread is created by buying the $\$ 30$ put and selling the $\$ 35$ put. This strategy gives rise to an initial cash inflow of $\$ 3$ . The outcome is as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Stock Price</td><td>Payoff</td><td>Profit</td></tr><tr><td>Sr ≥35</td><td>0</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>30≤Sτ <35</td><td>S-35</td><td>Sr-32</td></tr><tr><td>S<30</td><td>-5</td><td>-2</td></tr></table></body></html>  

A bear spread is created by selling the $\$ 30$ put and buying the $\$ 35$ put. This strategy costs $\$ 3$ initially. The outcome is as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Stock Price</td><td>Payoff</td><td>Profit</td></tr><tr><td>S≥35</td><td>0</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td>30≤Sτ <35</td><td>35-Sr</td><td>32-ST</td></tr><tr><td>ST<30</td><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# 12.6  

Define $c _ { 1 } , c _ { 2 }$ , and $c _ { 3 }$ as the prices of calls with strike prices $K _ { 1 } , K _ { 2 }$ and $K _ { 3 }$ . Define ${ \boldsymbol { p } } _ { 1 } , { \boldsymbol { p } } _ { 2 }$ and ${ p } _ { 3 }$ as the prices of puts with strike prices $K _ { 1 } , K _ { 2 }$ and $K _ { 3 }$ . With the usual notation  

$$
c _ { 1 } + K _ { 1 } e ^ { - r T } = p _ { 1 } + S
$$  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { c _ { 2 } + K _ { 2 } e ^ { - r T } = p _ { 2 } + S } } \\ { { { } } } \\ { { c _ { 3 } + K _ { 3 } e ^ { - r T } = p _ { 3 } + S } } \end{array}
$$  

Hence,  

$$
c _ { 1 } + c _ { 3 } - 2 c _ { 2 } + ( K _ { 1 } + K _ { 3 } - 2 K _ { 2 } ) e ^ { - r T } = p _ { 1 } + p _ { 3 } - 2 p _ { 2 }
$$  

Because $K _ { _ 2 } - K _ { 1 } = K _ { _ 3 } - K _ { _ 2 }$ , it follows that $K _ { _ 1 } + K _ { _ 3 } - 2 K _ { _ 2 } = 0$ and  

$$
c _ { 1 } + c _ { 3 } - 2 c _ { 2 } = p _ { 1 } + p _ { 3 } - 2 p _ { 2 }
$$  

The cost of a butterfly spread created using European calls is therefore exactly the same as the cost of a butterfly spread created using European puts.  

12.7 A straddle is created by buying both the call and the put. This strategy costs $\$ 10$ . The profit/loss is shown in the following table:   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Stock Price</td><td>Payoff</td><td>Profit</td></tr><tr><td>Sr >60</td><td>S,-60</td><td>S,-70</td></tr><tr><td>ST ≤60</td><td>60-ST</td><td>50-ST</td></tr></table></body></html>  

This shows that the straddle will lead to a loss if the final stock price is between $\$ 50$ and $\$ 70$ .  

# 12.8  

The bull spread is created by buying a put with strike price $K _ { \mathfrak { i } }$ and selling a put with strike price $K _ { \scriptscriptstyle 2 }$ . The payoff is calculated as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Stock Price</td><td>Payoff from Long Put</td><td>Payoff from Short Put</td><td>Total Payoff</td></tr><tr><td>Sr≥K</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>K <ST <K2</td><td>0</td><td>S-K</td><td>-(K-Sr)</td></tr><tr><td>S≤K</td><td>K-ST</td><td>S-K</td><td>-(K-K)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

12.9 Possible strategies are:  

Strangle   
Straddle   
Strip   
Strap   
Reverse calendar spread   
Reverse butterfly spread  

The strategies all provide positive profits when there are large stock price moves. A strangle is less expensive than a straddle, but requires a bigger move in the stock price in order to provide a positive profit. Strips and straps are more expensive than straddles but provide bigger profits in certain circumstances. A strip will provide a bigger profit when there is a large downward stock price move. A strap will provide a bigger profit when there is a large upward stock price move. In the case of strangles, straddles, strips and straps, the profit increases as the size of the stock price movement increases. By contrast, in a reverse calendar spread and a reverse butterfly spread, there is a maximum potential profit regardless of the size of the stock price movement.  

# 12.10  

Suppose that the delivery price is $K$ and the delivery date is $T$ . The forward contract is created by buying a European call and selling a European put when both options have strike price $K$ and exercise date $T$ . This portfolio provides a payoff of $S _ { \sc } - K$ under all circumstances where $S _ { T }$ is the stock price at time $T$ . Suppose that $F _ { 0 }$ is the forward price. If $K = F _ { 0 }$ , the forward contract that is created has zero value. This shows that the price of a call equals the price of a put when the strike price is $F _ { 0 }$ .

A box spread is a bull spread created using calls together with a bear spread created using puts. With the notation in the text, it consists of a) a long call with strike $K _ { 1 } , \mathfrak { b } )$ a short call with strike $K _ { \mathfrak { z } } , { \mathfrak { c } } )$ a long put with strike $K _ { \scriptscriptstyle 2 }$ , and d) a short put with strike $K _ { \mathfrak { i } }$ . a) and d) give a long forward contract with delivery price $K _ { 1 } ; { \mathfrak { b } } )$ and c) give a short forward contract with delivery price $K _ { \scriptscriptstyle 2 }$ . The two forward contracts taken together give the payoff of $K _ { 2 } - K _ { 1 }$ .  

# 12.12  

The result is shown in Figure S12.1. The profit pattern from a long position in a call and a put when the put has a higher strike price than a call is much the same as when the call has a higher strike price than the put. Both the initial investment and the final payoff are much higher in the first case

To use DerivaGem, select the first worksheet and choose Currency as the Underlying Type. Select Black−Scholes European as the Option Type. Input exchange rate as 0.64, volatility as $1 5 \%$ , risk-free rate as $5 \%$ , foreign risk-free interest rate as $4 \%$ , time to exercise as 1 year, and exercise price as 0.60. Select the button corresponding to call. Do not select the implied volatility button. Hit the Enter key and click on calculate. DerivaGem will show the price of the option as 0.0618. Change the exercise price to 0.65, hit Enter, and click on calculate again. DerivaGem will show the value of the option as 0.0352. Change the exercise price to 0.70, hit Enter, and click on calculate. DerivaGem will show the value of the option as 0.0181.  

Now select the button corresponding to put and repeat the procedure. DerivaGem shows the values of puts with strike prices 0.60, 0.65, and 0.70 to be 0.0176, 0.0386, and 0.0690, respectively.  

The cost of setting up the butterfly spread when calls are used is therefore $0 . 0 6 1 8 + 0 . 0 1 8 1 - 2 \times 0 . 0 3 5 2 = 0 . 0 0 9 5$  

The cost of setting up the butterfly spread when puts are used is $0 . 0 1 7 6 + 0 . 0 6 9 0 - 2 \times 0 . 0 3 8 6 = 0 . 0 0 9 4$  

Allowing for rounding errors, these two are the same.  

# 12.14  

Assume that the investment in the index is initially $\$ 100$ . (This is a scaling factor that makes no difference to the result.) DerivaGem can be used to value an option on the index with the index level equal to 100, the volatility equal to $20 \%$ , the risk-free rate equal to $4 \%$ , the dividend yield equal to $1 \%$ , and the exercise price equal to 100. For different times to maturity, $T ,$ we value a call option (using Black−Scholes European) and the amount available to buy the call option, which is $1 0 0 - 1 0 0 \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 4 \times T } .$ Results are as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Time to maturity, T</td><td>Funds Available</td><td>Value of Option</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>3.92</td><td>9.32</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>7.69</td><td>13.79</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>18.13</td><td>23.14</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>32.97</td><td>33.34</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>35.60</td><td>34.91</td></tr></table></body></html>  

This table shows that the answer is between 10 and 11 years. Continuing the calculations, we find that if the life of the principal-protected note is 10.35 year or more, it is profitable for the bank.   (Excel's Solver can be used in conjunction with the DerivaGem functions to facilitate calculations.)  

# 12.15  

If volatility is zero, the option to purchase the stock portfolio for $\$ 1,000$ when there are no dividends is worth 1,000 minus the present value of 1,000 $\mathrm { \Phi } ( = \$ 164.73$ in the example).  When volatility is greater than zero (as it is in practice), the option is worth more than this. The $\$ 164.73$ that the provider of the principal protected note has available to purchase an option is therefore not enough.  

# 12.16  

The initial investment is $\$ 2.60$ . The total payoff is (a) \$4, (b) $\$ 1$ , and (c) 0.  

# 12.17  

The trader makes a profit if the total payoff is less than $\$ 7$ . This happens when the price of the asset is between $\$ 33$ and $\$ 57$ .  

# 12.18  

A butterfly spread is created by buying the $\$ 55$ put, buying the $\$ 65$ put and selling two of the $\$ 60$ puts. This costs $3 + 8 - 2 \times 5 = 8 1$ initially. The following table shows the profit/loss from the strategy.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Stock Price</td><td>Payoff</td><td>Profit</td></tr><tr><td>Sr ≥65</td><td>0</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>60≤ Sτ <65</td><td>65-ST</td><td>64-Sr</td></tr><tr><td>55≤Sτ<60</td><td>S,-55</td><td>S.-56</td></tr><tr><td>S<55</td><td>0</td><td>-1</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The butterfly spread leads to a loss when the final stock price is greater than $\$ 64$ or less than $\$ 56$ .  

# 12.19  

There are two alternative profit patterns for part (a). These are shown in Figures S12.2 and S12.3. In Figure S12.2, the long maturity (high strike price) option is worth more than the short maturity (low strike price) option. In Figure S12.3, the reverse is true. There is no ambiguity about the profit pattern for part (b). This is shown in Figure S12.4.

Figure S12.5 Answer to Problem 12.20  

12.21  

(a) A call option with a strike price of 25 costs 7.90 and a call option with a strike price of 30 costs 4.18. The cost of the bull spread is therefore $7 . 9 0 - 4 . 1 8 = 3 . 7 2$ . The profits ignoring the impact of discounting are as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Stock Price Range</td><td>Profit</td></tr><tr><td>Sr≤25</td><td>-3.72</td></tr><tr><td>25<Sτ<30</td><td>Sr -28.72</td></tr><tr><td>ST≥30</td><td>1.28</td></tr></table></body></html>  

(b) A put option with a strike price of 25 costs 0.28 and a put option with a strike price of 30 costs 1.44. The cost of the bear spread is therefore $1 . 4 4 - 0 . 2 8 = 1 . 1 6$ . The profits ignoring the impact of discounting are as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Stock Price Range</td><td>Profit</td></tr><tr><td>ST≤25</td><td>+3.84</td></tr><tr><td>25<Sr <30</td><td>28.84-ST</td></tr><tr><td>ST≥30</td><td>-1.16</td></tr></table></body></html>  

(c) Call options with maturities of one year and strike prices of 25, 30, and 35 cost 8.92, 5.60, and 3.28, respectively. The cost of the butterfly spread is therefore $8 . 9 2 + 3 . 2 8 - 2 \times 5 . 6 0 = 1 . 0 0$ . The profits ignoring the impact of discounting are as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Stock Price Range</td><td>Profit</td></tr><tr><td>Sr≤25</td><td>-1.00</td></tr><tr><td>25<Sr<30</td><td>Sr -26.00</td></tr><tr><td>30≤Sτ <35</td><td>34.00-ST</td></tr></table></body></html>  

(d) Put options with maturities of one year and strike prices of 25, 30, and 35 cost 0.70, 2.14, 4.57, respectively. The cost of the butterfly spread is therefore $0 . 7 0 + 4 . 5 7 - 2 \times 2 . 1 4 = 0 . 9 9$ . Allowing for rounding errors, this is the same as in (c). The profits are the same as in (c).  

(e) A call option with a strike price of 30 costs 4.18. A put option with a strike price of 30 costs 1.44. The cost of the straddle is therefore $4 . 1 8 + 1 . 4 4 = 5 . 6 2$ . The profits ignoring the impact of discounting are as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Stock Price Range</td><td>Profit</td></tr><tr><td>S≤30</td><td>24.38 - ST</td></tr><tr><td>Sr >30</td><td>Sr -35.62</td></tr></table></body></html>  

(f) A six-month call option with a strike price of 35 costs 1.85. A six-month put option with a strike price of 25 costs 0.28. The cost of the strangle is therefore $1 . 8 5 + 0 . 2 8 = 2 . 1 3$ . The profits ignoring the impact of discounting are as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Stock Price Range</td><td>Profit</td></tr><tr><td>Sr ≤25</td><td>22.87-ST</td></tr><tr><td>25<Sτ <35</td><td>-2.13</td></tr><tr><td>S≥35</td><td>Sr -37.13</td></tr></table></body></html>

# Practice Questions  

13.1 In this case, $u = 1 . 1 0$ , $d = 0 . 9 0$ , $\Delta t = 0 . 5$ , and $r = 0 . 0 8$ , so that  

$$
p = \frac { e ^ { 0 . 0 8 \times 0 . 5 } - 0 . 9 0 } { 1 . 1 0 - 0 . 9 0 } = 0 . 7 0 4 1
$$  

The tree for stock price movements is shown in Figure S13.1. We can work back from the end of the tree to the beginning, as indicated in the diagram, to give the value of the option as $\$ 9.61$ . The option value can also be calculated directly from equation (13.10):  

$$
[ 0 . 7 0 4 1 ^ { 2 } \times 2 1 + 2 \times 0 . 7 0 4 1 \times 0 . 2 9 5 9 \times 0 + 0 . 2 9 5 9 ^ { 2 } \times 0 ] e ^ { - 2 \times 0 . 0 8 \times 0 . 5 } = 9 . 6 1
$$  

or $\$ 9.61$ .

Figure S13.1:  Tree for Problem 13.1  

# 13.2  

Figure S13.2 shows how we can value the put option using the same tree as in Problem 13.1. The value of the option is $\$ 1.92$ . The option value can also be calculated directly from equation (13.10):  

$$
e ^ { - 2 \times 0 . 0 8 \times 0 . 5 } [ 0 . 7 0 4 1 ^ { 2 } \times 0 + 2 \times 0 . 7 0 4 1 \times 0 . 2 9 5 9 \times 1 + 0 . 2 9 5 9 ^ { 2 } \times 1 9 ] = 1 . 9 2
$$  

or $\$ 1.92$ . The stock price plus the put price is $1 0 0 + 1 . 9 2 = \mathcal { S } 1 0 1 . 9 2$ . The present value of the  

strike price plus the call price is $1 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 8 \times 1 } + 9 . 6 1 = \mathcal { S } 1 0 1 . 9 2$ . These are the same, verifying that put–call parity holds.

Figure S13.2:  Tree for Problem 13.2  

# 13.3  

The riskless portfolio consists of a short position in the option and a long position in $\Delta$ shares. Because $\Delta$ changes during the life of the option, this riskless portfolio must also change.  

# 13.4  

At the end of two months, the value of the option will be either $\$ 4$ (if the stock price is $\$ 53$ ) or $\$ 0$ (if the stock price is $\$ 48$ ). Consider a portfolio consisting of:  

$$
{ \begin{array} { r c l } { + \Delta } & { : } & { { \mathrm { s h a r e s } } } \\ { - 1 } & { : } & { { \mathrm { o p t i o n } } } \end{array} }
$$  

The value of the portfolio is either $4 8 \Delta$ or $5 3 \Delta - 4$ in two months. If $4 8 \Delta = 5 3 \Delta - 4$  

that is,  

$$
\Delta = 0 . 8
$$  

the value of the portfolio is certain to be 38.4. For this value of $\Delta$ , the portfolio is therefore riskless. The current value of the portfolio is:  

$$
0 . 8 { \times } 5 0 { - } f
$$  

where $f$ is the value of the option. Since the portfolio must earn the risk-free rate of interest  

$$
( 0 . 8 { \times } 5 0 - f ) e ^ { 0 . 1 0 { \times } 2 / 1 2 } = 3 8 . 4
$$  

that is  

$$
\scriptstyle f = 2 . 2 3
$$  

The value of the option is therefore $\$ 23$ .  

This can also be calculated directly from equations (13.2) and (13.3). $u = 1 . 0 6$ , $d = 0 . 9 6$ so that  

$$
p = \frac { e ^ { 0 . 1 0 \times 2 / 1 2 } - 0 . 9 6 } { 1 . 0 6 - 0 . 9 6 } = 0 . 5 6 8 1
$$  

and  

$$
f = e ^ { - 0 . 1 0 \times 2 / 1 2 } \times 0 . 5 6 8 1 \times 4 = 2 . 2 3
$$  

# 13.5  

At the end of four months, the value of the option will be either $\$ 5$ (if the stock price is $\$ 75$ ) or $\$ 0$ (if the stock price is $\$ 85$ ). Consider a portfolio consisting of:  

$$
{ \begin{array} { r c l } { - \Delta } & { : } & { { \mathrm { s h a r e s } } } \\ { + 1 } & { : } & { { \mathrm { o p t i o n } } } \end{array} }
$$  

(Note: The delta, $\Delta$ of a put option is negative. We have constructed the portfolio so that it is $+ 1$ option and $- \Delta$ shares rather than $^ { - 1 }$ option and $+ \Delta$ shares so that the initial investment is positive.)  

The value of the portfolio is either $- 8 5 \Delta$ or $- 7 5 \Delta + 5$ in four months. If $- 8 5 \Delta = - 7 5 \Delta + 5$  

that is  

$$
\Delta = - 0 . 5
$$  

the value of the portfolio is certain to be 42.5. For this value of $\Delta$ the portfolio is therefore riskless. The current value of the portfolio is:  

$$
0 . 5 { \times } 8 0 { + } f
$$  

where $f$ is the value of the option. Since the portfolio is riskless  

$$
( 0 . 5 { \times } 8 0 + f ) e ^ { 0 . 0 5 { \times } 4 / 1 2 } = 4 2 . 5
$$  

that is  

$$
f = 1 . 8 0
$$  

The value of the option is therefore $\$ 1.80$ .  

This can also be calculated directly from equations (13.2) and (13.3). $u = 1 . 0 6 2 5$ , $d = 0 . 9 3 7 5$ so that  

$$
p = { \frac { e ^ { 0 . 0 5 \times 4 / 1 2 } - 0 . 9 3 7 5 } { 1 . 0 6 2 5 - 0 . 9 3 7 5 } } = 0 . 6 3 4 5
$$  

$1 - p = 0 . 3 6 5 5$ and  

$$
f = e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 4 / 1 2 } \times 0 . 3 6 5 5 \times 5 = 1 . 8 0
$$  

# 13.6  

At the end of three months the value of the option is either $\$ 5$ (if the stock price is $\$ 35$ ) or $\$ 0$ (if the stock price is $\$ 45$ ).  

Consider a portfolio consisting of:  

$$
{ \begin{array} { r c l } { - \Delta } & { : } & { { \mathrm { s h a r e s } } } \\ { + 1 } & { : } & { { \mathrm { o p t i o n } } } \end{array} }
$$  

(Note: The delta, $\Delta$ , of a put option is negative. We have constructed the portfolio so that it is $+ 1$ option and $- \Delta$ shares rather than $^ { - 1 }$ option and $+ \Delta$ shares so that the initial investment is positive.)  

The value of the portfolio is either $- 3 5 \Delta + 5$ or $- 4 5 \Delta$ . If: $- 3 5 \Delta + 5 = - 4 5 \Delta$  

that is,  

$$
\Delta = - 0 . 5
$$  

the value of the portfolio is certain to be 22.5. For this value of $\Delta$ , the portfolio is therefore riskless. The current value of the portfolio is  

$$
- 4 0 \Delta + f
$$  

where $f$ is the value of the option. Since the portfolio must earn the risk-free rate of interest $( 4 0 \times 0 . 5 + f ) \times 1 . 0 2 = 2 2 . 5$  

Hence,  

$$
f = 2 . 0 6
$$  

i.e., the value of the option is $\$ 2.06$ .  

This can also be calculated using risk-neutral valuation. Suppose that $p$ is the probability of an upward stock price movement in a risk-neutral world. We must have  

$$
4 5 p + 3 5 ( 1 - p ) = 4 0 \times 1 . 0 2
$$  

that is  

$$
1 0 p = 5 . 8
$$  

Or,  

$$
p { = } 0 . 5 8
$$  

The expected value of the option in a risk-neutral world is:  

$$
0 \times 0 . 5 8 + 5 \times 0 . 4 2 = 2 . 1 0
$$  

This has a present value of  

$$
\frac { 2 . 1 0 } { 1 . 0 2 } = 2 . 0 6
$$  

This is consistent with the no-arbitrage answer.  

# 13.7  

A tree describing the behavior of the stock price is shown in Figure S13.3. The risk-neutral probability of an up move, $p$ , is given by  

$$
p = { \frac { e ^ { 0 . 0 5 \times 3 / 1 2 } - 0 . 9 5 } { 1 . 0 6 - 0 . 9 5 } } = 0 . 5 6 8 9
$$  

There is a payoff from the option of $5 6 . 1 8 - 5 1 = 5 . 1 8$ for the highest final node (which corresponds to two up moves) zero in all other cases. The value of the option is therefore $5 . 1 8 \times 0 . 5 6 8 9 ^ { 2 } \times e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 6 / 1 2 } = 1 . 6 3 5$  

This can also be calculated by working back through the tree as indicated in Figure S13.3.   
The value of the call option is the lower number at each node in the figure.  

![](images/6c9f3be2d6c7d78930f758cdfc63acbe15585ac967a911cf0e8cc2ed6cdc6079.jpg)  
Figure S13.3:  Tree for Problem 13.7  

# 13.8  

The tree for valuing the put option is shown in Figure S13.4. We get a payoff of $5 1 - 5 0 . 3 5 = 0 . 6 5$ if the middle final node is reached and a payoff of $5 1 - 4 5 . 1 2 5 = 5 . 8 7 5$ if the lowest final node is reached. The value of the option is therefore  

$$
( 0 . 6 5 \times 2 \times 0 . 5 6 8 9 \times 0 . 4 3 1 1 + 5 . 8 7 5 \times 0 . 4 3 1 1 ^ { 2 } ) e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 6 / 1 2 } = 1 . 3 7 6
$$  

This can also be calculated by working back through the tree as indicated in Figure S13.4.  

The value of the put plus the stock price is  

$$
1 . 3 7 6 + 5 0 = 5 1 . 3 7 6
$$  

The value of the call plus the present value of the strike price is  

$$
1 . 6 3 5 + 5 1 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 6 / 1 2 } = 5 1 . 3 7 6
$$  

This verifies that put–call parity holds.  

To test whether it is worth exercising the option early, we compare the value calculated for the option at each node with the payoff from immediate exercise. At node C, the payoff from immediate exercise is $5 1 - 4 7 . 5 = 3 . 5$ . Because this is greater than 2.8664, the option should be exercised at this node. The option should not be exercised at either node A or node B.

Figure S13.4:  Tree for Problem 13.8  

# 13.9  

This problem shows that the valuation procedures introduced in the chapter can be used for derivatives other than call and put options.  

At the end of two months, the value of the derivative will be either 529 (if the stock price is 23) or 729 (if the stock price is 27). Consider a portfolio consisting of:  

$$
\begin{array} { r c l } { { + \Delta } } & { { : } } & { { \mathrm { s h a r e s } } } \\ { { - 1 } } & { { : } } & { { \mathrm { d e r i v a t i v e } } } \end{array}
$$  

The value of the portfolio is either $2 7 \Delta - 7 2 9$ or $2 3 \Delta - 5 2 9$ in two months. If $2 7 \Delta - 7 2 9 = 2 3 \Delta - 5 2 9$  

that is,  

$$
\Delta = 5 0
$$  

the value of the portfolio is certain to be 621. For this value of $\Delta$ , the portfolio is therefore riskless. The current value of the portfolio is:  

$$
5 0 \times 2 5 - f
$$  

where $f$ is the value of the derivative. Since the portfolio must earn the risk-free rate of interest  

$$
( 5 0 \times 2 5 - f ) e ^ { 0 . 1 0 \times 2 / 1 2 } = 6 2 1
$$  

that is  

$$
f = 6 3 9 . 3
$$  

The value of the option is therefore $\$ 639.3$ .  

This can also be calculated directly from equations (13.2) and (13.3). $u = 1 . 0 8$ , $d = 0 . 9 2$ so that  

$$
p = \frac { e ^ { 0 . 1 0 \times 2 / 1 2 } - 0 . 9 2 } { 1 . 0 8 - 0 . 9 2 } = 0 . 6 0 5 0
$$  

and  

$$
f = e ^ { - 0 . 1 0 \times 2 / 1 2 } ( 0 . 6 0 5 0 \times 7 2 9 + 0 . 3 9 5 0 \times 5 2 9 ) = 6 3 9 . 3
$$  

# 13.10  

In this case,  

$$
a = e ^ { ( 0 . 0 5 - 0 . 0 8 ) \times 1 / 1 2 } = 0 . 9 9 7 5
$$  

$$
u = e ^ { 0 . 1 2 \sqrt { 1 / 1 2 } } = 1 . 0 3 5 2
$$  

$$
d = 1 / u = 0 . 9 6 6 0
$$  

$$
p = { \frac { 0 . 9 9 7 5 - 0 . 9 6 6 0 } { 1 . 0 3 5 2 - 0 . 9 6 6 0 } } = 0 . 4 5 5 3
$$

The delta for the first period is $1 5 / ( 1 5 8 . 6 4 - 1 2 3 . 5 5 ) = 0 . 4 2 7 3$ . The trader should take a long position in 4,273 shares. If there is an up movement, the delta for the second period is $2 9 . 7 6 / ( 1 7 9 . 7 6 - 1 4 0 ) = 0 . 7 4 8 5$ . The trader should increase the holding to 7,485 shares. If there is a down movement, the trader should decrease the holding to zero.

At the end of six months, the value of the option will be either $\$ 12$ (if the stock price is \$60) or $\$ 0$ (if the stock price is $\$ 42$ ). Consider a portfolio consisting of:  

$$
\begin{array} { c c c } { + \Delta } & { : } & { \mathrm { s h a r e s } } \\ { - 1 } & { : } & { \mathrm { o p t i o n } } \end{array}
$$  

The value of the portfolio is either $4 2 \Delta$ or $6 0 \Delta - 1 2$ in six months. If $4 2 \Delta = 6 0 \Delta - 1 2$  

that is,  

$$
\Delta = 0 . 6 6 6 7
$$  

the value of the portfolio is certain to be 28. For this value of $\Delta$ the portfolio is therefore riskless. The current value of the portfolio is:  

$$
0 . 6 6 6 7 \times 5 0 - f
$$  

where $f$ is the value of the option. Since the portfolio must earn the risk-free rate of interest  

that is,  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { ( 0 . 6 6 6 7 \times 5 0 - f ) e ^ { 0 . 1 2 \times 0 . 5 } = 2 8 } } \\ { { f = 6 . 9 6 } } \end{array}
$$  

The value of the option is therefore $\$ 6.96$ .  

This can also be calculated using risk-neutral valuation. Suppose that $p$ is the probability of  

an upward stock price movement in a risk-neutral world. We must have  

that is,  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { 6 0 p + 4 2 ( 1 - p ) = 5 0 \times e ^ { 0 . 0 6 } } \\ { 1 8 p = 1 1 . 0 9 } \end{array}
$$  

or:  

$$
p = 0 . 6 1 6 1
$$  

The expected value of the option in a risk-neutral world is: $1 2 \times 0 . 6 1 6 1 + 0 \times 0 . 3 8 3 9 = 7 . 3 9 3 2$  

This has a present value of  

$$
7 . 3 9 3 2 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 } = 6 . 9 6
$$  

Hence, the above answer is consistent with risk-neutral valuation.  

# 13.17  

a. A tree describing the behavior of the stock price is shown in Figure S13.9. The riskneutral probability of an up move, $p$ , is given by  

$$
p = { \frac { e ^ { 0 . 1 2 \times 3 / 1 2 } - 0 . 9 0 } { 1 . 1 - 0 . 9 } } = 0 . 6 5 2 3
$$  

Calculating the expected payoff and discounting, we obtain the value of the option as  

$$
[ 2 . 4 \times 2 \times 0 . 6 5 2 3 \times 0 . 3 4 7 7 + 9 . 6 \times 0 . 3 4 7 7 ^ { 2 } ] e ^ { - 0 . 1 2 \times 6 / 1 2 } = 2 . 1 1 8
$$  

The value of the European option is 2.118. This can also be calculated by working back through the tree as shown in Figure S13.9. The second number at each node is the value of the European option.  

b. The value of the American option is shown as the third number at each node on the tree. It is 2.537. This is greater than the value of the European option because it is optimal to exercise early at node C.

# 13.18  

Trial and error shows that immediate early exercise is optimal when the strike price is above 43.2.  This can be also shown to be true algebraically. Suppose the strike price increases by a  

relatively small amount $q$ . This increases the value of being at node $\mathrm { C }$ by $q$ and the value of being at node B by $0 . 3 4 7 7 e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 } q = 0 . 3 3 7 4 q$ . It therefore increases the value of being at node A by  

$$
( 0 . 6 5 2 3 \times 0 . 3 3 7 4 q + 0 . 3 4 7 7 q ) e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 } = 0 . 5 5 1 q
$$  

For early exercise at node A, we require $2 . 5 3 7 + 0 . 5 5 1 q < 2 + q$ or $q > 1 . 1 9 6$ . This corresponds to the strike price being greater than 43.196.  

# 13.19  

(a) This problem is based on the material in Section 13.8. In this case, $\Delta t = 0 . 2 5$ so that $u = e ^ { 0 . 3 0 \times \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } } = 1 . 1 6 1 8$ , $d = 1 / u = 0 . 8 6 0 7$ , and  

$$
p = { \frac { e ^ { 0 . 0 4 \times 0 . 2 5 } - 0 . 8 6 0 7 } { 1 . 1 6 1 8 - 0 . 8 6 0 7 } } = 0 . 4 9 5 9

(b) and (c) The value of the option using a two-step tree is 4.8604.   
(d) With 5, 50, 100, and 500 time steps, the value of the option is 5.6858, 5.3869, 5.3981, and 5.4072, respectively.  

# 13.21  

The value of the put option is  

$$
( 0 . 5 5 0 3 \times 0 + 0 . 4 4 9 7 \times 3 ) \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 4 \times 3 / 1 2 } = 1 . 3 3 5 7
$$  

The expected payoff in the real world is  

$$
( 0 . 6 2 0 6 \times 0 + 0 . 3 7 9 4 \times 3 ) { = } 1 . 1 1 9 9
$$  

The discount rate $R$ that should be used in the real world is therefore given by solving  

The solution to this is $R { = } - 0 . 7 0 4$ . The discount rate is $- 7 0 . 4 \%$ .  

The underlying stock has positive systematic risk because its expected return is higher than the risk free rate. This means that the stock will tend to do well when the market does well. The call option has a high positive systematic risk because it tends to do very well when the market does well. As a result, a high discount rate is appropriate for its expected payoff. The put option is in the opposite position. It tends to provide a high return when the market does badly. As a result, it is appropriate to use a highly negative discount rate for its expected payoff.  

# CHAPTER 14 Wiener Processes and Itô's Lemma  

# Practice Questions  

# 14.1  

The first point to make is that any trading strategy can, just because of good luck, produce above average returns. The key question is whether a trading strategy consistently outperforms the market when adjustments are made for risk. It is certainly possible that a trading strategy could do this. However, when enough investors know about the strategy and trade on the basis of the strategy, the profit will disappear.  

As an illustration of this, consider a phenomenon known as the small firm effect. Portfolios of stocks in small firms appear to have outperformed portfolios of stocks in large firms when appropriate adjustments are made for risk. Research was published about this in the early 1980s and mutual funds were set up to take advantage of the phenomenon. There is some evidence that this has resulted in the phenomenon disappearing.  

# 14.2  

Suppose that the company's initial cash position is $x$ . The probability distribution of the cash position at the end of one year is  

$$
\varphi ( x + 4 \times 0 . 5 , 4 \times 4 ) = \varphi ( x + 2 . 0 , 1 6 )
$$  

where $\varphi ( m , \nu )$ is a normal probability distribution with mean $m$ and variance $\nu$ . The probability of a negative cash position at the end of one year is  

$$
N { \left( - \frac { x + 2 . 0 } { 4 } \right) }
$$  

where $N ( x )$ is the cumulative probability that a standardized normal variable (with mean zero and standard deviation 1.0) is less than $x$ . From the properties of the normal distribution  

$$
N { \left( - \frac { x + 2 . 0 } { 4 } \right) } = 0 . 0 5
$$  

when:  

$$
- { \frac { x + 2 . 0 } { 4 } } = - 1 . 6 4 4 9
$$  

that is, when $x = 4 . 5 7 9 6$ . The initial cash position must therefore be $\$ 4.58$ million.  

# 14.3  

(a) Suppose that $X _ { 1 }$ and $X _ { 2 }$ equal $a _ { 1 }$ and $a _ { 2 }$ initially. After a time period of length $T , X _ { 1 }$ has the probability distribution  

$$
\varphi ( a _ { 1 } + \mu _ { 1 } T , \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } T )
$$  

and $X _ { _ 2 }$ has a probability distribution  

$$
\varphi ( a _ { 2 } + \mu _ { 2 } T , \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } T )
$$  

From the property of sums of independent normally distributed variables, $X _ { 1 } + X _ { 2 }$ has the probability distribution  

$$
\varphi \big ( a _ { 1 } + \mu _ { 1 } T + a _ { 2 } + \mu _ { 2 } T , \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } T + \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } T \big )
$$  

that is,  

$$
\varphi \Big [ a _ { 1 } + a _ { 2 } + ( \mu _ { 1 } + \mu _ { 2 } ) T , ( \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } ) T \Big ]
$$  

This shows that $X _ { 1 } + X _ { 2 }$ follows a generalized Wiener process with drift rate $\mu _ { 1 } + \mu _ { 2 }$ and variance rate $\sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 }$ .  

(b)  In this case, the change in the value of $X _ { 1 } + X _ { 2 }$ in a short interval of time $\Delta t$ has the probability distribution:  

$$
\varphi \Big [ ( \mu _ { 1 } + \mu _ { 2 } ) \Delta t , ( \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } + 2 \rho \sigma _ { 1 } \sigma _ { 2 } ) \Delta t \Big ]
$$  

If $\mu _ { 1 } , \mu _ { 2 } , \sigma _ { 1 } , \sigma _ { 2 }$ and $\rho$ are all constant, arguments similar to those in Section 14.2 show that the change in a longer period of time $T$ is  

$$
\varphi \Big [ ( \mu _ { 1 } + \mu _ { 2 } ) T , ( \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } + 2 \rho \sigma _ { 1 } \sigma _ { 2 } ) T \Big ]
$$  

The variable, $X _ { 1 } + X _ { 2 }$ , therefore follows a generalized Wiener process with drift rate $\mu _ { 1 } + \mu _ { 2 }$ and variance rate $\sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } + 2 \rho \sigma _ { 1 } \sigma _ { 2 }$ .  

14.4 The change in $S$ during the first three years has the probability distribution  

$$
\varphi ( 2 \times 3 , 9 \times 3 ) = \varphi ( 6 , 2 7 )
$$  

The change during the next three years has the probability distribution  

$$
\varphi ( 3 \times 3 , 1 6 \times 3 ) = \varphi ( 9 , 4 8 )
$$  

The change during the six years is the sum of a variable with probability distribution $\varphi ( 6 , 2 7 )$ and a variable with probability distribution $\varphi ( 9 , 4 8 )$ . The probability distribution of the change is therefore  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { \varphi ( 6 + 9 , 2 7 + 4 8 ) } } \\ { { } } \\ { { = \varphi ( 1 5 , 7 5 ) } } \end{array}
$$  

Since the initial value of the variable is 5, the probability distribution of the value of the variable at the end of year six is  

$$
\varphi ( 2 0 , 7 5 )
$$  

# 14.5  

From Itô's lemma  

$$
\sigma _ { \scriptscriptstyle G } G = \frac { \partial G } { \partial S } \sigma _ { s } S
$$  

Also the drift of $G$ is  

$$
\frac { \partial G } { \partial S } \mu S + \frac { \partial G } { \partial t } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } G } { \partial S ^ { 2 } } \sigma ^ { 2 } S ^ { 2 }
$$  

where $\mu$ is the expected return on the stock. When $\mu$ increases by $\lambda \sigma _ { s }$ , the drift of G increases by  

$$
\frac { \partial G } { \partial S } \lambda \sigma _ { s } S
$$  

or  

$$
\lambda \sigma _ { { \scriptscriptstyle G } } G
$$  

The growth rate of $G$ , therefore, increases by $\lambda \sigma _ { _ { G } }$ .  

# 14.6  

Define $S _ { A } , \mu _ { _ A }$ and $\sigma _ { \scriptscriptstyle A }$ as the stock price, expected return and volatility for stock A. Define $S _ { B } , \mu _ { B }$ and $\sigma _ { B }$ as the stock price, expected return and volatility for stock B. Define $\Delta S _ { _ A }$ and $\Delta S _ { B }$ as the change in $S _ { \it A }$ and $S _ { B }$ in time $\Delta t$ . Since each of the two stocks follows geometric Brownian motion,  

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \Delta S _ { A } = \mu _ { _ { A } } S _ { A } \Delta t + \sigma _ { _ { A } } S _ { A } \varepsilon _ { _ { A } } \sqrt { \Delta t } } \\ { \ } \\ { \Delta S _ { B } = \mu _ { _ { B } } S _ { B } \Delta t + \sigma _ { _ { B } } S _ { B } \varepsilon _ { _ { B } } \sqrt { \Delta t } } \end{array}
$$  

where $ { \varepsilon } _ { A }$ and $\mathcal { E } _ { B }$ are independent random samples from a normal distribution.  

$$
\Delta S _ { { \scriptscriptstyle A } } + \Delta S _ { { \scriptscriptstyle B } } = ( \mu _ { { \scriptscriptstyle A } } S _ { { \scriptscriptstyle A } } + \mu _ { { \scriptscriptstyle B } } S _ { { \scriptscriptstyle B } } ) \Delta t + ( \sigma _ { { \scriptscriptstyle A } } S _ { { \scriptscriptstyle A } } \varepsilon _ { { \scriptscriptstyle A } } + \sigma _ { { \scriptscriptstyle B } } S _ { { \scriptscriptstyle B } } \varepsilon _ { { \scriptscriptstyle B } } ) \sqrt { \Delta t }
$$  

This cannot be written as  

$$
\Delta S _ { _ A } + \Delta S _ { _ B } = \mu ( S _ { _ A } + S _ { _ B } ) \Delta t + \sigma ( S _ { _ A } + S _ { _ B } ) \varepsilon \sqrt { \Delta t }
$$  

for any constants $\mu$ and $\sigma$ . (Neither the drift term nor the stochastic term correspond.) Hence, the value of the portfolio does not follow geometric Brownian motion.  

# 14.7  

In  

$$
\Delta S = \mu S \Delta t + \sigma S \varepsilon { \sqrt { \Delta t } }
$$  

the expected increase in the stock price and the variability of the stock price are constant when both are expressed as a proportion (or as a percentage) of the stock price. In  

$$
\Delta S = \mu \Delta t + \sigma \varepsilon { \sqrt { \Delta t } }
$$  

the expected increase in the stock price and the variability of the stock price are constant in absolute terms. For example, if the expected growth rate is $\$ 5$ per annum when the stock price is $\$ 25$ , it is also $\$ 5$ per annum when it is $\$ 100$ . If the standard deviation of weekly stock price movements is $\$ 1$ when the price is $\$ 25$ , it is also $\$ 1$ when the price is $\$ 100$ . In  

$$
\Delta S = \mu S \Delta t + \sigma \varepsilon { \sqrt { \Delta t } }
$$  

the expected increase in the stock price is a constant proportion of the stock price while the variability is constant in absolute terms.  

In  

$$
\Delta S = \mu \Delta t + \sigma S \varepsilon { \sqrt { \Delta t } }
$$  

the expected increase in the stock price is constant in absolute terms while the variability of the proportional stock price change is constant.   
The model  

$$
\Delta S = \mu S \Delta t + \sigma S \varepsilon { \sqrt { \Delta t } }
$$  

is the most appropriate one since it is most realistic to assume that the expected percentage return and the variability of the percentage return in a short interval are constant.  

# 14.8  

The drift rate is $a ( b - r )$ . Thus, when the interest rate is above $b$ the drift rate is negative and, when the interest rate is below $b$ , the drift rate is positive. The interest rate is therefore continually pulled towards the level $b$ . The rate at which it is pulled toward this level is a . A volatility equal to $c$ is superimposed upon the "pull" or the drift.  

Suppose $a = 0 . 4$ , $b = 0 . 1$ and $c = 0 . 1 5$ and the current interest rate is $20 \%$ per annum. The interest rate is pulled towards the level of $10 \%$ per annum. This can be regarded as a long run average. The current drift is $- 4 \%$ per annum so that the expected rate at the end of one year is about $1 6 \%$ per annum. (In fact, it is slightly greater than this, because as the interest rate decreases, the "pull" decreases.) Superimposed upon the drift is a volatility of $1 5 \%$ per annum.  

# 14.9  

If $G ( S , t ) = S ^ { n }$ then $\partial G / \partial t = 0$ , ${ \partial G } / { \partial S } = n S ^ { n - 1 }$ , and $\partial ^ { 2 } G / \partial S ^ { 2 } = n ( n - 1 ) S ^ { n - 2 }$ . Using Itô's lemma  

$$
d G = [ \mu n G + \frac { 1 } { 2 } n ( n - 1 ) \sigma ^ { 2 } G ] d t + \sigma n G d z
$$  

This shows that $G = S ^ { n }$ follows geometric Brownian motion where the expected return is  

$$
\mu n + \frac { 1 } { 2 } n ( n - 1 ) \sigma ^ { 2 }
$$  

and the volatility is $n \sigma$ . The stock price $S$ has an expected return of $\mu$ and the expected value of $S _ { T }$ is $S _ { 0 } e ^ { \mu T }$ . The expected value of $S _ { T } ^ { n }$ is  

$$
S _ { 0 } ^ { n } e ^ { [ \mu n + \frac { 1 } { 2 } n ( n - 1 ) \sigma ^ { 2 } ] T }
$$  

# 14.10  

The process followed by $B$ , the bond price, is from Itô's lemma,  

$$
d B = \left[ { \frac { \hat { \sigma } B } { \hat { \sigma } x } } a ( x _ { 0 } - x ) + { \frac { \hat { \sigma } B } { \hat { \sigma } t } } + { \frac { 1 } { 2 } } { \frac { \hat { \sigma } ^ { 2 } B } { \hat { \sigma } x ^ { 2 } } } s ^ { 2 } x ^ { 2 } \right] d t + { \frac { \hat { \sigma } B } { \hat { \sigma } x } } s x d z
$$  

Since  

$$
B = e ^ { - x ( T - t ) }
$$  

the required partial derivatives are:  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \cfrac { \hat { c } B } { \hat { \alpha } t } = x e ^ { - x ( T - t ) } = x B } \\ & { \cfrac { \hat { c } B } { \hat { \alpha } x } = - ( T - t ) e ^ { - x ( T - t ) } = - ( T - t ) B } \\ & { \cfrac { \hat { \mathcal { D } } ^ { 2 } B } { \hat { \alpha } x ^ { 2 } } = \left( T - t \right) ^ { 2 } e ^ { - x ( T - t ) } = \left( T - t \right) ^ { 2 } B } \end{array}
$$  

Hence,  

$$
d B = \left[ - a ( x _ { 0 } - x ) ( T - t ) + x + \frac 1 2 s ^ { 2 } x ^ { 2 } ( T - t ) ^ { 2 } \right] B d t - s x ( T - t ) B d z
$$  

# 14.11  (Excel Spreadsheet)  

The process is  

$$
\Delta S = 0 . 0 9 \times S \times \Delta t + 0 . 2 0 \times S \times \varepsilon \times \sqrt { \Delta t }
$$  

where $\Delta t$ is the length of the time step $( = 1 / 1 2 )$ and  is a random sample from a standard normal distribution.  

# 14.12  

(a) With the notation in the text  

$$
\frac { \Delta S } { S } \approx \varphi \big ( \mu \Delta t , \sigma ^ { 2 } \Delta t \big )
$$  

In this case, $S = 5 0$ , $\mu = 0 . 1 6$ , $\sigma = 0 . 3 0$ and $\Delta t = 1 / 3 6 5 = 0 . 0 0 2 7 4$ . Hence,  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { \displaystyle \frac { \Delta S } { 5 0 } { \sim } \varphi ( 0 . 1 6 \times 0 . 0 0 2 7 4 , 0 . 0 9 \times 0 . 0 0 2 7 4 ) } } \\ { { \displaystyle \ } } \\ { { \displaystyle \qquad = \varphi ( 0 . 0 0 0 4 4 , 0 . 0 0 0 2 4 7 ) } } \end{array}
$$  

and  

$$
\Delta S \sim \varphi ( 5 0 \times 0 . 0 0 0 4 4 , 5 0 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 0 0 0 2 4 7 )
$$  

that is,  

$$
\Delta S \sim \varphi ( 0 . 0 2 2 , 0 . 6 1 6 4 )
$$  

(a) The expected stock price at the end of the next day is therefore 50.022. (b) The standard deviation of the stock price at the end of the next day is . ${ \sqrt { 0 . 6 1 5 4 } } = 0 . 7 8 5$ (c) $9 5 \%$ confidence limits for the stock price at the end of the next day are:  

$$
5 0 . 0 2 2 - 1 . 9 6 \times 0 . 7 8 5 \quad \mathrm { a n d } \quad 5 0 . 0 2 2 + 1 . 9 6 \times 0 . 7 8 5
$$  

that is,  

# 4848 and 5156  

Note that some students may consider one trading day rather than one calendar day. Then  

$\Delta t = 1 / 2 5 2 = 0 . 0 0 3 9 7$ . The answer to (a) is then 50.032. The answer to (b) is 0.945. The answers to part (c) are 48.18 and 51.88.  

14.13 The process followed by $B$ , the bond price, is from Itô's lemma:  

$$
d B = \left[ { \frac { \hat { \sigma } B } { \hat { \sigma } x } } a ( x _ { 0 } - x ) + { \frac { \hat { \sigma } B } { \hat { \sigma } t } } + { \frac { 1 } { 2 } } { \frac { \hat { \sigma } ^ { 2 } B } { \hat { \sigma } x ^ { 2 } } } s ^ { 2 } x ^ { 2 } \right] d t + { \frac { \hat { \sigma } B } { \hat { \sigma } x } } s x d z
$$  

In this case,  

$$
B = { \frac { 1 } { x } }
$$  

so that  

$$
{ \frac { \partial B } { \partial t } } = 0 ; \quad { \frac { \partial B } { \partial x } } = - { \frac { 1 } { x ^ { 2 } } } ; \quad { \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } B } { \partial x ^ { 2 } } } = { \frac { 2 } { x ^ { 3 } } }
$$  

Hence,  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { d B = \left[ - a ( x _ { 0 } - x ) \displaystyle \frac 1 { x ^ { 2 } } + \frac 1 2 s ^ { 2 } x ^ { 2 } \displaystyle \frac 2 { x ^ { 3 } } \right] d t - \displaystyle \frac 1 { x ^ { 2 } } s x d z } } \\ { { = \left[ - a ( x _ { 0 } - x ) \displaystyle \frac 1 { x ^ { 2 } } + \frac { s ^ { 2 } } x \right] d t - \displaystyle \frac s x d z } } \end{array}
$$  

The expected instantaneous rate at which capital gains are earned from the bond is therefore,  

$$
- a ( x _ { 0 } - x ) \frac { 1 } { x ^ { 2 } } + \frac { s ^ { 2 } } { x }
$$  

The expected interest per unit time is 1. The total expected instantaneous return is therefore,  

$$
1 - a ( x _ { 0 } - x ) \frac { 1 } { x ^ { 2 } } + \frac { s ^ { 2 } } { x }
$$  

When expressed as a proportion of the bond price this is  

$$
{ \Biggl ( } 1 - a ( x _ { 0 } - x ) { \frac { 1 } { x ^ { 2 } } } + { \frac { s ^ { 2 } } { x } } { \Biggr ) } { \Biggl / } { \Biggl ( } { \frac { 1 } { x } } { \Biggr ) }
$$  

$$
= x - \frac { a } { x } ( x _ { 0 } - x ) + s ^ { 2 }
$$  

# 14.14  (See Excel Worksheet)  

The processes are:  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { \Delta S _ { \cal A } = 0 . 1 1 \times S _ { \cal A } \times \Delta t + 0 . 2 5 \times S _ { \cal A } \times \varepsilon _ { \cal A } \times \sqrt { \Delta t } } \\ { \Delta S _ { \cal B } = 0 . 1 5 \times S _ { \cal B } \times \Delta t + 0 . 3 0 \times S _ { \cal B } \times \varepsilon _ { \cal B } \times \sqrt { \Delta t } } \end{array}
$$  

Where $\Delta t$ is the length of the time step $( = 1 / 2 5 2 )$ and the 's are correlated samples from standard normal distributions.

# CHAPTER 15 The Black-Scholes-Merton Model  

# Practice Questions  

# 15.1  

The Black–Scholes–Merton option pricing model assumes that the probability distribution of the stock price in 1 year (or at any other future time) is lognormal. It assumes that the continuously compounded rate of return on the stock during the year is normally distributed.  

# 15.2  

The standard deviation of the percentage price change in time $\Delta t$ is $\sigma \sqrt { \Delta t }$ where $\sigma$ is the volatility. In this problem, $\sigma = 0 . 3$ and, assuming 252 trading days in one year, $\Delta t = 1 / 2 5 2 = 0 . 0 0 4$ so that $\sigma \sqrt { \Delta t } = 0 . 3 \sqrt { 0 . 0 0 4 } = 0 . 0 1 9$ or $1 . 9 \%$ .  

# 15.3  

In this case, $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 5 0$ , $K = 5 0$ , $r = 0 . 1$ , $\sigma = 0 . 3$ , $T = 0 . 2 5$ , and  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 5 0 / 5 0 ) + ( 0 . 1 + 0 . 0 9 / 2 ) 0 . 2 5 } { 0 . 3 { \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } } } } = 0 . 2 4 1 7
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 3 { \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } } = 0 . 0 9 1 7
$$  

The European put price is  

$$
5 0 N ( - 0 . 0 9 1 7 ) e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 0 . 2 5 } - 5 0 N ( - 0 . 2 4 1 7 )
$$  

$$
= 5 0 \times 0 . 4 6 3 4 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 0 . 2 5 } - 5 0 \times 0 . 4 0 4 5 = 2 . 3 7
$$  

or $\$ 2.37$ .  

# 15.4  

In this case, we must subtract the present value of the dividend from the stock price before using Black–Scholes–Merton. Hence, the appropriate value of $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } }$ is  

$$
S _ { \scriptscriptstyle 0 } = 5 0 - 1 . 5 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 6 6 7 \times 0 . 1 } = 4 8 . 5 2
$$  

As before, $K = 5 0$ , $r = 0 . 1$ , $\sigma = 0 . 3$ , and $T = 0 . 2 5$ . In this case,  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 4 8 . 5 2 / 5 0 ) + ( 0 . 1 + 0 . 0 9 / 2 ) 0 . 2 5 } { 0 . 3 { \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } } } } = 0 . 0 4 1 4
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 3 \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } = - 0 . 1 0 8 6
$$  

The European put price is  

$$
5 0 N ( 0 . 1 0 8 6 ) e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 0 . 2 5 } - 4 8 . 5 2 N ( - 0 . 0 4 1 4 )
$$  

$$
= 5 0 \times 0 . 5 4 3 2 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 0 . 2 5 } - 4 8 . 5 2 \times 0 . 4 8 3 5 = 3 . 0 3
$$  

or $\$ 3.03$ .  

# 15.5  

In this case, $\mu = 0 . 1 5$ and $\sigma = 0 . 2 5$ . From equation (15.7), the probability distribution for the rate of return over a two-year period with continuous compounding is  

$$
\Phi \left( 0 . 1 5 - { \frac { 0 . 2 5 ^ { 2 } } { 2 } } , { \frac { 0 . 2 5 ^ { 2 } } { 2 } } \right)
$$  

that is,  

The expected value of the return is $1 1 . 8 7 5 \%$ per annum and the standard deviation is $1 7 . 7 \%$ per annum.  

# 15.6  

a) The required probability is the probability of the stock price being above $\$ 40$ in six months. Suppose that the stock price in six months is $S _ { T }$  

$$
\ln S _ { T } \sim \varphi { \Bigg [ } \ln 3 8 + \left( 0 . 1 6 - { \frac { 0 . 3 5 ^ { 2 } } { 2 } } \right) 0 . 5 , 0 . 3 5 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 5 { \Bigg ] }
$$  

that is,  

$$
\ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } \sim \varphi ^ { \big ( 3 . 6 8 7 , 0 . 2 4 7 ^ { 2 } \big ) }
$$  

Since $\ln { 4 0 } = 3 . 6 8 9$ , we require the probability of $\ln ( \mathrm { S _ { T } } ) { > } 3 . 6 8 9$ . This is  

$$
1 - N \left( { \frac { 3 . 6 8 9 - 3 . 6 8 7 } { 0 . 2 4 7 } } \right) = 1 - N ( 0 . 0 0 8 )
$$  

Since $\mathrm { N } ( 0 . 0 0 8 ) = 0 . 5 0 3 2$ , the required probability is 0.4968.  

b) In this case, the required probability is the probability of the stock price being less than $\$ 40$ in six months time. It is  

$$
1 - 0 . 4 9 6 8 = 0 . 5 0 3 2
$$  

# 15.7  

From equation (15.3),  

$$
\ln S _ { \cal T } \sim \varphi \Biggl [ \ln S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } + \left( \mu - \frac { \sigma ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \right) T , \sigma ^ { 2 } T \Biggr ]
$$  

$9 5 \%$ confidence intervals for $\ln S _ { T }$ are therefore,  

$$
\ln S _ { 0 } + ( \mu - \frac { \sigma ^ { 2 } } { 2 } ) T - 1 . 9 6 \sigma \sqrt { T }
$$  

and  

$$
\ln S _ { 0 } + ( \mu - \frac { \sigma ^ { 2 } } { 2 } ) T + 1 . 9 6 \sigma \sqrt { T }
$$  

$9 5 \%$ confidence intervals for $S _ { T }$ are therefore,  

$$
e ^ { \ln S _ { 0 } + ( \mu - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) T - 1 . 9 6 \sigma \sqrt { T } } \qquad \mathrm { a n d } \qquad e ^ { \ln S _ { 0 } + ( \mu - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) T + 1 . 9 6 \sigma \sqrt { T } }
$$  

that is,  

$$
S _ { 0 } e ^ { ( \mu - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) T - 1 . 9 6 \sigma \sqrt { T } } \qquad \mathrm { a n d } \qquad S _ { 0 } e ^ { ( \mu - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) T + 1 . 9 6 \sigma \sqrt { T } }
$$  

# 15.8  

This problem relates to the material in Section 15.3 and Business Snapshot 15.1. The statement is misleading in that a certain sum of money, say $\$ 1,000$ , when invested for 10 years in the fund would have realized a return (with annual compounding) of less than $20 \%$ per annum.  

The average of the returns realized in each year is always greater than the return per annum (with annual compounding) realized over 10 years. The first is an arithmetic average of the returns in each year; the second is a geometric average of these returns.  

# 15.9  

a)  At time $t$ , the expected value of ln $S _ { T }$ is from equation (15.3),  

$$
\ln S + ( \mu - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) ( T - t )
$$  

In a risk-neutral world, the expected value of  ln $S _ { T }$ is therefore,  

$$
\ln S + ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) ( T - t )
$$  

Using risk-neutral valuation, the value of the derivative at time $t$ is  

$$
e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } [ \ln S + ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) ( T - t ) ]
$$  

b) If  

then  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { = e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } [ \ln S + ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) ( T - t ) ] } \\ & { \qquad \frac { \partial f } { \partial t } = r e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } [ \ln S + ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) ( T - t ) ] - e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } \left( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 \right) } \\ & { \qquad \frac { \partial f } { \partial N } = \frac { e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } } { S } } \\ & { \qquad \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } f } { \partial S ^ { 2 } } = - \frac { e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } } { S ^ { 2 } } } \end{array}
$$  

The left-hand side of the Black–Scholes–Merton differential equation is  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } \Big [ r \ln S + r ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) ( T - t ) - ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) + r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 \Big ] } \\ & { = e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } \Big [ r \ln S + r ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) ( T - t ) \Big ] } \\ & { = r f } \end{array}
$$  

Hence, the differential equation is satisfied.  

# 15.10  

If $G ( S , t ) = h ( t , T ) S ^ { n }$ then $\partial G / \partial t = h _ { t } { S } ^ { n }$ , ${ \partial G } / { \partial S } = h n S ^ { n - 1 }$ , and $\partial ^ { 2 } G / \partial S ^ { 2 } = h n ( n - 1 ) S ^ { n - 2 }$ where $h _ { \scriptscriptstyle t } = \partial h / \partial t$ . Substituting into the Black–Scholes–Merton differential equation, we obtain  

$$
h _ { t } + r h n + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } h n ( n - 1 ) = r h
$$  

The derivative is worth $S ^ { n }$ when $t = T$ . The boundary condition for this differential equation is therefore $h ( T , T ) = 1$  

The equation  

$$
h ( t , T ) = e ^ { [ 0 . 5 \sigma ^ { 2 } n ( n - 1 ) + r ( n - 1 ) ] ( T - t ) }
$$  

satisfies the boundary condition since it collapses to $h = 1$ when $t = T$ . It can also be shown that it satisfies the differential equation in (a). Alternatively, we can solve the differential equation in (a) directly. The differential equation can be written  

$$
\frac { h _ { t } } { h } = - r ( n - 1 ) - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } n ( n - 1 )
$$  

The solution to this is  

$$
\ln h = [ r ( n - 1 ) + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } n ( n - 1 ) ] ( T - t )
$$  

or  

$$
h ( t , T ) = e ^ { [ 0 . 5 \sigma ^ { 2 } n ( n - 1 ) + r ( n - 1 ) ] ( T - t ) }
$$  

# 15.11  

In this case, $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 5 2$ , $K = 5 0$ , $r = 0 . 1 2$ , $\sigma = 0 . 3 0$ and $T = 0 . 2 5$ .  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 5 2 / 5 0 ) + ( 0 . 1 2 + 0 . 3 ^ { 2 } / 2 ) 0 . 2 5 } { 0 . 3 0 { \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } } } } = 0 . 5 3 6 5
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 3 0 { \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } } = 0 . 3 8 6 5
$$  

The price of the European call is  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { 5 2 N ( 0 . 5 3 6 5 ) - 5 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 2 \times 0 . 2 5 } N ( 0 . 3 8 6 5 ) } \\ & { ~ = 5 2 \times 0 . 7 0 4 2 - 5 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 } \times 0 . 6 5 0 4 } \\ & { ~ = 5 . 0 6 } \end{array}
$$  

or $\$ 5.06$ .  

# 15.12  

In this case, $S _ { 0 } = 6 9$ , $K = 7 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 5$ , $\sigma = 0 . 3 5$ and $T = 0 . 5$ .  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 6 9 / 7 0 ) + ( 0 . 0 5 + 0 . 3 5 ^ { 2 } / 2 ) \times 0 . 5 } { 0 . 3 5 { \sqrt { 0 . 5 } } } } = 0 . 1 6 6 6
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 3 5 { \sqrt { 0 . 5 } } = - 0 . 0 8 0 9
$$  

The price of the European put is  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { 7 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } N ( 0 . 0 8 0 9 ) - 6 9 N ( - 0 . 1 6 6 6 ) } } \\ { { = 7 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 2 5 } \times 0 . 5 3 2 3 - 6 9 \times 0 . 4 3 3 8 } } \\ { { = 6 . 4 0 } } \end{array}
$$  

or $\$ 6.40$ .  

# 15.13  

Using the notation of Section 15.12, $D _ { 1 } = D _ { 2 } = 1 , K ( 1 - e ^ { - r ( T - t _ { 2 } ) } ) = 6 5 ( 1 - e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 0 . 1 6 6 7 } ) = 1 . 0 7 ,$ and $K ( 1 - e ^ { - r ( t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 } ) } ) = 6 5 ( 1 - e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 0 . 2 5 } ) = 1 . 6 0$ . Since  

$$
D _ { 1 } < K ( 1 - e ^ { - r ( T - t _ { 2 } ) } )
$$  

and  

$$
D _ { 2 } < K ( 1 - e ^ { - r ( t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 } ) } )
$$  

It is never optimal to exercise the call option early. DerivaGem shows that the value of the  

option is 10 94 .  

# 15.14  

In the case, $c = 2 . 5$ , $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 1 5$ , $K = 1 3$ , $T = 0 . 2 5$ , $r = 0 . 0 5$ . The implied volatility must be calculated using an iterative procedure.  

A volatility of 0.2 (or $20 \%$ per annum) gives $c = 2 . 2 0$ . A volatility of 0.3 gives $c = 2 . 3 2$ . A volatility of 0.4 gives $c = 2 . 5 0 7$ . A volatility of 0.39 gives $c = 2 . 4 8 7$ . By interpolation, the implied volatility is about 0.396 or $3 9 . 6 \%$ per annum.  

The implied volatility can also be calculated using DerivaGem. Select equity as the Underlying Type in the first worksheet. Select Black–Scholes European as the Option Type. Input stock price as 15, the risk-free rate as $5 \%$ , time to exercise as 0.25, and exercise price as 13. Leave the dividend table blank because we are assuming no dividends. Select the button corresponding to call. Select the implied volatility button. Input the Price as 2.5 in the second half of the option data table. Hit the Enter key and click on calculate. DerivaGem will show the volatility of the option as $3 9 . 6 4 \%$ .  

# 15.15  

(a) Since $N ( x )$ is the cumulative probability that a variable with a standardized normal distribution will be less than x , $N ^ { \prime } ( x )$ is the probability density function for a standardized normal distribution, that is,  

$$
N ^ { \prime } ( x ) = { \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 \pi } } } e ^ { - { \frac { x ^ { 2 } } { 2 } } }
$$  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) = N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 2 } + \sigma \sqrt { T - t } ) } } \\ { { = \displaystyle \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 \pi } } \exp \Biggl [ - \frac { d _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } } { 2 } - \sigma d _ { 2 } \sqrt { T - t } - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } ( T - t ) \Biggr ] } } \\ { { = N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 2 } ) \exp \Biggl [ - \sigma d _ { 2 } \sqrt { T - t } - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } ( T - t ) \Biggr ] } } \end{array}
$$  

Because  

$$
d _ { 2 } = { \frac { \ln ( S / K ) + ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) ( T - t ) } { \sigma { \sqrt { T - t } } } }
$$  

it follows that  

$$
\exp \biggl [ - \sigma d _ { 2 } \sqrt { T - t } - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } ( T - t ) \biggr ] = \frac { K e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } } { S }
$$  

As a result,  

$$
S N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) = K e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 2 } )
$$  

which is the required result.  

(c)  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { d _ { 1 } = \displaystyle \frac { \ln \frac { S } { K } + ( r + \frac { \sigma ^ { 2 } } { 2 } ) ( T - t ) } { \sigma \sqrt { T - t } } } \\ { = \displaystyle \frac { \ln S - \ln K + ( r + \frac { \sigma ^ { 2 } } { 2 } ) ( T - t ) } { \sigma \sqrt { T - t } } } \end{array}
$$  

Hence,  

$$
\frac { \partial d _ { 1 } } { \partial S } = \frac { 1 } { S \sigma \sqrt { T - t } }
$$  

Similarly,  

$$
d _ { 2 } = { \frac { \ln S - \ln K + ( r - { \frac { \sigma ^ { 2 } } { 2 } } ) ( T - t ) } { \sigma { \sqrt { T - t } } } }
$$  

and  

$$
\frac { \partial d _ { 2 } } { \partial S } = \frac { 1 } { S \sigma \sqrt { T - t } }
$$  

Therefore,  

$$
\frac { \partial d _ { 1 } } { \partial S } = \frac { \partial d _ { 2 } } { \partial S }
$$  

(d)  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { c = S N ( d _ { 1 } ) - K e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } N ( d _ { 2 } ) } } \\ { { \displaystyle \frac { \partial c } { \partial t } = S N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \frac { \partial d _ { 1 } } { \partial t } - r K e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } N ( d _ { 2 } ) - K e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 2 } ) \frac { \partial d _ { 2 } } { \partial t } } } \end{array}
$$  

From (b),  

$$
S N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) = K e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 2 } )
$$  

Hence,  

$$
\frac { \hat {  { \partial } } c } { \hat {  { \partial } } t } = - r K e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } N ( d _ { 2 } ) + S N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \mathopen { } \mathclose \bgroup \left( \frac { \hat {  { \partial } } d _ { 1 } } { \hat {  { \partial } } t } - \frac { \hat {  { \partial } } d _ { 2 } } { \hat {  { \partial } } t } \aftergroup \egroup \right)
$$  

Since  

$$
d _ { 1 } - d _ { 2 } = \sigma \sqrt { T - t }
$$  

$$
\frac { \partial d _ { 1 } } { \partial t } - \frac { \partial d _ { 2 } } { \partial t } = \frac { \partial } { \partial t } ( \sigma \sqrt { T - t } )
$$  

$$
= - { \frac { \sigma } { 2 { \sqrt { T - t } } } }
$$  

Hence,  

$$
\frac { \partial c } { \partial t } = - r K e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } N ( d _ { 2 } ) - S N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \frac { \sigma } { 2 \sqrt { T - t } }
$$  

(e) From differentiating the Black–Scholes–Merton formula for a call price, we obtain  

$$
\frac { \hat { \sigma } c } { \hat { \sigma } S } = N ( d _ { 1 } ) + S N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \frac { \hat { \sigma } d _ { 1 } } { \hat { \sigma } S } - K e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 2 } ) \frac { \hat { \sigma } d _ { 2 } } { d S }
$$  

From the results in (b) and (c), it follows that  

$$
\frac { \partial c } { \partial S } = N ( d _ { 1 } )
$$  

(f) Differentiating the result in (e) and using the result in (c), we obtain  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { \displaystyle \frac { \hat { \partial } ^ { 2 } c } { \hat { \partial } S ^ { 2 } } = N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \frac { \hat { \partial } d _ { 1 } } { \hat { \partial } S } } } \\ { { = N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \displaystyle \frac { 1 } { S \sigma \sqrt { T - t } } } } \end{array}
$$  

From the results in $\mathrm { d }$ ) and e)  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { \displaystyle \frac { \hat { \alpha } c } { \hat { \alpha } t } + r S \frac { \hat { c } c } { \hat { \alpha } S } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } S ^ { 2 } \frac { \hat { \alpha } ^ { 2 } c } { \hat { \alpha } S ^ { 2 } } = - r K e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } N ( d _ { 2 } ) - S N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \frac { \sigma } { 2 \sqrt { T - t } } } } \\ { { \displaystyle \quad \quad + r S N ( d _ { 1 } ) + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } S ^ { 2 } N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \frac { 1 } { S \sigma \sqrt { T - t } } } } \\ { { \displaystyle \quad = r [ S N ( d _ { 1 } ) - K e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } N ( d _ { 2 } ) ] } } \\ { { \displaystyle \quad = r c } } \end{array}
$$  

This shows that the Black–Scholes–Merton formula for a call option does indeed satisfy the Black–Scholes–Merton differential equation.  

(g) Consider what happens in the formula for $c$ in part (d) as $t$ approaches $T$ . If $S > K$ , $d _ { \mathrm { { \scriptscriptstyle 1 } } }$ and $d _ { 2 }$ tend to infinity and $N ( d _ { 1 } )$ and $N ( d _ { 2 } )$ tend to 1. If $S < K$ , $d _ { \mathrm { { \scriptscriptstyle 1 } } }$ and $d _ { 2 }$ tend to minus infinity and $N ( d _ { 1 } )$ and $N ( d _ { 2 } )$ tend to zero. It follows that the formula for $c$ tends to $\operatorname* { m a x } ( S - K , 0 )$ .  

# 15.16  

The Black–Scholes–Merton formula for a European call option is  

$$
c = S _ { 0 } N ( d _ { 1 } ) - K e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } )
$$  

so that  

$$
c + K e ^ { - r T } = S _ { 0 } N ( d _ { 1 } ) - K e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } ) + K e ^ { - r T }
$$  

or  

$$
c + K e ^ { - r T } = S _ { 0 } N ( d _ { 1 } ) + K e ^ { - r T } [ 1 - N ( d _ { 2 } ) ]
$$  

or  

$$
c + K e ^ { - r T } = S _ { 0 } N ( d _ { 1 } ) + K e ^ { - r T } N ( - d _ { 2 } )
$$  

The Black–Scholes–Merton formula for a European put option is  

$$
p = K e ^ { - r T } N ( - d _ { 2 } ) - S _ { 0 } N ( - d _ { 1 } )
$$  

so that  

$$
p + S _ { 0 } = K e ^ { - r T } N ( - d _ { 2 } ) - S _ { 0 } N ( - d _ { 1 } ) + S _ { 0 }
$$  

or  

$$
p + S _ { 0 } = K e ^ { - r T } N ( - d _ { 2 } ) + S _ { 0 } [ 1 - N ( - d _ { 1 } ) ]
$$  

or  

$$
p + S _ { 0 } = K e ^ { - r T } N ( - d _ { 2 } ) + S _ { 0 } N ( d _ { 1 } )
$$  

This shows that the put–call parity result  

$$
c + K e ^ { - r T } = p + S _ { 0 }
$$  

holds.  

15.17 Using DerivaGem, we obtain the following table of implied volatilities:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Stock Price</td><td>Maturity = 3 months</td><td>Maturity = 6 months</td><td>Maturity =12 months</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>45</td><td>37.78</td><td>34.99</td><td>34.02</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>34.15</td><td>32.78</td><td>32.03</td></tr><tr><td>55</td><td>31.98</td><td>30.77</td><td>30.45</td></tr></table></body></html>  

To calculate the first number, select equity as the Underlying Type in the first worksheet. Select Black–Scholes European as the Option Type. Input stock price as 50, the risk-free rate as $5 \%$ , time to exercise as 0.25, and exercise price as 45. Leave the dividend table blank because we are assuming no dividends. Select the button corresponding to call. Select the implied volatility button. Input the Price as 7.0 in the second half of the option data table. Hit the Enter key and click on calculate. DerivaGem will show the volatility of the option as $3 7 . 7 8 \%$ . Change the strike price and time to exercise and recompute to calculate the rest of the numbers in the table.  

The option prices are not exactly consistent with Black–Scholes–Merton. If they were, the implied volatilities would be all the same. We usually find in practice that low strike price options on a stock have higher implied volatilities than high strike price options on the same stock. This phenomenon is discussed in Chapter 20.  

# 15.18  

Black's approach in effect assumes that the holder of option must decide at time zero whether it is a European option maturing at time $t _ { n }$ (the final ex-dividend date) or a European option maturing at time $T$ . In fact, the holder of the option has more flexibility than this. The holder can choose to exercise at time $t _ { n }$ if the stock price at that time is above some level but not otherwise. Furthermore, if the option is not exercised at time $t _ { n }$ , it can still be exercised at time $T$ .  

It appears that Black's approach should understate the true option value. This is because the holder of the option has more alternative strategies for deciding when to exercise the option than the two strategies implicitly assumed by the approach. These alternative strategies add value to the option.  

However, this is not the whole story! The standard approach to valuing either an American or a European option on a stock paying a single dividend applies the volatility to the stock price less the present value of the dividend. (The procedure for valuing an American option is explained in Chapter 21.) Black's approach when considering exercise just prior to the dividend date applies the volatility to the stock price itself. Black's approach therefore assumes more stock price variability than the standard approach in some of its calculations. In some circumstances, it can give a higher price than the standard approach.  

# 15.19  

With the notation in the text  

$$
D _ { 1 } = D _ { 2 } = 1 . 5 0 , t _ { 1 } = 0 . 3 3 3 3 , t _ { 2 } = 0 . 8 3 3 3 , T = 1 . 2 5 , r = 0 . 0 8 \mathrm { a r }
$$  

$$
K \Big [ 1 - e ^ { - r ( T - t _ { 2 } ) } \Big ] = 5 5 ( 1 - e ^ { - 0 . 0 8 \times 0 . 4 1 6 7 } ) = 1 . 8 0
$$  

Hence,  

$$
D _ { 2 } < K { \left[ 1 - e ^ { - r ( T - t _ { 2 } ) } \right] }
$$  

Also,  

$$
K \Big [ 1 - e ^ { - r ( t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 } ) } \Big ] = 5 5 ( 1 - e ^ { - 0 . 0 8 \times 0 . 5 } ) = 2 . 1 6
$$  

Hence,  

$$
D _ { 1 } < K { \Big [ } 1 - e ^ { - r ( t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 } ) } { \Big ] }
$$  

It follows from the conditions established in Section 15.12 that the option should never be exercised early.  

The present value of the dividends is  

$$
1 . 5 e ^ { - 0 . 3 3 3 3 \times 0 . 0 8 } + 1 . 5 e ^ { - 0 . 8 3 3 3 \times 0 . 0 8 } = 2 . 8 6 4
$$  

The option can be valued using the European pricing formula with:  

$$
S _ { 0 } = 5 0 - 2 . 8 6 4 = 4 7 . 1 3 6 , \quad K = 5 5 , \quad \sigma = 0 . 2 5 , \quad r = 0 . 0 8 , \quad T = 1 . 2 5
$$  

$$
d _ { 1 } = \frac { \ln ( 4 7 . 1 3 6 / 5 5 ) + ( 0 . 0 8 + 0 . 2 5 ^ { 2 } / 2 ) 1 . 2 5 } { 0 . 2 5 \sqrt { 1 . 2 5 } } = - 0 . 0 5 4 5
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 2 5 { \sqrt { 1 . 2 5 } } = - 0 . 3 3 4 0
$$  

$$
N ( d _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 4 7 8 3 , ~ N ( d _ { 2 } ) = 0 . 3 6 9 2
$$  

and the call price is  

$$
4 7 . 1 3 6 \times 0 . 4 7 8 3 - 5 5 e ^ { - 0 . 0 8 \times 1 . 2 5 } \times 0 . 3 6 9 2 = 4 . 1 7
$$  

or $\$ 4.17$ .  

# 15.20  

The probability that the call option will be exercised is the probability that $S _ { T } > K$ where $S _ { T }$ is the stock price at time $T$ . In a risk neutral world  

$$
\ln S _ { T } \sim \varphi \big [ \ln S _ { 0 } + ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) T , \sigma ^ { 2 } T \big ]
$$  

The probability that $S _ { T } > K$ is the same as the probability that $\ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } > \ln K$ . This is  

$$
1 - N \Bigg [ \frac { \ln K - \ln S _ { 0 } - ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) T } { \sigma \sqrt { T } } \Bigg ]
$$  

$$
= N \Bigg [ \frac { \ln ( S _ { 0 } / K ) + ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) T } { \sigma \sqrt { T } } \Bigg ]
$$  

$$
= N ( d _ { 2 } )
$$  

The expected value at time $T$ in a risk neutral world of a derivative security which pays off $\$ 100$ when $S _ { T } > K$ is therefore  

$$
1 0 0 N ( d _ { 2 } )
$$  

From risk neutral valuation, the value of the security at time zero is  

$$
1 0 0 e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } )
$$  

# 15.21  

If the perpetual American put is exercised when $S { = } H _ { ; }$ , it provides a payoff of $\left( K { - } H \right)$ . We obtain its value, by setting $Q { = } K { - } H$ in equation (15.17), as  

$$
V = ( K - H ) \bigg ( \frac { S } { H } \bigg ) ^ { - 2 r / \sigma ^ { 2 } } = ( K - H ) \bigg ( \frac { H } { S } \bigg ) ^ { 2 r / \sigma ^ { 2 } }
$$  

Now  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { \displaystyle \displaystyle \frac { d V } { d H } = - \left( \frac { H } { S } \right) ^ { 2 r / \sigma ^ { 2 } } + \frac { K - H } { S } \left( \frac { 2 r } { \sigma ^ { 2 } } \right) \left( \frac { H } { S } \right) ^ { 2 r / \sigma ^ { 2 } - 1 } } } \\ { { \displaystyle \quad \quad = \left( \frac { H } { S } \right) ^ { 2 r / \sigma ^ { 2 } } \left( - 1 + \frac { 2 r \left( K - H \right) } { H \sigma ^ { 2 } } \right) } } \\ { { \displaystyle \quad \displaystyle \frac { d ^ { 2 } V } { d H ^ { 2 } } = - \frac { 2 r K } { H ^ { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } } \left( \frac { H } { S } \right) ^ { 2 r / \sigma ^ { 2 } } + \left( - 1 + \frac { 2 r \left( K - H \right) } { H \sigma ^ { 2 } } \right) \frac { 2 r } { \sigma ^ { 2 } S } \left( \frac { H } { S } \right) ^ { 2 r / \sigma ^ { 2 } - 1 } } } \end{array}
$$  

$d V / d H$ is zero when  

$$
H = \frac { 2 r K } { 2 r + \sigma ^ { 2 } }
$$  

and, for this value of $H , d ^ { 2 } V / d H ^ { 2 }$ is negative indicating that it gives the maximum value of $V$  

The value of the perpetual American put is maximized if it is exercised when $S$ equals this value of $H$ . Hence the value of the perpetual American put is  

$$
( K - H ) { \Bigg ( } { \frac { S } { H } } { \Bigg ) } ^ { - 2 r / \sigma ^ { 2 } }
$$  

when $\scriptstyle H = 2 r K / ( 2 r + \sigma ^ { 2 } )$ . The value is  

$$
\frac { \sigma ^ { 2 } K } { 2 r + \sigma ^ { 2 } } \left( \frac { S ( 2 r + \sigma ^ { 2 } ) } { 2 r K } \right) ^ { - 2 r / \sigma ^ { 2 } }
$$  

This is consistent with the more general result produced in Chapter 26 for the case where the stock provides a dividend yield.  

# 15.22  

The answer is no. If markets are efficient, they have already taken potential dilution into account in determining the stock price. This argument is explained in Business Snapshot 15.3.  

# 15.23  

The Black–Scholes–Merton price of the option is given by setting $S _ { \scriptscriptstyle 0 } = 5 0 \ : , \ : K = 5 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 5$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2 5$ , and $T = 5$ . It is 16.252. From an analysis similar to that in Section 15.10, the cost to the company of the options is  

$$
{ \frac { 1 0 } { 1 0 + 3 } } \times 1 6 . 2 5 2 = 1 2 . 5
$$  

or about $\$ 12.5$ per option. The total cost is therefore 3 million times this or $\$ 37.5$ million. If the market perceives no benefits from the options, the stock price will fall by $\$ 3.75$ .  

# 15.24  

(a) $\begin{array} { r l } & { 0 . 1 8 \big / \sqrt { 2 5 2 } = 1 . 1 3 \% } \\ & { 0 . 1 8 \big / \sqrt { 5 2 } = 2 . 5 0 \% } \\ & { 0 . 1 8 \big / \sqrt { 1 2 } = 5 . 2 0 \% } \end{array}$   
(b)   
(c)  

# 15.25  

In this case, $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 5 0$ , $\mu = 0 . 1 8$ and $\sigma = 0 . 3 0$ . The probability distribution of the stock price in two years, $S _ { T }$ , is lognormal and is, from equation (15.3), given by:  

$$
\ln S _ { T } \sim \varphi { \Biggl [ } \ln 5 0 + { \Biggl ( } 0 . 1 8 - { \frac { 0 . 0 9 } { 2 } } { \Biggr ) } 2 , 0 . 3 ^ { 2 } \times 2 { \Biggr ] }
$$  

that is  

$$
\ln S _ { T } \sim \Phi ( 4 . 1 8 , 0 . 4 2 ^ { 2 } )
$$  

The mean stock price is from equation (15.4) $5 0 e ^ { 0 . 1 8 \times 2 } = 5 0 e ^ { 0 . 3 6 } = 7 1 . 6 7$ and the standard deviation is from equation (15.5)  

$$
5 0 e ^ { 0 . 1 8 \times 2 } \sqrt { e ^ { 0 . 0 9 \times 2 } - 1 } = 3 1 . 8 3
$$  

$9 5 \%$ confidence intervals for $\ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T }$ are:  

$$
4 . 1 8 - 1 . 9 6 \times 0 . 4 2 \quad \mathrm { a n d } \quad 4 . 1 8 + 1 . 9 6 \times 0 . 4 2
$$  

that is  

These correspond to $9 5 \%$ confidence limits for $S _ { T }$ of  

that is  

# 2852 and 15044  

# 15.26  (Excel file)  

The calculations are shown in the table below:  

$$
\sum u _ { i } = 0 . 0 9 4 7 1 \quad \sum u _ { i } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 1 1 4 5
$$  

and an estimate of standard deviation of weekly returns is:  

$$
{ \sqrt { \frac { 0 . 0 1 1 4 5 } { 1 3 } - { \frac { 0 . 0 9 4 7 1 ^ { 2 } } { 1 4 \times 1 3 } } } } = 0 . 0 2 8 8 4
$$  

The volatility per annum is therefore $0 . 0 2 8 8 4 \sqrt { 5 2 } = 0 . 2 0 7 9$ or $20 . 7 9 \%$ . The standard error of this estimate is  

$$
\frac { 0 . 2 0 7 9 } { \sqrt { 2 \times 1 4 } } = 0 . 0 3 9 3
$$  

or $3 . 9 \%$ per annum.

The easiest way of proving this is to note that $\operatorname* { m a x } ( V - K , 0 ) - \operatorname* { m a x } ( K - V , 0 ) = \mathrm { V - K }$  

so that  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } {  { E [ \operatorname* { m a x } ( K ^ { - } V , 0 ) ] = E [ \operatorname* { m a x } ( V - K , 0 ) ] - E ( V ) + \mathrm { K } } } \\ & { = E ( V ) N ( d _ { 1 } ) - K N ( d _ { 2 } ) - E ( V ) + K } \end{array}
$$  

Because $1 - N ( d _ { 2 } ) = N ( - d _ { 2 } )$ and $1 - N ( d _ { 1 } ) = N ( - d _ { 1 } )$ , this immediately gives the required result. (It can also be proved in the same way as the first result is proved in the appendix.)  

Because  

$$
p = e ^ { - r T } \hat { E } \big [ \operatorname* { m a x } ( K - S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } , 0 \big ]
$$  

and  

$$
\hat { E } ( S _ { T } ) = S _ { 0 } e ^ { r T }
$$  

The Black–Scholes–Merton pricing formula for a put option follows.  

# CHAPTER 16 Employee Stock Options  

# Practice Questions  

# 16.1  

This is questionable. Executives benefit from share price increases but do not bear the costs of share price decreases. Employee stock options are liable to encourage executives to take decisions that boost the value of the stock in the short term at the expense of the long term health of the company. It may even be the case that executives are encouraged to take high risks so as to maximize the value of their options.  

# 16.2  

Professional footballers are not allowed to bet on the outcomes of games because they themselves influence the outcomes. Arguably, executives should not be allowed to bet on the future stock price of their companies because their actions influence that price. However, it could be argued that there is nothing wrong with a professional footballer betting that his team will win (but everything wrong with betting that it will lose). Similarly there is nothing wrong with executives betting that their companies will do well.  

# 16.3  

If a stock option grant had to be revalued each quarter, the value of the option of the grant date (however determined) would become less important. Stock price movements following the reported grant date would be incorporated in the next revaluation. The total cost of the options would be independent of the stock price on the grant date.  

# 16.4  

It would be necessary to look at returns on each stock in the sample (possibly adjusted for the returns on the market and the beta of the stock) around the reported employee stock option grant date. One could designate Day 0 as the grant date and look at returns on each stock each day from Day $- 3 0$ to Day $+ 3 0$ . The returns would then be averaged across the stocks.  

# 16.5  

There should be no impact on the stock price because the stock price will already reflect the dilution expected from the executive's exercise decision.  

# 16.6  

The notes indicate that the Black–Scholes–Merton model was used to produce the valuation with $T _ { : }$ , the option life, being set equal to 5 years and the stock price volatility being set equal to $20 \%$ .  

# 16.7  

The price at which 10,000 options can be sold is $\$ 30$ . B, D, and $\mathrm { ~ F ~ }$ get their order completely filled at this price. A buys 500 options (out of its total bid for 3,000 options) at this price.  

# 16.8  

The options are valued using Black–Scholes–Merton with $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 4 0$ , $K = 4 0$ , $T = 5$ , $\sigma = 0 . 3$ and $r = 0 . 0 4$ . The value of each option is $\$ 13.585$ . The total expense reported is $5 0 0 , 0 0 0 \times \mathcal { N } 1 3 . 5 8 5$ or $\$ 6.792$ million.

The problem is that under the current rules the options are valued only once—on the grant date. Arguably, it would make sense to treat the options in the same way as other derivatives entered into by the company and revalue them on each reporting date. However, this does not happen under current accounting rules unless the options are settled in cash.  

# 16.10  

The expected life at time zero can be calculated by rolling back through the tree asking the question at each node: "What is the expected life if the node is reached?" This is what has been done in Figure S16.1. It is assumed that $5 \%$ of employees leave at times 2, 4, 6, and 8 years. For example, at node G (time 6 years) there is a $81 \%$ chance that the option will be exercised ( $80 \%$ chance that the holder chooses to exercise and a $5 \%$ times $20 \%$ chance that the holder chooses not to exercise but leaves the company after 6 years) and a $19 \%$ chance that it will last an extra two years. The expected life if node G is reached is therefore $0 . 8 1 \times 6 + 0 . 1 9 \times 8 = 6 . 3 8$ years. Similarly, the expected life if node H is reached is $0 . 3 3 5 \times 6 + 0 . 6 6 5 \times 8 = 7 . 3 3$ years. The expected life if node I or J is reached is $0 . 0 5 { \times } 6 + 0 . 9 5 { \times } 8 = 7 . 9 0$ years. The expected life if node D is reached is $0 . 4 3 \times 4 + 0 . 5 7 \times ( 0 . 5 1 5 8 \times 6 . 3 8 + 0 . 4 8 4 2 \times 7 . 3 3 ) = 5 . 6 2$  

Continuing in this way, the expected life at time zero is 6.76 years. (As in Example 16.2 we assume that no employees leave at time zero.)  

The value of the option assuming an expected life of 6.76 years is given by Black–Scholes– Merton with $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 4 0$ , $K = 4 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 5$ , $\sigma = 0 . 3$ and $T = 6 . 7 6$ . It is 17.04.

# 16.11  

The options are valued using Black–Scholes–Merton with $K = 6 0$ , $T = 6$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2 2$ , $r = 0 . 0 5$ . The present value of the dividends during the six years assumed life is  

$$
\times \mathtt { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } + 1 \times \mathtt { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 1 . 5 } + 1 \times \mathtt { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 2 . 5 } + 1 \times \mathtt { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 3 . 5 } + 1 \times \mathtt { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 4 . 5 } + 1 \times \mathtt { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 0 5 \times 5 . 5 } = 5 . 1 8 3
$$  

The stock price, $S _ { 0 }$ , adjusted for dividend is therefore $6 0 - 5 . 1 8 3 { = } 5 4 . 8 1 7$ . The Black–Scholes model gives the price of one option as $\$ 16.492$ . The company will therefore report as an expense $2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \times 1 6 , 4 9 2$ or $\$ 32.984$ million.  

# 16.12  

(a) Suppose that $K$ is the value of the fund at the beginning of the year and $S _ { T }$ is the net value of the fund at the end of the year (after fees and expenses). In addition to the management fee, the hedge fund earns  

$$
\alpha \operatorname* { m a x } ( S _ { \mathrm { { r } } } - K , 0 )
$$  

where $\alpha$ is a constant.  

This shows that a hedge fund manager has a call option on the net value of the fund at the end of the year. One parameter determining the value of the call option is the volatility of the fund. The fund manager has an incentive to make the fund as volatile as possible! This may not correspond with the desires of the investors. One way of making the fund highly volatile would be by investing only in high-beta stocks.  

Another would be by using the whole fund to buy call options on a market index.  

Amaranth provides an example of a hedge fund that took large speculative positions to maximize the value of its call options.  

It is interesting to note that the managers of the fund could personally take positions that are opposite to those taken by the fund to ensure a profit in all circumstances (although there is no evidence that they do this).  

(b) An executive who has a salary plus options has a remuneration package similar to that of the hedge fund.  The hedge fund's management fee corresponds to the executive's salary and the hedge fund's investments correspond to the stock on which the executive has options. In theory, granting the executive options encourages him/her to take risks so that volatility is increased in the same way that the hedge fund's remuneration package encourages it to take risks.  However, while examples such as Amaranth show that some hedge fund managers do take risks to increase the value of their option, it is less clear that executives behave similarly.

The lower bound is given by equation 17.1 as $3 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 5 } - 2 9 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 8 \times 0 . 5 } = 1 6 . 9 0$

A range forward contract allows a corporation to ensure that the exchange rate applicable to a transaction will not be worse than one exchange rate and will not be better than another exchange rate. In this case, a corporation would buy a put with the lower exchange rate and sell a call with the higher exchange rate.  

# 17.4  

In this case, $S _ { 0 } = 2 5 0 , K = 2 5 0 , r = 0 . 1 0 , \sigma = 0 . 1 8 , T = 0 . 2 5 , q = 0 . 0 3$ and  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 2 5 0 / 2 5 0 ) + ( 0 . 1 0 - 0 . 0 3 + 0 . 1 8 ^ { 2 } / 2 ) 0 . 2 5 } { 0 . 1 8 { \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } } } } = 0 . 2 3 9 4
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 1 8 { \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } } = 0 . 1 4 9 4

and the call price is

In this case, $S _ { 0 } = 0 . 5 2$ , $K = 0 . 5 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 4$ , $r _ { f } = 0 . 0 8$ , $\sigma = 0 . 1 2$ , $T = 0 . 6 6 6 7$ , and  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 0 . 5 2 / 0 . 5 0 ) + ( 0 . 0 4 - 0 . 0 8 + 0 . 1 2 ^ { 2 } / 2 ) 0 . 6 6 6 7 } { 0 . 1 2 { \sqrt { 0 . 6 6 6 7 } } } } = 0 . 1 7 7 1

A put option to sell one unit of currency A for $K$ units of currency $\mathbf { B }$ is worth  

$$
K e ^ { - r _ { B } T } N ( - d _ { 2 } ) - S _ { 0 } e ^ { - r _ { A } T } N ( - d _ { 1 } )
$$  

where  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( S _ { 0 } / K ) + ( r _ { B } - r _ { A } + \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) T } { \sigma { \sqrt { T } } } }
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = { \frac { \ln ( S _ { 0 } / K ) + ( r _ { _ B } - r _ { _ A } - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) T } { \sigma { \sqrt { T } } } }
$$  

and $r _ { \scriptscriptstyle A }$ and $r _ { B }$ are the risk-free rates in currencies A and B, respectively. The value of the option is measured in units of currency B. Defining $S _ { 0 } ^ { * } = 1 / S _ { 0 }$ and $K ^ { * } = 1 / K$  

$$
d _ { 1 } = \frac { - \ln ( S _ { 0 } ^ { * } / K ^ { * } ) - ( r _ { A } - r _ { B } - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) T } { \sigma \sqrt { T } }
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = { \frac { - \ln ( S _ { 0 } ^ { * } / K ^ { * } ) - ( r _ { A } - r _ { B } + \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) T } { \sigma { \sqrt { T } } } }
$$  

The put price is therefore  

$$
S _ { 0 } K [ S _ { 0 } ^ { * } e ^ { - r _ { B } T } N ( d _ { 1 } ^ { * } ) - K ^ { * } e ^ { - r _ { A } T } N ( d _ { 2 } ^ { * } )
$$  

where  

$$
d _ { 1 } ^ { * } = - d _ { 2 } = \frac { \ln ( S _ { 0 } ^ { * } / K ^ { * } ) + ( r _ { A } - r _ { B } + \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) T } { \sigma \sqrt { T } }
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } ^ { * } = - d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( S _ { 0 } ^ { * } / K ^ { * } ) + ( r _ { A } - r _ { B } - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) T } { \sigma { \sqrt { T } } } }
$$  

This shows that put option is equivalent to $K S _ { 0 }$ call options to buy 1 unit of currency A for $1 / K$ units of currency B. In this case, the value of the option is measured in units of currency A. To obtain the call option value in units of currency B (the same units as the value of the put option was measured in) we must divide by $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } }$ . This proves the result.  

# 17.7 Lower bound for European option is  

$$
S _ { 0 } e ^ { - r _ { f } T } - K e ^ { - r T } = 1 . 5 e ^ { - 0 . 0 9 \times 0 . 5 } - 1 . 4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } = 0 . 0 6 9
$$  

Lower bound for American option is  

$$
S _ { 0 } - K = 0 . 1 0
$$  

# 17.8  

In this case, $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 2 5 0$ , $\scriptstyle q = 0 . 0 4$ , $r = 0 . 0 6$ , $T = 0 . 2 5$ , $K = 2 4 5$ , and $c = 1 0$ . Using put–call parity  

$$
c + K e ^ { - r T } = p + S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T }
$$  

or  

$$
p = c + K e ^ { - r T } - S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T }
$$  

Substituting,  

$$
p = 1 0 + 2 4 5 e ^ { - 0 . 2 5 \times 0 . 0 6 } - 2 5 0 e ^ { - 0 . 2 5 \times 0 . 0 4 } = 3 . 8 4
$$  

The put price is 3.84.  

# 17.9  

In this case, $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 6 9 6$ , $K = 7 0 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 7$ , $\sigma = 0 . 3$ , $T = 0 . 2 5$ and $\scriptstyle q = 0 . 0 4$ . The option can be valued using equation (17.5).  

$$
{ \begin{array} { l } { d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 6 9 6 / 7 0 0 ) + ( 0 . 0 7 - 0 . 0 4 + 0 . 0 9 / 2 ) \times 0 . 2 5 } { 0 . 3 { \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } } } } = 0 . 0 8 6 8 } \\ { d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 3 { \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } } = - 0 . 0 6 3 2 } \end{array} }
$$  

and  

$$
N ( - d _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 4 6 5 4 , ~ N ( - d _ { 2 } ) = 0 . 5 2 5 2
$$  

The value of the put, $p$ , is given by:  

$$
p = 7 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 \times 0 . 2 5 } \times 0 . 5 2 5 2 - 6 9 6 e ^ { - 0 . 0 4 \times 0 . 2 5 } \times 0 . 4 6 5 4 = 4 0 . 6
$$  

that is, it is $\$ 40.6$ .  

# 17.10  

Following the hint, we first consider:   
Portfolio $A$ : A European call option plus an amount $K$ invested at the risk-free rate. Portfolio $B$ : An American put option plus $e ^ { - q T }$ of stock with dividends being reinvested in the stock.  

Portfolio A is worth $c + K$ while portfolio $\mathbf { B }$ is worth $P + S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T }$ . If the put option is exercised at time $\tau ( 0 \leq \tau < T )$ , portfolio B becomes:  

$$
K - S _ { \tau } + S _ { \tau } e ^ { - q ( T - \tau ) } \leq K
$$  

where $S _ { \tau }$ is the stock price at time $\tau$ . Portfolio A is worth  

$$
c + K e ^ { r \tau } \geq K
$$  

Hence, portfolio A is worth at least as much as portfolio B. If both portfolios are held to maturity (time $T$ ), portfolio A is worth  

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \operatorname* { m a x } ( S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } - K , 0 ) + K e ^ { r T } } \\ { = \operatorname* { m a x } ( S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } , K ) + K ( e ^ { r T } - 1 ) } \end{array}
$$  

Portfolio B is worth $\operatorname* { m a x } ( S _ { T } , K )$ . Hence portfolio A is worth more than portfolio B.  

Because portfolio A is worth at least as much as portfolio $\mathbf { B }$ in all circumstances  

$$
P + S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } \leq c + K
$$  

Because $c \leq C$ ,  

or  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { P + S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } \leq C + K } } \\ { { } } \\ { { S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } - K \leq C - P } } \end{array}
$$  

This proves the first part of the inequality.  

For the second part consider:  

Portfolio $C$ : An American call option plus an amount $K e ^ { - r T }$ invested at the risk-free rate. Portfolio $D$ : A European put option plus one stock with dividends being reinvested in the stock.  

Portfolio C is worth $C + K e ^ { - r T }$ while portfolio $\mathrm { \Delta D }$ is worth $p + S _ { 0 }$ . If the call option is exercised at time $\tau ( 0 \leq \tau < T )$ , portfolio C becomes:  

$$
S _ { \tau } - K + K e ^ { - r ( T - \tau ) } < S _ { \tau }
$$  

while portfolio D is worth  

$$
p + S _ { \tau } e ^ { q ( \tau - t ) } \geq S _ { \tau }
$$  

Hence, portfolio $\mathrm { ~ D ~ }$ is worth more than portfolio C. If both portfolios are held to maturity (time $T$ ), portfolio $\mathrm { \Delta C }$ is worth $\operatorname* { m a x } ( S _ { \boldsymbol { T } } , K )$ while portfolio $\mathrm { ~ D ~ }$ is worth  

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \operatorname* { m a x } ( K - S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } , 0 ) + S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } e ^ { q T } } \\ { = \operatorname* { m a x } ( S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } , K ) + S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } ( e ^ { q T } - 1 ) } \end{array}
$$  

Hence, portfolio $\mathrm { ~ D ~ }$ is worth at least as much as portfolio $\mathrm { ^ c }$ .  

Since portfolio $\mathrm { ~ D ~ }$ is worth at least as much as portfolio $\mathrm { \Delta C }$ in all circumstances:  

$$
C + K e ^ { - r T } \leq p + S _ { 0 }
$$  

Since $p { \le } P$ ,  

$$
C + K e ^ { - r T } \leq P + S _ { 0 }
$$  

or  

$$
C - P \le S _ { 0 } - K e ^ { - r T }
$$  

This proves the second part of the inequality. Hence,  

$$
S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } - K \le C - P \le S _ { 0 } - K e ^ { - r T }
$$  

# 17.11  

This follows from put–call parity and the relationship between the forward price, $F _ { 0 }$ , and the spot price, $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } }$ .  

$$
c + K e ^ { - r T } = p + S _ { 0 } e ^ { - r _ { f } T }
$$  

and  

$$
F _ { 0 } = S _ { 0 } e ^ { ( r - r _ { f } ) T }
$$  

so that  

$$
c + K e ^ { - r T } = p + F _ { 0 } e ^ { - r T }
$$  

If $K = F _ { 0 }$ this reduces to $c = p$ . The result that $c = p$ when $K = F _ { 0 }$ is true for options on all underlying assets, not just options on currencies. An at-the-money option is frequently defined as one where $K = F _ { 0 }$ (or $c = p$ ) rather than one where $K = S _ { 0 }$ .  

# 17.12  

The volatility of a stock index can be expected to be less than the volatility of a typical stock. This is because some risk (i.e., return uncertainty) is diversified away when a portfolio of stocks is created. In capital asset pricing model terminology, there exists systematic and unsystematic risk in the returns from an individual stock. However, in a stock index, unsystematic risk has been diversified away and only the systematic risk contributes to volatility.  

# 17.13  

The cost of portfolio insurance increases as the beta of the portfolio increases. This is because portfolio insurance involves the purchase of a put option on the portfolio. As beta increases, the volatility of the portfolio increases causing the cost of the put option to increase. When index options are used to provide portfolio insurance, both the number of options required and the strike price increase as beta increases.  

# 17.14  

If the value of the portfolio mirrors the value of the index, the index can be expected to have dropped by $10 \%$ when the value of the portfolio drops by $10 \%$ . Hence, when the value of the portfolio drops to $\$ 54$ million the value of the index can be expected to be 1,080. This indicates that put options with an exercise price of 1080 should be purchased. The options should be on:  

$$
\frac { 6 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 } { 1 2 0 0 } = \ S 5 0 , 0 0 0
$$  

times the index. Each option contract is for $\$ 100$ times the index. Hence, 500 contracts should be purchased.  

# 17.15  

When the value of the portfolio falls to $\$ 54$ million the holder of the portfolio makes a capital loss of $10 \%$ . After dividends are taken into account, the loss is $7 \%$ during the year. This is $12 \%$ below the risk-free interest rate. According to the capital asset pricing model, the expected excess return of the portfolio above the risk-free rate equals beta times the expected excess return of the market above the risk-free rate.  

Therefore, when the portfolio provides a return $12 \%$ below the risk-free interest rate, the market's expected return is $6 \%$ below the risk-free interest rate. As the index can be assumed to have a beta of 1.0, this is also the excess expected return (including dividends) from the index. The expected return from the index is therefore $- 1 \%$ per annum. Since the index provides a $3 \%$ per annum dividend yield, the expected movement in the index is $- 4 \%$ . Thus, when the portfolio's value is $\$ 54$ million, the expected value of the index is $0 . 9 6 \times 1 2 0 0 = 1 1 5 2$ . Hence, European put options should be purchased with an exercise price of 1152. Their maturity date should be in one year.  

The number of options required is twice the number required in Problem 17.14. This is because we wish to protect a portfolio which is twice as sensitive to changes in market conditions as the portfolio in Problem 17.14. Hence, options on $\$ 100,000$ (or 1,000 contracts) should be purchased. To check that the answer is correct, consider what happens when the value of the portfolio declines by $20 \%$ to $\$ 48$ million. The return including dividends is $- 1 7 \%$ . This is $22 \%$ less than the risk-free interest rate. The index can be expected to provide a return (including dividends) which is $11 \%$ less than the risk-free interest rate, that is, a return of $- 6 \%$ . The index can therefore be expected to drop by $9 \%$ to 1092. The payoff from the put options is $( 1 1 5 2 - 1 0 9 2 ) \times 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 = \mathbb { S } 6$ million. This is exactly what is required to restore the value of the portfolio to $\$ 54$ million.  

# 17.16  

The implied dividend yield is the value of $q$ that satisfies the put–call parity equation. It is the value of $q$ that solves  

$$
1 5 4 + 1 4 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } = 3 4 . 2 5 + 1 5 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 5 q }
$$  

This is $1 . 9 9 \%$ .  

# 17.17  

A total return index behaves like a stock paying no dividends. In a risk-neutral world, it can be expected to grow on average at the risk-free rate. Forward contracts and options on total return indices should be valued in the same way as forward contracts and options on nondividend-paying stocks.  

# 17.18  

The put–call parity relationship for European currency options is  

$$
c + K e ^ { - r T } = p + S e ^ { - r _ { f } T }
$$  

To prove this result, the two portfolios to consider are:  

Portfolio A: One call option plus one discount bond which will be worth $K$ at time $T .$  

Portfolio $B$ : One put option plus $e ^ { - r _ { f } T }$ of foreign currency invested at the foreign risk-free interest rate.  

Both portfolios are worth $\operatorname* { m a x } ( S _ { \boldsymbol { T } } , K )$ at time $T$ . They must therefore be worth the same today. The result follows.  

# 17.19  

In portfolio A, the cash, if it is invested at the risk-free interest rate, will grow to $K$ at time $T$ . If $S _ { T } > K$ , the call option is exercised at time $T$ and portfolio A is worth $S _ { T }$ . If $S _ { T } < K$  the call option expires worthless and the portfolio is worth $K$ . Hence, at time $T _ { \cdot }$ portfolio A is worth  

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } { ( S _ { T } , K ) }
$$  

Because of the reinvestment of dividends, portfolio B becomes one share at time $T$ . It is, therefore, worth $S _ { T }$ at this time. It follows that portfolio A is always worth as much as, and is sometimes worth more than, portfolio B at time $T$ . In the absence of arbitrage opportunities, this must also be true today. Hence,  

$$
c + K e ^ { - r T } \geq S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T }
$$  

or  

$$
c \geq S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } - K e ^ { - r T }
$$  

This proves equation (17.1).  

In portfolio C, the reinvestment of dividends means that the portfolio is one put option plus one share at time $T _ { \mathbf { \delta } }$ If $S _ { T } < K$ , the put option is exercised at time $T$ and portfolio C is worth $K$ . If $S _ { T } > K$  the put option expires worthless and the portfolio is worth $S _ { T }$ . Hence, at time $T$ , portfolio $\mathrm { \Delta C }$ is worth  

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } { ( S _ { T } , K ) }
$$  

Portfolio D is worth $K$ at time $T$ . It follows that portfolio $\mathrm { \Delta C }$ is always worth as much as, and is sometimes worth more than, portfolio $\mathrm { ~ D ~ }$ at time $T$ . In the absence of arbitrage  

opportunities, this must also be true today. Hence,  

or  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { p + S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } \geq K e ^ { - r T } } } \\ { { { } } } \\ { { p \geq K e ^ { - r T } - S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } } } \end{array}
$$  

This proves equation (17.2).  

Portfolios A and C are both worth max $( S _ { \cal T } , K )$ at time $T .$ . They must, therefore, be worth the same today, and the put–call parity result in equation (17.3) follows.  

# 17.20  

There is no way of doing this. A natural idea is to create an option to exchange $K$ euros for one yen from an option to exchange $Y$ dollars for 1 yen and an option to exchange $K$ euros for $Y$ dollars. The problem with this is that it assumes that either both options are exercised or that neither option is exercised. There are always some circumstances where the first option is in-the-money at expiration while the second is not and vice versa.  

# 17.21  

We assume the time to maturity is 0.1667 years. We set the asset price and strike price equal to 270, the risk-free rate equal to $0 . 2 5 \%$ , the dividend yield equal to $2 \%$ and the call option price equal to 5.35.  DerivaGem gives the implied volatility as $1 3 . 0 7 \%$ .  

From put call parity (equation 17.3) the price of the put, $p$ , is given by $5 . 3 5 + 2 7 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 0 2 5 \times 0 . 1 6 6 7 } = p + 2 7 0 ^ { - 0 . 0 2 \times 0 . 1 6 6 7 }$  

so that $\scriptstyle { p = 6 . 1 4 }$ . DerivaGem shows that the implied volatility is $1 3 . 0 7 \%$ (as for the call). A European call has the same implied volatility as a European put when both have the same strike price and time to maturity. This is formally proved in Chapter 20.  

# 17.22  

(a) The price is 14.39 as indicated by the tree in Figure S17.2.

In this case, $S _ { 0 } { = } 0 . 7 5$ , $K { = } 0 . 7 5$ , $r = 0 . 0 5$ , $r _ { f } = 0 . 0 4$ , $\sigma = 0 . 0 8$ and $T = 0 . 7 5$ . The option can be valued using equation (17.8)  

$$
d _ { 1 } = 0 . 1 4 2 9 , d _ { 2 } = 0 . 0 7 3 6
$$  

and  

$$
N ( d _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 5 5 6 8 , N ( d _ { 2 } ) = 0 . 5 2 9 3
$$  

The value of the call, $c$ , is given by  

$$
c = 0 . 7 5 e ^ { - 0 . 0 4 \times 0 . 7 5 } \times 0 . 5 5 6 8 - 0 . 7 5 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 7 5 } \times 0 . 5 2 9 3 = 0 . 0 2 2 9
$$  

that is, it is 2.29 cents. From put–call parity  

$$
p + S _ { 0 } e ^ { - r _ { f } T } = c + K e ^ { - r T }
$$  

so that  

$$
p = 0 . 0 2 2 9 + 0 . 7 5 \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 7 5 } - 0 . 7 5 \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 4 \times 0 . 7 5 } = 0 . 0 1 7 4
$$  

The option to buy $\mathrm { U S S 0 . 7 5 }$ with $\mathrm { C S 1 . 0 0 }$ is the same as the same as an option to sell one Canadian dollar for US\$0.75. This means that it is a put option on the Canadian dollar and its price is US\$0.0174 or 1.74 cents.  

# 17.24  

(a) From the formula at the end of Section 17.4  

$$
q = - { \frac { 1 } { 0 . 2 5 } } \ln { \frac { 7 8 - 2 6 + 9 5 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 4 \times 0 . 2 5 } } { 1 0 0 0 } } = 0 . 0 2 9 9
$$  

The dividend yield is $2 . 9 9 \%$ .  

(b) We can calculate the implied volatility using either the call or the put. The answer (given by DerivaGem) is $2 4 . 6 8 \%$ in both cases.  

# 17.25  

The price of currency B expressed in terms of currency A is $1 / S$ . From Ito's lemma, the process followed by $X = 1 / S$ is  

$$
d X = [ ( r _ { \mathrm { { B } } } - r _ { \mathrm { { A } } } ) S \times ( - 1 / S ^ { 2 } ) + 0 . 5 \sigma ^ { 2 } S ^ { 2 } \times ( 2 / S ^ { 3 } ) ] d t + \sigma S \times ( - 1 / S ^ { 2 } ) d z
$$  

or  

$$
d X = [ r _ { \mathrm { { A } } } - r _ { \mathrm { { B } } } + \sigma ^ { 2 } ] X d t - \sigma X d z
$$  

Symmetry arguments would suggest that it should be  

$$
d X = [ r _ { A } - r _ { B } ] X d t - \sigma X d z
$$  

This is Siegel's paradox and is discussed further in Business Snapshot 30.1.  

# 17.26  

In this case, the guarantee is valued as a put option with $S _ { 0 } = 1 \mathrm { , 0 0 0 }$ , $K = 1 , 0 0 0$ , $r = 5 \%$ , $q =$ $1 \%$ , $\sigma = 1 5 \%$ , and ${ \cal T } { = } 1 0$ . The value of the guarantee is given by equation (17.5) as 38.46 or $3 . 8 \%$ of the value of the portfolio.  

# CHAPTER 18 Futures Options and Black's Model

# 18.1  

In this case, $u = 1 . 1 2$ and $d = 0 . 9 2$ . The probability of an up movement in a risk-neutral world is  

$$
\frac { 1 - 0 . 9 2 } { 1 . 1 2 - 0 . 9 2 } = 0 . 4
$$  

From risk-neutral valuation, the value of the call is  

$$
e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 \times 0 . 5 } ( 0 . 4 { \times } 6 + 0 . 6 { \times } 0 ) { = } 2 . 3 3
$$  

# 18.2  

The American futures call option is worth more than the corresponding American option on the underlying asset when the futures price is greater than the spot price prior to the maturity of the futures contract. This is the case when the risk-free rate is greater than the income on the asset plus the convenience yield.  

# 18.3  

In this case, $F _ { 0 } = 1 9$ , $K = 2 0$ , $r = 0 . 1 2$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2 0$ , and $T = 0 . 4 1 6 7$ . The value of the European futures put option is  

$$
2 0 N ( - d _ { 2 } ) e ^ { - 0 . 1 2 \times 0 . 4 1 6 7 } - 1 9 N ( - d _ { 1 } ) e ^ { - 0 . 1 2 \times 0 . 4 1 6 7 }
$$  

where  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 1 9 / 2 0 ) + ( 0 . 0 4 / 2 ) 0 . 4 1 6 7 } { 0 . 2 { \sqrt { 0 . 4 1 6 7 } } } } = - 0 . 3 3 2 7
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 2 \sqrt { 0 . 4 1 6 7 } = - 0 . 4 6 1 8
$$  

This is  

$$
e ^ { - 0 . 1 2 \times 0 . 4 1 6 7 } [ 2 0 N ( 0 . 4 6 1 8 ) - 1 9 N ( 0 . 3 3 2 7 ) ]
$$  

$$
= e ^ { - 0 . 1 2 \times 0 . 4 1 6 7 } ( 2 0 \times 0 . 6 7 7 8 - 1 9 \times 0 . 6 3 0 3 )
$$  

or $\$ 1.50$ .  

# 18.4  

An amount $( 1 , 4 0 0 - 1 , 3 8 0 ) \times 1 0 0 = \ S 2 , 0 0 0$ is added to your margin account and you acquire a short futures position obligating you to sell 100 ounces of gold in October. This position is marked to market in the usual way until you choose to close it out.  

# 18.5  

In this case, an amount $( 1 . 3 5 - 1 . 3 0 ) \times 4 0 , 0 0 0 = \ S 2 , 0 0 0$ is subtracted from your margin  

account and you acquire a short position in a live cattle futures contract to sell 40,000 pounds of cattle in April. This position is marked to market in the usual way until you choose to close it out.  

# 18.6  

Lower bound if option is European is  

$$
( F _ { 0 } - K ) e ^ { - r T } = ( 4 7 - 4 0 ) e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 2 / 1 2 } = 6 . 8 8
$$  

Lower bound if option is American is  

$$
F _ { 0 } - K = 7
$$

$$  

Lower bound if option is American is  

$$
K - F _ { 0 } = 3
$$  

# 18.8  

In this case, $u = e ^ { 0 . 3 \times \sqrt { 1 / 4 } } = 1 . 1 6 1 8$ ; $d = 1 / u = 0 . 8 6 0 7$ ; and  

$$
p = { \frac { 1 - 0 . 8 6 0 7 } { 1 . 1 6 1 8 - 0 . 8 6 0 7 } } = 0 . 4 6 2 6
$$  

In the tree shown in Figure S18.1, the middle number at each node is the price of the European option and the lower number is the price of the American option. The tree shows that the value of the European option is 4.3155 and the value of the American option is 4.4026. The American option should sometimes be exercised early.

Figure S18.1:  Tree to evaluate European and American call options in Problem 18.8  

# 18.9  

The parameters $u , d$ and $p$ are the same as in Problem 18.8. The tree in Figure S18.2 shows that the prices of the European and American put options are the same as those calculated for call options in Problem 18.8. This illustrates a symmetry that exists for at-the-money futures options. The American option should sometimes be exercised early. Because $K = F _ { 0 }$ and $c = p$ , the European put–call parity result holds.  

$$
c + K e ^ { - r T } = p + F _ { 0 } e ^ { - r T }
$$  

Also, because $C = P$ , $F _ { 0 } e ^ { - r T } < K$ , and $K e ^ { - r T } < F _ { 0 }$ the result in equation (18.2) holds. (The  

first expression in equation (18.2) is negative; the middle expression is zero, and the last expression is positive.)

In this case, $F _ { 0 } = 2 5 , K = 2 6 , \sigma = 0 . 3 , r = 0 . 1 , T = 0 . 7 5$  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( F _ { 0 } / K ) + \sigma ^ { 2 } T / 2 } { \sigma { \sqrt { T } } } } = - 0 . 0 2 1 1
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = { \frac { \ln ( F _ { 0 } / K ) - \sigma ^ { 2 } T / 2 } { \sigma { \sqrt { T } } } } = - 0 . 2 8 0 9
$$  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { c = e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 5 } [ 2 5 N ( - 0 . 0 2 1 1 ) - 2 6 N ( - 0 . 2 8 0 9 ) ] } } \\ { { } } \\ { { = e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 5 } [ 2 5 \times 0 . 4 9 1 6 - 2 6 \times 0 . 3 8 9 4 ] = 2 . 0 1 } } \end{array}
$$  

# 18.11  

In this case, $F _ { 0 } = 7 0$ , $K = 6 5$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2$ , r  006 , T  04167  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( F _ { 0 } / K ) + \sigma ^ { 2 } T / 2 } { \sigma { \sqrt { T } } } } = 0 . 6 3 8 6
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = { \frac { \ln ( F _ { 0 } / K ) - \sigma ^ { 2 } T / 2 } { \sigma { \sqrt { T } } } } = 0 . 5 0 9 5
$$  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { p = e ^ { - 0 . 0 2 5 } [ 6 5 N ( - 0 . 5 0 9 5 ) - 7 0 N ( - 0 . 6 3 8 6 ) ] } \\ { { } } \\ { = e ^ { - 0 . 0 2 5 } [ 6 5 \times 0 . 3 0 5 2 - 7 0 \times 0 . 2 6 1 5 ] = 1 . 4 9 5 } \end{array}
$$  

In this case,  

$$
c + K e ^ { - r T } = 2 + 3 4 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 1 } = 3 2 . 7 6
$$  

$$
p + F _ { 0 } e ^ { - r T } = 2 + 3 5 e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 1 } = 3 3 . 6 7
$$  

Put–call parity shows that we should buy one call, short one put and short a futures contract. This costs nothing up front. In one year, either we exercise the call or the put is exercised against us. In either case, we buy the asset for 34 and close out the futures position. The gain on the short futures position is $3 5 - 3 4 = 1$ .  

# 18.13  

The put price is  

$$
e ^ { - r T } [ K N ( - d _ { 2 } ) - F _ { 0 } N ( - d _ { 1 } ) ]
$$  

Because $N ( - x ) = 1 - N ( x )$ for all $x$ the put price can also be written  

$$
e ^ { - r T } [ K - K N ( d _ { 2 } ) - F _ { 0 } + F _ { 0 } N ( d _ { 1 } ) ]
$$  

Because $F _ { 0 } = K$ this is the same as the call price:  

$$
e ^ { - r T } [ F _ { 0 } N ( d _ { 1 } ) - K N ( d _ { 2 } ) ]
$$  

This result also follows from put–call parity showing that it is not model dependent.  

# 18.14  

From equation (18.2), $C - P$ must lie between  

$$
3 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 3 / 1 2 } - 2 8 = 1 . 6 3
$$  

and  

$$
3 0 - 2 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 3 / 1 2 } = 2 . 3 5
$$  

Because $C = 4$ we must have $1 . 6 3 < 4 - P < 2 . 3 5$ or  

$$
1 . 6 5 < P < 2 . 3 7
$$  

# 18.15  

In this case, we consider:  

Portfolio $A$ : A European call option on futures plus an amount $K$ invested at the risk-free interest rate.  

Portfolio $B$ : An American put option on futures plus an amount $F _ { 0 } e ^ { - r T }$ invested at the riskfree interest rate plus a long futures contract maturing at time $T _ { \mathbf { \delta } }$ .  

Following the arguments in Chapter 5, we will treat all futures contracts as forward contr Portfolio A is worth $c + K$ while portfolio $\mathbf { B }$ is worth $P + F _ { 0 } e ^ { - r T }$ . If the put option is exercised at time $\tau ( 0 \leq \tau < T )$ , portfolio $\mathbf { B }$ is worth  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { K { - } F _ { \tau } + F _ { 0 } e ^ { - r ( T - \tau ) } + F _ { \tau } - F _ { 0 } } } \\ { { = K { + } F _ { 0 } e ^ { - r ( T - \tau ) } { - } F _ { 0 } { < } K } } \end{array}
$$  

at time $\tau$ where $F _ { \tau }$ is the futures price at time $\tau$ . Portfolio $\mathrm { A }$ is worth  

$$
c + K e ^ { r \tau } \geq K
$$  

Hence, Portfolio A more than Portfolio B.  If both portfolios are held to maturity (time $T$ ), Portfolio A is worth  

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \operatorname* { m a x } ( F _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } - K , 0 ) + K e ^ { r T } } \\ { = \operatorname* { m a x } ( F _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } , K ) + K ( e ^ { r T } - 1 ) } \end{array}
$$  

Portfolio B is worth  

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } ( K - F _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } , 0 ) + F _ { 0 } + F _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } - F _ { 0 } = \operatorname* { m a x } ( F _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } , K )
$$  

Hence, portfolio A is worth more than portfolio B. Because portfolio A is worth more than portfolio B in all circumstances:  

$$
P + F _ { 0 } e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } < c + K
$$  

Because $c \leq C$ it follows that  

or  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { P + F _ { 0 } e ^ { - r T } < C + K } } \\ { { { } } } \\ { { F _ { 0 } e ^ { - r T } - K < C - P } } \end{array}
$$  

This proves the first part of the inequality.  

For the second part of the inequality consider:  

Portfolio $C$ : An American call futures option plus an amount $K e ^ { - r T }$ invested at the risk-free interest rate.  

Portfolio $D$ : A European put futures option plus an amount $F _ { 0 }$ invested at the risk-free interest rate plus a long futures contract.  

Portfolio C is worth $C + K e ^ { - r T }$ while portfolio $\mathrm { ~ D ~ }$ is worth $p + F _ { 0 }$ . If the call option is exercised at time $\tau ( 0 \leq \tau < T )$ portfolio C becomes:  

$$
F _ { \tau } - K + K e ^ { - r ( T - \tau ) } < F _ { \tau }
$$  

while portfolio D is worth  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { p + F _ { 0 } e ^ { r \tau } + F _ { \tau } - F _ { 0 } } } \\ { { = p + F _ { 0 } ( e ^ { r \tau } - 1 ) + F _ { \tau } { \geq } F _ { \tau } } } \end{array}
$$  

Hence, portfolio $\mathrm { ~ D ~ }$ is worth more than portfolio C. If both portfolios are held to maturity (time $T$ ), portfolio $\mathrm { \Delta C }$ is worth $\operatorname* { m a x } ( F _ { T } , K )$ while portfolio $\mathrm { ~ D ~ }$ is worth  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \quad \operatorname* { m a x } ( K - F _ { T } , 0 ) + F _ { 0 } e ^ { r T } + F _ { T } - F _ { 0 } } \\ & { = \operatorname* { m a x } ( K , F _ { T } ) + F _ { 0 } ( e ^ { r T } - 1 ) } \\ & { > \operatorname* { m a x } ( K , F _ { T } ) } \end{array}
$$  

Hence portfolio $\mathrm { ~ D ~ }$ is worth more than portfolio C.  

Because portfolio D is worth more than portfolio $\mathrm { \Delta C }$ in all circumstances  

$$
C + K e ^ { - r T } < p + F _ { 0 }
$$  

Because $p \leq P$ it follows that  

$$
C + K e ^ { - r T } < P + F _ { 0 }
$$  

or  

$$
C - P < F _ { 0 } { - } K e ^ { - r T }
$$  

This proves the second part of the inequality. The result:  

$$
F _ { 0 } e ^ { - r T } - K < C - P < F _ { 0 } - K e ^ { - r T }
$$  

has therefore been proved.  

# 18.16  

This has the same value as a three-month call option on silver futures where the futures contract expires in three months. It can therefore be valued using equation (18.7) with $F _ { 0 } = 1 2$ , $K = 1 3$ , $r = 0 . 0 4$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2 5$ and $T = 0 . 2 5$ . The value is 0.244.  

# 18.17  

The rate received will be less than $6 . 5 \%$ when LIBOR is less than $7 \%$ . The corporation requires a three-month call option on a Eurodollar futures option with a strike price of 93. If three-month LIBOR is greater than $7 \%$ at the option maturity, the Eurodollar futures quote at option maturity will be less than 93 and there will be no payoff from the option. If the threemonth LIBOR is less than $7 \%$ , one Eurodollar futures options provide a payoff of $\$ 25$ per $0 . 0 1 \%$ . Each $0 . 0 1 \%$ of interest costs the corporation $\$ 125$ $2 5 ( = 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \times 0 . 0 0 0 1 \times 0 . 2 5 )$ . A total of $1 2 5 / 2 5 = 5$ contracts are therefore required.  

# 18.18  

In this case, $u = 1 . 1 2 5$ and $d = 0 . 8 7 5$ . The risk-neutral probability of an up move is $\left( 1 - . 8 7 5 \right) / \left( 1 . 1 2 5 - 0 . 8 7 5 \right) = 0 . 5$  

The value of the option is  

$$
e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 \times 0 . 2 5 } [ 0 . 5 \times 3 + 0 . 5 \times 0 ] = 1 . 4 7 4
$$  

# 18.19  

Put–call parity for European options gives  

$$
{ \bf \dot { 6 } } . 5 + 7 8 e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 5 } = ~ c + 8 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 5 }
$$  

so that $c = 4 . 5 3$ .  

The relation for American options gives  

$$
7 8 \ \hat { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 5 } - 8 0 < C - 6 . 5 < 7 8 - 8 0 \ e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 5 }
$$  

so that  

$$
- 3 . 1 6 < \ C - 6 . 5 < - 0 . 8 1
$$  

so that $C$ lies between 3.34 and 5.69.  

# 18.20  

$u = 1 . 3 3 1$ , $d = 0 . 8 8 2 5$ , and $ { p } = 0 . 4 6 8 8$ . As the tree in Figure S18.3 shows the value of the option is 4.59.

There are 135 days to maturity (assuming this is not a leap year). Using DerivaGem with $F _ { 0 } = 2 7 8 . 2 5$ , $r = 1 . 1 \%$ , $T = 1 3 5 / 3 6 5$ , and 500 time steps gives the implied volatilities shown in the table below.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>StrikePrice</td><td>Call Price</td><td>Put Price</td><td>Call Implied Vol</td><td>Put Implied Vol</td></tr><tr><td>260</td><td>26.75</td><td>8.50</td><td>24.69</td><td>24.59</td></tr><tr><td>270</td><td>21.25</td><td>13.50</td><td>25.40</td><td>26.14</td></tr><tr><td>280</td><td>17.25</td><td>19.00</td><td>26.85</td><td>26.86</td></tr><tr><td>290</td><td>14.00</td><td>25.625</td><td>28.11</td><td>27.98</td></tr><tr><td>300</td><td>11.375</td><td>32.625</td><td>29.24</td><td>28.57</td></tr></table></body></html>  

We do not expect put–call parity to hold exactly for American options and so there is no reason why the implied volatility of a call should be exactly the same as the implied volatility of a put. Nevertheless it is reassuring that they are close.  

There is a tendency for high strike price options to have a higher implied volatility. As explained in Chapter 20, this is an indication that the probability distribution for corn futures prices in the future has a heavier right tail and less heavy left tail than the lognormal distribution.  

# 18.22  

In this case, $F _ { 0 } = 5 2 5$ , $K = 5 2 5$ , $r = 0 . 0 6$ , $T = 0 . 4 1 6 7$ . We wish to find the value of $\sigma$ for which $p = 2 0$ where  

$$
p = K e ^ { - r T } N ( - d _ { 2 } ) - F _ { 0 } e ^ { - r T } N ( - d _ { 1 } )
$$  

This must be done by trial and error. When $\sigma = 0 . 2 , p = 2 6 . 3 5$ . When $\sigma = 0 . 1 5$ , $p = 1 9 . 7 7$ When $\sigma = 0 . 1 5 5$ , $p = 2 0 . 4 3$ . When $\sigma = 0 . 1 5 2$ , $p = 2 0 . 0 3$ . These calculations show that the implied volatility is approximately $1 5 . 2 \%$ per annum.  

# 18.23  

The price of the option is the same as the price of a European put option on the forward price of the index where the forward contract has a maturity of six months. It is given by equation (18.8) with $F _ { 0 } = 1 4 0 0$ , $K = 1 4 5 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 5$ , $\sigma = 0 . 1 5$ , and $T = 0 . 5$ . It is 86.35.

# Practice Questions  

19.1   
A short position in 1,000 options has a delta of $- 7 0 0$ and can be made delta neutral with the purchase of 700 shares.  

# 19.2  

In this case, $S _ { 0 } = K$ , $r = 0 . 1$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2 5$ , and $T = 0 . 5$ . Also,  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( S _ { 0 } / K ) + ( 0 . 1 + 0 . 2 5 ^ { 2 } / 2 ) 0 . 5 } { 0 . 2 5 { \sqrt { 0 . 5 } } } } = 0 . 3 7 1 2
$$  

The delta of the option is $N ( d _ { 1 } )$ or 0.64.  

# 19.3  

To hedge an option position, it is necessary to create the opposite option position synthetically. For example, to hedge a long position in a put, it is necessary to create a short position in a put synthetically. It follows that the procedure for creating an option position synthetically is the reverse of the procedure for hedging the option position.  

# 19.4  

The strategy costs the trader 0 10 each time the stock is bought or sold. The total expected cost of the strategy, in present value terms, must be $\$ 4$ . This means that the expected number of times the stock will be bought or sold is approximately 40. The expected number of times it will be bought is approximately 20 and the expected number of times it will be sold is also approximately 20. The buy and sell transactions can take place at any time during the life of the option. The above numbers are therefore only approximately correct because of the effects of discounting. Also, the estimate is of the number of times the stock is bought or sold in the risk-neutral world, not the real world.  

# 19.5  

The holding of the stock at any given time must be $N ( d _ { 1 } )$ . Hence, the stock is bought just after the price has risen and sold just after the price has fallen. (This is the buy high sell low strategy referred to in the text.) In the first scenario, the stock is continually bought. In the second scenario, the stock is bought, sold, bought again, sold again, etc. The final holding is the same in both scenarios. The buy, sell, buy, sell… situation clearly leads to higher costs than the buy, buy, buy… situation. This problem emphasizes one disadvantage of creating options synthetically. Whereas the cost of an option that is purchased is known up front and depends on the forecasted volatility, the cost of an option that is created synthetically is not known up front and depends on the volatility actually encountered.  

# 19.6  

The delta of a European futures call option is usually defined as the rate of change of the option price with respect to the futures price (not the spot price). It is  

$$
e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 1 } )
$$  

In this case, $F _ { 0 } = 8 , K = 8 , r = 0 . 1 2 , \sigma = 0 . 1 8 , T = 0 . 6 6 6 7$  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 8 / 8 ) + ( 0 . 1 8 ^ { 2 } / 2 ) \times 0 . 6 6 6 7 } { 0 . 1 8 { \sqrt { 0 . 6 6 6 7 } } } } = 0 . 0 7 3 5
$$  

$N ( d _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 5 2 9 3$ and the delta of the option is  

$$
e ^ { - 0 . 1 2 \times 0 . 6 6 6 7 } \times 0 . 5 2 9 3 = 0 . 4 8 8 6
$$  

The delta of a short position in 1,000 futures options is therefore 4886 .  

# 19.7  

In order to answer this problem, it is important to distinguish between the rate of change of the option with respect to the futures price and the rate of change of its price with respect to the spot price.  

The former will be referred to as the futures delta; the latter will be referred to as the spot delta. The futures delta of a nine-month futures contract to buy one ounce of silver is by definition 1.0. Hence, from the answer to Problem 19.6, a long position in nine-month futures on 488.6 ounces is necessary to hedge the option position.  

The spot delta of a nine-month futures contract is $e ^ { 0 . 1 2 \times 0 . 7 5 } = 1 . 0 9 4$ assuming no storage costs. (This is because silver can be treated in the same way as a non-dividend-paying stock when there are no storage costs. $F _ { 0 } = S _ { 0 } e ^ { r T }$ so that the spot delta is the futures delta times $e ^ { r T }$ ) Hence, the spot delta of the option position is $- 4 8 8 . 6 { \times } 1 . 0 9 4 = - 5 3 4 . 6$ . Thus, a long position in 534.6 ounces of silver is necessary to hedge the option position.  

The spot delta of a one-year silver futures contract to buy one ounce of silver is $e ^ { 0 . 1 2 } = 1 . 1 2 7 5$ . Hence, a long position in $e ^ { - 0 . 1 2 } \times 5 3 4 . 6 = 4 7 4 . 1$ ounces of one-year silver futures is necessary to hedge the option position.  

# 19.8  

A long position in either a put or a call option has a positive gamma. From Figure 19.8, when gamma is positive, the hedger gains from a large change in the stock price and loses from a small change in the stock price. Hence the hedger will fare better in case (b).  

# 19.9  

A short position in either a put or a call option has a negative gamma. From Figure 19.8, when gamma is negative, the hedger gains from a small change in the stock price and loses from a large change in the stock price. Hence, the hedger will fare better in case (a).  

# 19.10  

In this case, $S _ { 0 } = 0 . 8 0 , K = 0 . 8 1 , r = 0 . 0 8 , r _ { f } = 0 . 0 5 , \sigma = 0 . 1 5 , T = 0 . 5 8 3 3$  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 0 . 8 0 \mid 0 . 8 1 ) + \left( 0 . 0 8 - 0 . 0 5 + 0 . 1 5 ^ { 2 } / 2 \right) \times 0 . 5 8 3 3 } { 0 . 1 5 { \sqrt { 0 . 5 8 3 3 } } } } = 0 . 1 0 1 6
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 1 5 { \sqrt { 0 . 5 8 3 3 } } = - 0 . 0 1 3 0
$$  

$$
N ( d _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 5 4 0 5 ; N ( d _ { 2 } ) = 0 . 4 9 4 8
$$  

The delta of one call option is $e ^ { - r _ { f } T } N ( d _ { 1 } ) = e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 8 3 3 } \times 0 . 5 4 0 5 = 0 . 5 2 5 0 .$  

$$
N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) = \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 \pi } } e ^ { - d _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } / 2 } = \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 \pi } } e ^ { - 0 . 0 0 5 1 6 } = 0 . 3 9 6 9
$$  

so that the gamma of one call option is  

$$
\frac { N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) e ^ { - r _ { f } T } } { S _ { 0 } \sigma \sqrt { T } } = \frac { 0 . 3 9 6 9 \times 0 . 9 7 1 3 } { 0 . 8 0 \times 0 . 1 5 \times \sqrt { 0 . 5 8 3 3 } } = 4 . 2 0 6
$$  

The vega of one call option is  

$$
S _ { \circ } \sqrt { T } N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) e ^ { - r _ { f } T } = 0 . 8 0 \sqrt { 0 . 5 8 3 3 } \times 0 . 3 9 6 9 \times 0 . 9 7 1 3 = 0 . 2 3 5 5
$$  

The theta of one call option is  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { - \displaystyle \frac { S _ { 0 } N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \sigma e ^ { - r _ { f } T } } { 2 \sqrt { T } } + r _ { f } S _ { 0 } N ( d _ { 1 } ) e ^ { - r _ { f } T } - r K e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } ) } } \\ { { = - \displaystyle \frac { 0 . 8 \times 0 . 3 9 6 9 \times 0 . 1 5 \times 0 . 9 7 1 3 } { 2 \sqrt { 0 . 5 8 3 3 } } } } \\ { { + 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 8 \times 0 . 5 4 0 5 \times 0 . 9 7 1 3 - 0 . 0 8 \times 0 . 8 1 \times 0 . 9 5 4 4 \times 0 . 4 9 4 8 } } \\ { { = - 0 . 0 3 9 9 } } \end{array}
$$  

The rho of one call option is  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { K T e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } ) } \\ & { = 0 . 8 1 \times 0 . 5 8 3 3 \times 0 . 9 5 4 4 \times 0 . 4 9 4 8 } \\ & { = 0 . 2 2 3 1 } \end{array}
$$  

Delta can be interpreted as meaning that, when the spot price increases by a small amount (measured in cents), the value of an option to buy one yen increases by 0.525 times that amount. Gamma can be interpreted as meaning that, when the spot price increases by a small amount (measured in cents), the delta increases by 4.206 times that amount. Vega can be interpreted as meaning that, when the volatility (measured in decimal form) increases by a small amount, the option's value increases by 0.2355 times that amount. When volatility increases by $1 \% ( = 0 . 0 1 )$ , the option price increases by 0.002355. Theta can be interpreted as meaning that, when a small amount of time (measured in years) passes, the option's value decreases by 0.0399 times that amount. In particular, when one calendar day passes, it decreases by $0 . 0 3 9 9 / 3 6 5 = 0 . 0 0 0 1 0 9$ . Finally, rho can be interpreted as meaning that, when the interest rate (measured in decimal form) increases by a small amount, the option's value increases by 0.2231 times that amount. When the interest rate increases by $1 \%$ $\% ( = 0 . 0 1 )$ , the options value increases by 0.002231.  

# 19.11  

Assume that $S _ { 0 } , K , r , \sigma , T , q$ are the parameters for the option held and $S _ { 0 } , K ^ { * } , r , \sigma _ { ; }$ $T ^ { * }$ , $q$ are the parameters for another option. Suppose that $d _ { \mathrm { { 1 } } }$ has its usual meaning and is calculated on the basis of the first set of parameters while $\boldsymbol { d } _ { 1 } ^ { * }$ is the value of $d _ { \mathrm { { 1 } } }$ calculated on the basis of the second set of parameters. Suppose further that $w$ of the second option are held for each of the first option held. The gamma of the portfolio is:  

$$
\alpha \Bigg [ \frac { N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) e ^ { - q T } } { S _ { 0 } \sigma \sqrt { T } } + w \frac { N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ^ { * } ) e ^ { - q T ^ { * } } } { S _ { 0 } \sigma \sqrt { T ^ { * } } } \Bigg ]
$$  

where $\alpha$ is the number of the first option held. Since we require gamma to be zero,  

$$
w = - \frac { N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) e ^ { - q ( T - T ^ { * } ) } } { N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ^ { * } ) } \sqrt { \frac { T ^ { * } } { T } }
$$  

The vega of the portfolio is  

$$
\alpha \Big [ S _ { 0 } \sqrt { T } N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) e ^ { - q ( T ) } + w S _ { 0 } \sqrt { T ^ { * } } N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ^ { * } ) e ^ { - q ( T ^ { * } ) } \Big ]
$$  

Since we require vega to be zero,  

$$
w = - \sqrt { \frac { T } { T ^ { * } } } \frac { N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) e ^ { - q ( T - T ^ { * } ) } } { N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ^ { * } ) }
$$  

Equating the two expressions for $w$  

$$
{ \boldsymbol { T } } ^ { * } = { \boldsymbol { T } }
$$  

Hence, the maturity of the option held must equal the maturity of the option used for hedging.  

# 19.12  

The fund is worth $\$ 300,000$ times the value of the index. When the value of the portfolio falls by $5 \%$ (to $\$ 342$ million), the value of the index also falls by $5 \%$ to 1140. The fund manager therefore requires European put options on 300,000 times the index with exercise price 1140.  

a) $S _ { 0 } = 1 2 0 0$ , $K = 1 1 4 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 6$ , $\sigma = 0 . 3 0$ , $T = 0 . 5 0$ and $\scriptstyle q = 0 . 0 3$ . Hence,  

$$
d _ { 1 } = \frac { \ln ( 1 2 0 0 / 1 1 4 0 ) + \left( 0 . 0 6 - 0 . 0 3 + 0 . 3 ^ { 2 } / 2 \right) \times 0 . 5 } { 0 . 3 \sqrt { 0 . 5 } } = 0 . 4 1 8 6
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 3 { \sqrt { 0 . 5 } } = 0 . 2 0 6 4
$$  

$$
N ( d _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 6 6 2 2 ; ~ N ( d _ { 2 } ) = 0 . 5 8 1 8
$$  

$$
N ( - d _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 3 3 7 8 ; ~ N ( - d _ { 2 } ) = 0 . 4 1 8 2
$$  

The value of one put option is  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \quad 1 1 4 0 e ^ { - r T } N ( - d _ { 2 } ) - 1 2 0 0 e ^ { - q T } N ( - d _ { 1 } ) } \\ & { = 1 1 4 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 \times 0 . 5 } \times 0 . 4 1 8 2 - 1 2 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 5 } \times 0 . 3 3 7 8 } \\ & { = 6 3 . 4 0 } \end{array}
$$  

The total cost of the insurance is therefore, $3 0 0 , 0 0 0 \times 6 3 . 4 0 = \ S 1 9 , 0 2 0 , 0 0 0$  

b) From put–call parity  

$$
S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } + p = c + K e ^ { - r T }
$$  

or,  

$$
p = c - S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } + K e ^ { - r T }
$$  

This shows that a put option can be created by selling (or shorting) $e ^ { - q T }$ of the index, buying a call option and investing the remainder at the risk-free rate of interest. Applying this to the situation under consideration, the fund manager should:  

1. $\mathrm { S e l l } 3 6 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 5 } = { \& 3 5 4 . 6 4 }$ million of stock. 2. Buy call options on 300,000 times the index with exercise price 1140 and maturity in six months. 3. Invest the remaining cash at the risk-free interest rate of $6 \%$ per annum. This strategy gives the same result as buying put options directly.  

c The delta of one put option is  

$$
e ^ { - q T } [ N ( d _ { 1 } ) - 1 ]
$$  

$$
= e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 5 } ( 0 . 6 6 2 2 - 1 )
$$  

This indicates that $3 3 . 2 7 \%$ of the portfolio (i.e., $\$ 123.77$ million) should be initially sold and invested in risk-free securities.  

d) The delta of a nine-month index futures contract is  

$$
e ^ { ( r - q ) T } = e ^ { 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 7 5 } = 1 . 0 2 3
$$  

The spot short position required is  

$$
\frac { 1 1 9 , 7 7 0 , 0 0 0 } { 1 2 0 0 } = 9 9 , 8 0 8
$$  

times the index. Hence, a short position in  

$$
\frac { 9 9 , 8 0 8 } { 1 . 0 2 3 \times 2 5 0 } = 3 9 0
$$  

futures contracts is required.  

# 19.13  

When the value of the portfolio goes down $5 \%$ in six months, the total return from the portfolio, including dividends, in the six months is  

$$
- 5 + 2 = - 3 \%
$$  

that is, $- 6 \%$ per annum. This is $12 \%$ per annum less than the risk-free interest rate. Since the portfolio has a beta of 1.5, we would expect the market to provide a return of $8 \%$ per annum less than the risk-free interest rate; that is, we would expect the market to provide a return of $- 2 \%$ per annum. Since dividends on the market index are $3 \%$ per annum, we would expect the market index to have dropped at the rate of $5 \%$ per annum or $2 . 5 \%$ per six months; that is, we would expect the market to have dropped to 1170. A total of $4 5 0 , 0 0 0 = ( 1 . 5 { \times } 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 )$ put options on the index with exercise price 1170 and exercise date in six months are therefore required.  

$$
d _ { 1 } = \frac { \ln ( 1 2 0 0 / 1 1 7 0 ) + \left( 0 . 0 6 - 0 . 0 3 + 0 . 0 9 / 2 \right) \times 0 . 5 } { 0 . 3 \sqrt { 0 . 5 } } = 0 . 2 9 6 1
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 3 { \sqrt { 0 . 5 } } = 0 . 0 8 4 0
$$  

$$
N ( d _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 6 1 6 4 ; ~ N ( d _ { 2 } ) = 0 . 5 3 3 5
$$  

$$
N ( - d _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 3 8 3 6 ; ~ N ( - d _ { 2 } ) = 0 . 4 6 6 5
$$  

The value of one put option is  

$$
K e ^ { - r T } N ( - d _ { 2 } ) - S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } N ( - d _ { 1 } )
$$  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { = 1 1 7 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 \times 0 . 5 } \times 0 . 4 6 6 5 - 1 2 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 5 } \times 0 . 3 8 3 6 } \\ { = 7 6 . 2 8 } \end{array}
$$  

The total cost of the insurance is therefore, $4 5 0 , 0 0 0 \times 7 6 . 2 8 = \ S 3 4 , 3 2 6 , 0 0 0$  

Note that this is significantly greater than the cost of the insurance in Problem 19.12.  

b) As in Problem 19.12, the fund manager can 1) sell $\$ 354.64$ million of stock, 2) buy call options on 450,000 times the index with exercise price 1170 and exercise date in six months, and 3) invest the remaining cash at the risk-free interest rate.  

c) The portfolio is $50 \%$ more volatile than the index. When the insurance is considered as an option on the portfolio, the parameters are as follows: $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 3 6 0$ , $K = 3 4 2$ , $r = 0 . 0 6$ , $\sigma = 0 . 4 5$ , $T = 0 . 5$ and $\textstyle q = 0 . 0 4$  

$$
d _ { 1 } = \frac { \ln ( 3 6 0 / 3 4 2 ) + \left( 0 . 0 6 - 0 . 0 4 + 0 . 4 5 ^ { 2 } / 2 \right) \times 0 . 5 } { 0 . 4 5 \sqrt { 0 . 5 } } = 0 . 3 5 1 7
$$  

$$
N ( d _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 6 3 7 4
$$  

The delta of the option is  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \quad e ^ { - q T } [ N ( d _ { 1 } ) - 1 ] } \\ & { = e ^ { - 0 . 0 4 \times 0 . 5 } ( 0 . 6 3 7 4 - 1 ) } \\ & { = - 0 . 3 5 5 } \end{array}
$$  

This indicates that $3 5 . 5 \%$ of the portfolio (i.e., $\$ 127.8$ million) should be sold and invested in riskless securities.  

d) We now return to the situation considered in (a) where put options on the index are required. The delta of each put option is  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \quad { { e } ^ { - q T } } ( N ( d _ { 1 } ) - 1 ) } \\ & { = { { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 5 } } ( 0 . 6 1 6 4 - 1 ) } \\ & { = - 0 . 3 7 7 9 } \end{array}
$$  

The delta of the total position required in put options is $- 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 \times 0 . 3 7 7 9 = - 1 7 0 , 0 0 0$ . The delta of a nine month index futures is (see Problem 19.12) 1.023. Hence, a short position in  

$$
\frac { 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 } { 1 . 0 2 3 \times 2 5 0 } = 6 6 5
$$  

index futures contracts.  

# 19.14  

a) For a call option on a non-dividend-paying stock,  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \Delta = N ( d _ { 1 } ) } \\ & { \Gamma = \cfrac { N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) } { S _ { 0 } \sigma \sqrt { T } } } \\ & { \Theta = - \cfrac { S _ { 0 } N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \sigma } { 2 \sqrt { T } } - r K e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } ) } \end{array}
$$  

Hence, the left-hand side of equation (19.4) is:  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { \displaystyle = - \frac { S _ { 0 } N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \sigma } { 2 \sqrt { T } } - r K e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } ) + r S _ { 0 } N ( d _ { 1 } ) + \frac 1 2 \sigma S _ { 0 } \frac { N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) } { \sqrt { T } } } \\ { \displaystyle = r [ S _ { 0 } N ( d _ { 1 } ) - K e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } ) ] } \\ { \displaystyle = r \Pi } \end{array}
$$  

b) For a put option on a non-dividend-paying stock,  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { \displaystyle \Delta = N ( d _ { 1 } ) - 1 = - N ( - d _ { 1 } ) } \\ { \displaystyle \Gamma = \frac { N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) } { S _ { 0 } \sigma \sqrt { T } } } \\ { \displaystyle \Theta = - \frac { S _ { 0 } N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \sigma } { 2 \sqrt { T } } + r K e ^ { - r T } N ( - d _ { 2 } ) } \end{array}
$$  

Hence, the left-hand side of equation (19.4) is:  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { \displaystyle - \frac { S _ { 0 } N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { \scriptscriptstyle 1 } ) \sigma } { 2 \sqrt { T } } + r K e ^ { - r T } N ( - d _ { \scriptscriptstyle 2 } ) - r S _ { 0 } N ( - d _ { \scriptscriptstyle 1 } ) + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma S _ { 0 } \frac { N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { \scriptscriptstyle 1 } ) } { \sqrt { T } } } \\ { \displaystyle = r [ K e ^ { - r T } N ( - d _ { \scriptscriptstyle 2 } ) - S _ { 0 } N ( - d _ { \scriptscriptstyle 1 } ) ] } \\ { \displaystyle = r \Pi } \end{array}
$$  

c) For a portfolio of options, $\Pi , \Delta , \Theta$ and $\Gamma$ are the sums of their values for the individual options in the portfolio. It follows that equation (19.4) is true for any portfolio of European put and call options.  

# 19.15  

A currency is analogous to a stock paying a continuous dividend yield at rate $r _ { f }$ . The differential equation for a portfolio of derivatives dependent on a currency is (see equation 17.6)  

$$
\frac { \partial \Pi } { \partial t } + ( r - r _ { f } ) S \frac { \partial \Pi } { \partial S } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } S ^ { 2 } \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } \Pi } { \partial S ^ { 2 } } = r \Pi
$$  

Hence,  

$$
\Theta + ( r - r _ { f } ) S \Delta + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } S ^ { 2 } \Gamma = r \Pi
$$  

Similarly, for a portfolio of derivatives dependent on a futures price, $F$ (see equation 18.6)  

$$
\Theta + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } F ^ { 2 } \Gamma = r \Pi
$$  

# 19.16  

We can regard the position of all portfolio insurers taken together as a single put option. The three known parameters of the option, before the $23 \%$ decline, are $S _ { 0 } = 7 0$ , $K = 6 6 . 5$ , $T = 1$ . Other parameters can be estimated as $r = 0 . 0 6$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2 5$ and $\scriptstyle q = 0 . 0 3$ . Then:  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 7 0 / 6 6 . 5 ) + ( 0 . 0 6 - 0 . 0 3 + 0 . 2 5 ^ { 2 } / 2 ) } { 0 . 2 5 } } = 0 . 4 5 0 2
$$  

$$
N ( d _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 6 7 3 7
$$  

The delta of the option is  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { e ^ { - q T } [ N ( d _ { 1 } ) - 1 ] } } \\ { { = e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 } ( 0 . 6 7 3 7 - 1 ) } } \\ { { = - 0 . 3 1 6 7 } } \end{array}
$$  

This shows that $3 1 . 6 7 \%$ or $\$ 22.17$ billion of assets should have been sold before the decline. These numbers can also be produced from DerivaGem by selecting Underlying Type and Index and Option Type as Black–Scholes European.  

After the decline, $S _ { 0 } = 5 3 . 9$ , $K = 6 6 . 5$ , $T = 1$ , $r = 0 . 0 6$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2 5$ and $\scriptstyle q = 0 . 0 3$ .  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 5 3 . 9 / 6 6 . 5 ) + ( 0 . 0 6 - 0 . 0 3 + 0 . 2 5 ^ { 2 } / 2 ) } { 0 . 2 5 } } = - 0 . 5 9 5 3
$$  

$$
N ( d _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 2 7 5 8
$$  

The delta of the option has dropped to  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 5 } ( 0 . 2 7 5 8 - 1 ) } } \\ { { = - 0 . 7 0 2 8 } } \end{array}
$$  

This shows that cumulatively $70 . 2 8 \%$ of the assets originally held should be sold. An additional $3 8 . 6 1 \%$ of the original portfolio should be sold. The sales measured at pre-crash prices are about $\$ 27.0$ billion. At post-crash prices, they are about $\$ 20.8$ billion.  

# 19.17  

With our usual notation, the value of a forward contract on the asset is $S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } - K e ^ { - r T }$ . When there is a small change, $\Delta S$ , in $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } }$ the value of the forward contract changes by $e ^ { - q T } \Delta S$ . The delta of the forward contract is therefore $e ^ { - q T }$ . The futures price is $S _ { 0 } e ^ { ( r - q ) T }$ . When there is a small change, $\Delta S$ , in $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } }$ the futures price changes by $\Delta S e ^ { ( r - q ) T }$ . Given the daily settlement procedures in futures contracts, this is also the immediate change in the wealth of the holder of the futures contract. The delta of the futures contract is therefore $e ^ { ( r - q ) T }$ . We conclude that the deltas of a futures and forward contract are not the same. The delta of the futures is greater than the delta of the corresponding forward by a factor of $e ^ { r T }$ . (Business Snapshot 5.2 is related to this question.)  

# 19.18  

The delta indicates that when the value of the exchange rate increases by $\$ 01$ , the value of the bank’s position increases by $0 . 0 1 \times 3 0 , 0 0 0 = \mathbb { S } 3 0 0$ . The gamma indicates that when the exchange rate increases by $\$ 01$ , the delta of the portfolio decreases by $0 . 0 1 \times 8 0 , 0 0 0 = 8 0 0$ . For delta neutrality, $3 0 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { C A D }$ should be shorted. When the exchange rate moves up to 0.93, we expect the delta of the portfolio to decrease by $( 0 . 9 3 - 0 . 9 0 ) \times 8 0 , 0 0 0 = 2 , 4 0 0$ so that it becomes 27,600. To maintain delta neutrality, it is therefore necessary for the bank to unwind its short position 2,400 CAD so that a net 27,600 have been shorted. As shown in the text (see Figure 19.8), when a portfolio is delta neutral and has a negative gamma, a loss is experienced when there is a large movement in the underlying asset price. We can conclude that the bank is likely to have lost money.  

# 19.19  

(a) For a non-dividend paying stock, put–call parity gives at a general time t :  

$$
p + S = c + K e ^ { - r ( T - t ) }
$$  

Differentiating with respect to $S$ :  

$$
\frac { \hat { o } p } { \hat { o } S } + 1 = \frac { \hat { o } c } { \hat { o } S }
$$  

or  

$$
\frac { \partial p } { \partial S } = \frac { \partial c } { \partial S } - 1
$$  

This shows that the delta of a European put equals the delta of the corresponding European call less 1.0.  

(b) Differentiating with respect to $S$ again  

$$
\frac { \hat { \sigma } ^ { 2 } p } { \hat { \sigma } ^ { 2 } } = \frac { \hat { \sigma } ^ { 2 } c } { \hat { \sigma } ^ { 2 } }
$$  

Hence, the gamma of a European put equals the gamma of a European call.  

(c) Differentiating the put–call parity relationship with respect to $\sigma$  

$$
\frac { \hat { c } p } { \hat { \sigma } \sigma } = \frac { \hat { \sigma } c } { \hat { \sigma } \sigma }
$$  

showing that the vega of a European put equals the vega of a European call.  

(d) Differentiating the put–call parity relationship with respect to $t$  

$$
\frac { \hat { O } p } { \hat { O } t } = r K e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } + \frac { \hat { O } c } { \hat { O } t }
$$  

This is in agreement with the thetas of European calls and puts given in Section 19.5 since $N ( d _ { 2 } ) = 1 - N ( - d _ { 2 } )$ .  

# 19.20  

The delta of the portfolio is $- 1 , 0 0 0 \times 0 . 5 0 - 5 0 0 \times 0 . 8 0 - 2 , 0 0 0 \times ( - 0 . 4 0 ) - 5 0 0 \times 0 . 7 0 = - 4 5 0$  

The gamma of the portfolio is $- 1 , 0 0 0 \times 2 . 2 - 5 0 0 \times 0 . 6 - 2 , 0 0 0 \times 1 . 3 - 5 0 0 \times 1 . 8 = - 6 , 0 0 0$  

The vega of the portfolio is  

$$
- 1 , 0 0 0 \times 1 . 8 - 5 0 0 \times 0 . 2 - 2 , 0 0 0 \times 0 . 7 - 5 0 0 \times 1 . 4 = - 4 , 0 0 0
$$  

(a) A long position in 4,000 traded options will give a gamma-neutral portfolio since the long position has a gamma of $4 , 0 0 0 \times 1 . 5 = + 6 , 0 0 0$ . The delta of the whole portfolio (including traded options) is then: $4 , 0 0 0 \times 0 . 6 - 4 5 0 = 1 , 9 5 0$ Hence, in addition to the 4,000 traded options, a short position of 1,950 in sterling is necessary so that the portfolio is both gamma and delta neutral.   
(b) A long position in 5,000 traded options will give a vega-neutral portfolio since the long position has a vega of $5 , 0 0 0 \times 0 . 8 = + 4 , 0 0 0$ . The delta of the whole portfolio (including traded options) is then $5 , 0 0 0 \times 0 . 6 - 4 5 0 = 2 , 5 5 0$ Hence, in addition to the 5,000 traded options, a short position of 2,550 in sterling is necessary so that the portfolio is both vega and delta neutral.  

# 19.21  

Let $w _ { 1 }$ be the position in the first traded option and $w _ { 2 }$ be the position in the second traded  

option. We require:  

$$
6 , 0 0 0 = 1 . 5 w _ { 1 } + 0 . 5 w _ { 2 }
$$  

$$
4 , 0 0 0 = 0 . 8 w _ { 1 } + 0 . 6 w _ { 2 }
$$  

The solution to these equations can easily be seen to be $w _ { 1 } = 3 , 2 0 0$ , $w _ { 2 } = 2 , 4 0 0$ . The whole portfolio then has a delta of  

$$
- 4 5 0 + 3 , 2 0 0 \times 0 . 6 + 2 , 4 0 0 \times 0 . 1 = 1 , 7 1 0
$$  

Therefore, the portfolio can be made delta, gamma and vega neutral by taking a long position in 3,200 of the first traded option, a long position in 2,400 of the second traded option, and a short position of 1,710 in sterling.  

# 19.22  

The product provides a six-month return equal to max $( 0 , 0 . 4 R )$  

where $R$ is the return on the index. Suppose that $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } }$ is the current value of the index and $S _ { T }$ is the value in six months.  

When an amount $A$ is invested, the return received at the end of six months is:  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { \displaystyle { \mathcal { A } \operatorname* { m a x } \left( 0 , 0 . 4 \frac { S _ { T } - S _ { 0 } } { S _ { 0 } } \right) } } \\ { \displaystyle { = \frac { 0 . 4 \mathcal { A } } { S _ { 0 } } \operatorname* { m a x } \left( 0 , S _ { T } - S _ { 0 } \right) } } \end{array}
$$  

This is $0 . 4 A / S _ { 0 }$ of at-the-money European call options on the index. With the usual notation, they have value:  

$$
\frac { 0 . 4 A } { S _ { 0 } } [ S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } N ( d _ { 1 } ) - S _ { 0 } e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } ) ]
$$  

$$
= 0 . 4 A [ e ^ { - q T } N ( d _ { 1 } ) - e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } ) ]
$$  

In this case, $r = 0 . 0 8$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2 5$ , $T = 0 . 5 0$ and $\scriptstyle q = 0 . 0 3$  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \left( 0 . 0 8 - 0 . 0 3 + 0 . 2 5 ^ { 2 } / 2 \right) 0 . 5 0 } { 0 . 2 5 { \sqrt { 0 . 5 0 } } } } = 0 . 2 2 9 8
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 2 5 { \sqrt { 0 . 5 0 } } = 0 . 0 5 3 0
$$  

$$
N ( d _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 5 9 0 9 ; ~ N ( d _ { 2 } ) = 0 . 5 2 1 2
$$  

The value of the European call options being offered is  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { 0 . 4 \overset { \cdot } { A } ( e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 5 } \times \overset { \cdot } { 0 } . 5 9 0 9 - e ^ { - 0 . 0 8 \times 0 . 5 } \times 0 . 5 2 1 2 ) } \\ & { = 0 . 0 3 2 5 A } \end{array}
$$  

This is the present value of the payoff from the product. If an investor buys the product, the investor avoids having to pay $0 . 0 3 2 5 A$ at time zero for the underlying option. The cash flows to the investor are therefore,   
Time $0 { : - A + 0 . 0 3 2 5 A { = - 0 . 9 6 7 5 A } }$   
After six months: $+ A$   
The return with continuous compounding is $2 \ln ( 1 / 0 . 9 6 7 5 ) = 0 . 0 6 6$ or $6 . 6 \%$ per annum. The product is therefore slightly less attractive than a risk-free investment.  

(a)  

$$
F N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) = \frac { F } { \sqrt { 2 \pi } } e ^ { - d _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } / 2 }
$$  

$$
K N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 2 } ) = K N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } - \sigma \sqrt { T } ) = \frac { K } { \sqrt { 2 \pi } } e ^ { - ( d _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } / 2 ) + d _ { 1 } \sigma \sqrt { T } - \sigma ^ { 2 } T / 2 }
$$  

Because $d _ { 1 } \sigma \sqrt { T } = \ln ( F / K ) + \sigma ^ { 2 } T / 2$ ,  the second equation reduces to  

$$
K N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 2 } ) = \frac { K } { \sqrt { 2 \pi } } e ^ { - ( d _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } / 2 ) + l n ( F / K ) } = \frac { F } { \sqrt { 2 \pi } } e ^ { - d _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } / 2 }
$$  

The result follows.  

$$
\frac { \hat { \mathcal { O } } c } { \hat { \mathcal { O } } F } = e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 1 } ) + e ^ { - r T } F N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \frac { \hat { \mathcal { O } } d _ { 1 } } { \hat { \mathcal { O } } F } - e ^ { - r T } K N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 2 } ) \frac { \hat { \mathcal { O } } d _ { 2 } } { \hat { \mathcal { O } } F }
$$  

Because  

$$
\frac { \partial d _ { 1 } } { \partial F } = \frac { \partial d _ { 2 } } { \partial F }
$$  

it follows from the result in (a) that  

$$
\frac { \partial c } { \partial F } = e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 1 } )
$$  

(c)  

$$
\frac { \partial c } { \partial \sigma } = e ^ { - r T } F N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \frac { \partial d _ { 1 } } { \partial \sigma } - e ^ { - r T } K N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 2 } ) \frac { \partial d _ { 2 } } { \partial \sigma }
$$  

Because d1  d2  T  

$$
\frac { \partial d _ { 1 } } { \partial \sigma } = \frac { \partial d _ { 2 } } { \partial \sigma } + \sqrt { T }
$$  

From the result in (a), it follows that  

$$
\frac { \partial c } { \partial \sigma } = e ^ { - r T } F N ^ { \prime } ( d _ { 1 } ) \sqrt { T }
$$  

(d) Rho is given by  

$$
\frac { \partial c } { \partial r } = - T e ^ { - r T } [ F N ( d _ { 1 } ) - K N ( d _ { 2 } ) ] ]
$$  

or $- c T$ .  

Because $q = r$ in the case of a futures option there are two components to rho. One arises from differentiation with respect to $r$ , the other from differentiation with respect to $q$ .  

# 19.24  

For the option considered in Section 19.1, $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 4 9$ , $K = 5 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 5$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2 0$ , and $T = 2 0 / 5 2$ . DerivaGem shows that $\Theta = - 0 . 0 1 1 7 9 5 \times 3 6 5 = - 4 . 3 0 5$ , $\Delta = 0 . 5 2 1 6$ , $\Gamma = 0 . 0 6 5 5 4 4$ , $\Pi = 2 . 4 0 0 5$ . The left hand side of equation (19.4)  

$$
- 4 . 3 0 5 + 0 . 0 5 \times 4 9 \times 0 . 5 2 1 6 + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \times 0 . 2 ^ { 2 } \times 4 9 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 0 6 5 5 4 4 = 0 . 1 2 0
$$  

The right hand side is $0 . 0 5 \times 2 . 4 0 0 5 = 0 . 1 2 0$ This shows that the result in equation (19.4) is satisfied.  

# CHAPTER 20 Volatility Smiles and Volatility Surfaces  

# Practice Questions  

20.1 (a) A smile similar to that in Figure 20.7 is observed. (b) An upward sloping volatility smile is observed.  

# 20.2  

Jumps tend to make both tails of the stock price distribution heavier than those of the lognormal distribution. This creates a volatility smile similar to that in Figure 20.1. The volatility smile is likely to be more pronounced for the three-month option.  

# 20.3  

The put has a price that is too low relative to the call's price. The correct trading strategy is to buy the put, buy the stock, and sell the call.  

# 20.4  

The heavier left tail should lead to high prices, and therefore high implied volatilities, for outof-the-money (low-strike-price) puts. Similarly, the less heavy right tail should lead to low prices, and therefore low volatilities for out-of-the-money (high-strike-price) calls. A volatility smile where volatility is a decreasing function of strike price results.  

# 20.5  

With the notation in the text  

$$
c _ { \mathrm { b s } } + K e ^ { - r T } = p _ { \mathrm { b s } } + S e ^ { - q T }
$$  

$$
c _ { \mathrm { m k t } } + K e ^ { - r T } = p _ { \mathrm { m k t } } + S e ^ { - q T }
$$  

It follows that  

$$
c _ { \mathrm { b s } } - c _ { \mathrm { m k t } } = p _ { \mathrm { b s } } - p _ { \mathrm { m k t } }
$$  

In this case, $c _ { \mathrm { m k t } } = 3 . 0 0$ ; $c _ { \mathrm { b s } } ^ { \phantom { + } } = 3 . 5 0$ ; and $p _ { \mathrm { { b s } } } = 1 . 0 0$ . It follows that $p _ { \mathrm { m k t } }$ should be 0.50.  

# 20.6  

The crashophobia argument is an attempt to explain the pronounced volatility skew in equity markets since 1987. (This was the year equity markets shocked everyone by crashing more than $20 \%$ in one day). The argument is that traders are concerned about another crash and as a result increase the price of out-of-the-money puts. This creates the volatility skew.  

# 20.7  

The probability distribution of the stock price in one month is not lognormal. Possibly, it consists of two lognormal distributions superimposed upon each other and is bimodal. Black– Scholes is clearly inappropriate, because it assumes that the stock price at any future time is lognormal.  

# 20.8  

When the asset price is positively correlated with volatility, the volatility tends to increase as  

the asset price increases, producing less heavy left tails and heavier right tails. Implied volatility then increases with the strike price.  

# 20.9  

There are a number of problems in testing an option pricing model empirically. These include the problem of obtaining synchronous data on stock prices and option prices, the problem of estimating the dividends that will be paid on the stock during the option's life, the problem of distinguishing between situations where the market is inefficient and situations where the option pricing model is incorrect, and the problems of estimating stock price volatility.  

# 20.10  

In this case, the probability distribution of the exchange rate has a thin left tail and a thin right tail relative to the lognormal distribution. We are in the opposite situation to that described for foreign currencies in Section 20.2. Both out-of-the-money and in-the-money calls and puts can be expected to have lower implied volatilities than at-the-money calls and puts. The pattern of implied volatilities is likely to be similar to Figure 20.7.  

# 20.11  

A deep-out-of-the-money option has a low value. Decreases in its volatility reduce its value. However, this reduction is small because the value can never go below zero. Increases in its volatility, on the other hand, can lead to significant percentage increases in the value of the option. The option does, therefore, have some of the same attributes as an option on volatility.  

# 20.12  

Put–call parity implies that European put and call options have the same implied volatility. If a call option has an implied volatility of $30 \%$ and a put option has an implied volatility of $3 3 \%$ , the call is priced too low relative to the put. The correct trading strategy is to buy the call, sell the put and short the stock. This does not depend on the lognormal assumption underlying Black–Scholes–Merton. Put–call parity is true for any set of assumptions.  

# 20.13  

Suppose that $p$ is the probability of a favorable ruling. The expected price of the company's stock tomorrow is  

$$
7 5 p + 5 0 ( 1 - p ) = 5 0 + 2 5 p
$$  

This must be the price of the stock today. (We ignore the expected return to an investor over one day.) Hence,  

$$
5 0 + 2 5 p = 6 0
$$  

or $p = 0 . 4$ .  

If the ruling is favorable, the volatility, $\sigma$ , will be $2 5 \%$ . Other option parameters are $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 7 5$ , $r = 0 . 0 6$ , and $T = 0 . 5$ . For a value of $K$ equal to 50, DerivaGem gives the value of a European call option price as 26.502.  

If the ruling is unfavorable, the volatility, $\sigma$ will be $40 \%$ Other option parameters are $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 5 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 6$ , and $T = 0 . 5$ . For a value of $K$ equal to 50, DerivaGem gives the value of a European call option price as 6.310.  

The value today of a European call option with a strike price today is the weighted average of 26.502 and 6.310 or,  

$$
0 . 4 \times 2 6 . 5 0 2 + 0 . 6 \times 6 . 3 1 0 = 1 4 . 3 8 7
$$  

DerivaGem can be used to calculate the implied volatility when the option has this price. The parameter values are $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 6 0$ , $K = 5 0$ , $T = 0 . 5$ , $r = 0 . 0 6$ and $c = 1 4 . 3 8 7$ . The implied volatility is $4 7 . 7 6 \%$ .  

These calculations can be repeated for other strike prices. The results are shown in the table below. The pattern of implied volatilities is shown in Figure S20.1.

# 20.14  

As pointed out in Chapters 5 and 17, an exchange rate behaves like a stock that provides a dividend yield equal to the foreign risk-free rate. Whereas the growth rate in a non-dividendpaying stock in a risk-neutral world is $r$ , the growth rate in the exchange rate in a risk-neutral world is $r - r _ { f }$ . Exchange rates have low systematic risks and so we can reasonably assume that this is also the growth rate in the real world. In this case, the foreign risk-free rate equals the domestic risk-free rate ${ \bf \nabla } \cdot { \bf r } = r _ { f }$ ). The expected growth rate in the exchange rate is therefore zero. If $S _ { T }$ is the exchange rate at time $T .$ , its probability distribution is given by equation (14.3) with $\mu = 0$ :  

$$
\ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } \sim \varphi \big ( \ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle 0 } - \sigma ^ { 2 } T / 2 , \sigma ^ { 2 } T \big )
$$  

where $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } }$ is the exchange rate at time zero and $\sigma$ is the volatility of the exchange rate. In this case, $S _ { \scriptscriptstyle 0 } = 0 . 8 0 0 0$ and $\sigma = 0 . 1 2$ , and $T = 0 . 2 5$ so that  

$$
\ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } \sim \varphi \big ( \ln 0 . 8 - 0 . 1 2 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 2 5 / 2 , 0 . 1 2 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 2 5 \big )
$$  

$$
\ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } \sim \varphi \big ( - 0 . 2 2 4 9 , 0 . 0 6 ^ { 2 } \big )
$$  

a) l $\mathrm { ~ n ~ } 0 . 7 0 = - 0 . 3 5 6 7$ . The probability that $S _ { r } < 0 . 7 0$ is the same as the probability that $\ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } < - 0 . 3 5 6 7$ . It is  

$$
N { \left( \frac { - 0 . 3 5 6 7 + 0 . 2 2 4 9 } { 0 . 0 6 } \right) } = N ( - 2 . 1 9 5 5 )
$$  

This is $1 . 4 1 \%$ .  

b) $\ln 0 . 7 5 = - 0 . 2 8 7 7 .$ . The probability that $S _ { T } < 0 . 7 5$ is the same as the probability that $\ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } < - 0 . 2 8 7 7$ . It is  

$$
N { \left( \frac { - 0 . 2 8 7 7 + 0 . 2 2 4 9 } { 0 . 0 6 } \right) } = N ( - 1 . 0 4 5 6 )
$$  

This is $14 . 7 9 \%$ . The probability that the exchange rate is between 0.70 and 0.75 is therefore $1 4 . 7 9 - 1 . 4 1 = 1 3 . 3 8 \%$ .  

c) $\ln { 0 . 8 0 } = - 0 . 2 2 3 1$ . The probability that $S _ { T } < 0 . 8 0$ is the same as the probability that $\ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } < - 0 . 2 2 3 1$ . It is  

$$
N { \left( \frac { - 0 . 2 2 3 1 + 0 . 2 2 4 9 } { 0 . 0 6 } \right) } { = } N ( 0 . 0 3 0 0 )
$$  

This is $5 1 . 2 0 \%$ . The probability that the exchange rate is between 0.75 and 0.80 is therefore $5 1 . 2 0 - 1 4 . 7 9 = 3 6 . 4 1 \%$ .  

d) $\ln 0 . 8 5 = - 0 . 1 6 2 5 .$ . The probability that $S _ { T } < 0 . 8 5$ is the same as the probability that $\ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } < - 0 . 1 6 2 5$ . It is  

$$
N { \left( \frac { - 0 . 1 6 2 5 + 0 . 2 2 4 9 } { 0 . 0 6 } \right) } = N ( 1 . 0 4 0 4 )
$$  

This is $8 5 . 0 9 \%$ . The probability that the exchange rate is between 0.80 and 0.85 is therefore $8 5 . 0 9 - 5 1 . 2 0 = 3 3 . 8 9 \%$  

e) $\ln 0 . 9 0 = - 0 . 1 0 5 4 .$ . The probability that $S _ { T } < 0 . 9 0$ is the same as the probability that $\ln S _ { _ T } < - 0 . 1 0 5 4$ . It is  

$$
N { \left( \frac { - 0 . 1 0 5 4 + 0 . 2 2 4 9 } { 0 . 0 6 } \right) } { = } N ( 1 . 9 9 3 1 )
$$  

This is $9 7 . 6 9 \%$ . The probability that the exchange rate is between 0.85 and 0.90 is therefore $9 7 . 6 9 - 8 5 . 0 9 = 1 2 . 6 0 \%$ .  

f) The probability that the exchange rate is greater than 0.90 is $1 0 0 - 9 7 . 6 9 = 2 . 3 1 \%$ .  

The volatility smile encountered for foreign exchange options is shown in Figure 20.1 of the text and implies the probability distribution in Figure 20.2. Figure 20.2 suggests that we would expect the probabilities in (a), (c), (d), and (f) to be too low and the probabilities in (b) and (e) to be too high.  

# 20.15  

The difference between the two implied volatilities is consistent with Figure 20.3 in the text. For equities, the volatility smile is downward sloping. A high strike price option has a lower implied volatility than a low strike price option. The reason is that traders consider the  

probability of a large downward movement in the stock price is higher than that predicted by the lognormal probability distribution. The implied distribution assumed by traders is shown in Figure 20.4.  

To use DerivaGem to calculate the price of the first option, proceed as follows. Select Equity as the Underlying Type in the first worksheet. Select Black–Scholes European as the Option Type. Input the stock price as 40, volatility as $3 5 \%$ , risk-free rate as $5 \%$ , time to exercise as 0.5 year, and exercise price as 30. Leave the dividend table blank because we are assuming no dividends. Select the button corresponding to call. Do not select the implied volatility button. Hit the Enter key and click on calculate. DerivaGem will show the price of the option as 11.155. Change the volatility to $2 8 \%$ and the strike price to 50. Hit the Enter key and click on calculate. DerivaGem will show the price of the option as 0.725.   
Put–call parity is  

$$
c + K e ^ { - r T } = p + S _ { 0 }
$$  

so that  

$$
p = c + K e ^ { - r T } - S _ { 0 }
$$  

For the first option, $c = 1 1 . 1 5 5$ , $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 4 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 5 4$ , $K = 3 0$ , and $T = 0 . 5$ so that  

$$
p = 1 1 . 1 5 5 + 3 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } - 4 0 = 0 . 4 1 4
$$  

For the second option, $c = 0 . 7 2 5$ , $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 4 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 6$ , $K = 5 0$ , and $T = 0 . 5$ so that  

$$
p = 0 . 7 2 5 + 5 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } - 4 0 = 9 . 4 9 0
$$  

To use DerivaGem to calculate the implied volatility of the first put option, input the stock price as 40, the risk-free rate as $5 \%$ , time to exercise as 0.5 year, and the exercise price as 30. Input the price as 0.414 in the second half of the Option Data table. Select the buttons for a put option and implied volatility. Hit the Enter key and click on calculate. DerivaGem will show the implied volatility as $34 . 9 9 \%$ .  

Similarly, to use DerivaGem to calculate the implied volatility of the first put option, input the stock price as 40, the risk-free rate as $5 \%$ , time to exercise as 0.5 year, and the exercise price as 50. Input the price as 9.490 in the second half of the Option Data table. Select the buttons for a put option and implied volatility. Hit the Enter key and click on calculate. DerivaGem will show the implied volatility as $2 7 . 9 9 \%$ .  

These results are what we would expect. DerivaGem gives the implied volatility of a put with strike price 30 to be almost exactly the same as the implied volatility of a call with a strike price of 30. Similarly, it gives the implied volatility of a put with strike price 50 to be almost exactly the same as the implied volatility of a call with a strike price of 50.  

# 20.16  

When plain vanilla call and put options are being priced, traders do use the Black–Scholes– Merton model as an interpolation tool. They calculate implied volatilities for the options whose prices they can observe in the market. By interpolating between strike prices and between times to maturity, they estimate implied volatilities for other options. These implied volatilities are then substituted into Black–Scholes–Merton to calculate prices for these options. In practice, much of the work in producing a table such as Table 20.2 in the over-thecounter market is done by interdealer brokers. These brokers often act as intermediaries between participants in the over-the-counter market and usually have more information on the trades taking place than any individual financial institution. The brokers provide a table such as Table 20.2 to their clients as a service.  

# 20.17  

The implied volatility is $1 3 . 4 5 \%$ . We get the same answer by (a) interpolating between strike prices of 1.00 and 1.05 and then between maturities six months and one year, and (b) interpolating between maturities of six months and one year and then between strike prices of 1.00 and 1.05.  

# 20.18  

In liquidation, the company's stock price must be at least $3 0 0 , 0 0 0 / 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 = \ S 3$ . The company's stock price should therefore always be at least $\$ 3$ . This means that the stock price distribution that has a thinner left tail and fatter right tail than the lognormal distribution. An upward sloping volatility smile can be expected.  

# 20.19 (Excel file)  

The following table shows the percentage of daily returns greater than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 standard deviations for each currency. The pattern is similar to that in Table 20.1.  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>>1sd</td><td>>2sd</td><td>>3sd</td><td>>4sd</td><td>>5sd</td><td>>6sd</td></tr><tr><td>EUR</td><td>22.62</td><td>5.21</td><td>1.70</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.20</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>CAD</td><td>23.12</td><td>5.01</td><td>1.60</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.20</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>GBP</td><td>22.62</td><td>4.70</td><td>1.30</td><td>0.80</td><td>0.50</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>JPY</td><td>25.23</td><td>4.80</td><td>1.50</td><td>0.40</td><td>0.30</td><td>0.10</td></tr><tr><td>Normal</td><td>31.73</td><td>4.55</td><td>0.27</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.00</td><td>0.00</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# 20.20 (Excel file)  

The percentage of times up and down movements happen are shown in the table below.  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>>3sd down</td><td>>3sd up</td></tr><tr><td>S&P500</td><td>1.10</td><td>0.90</td></tr><tr><td>NASDAQ</td><td>0.80</td><td>0.90</td></tr><tr><td>FTSE</td><td>1.30</td><td>0.90</td></tr><tr><td>Nikkei</td><td>1.00</td><td>0.60</td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>1.05</td><td>0.83</td></tr></table></body></html>  

As might be expected from the shape of the volatility smile, large down movements occur more often than large up movements. However, the results are not significant at the $9 5 \%$ level. (The standard error of the Average ${ > } 3 \mathrm { s d }$ down percentage is $0 . 1 8 5 \%$ and the standard error of the Average ${ > } 3 \mathrm { s d }$ up percentage is $0 . 1 6 1 \%$ . The standard deviation of the difference between the two is $0 . 2 4 5 \%$ ).  

# 20.21  

Define $c _ { 1 }$ and $p _ { 1 }$ as the values of the call and the put when the volatility is $\sigma _ { 1 }$ . Define $c _ { 2 }$ and ${ { p } _ { 2 } }$ as the values of the call and the put when the volatility is $\sigma _ { 2 }$ . From put–call parity  

$$
p _ { 1 } + S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } = c _ { 1 } + K e ^ { - r T }
$$  

$$
p _ { 2 } + S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } = c _ { 2 } + K e ^ { - r T }
$$  

If follows that  

$$
p _ { 1 } - p _ { 2 } = c _ { 1 } - c _ { 2 }
$$

The value of $g _ { 1 }$ can be calculated by interpolating to get the implied volatility for a sixmonth option with a strike price of 0.75 as $12 . 5 \%$ . This means that options with strike prices of 0.7, 0.75, and 0.8 have implied volatilities of $13 \%$ , $12 . 5 \%$ and $12 \%$ , respectively. From DerivaGem, their prices are $\$ 0.2963$ , $\$ 0.2469$ , and $\$ 0.1976$ , respectively. Using equation (20A.1) with $K = 0 . 7 5$ and $\delta = 0 . 0 5$ , we get  

$$
g _ { 1 } = { \frac { e ^ { 0 . 0 2 5 \times 0 . 5 } ( 0 . 2 9 6 3 + 0 . 1 9 7 6 - 2 \times 0 . 2 4 6 9 ) } { 0 . 0 5 ^ { 2 } } } = 0 . 0 3 1 5
$$  

Similar calculations show that $g _ { \scriptscriptstyle 2 } = 0 . 7 2 4 1$ , $g _ { 3 } = 4 . 0 7 8 8$ , $g _ { 4 } = 3 . 6 7 6 6$ , $g _ { 5 } = 0 . 7 2 8 5$ , and $g _ { 6 } = 0 . 0 8 9 8$ . The total probability between 0.7 and 1.3 is the sum of these numbers multiplied by 0.1 or 0.9329. If the volatility had been flat at $1 1 . 5 \%$ , the values of $g _ { 1 } , g _ { 2 } , g _ { 3 }$ , $g _ { 4 } , g _ { 5 }$ , and $g _ { 6 }$ would have been 0.0239, 0.9328, 4.2248, 3.7590, 0.9613, and 0.0938. The total probability between 0.7 and 1.3 is in this case 0.9996. This shows that the volatility smile gives rise to heavy tails for the distribution.  

# 20.23  

Interpolation gives the volatility for a six-month option with a strike price of 98 as $12 . 8 2 \%$ . Interpolation also gives the volatility for a 12-month option with a strike price of 98 as $1 3 . 7 \%$ . A final interpolation gives the volatility of an 11-month option with a strike price of 98 as $1 3 . 5 5 \%$ . The same answer is obtained if the sequence in which the interpolations are done is reversed.

# Practice Questions  

# 21.1  

Delta, gamma, and theta can be determined from a single binomial tree. Vega is determined by making a small change to the volatility and recomputing the option price using a new tree. Rho is calculated by making a small change to the interest rate and recomputing the option price using a new tree.  

# 21.2  

In this case, $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 6 0$ , $K = 6 0$ , $r = 0 . 1$ , $\sigma = 0 . 4 5$ , $T = 0 . 2 5$ , and $\Delta t = 0 . 0 8 3 3$ . Also  

$$
u = e ^ { \sigma { \sqrt { \Delta t } } } = e ^ { 0 . 4 5 { \sqrt { 0 . 0 8 3 3 } } } = 1 . 1 3 8 7
$$  

$$
d = \frac { 1 } { u } = 0 . 8 7 8 2
$$  

$$
a = e ^ { r \Delta t } = e ^ { 0 . 1 \times 0 . 0 8 3 3 } = 1 . 0 0 8 4
$$  

$$
p = { \frac { a - d } { u - d } } = 0 . 4 9 9 8

$$
1 - p = 0 . 5 0 0 2

The output from DerivaGem for this example is shown in Figure S21.1. The calculated price of the option is $\$ 5.16$ .

21.3 The control variate technique is implemented by:  

1. Valuing an American option using a binomial tree in the usual way $( = f _ { A } )$ .   
2. Valuing the European option with the same parameters as the American option using the same tree $( = f _ { E } )$ .   
3. Valuing the European option using Black–Scholes–Merton $\left( = { f _ { B S M } } \right)$ ). The price of the American option is estimated as $f _ { A } + f _ { B S M } - f _ { E }$ .  

# 21.4  

In this case, $F _ { 0 } = 1 9 8$ , $K = 2 0 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 8$ , $\sigma = 0 . 3$ , $T = 0 . 7 5$ , and $\Delta t = 0 . 2 5$ . Also,  

$$

$$  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { d = \displaystyle \frac { 1 } { u } = 0 . 8 6 0 7 } \\ { a = 1 } \end{array}
$$  

$$

$$

The output from DerivaGem for this example is shown in Figure S21.2. The calculated price of the option is 20.34 cents.

# 21.5  

A binomial tree cannot be used in the way described in this chapter. This is an example of what is known as a history-dependent option. The payoff depends on the path followed by the stock price as well as its final value. The option cannot be valued by starting at the end of the tree and working backward since the payoff at the final branches is not known unambiguously. Chapter 27 describes an extension of the binomial tree approach that can be used to handle options where the payoff depends on the average value of the stock price.  

# 21.6  

Suppose a dividend equal to $D$ is paid during a certain time interval. If $S$ is the stock price at the beginning of the time interval, it will be either $S u - D$ or $S d - D$ at the end of the time interval. At the end of the next time interval, it will be one of $( S u - D ) u$ , $( S u - D ) d$ , $( S d - D ) u$ and $( S d - D ) d$ . Since $( S u - D ) d$ does not equal $( S d \ – D ) u$ , the tree does not recombine. If $S$ is equal to the stock price less the present value of future dividends, this problem is avoided.  

21.7 With the usual notation,  

$$
\begin{array} { r } { p = \frac { a - d } { u - d } } \\ { 1 - p = \frac { u - a } { u - d } } \end{array}
$$  

If $a < d$ or $a > u$ , one of the two probabilities is negative. This happens when  

$$
e ^ { ( r - q ) \Delta t } < e ^ { - \sigma { \sqrt { \Delta t } } }
$$  

or  

$$
e ^ { ( r - q ) \Delta t } > e ^ { \sigma { \sqrt { \Delta t } } }
$$  

This in turn happens when $( q - r ) \sqrt { \Delta t } > \sigma$ or $( r - q ) \sqrt { \Delta t } > \sigma$ . Hence, negative probabilities occur when  

$$
\sigma < | ( r - q ) \sqrt { \Delta t } |
$$  

This is the condition in footnote 8.  

# 21.8  

In Table 21.1, cells A1, A2, A3,…, A100 are random numbers between 0 and 1 defining how far to the right in the square the dart lands. Cells B1, B2, B3,…,B100 are random numbers between 0 and 1 defining how high up in the square the dart lands. For stratified sampling, we could choose equally spaced values for the A's and the B's and consider every possible combination. To generate 100 samples, we need ten equally spaced values for the A's and the B's so that there are $1 0 \times 1 0 = 1 0 0$ combinations. The equally spaced values should be 0.05, 0.15, 0.25,…, 0.95. We could therefore set the A's and B's as follows:  

$$
\mathrm { A l } = \mathrm { A } 2 = \mathrm { A } 3 = . . . = \mathrm { A } 1 0 = 0 . 0 5
$$  

$$
\mathrm { A l } 1 = \mathrm { A l } 2 = \mathrm { A l } 3 = . . . = \mathrm { A } 2 0 = 0 . 1 5
$$  

$$
\mathrm { A } 9 1 = \mathrm { A } 9 2 = \mathrm { A } 9 3 = . . . = \mathrm { A } 1 0 0 = 0 . 9 5
$$  

and  

$$
\mathrm { B l } = \mathrm { B l } 1 = \mathrm { B } 2 1 = . . . . = \mathrm { B } 9 1 = 0 . 0 5
$$  

$$
\mathrm { B } 1 0 = \mathrm { B } 2 0 = \mathrm { B } 3 0 = \ldots = \mathrm { B } 1 0 0 = 0 . 9 5
$$  

We get a value for $\pi$ equal to 3.2, which is closer to the true value than the value of 3.04 obtained with random sampling in Table 21.1. Because samples are not random, we cannot easily calculate a standard error of the estimate.  

# 21.9  

In Monte Carlo simulation, sample values for the derivative security in a risk-neutral world are obtained by simulating paths for the underlying variables. On each simulation run, values for the underlying variables are first determined at time $\Delta t$ , then at time $2 \Delta t$ , then at time $3 \Delta t$ , etc. At time $i \Delta t ( i = 0 , 1 , 2 … )$ , it is not possible to determine whether early exercise is optimal since the range of paths which might occur after time $i \Delta t$ have not been investigated. In short, Monte Carlo simulation works by moving forward from time $t$ to time $T$ . Other numerical procedures which accommodate early exercise work by moving backwards from time $T$ to time $t$ .  

# 21.10  

In this case, $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 5 0$ , $K = 4 9$ , $r = 0 . 0 5$ , $\sigma = 0 . 3 0$ , $T = 0 . 7 5$ , and $\Delta t = 0 . 2 5$ . Also,  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { u = e ^ { \sigma \sqrt { \Delta t } } = e ^ { 0 . 3 0 \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } } = 1 . 1 6 1 \mathrm { ! } } } \\ { { \ } } \\ { { d = \displaystyle \frac { 1 } { u } = 0 . 8 6 0 7 } } \\ { { \ } } \\ { { a = e ^ { r \Delta t } = e ^ { 0 . 0 9 \times 0 . 2 5 } = 1 . 0 1 2 6 } } \\ { { \ } } \\ { { p = \displaystyle \frac { a - d } { u - d } = 0 . 5 0 4 3 } } \\ { { \ } } \\ { { { \displaystyle - p = 0 . 4 9 5 7 } } } \end{array}
$$  

The output from DerivaGem for this example is shown in Figure S21.3. The calculated price of the option is $\$ 4.29$ . Using 100 steps, the price obtained is $\$ 3.91$ .

The output from DerivaGem for this example is shown in Figure S21.4. The calculated price of the option is 42.07 cents. Using 100 time steps, the price obtained is 38.64. The option's delta is calculated from the tree is $\left( 7 9 . 9 7 1 - 1 1 . 4 1 9 \right) / \left( 4 7 6 . 4 9 8 - 3 3 5 . 7 8 3 \right) = 0 . 4 8 7$  

When 100 steps are used the estimate of the option's delta is 0.483.

In this case, the present value of the dividend is $2 e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 \times 0 . 1 2 5 } = 1 . 9 9 2 5$ . We first build a tree for $S _ { \scriptscriptstyle 0 } = 2 0 - 1 . 9 9 2 5 = 1 8 . 0 0 7 5$ , $K = 2 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 3$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2 5$ , and $T = 0 . 2 5$ with $\Delta t = 0 . 0 8 3 3 3$ . This gives Figure S21.5. For nodes between times 0 and 1.5 months, we then add the present value of the dividend to the stock price. The result is the tree in Figure S21.6. The price of the option calculated from the tree is 0.674. When 100 steps are used, the price obtained is 0.690.

In this case, $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 2 0$ , $K = 1 8$ , $r = 0 . 1 5$ , $\sigma = 0 . 4 0$ , $T = 1$ , and $\Delta t = 0 . 2 5$ . The parameters for the tree are:

The tree produced by DerivaGem for the American option is shown in Figure S21.7. The estimated value of the American option is $\$ 1.29$ .

Figure S21.8:  Tree to evaluate European option in Problem 21.13  

As shown in Figure S21.8, the same tree can be used to value a European put option with the same parameters. The estimated value of the European option is $\$ 1.14$ . The option parameters are $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 2 0$ , $K = 1 8$ , $r = 0 . 1 5$ , $\sigma = 0 . 4 0$ and $T = 1$  

$$
d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 2 0 / 1 8 ) + 0 . 1 5 + 0 . 4 0 ^ { 2 } / 2 } { 0 . 4 0 } } = 0 . 8 3 8 4
$$  

$$
d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 4 0 = 0 . 4 3 8 4
$$  

$$
N ( - d _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 2 0 0 9 ; ~ N ( - d _ { 2 } ) = 0 . 3 3 0 6
$$  

The true European put price is therefore,  

$$
1 8 e ^ { - 0 . 1 5 } \times 0 . 3 3 0 6 - 2 0 \times 0 . 2 0 0 9 = 1 . 1 0
$$  

This can also be obtained from DerivaGem. The control variate estimate of the American put price is therefore $1 . 2 9 + 1 . 1 0 - 1 . 1 4 = \ S 1 . 2 5$ .  

# 21.14  

In this case, $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 4 8 4$ , $K = 4 8 0$ , $r = 0 . 1 0$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2 5 q = 0 . 0 3$ , $T = 0 . 1 6 6 7$ , and $\Delta t = 0 . 0 4 1 6 7$  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { u = e ^ { \sigma \sqrt { \Delta t } } = e ^ { 0 . 2 5 \sqrt { 0 . 0 4 1 6 7 } } = 1 . 0 5 2 4 } \\ { d = \displaystyle \frac { 1 } { u } = 0 . 9 5 0 2 } \\ { a = e ^ { ( r - q ) \Delta t } = 1 . 0 0 2 9 2 } \\ { p = \displaystyle \frac { a - d } { u - d } = \frac { 1 . 0 0 2 9 - 0 . 9 5 0 2 } { 1 . 0 5 2 4 - 0 . 9 5 0 2 } = 0 . 5 1 6 } \end{array}
$$  

The tree produced by DerivaGem is shown in the Figure S21.9. The estimated price of the option is $\$ 14.93$ .

# 21.15  

First the delta of the American option is estimated in the usual way from the tree. Denote this by ${ \boldsymbol { \Delta } } _ { A } ^ { * }$ . Then the delta of a European option which has the same parameters as the American option is calculated in the same way using the same tree. Denote this by ${ \boldsymbol { \Delta } } _ { B } ^ { * }$ . Finally the true European delta, $\Delta _ { { _ B } }$ , is calculated using the formulas in Chapter 19. The control variate estimate of delta is then:  

$$
{ \Delta } _ { A } ^ { * } - { \Delta } _ { B } ^ { * } + { \Delta } _ { B }
$$  

# 21.16.  

In this case, a simulation requires two sets of samples from standardized normal distributions. The first is to generate the volatility movements. The second is to generate the stock price movements once the volatility movements are known. The control variate technique involves carrying out a second simulation on the assumption that the volatility is constant. The same random number stream is used to generate stock price movements as in the first simulation. An improved estimate of the option price is  

$$
f _ { A } ^ { * } - f _ { B } ^ { * } + f _ { B }
$$  

where $f _ { A } ^ { * }$ is the option value from the first simulation (when the volatility is stochastic), $f _ { B } ^ { * }$ is the option value from the second simulation (when the volatility is constant) and $f _ { B }$ is the true Black–Scholes–Merton value when the volatility is constant.  

To use the antithetic variable technique, two sets of samples from standardized normal distributions must be used for each of volatility and stock price. Denote the volatility samples by $\{ V _ { 1 } \}$ and $\{ V _ { 2 } \}$ and the stock price samples by $\{ S _ { 1 } \}$ and $\beta S _ { 2 } \} , \ \beta V _ { 1 } \}$ is antithetic to $\{ V _ { 2 } \}$ and $\{ S _ { 1 } \}$ is antithetic to $\{ S _ { 2 } \}$ . Thus, if  

then  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { \langle V _ { 1 } \rangle = + 0 . 8 3 , + 0 . 4 1 , - 0 . 2 1 . . . } } \\ { { } } \\ { { \langle V _ { 2 } \rangle = - 0 . 8 3 , - 0 . 4 1 , + 0 . 2 1 . . . } } \end{array}
$$  

Similarly for $\{ S _ { 1 } \}$ and $\{ S _ { 2 } \}$ .  

An efficient way of proceeding is to carry out six simulations in parallel:  

Simulation 1: Use $\{ S _ { 1 } \}$ with volatility constant Simulation 2: Use $\{ S _ { 2 } \}$ with volatility constant Simulation 3: Use $\{ S _ { 1 } \}$ and $\{ V _ { 1 } \}$ Simulation 4: Use $\{ S _ { 1 } \}$ and $\{ V _ { 2 } \}$ Simulation 5: Use $\{ S _ { 2 } \}$ and $\{ V _ { 1 } \}$ Simulation 6: Use $\{ S _ { 2 } \}$ and $\{ V _ { 2 } \}$  

If $f _ { i }$ is the option price from simulation $i$ , simulations 3 and 4 provide an estimate $0 . 5 ( f _ { 3 } + f _ { 4 } )$ for the option price. When the control variate technique is used, we combine this estimate with the result of simulation 1 to obtain $0 . 5 ( f _ { 3 } + f _ { 4 } ) - f _ { 1 } + f _ { B }$ as an estimate of the price where $f _ { B }$ is, as above, the Black–Scholes–Merton option price. Similarly, simulations 2, 5 and 6 provide an estimate $0 . 5 ( f _ { 5 } + f _ { 6 } ) - f _ { 2 } + f _ { B }$ . Overall the best estimate is:  

$$
0 . 5 [ 0 . 5 ( f _ { 3 } + f _ { 4 } ) - f _ { 1 } + f _ { B } + 0 . 5 ( f _ { 5 } + f _ { 6 } ) - f _ { 2 } + f _ { B } ]
$$  

21.17 For an American call option on a currency,  

$$
\frac { \partial f } { \partial t } { + } ( r - r _ { f } ) S \frac { \partial f } { \partial S } { + } \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } S ^ { 2 } \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } f } { \partial S ^ { 2 } } { = } r f
$$  

With the notation in the text, this becomes  

$$
\frac { f _ { i + 1 , j } - f _ { i j } } { \Delta t } + ( r - r _ { f } ) j \Delta S \frac { f _ { i , j + 1 } - f _ { i , j - 1 } } { 2 \Delta S } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } j ^ { 2 } \Delta S ^ { 2 } \frac { f _ { i , j + 1 } - 2 f _ { i , j } + f _ { i , j - 1 } } { \Delta S ^ { 2 } } = r f _ { i j }
$$  

for $j = 1 , 2 \dots M - 1$ and $i = 0 , 1 \dots \ N - 1$ . Rearranging terms, we obtain  

$$
a _ { j } f _ { i , j - 1 } + b _ { j } f _ { i j } + c _ { j } f _ { i , j + 1 } = f _ { i + 1 , j }
$$  

where  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { \displaystyle a _ { j } = \frac { 1 } { 2 } ( r - r _ { f } ) j \Delta t - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } j ^ { 2 } \Delta t } \\ { \displaystyle b _ { j } = 1 + \sigma ^ { 2 } j ^ { 2 } \Delta t + r \Delta t } \\ { \displaystyle c _ { j } = - \frac { 1 } { 2 } ( r - r _ { f } ) j \Delta t - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma ^ { 2 } j ^ { 2 } \Delta t } \end{array}
$$  

Equations (21.28), (21.29) and (21.30) become  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { f _ { N j } = \operatorname* { m a x } \left[ j \Delta S - K , 0 \right] \quad j = 0 , 1 . . . M } \\ { f _ { i 0 } = 0 \qquad i = 0 , 1 . . . N } \\ { f _ { i M } = M \Delta S - K \quad i = 0 , 1 . . . N } \end{array}
$$

In this case, $\Delta t = 0 . 2 5$ and $\sigma = 0 . 4$ so that  

$$
u = e ^ { 0 . 4 { \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } } } = 1 . 2 2 1 4
$$  

$$
d = \frac { 1 } { u } = 0 . 8 1 8 7
$$  

The futures prices provide estimates of the growth rate in copper in a risk-neutral world. During the first three months, this growth rate (with continuous compounding) is  

$$
4 \ln { \frac { 0 . 5 9 } { 0 . 6 0 } } = - 6 . 7 2 \% \ \mathrm { p e r \ a n n }
$$  

The parameter $p$ for the first three months is therefore,  

$$
\frac { e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 7 2 \times 0 . 2 5 } - 0 . 8 1 8 7 } { 1 . 2 2 1 4 - 0 . 8 1 8 7 } { = 0 . 4 0 8 8 }
$$  

The growth rate in copper is equal to $- 1 3 . 7 9 \%$ , $- 2 1 . 6 3 \%$ and $- 3 0 . 7 8 \%$ in the following three quarters. Therefore, the parameter $p$ for the second three months is  

$$
\frac { e ^ { - 0 . 1 3 7 9 \times 0 . 2 5 } - 0 . 8 1 8 7 } { 1 . 2 2 1 4 - 0 . 8 1 8 7 } { = } 0 . 3 6 6 0
$$  

For the third quarter, it is  

$$
\frac { e ^ { - 0 . 2 1 6 3 \times 0 . 2 5 } - 0 . 8 1 8 7 } { 1 . 2 2 1 4 - 0 . 8 1 8 7 } { = } 0 . 3 1 9 5
$$  

For the final quarter, it is  

$$
\frac { e ^ { - 0 . 3 0 7 8 \times 0 . 2 5 } - 0 . 8 1 8 7 } { 1 . 2 2 1 4 - 0 . 8 1 8 7 } { = } 0 . 2 6 6 3
$$

# 21.20  

In this problem, we use exactly the same tree for copper prices as in Problem 21.19. However, the values of the derivative are different. On the final nodes, the values of the derivative equal the square of the price of copper. On other nodes, they are calculated in the usual way. The current value of the security is $\$ 0.275$ (see Figure S21.11).

# 21.21  

Define $S _ { \ t { t } }$ as the current asset price, $S _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ as the highest asset price considered and $S _ { \mathrm { m i n } }$ as the lowest asset price considered. (In the example in the text $S _ { \mathrm { m i n } } = 0$ ). Let  

$$
Q _ { 1 } = \frac { S _ { \mathrm { m a x } } - S _ { t } } { \Delta S } \quad \mathrm { a n d } \quad Q _ { 2 } = \frac { S _ { t } - S _ { \mathrm { m i n } } } { \Delta S }
$$  

and let $N$ be the number of time intervals considered. From the triangular structure of the calculations in the explicit version of the finite difference method, we can see that the values assumed for the derivative security at $S = S _ { \mathrm { { m i n } } }$ and $S = S _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ affect the derivative's value if  

$$
N \geq \operatorname* { m a x } { ( Q _ { 1 } , Q _ { 2 } ) }

Other entries in columns L, A, H, and I are defined similarly. The estimate of the value of the option is the average of the values in the J column.

The basic approach is similar to that described in Section 21.8. The only difference is the boundary conditions. For a sufficiently small value of the stock price, $S _ { \mathrm { m i n } }$ , it can be assumed that conversion will never take place and the convertible can be valued as a straight bond. The highest stock price which needs to be considered, $S _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ , is $\$ 18$ . When this is reached, the value of the convertible bond is $\$ 36$ . At maturity, the convertible is worth the greater of $2 S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T }$ and $\$ 25$ where $S _ { T }$ is the stock price.  

The convertible can be valued by working backwards through the grid using either the explicit or the implicit finite difference method in conjunction with the boundary conditions. In formulas (21.25) and (21.32), the present value of the income on the convertible between time $t + i \Delta t$ and $t + ( i + 1 ) \Delta t$ discounted to time $t + i \Delta t$ must be added to the right-hand side. Chapter 27 considers the pricing of convertibles in more detail.

Suppose $x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 }$ , and $x _ { 3 }$ are random samples from three independent normal distributions. Random samples with the required correlation structure are $\varepsilon _ { 1 } , \varepsilon _ { 2 } , \varepsilon _ { 3 }$ where  

$$
\varepsilon _ { 1 } = x _ { 1 }
$$  

$$
\varepsilon _ { 2 } = \rho _ { 1 2 } x _ { 1 } + x _ { 2 } \sqrt { 1 - \rho _ { 1 2 } ^ { 2 } }

and

$$
\alpha _ { 1 } \rho _ { 1 2 } + \alpha _ { 2 } \sqrt { 1 - \rho _ { 1 2 } ^ { 2 } } = \rho _ { 2 3 }
$$  

and  

$$
\alpha _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + \alpha _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } + \alpha _ { 3 } ^ { 2 } = 1

This means that  

$$

$$  

$$
\alpha _ { 2 } = \frac { \rho _ { 2 3 } - \rho _ { 1 3 } \rho _ { 1 2 } } { \sqrt { 1 - \rho _ { 1 2 } ^ { 2 } } }

In this case, $F _ { 0 } = 8 . 5$ , $K = 9$ , $r = 0 . 1 2$ , $T = 1$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2 5$ , and $\Delta t = 0 . 2 5$ . The parameters for the tree are  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { u = e ^ { \sigma { \sqrt { \Delta t } } } = e ^ { 0 . 2 5 { \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } } } = 1 . 1 3 3 1 } } \\ { { \displaystyle d = { \frac { 1 } { u } } = 0 . 8 8 2 5 } } \\ { { a = 1 } } \end{array}
$$  

$$
p = { \frac { a - d } { u - d } } = { \frac { 1 - 0 . 8 8 2 5 } { 1 . 1 3 3 1 - 0 . 8 8 2 5 } } = 0 . 4 6 9

The tree output by DerivaGem for the American option is shown in Figure S21.13. The estimated value of the option is $\$ 0.596$ . The tree produced by DerivaGem for the European version of the option is shown in Figure S21.14. The estimated value of the option is $\$ 0.586$ . The Black–Scholes–Merton price of the option is $\$ 0.570$ . The control variate estimate of the price of the option is therefore,

21.27 (a) For the binomial model in Section 21.4, there are two equally likely changes in the  

logarithm of the stock price in a time step of length $\Delta t$ . These are $( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) \Delta t + \sigma \sqrt { \Delta t }$ and $( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) \Delta t - \sigma \sqrt { \Delta t }$ . The expected change in the logarithm of the stock price is $0 . 5 [ ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) \Delta t + \sigma \sqrt { \Delta t } ] + 0 . 5 [ ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) \Delta t - \sigma \sqrt { \Delta t } ] = ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) \Delta t$   
This is correct. The variance of the change in the logarithm of the stock price is   
$0 . 5 \sigma ^ { 2 } \Delta t + 0 . 5 \sigma ^ { 2 } \Delta t = \sigma ^ { 2 } \Delta t$   
This is correct.  

(b) For the trinomial tree model in Section 21.4, the change in the logarithm of the stock price in a time step of length $\Delta t$ is $+ \sigma \sqrt { 3 \Delta t } , 0$ , and $- \sigma \sqrt { 3 \Delta t }$ with probabilities  

$$
\sqrt { \frac { \Delta t } { 1 2 { \sigma } ^ { 2 } } } \Bigg ( r - \frac { \sigma ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \Bigg ) + \frac { 1 } { 6 } , \qquad \frac { 2 } { 3 } , \qquad - \sqrt { \frac { \Delta t } { 1 2 { \sigma } ^ { 2 } } } \Bigg ( r - \frac { \sigma ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \Bigg ) + \frac { 1 } { 6 }
$$  

The expected change is  

$$
{ \left( r - \frac { \sigma ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \right) } \Delta t
$$  

It variance is $\sigma ^ { 2 } \Delta t$ plus a term of order $\left( \Delta t \right) ^ { 2 }$ . These are correct.  

(c) To get the expected change in the logarithm of the stock price in time $\Delta t$ correct, we require  

$$
\frac 1 6 ( \ln u ) + \frac 2 3 ( \ln m ) + \frac 1 6 ( \ln d ) = \left( r - \frac { \sigma ^ { 2 } } 2 \right) \Delta t
$$  

The relationship $m ^ { 2 } = u d$ implies $\ln m = 0 . 5 ( \ln u + \ln d )$ so that the requirement becomes  

$$
\ln m = \left( r - \frac { \sigma ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \right) \Delta t
$$  

or  

$$
m = e ^ { ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } ) \Delta t }
$$  

The expected change in $\ln S$ is $\ln m$ . To get the variance of the change in the logarithm of the stock price in time $\Delta t$ correct, we require  

$$
\frac 1 6 ( \ln u - \ln m ) ^ { 2 } + \frac 1 6 ( \ln d - \ln m ) ^ { 2 } = \sigma ^ { 2 } \Delta t
$$  

Because $\ln u - \ln m = - ( \ln d - \ln m )$ it follows that  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { \ln u = \ln m + \sigma \sqrt { 3 \Delta t } } \\ { \ln d = \ln m - \sigma \sqrt { 3 \Delta t } } \end{array}
$$  

These results imply that  

$$
\begin{array} { c } { m = e ^ { ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } ) \Delta t } } \\ { u = e ^ { ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } ) \Delta t + \sigma \sqrt { 3 \Delta t } } } \\ { d = e ^ { ( r - \sigma ^ { 2 } ) \Delta t - \sigma \sqrt { 3 \Delta t } } } \end{array}
$$

From Figure 21.5, delta is $( 3 3 . 6 4 - 6 . 1 3 ) / ( 3 2 7 . 1 4 - 2 7 5 . 1 1 ) = 0 . 5 2 8 8$ . This is the rate of change   
of the option price with respect to the futures price. Gamma is   
$\frac { ( 5 6 . 7 3 - 1 2 . 9 0 ) / ( 3 5 6 . 7 3 - 3 0 0 ) - ( 1 2 . 9 0 - 0 ) / ( 3 0 0 - 2 5 2 . 2 9 ) } { 0 . 5 \times ( 3 5 6 . 7 3 - 2 5 2 . 2 9 ) } = 0 . 0 0 9$  

This is the rate of change of delta with respect to the futures price. Theta is $( 1 2 . 9 \mathrm { - } 1 9 . 1 6 ) / 0 . 1 6 6 6 7 \mathrm { = } \mathrm { - } 3 7 . 5 9$ per year or $- 0 . 1 0 2 9$ per calendar day.  

# 21.30  

Without early exercise, the option is worth 0.2535 at the lowest node at the 9 month point.   
With early exercise, it is worth 0.2552. The gain from early exercise is therefore 0.0017.  

# CHAPTER 22 Value at Risk  

# Practice Questions  

22.1   
The standard deviation of the daily change in the investment in each asset is $\$ 1,000$ . The   
variance of the portfolio's daily change is  

$$
1 , 0 0 0 ^ { 2 } + 1 , 0 0 0 ^ { 2 } + 2 \times 0 . 3 \times 1 , 0 0 0 \times 1 , 0 0 0 = 2 , 6 0 0 , 0 0 0
$$  

The standard deviation of the portfolio's daily change is the square root of this or $\$ 1,612.45$ . The standard deviation of the 5-day change is  

$$
1 , 6 1 2 . 4 5 \times \sqrt { 5 } = \ S 3 , 6 0 5 . 5 5
$$  

Because $N ^ { - 1 } ( 0 . 0 1 ) = 2 . 3 2 6$ , $1 \%$ of a normal distribution lies more than 2.326 standard deviations below the mean. The 5-day 99 percent value at risk is therefore $2 . 3 2 6 \times 3 . 6 0 5 . 5 5 =$ $\$ 8,388$ . The 5-day $9 9 \%$ ES is  

$$
\frac { 3 6 0 5 . 5 5 \times e ^ { - 2 . 3 2 6 ^ { 2 } / 2 } } { \sqrt { 2 \pi \times 0 . 0 1 } } = 9 , 6 1 7
$$  

# 22.2  

The three alternative procedures mentioned in the chapter for handling interest rates when the model building approach is used to calculate VaR involve (a) the use of the duration model, (b) the use of cash flow mapping, and (c) the use of principal components analysis. When historical simulation is used, we need to assume that the change in the zero-coupon yield curve between Day $m$ and Day $m + 1$ is the same as that between Day $i$ and Day $i + 1$ for different values of $i$ . In the case of a LIBOR, the zero curve is usually calculated from deposit rates, Eurodollar futures quotes, and swap rates. We can assume that the percentage change in each of these between Day $m$ and Day $m + 1$ is the same as that between Day $i$ and Day $i + 1$ . In the case of a Treasury curve, it is usually calculated from the yields on Treasury instruments. Again, we can assume that the percentage change in each of these between Day $m$ and Day $m + 1$ is the same as that between Day $i$ and Day $i + 1$ .  

# 22.3  

The approximate relationship between the daily change in the portfolio value, $\Delta P$ , and the daily change in the exchange rate, $\Delta S$ , is  

$$
\Delta P = 5 6 \Delta S
$$  

The percentage daily change in the exchange rate, $\Delta x$ , equals $\Delta S / 1 . 5$ . It follows that  

$$
\Delta P = 5 6 \times 1 . 5 \Delta x
$$  

or  

$$
\Delta P = 8 4 \Delta x
$$  

The standard deviation of $\Delta x$ equals the daily volatility of the exchange rate, or 0.7 percent. The standard deviation of $\Delta P$ is therefore $8 4 \times 0 . 0 0 7 = 0 . 5 8 8$ . It follows that the 10-day 99 percent VaR for the portfolio is  

$$
0 . 5 8 8 \times 2 . 3 3 \times \sqrt { 1 0 } = 4 . 3 3
$$  

# 22.4 The relationship is  

$$
\Delta P = 5 6 \times 1 . 5 \Delta x + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \times 1 . 5 ^ { 2 } \times 1 6 . 2 \times { \Delta x } ^ { 2 }
$$  

$$
\Delta P = 8 4 \Delta x + 1 8 . 2 2 5 \Delta x ^ { 2 }
$$  

# 22.5  

The factors calculated from a principal components analysis are uncorrelated. The daily variance of the portfolio is  

$$
6 ^ { 2 } \times 2 0 ^ { 2 } + 4 ^ { 2 } \times 8 ^ { 2 } = 1 5 , 4 2 4
$$  

and the daily standard deviation is ${ \sqrt { 1 5 , 4 2 4 } } = \$ 124 .19$ . Since $N ( - 1 . 2 8 2 ) = 0 . 9$ , the 5-day $90 \%$ value at risk is (assuming factors are normally distributed)  

$$
1 2 4 . 1 9 \times \sqrt { 5 } \times 1 . 2 8 2 = \ S 3 5 6 . 0 1
$$  

# 22.6  

The linear model assumes that the percentage daily change in each market variable has a normal probability distribution. The historical simulation model assumes that the probability distribution observed for the percentage daily changes in the market variables in the past is the probability distribution that will apply over the next day.  

# 22.7  

The forward contract can be regarded as the exchange of a foreign zero-coupon bond for a domestic zero-coupon bond. Each of these can be mapped in zero-coupon bonds with standard maturities.  

# 22.8  

Value at risk is the loss that is expected to be exceeded $( 1 0 0 - X ) \%$ of the time in $N$ days for specified parameter values, $X$ and $N$ . Expected shortfall is the expected loss conditional that the loss is greater than the Value at Risk.  

# 22.9  

The change in the value of an option is not linearly related to the change in the value of the underlying variables. When the change in the values of underlying variables is normal, the change in the value of the option is non-normal. The linear model assumes that it is normal and is, therefore, only an approximation.  

# 22.10  

The contract is a long position in a sterling bond combined with a short position in a dollar bond. The value of the sterling bond is $1 . 5 3 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 }$ or $\$ 1.492$ million. The value of the dollar bond is $1 . 5 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 }$ or $\$ 1.463$ million. The variance of the change in the value of the contract in one day is  

$$
1 . 4 9 2 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 0 0 0 6 ^ { 2 } + 1 . 4 6 3 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 0 0 0 5 ^ { 2 } - 2 \times 0 . 8 \times 1 . 4 9 2 \times 0 . 0 0 0 6 \times 1 . 4 6 3 \times 0 . 0 0 0 5
$$  

The standard deviation is therefore $\$ 0.000537$ million. The 10-day $9 9 \%$ VaR is $0 . 0 0 0 5 3 7 \times \sqrt { 1 0 } \times 2 . 3 3 = \mathcal { S } 0 . 0 0 3 9 6$ million.  

22.11 If we assume only one factor, the model is  

$$
\Delta P = - 1 . 9 9 f _ { 1 } ~ \
$$  

The standard deviation of $f _ { 1 }$ is 11.54. The standard deviation of $\Delta P$ is therefore $1 . 9 9 \times 1 1 . 5 4 = 2 2 . 9 6 5$ and the 1-day 99 percent value at risk is $2 2 . 9 6 5 { \times } 2 . 3 2 6 { = } 5 3 . 4 2$ If we assume three factors, our exposure to the third factor is  

$1 0 \times ( 0 . 3 7 6 ) + 4 \times ( 0 . 0 0 6 ) - 8 \times ( - 0 . 3 3 2 ) - 7 \times ( - 0 . 3 4 9 ) + 2 \times ( - 0 . 1 5 3 ) = 8 . 5 8$ The model is therefore,  

$$
\Delta P = - 1 . 9 9 f _ { 1 } - 3 . 0 6 f _ { 2 } + 8 . 5 8 f _ { 3 }
$$  

The variance of $\Delta P$ is  

$$
1 . 9 9 ^ { 2 } \times 1 1 . 5 4 ^ { 2 } + 3 . 0 6 ^ { 2 } \times 3 . 5 5 ^ { 2 } + 8 . 5 8 ^ { 2 } \times 1 . 7 8 ^ { 2 } = 8 7 8 . 6 2
$$  

The standard deviation of $\Delta P$ is  the square root of this or 29.64 and the 1-day $9 9 \%$ value at risk is $2 9 . 6 4 \times \ 2 . 3 2 6 = { \tt S } 6 8 . 9 5$ ..  

The example illustrates that the relative importance of different factors depends on the portfolio being considered. Normally, the second factor is more important than the third, but in this case it is less important.  

# 22.12  

The delta of the options is the rate of change of the value of the options with respect to the price of the asset. When the asset price increases by a small amount, the value of the options decrease by 30 times this amount. The gamma of the options is the rate of change of their delta with respect to the price of the asset. When the asset price increases by a small amount, the delta of the portfolio decreases by five times this amount.  

By entering 20 for $S$ , $1 \%$ for the volatility per day, $- 3 0$ for delta, $- 5$ for gamma, and recomputing, we see that $E ( \Delta P ) = - 0 . 1 0$ , $E ( \Delta P ^ { 2 } ) = 3 6 . 0 3$ , and $E ( \Delta P ^ { 3 } ) = - 3 2 . 4 1 5$ . The 1day, $9 9 \%$ VaR given by the software for the quadratic approximation is 14.5. This is a $9 9 \%$ 1-day VaR. The VaR is calculated using the formulas in footnote 9 and the results in Technical Note 10.  

# 22.13  

Define $\sigma$ as the volatility per year, $\Delta \sigma$ as the change in $\sigma$ in one day, and $\Delta w$ and the proportional change in $\sigma$ in one day. We measure in $\sigma$ as a multiple of $1 \%$ so that the current value of $\sigma$ is $1 \times \sqrt { 2 5 2 } = 1 5 . 8 7$ . The delta-gamma-vega model is  

$$
{ \Delta P = - 3 0 \Delta S - . 5 \times 5 \times ( \Delta S ) ^ { 2 } - 2 \Delta \sigma }
$$  

or  

$$
{ \Delta P = - 3 0 \times 2 0 \Delta x - 0 . 5 \times 5 \times 2 0 ^ { 2 } ( \Delta x ) ^ { 2 } - 2 \times 1 5 . 8 7 \Delta w }
$$  

which simplifies to  

$$
\Delta P = - 6 0 0 \Delta x - 1 , 0 0 0 ( \Delta x ) ^ { 2 } - 3 1 . 7 4 \Delta w
$$  

The change in the portfolio value now depends on two market variables. Once the daily volatility of $\sigma$ and the correlation between $\sigma$ and $S$ have been estimated, we can estimate moments of $\Delta P$ and use a Cornish–Fisher expansion.  

# 22.14  

The $9 5 \%$ one-day VaR is the 25th worst loss. This is $\$ 163,420$ . The $9 5 \%$ one-day ES is the average of the 25 largest losses. It is $\$ 323,490$ . The $9 7 \%$ one-day VaR is the 15th worst loss. This is $\$ 229,683$ . The $9 7 \%$ one-day ES is the average of the 15 largest losses. It is $\$ 415,401$ . The model building approach gives the $9 5 \%$ one-day $\mathrm { V a R }$ as $\$ 197,425$ and the $9 5 \%$ one-day ES as $\$ 247,579$ . The model building approach gives the $9 7 \%$ one-day VaR as $\$ 225,744$ and the $9 5 \%$ one-day ES as $\$ 272,226$ .  

# 22.15  

For the historical simulation approach, in the "Scenarios" worksheet the portfolio investments are changed to 2,500 in cells L2:O2. The losses are then sorted from the largest to the smallest. The fifth worst loss is $\$ 394,437$ . This is the one-day $9 9 \%$ VaR. The average of the five worst losses is $\$ 633,716$ . This is the one-day $9 9 \%$ ES. For the model building approach, we make a similar change to the equal weights sheet and find that the value at risk is $\$ 275,757$ while the expected shortfall is $\$ 315,926$ .  

# 22.16  

The change in the value of the portfolio for a small change $\Delta y$ in the yield is approximately $- D B \Delta y$ where $D$ is the duration and $B$ is the value of the portfolio. It follows that the standard deviation of the daily change in the value of the bond portfolio equals $D B \sigma _ { _ { y } }$ where $\sigma _ { _ { y } }$ is the standard deviation of the daily change in the yield. In this case, $D = 5 . 2$ , $B = 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0$ , and $\sigma _ { _ y } = 0 . 0 0 0 9$ so that the standard deviation of the daily change in the value of the bond portfolio is  

$$
5 . 2 \times 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 \times 0 . 0 0 0 9 = 2 8 , 0 8 0
$$  

The 20-day $90 \%$ VaR for the portfolio is $1 . 2 8 2 \times 2 8 , 0 8 0 \times \sqrt { 2 0 } = 1 6 0 , 9 9 0$ or $\$ 160,990$ . This approach assumes that only parallel shifts in the term structure can take place. Equivalently, it assumes that all rates are perfectly correlated or that only one factor drives term structure movements. Alternative more accurate approaches described in the chapter are (a) cash flow mapping, and (b) a principal components analysis.  

# 22.17  

An approximate relationship between the daily change in the value of the portfolio, $\Delta P$ and the proportional daily change in the value of the asset $\Delta x$ is  

$$
\Delta P = 1 0 \times 1 2 \Delta x = 1 2 0 \Delta x
$$  

The standard deviation of $\Delta x$ is 0.02. It follows that the standard deviation of $\Delta P$ is 2.4. The 1-day $9 5 \%$ VaR is $2 . 4 { \times } 1 . 6 5 { = } \$ 3 . 9 6$ .  The quadratic relationship is  

$$
\Delta P = 1 0 \times 1 2 \Delta x + 0 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 } \times ( - 2 . 6 ) \Delta x ^ { 2 }
$$  

or  

$$
\Delta P = 1 2 0 \Delta x - 1 3 0 \Delta x ^ { 2 }
$$  

This could be used in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation. We would sample values for $\Delta x$ and use this equation to convert the $\Delta x$ samples to $\Delta P$ samples.  

# 22.18 The cash flows are as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Year</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>2-yr bond</td><td>5</td><td>105</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3-yr bond</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>105</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5-yr bond</td><td>-5</td><td>-5</td><td>-5</td><td>-5</td><td>-105</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>5</td><td>105</td><td>100</td><td>-5</td><td>-105</td></tr><tr><td>Present Value</td><td>4.756</td><td>95.008</td><td>86.071</td><td>-4.094</td><td>-81.774</td></tr><tr><td>Impact of 1bp change</td><td>-0.0005</td><td>-0.0190</td><td>-0.0258</td><td>0.0016</td><td>0.0409</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The duration relationship is used to calculate the last row of the table. When the one-year rate increases by one basis point, the value of the cash flow in year 1 decreases by $1 \times 0 . 0 0 0 1 \times$ $4 . 7 5 6 = 0 . 0 0 0 5$ ; when the two year rate increases by one basis point, the value of the cash flow in year 2 decreases by $2 { \times } 0 . 0 0 0 1 { \times } 9 5 . 0 0 8 = 0 . 0 1 9 0$ ; and so on.  

The sensitivity to the first factor is   
− $0 . 0 0 0 5 \times 0 . 0 8 3 - 0 . 0 1 9 0 \times 0 . 2 1 0 - 0 . 0 2 5 8 \times 0 . 2 8 6 + 0 . 0 0 1 6 \times 0 . 3 3 6 + 0 . 0 4 0 9 \times 0 . 3 8 6$ or 0.004915. (We assume that PC1 for 4 years is the average of that for 3 and 5 years.) Similarly, the sensitivity to the second and third factors are 0.007496 and $- 0 . 0 2 1 4 8$ . Assuming one factor, the standard deviation of the one-day change in the portfolio value is $0 . 0 0 4 9 1 5 \times 1 1 . 5 4 = 0 . 0 5 6 7 2$ . The 20-day $9 5 \%$ VaR is therefore $0 . 0 5 6 7 2 \times 1 . 6 4 5 \sqrt { 2 0 } =$ 0.417. Assuming two factors, the variance of the one-day change in the portfolio value is $0 . 0 0 4 9 1 5 ^ { 2 } \times 1 1 . 5 4 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 0 0 7 4 9 6 ^ { 2 } \times \dot { 3 } . 5 5 ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 3 9 2 \bar { 5 }$   
so that the standard deviation is 0.06267.   
The 20-day $9 5 \%$ VaR is therefore $0 . 0 6 2 6 7 \times 1 . 6 4 5 \sqrt { 2 0 } = 0 . 4 6 1 .$   
Assuming three factors, the variance of the one-day change in the portfolio value is $0 . 0 0 4 9 1 5 ^ { 2 } \times 1 1 . 5 4 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 0 0 7 4 9 6 ^ { 2 } \times 3 . 5 \dot { 5 } ^ { 2 } + 0 . \dot { 0 2 } 1 4 8 ^ { 2 } \times 1 . \dot { 7 } 8 ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 5 3 8 7$ so that the standard deviation is 0.07339.   
The 20-day $9 5 \%$ VaR is therefore $0 . 0 7 3 3 9 \times 1 . 6 4 5 \sqrt { 2 0 } = 0 . 5 4 0 .$

This assignment is useful for consolidating students' understanding of alternative approaches to calculating $\operatorname { V a R }$ , but it is calculation intensive. Realistically, students need some programming skills to make the assignment feasible. My answer follows the usual practice of assuming that the 10-day $9 9 \%$ value at risk is $\sqrt { 1 0 }$ times the 1-day $9 9 \%$ value at risk. Some students may try to calculate a 10-day VaR directly, which is fine.  

(a) From DerivaGem, the values of the two option positions are $- 5 . 4 1 3$ and –1.014. The deltas are $- 0 . 5 8 9$ and 0.284, respectively. An approximate linear model relating the change in the portfolio value to proportional change, $\Delta x _ { \mathrm { 1 } }$ , in the first stock price and the proportional change, $\Delta x _ { 2 }$ , in the second stock price is  

$$
\Delta P = - 0 . 5 8 9 \times 5 0 \Delta x _ { 1 } + 0 . 2 8 4 \times 2 0 \Delta x _ { 2 }
$$  

or  

$$
\Delta P { = } { - } 2 9 . 4 5 \Delta x _ { 1 } + 5 . 6 8 \Delta x _ { 2 }
$$  

The daily volatility of the two stocks are $0 . 2 8 / \sqrt { 2 5 2 } = 0 . 0 1 7 6$ and $0 . 2 5 / \sqrt { 2 5 2 } = 0 . 0 1 5 7$ , respectively. The one-day variance of $\Delta P$ is $2 9 . 4 5 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 0 1 7 6 ^ { 2 } + 5 . 6 8 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 0 1 5 7 ^ { 2 } - 2 \times 2 9 . 4 5 \times 0 . 0 1 7 6 \times 5 . 6 8 \times 0 . 0 1 5 7 \times 0 . 4 = 0 . 2 3 9 6$ The one day standard deviation is, therefore, 0.4895 and the 10-day $9 9 \%$ VaR is $2 . 3 3 \times \sqrt { 1 0 } \times 0 . 4 8 9 5 = 3 . 6 1$ .  

(b) In the partial simulation approach, we simulate changes in the stock prices over a oneday period (building in the correlation) and then use the quadratic approximation to calculate the change in the portfolio value on each simulation trial. The one percentile point of the probability distribution of portfolio value changes turns out to be 1.22. The 10-day $9 9 \%$ value at risk is, therefore, $1 . 2 2 { \sqrt { 1 0 } }$ or about 3.86.  

(c) In the full simulation approach, we simulate changes in the stock price over one-day (building in the correlation) and revalue the portfolio on each simulation trial. The results are very similar to (b) and the estimate of the 10-day $9 9 \%$ value at risk is about  

3.86.  

# 22.20  

If the loss has mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ , VaR with $9 9 \%$ confidence is $\mu + 2 . 3 2 6 \sigma$ . ES with $9 7 . 5 \%$ confidence is  

$$
\mu + \frac { \sigma e ^ { - 1 . 9 6 ^ { 2 } / 2 } } { \sqrt { 2 \pi } \times 0 . 0 2 5 } = \mu + 2 . 3 3 7 \sigma
$$  

# CHAPTER 23 Estimating Volatilities and Correlations  

# Practice Questions  

# 23.1  

Define $u _ { i }$ as $( S _ { i } - S _ { i - 1 } ) / S _ { i - 1 }$ , where $S _ { i }$ is value of a market variable on day $i$ . In the EWMA model, the variance rate of the market variable (i.e., the square of its volatility) calculated for day $n$ is a weighted average of the $u _ { n - i } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { ~ } ^ { , } \mathrm { ~ s ~ } ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , \ldots )$ . For some constant $\lambda$ ( $\left( 0 < \lambda < 1 \right)$ , the weight given to $u _ { n - i - 1 } ^ { 2 }$ is $\lambda$ times the weight given to $u _ { n - i } ^ { 2 }$ . The volatility estimated for day $n , \sigma _ { n }$ , is related to the volatility estimated for day $n { - } 1$ , $\sigma _ { n - 1 }$ , by  

$$
\sigma _ { n } ^ { 2 } = \lambda \sigma _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 } + ( 1 - \lambda ) u _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 }
$$  

This formula shows that the EWMA model has one very attractive property. To calculate the volatility estimate for day $n$ , it is sufficient to know the volatility estimate for day $n { - } 1$ and u 1 .  

# 23.2  

The EWMA model produces a forecast of the daily variance rate for day $n$ which is a weighted average of (i) the forecast for day $n { - } 1$ , and (ii) the square of the proportional change on day $n { - } 1$ . The GARCH (1,1) model produces a forecast of the daily variance for day $n$ which is a weighted average of (i) the forecast for day $n { - } 1$ , (ii) the square of the proportional change on day $n - 1$ , and (iii) a long run average variance rate. GARCH (1,1) adapts the EWMA model by giving some weight to a long run average variance rate. Whereas the EWMA has no mean reversion, GARCH (1,1) is consistent with a meanreverting variance rate model.  

# 23.3  

In this case, $\sigma _ { n - 1 } = 0 . 0 1 5$ and $u _ { n } = 0 . 5 / 3 0 = 0 . 0 1 6 6 7$ , so that equation (23.7) gives  

$$
\sigma _ { n } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 4 \times 0 . 0 1 5 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 0 6 \times 0 . 0 1 6 6 7 ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 0 2 2 8 1
$$  

The volatility estimate on day $n$ is therefore $\sqrt { 0 . 0 0 0 2 2 8 1 } = 0 . 0 1 5 1 0 3$ or $1 . 5 1 0 3 \%$ .  

# 23.4  

Reducing $\lambda$ from 0.95 to 0.85 means that more weight is put on recent observations of $u _ { i } ^ { 2 }$ and less weight is given to older observations. Volatilities calculated with $\lambda = 0 . 8 5$ will react more quickly to new information and will "bounce around" much more than volatilities calculated with $\lambda = 0 . 9 5$ .  

# 23.5  

The volatility per day is $3 0 / \sqrt { 2 5 2 } = 1 . 8 9 \%$ . There is a $9 9 \%$ chance that a normally distributed variable will be within 2.57 standard deviations. We are therefore $9 9 \%$ confident that the daily change will be less than $2 . 5 7 { \times } 1 . 8 9 { = } 4 . 8 6 \%$ .  

# 23.6  

The weight given to the long-run average variance rate is $1 - \alpha - \beta$ and the long-run average variance rate is $\omega / ( 1 - \alpha - \beta ) .$ Increasing $\omega$ increases the long-run average variance rate; increasing $\alpha$ increases the weight given to the most recent data item, reduces the weight given to the long-run average variance rate, and increases the level of the long-run average variance rate. Increasing $\beta$ increases the weight given to the previous variance estimate, reduces the weight given to the long-run average variance rate, and increases the level of the long-run average variance rate.  

# 23.7  

The proportional daily change is $- 0 . 0 0 5 / 1 . 5 0 0 0 = - 0 . 0 0 3 3 3 3$ . The current daily variance estimate is $0 . 0 0 6 ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 0 0 3 6$ . The new daily variance estimate is $0 . 9 \times 0 . 0 0 0 0 3 6 + 0 . 1 \times 0 . 0 0 3 3 3 ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 0 0 3 3 5 1 1$ The new volatility is the square root of this. It is 0.00579 or $0 . 5 7 9 \%$ .  

23.8 With the usual notation $u _ { n - 1 } = 2 0 / 3 0 4 0 = 0 . 0 0 6 5 7 9$ so that the new variance is  

$$
0 . 0 0 0 0 0 2 + 0 . 0 6 \times 0 . 0 0 6 5 7 9 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 9 2 \times 0 . 0 1 ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 0 0 9 6 6 0
$$  

so that $\sigma _ { n } = 0 . 0 0 9 8 3$ . The new volatility estimate is therefore $0 . 9 8 3 \%$ per day.  

23.9  

(a) The volatilities and correlation imply that the current estimate of the covariance is $0 . 2 5 { \times } 0 . 0 1 6 { \times } 0 . 0 2 5 { \times } 0 . 0 0 0 1$ .   
(b) If the prices of the assets at close of trading are $\$ 20.5$ and $\$ 40.5$ , the proportional changes are $0 . 5 / 2 0 = 0 . 0 2 5$ and $0 . 5 / 4 0 = 0 . 0 1 2 5$ . The new covariance estimate is $0 . 9 5 \times 0 . 0 0 0 1 + 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 0 2 5 \times 0 . 0 1 2 5 = 0 . 0 0 0 1 1 0 6$ The new variance estimate for asset A is $0 . 9 5 \times 0 . 0 1 6 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 0 2 5 ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 0 2 7 4 4 5$ so that the new volatility is 0.0166. The new variance estimate for asset $\mathbf { B }$ is $0 . 9 5 \times 0 . 0 2 5 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 0 1 2 5 ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 0 6 0 1 5 6 2$ so that the new volatility is 0.0245. The new correlation estimate is $\frac { 0 . 0 0 0 1 1 0 6 } { 0 . 0 1 6 6 \times 0 . 0 2 4 5 } = 0 . 2 7 2$  

# 23.10  

The long-run average variance rate is $\omega / ( 1 - \alpha - \beta )$ or $0 . 0 0 0 0 0 4 / 0 . 0 3 = 0 . 0 0 0 1 3 3 3$ . The long-run average volatility is $\sqrt { 0 . 0 0 0 1 3 3 3 }$ or $1 . 1 5 5 \%$ . The equation describing the way the variance rate reverts to its long-run average is equation (23.13)  

$$
E [ \sigma _ { n + k } ^ { 2 } ] { = } V _ { L } + ( \alpha + \beta ) ^ { k } ( \sigma _ { n } ^ { 2 } - V _ { L } )
$$  

In this case,  

$$
E [ \sigma _ { n + k } ^ { 2 } ] = 0 . 0 0 0 1 3 3 3 + 0 . 9 7 ^ { k } ( \sigma _ { n } ^ { 2 } - 0 . 0 0 0 1 3 3 3 )
$$  

If the current volatility is $20 \%$ per year, $\sigma _ { n } = 0 . 2 / \sqrt { 2 5 2 } = 0 . 0 1 2 6$ . The expected variance rate in 20 days is  

$$
0 . 0 0 0 1 3 3 3 + 0 . 9 7 ^ { 2 0 } ( 0 . 0 1 2 6 ^ { 2 } - 0 . 0 0 0 1 3 3 3 ) = 0 . 0 0 0 1 4 7 1
$$  

The expected volatility in 20 days is therefore ${ \sqrt { 0 . 0 0 0 1 4 7 1 } } = 0 . 0 1 2 1$ or $1 . 2 1 \%$ per day.  

# 23.11  

Using the notation in the text $\sigma _ { u , n - 1 } = 0 . 0 1$ and $\sigma _ { \nu , n - 1 } = 0 . 0 1 2$ and the most recent estimate of the covariance between the asset returns is $\mathbf { c o v } _ { n - 1 } = 0 . 0 1 { \times } 0 . 0 1 2 { \times } 0 . 5 0 = 0 . 0 0 0 0 6$ . The variable $u _ { n - 1 } = 1 / 3 0 = 0 . 0 3 3 3 3$ and the variable $\nu _ { { n - 1 } } = 1 / 5 0 = 0 . 0 2$ . The new estimate of the covariance, $\mathbf { c o v } _ { n }$ , is  

$$
0 . 0 0 0 0 0 1 + 0 . 0 4 \times 0 . 0 3 3 3 \times 0 . 0 2 + 0 . 9 4 \times 0 . 0 0 0 0 6 = 0 . 0 0 0 0 8 4 1
$$  

The new estimate of the variance of the first asset, $\sigma _ { u , n } ^ { 2 }$ 2 is  

$$
0 . 0 0 0 0 0 3 + 0 . 0 4 \times 0 . 0 3 3 3 3 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 9 4 \times 0 . 0 1 ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 0 1 4 1 4
$$  

so that $\sigma _ { u , n } = \sqrt { 0 . 0 0 0 1 4 1 4 } = 0 . 0 1 1 8 9$ or $1 . 1 8 9 \%$ . The new estimate of the variance of the second asset, $\sigma _ { \nu , n } ^ { 2 }$ is  

$$
0 . 0 0 0 0 0 3 + 0 . 0 4 \times 0 . 0 2 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 9 4 \times 0 . 0 1 2 ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 0 1 5 4 4
$$  

so that $\sigma _ { \nu , n } = { \sqrt { 0 . 0 0 0 1 5 4 4 } } = 0 . 0 1 2 4 2$ or $1 . 2 4 2 \%$ . The new estimate of the correlation between the assets is therefore $0 . 0 0 0 0 8 4 1 / ( 0 . 0 1 1 8 9 \times 0 . 0 1 2 4 2 ) = 0 . 5 6 9 .$  

# 23.12  

The FTSE expressed in dollars is $X Y$ where $X$ is the FTSE expressed in sterling and $Y$ is the exchange rate (value of one pound in dollars). Define $x _ { i }$ as the proportional change in $X$ on day $i$ and $y _ { i }$ as the proportional change in $Y$ on day $i$ . The proportional change in $X Y$ is approximately $x _ { i } + y _ { i }$ . The standard deviation of $x _ { i }$ is 0.018 and the standard deviation of $y _ { i }$ is 0.009. The correlation between the two is 0.4. The variance of $x _ { i } + y _ { i }$ is therefore  

$$
0 . 0 1 8 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 0 0 9 ^ { 2 } + 2 \times 0 . 0 1 8 \times 0 . 0 0 9 \times 0 . 4 = 0 . 0 0 0 5 3 4 6
$$  

so that the volatility of $x _ { i } + y _ { i }$ is 0.0231 or $2 . 3 1 \%$ . This is the volatility of the FTSE expressed in dollars. Note that it is greater than the volatility of the FTSE expressed in sterling. This is the impact of the positive correlation. When the FTSE increases, the value of sterling measured in dollars also tends to increase. This creates an even bigger increase in the value of FTSE measured in dollars. Similarly, for a decrease in the FTSE.  

# 23.13  

Continuing with the notation in Problem 23.12, define $z _ { i }$ as the proportional change in the value of the S&P 500 on day $i$ . The covariance between $x _ { i }$ and $z _ { i }$ is $0 . 7 { \times } 0 . 0 1 8 { \times } 0 . 0 1 6 = 0 . 0 0 0 2 0 1 6$ . The covariance between $y _ { i }$ and $z _ { i }$ is $0 . 3 { \times } 0 . 0 0 9 { \times } 0 . 0 1 6 { = } 0 . 0 0 0 0 4 3 2$ . The covariance between  and $z _ { i }$ equals the covariance between $x _ { i }$ and $z _ { i }$ plus the covariance between $x _ { i } + y _ { i } \ y _ { i }$ and $z _ { i }$ . It is $0 . 0 0 0 2 0 1 6 + 0 . 0 0 0 0 4 3 2 = 0 . 0 0 0 2 4 4 8$  

The correlation between $x _ { i } + y _ { i }$ and $z _ { i }$ is  

$$
\frac { 0 . 0 0 0 2 4 4 8 } { 0 . 0 1 6 \times 0 . 0 2 3 1 } = 0 . 6 6 2
$$  

Note that the volatility of the S&P 500 drops out in this calculation.  

# 23.14  

so that  

$$
\sigma _ { n } ^ { 2 } = \omega V _ { L } + \alpha u _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 } + \beta \sigma _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 }
$$$$

\begin{array} { c } { { \sigma _ { n } = \omega v _ { _ { L } } + \alpha u _ { n - 1 } + \rho \sigma _ { n - 1 } } } \\ { { { } } } \\ { { { \displaystyle \sigma _ { n } ^ { 2 } = ( 1 - \alpha - \beta ) V _ { _ L } + \alpha u _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 } + \beta \sigma _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 } } } } \\ { { { \displaystyle \sigma _ { n } ^ { 2 } - \sigma _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 } = ( 1 - \alpha - \beta ) ( V _ { _ L } - \sigma _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 } ) + \alpha ( u _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 } - \sigma _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 } ) } } } \end{array}

$$  

The variable $u _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 }$ has a mean of $\sigma _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 }$ and a variance of  

$$

E ( u _ { n - 1 } ) ^ { 4 } - [ E ( u _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 } ) ] ^ { 2 } = 2 \sigma _ { n - 1 } ^ { 4 }

$$  

The standard deviation of $u _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 }$ is $\sqrt { 2 } \sigma _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 }$  

We can write $\Delta V = \sigma _ { n } ^ { 2 } - \sigma _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 }$ and $V = \sigma _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 }$ . Substituting for $u _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 }$ into the equation for $\sigma _ { n } ^ { 2 } - \sigma _ { n - 1 } ^ { 2 }$ , we get  

$$

\Delta V = a ( V _ { L } - V ) + Z

$$  

where $Z$ is a variable with mean zero and standard deviation $\alpha \sqrt { 2 } V$ . This equation defines the change in the variance over one day. It is consistent with the stochastic process  

$$

d V = a ( V _ { L } - V ) d t + \alpha \sqrt { 2 } V d z

$$  

or  

$$

d V = a ( V _ { L } - V ) d t + \xi V d z

$$  

when time is measured in days.  

Discretizing the process, we obtain  

$$

\Delta V = a ( V _ { L } - V ) \Delta t + \xi V \varepsilon { \sqrt { \Delta t } }

$$  

where $\varepsilon$ is a random sample from a standard normal distribution.  

Note that we are not assuming $Z$ is normally distributed. It is the sum of many small changes $\xi V \varepsilon \sqrt { \Delta t }$ .  

When time is measured in years,  

$$

\Delta V = a ( V _ { L } - V ) 2 5 2 \Delta t + \xi V \varepsilon \sqrt { 2 5 2 } \sqrt { \Delta t }

$$  

and the process for $V$ is  

$$

d V = 2 5 2 a ( V _ { L } - V ) d t + \xi V \sqrt { 2 5 2 } d z

$$

The proportional change in the price of gold is $- 4 / 6 0 0 { = } - 0 . 0 0 6 6 7$ . Using the EWMA   
model, the variance is updated to $0 . 9 4 \times 0 . 0 1 3 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 0 6 \times 0 . 0 0 6 6 7 ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 0 1 6 1 5 3$   
so that the new daily volatility is ${ \sqrt { 0 . 0 0 0 1 6 1 5 3 } } = 0 . 0 1 2 7 1$ or $1 . 2 7 1 \%$ per day. Using GARCH   
(1,1), the variance is updated to $0 . 0 0 0 0 0 2 + 0 . 9 4 \times 0 . 0 1 3 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 0 4 \times 0 . 0 0 6 6 7 ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 0 1 6 2 6 4$   
so that the new daily volatility is ${ \sqrt { 0 . 0 0 0 1 6 2 6 4 } } = 0 . 1 2 7 5$ or $1 . 2 7 5 \%$ per day.  

# 23.18  

The proportional change in the price of silver is zero. Using the EWMA model, the variance is updated to  

$$

0 . 9 4 \times 0 . 0 1 5 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 0 6 \times 0 = 0 . 0 0 0 2 1 1 5

$$  

so that the new daily volatility is ${ \sqrt { 0 . 0 0 0 2 1 1 5 } } = 0 . 0 1 4 5 4$ or $1 . 4 5 4 \%$ per day. Using GARCH (1,1), the variance is updated to  

$$

0 . 0 0 0 0 0 2 + 0 . 9 4 \times 0 . 0 1 5 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 0 4 \times 0 = 0 . 0 0 0 2 1 3 5

$$  

so that the new daily volatility is ${ \sqrt { 0 . 0 0 0 2 1 3 5 } } = 0 . 0 1 4 6 1$ or $1 . 4 6 1 \%$ per day. The initial covariance is $0 . 8 \times 0 . 0 1 3 \times 0 . 0 1 5 = 0 . 0 0 0 1 5 6$ .  Using EWMA, the covariance is updated to $0 . 9 4 \times 0 . 0 0 0 1 5 6 + 0 . 0 6 \times 0 = 0 . 0 0 0 1 4 6 6 4$  

so that the new correlation is $0 . 0 0 0 1 4 6 6 4 / \left( 0 . 0 1 4 5 4 \times 0 . 0 1 2 7 1 \right) = 0 . 7 9 3 .$ . Using GARCH (1,1), the covariance is updated to $0 . 0 0 0 0 0 2 + 0 . 9 4 \times 0 . 0 0 0 1 5 6 + 0 . 0 4 \times 0 = 0 . 0 0 0 1 4 8 6 4$  

so that the new correlation is $0 . 0 0 0 1 4 8 6 4 / \left( 0 . 0 1 4 6 1 \times 0 . 0 1 2 7 5 \right) = 0 . 7 9 7 7$ .  

For a given $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , the $\omega$ parameter defines the long run average value of a variance or a covariance. There is no reason why we should expect the long run average daily variance for gold and silver should be the same. There is also no reason why we should expect the long run average covariance between gold and silver to be the same as the long run average variance of gold or the long run average variance of silver. In practice, therefore, we are likely to want to allow $\omega$ in a GARCH(1,1) model to vary from market variable to market variable. (Some instructors may want to use this problem as a lead in to multivariate GARCH models.)

From equation (24.2), the average hazard rate over the three years is $0 . 0 0 5 0 / \left( 1 - 0 . 3 \right) = 0 . 0 0 7 1$ or $0 . 7 1 \%$ per year.  

# 24.2  

From equation (24.2), the average hazard rate over the five years is $0 . 0 0 6 0 / \left( 1 - 0 . 3 \right) = 0 . 0 0 8 6$ or $0 . 8 6 \%$ per year. Using the results in the previous question, the hazard rate is $0 . 7 1 \%$ per year for the first three years and  

$$

\frac { 0 . 0 0 8 6 \times 5 - 0 . 0 0 7 1 \times 3 } { 2 } = 0 . 0 1 0 7

$$  

or $1 . 0 7 \%$ per year in years 4 and 5.  

# 24.3  

Real-world probabilities of default should be used for calculating credit value at risk. Riskneutral probabilities of default should be used for adjusting the price of a derivative for default.  

# 24.4  

The recovery rate for a bond is the value of the bond shortly after the issuer defaults as a percent of its face value.  

# 24.5  

The hazard rate, $h ( t )$ at time $t$ is defined so that $h ( t ) \Delta t$ is the probability of default between times $t$ and $t + \Delta t$ conditional on no default prior to time $t$ . The unconditional default probability density $q ( t )$ is defined so that $q ( t ) \Delta t$ is the probability of default between times $t$ and $t + \Delta t$ as seen at time zero.  

24.6 The seven-year historical hazard rate for AAA-rated companies is  

$$
- [ \ln ( 1 - 0 . 0 0 5 1 ) ] / 7 = 0 . 0 0 0 7 3
$$  

or $0 . 0 7 3 \%$ per year. Similarly, the historical hazard rates for AA, A, BBB, BB, B, and CCC/C companies are $0 . 0 7 2 \%$ , $0 . 1 1 3 \%$ , $0 . 3 3 7 \%$ , $1 . 3 4 9 \%$ , $3 . 2 5 2 \%$ , $9 . 4 1 3 \%$ , respectively. The spread to compensate for default are $60 \%$ of these. In basis points, the spreads for AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, and CCC/C companies are 4.4, 4.3, 6.8, 20.2, 80.9, 195.1, and 564.8.  

# 24.7  

Suppose company A goes bankrupt when it has a number of outstanding contracts with company B. Netting means that the contracts with a positive value to A are netted against those with a negative value in order to determine how much, if anything, company A owes  

company B. Company A is not allowed to “cherry pick” by keeping the positive-value contracts and defaulting on the negative-value contracts.   
The new transaction will increase the bank’s exposure to the counterparty if the contract tends to have a positive value whenever the existing contract has a positive value and a negative value whenever the existing contract has a negative value. However, if the new transaction tends to offset the existing transaction, it is likely to have the incremental effect of reducing credit risk.  

# 24.8  

When a bank is experiencing financial difficulties, its credit spread is likely to increase. This increases $q _ { i } { } ^ { * }$ and DVA increases. This is a benefit to the bank: the fact that it is more likely to default means that its derivatives are worth less.  

# 24.9  

(a) In the Gaussian copula model for time to default, a credit loss is recognized only when a default occurs. In CreditMetrics, it is recognized when there is a credit downgrade as well as when there is a default.   
(b) In the Gaussian copula model of time to default, the default correlation arises because the value of the factor $M$ . This defines the default environment or average default rate in the economy. In CreditMetrics, a copula model is applied to credit ratings migration and this determines the joint probability of particular changes in the credit ratings of two companies.  

# 24.10  

When the claim amount is the no-default value, the loss for a corporate bond arising from a default at time $t$ is  

$$

\nu ( t ) ( 1 - \hat { R } ) B ^ { * }

$$  

where $\nu ( t )$ is the discount factor for time $t$ and $\boldsymbol { B } ^ { * }$ is the no-default value of the bond at time $t$ . Suppose that the zero-coupon bonds comprising the corporate bond have no-default values at time $t$ of $Z _ { 1 } , Z _ { 2 } , . . . , Z _ { n }$ , respectively. The loss from the $i$ th zero-coupon bond arising from a default at time $t$ is  

$$

\nu ( t ) ( 1 - \hat { R } ) Z _ { i }

$$  

The total loss from all the zero-coupon bonds is  

$$

\nu ( t ) ( 1 - \hat { R } ) \sum _ { i } ^ { n } Z _ { i } = \nu ( t ) ( 1 - \hat { R } ) B ^ { * }

$$  

This shows that the loss arising from a default at time $t$ is the same for the corporate bond as for the portfolio of its constituent zero-coupon bonds. It follows that the value of the corporate bond is the same as the value of its constituent zero-coupon bonds. When the claim amount is the face value plus accrued interest, the loss for a corporate bond arising from a default at time $t$ is  

$$

\nu ( t ) B ^ { * } - \nu ( t ) \hat { R } [ L + a ( t ) ]

$$  

where $L$ is the face value and $a ( t )$ is the accrued interest at time $t$ . In general, this is not the  

same as the loss from the sum of the losses on the constituent zero-coupon bonds.  

# 24.11  

Define $\boldsymbol { \mathcal { Q } }$ as the risk-free rate. The calculations are as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Time (vrs)</td><td>Def.

The bond pays a coupon of 2 every six months and has a continuously compounded yield of $5 \%$ per year. Its market price is 96.19. The risk-free value of the bond is obtained by discounting the promised cash flows at $3 \%$ . It is 103.66. The total loss from defaults should therefore be equated to $1 0 3 . 6 6 - 9 6 . 1 9 = 7 . 4 6$ . The value of $\boldsymbol { \mathcal { Q } }$ implied by the bond price is therefore given by $2 7 2 . 6 9 Q = 7 . 4 6$ . or $Q = 0 . 0 2 7 4$ . The implied probability of default is $2 . 7 4 \%$ per year.  

24.12 The table for the first bond is as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Time (yrs)</td><td>Def. Prob.</td><td>Recovery Amount ($)</td><td>Risk-free Value ($)</td><td>Loss Given Default ($)</td><td>Discount Factor</td><td>PV of Expected Loss ($)</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>Q</td><td>40</td><td>103.01</td><td>63.01</td><td>0.9827</td><td>61.92Q</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>Q</td><td>40</td><td>102.61</td><td>62.61</td><td>0.9489</td><td>59.41Q</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>Q</td><td>40</td><td>102.20</td><td>62.20</td><td>0.9162</td><td>56.98Q1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>178.31Q1</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The market price of the bond is 98.35 and the risk-free value is 101.23. It follows that $Q _ { \mathrm { { l } } }$ is given by  

$$

1 7 8 . 3 1 \mathcal { Q } _ { 1 } = 1 0 1 . 2 3 - 9 8 . 3 5

$$  

so that $\mathcal { Q } _ { \mathrm { 1 } } = 0 . 0 1 6 1$ .  

The table for the second bond is as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Time (yrs)</td><td>Def. Prob.</td><td>Recovery Amount ($)</td><td>Risk-free Value ($)</td><td>Loss Given Default ($)</td><td>Discount Factor</td><td>PV of Expected Loss ($)</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td></td><td>40</td><td>103.77</td><td>63.77</td><td>0.9827</td><td>62.67Q</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>Q</td><td>40</td><td>103.40</td><td>63.40</td><td>0.9489</td><td>60.16Q</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>Q</td><td>40</td><td>103.01</td><td>63.01</td><td>0.9162</td><td>57.73Q</td></tr><tr><td>3.5</td><td>Q2</td><td>40</td><td>102.61</td><td>62.61</td><td>0.8847</td><td>55.39Q2</td></tr><tr><td>4.5</td><td>Q2</td><td>40</td><td>102.20</td><td>62.20</td><td>0.8543</td><td>53.13Q2</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>180.56Q +108.53Q2</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The market price of the bond is 96.24 and the risk-free value is 101.97. It follows that  

$$

1 8 0 . 5 6 \mathcal { Q } _ { 1 } + 1 0 8 . 5 3 \mathcal { Q } _ { 2 } = 1 0 1 . 9 7 - 9 6 . 2 4

$$  

From which we get $Q _ { 2 } = 0 . 0 2 6 0$ .  The bond prices therefore imply a probability of default of $1 . 6 1 \%$ per year for the first three years and $2 . 6 0 \%$ for the next two years.  

# 24.13  

The statements in (a) and (b) are true. The statement in (c) is not. Suppose that $\nu _ { \mathrm { { X } } }$ and $\nu _ { \mathrm { Y } }$ are the exposures to $\mathrm { \Delta X }$ and Y. The expected value of $\nu _ { \mathrm { { { X } } } } + \nu _ { \mathrm { { { Y } } } }$ is the expected value of $\nu _ { \mathrm { { X } } }$ plus the expected value of $\nu _ { \mathrm { Y } }$ . The same is not true of $9 5 \%$ confidence limits.  

# 24.14  

Assume that defaults happen only at the end of the life of the forward contract. In a defaultfree world, the forward contract is the combination of a long European call and a short European put where the strike price of the options equals the delivery price and the maturity of the options equals the maturity of the forward contract. If the no-default value of the contract is positive at maturity, the call has a positive value and the put is worth zero. The impact of defaults on the forward contract is the same as that on the call. If the no-default value of the contract is negative at maturity, the call has a zero value and the put has a positive value. In this case, defaults have no effect. Again, the impact of defaults on the forward contract is the same as that on the call. It follows that the contract has a value equal to a long position in a call that is subject to default risk and short position in a default-free put.  

24.15 Suppose that the forward contract provides a payoff at time $T$ . With our usual notation, the value of a long forward contract is $S _ { T } - K e ^ { - r T }$ . The credit exposure on a long forward contract is therefore $\operatorname* { m a x } ( S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } - K e ^ { - r T } , 0 )$ ; that is, it is a call on the asset price with strike price $K e ^ { - r T }$ . Similarly, the credit exposure on a short forward contract is $\operatorname* { m a x } ( K e ^ { - r T } - S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } , 0 )$ ; that is, it is a put on the asset price with strike price $K e ^ { - r T }$ . The total credit exposure is, therefore, a straddle with strike price $K e ^ { - r T }$ .  

# 24.16  

The credit risk on a matched pair of interest rate swaps is $\mid B _ { \mathrm { f i x e d } } - B _ { \mathrm { f l o a t i n g } } \mid$ . As maturity is approached, all bond prices tend to par and this tends to zero. The credit risk on a matched pair of currency swaps is $\lvert S B _ { \mathrm { f o r e i g n } } - B _ { \mathrm { f i x e d } } \rvert$ where $S$ is the exchange rate. The expected value of this tends to increase as the swap maturity is approached because of the uncertainty in $S$ .  

# 24.17  

As time passes, there is a tendency for the currency which has the lower interest rate to strengthen. This means that a swap where we are receiving this currency will tend to move in the money (i.e., have a positive value). Similarly, a swap where we are paying the currency will tend to move out of the money (i.e., have a negative value). From this, it follows that our expected exposure on the swap where we are receiving the low-interest currency is much greater than our expected exposure on the swap where we are receiving the high-interest currency. We should therefore look for counterparties with a low credit risk on the side of the swap where we are receiving the low-interest currency. On the other side of the swap, we are far less concerned about the creditworthiness of the counterparty.  

# 24.18  

No, put–call parity does not hold when there is default risk. Suppose $c ^ { * }$ and $p ^ { * }$ are the nodefault prices of a European call and put with strike price $K$ and maturity $T$ on a nondividend-paying stock whose price is $S$ , and that $c$ and $p$ are the corresponding values when there is default risk. The text shows that when we make the independence assumption (that is, we assume that the variables determining the no-default value of the option are independent of the variables determining default probabilities and recovery rates),  

$c = c ^ { * } e ^ { - [ y ( T ) - y ^ { * } ( T ) ] T }$ and $p = p ^ { * } e ^ { - [ y ( T ) - y ^ { * } ( T ) ] T }$ . The relationship  

$$

c ^ { * } + K e ^ { - y ^ { * } ( T ) T } = p ^ { * } + S

$$  

which holds in a no-default world therefore becomes  

$$

c + K e ^ { - y ( T ) T } = p + S e ^ { - [ y ( T ) - y ^ { * } ( T ) ] T }

$$  

when there is default risk. This is not the same as regular put–call parity. What is more, the relationship depends on the independence assumption and cannot be deduced from the same sort of simple no-arbitrage arguments that we used in Chapter 11 for the put–call parity relationship in a no-default world.  

# 24.19  

We can assume that the principal is paid and received at the end of the life of the swap without changing the swap’s value. Because the coupons on the bond are paid regardless of whether the bond defaults, the value of what one side pays is the default-free value of the bond. This is the current market value of the bond plus the present value of defaults.  The value of what the other side pays is the value of a floating rate bond plus the present value of the spreads. Hence, the current market value of the bond plus present value of cost of defaults equals value of floating rate bond plus present value of the spreads. We are told that the bond is worth par. The floating rate bond is also worth par. It follows that the present value of the cost of defaults equals the present value of the spread.  (Note that if the bond is not worth par, the asset swap is structured so that one side initially pays the difference between its value and par to the other side. This preserves our result that the present value of the spreads equals the present value of the cost of defaults.)  

# 24.20  

The value of the debt in Merton’s model is $V _ { 0 } - E _ { 0 }$ or  

$$

D e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } ) - V _ { 0 } N ( d _ { 1 } ) + V _ { 0 } = D e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } ) + V _ { 0 } N ( - d _ { 1 } )

$$  

If the credit spread is $s$ , this should equal $D e ^ { - ( r + s ) T }$ so that  

$$

D e ^ { - ( r + s ) T } = D e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } ) + V _ { 0 } N ( - d _ { 1 } )

$$  

Substituting $D e ^ { - r T } = L V _ { 0 }$  

$$

L V _ { 0 } e ^ { - s T } = L V _ { 0 } N ( d _ { 2 } ) + V _ { 0 } N ( - d _ { 1 } )

$$  

or  

$$

L e ^ { - s T } = L N ( d _ { 2 } ) + N ( - d _ { 1 } )

$$  

so that  

$$

s = - \ln [ N ( d _ { 2 } ) + N ( - d _ { 1 } ) / L ] / T

$$  

# 24.21  

When the default risk of the seller of the option is taken into account, the option value is the Black–Scholes price multiplied by $e ^ { - 0 . 0 1 \times 3 } = 0 . 9 7 0 4$ . Black–Scholes overprices the option by about $3 \%$ .  

# 24.22  

Right way risk describes the situation when a default by the counterparty is most likely to occur when the contract has a positive value to the counterparty. An example of right way risk would be when a counterparty’s future depends on the price of a commodity and it enters into a contract to partially hedging that exposure.  

Wrong way risk describes the situation when a default by the counterparty is most likely to occur when the contract has a negative value to the counterparty. An example of right way risk would be when a counterparty is a speculator and the contract has the same exposure as the rest of the counterparty’s portfolio.

The market price of the bond is 105.51. The risk-free price is 108.40. The expected cost of defaults is therefore 2.89.  We need to find the hazard rate $\lambda$ that leads to the expected cost of defaults being 2.89. We need to make an assumption about how the probability of default  at a time is calculated from the hazard rate.  The following table shows the calculations:

It is $1 . 7 0 \%$ .

Real world default probabilities are the true probabilities of defaults. They can be estimated from historical data. Risk-neutral default probabilities are the probabilities of defaults in a world where all market participants are risk neutral. They can be estimated from bond prices. Risk-neutral default probabilities are higher. This means that returns in the risk-neutral world are lower. From Table 24.4, the probability of a company moving from A to BBB or lower in one year is $5 . 7 4 \%$ . An estimate of the value of the derivative is therefore $0 . 0 5 7 4 { \times } \$ 100 { \times } \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 1 } = \ S 5 . 4 6$ . The approximation in this is that we are using the real-world probability of a downgrade. To value the derivative correctly, we should use the risk-neutral probability of a downgrade. Since the risk-neutral probability of a default is higher than the real-world probability, it seems likely that the same is true of a downgrade. This means that $\$ 5.46$ is likely to be too low as an estimate of the value of the derivative.  

# 24.26  

In this case, $E _ { 0 } = 4$ , $\sigma _ { E } = 0 . 6 0$ , $D = 1 5$ , $r = 0 . 0 6$ . Setting up the data in Excel, we can solve equations (24.3) and (24.4) by using the approach in footnote 10. The solution to the  

equations proves to be $V _ { 0 } = 1 7 . 0 8 4$ and $\sigma _ { { } _ { V } } = 0 . 1 5 7 6$ . The probability of default is $N ( - d _ { 2 } )$ or $1 5 . 6 1 \%$ . The market value of the debt is $1 7 . 0 8 4 - 4 = 1 3 . 0 8 4$ . The present value of the promised payment on the debt is $1 5 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 \times 2 } = 1 3 . 3 0 4$ . The expected loss on the debt is, therefore, (13304 13084) 13304 or $1 . 6 5 \%$ of its no-default value. The expected recovery rate in the event of default is therefore $( 1 5 . 6 1 - 1 . 6 5 ) / 1 5 . 6 1$ or about $89 \%$ . The reason the recovery rate is so high is as follows. There is a default if the value of the assets moves from 17.08 to below 15. A value for the assets significantly below 15 is unlikely. Conditional on a default, the expected value of the assets is, therefore, not a huge amount below 15. In practice, it is likely that companies manage to delay defaults until asset values are well below the face value of the debt.  

# 24.27  

From equation (24.10), the $9 9 . 5 \%$ worst case probability of default is  

$$

N \left( \frac { N ^ { - 1 } ( 0 . 0 1 ) + \sqrt { 0 . 2 } N ^ { - 1 } ( 0 . 9 9 5 ) } { \sqrt { 0 . 8 } } \right) = 0 . 0 9 4 6

$$  

This gives the $9 9 . 5 \%$ credit VaR as $1 0 \times ( 1 - 0 . 4 ) \times 0 . 0 9 4 6 = 0 . 5 6 8$ millions of dollars or $\$ 568,000$ .  

# 24.28 (Excel file)  

The spreadsheet shows the answer is 5.73.  

# 24.29 (Excel file)  

In this case, we look at the exposure from the point of view of the counterparty. The exposure at time $t$ is  

$$

e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } \operatorname* { m a x } [ K - F _ { t } , 0 ]

$$  

The expected exposure at time $t$ is therefore  

$$

e ^ { - r ( T - t ) } \bigl [ K N ( - d _ { 2 } ( t ) ) - F _ { 0 } N ( - d _ { 1 } ( t ) ) \bigr ]

$$  

The spreadsheet shows that the DVA is 1.134.

Both provide insurance against a particular company defaulting during a period of time. In a credit default swap, the payoff is the notional principal amount multiplied by one minus the recovery rate. In a binary swap, the payoff is the notional principal.

A cash CDO is created by buying bonds and tranching out the risks. A synthetic CDO is created from a portfolio of short  CDSs (i.e., CDS that are selling protection).  

# 25.4  

Single tranche trading occurs when a tranche of a synthetic CDO is traded without the underlying portfolios of short CDSs being created. The underlying portfolio is simply used as a reference point to determine cash flows on the tranche.

In a first-to-default basket CDS there are a number of reference entities. When the first one defaults, there is a payoff (calculated in the usual way for a CDS) and basket CDS terminates. The value of a first-to-default basket CDS decreases as the correlation between the reference entities in the basket increases. This is because the probability of a default is high when the correlation is zero and decreases as the correlation increases. In the limit when the correlation is one, there is in effect only one company and the probability of a default is quite low.  

# 25.6  

Risk-neutral default probabilities are backed out from credit default swaps or bond prices. Real-world default probabilities are calculated from historical data. Risk-neutral probabilities should be used for valuation (e.g., the valuations of CDSs). Real world probabilities should be used for scenario analysis.  

# 25.7  

Suppose a company wants to buy some assets. If a total return swap is used, a financial institution buys the assets and enters into a swap with the company where it pays the company the return on the assets and receives from the company LIBOR plus a spread. The financial institution has less risk than it would have if it lent the company money and used the assets as collateral. This is because, in the event of a default by the company, it owns the  

assets.  

25.8 The table corresponding to Tables 25.1, giving unconditional default probabilities, is as follows:   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Time (years)</td><td>Probability of surviving to year end</td><td>Default Probability during year</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.9704</td><td>0.0296</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0.9418</td><td>0.0287</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0.9139</td><td>0.0278</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>0.8869</td><td>0.0270</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>0.8607</td><td>0.0262</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The table corresponding to Table 25.2, giving the present value of the expected regular payments (payment rate is $s$ per year), is as follows:

The table corresponding to Table 25.3, giving the present value of the expected payoffs (notional principal $\mathsf { \Pi } = \$ 1$ ), is as follows:

The table corresponding to Table 25.4, giving the present value of accrual payments, is as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Time (yrs)</td><td>Probability of default</td><td>Expected Accrual Payment</td><td>Discount Factor</td><td>PV of Expected Accrual Payment</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>0.0296</td><td>0.0148s</td><td>0.9656</td><td>0.0143s</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>0.0287</td><td>0.0143s</td><td>0.9003</td><td>0.0129s</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>0.0278</td><td>0.0139s</td><td>0.8395</td><td>0.0117s</td></tr><tr><td>3.5</td><td>0.0270</td><td>0.0135s</td><td>0.7827</td><td>0.0106s</td></tr><tr><td>4.5</td><td>0.0262</td><td>0.0131s</td><td>0.7298</td><td>0.0096s</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.0590s</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The credit default swap spread $s$ is given by: $3 . 7 4 1 2 s \mathrm { + } 0 . 0 5 9 0 s = 0 . 0 8 2 6$  

It is 0.0217 or 217 basis points. This can be verified with DerivaGem.  

# 25.9  

If the credit default swap spread is 150 basis points, the value of the swap to the buyer of protection is:  

$$

0 . 0 8 2 6 - ( 3 . 7 4 1 2 + 0 . 0 5 9 0 ) \times 0 . 0 1 5 0 = 0 . 0 2 5 6

$$  

per dollar of notional principal.  

25.10 If the swap is a binary CDS, the present value of expected payoffs is calculated as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Time (years)</td><td>Probability of Default</td><td>Expected Payoff</td><td>Discount Factor</td><td>PV of expected Payoff</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>0.0296</td><td>0.0296</td><td>0.9656</td><td>0.0285</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>0.0287</td><td>0.0287</td><td>0.9003</td><td>0.0258</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>0.0278</td><td>0.0278</td><td>0.8395</td><td>0.0234</td></tr><tr><td>3.5</td><td>0.0270</td><td>0.0270</td><td>0.7827</td><td>0.0211</td></tr><tr><td>4.5</td><td>0.0262</td><td>0.0262</td><td>0.7298</td><td>0.0191</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.1180</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The credit default swap spread $s$ is given by: $3 . 7 4 1 2 s + 0 . 0 5 9 0 s = 0 . 1 1 8 0$  

It is 0.0310 or 310 basis points.  

# 25.11  

A five-year $n$ th to default credit default swap works in the same way as a regular credit default swap except that there is a basket of companies. The payoff occurs when the $n$ th default from the companies in the basket occurs. After the $n$ th default has occurred, the swap ceases to exist. When $n = 1$ (so that the swap is a “first to default”), an increase in the default correlation lowers the value of the swap. When the default correlation is zero, there are 100 independent events that can lead to a payoff. As the correlation increases, the probability of a payoff decreases. In the limit when the correlation is perfect, there is in effect only one company and therefore only one event that can lead to a payoff.  

When $n = 2 5$ (so that the swap is a 25th to default), an increase in the default correlation increases the value of the swap. When the default correlation is zero, there is virtually no chance that there will be 25 defaults and the value of the swap is very close to zero. As the correlation increases, the probability of multiple defaults increases. In the limit when the correlation is perfect, there is in effect only one company and the value of a 25th-to-default credit default swap is the same as the value of a first-to-default swap.  

# 25.12.  

The payoff is $L ( 1 - R )$ where $L$ is the notional principal and $R$ is the recovery rate.  

# 25.13.  

The payoff from a plain vanilla CDS is $1 - R$ times the payoff from a binary CDS with the same principal. The payoff always occurs at the same time on the two instruments. It follows that the regular payments on a new plain vanilla CDS must be $1 - R$ times the payments on a new binary CDS. Otherwise, there would be an arbitrage opportunity.  

# 25.14  

The $1 . 6 3 \%$ hazard rate can be calculated by setting up a worksheet in Excel and using Solver. To verify that $1 . 6 3 \%$ is correct we note that, with a hazard rate of $1 . 6 3 \%$ , the table is as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Time (years)</td><td>Probability of surviving to year end</td><td>Default Probability during year</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.9838</td><td>0.0162</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0.9679</td><td>0.0159</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0.9523</td><td>0.0156</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>0.9369</td><td>0.0154</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>0.9217</td><td>0.0151</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The present value of the regular payments becomes $4 . 1 1 6 2 s$ , the present value of the expected payoffs becomes 0.0416, and the present value of the expected accrual payments becomes $0 . 0 3 4 7 s$ .When $s = 0 . 0 1$ , the present value of the expected payments equals the present value of the expected payoffs.  

When the recovery rate is $20 \%$ , the implied hazard rate (calculated using Solver) is $1 . 2 2 \%$ per year. Note that $1 . 2 2 / 1 . 6 3 \$ is approximately equal to $( 1 - 0 . 4 ) / ( 1 - 0 . 2 )$ showing that the implied hazard is approximately proportional to $1 / \left( 1 - R \right)$ .  

In passing we note that if the CDS spread is used to imply an unconditional default probability (assumed to be the same each year) then this implied unconditional default probability is exactly proportional to $1 / \left( 1 - R \right)$ . When we use the CDS spread to imply a hazard rate (assumed to be the same each year) it is only approximately proportional to $1 / ( 1 - R )$ .  

# 25.15  

In the case of a total return swap, a company receives (pays) the increase (decrease) in the value of the bond. In the regular swap, this does not happen.  

# 25.16  

When a company enters into a long (short) forward contract, it is obligated to buy (sell) the protection given by a specified credit default swap with a specified spread at a specified future time. When a company buys a call (put) option contract, it has the option to buy (sell) the protection given by a specified credit default swap with a specified spread at a specified future time. Both contracts are normally structured so that they cease to exist if a default occurs during the life of the contract.  

# 25.17  

A credit default swap insures a corporate bond issued by the reference entity against default. Its approximate effect is to convert the corporate bond into a risk-free bond. The buyer of a credit default swap has therefore chosen to exchange a corporate bond for a risk-free bond. This means that the buyer is long a risk-free bond and short a similar corporate bond.  

# 25.18  

Payoffs from credit default swaps depend on whether a particular company defaults. Arguably, some market participants have more information about this than other market participants. (See Business Snapshot 25.2.)  

# 25.19  

Real world default probabilities are less than risk-neutral default probabilities. It follows that the use of real world (historical) default probabilities will tend to understate the value of a CDS.  

# 25.20  

In an asset swap, the bond’s promised payments are swapped for floating reference rate plus a spread. In a total return swap, the bond’s actual payments are swapped for floating reference rate plus a spread.  

# 25.21  

Using equation (25.5), the probability of default conditional on a factor value of $F$ is  

$$

N { \left( \frac { N ^ { - 1 } ( 0 . 0 3 ) - { \sqrt { 0 . 2 } } F } { \sqrt { 1 - 0 . 2 } } \right) }

$$  

For $F$ equal to $- 2 , - 1 , 0 , 1$ , and 2 the probabilities of default are 0.135, 0.054, 0.018, 0.005, and 0.001 respectively. To six decimal places, the probability of more than 10 defaults for these values of $F$ can be calculated using the BINOMDIST function in Excel. They are 0.959284, 0.079851, 0.000016, 0, and 0, respectively.  

# 25.22  

Compound correlation for a tranche is the correlation which when substituted into the onefactor Gaussian copula model produces the market quote for the tranche. Base correlation is the correlation which is consistent with the one-factor Gaussian copula and market quotes for the 0 to $X \%$ tranche where $X \%$ is a detachment point. It ensures that the expected loss on the 0 to $X \%$ tranche equals the sum of the expected losses on the underlying traded tranches.  

# 25.23  

In this case, $a _ { \scriptscriptstyle L } = 0 . 0 9$ and $a _ { { \scriptscriptstyle H } } = 0 . 1 2$ . Proceeding similarly in Example 25.2, the tranche spread is calculated as 30 basis points.  

# 25.24  

The table corresponding to Table 25.2, giving the present value of the expected regular payments (payment rate is $s$ per year), is as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Time (yrs)</td><td>Probability of survival</td><td>Expected Payment</td><td>Discount Factor</td><td>PV of Expected Payment</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>0.990</td><td>0.4950s</td><td>0.9704</td><td>0.4804s</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>0.980</td><td>0.4900s</td><td>0.9418</td><td>0.4615s</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>0.965</td><td>0.4825s</td><td>0.9139</td><td>0.4410s</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>0.950</td><td>0.4750s</td><td>0.8869</td><td>0.4213s</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1.8041s</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The table corresponding to Table 25.3, giving the present value of the expected payoffs (notional principal $\scriptstyle = \$ 1$ ), is as follows:

The table corresponding to Table 25.4, giving the present value of accrual payments, is as follows:

The credit default swap spread $s$ is given by:  

$$

1 . 8 0 4 s + 0 . 0 1 1 7 s = 0 . 0 3 7 5

$$  

It is 0.0206 or 206 basis points. For a binary credit default swap, we set the recovery rate equal to zero in the second table to get the present value of expected payoffs equal to 0.0468 so that  

$$

1 . 8 0 4 s + 0 . 0 1 1 7 s = 0 . 0 4 6 8

$$  

and the spread is 0.0258 or 258 basis points.  

# 25.25  

The spread for a binary credit default swap is equal to the spread for a regular credit default swap divided by $1 - R$ where $R$ is the recovery rate. This means that $1 - R$ equals 0.75 so that the recovery rate is $2 5 \%$ . To find $\lambda$ , we search for the conditional annual default rate that leads to the present value of payments being equal to the present value of payoffs. The answer is $\lambda = 0 . 0 1 5 6$ . The present value of payoffs (per dollar of principal) is then 0.0499. The present value of regular payments is 4.1245. The present value of accrual payments is 0.0332.  

# 25.26  

As the correlation increases, the yield on the equity tranche decreases and the yield on the senior tranches increases. To understand this, consider what happens as the correlation increases from zero to one. Initially, the equity tranche is much more risky than the senior tranche. But as the correlation approaches one, the companies become essentially the same. We are then in the position where either all companies default or no companies default and the tranches have similar risk.  

# 25.27  

When the credit default swap spread is 150 basis points, an arbitrageur can earn more than the risk-free rate by buying the corporate bond and buying protection. If the arbitrageur can finance trades at the risk-free rate (by shorting the riskless bond), it is possible to lock in an almost certain profit of 100 basis points. When the credit spread is 300 basis points, the arbitrageur can short the corporate bond, sell protection and buy a risk free bond. This will lock in an almost certain profit of 50 basis points. The arbitrage is not perfect for a number of reasons:  

(a) It assumes that both the corporate bond and the riskless bond are par yield bonds and that interest rates are constant. In practice, the riskless bond may be worth more or less than par at the time of a default so that a credit default swap under protects or overprotects the bond holder relative to the position with a riskless bond.   
(b) There is uncertainty created by the cheapest-to-delivery bond option.   
(c) To be a perfect hedge, the credit default swap would have to give the buyer of protection the right to sell the bond for face value plus accrued interest, not just face value.  

The arbitrage opportunities assume that market participants can short corporate bonds and borrow at the risk-free rate. The definition of the credit event in the ISDA agreement is also occasionally a problem. It can occasionally happen that there is a "credit event" but promised payments on the bond are made.  

# 25.28  

(a) In this case, the answer to Example 25.3 gets modified as follows. When $F = - 1 . 0 1 0 4 \$ , the cumulative probabilities of one or more defaults in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years are 0.3075, 0.5397, 0.6959, 0.7994, and 0.8676. The conditional probability that the first default occurs in years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are 0.3075, 0.2322, 0.1563, 0.1035, and 0.0682, respectively. The present values of payoffs, regular payments, and accrual payments conditional on $F = - 1 . 0 1 0 4 \$ are 0.4767, $1 . 6 0 4 4 s$ , and $0 . 3 9 7 3 s$ . Similar calculations are carried out for the other factor values. The unconditional expected present values of payoffs, regular payments, and accrual payments are 0.2602, $2 . 9 3 2 5 s$ , and $0 . 2 1 6 8 s$ . The breakeven spread is therefore  

$$

0 . 2 6 0 2 / ( 2 . 9 3 2 5 + 0 . 2 1 6 8 ) = 0 . 0 8 2 6

$$  

or 826 basis points.  

(b) In this case, the answer to Example 25.3 gets modified as follows. When $F = - 1 . 0 1 0 4 \$ , the cumulative probabilities of two or more defaults in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years are 0.0483, 0.1683, 0.3115, 0.4498, and 0.5709. The conditional probability that the second default occurs in years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are 0.0483, 0.1200, 0.1432, 0.1383, and 0.1211, respectively. The present values of payoffs, regular payments, and accrual payments conditional on $F = - 1 . 0 1 0 4 \$ are 0.2986, 3.0351s, and 0.2488s. Similar calculations are carried out for the other factor values. The unconditional expected present values of payoffs, regular payments, and accrual payments are 0.1264, $3 . 7 4 2 8 s$ , and $0 . 1 0 5 3 s$ . The breakeven spread is therefore  

$$

0 . 1 2 6 4 / ( 3 . 7 4 2 8 + 0 . 1 0 5 3 ) = 0 . 0 3 2 8

$$  

or 328 basis points.  

# 25.29  

In this case, $a _ { \scriptscriptstyle L } = 0 . 0 6$ and $a _ { H } = 0 . 0 9$ . Proceeding similarly in Example 25.2, the tranche spread is calculated as 98 basis points assuming a tranche correlation of 0.15.  

# 25.30  (Excel file)  

The hazard rate consistent with the data is $1 . 2 8 \%$ . The compound (tranche) correlations are 0.4017, 0.8425, 0.1136, 0.2198, and 0.3342. The base correlations are 0.4017, 0.5214, 0.5825, 0.6046, and 0.7313. Note that in January 2009 spreads were so high that correlations could not be implied and many dealers had to change their models.  

# CHAPTER 26 Exotic Options  

# Practice Questions  

# 26.1  

A forward start option is an option that is paid for now but will start at some time in the future. The strike price is usually equal to the price of the asset at the time the option starts. A chooser option is an option where, at some time in the future, the holder chooses whether the option is a call or a put.  

# 26.2  

A floating lookback call provides a payoff of $S _ { T } - S _ { \mathrm { m i n } }$ . A floating lookback put provides a payoff of $S _ { \mathrm { m a x } } - S _ { T }$ . A combination of a floating lookback call and a floating lookback put therefore provides a payoff of Smax  Smin .  

# 26.3  

No, it is never optimal to choose early. The resulting cash flows are the same regardless of when the choice is made. There is no point in the holder making a commitment earlier than necessary. This argument applies when the holder chooses between two American options providing the options cannot be exercised before the 2-year point. If the early exercise period starts as soon as the choice is made, the argument does not hold. For example, if the stock price fell to almost nothing in the first six months, the holder would choose a put option at this time and exercise it immediately.  

# 26.4  

The payoffs from $c _ { 1 } , c _ { 2 } , c _ { 3 } , p _ { 1 } , p _ { 2 } , p _ { 3 }$ are, respectively, as follows: $\begin{array} { r l } & { \mathrm { m a x } ( \overline { { S } } - K , 0 ) } \\ & { \mathrm { m a x } ( S _ { T } - \overline { { S } } , 0 ) } \\ & { \mathrm { m a x } ( S _ { T } - K , 0 ) } \\ & { \mathrm { m a x } ( K - \overline { { S } } , 0 ) } \\ & { \mathrm { m a x } ( \overline { { S } } - S _ { T } , 0 ) } \\ & { \mathrm { m a x } ( K - S _ { T } , 0 ) } \end{array}$  

The payoff from $c _ { 1 } - p _ { 1 }$ is always ${ \overline { { S } } } - K$ ; The payoff from $c _ { 2 } - p _ { 2 }$ is always $S _ { T } - \overline { { S } }$ ; The payoff from $c _ { 3 } - p _ { 3 }$ is always $S _ { T } - K$ ; It follows that  

$$

c _ { 1 } - p _ { 1 } + c _ { 2 } - p _ { 2 } = c _ { 3 } - p _ { 3 }

$$  

or  

$$

c _ { 1 } + c _ { 2 } - c _ { 3 } = p _ { 1 } + p _ { 2 } - p _ { 3 }

$$  

26.5 Substituting for $c$ , put-call parity gives  

$$

\mathrm { m a x } ( c , p ) = \mathrm { m a x } \Big [ p , p + S _ { 1 } e ^ { - q ( T _ { 2 } - T _ { 1 } ) } - K e ^ { - r ( T _ { 2 } - T _ { 1 } ) } \Big ]

$$  

$$

= p + \operatorname* { m a x } \Bigl [ 0 , S _ { 1 } e ^ { - q ( T _ { 2 } - T _ { 1 } ) } - K e ^ { - r ( T _ { 2 } - T _ { 1 } ) } \Bigr ]

$$  

This shows that the chooser option can be decomposed into:  

1. A put option with strike price $\mathrm { K }$ and maturity $T _ { _ 2 }$ ; and   
2. $e ^ { - q ( T _ { 2 } - T _ { 1 } ) }$ call options with strike price $K e ^ { - ( r - q ) ( T _ { 2 } - T _ { 1 } ) }$ and maturity $T _ { 1 }$ .  

# 26.6  

Consider the formula for $c _ { \mathrm { d o } }$ when $H \geq K$  

$$

c _ { \mathrm { d o } } = S _ { 0 } N ( x _ { 1 } ) e ^ { - q T } - K e ^ { - r T } N ( x _ { 1 } - \sigma \sqrt { T } ) - S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } ( H / S _ { 0 } ) ^ { 2 \lambda } N ( y _ { 1 } )

$$  

$$
+ K e ^ { - r T } ( H / S _ { 0 } ) ^ { 2 \lambda - 2 } N ( y _ { 1 } - \sigma \sqrt { T } )
$$  

Substituting $H = K$ and noting that  

$$

\lambda { = } \frac { r - q + \sigma ^ { 2 } \ d s / 2 } { \sigma ^ { 2 } }

$$  

we obtain $x _ { 1 } = d _ { 1 }$ so that  

$$

c _ { \mathrm { d o } } = c - S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } ( H / S _ { 0 } ) ^ { 2 \lambda } N ( y _ { 1 } ) + K e ^ { - r T } ( H / S _ { 0 } ) ^ { 2 \lambda - 2 } N ( y _ { 1 } - \sigma \sqrt { T } )

$$  

The formula for $c _ { \mathrm { d i } }$ when $H \leq K$ is  

$$

c _ { \mathrm { d i } } = S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } ( H / S _ { 0 } ) ^ { 2 \lambda } N ( y ) - K e ^ { - r T } ( H / S _ { 0 } ) ^ { 2 \lambda - 2 } N ( y - \sigma \sqrt { T } )

$$  

Since cdo  c cdi  

$$

c _ { \mathrm { d o } } = c - S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } ( H / S _ { 0 } ) ^ { 2 \lambda } N ( y ) + K e ^ { - r T } ( H / S _ { 0 } ) ^ { 2 \lambda - 2 } N ( y - \sigma \sqrt { T } )

$$  

From the formulas in the text $y _ { 1 } = y$ when $H = K$ . The two expression for $c _ { \mathrm { d o } }$ are therefore equivalent when $H = K$  

26.7 The option is in the money only when the asset price is less than the strike price. However, in these circumstances the barrier has been hit and the option has ceased to exist.  

# 26.8  

The argument is similar to that given in Chapter 11 for a regular option on a non-dividendpaying stock. Consider a portfolio consisting of the option and cash equal to the present value of the terminal strike price. The initial cash position is  

$$

K e ^ { g T - r T }

$$  

By time $\tau$ ( $0 \leq \tau \leq T )$ , the cash grows to  

$$

K e ^ { - r ( T - \tau ) + g T } = K e ^ { g \tau } e ^ { - ( r - g ) ( T - \tau ) }

$$  

Since $r > g$ , this is less than $K e ^ { g \tau }$ and therefore is less than the amount required to exercise the option. It follows that, if the option is exercised early, the terminal value of the portfolio is less than $S _ { T }$ . At time $T$ the cash balance is $K e ^ { g T }$ . This is exactly what is required to exercise the option. If the early exercise decision is delayed until time $T$ , the terminal value of the portfolio is therefore  

$$

\operatorname* { m a x } [ S _ { T } , K e ^ { g T } ]

$$  

This is at least as great as $S _ { T }$ . It follows that early exercise cannot be optimal.  

26.9 When the strike price of an option on a non-dividend-paying stock is defined as $10 \%$ greater that the stock price, the value of the option is proportional to the stock price. The same argument as that given in the text for forward start options shows that if $t _ { 1 }$ is the time when the option starts and $t _ { 2 }$ is the time when it finishes, the option has the same value as an option starting today with a life of $t _ { 2 } - t _ { 1 }$ and a strike price of 1.1 times the current stock price.  

# 26.10  

Assume that we start calculating averages from time zero. The relationship between $A ( t + \Delta t )$ and $\mathbf { \nabla } _ { A \left( t \right) }$ is  

$$

\mathcal { A } ( t + \Delta t ) \times ( t + \Delta t ) = \mathcal { A } ( t ) \times t + S ( t ) \times \Delta t

$$  

where $S ( t )$ is the stock price at time $t$ and terms of higher order than $\Delta t$ are ignored. If we continue to ignore terms of higher order than $\Delta t$ , it follows that  

$$

A ( t + \Delta t ) = A ( t ) \Bigg [ 1 - \frac { \Delta t } { t } \Bigg ] + S ( t ) \frac { \Delta t } { t }

$$  

Taking limits as $\Delta t$ tends to zero  

$$

d A ( t ) = \frac { S ( t ) - A ( t ) } { t } d t

$$  

The process for $\mathbf { \nabla } _ { A \left( t \right) }$ has a stochastic drift and no $d z$ term. The process makes sense intuitively. Once some time has passed, the change in $S$ in the next small portion of time has only a second order effect on the average. If $S$ equals $A$ the average has no drift; if $S > A$ the average is drifting up; if $S < A$ the average is drifting down.  

# 26.11  

In an Asian option, the payoff becomes more certain as time passes and the delta always approaches zero as the maturity date is approached. This makes delta hedging easy. Barrier options cause problems for delta hedgers when the asset price is close to the barrier because delta is discontinuous.  

# 26.12  

The value of the option is given by the formula in the text  

$$

V _ { 0 } e ^ { - q _ { 2 } T } N ( d _ { 1 } ) - U _ { 0 } e ^ { - q _ { 1 } T } N ( d _ { 2 } )

$$  

where  

$$

d _ { 1 } = \frac { \ln ( V _ { 0 } / U _ { 0 } ) + ( q _ { 1 } - q _ { 2 } + \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) T } { \sigma \sqrt { T } }

$$  

and  

$$

\sigma = \sqrt { \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } - 2 \rho \sigma _ { 1 } \sigma _ { 2 } }

$$  

In this case, $V _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 1 { , } 5 2 0$ , $U _ { 0 } = 1 6 0 0$ , $q _ { 1 } = 0 , q _ { 2 } = 0 , T = 1$ , and  

$$

\sigma = \sqrt { 0 . 2 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 2 ^ { 2 } - 2 \times 0 . 7 \times 0 . 2 \times 0 . 2 } = 0 . 1 5 4 9

$$  

Because $\mathrm { d } _ { 1 } { = } { - } 0 . 2 5 3 6$ and $d _ { 2 } = - 0 . 4 0 8 6$ , the option price is  

$$

1 5 2 0 N ( - 0 . 2 5 3 6 ) - 1 6 0 0 N ( - 0 . 4 0 8 6 ) = 6 1 . 5 4

$$  

or $\$ 61.54$ .  

# 26.13  

No. If the future’s price is above the spot price during the life of the option, it is possible that the spot price will hit the barrier when the futures price does not.  

# 26.14  

(a) The put–call relationship is  

$$

c c + K _ { 1 } e ^ { - r T _ { 1 } } = p c + c

$$  

where $c c$ is the price of the call on the call, $p c$ is the price of the put on the call, $c$ is the price today of the call into which the options can be exercised at time $T _ { 1 }$ , and $K _ { \mathfrak { i } }$ is the exercise price for $c c$ and $p c$ . The proof is similar to that in Chapter 11 for the usual put–call parity relationship. Both sides of the equation represent the values of portfolios that will be worth $\operatorname* { m a x } ( c , K _ { 1 } )$ at time $T _ { 1 }$ . Because  

$$

M ( a , b ; \rho ) = N ( a ) - M ( a , - b ; - \rho ) = N ( b ) - M ( - a , b , ; - \rho )

$$  

and  

$$

N ( x ) = 1 - N ( - x )

$$  

we obtain  

$$

\begin{array} { r } { c c - p c = S e ^ { - q T _ { 2 } } N ( b _ { 1 } ) - K _ { 2 } e ^ { - r T _ { 2 } } N ( b _ { 2 } ) - K _ { 1 } e ^ { - r T _ { 1 } } } \end{array}

$$  

Since  

$$

c = S e ^ { - q T _ { 2 } } N ( b _ { 1 } ) - K _ { 2 } e ^ { - r T _ { 2 } } N ( b _ { 2 } )

$$  

put–call parity is consistent with the formulas.  

(b) The put–call relationship is  

$$

c p + { K _ { 1 } e ^ { - r T _ { 1 } } } = p p + p

$$  

where $c p$ is the price of the call on the put, $p p$ is the price of the put on the put, $p$ is the price today of the put into which the options can be exercised at time $T _ { 1 }$ , and $K _ { \mathfrak { i } }$ is the exercise price for $c p$ and $p p$ . The proof is similar to that in Chapter 11 for the usual put–call parity relationship. Both sides of the equation represent the values of portfolios that will be worth $\operatorname* { m a x } ( p , K _ { 1 } )$ at time $T _ { 1 }$ . Because  

$$

M ( a , b ; \rho ) = N ( a ) - M ( a , - b ; - \rho ) = N ( b ) - M ( - a , b ; - \rho )

$$  

and  

$$

N ( x ) = 1 - N ( - x )

$$  

it follows that  

$$

c p - p p = - S e ^ { - q T _ { 2 } } N ( - b _ { 1 } ) + K _ { 2 } e ^ { - r T _ { 2 } } N ( - b _ { 2 } ) - K _ { 1 } e ^ { - r T _ { 1 } }

$$  

Because  

$$

p = - S e ^ { - q T _ { 2 } } N ( - b _ { 1 } ) + K _ { 2 } e ^ { - r T _ { 2 } } N ( - b _ { 2 } )

$$  

put–call parity is consistent with the formulas.  

# 26.15  

As we increase the frequency, we observe a more extreme minimum which increases the value of a floating lookback call.  

# 26.16  

As we increase the frequency with which the asset price is observed, the asset price becomes more likely to hit the barrier and the value of a down-and-out call goes down. For a similar reason the value of a down-and-in call goes up. The adjustment mentioned in the text,  

suggested by Broadie, Glasserman, and Kou, moves the barrier further out as the asset price is observed less frequently. This increases the price of a down-and-out option and reduces the price of a down-and-in option.  

# 26.17  

If the barrier is reached, the down-and-out option is worth nothing while the down-and-in option has the same value as a regular option. If the barrier is not reached, the down-and-in option is worth nothing while the down-and-out option has the same value as a regular option. This is why a down-and-out call option plus a down-and-in call option is worth the same as a regular option. A similar argument cannot be used for American options.  

# 26.18  

This is a cash-or-nothing call. The value is $1 0 0 N ( d _ { 2 } ) e ^ { - 0 . 0 8 \times 0 . 5 }$ where  

$$

d _ { 2 } = { \frac { \ln ( 9 6 0 / 1 0 0 0 ) + ( 0 . 0 8 - 0 . 0 3 - 0 . 2 ^ { 2 } / 2 ) \times 0 . 5 } { 0 . 2 \times { \sqrt { 0 . 5 } } } } = - 0 . 1 8 2 6

$$  

Since $N ( d _ { 2 } ) = 0 . 4 2 7 6$ ,  the value of the derivative is $\$ 41.08$ .  

# 26.19  

This is a regular call with a strike price of $\$ 20$ that ceases to exist if the futures price hits $\$ 18$ . With the notation in the text $H = 1 8$ , $K = 2 0$ , $S = 1 9$ , $r = 0 . 0 5$ , $\sigma = 0 . 4$ , $\scriptstyle q = 0 . 0 5$ , $T = 0 . 2 5$ . From this $\lambda = 0 . 5$ and  

$$

y = \frac { \ln [ 1 8 ^ { 2 } / \left( 1 9 \times 2 0 \right) ] } { 0 . 4 \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } } + 0 . 5 \times 0 . 4 \sqrt { 0 . 2 5 } = - 0 . 6 9 7 1 4

$$  

The value of a down-and-out call plus a down-and-in call equals the value of a regular call. Substituting into the formula given when $H < K$ we get $c _ { \mathrm { d i } } = 0 . 4 6 3 8$ . The regular Black– Scholes–Merton formula gives $c = 1 . 0 9 0 2$ . Hence, $c _ { \mathrm { d o } } = 0 . 6 2 6 4$ . (These answers can be checked with DerivaGem.)  

# 26.20  

DerivaGem shows that the value is 53.38. Note that the Minimum to date and Maximum to date should be set equal to the current value of the index for a new deal. (See material on DerivaGem at the end of the book.)  

# 26.21  

We can use the analytic approximation given in the text.  

$$

M _ { 1 } = \frac { ( e ^ { 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } - 1 ) \times 3 0 } { 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } = 3 0 . 3 7 8

$$  

Also $M _ { \scriptscriptstyle 2 } = 9 3 6 . 9$ so that $\sigma = 1 7 . 4 1 \%$ . The option can be valued as a futures option with $F _ { 0 } = 3 0 . 3 7 8$ , $K = 3 0$ , $r = 5 \%$ , $\sigma = 1 7 . 4 1 \%$ , and $t = 0 . 5$ . The price is 1.637.  

# 26.22  

The price of a regular European call option is 7.116. The price of the down-and-out call option is 4.696. The price of the down-and-in call option is 2.419.  

The price of a regular European call is the sum of the prices of down-and-out and down-andin options.  

26.23  

When $r = q$ in the expression for a floating lookback call in Section 26.11 $a _ { 1 } = a _ { 3 }$ and $Y _ { 1 } { = } \ln ( S _ { 0 } ^ { \mathrm { ~ } } / S _ { \mathrm { m i n } } ^ { \mathrm { ~ } } )$ so that the expression for a floating lookback call becomes  

$$

S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } N ( a _ { 1 } ) - S _ { \mathrm { m i n } } e ^ { - r T } N ( a _ { 2 } )

$$  

As $q$ approaches $r$ in Section 26.13, we get  

$$

M _ { \mathrm { 1 } } = S _ { \mathrm { 0 } }

$$  

$$

M _ { 2 } = \frac { 2 e ^ { \sigma ^ { 2 } T } S _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } } { \sigma ^ { 4 } T ^ { 2 } } - \frac { 2 S _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } } { T ^ { 2 } } \frac { 1 + \sigma ^ { 2 } T } { \sigma ^ { 4 } }

$$  

A proof of these results requires L’Hopital’s rule where to get the limit of $0 / 0$ we differentiate the numerator and denominator.  

# 26.24  

In this case, DerivaGem shows that $Q ( K _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 1 7 7 2 , Q ( K _ { 2 } ) = 1 . 1 8 5 7$ , $\mathcal { Q } ( K _ { 3 } ) = 4 . 9 1 2 3$ , $Q ( K _ { 4 } ) = 1 4 . 2 3 7 4$ , $Q ( K _ { 5 } ) = 4 5 . 3 7 3 8$ , $Q ( K _ { 6 } ) = 3 5 . 9 2 4 3$ , $\mathcal { Q } ( K _ { 7 } ) = 2 0 . 6 8 8 3$ , $Q ( K _ { 8 } ) = 1 1 . 4 1 3 5$ , $\mathcal { Q } ( K _ { 9 } ) = 6 . 1 0 4 3$ . $\hat { E } ( \overline { { V } } ) = 0 . 0 5 0 2$ . The value of the variance swap is $\$ 0.51$ million.  

# 26.25  

When $q { = } 0$ , $w { = } r { - } \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2$ so that $\lvert \alpha _ { 1 } = 1$ and $\scriptstyle { \alpha _ { 2 } = 2 r / \sigma ^ { 2 } }$ . This is consistent with the results for perpetual derivatives in Section 15.6.  

# 26.26  

The price of the option is 3.528.  

(a) The option price is a humped function of the stock price with the maximum option price occurring for a stock price of about $\$ 57$ . If you could choose the stock price there would be a trade off. High stock prices give a high probability that the option will be knocked out. Low stock prices give a low potential payoff. For a stock price less than $\$ 57$ , delta is positive (as it is for a regular call option); for a stock price greater than $\$ 57$ , delta is negative.   
(b) Delta increases up to a stock price of about 45 and then decreases. This shows that gamma can be positive or negative.   
(c) The option price is a humped function of the time to maturity with the maximum option price occurring for a time to maturity of 0.5 years. This is because too long a time to maturity means that the option has a high probability of being knocked out; too short a time to maturity means that the option has a low potential payoff. For a time to maturity less than 0.5 years, theta is negative (as it is for a regular call option); for a time to maturity greater than 0.5 years, the theta of the option is positive.   
(d) The option price is also a humped function of volatility with the maximum option price being obtained for a volatility of about $20 \%$ . This is because too high a volatility means that the option has a high probability of being knocked out; too low volatility means that the option has a low potential payoff. For volatilities less than $20 \%$ , vega is positive (as it is for a regular option); for volatilities above $20 \%$ vega is negative.  

26.27  

(a) Both approaches use a one call option with a strike price of 50 and a maturity of 0.75. In the first approach, the other 15 call options have strike prices of 60 and equally spaced times to maturity. In the second approach, the other 15 call options have strike prices of 60, but the spacing between the times to maturity decreases as the maturity of the barrier option is approached. The second approach to setting times to maturity produces a better hedge. This is because the chance of the barrier being hit at time $t$ is an increasing function of $t$ . As $t$ increases, it therefore becomes more important to replicate the barrier at time $t$ .  

(b) By using either trial and error or the Solver tool, we see that we come closest to matching the price of the barrier option when the maturities of the third and fourth options are changed from 0.25 and 0.5 to 0.39 and 0.65. (c) To calculate delta for the two 16-option hedge strategies, it is necessary to change the last argument of EPortfolio from 0 to 1 in cells L42 and X42. To calculate delta for the barrier option, it is necessary to change the last argument of BarrierOption in cell F12 from 0 to 1. To calculate gamma and vega, the arguments must be changed to 2 and 3, respectively. The delta, gamma, and vega of the barrier option are $- 0 . 0 2 2 1 , -$   
0.0035, and –0.0254. The delta, gamma, and vega of the first 16-option portfolio are –   
0.0262, –0.0045, and –0.1470. The delta, gamma, and vega of the second 16-option portfolio are –0.0199, –0.0037, and –0.1449. The second of the two 16-option portfolios provides Greek letters that are closest to the Greek letters of the barrier option. Interestingly, neither of the two portfolios does particularly well on vega.  

# 26.28  

A natural approach is to attempt to replicate the option with positions in:  

(a) A European call option with strike price 1.00 maturing in two years.   
(b) A European put option with strike price 0.80 maturing in two years.   
(c) A European put option with strike price 0.80 maturing in 1.5 years.   
(d) A European put option with strike price 0.80 maturing in 1.0 years.   
(e) A European put option with strike price 0.80 maturing in 0.5 years.  

The first option can be used to match the value of the down-and-out-call for $t = 2$ and $S > 1 . 0 0$ . The others can be used to match it at the following $( t , S )$ points: (1.5, 0.80), (1.0, 0.80), (0.5, 0.80), (0.0, 0.80). Following the procedure in the text, we find that the required positions in the options are as shown in the following table.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Option Type</td><td>Strike Price</td><td>Maturity (yrs)</td><td>Position</td></tr><tr><td>Call</td><td>1.0</td><td>2.00</td><td>+1.0000</td></tr><tr><td>Put</td><td>0.8</td><td>2.00</td><td>-0.1255</td></tr><tr><td>Put</td><td>0.8</td><td>1.50</td><td>-0.1758</td></tr><tr><td>Put</td><td>0.8</td><td>1.00</td><td>-0.0956</td></tr><tr><td>Put</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.50</td><td>-0.0547</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The values of the options at the relevant $( t , S )$ points are as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Value initially</td><td>Value at (1.5,0.8)</td><td>Value at (1.0,0.8)</td><td>Value at (0.5,0.8)</td><td>Value at (0,0.8)</td></tr><tr><td>Option (a)</td><td>0.0735</td><td>0.0071</td><td>0.0199</td><td>0.0313</td><td>0.0410</td></tr><tr><td>Option (b)</td><td>0.0736</td><td>0.0568</td><td>0.0792</td><td>0.0953</td><td>0.1079</td></tr><tr><td>Option (c)</td><td>0.0603</td><td></td><td>0.0568</td><td>0.0792</td><td>0.0953</td></tr><tr><td>Option (d)</td><td>0.0440</td><td></td><td></td><td>0.0568</td><td>0.0792</td></tr><tr><td>Option (e)</td><td>0.0231</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0.0568</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The value of the portfolio initially is 0.0482. This is only a little less than the value of the down-and-out-option which is 0.0488. This example is different from the example in the text in a number of ways. Put options and call options are used in the replicating portfolio. The value of the replicating portfolio converges to the value of the option from below rather than from above. Also, even with relatively few options, the value of the replicating portfolio is close to the value of the down-and-out option.  

# 26.29  

In this case,   
N $\begin{array} { r } { \mathcal { A } _ { 1 } = ( 9 0 0 e ^ { ( 0 . 0 5 - 0 . 0 3 ) \times 0 . 2 5 } + 9 0 0 e ^ { ( 0 . 0 5 - 0 . 0 3 ) \times 0 . 5 0 } + 9 0 0 e ^ { ( 0 . 0 5 - 0 . 0 3 ) \times 0 . 7 5 } + 9 0 0 e ^ { ( 0 . 0 5 - 0 . 0 3 ) \times 1 } ) / 4 = 9 1 7 . 0 \% } \end{array}$ and a more complicated calculation involving 16 terms shows that $M _ { 2 } { = } 9 0 7 { , } 4 8 6 { . } 6$   
so that the option can be valued as an option on futures where the futures price is 917.07 and volatility is $\sqrt { \ln ( 9 0 7 , 4 8 6 . 6 / 9 1 7 . 0 7 ^ { 2 } }$ or $2 7 . 5 8 \%$ . The value of the option is 103.13.   
DerivaGem gives the price as 86.77 (set option type $\underline { { \underline { { \mathbf { \Pi } } } } } = \underline { { \underline { { \mathbf { \Pi } } } } }$ Asian). The higher price for the first option arises because the average is calculated from prices at times 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00. The mean of these times is 0.625. By contrast, the corresponding mean when the price is observed continuously is 0.50. The later a price is observed the more uncertain it is and the more it contributes to the value of the option.  

# 26.30  

For the regular option, the theoretical price is about $\$ 240,000$ . For the average price option, the theoretical price is about 115,000. My 20 simulation runs (40 outcomes because of the antithetic calculations) gave results as shown in the following table.  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Regular Call</td><td>Ave Price Call</td></tr><tr><td>Ave Hedging Cost</td><td>247,628</td><td>114,837</td></tr><tr><td>SD Hedging Cost</td><td>17,833</td><td>12,123</td></tr><tr><td>Ave Trading Vol (20 wks)</td><td>412,440</td><td>291,237</td></tr><tr><td>Ave Trading Vol (last 10 wks)</td><td>187,074</td><td>51,658</td></tr></table></body></html>  

These results show that the standard deviation of using delta hedging for an average price option is lower than that for a regular option. However, using the criterion in Chapter 19 (standard deviation divided by value of option) hedge performance is better for the regular option. Hedging the average price option requires less trading, particularly in the last 10 weeks. This is because we become progressively more certain about the average price as the maturity of the option is approached.  

# 26.31  

The value of the option is 1093. It is necessary to change cells F20 and F46 to 0.67. Cells G20 to G39 and G46 to G65 must be changed to calculate delta of the compound option. Cells H20 to H39 and H46 to H65 must be changed to calculate gamma of the compound option. Cells I20 to I40 and I46 to I66 must be changed to calculate the Black–Scholes price of the call option expiring in 40 weeks. Similarly, cells J20 to J40 and J46 to J66 must be changed to calculate the delta of this option; cells K20 to K40 and K46 to K66 must be changed to calculate the gamma of the option. The payoffs in cells N9 and N10 must be calculated as $\mathrm { M A X } ( \mathrm { I } 4 0 { - } 0 . 0 1 5 , 0 ) ^ { \ast } 1 0 0 , 0 0 0$ and $\mathrm { M A X } ( \mathrm { I 6 6 - 0 . 0 1 5 , 0 } ) ^ { \ast } 1 0 0 , 0 0 0$ . Delta plus gamma hedging works relatively poorly for the compound option. On 20 simulation runs the cost of writing and hedging the option ranged from 200 to 2,500.  

# 26.32  

a) The outperformance certificate is equivalent to a package consisting of:  

(i) A zero coupon bond that pays off $S _ { 0 }$ at time $T .$   
(ii) A long position in $k$ one-year European call options on the stock with a strike price equal to the current stock price.   
(iii)A short position in $k$ one-year European call options on the stock with a strike price equal to $M .$   
(iv)A short position in one European one-year put option on the stock with a strike price equal to the current stock price.  

b) In this case, the present value of the four parts of the package are:  

(i) $5 0 \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 1 } { = } 4 7 . 5 6$ (ii) $1 . 5 { \times } 5 . 0 0 5 6 { = } 7 . 5 0 8 4$ (iii) $- 1 . 5 { \times } 0 . 6 3 3 9 = - 0 . 9 5 0 9$ (iv) –4.5138  

The total of these is $4 7 . 5 6 + 7 . 5 0 8 4 - 0 . 9 5 0 9 - 4 . 5 1 3 8 = 4 9 . 6 .$ This is less than the initial investment of 50.  

# 26.33  

In this case, $F _ { 0 } = 1 0 2 2 . 5 5$ and DerivaGem shows that $Q ( K _ { 1 } ) = 0 . 0 3 6 6$ , $\mathcal { Q } ( K _ { 2 } ) = 0 . 2 8 5 8$ , $\begin{array} { r } { Q ( K _ { 3 } ) = 1 . 5 8 2 2 } \end{array}$ , $\mathcal { Q } ( K _ { 4 } ) = 6 . 3 7 0 8$ , $\mathcal { Q } ( K _ { 5 } ) = 3 0 . 3 8 6 4$ , $Q ( K _ { 6 } ) = 1 6 . 9 2 3 3$ , $Q ( K _ { 7 } ) = 4 . 8 1 8 0$ , $\mathcal { Q } ( K _ { 8 } ) = 0 . 8 6 3 9$ , and $\mathcal { Q } _ { 9 } = 0 . 0 8 6 3$ . $\hat { E } ( \overline { { V } } ) = 0 . 0 6 6 1$ . The value of the variance swap is $\$ 2.09$ million.  

# 26.34  

With the notation in the text, a regular call option with strike price $K _ { 2 }$ plus a binary call option that pays off $K _ { 2 } - K _ { 1 }$ is a gap call option that pays off $S _ { T } { - } K _ { 1 }$ when $S _ { T } { > } K _ { 2 }$ .  

# 26.35  

Suppose that there are $n$ periods each of length $\boldsymbol { \tau }$  the risk-free interest rate is $r$ , the dividend yield on the index is $q$ , and the volatility of the index is $\sigma$ . The value of the investment is  

$$

e ^ { - r n \tau } \mathcal { Q } \hat { E } \Bigg [ \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \operatorname* { m a x } \left( 1 + R _ { i } , 1 \right) \Bigg ]

$$  

where $R _ { i }$ is the return in period $i$ and as usual $\hat { E }$ denotes expected value in a risk-neutral world. Because (assuming efficient markets) the returns in successive periods are independent, this is  

$$

\begin{array} { l } { { \displaystyle e ^ { - r n \tau } \cal Q \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \left\{ \hat { E } [ \operatorname* { m a x } \left( 1 + R _ { i } , 1 \right) ] \right\} } \ ~ } \\ { { \displaystyle = e ^ { - r n \tau } \cal Q \prod _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \left\{ \hat { E } \biggl [ 1 + \operatorname* { m a x } \biggl ( \frac { S _ { i } - S _ { i - 1 } } { S _ { i - 1 } } , 0 \biggr ) \biggr ] \right\} } } \end{array}

$$  

where $S _ { i }$ is the value of the index at the end of the ith period.  

From Black–Scholes–Merton, the risk-neutral expectation at time $( i - 1 ) \tau$ of $\mathrm { m a x } ( S _ { i } – S _ { i - 1 } , 0 )$ is  

$$

e ^ { ( r - q ) \tau } S _ { i - 1 } N ( d _ { 1 } ) - S _ { i - 1 } N ( d _ { 2 } )

$$  

where  

$$

\begin{array} { l } { d _ { 1 } = \displaystyle \frac { ( r - q + \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) \tau } { \sigma \sqrt { \tau } } } \\ { d _ { 2 } = \displaystyle \frac { ( r - q - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ) \tau } { \sigma \sqrt { \tau } } } \end{array}

$$  

The value of the investment is therefore,  

$$

e ^ { - r m \tau } \mathcal { Q } \big [ 1 + e ^ { ( r - q ) \tau } N ( d _ { 1 } ) - N \big ( d _ { 2 } \big ) \big ] ^ { n }

$$

27.1 It follows immediately from the equations in Section 27.1 that  

$$

p - c = K e ^ { - r T } - S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T }

$$  

in all cases.  

# 27.2  

In this case, $\lambda ^ { \prime } { = } 0 . 3 { \times } 1 . 5 { = } 0 . 4 5$ . The variable $f _ { n }$ is the Black–Scholes–Merton price when the variance rate is $0 . 2 5 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 2 5 n = 0 . 0 6 2 5 + 0 . 2 5 n$ and the risk-free rate is $- 0 . 1 + n \times \ln ( 1 . 5 ) = -$ $0 . 1 { + } 0 . 4 0 5 5 n$ . A spreadsheet can be constructed to value the option using the first (say) 20 terms in the Merton expansion.  

$$

\sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { e ^ { - \lambda ^ { \prime } T } ( \lambda ^ { \prime } T ) ^ { n } } { n ! } f _ { n }

$$  

The result is 5.47 which is also the price given by DerivaGem.  

27.3 With the notation in the text the value of a call option, $c$ is  

$$

\sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } { \frac { e ^ { - \lambda ^ { \prime } T } ( \lambda ^ { \prime } T ) ^ { n } } { n ! } } c _ { n }

$$  

where $c _ { n }$ is the Black–Scholes–Merton price of a call option where the variance rate is  

$$

\sigma ^ { 2 } + \frac { n s ^ { 2 } } { T }

$$  

and the risk-free rate is  

$$

r - \lambda k + { \frac { n \gamma } { T } }

$$  

where $\gamma = \ln ( 1 + k )$ . Similarly, the value of a put option $p$ is  

$$

\sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { e ^ { - \lambda ^ { \prime } T } ( \lambda ^ { \prime } T ) ^ { n } } { n ! } p _ { n }

$$  

where ${ \boldsymbol { p } } _ { n }$ is the Black–Scholes–Merton price of a put option with this variance rate and risk-free rate. It follows that  

$$

p - c = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { e ^ { - \lambda ^ { \prime } T } ( \lambda ^ { \prime } T ) ^ { n } } { n ! } ( p _ { n } - c _ { n } )

$$  

From put–call parity  

$$

p _ { n } - c _ { n } = K e ^ { ( - r + \lambda k ) T } e ^ { - n \gamma } - S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T }

$$  

Because  

$$

e ^ { - n \gamma } = ( 1 + k ) ^ { - n }

$$  

it follows that  

$$

p - c = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { e ^ { - \lambda ^ { \prime } T + \lambda k T } \left( \lambda ^ { \prime } T / \left( 1 + k \right) \right) ^ { n } } { n ! } K e ^ { - r T } - \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { e ^ { - \lambda ^ { \prime } T } \left( \lambda ^ { \prime } T \right) ^ { n } } { n ! } S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T }

$$  

Using $\lambda ^ { \prime } = \lambda ( 1 + k )$ this becomes  

$$

\frac { 1 } { e ^ { \lambda T } } \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { ( \lambda T ) ^ { n } } { n ! } K e ^ { - r T } - \frac { 1 } { e ^ { \lambda T } } \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { ( \lambda ^ { \prime } T ) ^ { n } } { n ! } S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T }

$$  

From the expansion of the exponential function, we get  

$$

e ^ { \lambda T } = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } { \frac { ( \lambda T ) ^ { n } } { n ! } }

$$  

$$

e ^ { \lambda ^ { \prime } T } = \sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \infty } \frac { ( \lambda ^ { \prime } T ) ^ { n } } { n ! }

$$  

Hence,  

$$

p - c = K e ^ { - r T } - S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T }

$$  

showing that put–call parity holds.  

# 27.4  

The average variance rate is  

$$

\frac { 6 \times 0 . 2 ^ { 2 } + 6 \times 0 . 2 2 ^ { 2 } + 1 2 \times 0 . 2 4 ^ { 2 } } { 2 4 } = 0 . 0 5 0 9

$$  

The volatility used should be $\sqrt { 0 . 0 5 0 9 } = 0 . 2 2 5 6$ or $2 2 . 5 6 \%$ .  

27.5 In a risk-neutral world, the process for the asset price exclusive of jumps is  

$$

\frac { d S } { S } = ( r - q - \lambda k ) d t + \sigma d z

$$  

In this case, $k = - 1$ so that the process is  

$$

\frac { d S } { S } = ( r - q + \lambda ) d t + \sigma d z

$$  

The asset behaves like a stock paying a dividend yield of $q - \lambda$ . This shows that, conditional on no jumps, call price  

$$

S _ { 0 } e ^ { - ( q - \lambda ) T } N ( d _ { 1 } ) - K e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } )

$$  

where  

$$

d _ { 1 } = \frac { \ln ( S _ { 0 } / { K } ) + ( r - q + \lambda + \sigma ^ { 2 } / { 2 } ) T } { \sigma \sqrt { T } }

$$  

There is a probability of $e ^ { - \lambda T }$ that there will be no jumps and a probability of $1 - e ^ { - \lambda T }$ that there  

will be one or more jumps so that the final asset price is zero. It follows that there is a probability of $e ^ { - \lambda T }$ that the value of the call is given by the above equation and $1 - e ^ { - \lambda T }$ that it will be zero. Because jumps have no systematic risk, it follows that the value of the call option is  

$$

e ^ { - \lambda T } \Bigl [ S _ { 0 } e ^ { - ( q - \lambda ) T } N ( d _ { 1 } ) - K e ^ { - r T } N ( d _ { 2 } ) \Bigr ]

$$  

or  

$$

S _ { 0 } e ^ { - q T } N ( d _ { 1 } ) - K e ^ { - ( r + \lambda ) T } N ( d _ { 2 } )

$$  

This is the required result. The value of a call option is an increasing function of the risk-free interest rate (see Chapter 11). It follows that the possibility of jumps increases the value of the call option in this case.  

# 27.6  

Suppose that $S _ { 1 }$ is the stock price at time $t _ { 1 }$ and $S _ { T }$ is the stock price at time $T .$ From equation (15.3), it follows that in a risk- neutral world:  

$$

\ln S _ { 1 } - \ln S _ { 0 } \sim \varphi \left[ \left( r _ { 1 } - \frac { \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \right) t _ { 1 } , \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } t _ { 1 } \right]

$$  

$$

\ln S _ { \cal T } - \ln S _ { 1 } \sim \varphi \left[ \left( r _ { 2 } - \frac { \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \right) t _ { 2 } , \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } t _ { 2 } \right]

$$  

Since the sum of two independent normal distributions is normal with mean equal to the sum of the means and variance equal to the sum of the variances,  

$$

\begin{array} { l } { \displaystyle \ln S _ { _ T } - \ln S _ { 0 } = ( \ln S _ { _ T } - \ln S _ { 1 } ) + ( \ln S _ { _ 1 } - \ln S _ { 0 } ) } \\ { \displaystyle ~ \sim \varphi \Biggl ( r _ { 1 } t _ { 1 } + r _ { 2 } t _ { 2 } - \frac { \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } t _ { 1 } } { 2 } - \frac { \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } t _ { 2 } } { 2 } , \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } t _ { 1 } + \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } t _ { 2 } \Biggr ) } \end{array}

$$  

(a) Because  

$$

r _ { 1 } t _ { 1 } + r _ { 2 } t _ { 2 } = \overline { { r } } T

$$  

and  

$$

\sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } t _ { 1 } + \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } t _ { 2 } = \overline { { V } } T

$$  

it follows that:  

$$

\ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } - \ln S _ { 0 } \sim \varphi \Biggl [ \Biggl [ \bar { r } - \frac { \overline { { V } } } { 2 } \Biggr ) T , \overline { { V } } T \Biggr ]

$$  

(b) If $\sigma _ { i }$ and $r _ { i }$ are the volatility and risk-free interest rate during the $i$ th subinterval $( i = 1 , 2 , 3 )$ ) , an argument similar to that in (a) shows that:  

$$

\ln S _ { T } - \ln S _ { 0 } \sim \varphi \left( r _ { 1 } t _ { 1 } + r _ { 2 } t _ { 2 } + r _ { 3 } t _ { 3 } - { \frac { \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } t _ { 1 } } { 2 } } - { \frac { \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } t _ { 2 } } { 2 } } - { \frac { \sigma _ { 3 } ^ { 2 } t _ { 3 } } { 2 } } , \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } t _ { 1 } + \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } t _ { 2 } + \sigma _ { 3 } ^ { 2 } t _ { 3 } \right)

$$  

where $t _ { 1 } , t _ { 2 }$ and $t _ { 3 }$ are the lengths of the three subintervals. It follows that the result in (b) is still true.  

(c)  The result in (b) remains true as the time between time zero and time $T$ is divided into more subintervals, each having its own risk-free interest rate and volatility. In the limit, it follows that, if $r$ and $\sigma$ are known functions of time, the stock price distribution at time $T$ is the same as that for a stock with a constant interest rate and variance rate with the constant interest rate equal to the average interest rate and the constant variance rate equal to the average variance rate.  

# 27.7  

The equations are:  

$$

\begin{array} { c } { { S ( t + \Delta t ) = S ( t ) \exp [ ( r - q - V ( t ) / 2 ) \Delta t + \varepsilon _ { \mathrm { 1 } } \sqrt { V ( t ) \Delta t } ] } } \\ { { { } } } \\ { { V ( t + \Delta t ) - V ( t ) = a [ V _ { \mathrm { _ L } } - V ( t ) ] \Delta t + \xi \varepsilon _ { \mathrm { 2 } } V ( t ) ^ { \alpha } \sqrt { \Delta t } } } \end{array}

$$  

where $\displaystyle \varepsilon _ { 1 }$ and $\varepsilon _ { 2 }$ are samples from a standard normal distribution with a correlation equal to the correlation between $S$ and $V$ .  

# 27.8  

The IVF model is designed to match the volatility surface today. There is no guarantee that the volatility surface given by the model at future times will reflect the true evolution of the volatility surface.  

# 27.9  

The IVF model ensures that the risk-neutral probability distribution of the asset price at any future time conditional on its value today is correct (or at least consistent with the market prices of options). When a derivative’s payoff depends on the value of the asset at only one time the IVF model therefore calculates the expected payoff from the asset correctly.  

# 27.10  

In this case, $S _ { 0 } = 1 . 6$ , $r = 0 . 0 5$ , $r _ { f } = 0 . 0 8$ , $\sigma = 0 . 1 5$ , $T = 1 . 5$ , $\Delta t = 0 . 5$ . This means that  

$$

u = e ^ { 0 . 1 5 { \sqrt { 0 . 5 } } } = 1 . 1 1 1 9

$$  

$$

d = \frac { 1 } { u } = 0 . 8 9 9 4

$$  

$$

a = e ^ { ( 0 . 0 5 - 0 . 0 8 ) \times 0 . 5 } = 0 . 9 8 5 1

Figure S27.1:  Binomial tree for Problem 27.10  

The tree is shown in Figure S27.1. At each node, the upper number is the exchange rate, the middle number(s) are the minimum exchange rate(s) so far, and the lower number(s) are the value(s) of the option. The tree shows that the value of the option today is 0.131.  

# 27.11  

As $\nu$ tends to zero, the value of $g$ becomes $T$ with certainty. This can be demonstrated using the GAMMADIST function in Excel. By using a series expansion for the ln  function, we see that $\omega$ becomes $- \theta T$ . In the limit, the distribution of ln $S _ { T }$ therefore has a mean of $\ln S _ { 0 } + ( r - q ) T$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma \sqrt { T }$ so that the model becomes geometric Brownian motion.  

27.12 In this case, $S _ { 0 } = 4 0$ , $K = 4 0$ , $r = 0 . 1$ , $\sigma = 0 . 3 5$ , $T = 0 . 2 5$ , $\Delta t = 0 . 0 8 3 3 3$ . This means that  

$$

u = e ^ { 0 . 3 5 \sqrt { 0 . 0 8 3 3 3 } } = 1 . 1 0 6 3

$$  

$$

d = \frac { 1 } { u } = 0 . 9 0 3 9

The option pays off  

where $\overline { { S } }$ denotes the geometric average. The tree is shown in Figure S27.2. At each node, the upper number is the stock price, the middle number(s) are the geometric average(s), and the lower number(s) are the value(s) of the option. The geometric averages are calculated using the first, the last and all intermediate stock prices on the path. The tree shows that the value of the option today is $\$ 1.40$ .

As mentioned in Section 27.5, for the procedure to work it must be possible to calculate the value of the path function at time $\tau + \Delta t$ from the value of the path function at time $\tau$ and the value of the underlying asset at time ${ \boldsymbol { \tau } } + \Delta { \boldsymbol { t } }$ . When $S _ { \mathrm { a v e } }$ is calculated from time zero until the end of the life of the option (as in the example considered in Section 27.5), this condition is satisfied. When it is calculated over the last three months, it is not satisfied. This is because, in order to  

update the average with a new observation on $S$ , it is necessary to know the observation on $S$ from three months ago that is now no longer part of the average calculation.  

# 27.14  

We consider the situation where the average at node $\mathrm { \Delta X }$ is 53.83. If there is an up movement to node Y, the new average becomes:  

$$

\frac { 5 3 . 8 3 \times 5 + 5 4 . 6 8 } { 6 } = 5 3 . 9 7

$$  

Interpolating, the value of the option at node $\mathrm { Y }$ when the average is 53.97 is  

$$

\frac { ( 5 3 . 9 7 - 5 1 . 1 2 ) \times 8 . 6 3 5 + ( 5 4 . 2 6 - 5 3 . 9 7 ) \times 8 . 1 0 1 } { 5 4 . 2 6 - 5 1 . 1 2 } = 8 . 5 8 6

$$  

Similarly, if there is a down movement the new average will be  

$$

\frac { 5 3 . 8 3 \times 5 + 4 5 . 7 2 } { 6 } = 5 2 . 4 8

$$  

In this case, the option price is 4.416. The option price at node $\mathrm { \Delta X }$ when the average is 53.83 is therefore:  

$$

8 . 5 8 6 \times 0 . 5 0 5 6 + 4 . 4 1 6 \times 0 . 4 9 4 4 ) e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 0 . 0 5 } = 6 . 4 9 2

$$  

# 27.15  

Under the least squares approach, we exercise at time $t = 1$ in paths 4, 6, 7, and 8. We exercise at time $t = 2$ for none of the paths. We exercise at time $t = 3$ for path 3. Under the exercise boundary parameterization approach, we exercise at time $t = 1$ for paths 6 and 8. We exercise at time $t = 2$ for path 7. We exercise at time $t = 3$ for paths 3 and 4. For the paths sampled, the exercise boundary parameterization approach gives a higher value for the option. However, it may be biased upward. As mentioned in the text, once the early exercise boundary has been determined in the exercise boundary parameterization approach, a new Monte Carlo simulation should be carried out.

If the average variance rate is 0.06, the value of the option is given by Black–Scholes with a volatility of $\sqrt { 0 . 0 6 } = 2 4 . 4 9 5 \%$ ; it is 12.460. If the average variance rate is 0.09, the value of the option is given by Black-Scholes with a volatility of $\sqrt { 0 . 0 9 } = 3 0 . 0 0 0 \%$ ; it is 14.655. If the average variance rate is 0.12, the value of the option is given by Black–Scholes–Merton with a volatility of ${ \sqrt { 0 . 1 2 } } = 3 4 . 6 4 1 \%$ ; it is 16.506. The value of the option is the Black–Scholes– Merton price integrated over the probability distribution of the average variance rate. It is

Suppose that there are two horizontal barriers, $H _ { \mathfrak { r } }$ and $H _ { \sb { 2 } }$ , with $H _ { 1 } < H _ { 2 }$ and that the underlying stock price follows geometric Brownian motion. In a trinomial tree, there are three possible movements in the asset’s price at each node: up by a proportional amount $u$ ; stay the same; and down by a proportional amount $d$ where $d = 1 / u$ . We can always choose $u$ so that nodes lie on both barriers. The condition that must be satisfied by $u$ is  

$$

\boldsymbol { H _ { 2 } } = \boldsymbol { H _ { 1 } } \boldsymbol { u } ^ { \boldsymbol { N } }

$$  

or  

$$

\ln H _ { 2 } = \ln H _ { 1 } + N \ln u

$$  

for some integer $N$ .  

When discussing trinomial trees in Section 21.4, the value suggested for $u$ was $e ^ { \sigma { \sqrt { 3 \Delta t } } }$ so that $\ln u = \sigma \sqrt { 3 \Delta t }$ . In the situation considered here, a good rule is to choose $\ln { u }$ as close as possible to this value, consistent with the condition given above. This means that we set  

$$

\ln u = \frac { \ln H _ { 2 } - \ln H _ { 1 } } { N }

$$  

where  

$$

N = \mathrm { i n t } \Bigg [ \frac { \ln H _ { 2 } - \ln H _ { 1 } } { \sigma \sqrt { 3 \Delta t } } + 0 . 5 \Bigg ]

$$  

and $\operatorname { i n t } ( x )$ is the integral part of $x$ . This means that nodes are at values of the stock price equal to $H _ { 1 }$ , $H _ { 1 } u$ , $H _ { 1 } u ^ { 2 }$ , …, H1uN  H2  

Normally, the trinomial stock price tree is constructed so that the central node is the initial stock price. In this case, it is unlikely that the current stock price happens to be $H _ { 1 } u ^ { i }$ for some $i$ . To deal with this, the first trinomial movement should be from the initial stock price to $H _ { 1 } u ^ { i - 1 }$ , $H _ { 1 } u ^ { i }$ and $H _ { 1 } u ^ { i + 1 }$ where $i$ is chosen so that $H _ { 1 } u ^ { i }$ is closest to the current stock price. The probabilities on all branches of the tree are chosen, as usual, to match the first two moments of the stochastic process followed by the asset price. The approach works well except when the initial asset price is close to a barrier.

In this case, $\Delta t = 0 . 5$ , $\lambda = 0 . 0 3$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2 5$ , $r = 0 . 0 6$ and $q = 0$ so that $\scriptstyle u = 1 . 1 9 3 4$ , $d = 0 . 8 3 8 0$ , $a = 1 . 0 3 0 5$ , $p _ { u } = 0 . 5 7 6 7$ , $ { p _ { d } }  { = } 0 . 4 0 8 4$ , and the probability on default branches is 0.0149. This leads to the tree shown in Figure S27.3. The bond is called at nodes B and D and this forces exercise. Without the call the value at node D would be 142.92, the value at node B would be 122.87, and the value at node A would be 108.29. The value of the call option to the bond issuer is therefore $1 0 8 . 2 9 - 1 0 6 . 3 1 = 1 . 9 8$ .

Using three-month time steps, the tree parameters are $\Delta { t } = 0 . 2 5$ , $u = 1 . 1 0 5 2$ , $d = 0 . 9 0 4 8$ , $a = 1 . 0 0 5 0$ , $p = 0 . 5 0 0 0$ . The tree is shown in Figure S27.4. The alternative minimum values of the stock price are shown in the middle box at each node. The value of the floating lookback option is 40.47.) DerivaGem shows that the value given by the analytic formula is 53.38. This is higher than the value given by the tree because the tree assumes that the stock price is observed only three times when the minimum is calculated.

We construct a tree for $Y ( t ) = G ( t ) / S ( t )$ where $G ( t )$ is the minimum value of the index to date and $S ( t )$ is the value of the index at time $t$ . The tree is shown in Figure S27.5. It values the option in units of the stock index. This means that we value an instrument that pays off $1 - Y ( t )$ . The tree shows that the value of the option is 0.1012 units of the stock index or $4 0 0 \times 0 . 1 0 1 2$ or 40.47 dollars, as given by Figure S27.5.

(a) The six-month call option with a strike price of 1.05 should be valued with a volatility of $1 3 . 4 \%$ and is worth 0.01829. The call option with a strike price of 1.10 should be valued with a volatility of $1 4 . 3 \%$ and is worth 0.00959. The bull spread is therefore worth $0 . 0 1 8 2 9 - 0 . 0 0 9 5 9 = 0 . 0 0 8 7 0$ .  

(b) We now ask what volatility, if used to value both options, gives this price. Using the DerivaGem Application Builder in conjunction with Goal Seek, we find that the answer is $1 1 . 4 2 \%$ .  

(c) Yes, this does support the contention at the beginning of the chapter that the correct volatility for valuing exotic options can be counterintuitive. We might reasonably expect the volatility to be between $1 3 . 4 \%$ (the volatility used to value the first option) and $14 . 3 \%$ (the volatility used to value the second option). $1 1 . 4 2 \%$ is well outside this range. The reason why the volatility is relatively low is as follows. The option provides the same payoff as a regular option with a 1.05 strike price when the asset price is between 1.05 and 1.10 and a lower payoff when the asset price is over 1.10. The implied probability distribution of the asset price (see Figure 20.2) is less heavy than the lognormal distribution in the 1.05 to 1.10 range and heavier than the lognormal distribution in the $> 1 . 1 0$ range. This means that using a volatility of $1 3 . 4 \%$ (which is the implied volatility of a regular option with a strike price of 1.05) will give a price that is too high.  

(d) The bull spread provides a payoff at only one time. It is therefore correctly valued by the IVF model.  

# 27.22  

Consider first the least squares approach. At the two-year point, the option is in the money for paths 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7. The five observations on $S$ are 1.08, 1.07, 0.97, 0.77, and 0.84. The five continuation values are 0, $0 . 1 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 }$ , $0 . 2 1 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 }$ , $0 . 2 3 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 }$ , $0 . 1 2 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 }$ . The best fit continuation value is  

$$
- 1 . 3 9 4 + 3 . 7 9 5 S - 2 . 2 7 6 S ^ { 2 }
$$  

The best fit continuation values for the five paths are 0.0495, 0.0605, 0.1454, 0.1785, and 0.1876. These show that the option should be exercised for paths 1, 4, 6, and 7 at the two-year point.  

There are six paths at the one-year point for which the option is in the money. These are paths 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The six observations on $S$ are 1.09, 0.93, 1.11, 0.76, 0.92, and 0.88. The six continuation values are $0 . 0 5 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 }$ , $0 . 1 6 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 }$ , 0, $0 . 3 6 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 }$ , $0 . 2 9 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 }$ , and 0. The best fit continuation value is  

$$

2 . 0 5 5 - 3 . 3 1 7 S + 1 . 3 4 1 S ^ { 2 }

$$  

The best fit continuation values for the six paths are 0.0327, 0.1301, 0.0253, 0.3088, 0.1385, and 0.1746. These show that the option should be exercised at the one-year point for paths 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8. The value of the option if not exercised at time zero is therefore  

$$

\frac { 1 } { 8 } ( 0 . 0 4 e ^ { - ^ { 0 . 0 6 } } + 0 . 1 0 e ^ { - ^ { 0 . 1 8 } } + 0 . 2 0 e ^ { - ^ { 0 . 0 6 } } + 0 + 0 . 3 7 e ^ { - ^ { 0 . 0 6 } } + 0 . 2 1 e ^ { - ^ { 0 . 0 6 } } + 0 . 2 5 e ^ { - ^ { 0 . 0 6 } } )

$$  

or 0.136. Exercising at time zero would yield 0.13. The option should therefore not be exercised at time zero and its value is 0.136.  

Consider next the exercise boundary parameterization approach. At time two years, it is optimal to exercise when the stock price is 0.84 or below. At time one year, it is optimal to exercise whenever the option is in the money. The value of the option assuming no early exercise at time zero is therefore  

$$

\frac { 1 } { 8 } \left( 0 . 0 4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 } + 0 + 0 . 1 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 8 } + 0 . 2 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 } + 0 . 0 2 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 } \right)

$$  

$$
+ 0 . 3 7 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 } + 0 . 2 1 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 } + 0 . 2 5 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 } )
$$  

or  0.139. Exercising at time zero would yield 0.13. The option should therefore not be exercised at time zero. The value at time zero is 0.139. However, this tends to be high. As explained in the text, we should use one Monte Carlo simulation to determine the early exercise boundary. We should then carry out a new Monte Carlo simulation using the early exercise boundary to value the option.  

# 27.23 (Excel file)  

See Excel file. The results show that the SABR model can fit a wide variety of smiles.  

# 27.24  

(a) In this case, $t = 1 , \lambda = 0 . 0 2 / 0 . 7 = 0 . 0 2 8 5 7$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2 5$ , $r = 0 . 0 5$ , $q = 0$ , $u { = } 1 . 2 8 4 0$ , $d { = } 0 . 7 7 8 8$ , $a = 1 . 0 5 1 3$ , $p _ { u } = 0 . 5 8 2 7$ , $p _ { d } = 0 . 3 8 9 1$ , and the probability of a default is 0.0282. The calculations are shown in Figure S27.6. The values at the nodes include the value of the coupon paid just before the node is reached. The value of the convertible is 108.33.  

(b) The value if there is no conversion calculated from the same tree is  94.08. The value of the conversion option is therefore 14.25.  

(c) If it is called at node D just before the coupon payment the bond is converted but the coupon payment is not received, this reduces the value at the node to 144.26. Calling at node B will lead to conversion reducing the value to $\$ 1236$ . The value of the bond at node A is then 102.20.  

(d) A dividend payment would affect the way the tree is constructed as described in Chapter 21.

# 27.25  

Suppose that $U$ is the value if there is an up movement and $D$ is the value if there is a down movement. Because the value is zero in the event of a default, the text shows that the value at a node is  

$$

\left[ \left( \frac { e ^ { ( r - q ) \Delta t } - d e ^ { - \lambda \Delta t } } { u - d } \right) U + \left( \frac { u e ^ { - \lambda \Delta t } - e ^ { ( r - q ) \Delta t } } { u - d } \right) D \right] e ^ { - r \Delta t }

$$  

This is the same as  

$$

= \left[ \left( \frac { e ^ { ( r + \lambda - q ) \Delta t } - d } { u - d } \right) U + \left( \frac { u - e ^ { ( r + \lambda - q ) \Delta t } } { u - d } \right) D \right] e ^ { - ( r + \lambda ) \Delta t }

$$  

which proves the result.  

# CHAPTER 28 Martingales and Measures  

# Practice Questions  

# 28.1  

The market price of risk for a variable that is not the price of an investment asset is the market price of risk of an investment asset whose price is instantaneously perfectly positively correlated with the variable.  

# 28.2  

If its market price of risk is zero, gold must, after storage costs have been paid, provide an expected return equal to the risk-free rate of interest. In this case, the expected return after storage costs must be $6 \%$ per annum. It follows that the expected growth rate in the price of gold must be $7 \%$ per annum.  

# 28.3  

The market price of risk is  

$$

\frac { \mu - r } { \sigma }

$$  

This is the same for both securities. From the first security, we know it must be  

$$

\frac { 0 . 0 8 - 0 . 0 4 } { 0 . 1 5 } = 0 . 2 6 6 6 7

$$  

The volatility, $\sigma _ { \mathrm { { \ell } } }$ for the second security is given by  

$$

{ \frac { 0 . 1 2 - 0 . 0 4 } { \sigma } } = 0 . 2 6 6 6 7

$$  

The volatility is $30 \%$  

# 28.4  

It can be argued that the market price of risk for the second variable is zero. This is because the risk is unsystematic; that is, it is totally unrelated to other risks in the economy. To put this another way, there is no reason why investors should demand a higher return for bearing the risk since the risk can be totally diversified away.  

# 28.5  

Suppose that the price, $f ,$ of the derivative depends on the prices, $S _ { \mathrm { 1 } }$ and $S _ { 2 }$ , of two traded securities. Suppose further that:  

$$

d S _ { 1 } = \mu _ { 1 } S _ { 1 } d t + \sigma _ { 1 } S _ { 1 } d z _ { 1 }

$$  

$$

d S _ { 2 } = \mu _ { 2 } S _ { 2 } d t + \sigma _ { 2 } S _ { 2 } d z _ { 2 }

$$  

where $d z _ { 1 }$ and $d z _ { 2 }$ are Wiener processes with correlation $\rho$ . From Ito’s lemma  

$$

\begin{array} { l } { d f = \left( \mu _ { 1 } S _ { 1 } \displaystyle \frac { \partial f } { \partial S _ { 1 } } + \mu _ { 2 } S _ { 2 } \displaystyle \frac { \partial f } { \partial S _ { 2 } } + \frac { \partial f } { \partial t } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } S _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } \displaystyle \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } f } { \partial S _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } S _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } \displaystyle \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } f } { \partial S _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } } \right. } \\ { \displaystyle \left. + \rho \sigma _ { 1 } \sigma _ { 2 } S _ { 1 } S _ { 2 } \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } f } { \partial S _ { 1 } \partial S _ { 2 } } \right) d t + \sigma _ { 1 } S _ { 1 } \displaystyle \frac { \partial f } { \partial S _ { 1 } } d z _ { 1 } + \sigma _ { 2 } S _ { 2 } \displaystyle \frac { \partial f } { \partial S _ { 2 } } d z _ { 2 } } \end{array}

$$  

To eliminate the $d z _ { 1 }$ and $d z _ { 2 }$ we choose a portfolio, $\Pi$ , consisting of  

$$

\begin{array} { r l } { + \frac { \hat { \mathcal { O } } f } { \hat { \mathcal { O } } \Lambda _ { 1 } } : } & { \mathrm { f i r s t ~ t r a d e d s c u r i t y } } \\ { + \frac { \hat { \mathcal { O } } f } { \hat { \mathcal { O } } \Lambda _ { 2 } } : } & { \mathrm { s c c o n d u a d e d s c e u r i t y } } \\ { \Pi = - f + \frac { \hat { \mathcal { O } } f } { \hat { \mathcal { O } } \Lambda _ { 3 } } S _ { 1 } + \frac { \hat { \mathcal { O } } f } { \hat { \mathcal { O } } \Lambda _ { 2 } } S _ { 2 } } \\ { d \Pi = - d f + \frac { \hat { \mathcal { O } } f } { \hat { \mathcal { O } } \Lambda _ { 1 } } \frac { d S _ { 1 } } { \hat { \mathcal { O } } \Lambda _ { 2 } } d S _ { 2 } } \\ { - \left( \frac { \hat { \mathcal { O } } f } { \hat { \mathcal { O } } \Lambda _ { 1 } } + \frac { 1 } { \hat { \mathcal { O } } \Lambda _ { 1 } } \right) ^ { 2 } d S _ { 2 } } \end{array}

$$  

Since the portfolio is instantaneously risk-free, it must instantaneously earn the risk-free rate of interest. Hence,  

$$

d \Pi = r \Pi d t

$$  

Combining the above equations,  

$$
- \Biggl [ \frac { \partial f } { \partial t } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } S _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } f } { \partial S _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } S _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } f } { \partial S _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } } + \rho \sigma _ { 1 } \sigma _ { 2 } S _ { 1 } S _ { 2 } \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } f } { \partial S _ { 1 } \partial S _ { 2 } } \Biggr ] d t
$$  

$$

\mathbf { \Gamma } = r \Bigg [ - f + \frac { \partial f } { \partial S _ { 1 } } S _ { 1 } + \frac { \partial f } { \partial S _ { 2 } } S _ { 2 } \Bigg ] d t

$$  

so that:  

$$

\frac { \partial f } { \partial t } + r S _ { 1 } \frac { \partial f } { \partial S _ { 1 } } + r S _ { 2 } \frac { \partial f } { \partial S _ { 2 } } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } S _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } f } { \partial S _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } S _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } f } { \partial S _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } } + \rho \sigma _ { 1 } \sigma _ { 2 } S _ { 1 } S _ { 2 } \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } f } { \partial S _ { 1 } \partial S _ { 2 } } = r f

$$  

# 28.6  

The process for $x$ in a risk neutral world is from the end of Section 28.8,  

$$

d x = \left[ a ( x _ { 0 } - x ) - \lambda c \sqrt { x } \right] d t + c \sqrt { x } d z

$$  

Hence, the drift rate should be reduced by $\lambda c { \sqrt { x } }$ . In practice, $\lambda$ is negative so that the drift rate  

increases.  

# 28.7  

As suggested in the hint, we form a new security $f ^ { * }$ which is the same as $f$ except that all income produced by $f$ is reinvested in $f$ . Assuming we start doing this at time zero, the relationship between $f$ and $f ^ { * }$ is  

$$

\boldsymbol { f } ^ { * } = f \boldsymbol { \dot { e } } ^ { q t }

$$  

If $\mu ^ { * }$ and $\sigma ^ { * }$ are the expected return and volatility of $f ^ { * }$ , Ito’s lemma shows that  

$$

\mu ^ { * } = \mu + q

$$  

$$

\sigma ^ { * } = \sigma

$$  

From equation (28.9),  

$$

\mu ^ { * } - r = \lambda \sigma ^ { * }

$$  

It follows that  

$$

\mu { + } q { - } r { = } \lambda \sigma

$$  

# 28.8  

As suggested in the hint, we form two new securities $f ^ { * }$ and $g ^ { * }$ which are the same as $f$ and $g$ at time zero, but are such that income from $f$ is reinvested in $f$ and income from $g$ is reinvested in $g$ . By construction $f ^ { * }$ and $g ^ { \ast }$ are non-income producing and their values at time $t$ are related to $f$ and $g$ by  

$$

f ^ { * } = f e ^ { q _ { f } t } \qquad g ^ { * } = g e ^ { q _ { g } t }

$$  

From Ito’s lemma, the securities $g$ and $g ^ { * }$ have the same volatility. We can apply the analysis given in Section 28.3 to $f ^ { * }$ and $g ^ { * }$ so that from equation (28.15)  

$$

f _ { 0 } ^ { * } = g _ { 0 } ^ { * } E _ { g } \Bigg ( \frac { f _ { T } ^ { * } } { g _ { T } ^ { * } } \Bigg )

$$  

or  

$$

f _ { 0 } = g _ { 0 } E _ { g } \left( \frac { f _ { T } e ^ { q _ { f } T } } { g _ { T } e ^ { q _ { g } T } } \right)

$$  

or  

$$

f _ { 0 } = g _ { 0 } e ^ { ( q _ { f } - q _ { g } ) T } E _ { g } \left( \frac { f _ { T } } { g _ { T } } \right)

$$  

# 28.9  

This statement implies that the interest rate has a negative market price of risk. Since bond prices and interest rates are negatively correlated, the statement implies that the market price of risk for a bond price is positive. The statement is reasonable. When interest rates increase, there is a tendency for the stock market to decrease. This implies that interest rates have negative systematic risk, or equivalently that bond prices have positive systematic risk.  

# 28.10  

(a) In the traditional risk-neutral world, the process followed by $S$ is  

$$

d S = ( r - q ) S d t + \sigma _ { S } S d z

$$  

where $r$ is the instantaneous risk-free rate. The market price of $d z$ -risk is zero.  

(b) In the traditional risk-neutral world for currency B, the process is  

$$

d S = ( r - q + \rho _ { \varrho s } \sigma _ { s } \sigma _ { \varrho } ) S d t + \sigma _ { s } S d z

$$  

where $\boldsymbol { Q }$ is the exchange rate (units of A per unit of B), $\sigma _ { \it Q }$ is the volatility of $\boldsymbol { Q }$ and $\rho _ { \varrho s }$ is the coefficient of correlation between $\boldsymbol { Q }$ and $S$ . The market price of $d z$ -risk is $\rho _ { { Q S } } \sigma _ { { Q } }$ .  

(c) In a world defined by numeraire equal to a zero-coupon bond in currency A maturing at time $T$  

$$

d S = ( r - q + \rho _ { S P } \sigma _ { S } \sigma _ { P } ) S d t + \sigma _ { S } S d z

$$  

where $\sigma _ { P }$ is the bond price volatility and $\rho _ { { } _ { S P } }$ is the correlation between the stock and bond. The market price of $d z$ -risk is $\rho _ { { _ S P } } \sigma _ { { _ P } }$ .  

(d) In a world defined by a numeraire equal to a zero-coupon bond in currency $\mathbf { B }$ maturing at time $T$  

$$

d S = ( r - q + \rho _ { { S P } } \sigma _ { { S } } \sigma _ { { P } } + \rho _ { { F S } } \sigma _ { { S } } \sigma _ { { F } } ) S d t + \sigma _ { { s } } S d z

$$  

where $F$ is the forward exchange rate, $\sigma _ { F }$ is the volatility of $F$ (units of A per unit of B, and $\rho _ { _ { F S } }$ is the correlation between $F$ and $S$ . The market price of $d z$ -risk is $\rho _ { S P } \sigma _ { P } + \rho _ { F S } \sigma _ { F } .$  

# 28.11  

The forward value of a stock price, commodity price, or exchange rate is the delivery price in a forward contract that causes the value of the forward contract to be zero. A forward bond price is calculated in this way. However, a forward interest rate is the interest rate implied by the forward bond price.  

28.12  

$$

\begin{array} { l } { d \ln f = \left[ r + \displaystyle \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \left( \lambda _ { i } \sigma _ { f , i } - \sigma _ { f , i } ^ { 2 } / 2 \right) \right] d t + \displaystyle \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \sigma _ { f , i } d z _ { i } } \\ { d \ln g = \left[ r + \displaystyle \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \left( \lambda _ { i } \sigma _ { g , i } - \sigma _ { g , i } ^ { 2 } / 2 \right) \right] d t + \displaystyle \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \sigma _ { g , i } d z _ { i } } \end{array}

$$  

so that  

$$

d \ln { \frac { f } { g } } = d ( \ln f - \ln g ) = \left[ \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } ( \lambda _ { i } \sigma _ { f , i } - \lambda _ { i } \sigma _ { g , i } - \sigma _ { f , i } ^ { 2 } / 2 + \sigma _ { g , i } ^ { 2 } / 2 ) \right] d t + \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } ( \sigma _ { f , i } - \sigma _ { g , i } ) d \theta _ { i } .

$$  

Applying Ito’s lemma again  

$$

\displaystyle  \frac { \mathit { I }  { \frac { f } { g } } = \frac { f } { g } [ \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } ( \lambda _ { i } \sigma _ { f , i } - \lambda _ { i } \sigma _ { g , i } - \sigma _ { f , i } ^ { 2 } / 2 + \sigma _ { g , i } ^ { 2 } / 2 ) + ( \sigma _ { f , i } - \sigma _ { g , i } ) ^ { 2 } / 2 ] d t + \frac { f } { g } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } ( \sigma _ { f , i } - \sigma _ { g , i } \log ( \frac { \lambda _ { i } } { g } ) ) } .

$$  

When $\lambda _ { i } = \sigma _ { g , i }$ the coefficient of $d t$ is zero and $f / g$ is a martingale.  

28.13  

$$

\begin{array} { c } { d \ln h = … + \displaystyle \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \sigma _ { h , i } d z _ { i } } \\ { d \ln g = … + \displaystyle \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \sigma _ { g , i } d z _ { i } } \end{array}

$$  

so that  

$$

d \ln \frac { h } { g } = … + \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } ( \sigma _ { h , i } - \sigma _ { g , i } ) d z _ { i }

$$  

Applying Ito’s lemma again  

$$

d \frac { h } { g } = … + \frac { h } { g } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } ( \sigma _ { h , i } - \sigma _ { g , i } ) d z _ { i }

$$  

This proves the result.  

# 28.14  

If the expected value of a variable at time $t$ was expected to be greater (less) than its expected value at time zero, the expected value at time zero would be wrong. It would be too low (too high). A general result is that the expected value of a variable today is the expectation of its expected value at a future time.

(a) The no-arbitrage arguments in Chapter 5 show that  

$$

F ( t ) = \frac { f ( t ) } { P ( t , T ) }

$$  

(b) From Ito’s lemma:  

$$

d \ln P = ( \mu _ { P } - \sigma _ { P } ^ { 2 } / 2 ) d t + \sigma _ { P } d z

$$  

$$

d \ln f = ( \mu _ { f } - \sigma _ { f } ^ { 2 } / 2 ) d t + \sigma _ { f } d z

$$  

Therefore,  

$$

d \ln \frac { f } { P } = d ( \ln f - \ln P ) = ( \mu _ { f } - \sigma _ { f } ^ { 2 } / 2 - \mu _ { P } + \sigma _ { P } ^ { 2 } / 2 ) d t + ( \sigma _ { f } - \sigma _ { P } ) d z

$$  

so that  

$$

d \frac { f } { P } = ( \mu _ { f } - \mu _ { P } + \sigma _ { P } ^ { 2 } - \sigma _ { f } \sigma _ { P } ) \frac { f } { P } d t + ( \sigma _ { f } - \sigma _ { P } ) \frac { f } { P } d z

$$  

or  

$$

d F = ( \mu _ { _ { f } } - \mu _ { _ { P } } + \sigma _ { _ { P } } ^ { 2 } - \sigma _ { _ { f } } \sigma _ { _ { P } } ) F d t + ( \sigma _ { _ { f } } - \sigma _ { _ { P } } ) F d z

$$  

In a world defined by numeraire $P ( t , T )$ , $F$ has zero drift. The process for $F$ is  

$$

d F = ( \sigma _ { f } - \sigma _ { P } ) F d z

$$  

(c) In the traditional risk-neutral world, $\mu _ { f } = \mu _ { P } = r$ where $r$ is the short-term risk-free rate and  

$$

d F = ( \sigma _ { { } _ { P } } ^ { 2 } - \sigma _ { { } _ { f } } \sigma _ { { } _ { P } } ) F d t + ( \sigma _ { { } _ { f } } - \sigma _ { { } _ { P } } ) F d z

$$  

Note that the answers to parts (b) and (c) are consistent with the market price of risk being zero in (c) and $\sigma _ { { } _ { P } }$ in (b). When the market price of risk is $\sigma _ { P } , \mu _ { f } = r + \sigma _ { f } \sigma _ { P }$ and $\mu _ { _ { P } } = r + \sigma _ { _ { P } } ^ { 2 } .$  

(d) In a world defined by a numeraire equal to a bond maturing at time $T ^ { * }$ , $\mu _ { { \scriptscriptstyle P } } = r + \sigma _ { { \scriptscriptstyle P } } ^ { * } \sigma _ { { \scriptscriptstyle P } }$ and $\mu _ { \it f } = r + \sigma _ { \it P } ^ { \ast } \sigma _ { \it f }$ so that  

$$

d F = [ \sigma _ { P } ^ { 2 } - \sigma _ { f } \sigma _ { P } + \sigma _ { P } ^ { * } ( \sigma _ { f } - \sigma _ { P } ) ] F d t + ( \sigma _ { f } - \sigma _ { P } ) F d z

$$  

or  

$$

d F = ( \sigma _ { { f } } - \sigma _ { { P } } ) ( \sigma _ { { P } } ^ { * } - \sigma _ { { P } } ) F d t + ( \sigma _ { { f } } - \sigma _ { { P } } ) F d z

$$

(a) The futures price is a martingale in the traditional risk-neutral world.  

(b) The forward price for a contract maturing at time $T$ is a martingale is a world defined by numeraire $P ( t , T )$ .   
(c) Define $\sigma _ { { P } }$ as the volatility of $P ( t , T )$ and $\sigma _ { { \scriptscriptstyle F } }$ as the volatility of the forward price. The forward rate has zero drift in a world defined by numeraire $P ( t , T )$ . When we move from the traditional world to a world defined by numeraire $P ( t , T )$ , the volatility of the numeraire ratio is $\sigma _ { { } _ { P } }$ and the drift increases by $\rho _ { { P F } } \sigma _ { { P } } \sigma _ { { F } }$ where $\rho _ { { _ { P F } } }$ is the correlation between $P ( t , T )$ and the forward price. It follows that the drift of the forward price in the traditional risk neutral world is $- \rho _ { { } _ { P F } } \sigma _ { { } _ { P } } \sigma _ { { } _ { F } }$ . The drift of the futures price is zero in the traditional risk neutral world. It follows that the excess of the drift of the futures price over the forward price is $\rho _ { { _ P F } } \sigma _ { { _ P } } \sigma _ { { _ F } }$ .  

(d) $P$ is inversely correlated with interest rates. It follows that when the correlation between interest rates and $F$ is positive the futures price has a lower drift than the forward price. The futures and forward prices are the same at maturity. It follows that the futures price is above the forward price prior to maturity. This is consistent with Section 5.8. Similarly, when the correlation between interest rates and $F$ is negative, the future price is below the forward price prior to maturity.

A swap option (or swaption) is an option to enter into an interest rate swap at a certain time in the future with a certain fixed rate being used. An interest rate swap can be regarded as the exchange of a fixed-rate bond for a floating-rate bond. A swaption is therefore the option to exchange a fixed-rate bond for a floating-rate bond. The floating-rate bond will be worth its face value at the beginning of the life of the swap. The swaption is therefore an option on a fixed-rate bond with the strike price equal to the face value of the bond.

In this case, $F _ { 0 } = ( 1 2 5 - 1 0 ) e ^ { 0 . 1 \times 1 } = 1 2 7 . 0 9 , K = 1 1 0 , P ( 0 , T ) = e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 1 } , \sigma _ { _ B } =$ $\sigma _ { { } _ { B } } = 0 . 0 8$ , and $T = 1 . 0$  

$$

d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 1 2 7 . 0 9 / 1 1 0 ) + ( 0 . 0 8 ^ { 2 } / 2 ) } { 0 . 0 8 } } = 1 . 8 4 5 6

or $\$ 0.12$ .  

# 29.4  

When spot volatilities are used to value a cap, a different volatility is used to value each caplet. When flat volatilities are used, the same volatility is used to value each caplet within a given cap. Spot volatilities are a function of the maturity of the caplet. Flat volatilities are a function of the maturity of the cap.

# 29.6  

The implied volatility measures the standard deviation of the logarithm of the bond price at the maturity of the option divided by the square root of the time to maturity. In the case of a five year option on a ten year bond, the bond has five years left at option maturity. In the case of a nine year option on a ten year bond, it has one year left. The standard deviation of a one year bond price observed in nine years can be normally be expected to be considerably less than that of a five year bond price observed in five years. (See Figure 29.1.) We would therefore expect the price to be too high.  

# 29.7  

The present value of the principal in the four year bond is $1 0 0 e ^ { - 4 \times 0 . 1 } = 6 7 . 0 3 2$ . The present value of the coupons is, therefore, $1 0 2 - 6 7 . 0 3 2 = 3 4 . 9 6 8$ . This means that the forward price of the five-year bond is  

$$

( 1 0 5 - 3 4 . 9 6 8 ) e ^ { 4 \times 0 . 1 } = 1 0 4 . 4 7 5

$$  

The parameters in Black’s model are therefore $F _ { \scriptscriptstyle B } = 1 0 4 . 4 7 5 , K = 1 0 0 , r = 0 . 1 , T = $ , and $\sigma _ { { } _ { B } } = 0 . 0 2$ .

d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 0 2 { \sqrt { 4 } } = 1 . 0 7 4 4

The price of the European call is

$$  

or $\$ 3.19$ .  

# 29.8  

The option should be valued using Black’s model in equation (29.2) with the bond price volatility being  

$$

4 . 2 \times 0 . 0 7 \times 0 . 2 2 = 0 . 0 6 4 7

$$  

or $6 . 4 7 \%$ .  

# 29.9  

A 5-year zero-cost collar where the strike price of the cap equals the strike price of the floor is the same as an interest rate swap agreement to receive floating and pay a fixed rate equal to the strike price. The common strike price is the swap rate. Note that the swap is actually a forward swap that excludes the first exchange. (See Business Snapshot 29.1)  

# 29.10  

There are two way of expressing the put–call parity relationship for bond options. The first is in terms of bond prices:  

$$

c + I + K e ^ { - R T } = p + B _ { 0 }

$$  

where $c$ is the price of a European call option, $p$ is the price of the corresponding European put option, $I$ is the present value of the bond coupon payments during the life of the option, $K$ is the strike price, $T$ is the time to maturity, $B _ { 0 }$ is the bond price, and $R$ is the risk-free interest rate for a maturity equal to the life of the options. To prove this, we can consider two portfolios. The first consists of a European put option plus the bond; the second consists of the European call option, and an amount of cash equal to the present value of the coupons plus the present value of the strike price. Both can be seen to be worth the same at the maturity of the options.  

The second way of expressing the put–call parity relationship is  

$$

c + K e ^ { - R T } = p + F _ { _ B } e ^ { - R T }

$$  

where $F _ { _ B }$ is the forward bond price. This can also be proved by considering two portfolios.  

The first consists of a European put option plus a forward contract on the bond plus the present value of the forward price; the second consists of a European call option plus the present value of the strike price. Both can be seen to be worth the same at the maturity of the options.  

# 29.11  

The put–call parity relationship for European swap options is  

$$

c + V = p

$$  

where $c$ is the value of a call option to pay a fixed rate of $s _ { K }$ and receive floating, $p$ is the value of a put option to receive a fixed rate of $s _ { K }$ and pay floating, and $V$ is the value of the forward swap underlying the swap option where $s _ { K }$ is received and floating is paid. This can be proved by considering two portfolios. The first consists of the put option; the second consists of the call option and the swap. Suppose that the actual swap rate at the maturity of the options is greater than $s _ { K }$ . The call will be exercised and the put will not be exercised. Both portfolios are then worth zero. Suppose next that the actual swap rate at the maturity of the options is less than $s _ { K }$ . The put option is exercised and the call option is not exercised. Both portfolios are equivalent to a swap where $s _ { K }$ is received and floating is paid. In all states of the world, the two portfolios are worth the same at time $T$ . They must therefore be worth the same today. This proves the result.  

# 29.12  

Suppose that the cap and floor have the same strike price and the same time to maturity. The following put–call parity relationship must hold:  

$$

\mathrm { c a p } + \mathrm { s w a p } = \mathrm { f l o o r }

$$  

where the swap is an agreement to receive the cap rate and pay floating over the whole life of the cap/floor. If the implied Black volatilities for the cap equal those for the floor, the Black formulas show that this relationship holds. In other circumstances, it does not hold and there is an arbitrage opportunity.  

# 29.13  

Yes. For example, if a zero-coupon bond price at some future time is lognormal, there is some chance that the price will be above par. This, in turn, implies that the yield to maturity on the bond is negative.  

# 29.14  

In equation (29.10), $L = 1 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , \ : s _ { \scriptscriptstyle K } = 0 . 0 5 , \ : s _ { \scriptscriptstyle 0 } = 0 . 0 5 , \ : d _ { \scriptscriptstyle 1 } = 0 . 2 \sqrt { 4 } / 2 = 0 . 2 , \ : a$ $d _ { 2 } = - 0 . 2$ , and  

$$

A = { \frac { 1 } { 1 . 0 4 7 \ ^ { 5 } } } + { \frac { 1 } { 1 . 0 4 7 \ ^ { 6 } } } + { \frac { 1 } { 1 . 0 4 7 \ ^ { 7 } } } = 2 . 2 7 9 0

$$  

The value of the swap option (in millions of dollars) is  

$$

1 0 { \times } 2 . 2 7 9 0 [ 0 . 0 5 N ( 0 . 2 ) - 0 . 0 5 N ( - 0 . 2 ) ] = 0 . 1 8 1

$$  

This is also the value given by DerivaGem. (Note that the OIS rate is $4 . 5 9 3 \%$ with continuous compounding.)  

# 29.15  

The price of the bond at time $t$ is $e ^ { - R ( T - t ) }$ where $T$ is the time when the bond matures. Using Itô’s lemma, the volatility of the bond price is  

$$

\sigma \frac { \partial } { \partial R } e ^ { - R ( T - t ) } = - \sigma ( T - t ) e ^ { - R ( T - t ) }

$$  

This tends to zero as $t$ approaches $T$ .  

# 29.16  

The cash price of the bond is  

$$

4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 0 } + 4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 1 . 0 0 } + … + 4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 1 0 } + 1 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 1 0 } = 1 2 2 . 8 2

$$  

s there is no accrued interest, this is also the quoted price of the bond. The interest paid uring the life of the option has a present value of  

$$

4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } + 4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 1 } + 4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 1 . 5 } + 4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 2 } = 1 5 . 0 4

$$  

The forward price of the bond is therefore  

$$

( 1 2 2 . 8 2 - 1 5 . 0 4 ) e ^ { 0 . 0 5 \times 2 . 2 5 } = 1 2 0 . 6 1

$$  

The yield with semiannual compounding is $5 . 0 6 3 0 \%$ . The duration of the bond at option maturity is  

$$

\frac { 0 . 2 5 \times 4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 2 5 } + … + 7 . 7 5 \times 4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 7 . 7 5 } + 7 . 7 5 \times 1 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 7 . 7 5 } } { 4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 2 5 } + 4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 7 5 } + … + 4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 7 . 7 5 } + 1 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 7 . 7 5 } }

$$  

or 5.994. The modified duration is $5 . 9 9 4 / 1 . 0 2 5 3 1 5 = 5 . 8 4 6$ . The bond price volatility is therefore $5 . 8 4 6 \times 0 . 0 5 0 6 3 0 \times 0 . 2 = 0 . 0 5 9 2$ . We can therefore value the bond option using Black’s model with $F _ { B } = 1 2 0 . 6 1$ , $P ( 0 , 2 . 2 5 ) = e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 2 . 2 5 } = 0 . 8 9 3 6$ , $\sigma _ { B } = 5 . 9 2 \%$ , and $T = 2 . 2 5$ . When the strike price is the cash price $K = 1 1 5$ and the value of the option is 1.74. When the strike price is the quoted price $K = 1 1 7$ and the value of the option is 2.36. This is in agreement with DerivaGem.  

# 29.17  

Choose the Caps and Swap Options worksheet of DerivaGem and choose Cap/Floor as the Underlying Type and Black–European as the pricing model.. Enter the OIS rates as $6 . 5 \%$ . (It is only necessary to enter this for one maturity as the rate for all maturities will then automatically be assumed to be $6 . 5 \%$ ). The LIBOR forward rates are input as $6 . 7 \%$ . (Again this only needs to be done for one maturity.) Enter Semiannual for the Settlement Frequency, 100 for the Principal, 0 for the Start (Years), 5 for the End (Years), $8 \%$ for the Cap/Floor Rate, and $\$ 3$ for the Price. Check the Cap button. Check the Imply Volatility box and hit Calculate. The implied volatility is $3 1 . 5 1 \%$ . Then uncheck Implied Volatility, select Floor, check Imply Breakeven Rate. The floor rate that is calculated is $5 . 9 \%$ . This is the floor rate for which the floor is worth $\$ 3$ . A collar when the floor rate is $5 . 9 \%$ and the cap rate is $8 \%$ has zero cost.  

# 29.18  

We prove this result by considering two portfolios. The first consists of the swap option to receive $s _ { K }$ ; the second consists of the swap option to pay $s _ { K }$ and the forward swap. Suppose that the actual swap rate at the maturity of the options is greater than $s _ { K }$ . The swap option to pay $s _ { K }$ will be exercised and the swap option to receive $s _ { K }$ will not be exercised. Both portfolios are then worth zero since the swap option to pay $s _ { K }$ is neutralized by the forward swap. Suppose next that the actual swap rate at the maturity of the options is less than $s _ { K }$ . The swap option to receive $s _ { K }$ is exercised and the swap option to pay $s _ { K }$ is not exercised. Both portfolios are then equivalent to a swap where $s _ { K }$ is received and floating is paid. In all states of the world, the two portfolios are worth the same at time $T _ { 1 }$ . They must therefore be worth the same today. This proves the result. When $s _ { K }$ equals the current forward swap rate $f = 0$ and $V _ { 1 } = V _ { 2 }$ . A swap option to pay fixed is therefore worth the same as a similar swap option to receive fixed when the fixed rate in the swap option is the forward swap rate.  

# 29.19  

Choose the Caps and Swap Options worksheet of DerivaGem and choose Swap Option as the Underlying Type and Black–European as the pricing model. Enter 100 as the Principal, 1 as the Start (Years), 6 as the End (Years), $6 \%$ as the Swap Rate, and Semiannual as the Settlement Frequency. Enter $21 \%$ as the Volatility and check the Pay Fixed button. Do not check the Imply Breakeven Rate or Imply Volatility boxes. The value of the swap option is 3.75.  

# 29.20  

(a) To calculate flat volatilities from spot volatilities, we choose a strike rate and use the spot volatilities to calculate caplet prices. We then sum the caplet prices to obtain cap prices and imply flat volatilities from Black’s model. The answer is typically slightly dependent on the strike price chosen. This procedure ignores any volatility smile in cap pricing.   
(b) To calculate spot volatilities from flat volatilities, the first step is usually to interpolate between the flat volatilities so that we have a flat volatility for each caplet payment date. We choose a strike price and use the flat volatilities to calculate cap prices. By subtracting successive cap prices, we obtain caplet prices from which we can imply spot volatilities. The answer is typically slightly dependent on the strike price chosen. This procedure also ignores any volatility smile in caplet pricing.   
29.21   
The present value of the coupon payment is $3 5 e ^ { - 0 . 0 8 \times 0 . 2 5 } = 3 4 . 3 1$   
Equation (29.2) can therefore be used with $F _ { _ B } = ( 9 1 0 - 3 4 . 3 1 ) e ^ { 0 . 0 8 \times 8 / 1 2 } = 9 2 3 . 6 6$ , $r = 0 . 0 8$ ,   
$\sigma _ { { } _ { B } } = 0 . 1 0$ and $T = 0 . 6 6 6 7$ . When the strike price is a cash price, $K = 9 0 0$ and  

$$

d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 9 2 3 . 6 6 / 9 0 0 ) + 0 . 0 0 5 \times 0 . 6 6 6 7 } { 0 . 1 { \sqrt { 0 . 6 6 6 7 } } } } = 0 . 3 5 8 7

$$  

$$

d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 1 { \sqrt { 0 . 6 6 6 7 } } = 0 . 2 7 7 0

$$  

The option price is therefore  

$$

9 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 8 \times 0 . 6 6 6 7 } N ( - 0 . 2 7 7 0 ) - 8 7 5 . 6 9 N ( - 0 . 3 5 8 7 ) = 1 8 . 3 4

$$  

or $\$ 18.34$ .  

When the strike price is a quoted price, 5 months of accrued interest must be added to 900 to get the cash strike price. The cash strike price is $9 0 0 + 3 5 \times 0 . 8 3 3 3 = 9 2 9 . 1 7$ . In this case,  

$$

d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln ( 9 2 3 . 6 6 / 9 2 9 . 1 7 ) + 0 . 0 0 5 \times 0 . 6 6 6 7 } { 0 . 1 { \sqrt { 0 . 6 6 6 7 } } } } = - 0 . 0 3 1 9

$$  

$$

d _ { 2 } = d _ { 1 } - 0 . 1 \sqrt { 0 . 6 6 6 7 } = - 0 . 1 1 3 6

$$  

and the option price is  

$$

9 2 9 . 1 7 e ^ { - 0 . 0 8 \times 0 . 6 6 6 7 } N ( 0 . 1 1 3 6 ) - 8 7 5 . 6 9 N ( 0 . 0 3 1 9 ) = 3 1 . 2 2

$$  

or $\$ 31.22$ .  

# 29.22  

The payoff from the swaption is a series of five cash flows equal to $\operatorname* { m a x } [ 0 . 0 7 6 - R , 0 ]$ in millions of dollars where $R$ is the five-year swap rate in four years. The value of an annuity that provides $\$ 1$ per year at the end of years 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 is  

$$

\sum _ { i = 5 } ^ { 9 } e ^ { - 0 . 0 7 8 i } = 2 . 9 1 4

The value of the swaption in millions of dollars is therefore,

The value of the swaption is  

$$

$$  

or $\$ 39,273$ . This is the same answer as that given by DerivaGem.  

# 29.23  

Use the Caps and Swap Options worksheet of DerivaGem. To set the OIS zero curve as flat at $5 . 8 \%$ with continuous compounding, you need only enter $5 . 8 \%$ for one maturity. Similarly, you only need to enter the LIBOR forward rate as $6 \%$ for one maturity. To value the cap, select Cap/Floor as the Underlying Type, select Black–European as the pricing model, enter Quarterly for the Settlement Frequency, 100 for the Principal, 0 for the Start (Years), 5 for the End (Years), $7 \%$ for the Cap/Floor Rate, and $20 \%$ for the Volatility. Check the Cap button. Do not check the Imply Breakeven Rate, and Imply Volatility boxes. Clicking on Calculate gives the value of the cap as 1.514. To value the floor change the Cap/Floor Rate to $5 \%$ and check the Floor button rather than the Cap button. Clicking on Calculate gives the  

value as 1.116. The collar is a long position in the cap and a short position in the floor. The value of the collar is therefore,  

$$

1 . 5 1 4 - 1 . 1 1 6 = 0 . 3 9 8

$$  

# 29.24  

Choose the Cap and Swaptions  worksheet of DerivaGem, choose Swap Option as the Underlying Type, and Black–European as the pricing model. Enter 100 as the Principal, 2 as the Start (Years), 7 as the End (Years), $6 \%$ as the Swap Rate, and Semiannual as the Settlement Frequency. Enter the zero curve information and enter a forward rate curve that is flat at $7 \%$ . Enter $1 5 \%$ as the Volatility and check the Pay Fixed button. Do not check the Imply Breakeven Rate and Imply Volatility boxes. The value of the swaption is 4.384. For a company that expects to borrow at LIBOR plus 50 basis points in two years and then enter into a swap to convert to five-year fixed-rate borrowings, the swaption guarantees that its effective fixed rate will not be more than $6 . 5 \%$ . The swaption is the same as an option to sell a five-year $6 \%$ coupon bond for par in two years.  

# CHAPTER 30 Convexity, Timing, and Quanto Adjustments  

# Practice Questions  

# 30.1  

Suppose first that the correlation between the underlying asset price and interest rates is negative and we have a long forward contract. When interest rates increase, there will be a tendency for the asset price to decrease. The increase in interest rates means that an investor would like a positive payoff to be early and a negative one to be late. The negative correlation means that a negative payoff is more likely.  

When interest rates decrease, there will be a tendency for the asset price to increase. The decrease in interest rates means that an investor would like a positive payoff to be late and a negative one to be early. The negative correlation means that a positive payoff is more likely.  

This argument shows that a negative correlation works in the investor’s favor. Similarly, a positive correlation works against the investor’s interests.  

# 30.2  

(a) A convexity adjustment is necessary for the swap rate.   
(b) No convexity or timing adjustments are necessary.  

# 30.3  

There are two differences. The discounting is done over a 1.0-year period instead of over a 1.25-year period. Also a convexity adjustment to the forward rate is necessary. From equation (30.2), the convexity adjustment is:  

$$

{ \frac { 0 . 0 7 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 2 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 2 5 \times 1 } { 1 + 0 . 2 5 \times 0 . 0 7 } } = 0 . 0 0 0 0 5

$$  

or about half a basis point.  

In the formula for the caplet, we set $F _ { _ k } = 0 . 0 7 0 0 5$ instead of 0 07 . This means that $d _ { \scriptscriptstyle 1 } = - 0 . 5 6 4 2$ and $d _ { 2 } = - 0 . 7 6 4 2$ . The caplet price becomes  

$$

0 . 2 5 \times 1 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 5 \times 1 . 0 } [ 0 . 0 7 0 0 5 N ( - 0 . 5 6 4 2 ) - 0 . 0 8 N ( - 0 . 7 6 4 2 ) ] = 0 . 0 5 3 1

$$  

# 30.4  

The convexity adjustment discussed in Section 30.1 leads to the instrument being worth an amount slightly different from zero. Define $G ( y )$ as the value as seen in five years of a two-year bond with a coupon of $10 \%$ as a function of its yield.  

$$

G ( y ) = \frac { 0 . 1 } { 1 + y } + \frac { 1 . 1 } { \left( 1 + y \right) ^ { 2 } }

$$  

$$

G ^ { \prime } ( y ) = - \frac { 0 . 1 } { \left( 1 + y \right) ^ { 2 } } - \frac { 2 . 2 } { \left( 1 + y \right) ^ { 3 } }

$$  

$$

G ^ { \prime \prime } ( y ) = \frac { 0 . 2 } { { ( 1 + y ) } ^ { 3 } } + \frac { 6 . 6 } { { ( 1 + y ) } ^ { 4 } }

$$  

It follows that $G ^ { \prime } ( 0 . 1 ) = - 1 . 7 3 5 5$ and $G ^ { \prime \prime } ( 0 . 1 ) = 4 . 6 5 8 2$ and the convexity adjustment that must be made for the two-year swap- rate is  

$$

0 . 5 \times 0 . 1 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 2 ^ { 2 } \times 5 \times \frac { 4 . 6 5 8 2 } { 1 . 7 3 5 5 } = 0 . 0 0 2 6 8

$$  

We can therefore value the instrument on the assumption that the swap rate will be $1 0 . 2 6 8 \%$ in five years. The value of the instrument is  

$$

\frac { 0 . 2 6 8 } { 1 . 1 ^ { 5 } } = 0 . 1 6 7

$$  

or $\$ 0.167$ .  

# 30.5  

In this case, we have to make a timing adjustment as well as a convexity adjustment to the forward swap rate. For (a), equation (30.4) shows that the timing adjustment involves multiplying the swap rate by  

$$

\exp \biggl [ - \frac { 0 . 8 \times 0 . 2 0 \times 0 . 2 0 \times 0 . 1 \times 5 } { 1 + 0 . 1 } \biggr ] = 0 . 9 8 5 6

$$  

so that it becomes $1 0 . 2 6 8 \times 0 . 9 8 5 6 = 1 0 . 1 2 0$ . The value of the instrument is  

$$

\frac { 0 . 1 2 0 } { 1 . 1 ^ { 6 } } = 0 . 0 6 8

$$  

or $\$ 0.068$ .  

For (b), equation (30.4) shows that the timing adjustment involves multiplying the swap rate by  

$$

\exp \left[ - \frac { 0 . 9 5 \times 0 . 2 \times 0 . 2 \times 0 . 1 \times 2 \times 5 } { 1 + 0 . 1 } \right] = 0 . 9 6 6 0

$$  

so that it becomes $1 0 . 2 6 8 \times 0 . 9 6 6 = 9 . 9 1 9$ . The value of the instrument is now  

$$
- { \frac { 0 . 0 8 1 } { 1 . 1 ^ { 7 } } } = - 0 . 0 4 2
$$  

or $- \$ 042$ .  

30.6  

(a) The process for $y$ is  

$$

d y = \alpha y d t + \sigma _ { y } y d z

$$  

The forward bond price is $G ( y )$ . From Itô’s lemma, its process is  

$$

d [ G ( y ) ] = [ G ^ { \prime } ( y ) \alpha y + \frac { 1 } { 2 } G ^ { \prime \prime } ( y ) \sigma _ { y } ^ { 2 } y ^ { 2 } ] d t + G ^ { \prime } ( y ) \sigma _ { y } y d z

$$  

(b) Since the expected growth rate of $G ( y )$ is zero  

$$

G ^ { \prime } ( y ) \alpha y + \frac { 1 } { 2 } G ^ { \prime \prime } ( y ) \sigma _ { y } ^ { 2 } y ^ { 2 } = 0

$$  

or  

$$

\alpha = - \frac { 1 } { 2 } \frac { G ^ { \prime \prime } ( y ) } { G ^ { \prime } ( y ) } \sigma _ { y } ^ { 2 } y

$$  

(c)   Assuming as an approximation that $y$ always equals its initial value of $y _ { 0 }$ , this  

shows that the growth rate of $y$ is  

$$
- \frac { 1 } { 2 } \frac { G ^ { \prime \prime } ( y _ { 0 } ) } { G ^ { \prime } ( y _ { 0 } ) } \sigma _ { y } ^ { 2 } y _ { 0 }
$$  

The variable $y$ starts at $y _ { 0 }$ and ends as $y _ { T }$ . The convexity adjustment to $y _ { 0 }$ when we are calculating the expected value of $y _ { T }$ in a world that is defined by a numeraire equal to a zero-coupon bond maturing at time $T$ is approximately $y _ { 0 } T$ times this or  

$$
- \frac { 1 } { 2 } \frac { G ^ { \prime \prime } ( y _ { 0 } ) } { G ^ { \prime } ( y _ { 0 } ) } \sigma _ { y } ^ { 2 } y _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } T
$$  

This is consistent with equation (30.1).  

# 30.7  

(a) In the traditional risk-neutral world, the process followed by $S$ is  

$$

d S = ( r - q ) S d t + \sigma _ { S } S d z

$$  

where $r$ is the instantaneous risk-free rate. The market price of $d z$ -risk is zero.  

(b) In the traditional risk-neutral world for currency $\mathbf { B }$ , the process is $d S = ( r - q + \rho _ { \varrho S } \sigma _ { s } \sigma _ { \varrho } ) S d t + \sigma _ { s } S d z$ where $\boldsymbol { \mathcal { Q } }$ is the exchange rate (units of A per unit of B), $\sigma _ { \it Q }$ is the volatility of $\boldsymbol { \mathcal { Q } }$ and $\rho _ { \varrho s }$ is the coefficient of correlation between $\boldsymbol { \mathcal { Q } }$ and $S$ . The market price of $d z$ - risk is QSQ .  

(c)  In a world that is defined by a numeraire equal to a zero-coupon bond in currency A maturing at time $T _ { \mathbf { \delta } }$ ,  

$$

d S = ( r - q + \sigma _ { S } \sigma _ { P } ) S d t + \sigma _ { S } S d z

$$  

where $\sigma _ { { } _ { P } }$ is the bond price volatility. The market price of $d z$ -risk is $\sigma _ { { } _ { P } }$  

(d) In a world that is defined by a numeraire equal to a zero-coupon bond in currency B maturing at time $T _ { \mathbf { \delta } }$ ,  

$$

d S = ( r - q + \sigma _ { s } \sigma _ { P } + \rho _ { F S } \sigma _ { S } \sigma _ { F } ) S d t + \sigma _ { s } S d z

$$  

where $F$ is the forward exchange rate, $\sigma _ { F }$ is the volatility of $F$ (units of A per unit of B, and $\rho _ { \scriptscriptstyle { F S } }$ is the correlation between $F$ and $S$ . The market price of $d z$ -risk is $\sigma _ { P } + \rho _ { _ { F S } } \sigma _ { _ { F } } .$  

30.8  

Define:  

$P ( t , T )$ : Price in yen at time $t$ of a bond paying 1 yen at time $T$   
$E _ { T } ( . )$ :   Expectation in world that is defined by numeraire $P ( t , T )$   
$F$ : Dollar forward price of gold for a contract maturing at time $T$   
$F _ { 0 }$ : Value of $F$ at time zero   
$\sigma _ { F }$ : Volatility of $F$   
$G$ : Forward exchange rate (dollars per yen)   
$\sigma _ { G }$ : Volatility of $G$   
We assume that $S _ { T }$ is lognormal. We can work in a world that is defined by numeraire   
$P ( t , T )$ to get the value of the call as  

$$

P ( 0 , T ) [ E _ { T } ( S _ { T } ) N ( d _ { 1 } ) - N ( d _ { 2 } ) ]

$$  

where  

$$

d _ { 1 } = { \frac { \ln [ E _ { { T } } ( S _ { { T } } ) / K ] + \sigma _ { { F } } ^ { 2 } T / 2 } { \sigma _ { { F } } \sqrt { T } } }

$$  

$$

d _ { 2 } = { \frac { \ln [ E _ { T } ( S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } ) / K ] - \sigma _ { _ F } ^ { 2 } T / 2 } { \sigma _ { _ F } \sqrt { T } } }

$$  

The expected gold price in a world that is defined by a numeraire equal to a zero-coupon dollar bond maturing at time $T$ is $F _ { 0 }$ . It follows from equation (30.6) that  

$$

E _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } ( S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } ) = F _ { 0 } ( 1 + \rho \sigma _ { \scriptscriptstyle F } \sigma _ { \scriptscriptstyle G } T )

$$  

Hence the option price, measured in yen, is  

$$

P ( 0 , T ) [ F _ { 0 } ( 1 + \rho \sigma _ { F } \sigma _ { G } T ) N ( d _ { 1 } ) - K N ( d _ { 2 } ) ]

$$  

where  

$$

d _ { 1 } = \frac { \ln [ F _ { 0 } ( 1 + \rho \sigma _ { F } \sigma _ { G } T ) / K ] + \sigma _ { F } ^ { 2 } T / 2 } { \sigma _ { F } \sqrt { T } }

$$  

$$

d _ { 2 } = \frac { \ln [ F _ { 0 } ( 1 + \rho \sigma _ { F } \sigma _ { G } T ) / K ] - \sigma _ { F } ^ { 2 } T / 2 } { \sigma _ { F } \sqrt { T } }

$$  

# 30.9  

(a) The value of the option can be calculated by setting $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 4 0 0$ , $K = 4 0 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 6$ , $\scriptstyle q = 0 . 0 3$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2$ , and $T = 2$ . With 100 time steps, the value (in Canadian dollars) is 52.92.  

(b) The growth rate of the index using the CDN numeraire is 006  003 or $3 \%$ . When we switch to the USD numeraire, we increase the growth rate of the index by $0 . 4 \times 0 . 2 \times 0 . 0 6$ or $0 . 4 8 \%$ per year to $3 . 4 8 \%$ . The option can therefore be calculated using DerivaGem with $S _ { \mathrm { 0 } } = 4 0 0$ , $K = 4 0 0$ , $r = 0 . 0 4$ , $q = 0 . 0 4 - 0 . 0 3 4 8 = 0 . 0 0 5 2$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2$ , and $T = 2$ . With 100 time steps, DerivaGem gives the value as 57.51.  

# 30.10  

(a) We require the expected value of the Nikkei index in a dollar risk-neutral world. In a yen risk-neutral world, the expected value of the index is $2 0 , 0 0 0 e ^ { ( 0 . 0 2 - 0 . 0 1 ) \times 2 } = 2 0 , 4 0 4 . 0 3$ . In a dollar risk-neutral world, the analysis in Section 30.3 shows that this becomes  

$$

2 0 , 4 0 4 . 0 3 e ^ { 0 . 3 \times 0 . 2 0 \times 0 . 1 2 \times 2 } = 2 0 , 6 9 9 . 9 7

$$  

The value of the instrument is therefore,  

$$

2 0 , 6 9 9 . 9 7 e ^ { - 0 . 0 4 \times 2 } = 1 9 , 1 0 8 . 4 8

$$  

(b) An amount $S Q$ yen is invested in the Nikkei. Its value in yen changes to  

$$

S Q { \Bigg ( } 1 + { \frac { \Delta S } { S } } { \Bigg ) }

$$  

In dollars this is worth  

$$

S Q \frac { 1 + \Delta S / S } { Q + \Delta Q }

$$  

where $\Delta Q$ is the increase in $\boldsymbol { Q }$ . When terms of order two and higher are ignored, the dollar value becomes  

$$

S ( 1 + \Delta S / S - \Delta Q / Q )

$$  

The gain on the Nikkei position is therefore $\Delta S - S \Delta Q / Q$ When $S Q$ yen are shorted the gain in dollars is  

$$

S Q { \left( \frac { 1 } { Q } - \frac { 1 } { Q + \Delta Q } \right) }

$$  

This equals $S \Delta Q / Q$ when terms of order two and higher are ignored. The gain on the whole position is therefore $\Delta S$ as required.  

(c)  In this case, the investor invests $\$ 20,000$ in the Nikkei. The investor converts the funds to yen and buys 100 times the index. The index rises to 20,050 so that the investment becomes worth 2,005,000 yen or  

$$

\frac { 2 , 0 0 5 , 0 0 0 } { 9 9 . 7 } = 2 0 , 1 1 0 . 3 3

$$  

dollars. The investor therefore gains $\$ 1233$ . The investor also shorts 2,000,000 yen. The value of the yen changes from $\$ 0100$ to $\$ 0.01003$ . The investor therefore loses $0 . 0 0 0 0 3 \times 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 = 6 0$ dollars on the short position. The net gain is 50.33 dollars. This is close to the required gain of $\$ 50$ .  

(d) Suppose that the value of the instrument is $V$ . When the index changes by $\Delta S$ yen the value of the instrument changes by  

$$

\frac { \hat { \sigma } V } { \hat { \sigma } S } \Delta S

$$  

dollars. We can calculate ${ \partial V } / { \partial S }$ . Part (b) of this question shows how to manufacture an instrument that changes by $\Delta S$ dollars. This enables us to delta-hedge our exposure to the index.  

# 30.11  

To calculate the convexity adjustment for the five-year rate, define the price of a five year bond, as a function of its yield as  

$$

G ( y ) = e ^ { - 5 y }

$$  

$$

G ^ { \prime } ( y ) = - 5 e ^ { - 5 y }

$$  

$$

G ^ { \prime \prime } ( y ) = 2 5 e ^ { - 5 y }

$$  

The convexity adjustment is  

$$

0 . 5 \times 0 . 0 8 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 2 5 ^ { 2 } \times 4 \times 5 = 0 . 0 0 4

$$  

Similarly, for the two year rate the convexity adjustment is  

$$

0 . 5 \times 0 . 0 8 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 2 5 ^ { 2 } \times 4 \times 2 = 0 . 0 0 1 6

$$  

We can therefore value the derivative by assuming that the five year rate is $8 . 4 \%$ and the two-year rate is $8 . 1 6 \%$ . The value of the derivative is  

$$

0 . 2 4 e ^ { - 0 . 0 8 \times 4 } = 0 . 1 7 4

$$  

If the payoff occurs in five years rather than four years, it is necessary to make a timing adjustment. From equation (30.4) this involves multiplying the forward rate by  

$$

\exp \left[ - { \frac { 1 \times 0 . 2 5 \times 0 . 2 5 \times 0 . 0 8 \times 4 \times 1 } { 1 . 0 8 } } \right] = 0 . 9 8 1 6 5

$$  

The value of the derivative is  

$$

0 . 2 4 { \times } 0 . 9 8 1 6 5 { \mathrm { e } } ^ { - 0 . 0 8 { \times } 5 } { = } 0 . 1 5 8 .

$$  

30.12  

(a) In this case, we must make a convexity adjustment to the forward swap rate. Define  

$$

G ( y ) = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 6 } \frac { 4 } { ( 1 + y \ : / \ : 2 ) ^ { i } } + \frac { 1 0 0 } { ( 1 + y \ : / \ : 2 ) ^ { 6 } }

$$  

so that  

$$

G ^ { \prime } ( y ) = - \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 6 } \frac { 2 i } { \left( 1 + y / 2 \right) ^ { i + 1 } } + \frac { 3 0 0 } { \left( 1 + y / 2 \right) ^ { 7 } }

$$  

$$

G ^ { \prime \prime } ( y ) = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 6 } \frac { i ( i + 1 ) } { \left( 1 + y \ : / \ : 2 \right) ^ { i + 2 } } + \frac { 1 0 5 0 } { \left( 1 + y \ : / \ : 2 \right) ^ { 8 } }

$$  

$G ^ { \prime } ( 0 . 0 8 ) = - 2 6 2 . 1 1$ and $G ^ { \prime \prime } ( 0 . 0 8 ) = 8 5 3 . 2 9$ so that the convexity adjustment is  

$$

{ \frac { 1 } { 2 } } \times 0 . 0 8 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 1 8 ^ { 2 } \times 1 0 \times { \frac { 8 5 3 . 2 9 } { 2 6 2 . 1 1 } } = 0 . 0 0 3 3 8

$$  

The adjusted forward swap rate is $0 . 0 8 + 0 . 0 0 3 3 8 = 0 . 0 8 3 3 8$ and the value of the derivative in millions of dollars is  

$$

\frac { 0 . 0 8 3 3 8 \times 1 0 0 } { 1 . 0 3 ^ { 2 0 } } = 4 . 6 1 7

$$  

(b) When the swap rate is applied to a yen principal, we must make a quanto adjustment in addition to the convexity adjustment. From Section 30.3, this involves multiplying the forward swap rate by $e ^ { - 0 . 2 5 \times 0 . 1 2 \times 0 . 1 8 \times 1 0 } = 0 . 9 4 7 4$ . (Note that the correlation is the correlation between the dollar per yen exchange rate and the swap rate. It is therefore $- 0 . 2 5$ rather than $+ 0 . 2 5$ .) The value of the derivative in millions of yen is  

$$

\frac { 0 . 0 8 3 3 8 \times 0 . 9 4 7 4 \times 1 0 0 } { 1 . 0 1 ^ { 2 0 } } { = } 6 . 4 7 4

$$  

# CHAPTER 31 Equilibrium Models of the Short Rate  

# Practice Questions  

# 31.1  

In Vasicek’s model, it stays at $0 . 0 1 \sqrt { \Delta t }$ .  In the Rendleman and Bartter model, the coefficient of $d z$ is proportional to the level of the short rate. When the short rate increases from $4 \%$ to $8 \%$ , the standard deviation in time $\Delta t$ increases to $0 . 0 2 \sqrt { \Delta t }$ .  In the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model, the coefficient of $\Delta t$ is proportional to the square root of the short rate. When the short rate increases from $4 \%$ to $8 \%$ , the standard deviation  in time $\Delta t$ increases to $0 . 0 1 4 1 4 \sqrt { \Delta t }$ .  

# 31.2.  

If the price of a traded security followed a mean-reverting or path-dependent process, there would be market inefficiency. The short-term interest rate is not the price of a traded security. In other words, we cannot trade something whose price is always the short-term interest rate. There is therefore no market inefficiency when the short-term interest rate follows a meanreverting or path-dependent process. We can trade bonds and other instruments whose prices do depend on the short rate. The prices of these instruments do not follow mean-reverting or path-dependent processes.  

# 31.3  

In a one-factor model, there is one source of uncertainty driving all rates. This usually means that in any short period of time all rates move in the same direction (but not necessarily by the same amount). In a two-factor model, there are two sources of uncertainty driving all rates. The first source of uncertainty usually gives rise to a roughly parallel shift in rates. The second gives rise to a twist where long and short rates moves in opposite directions.

The risk-neutral process for a zero-coupon bond with a current maturity of 4 years is  

$$

d P ( t , 4 ) = r P ( t , 4 ) d t - 0 . 0 7 \sqrt { r } B ( t , 4 ) P ( t , 4 ) d z

$$  

where  

$$

B ( t , 4 ) = \frac { 2 ( e ^ { ( 4 - t ) \gamma } - 1 ) } { ( \gamma + 0 . 1 ) ( e ^ { ( 4 - t ) \gamma } - 1 ) + 2 \gamma }

$$  

with  

$$

\gamma = \sqrt { 0 . 1 ^ { 2 } + 2 \times 0 . 0 7 ^ { 2 } } = 0 . 1 4 0 7

$$  

In the real world, this becomes  

$$

d P ( t , 4 ) = \left[ 1 + 0 . 0 7 B ( t , 4 ) \right] r P ( t , 4 ) d t - 0 . 0 7 \sqrt { r } B ( t , 4 ) P ( t , 4 ) d z

$$  

# 31.6  

The risk-neutral process for the short rate is   
$d r = a ( b - r ) d t + \sigma d z$   
The real world process is  

$$

d r = [ a ( b - r ) + ( \lambda _ { 1 } + \lambda _ { 2 } r ) \sigma ] d t + \sigma d z

$$  

or  

$$

d r = [ ( a b + \lambda _ { 1 } \sigma ) - r ( a - \lambda _ { 2 } \sigma ) ] d t + \sigma d z

$$  

or  

$$

d r = \left[ ( a - \lambda _ { 2 } \sigma ) \left( \frac { a b + \lambda _ { 1 } \sigma } { a - \lambda _ { 2 } \sigma } - r \right) \right] d t + \sigma d z

$$  

This shows that the reversion rate is $a ^ { - } \lambda _ { 2 } \sigma$ and the reversion level is $\frac { a b + \lambda _ { 1 } \sigma } { a - \lambda _ { 2 } \sigma }$  

# 31.7  

The change $r _ { i } - r _ { i - 1 }$ is normally distributed with mean $a ( b ^ { * } - r _ { i - 1 } )$ and variance $\mathsf { o } ^ { 2 } \Delta t .$ The probability density of the observation is  

$$

\frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 \pi \sigma ^ { 2 } \Delta t } } \exp \left( \frac { r _ { i } - r _ { i - 1 } - a ( b ^ { \bullet } - r _ { i - 1 } ) } { 2 \sigma ^ { 2 } \Delta t } \right)

$$  

We wish to maximize  

$$

\prod _ { i = 1 } ^ { m } \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 \pi \sigma ^ { 2 } \Delta t } } \exp \left( \frac { r _ { i } - r _ { i - 1 } - a ( b ^ { \bullet } - r _ { i - 1 } ) } { 2 \sigma ^ { 2 } \Delta t } \right)

$$  

Taking logarithms, this is the same as maximizing  

$$

\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { m } \left( - \ln ( \sigma ^ { 2 } \Delta t ) - \frac { \left[ { r _ { i } - r _ { i - 1 } - a ( b ^ { \bullet } - r _ { i - 1 } ) \Delta t } \right] ^ { 2 } } { \sigma ^ { 2 } \Delta t } \right)

$$  

31.8 The calculations are as follows:   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Time, Ti</td><td>Cash Flow, Ci</td><td>B(0,Ti)</td><td>A(0,Ti)</td><td>P(0,Ti)</td><td>Value of cash flow</td><td>Weight</td><td>Weight ×B(0,Ti)</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>1.5</td><td>0.4841</td><td>0.9998</td><td>0.9950</td><td>1.4925</td><td>0.0144</td><td>0.0070</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.5</td><td>0.9377</td><td>0.9993</td><td>0.9899</td><td>1.4849</td><td>0.0143</td><td>0.0134</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>1.5</td><td>1.3628</td><td>0.9984</td><td>0.9849</td><td>1.4773</td><td>0.0142</td><td>0.0194</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>101.5</td><td>1.7611</td><td>0.9972</td><td>0.9798</td><td>99.4536</td><td>0.9571</td><td>1.6856</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>103.9083</td><td></td><td>1.7254</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The bond price is 103.9083. The alternative duration measure is 1.7254. The percentage decrease in the bond price of a 0.0005 increase in $r$ is estimated as $0 . 0 0 0 5 \times 1 . 7 5 2 4$ or $0 . 0 8 6 3 \%$ . so that the bond price decreases by an amount $0 . 0 0 0 8 6 3 \times 1 0 3 . 9 0 8 3 = 0 . 0 8 9 6 .$ The new bond price is 103.8187. This is also the bond price we get when we calculate the $P ( 0 , T _ { i } )$ from $r { = } 1 . 0 5 \%$ .  

31.9 In Vasicek’s model, $a = 0 . 1 , b = 0 . 1$ , and $\sigma = 0 . 0 2$ so that  

$$

B ( t , t + 1 0 ) = \frac { 1 } { 0 . 1 } ( 1 - e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 1 0 } ) = 6 . 3 2 1 2 1

$$  

$$

\mathscr { A } ( t , t + 1 0 ) = \exp \left[ \frac { ( 6 . 3 2 1 2 1 - 1 0 ) ( 0 . 1 ^ { 2 } \times 0 . 1 - 0 . 0 0 0 2 ) } { 0 . 0 1 } - \frac { 0 . 0 0 0 4 \times 6 . 3 2 1 2 1 ^ { 2 } } { 0 . 4 } \right]

$$  

$= 0 . 7 1 5 8 7$ The bond price is therefore $0 . 7 1 5 8 7 e ^ { - 6 . 3 2 1 2 1 \times 0 . 1 } = 0 . 3 8 0 4 6$  

In the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model, $a = 0 . 1$ , $b = 0 . 1$ and $\sigma { = } 0 . 0 2 / \sqrt { 0 . 1 } { = } 0 . 0 6 3 2$ . Also  

$$

\gamma = \sqrt { a ^ { 2 } + 2 \sigma ^ { 2 } } = 0 . 1 3 4 1 6

$$  

Define  

$$

\beta = ( \gamma + a ) ( e ^ { 1 0 \gamma } - 1 ) + 2 \gamma = 0 . 9 2 9 9 2

$$  

$$

B ( t , t + 1 0 ) = \frac { 2 ( e ^ { 1 0 \gamma } - 1 ) } { \beta } = 6 . 0 7 6 5 0

$$  

$$

A ( t , t + 1 0 ) = \left( \frac { 2 \gamma e ^ { 5 ( a + \gamma ) } } { \beta } \right) ^ { 2 a b / \sigma ^ { 2 } } = 0 . 6 9 7 4 6

$$  

The bond price is therefore $0 . 6 9 7 4 6 e ^ { - 6 . 0 7 6 5 0 \times 0 . 1 } = 0 . 3 7 9 8 6 .$ .  

# 31.10  

(a) The risk neutral process for $r$ has a drift rate which is $0 . 0 0 6 / r$ higher than the real world process. The volatility is $0 . 0 1 / r$ . This means that the market price of interest rate risk is $- 0 . 0 0 6 / 0 . 0 1$ or $- 0 . 6$ .  

(b) The expected return on the bond in the risk-neutral world is the risk free rate of $4 \%$ . The volatility is $0 . 0 1 \times B ( 0 , 5 )$ where  

$$

B ( 0 , 5 ) = { \frac { 1 - e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 5 } } { 0 . 1 } } = 3 . 9 3 5

$$  

i.e., the volatility is $3 . 9 3 5 \%$ .  

(c) The process followed by the bond price in a risk-neutral world is  

$$

d P = 0 . 0 4 P d t - 0 . 0 3 9 3 5 P d z

$$  

Note that the coefficient of $d z$ is negative because bond prices are negatively correlated with interest rates. When we move to the real world the return increases by the product of the market price of $d z$ risk and $- 0 . 0 3 9 3 5$ . The bond price process becomes:  

$$

d P = [ 0 . 0 4 + ( - 0 . 6 \times - 0 . 0 3 9 3 5 ) ] P d t - 0 . 0 3 9 3 5 P d z

$$  

or  

$$

d P = 0 . 0 6 3 6 1 P d t - 0 . 0 3 9 3 5 P d z

$$  

The expected return on the bond increases from $4 \%$ to $6 . 3 6 1 \%$ as we move from the risk-neutral world to the real world.  

31.11  

(a) $\frac { \hat { \sigma } ^ { 2 } P ( t , T ) } { \hat { \sigma } r ^ { 2 } } = B ( t , T ) ^ { 2 } A ( t , T ) e ^ { - B ( t , T ) r } = B ( t , T ) ^ { 2 } P ( t , T )$ (b) A corresponding definition for $\hat { C }$ is  

$$

\frac { 1 } { Q } \frac { \hat { \sigma } ^ { 2 } Q } { \hat { \sigma } r ^ { 2 } }

$$  

(c) When $Q { = } P ( t , T ) , \hat { C } = B ( t , T ) ^ { 2 }$ For a coupon-bearing bond $\hat { C }$ is a weighted average of the $\hat { C }$ ’s for the constituent zero-coupon bonds where weights are proportional to bond prices.  

(d)  

$$

\begin{array} { l } { \displaystyle \Delta P ( t , T ) = \frac { \hat { \partial } P ( t , T ) } { \hat { \partial } r } \Delta r + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \frac { \hat { \partial } ^ { 2 } P ( t , T ) } { \hat { \partial } r ^ { 2 } } \Delta r ^ { 2 } + \ldots } \\ { = - B ( t , T ) P ( t , T ) \Delta r + \frac { 1 } { 2 } B ( t , T ) ^ { 2 } P ( t , T ) \Delta r ^ { 2 } + \ldots } \end{array}

$$  

31.12 The risk-neutral process for the short rate is $d r = [ 0 . 1 5 ( 0 . 0 2 5 - r ) ] d t + 0 . 0 1 2 d z$  

The real world process for the short rate is  

$$

d r = [ 0 . 1 5 ( 0 . 0 2 5 - r ) - 0 . 2 0 \times 0 . 0 1 2 ] d t + 0 . 0 1 2 d z

$$  

or  

$$

d r = [ 0 . 1 5 ( 0 . 0 0 9 - r ) ] d t + 0 . 0 1 2 d z

$$  

The risk-neutral process for a zero-coupon bond with a current maturity of 3 years is  

$$

d P ( t , 3 ) = r P ( t , 3 ) d t - 0 . 0 1 2 B ( \mathrm { t } , 3 ) P ( t , 3 ) d z

$$  

where  

$$

B ( t , 3 ) = \frac { 1 - e ^ { - 0 . 1 5 ( 3 - t ) } } { 0 . 1 5 }

$$  

In the real world this becomes  

$$

d P ( t , 3 ) = [ r P ( t , 3 ) + 0 . 2 \times 0 . 0 1 2 B ( t , 3 ) P ( t , 3 ) ] d t - 0 . 0 1 2 B ( t , 3 ) P ( t , 3 ) d z

$$  

or  

$$

d P ( t , 3 ) = [ r + 0 . 0 0 2 4 B ( t , 3 ) ] P ( t , 3 ) d t - 0 . 0 1 2 B ( t , 3 ) P ( t , 3 ) d z

$$  

# 31.13  

The risk-neutral process for the short rate is  

$$

d r = a ( b - r ) d t + \sigma \sqrt { r } d z

$$  

The real world process is  

$$

d r = [ a ( b - r ) + ( \lambda _ { 1 } / \sqrt { r } + \lambda _ { 2 } \sqrt { r } ) \sigma \sqrt { r } ] d t + \sigma \sqrt { r } d z

$$  

or  

$$

d r = [ ( a b + \lambda _ { 1 } \sigma ) - r ( a - \lambda _ { 2 } \sigma ) ] d t + \sigma \sqrt { r } d z

$$  

or  

$$

d r = [ ( a - \lambda _ { 2 } \sigma ) \left( \frac { a b + \lambda _ { 1 } \sigma } { a - \lambda _ { 2 } \sigma } - r \right) ] d t + \sigma \sqrt { r } d z

$$  

This shows that the reversion rate is $a ^ { - } \lambda _ { 2 } \sigma$ and the reversion level is $\frac { a b + \lambda _ { 1 } \sigma } { a - \lambda _ { 2 } \sigma }$  

# 31.14  

The differential equation satisfied by the bond price $P ( t , T )$ is  

$$

\begin{array} { l } { \displaystyle { \frac { \partial f } { \partial t } + ( u - a r ) \frac { \partial f } { \partial r } - b u \frac { \partial f } { \partial u } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } f } { \partial r ^ { 2 } } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } f } { \partial u ^ { 2 } } + \sigma _ { 1 } \sigma _ { 2 } \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } f } { \partial r \partial u } = r f } } \\ { \displaystyle f = A ( t , T ) e ^ { - B ( t , T ) r - C ( t , T ) u } } \end{array}

$$  

satisfies this if  

$$

A _ { t } - A B _ { t } r - A C _ { t } u - ( u - a r ) A B + b u A C + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } B ^ { 2 } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } C ^ { 2 } + \sigma _ { 1 } \sigma _ { 2 } B C = r A

$$  

or if  

$$

\begin{array} { l } { { A _ { t } + \displaystyle \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } B ^ { 2 } + \displaystyle \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sigma _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } C ^ { 2 } + \sigma _ { 1 } \sigma _ { 2 } B C = 0 } } \\ { { B _ { t } - a B + 1 = 0 } } \\ { { C _ { t } + B - b C = 0 } } \end{array}

$$  

The equation  

$$

B _ { t } - a B + 1 = 0

$$  

is satisfied by  

$$

B ( t , T ) = \frac { 1 - e ^ { - a ( T - t ) } } { a }

$$  

The equation  

$$

\mathrm { C } _ { t } + \frac { 1 - e ^ { - a ( T - t ) } } { a } - b C = 0

$$  

is satified by  

$$

C ( t , T ) = { \frac { 1 } { a ( a - b ) } } e ^ { - a ( T - t ) } - { \frac { 1 } { b ( a - b ) } } e ^ { - b ( T - t ) } + { \frac { 1 } { a b } }

$$  

# 31.15  (Excel file)  

See Excel worksheet. Both approaches give $\scriptstyle a = 0 . 1 3 6$ , $b ^ { * } { = } 0 . 0 1 6 8$ , and $\scriptstyle \mathtt { \sigma - 0 . 0 1 1 9 }$ .  

# 31.16 (Excel file)  

In the case of the CIR model, the change $r _ { i } - r _ { i - 1 }$ is normally distributed with mean $a ( b - r _ { i - 1 } ) \Delta t$ and variance $\sigma ^ { 2 } r _ { i - 1 } \Delta t$ and the maximum likelihood function becomes  

$$

\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { m } \left( - \ln ( \sigma ^ { 2 } r _ { i - 1 } \Delta t ) - \frac { \left[ r _ { i } - r _ { i - 1 } - a ( b - r _ { i - 1 } ) \Delta t \right] ^ { 2 } } { \sigma ^ { 2 } r _ { i - 1 } \Delta t } \right)

$$  

The Excel worksheet shows that the best fit (real world)  parameters are $a ^ { * } = 0 . 2 0 1$ , ${ \sf b ^ { * } } { = } 0 . 0 2 5$ , and $\sigma = 0 . 0 7 7$ . The estimated real world process is therefore:  

$$

d r = 0 . 2 0 1 ( 0 . 0 2 5 - r ) + 0 . 0 7 7 \sqrt { r } d z

$$  

The short rate reverts to $2 . 5 \%$ with a $20 \%$ reversion rate. These parameters are not unreasonable and the likelihood is higher than for Vasicek’s model (see Problem 31.16). However, the market price of risk is estimated as $- 0 . 0 2 6 6 { \sqrt { r } }$ which, although it has the right sign is very small indicating very little difference between real world and risk neutral processes.  

# CHAPTER 32 No-Arbitrage Models of the Short Rate  

# Practice Questions  

# 32.1  

Equilibrium models usually start with assumptions about economic variables and derive the behavior of interest rates. The initial term structure is an output from the model. In a noarbitrage model, the initial term structure is an input. The behavior of interest rates in a noarbitrage model is designed to be consistent with the initial term structure.  

# 32.2  

No. The approach in Section 32.2 relies on the argument that, at any given time, all bond prices are moving in the same direction. This is not true when there is more than one factor.  

# 32.3  

Using the notation in the text, $s = 3$ , $T = 1$ , $L = 1 0 0$ , $K = 8 7$ , and  

$$

\sigma _ { { \scriptscriptstyle P } } = \frac { 0 . 0 1 5 } { 0 . 1 } ( 1 - e ^ { - 2 \times 0 . 1 } ) \sqrt { \frac { 1 - e ^ { - 2 \times 0 . 1 \times 1 } } { 2 \times 0 . 1 } } = 0 . 0 2 5 8 8 6

$$  

From equation (31.6), $P ( 0 , 1 ) = 0 . 9 4 9 8 8$ , $P ( 0 , 3 ) = 0 . 8 5 0 9 2$ , and $h = 1 . 1 4 2 7 7$ so that equation (31.20) gives the call price as call price is  

$$

1 0 0 \times 0 . 8 5 0 9 2 \times N ( 1 . 1 4 2 7 7 ) - 8 7 \times 0 . 9 4 9 8 8 \times N ( 1 . 1 1 6 8 8 ) = 2 . 5 9

$$  

or $\$ 2.59$ .  

# 32.4  

As mentioned in the text, equation (32.10) for a call option is essentially the same as Black’s model. By analogy with Black’s formulas corresponding expression for a put option is  

$$

K P ( 0 , T ) N ( - h + \sigma _ { _ P } ) - L P ( 0 , s ) N ( - h )

$$  

In this case, the put price is  

$$

8 7 \times 0 . 9 4 9 8 8 \times N ( - 1 . 1 1 6 8 8 ) - 1 0 0 \times 0 . 8 5 0 9 2 \times N ( - 1 . 1 4 2 7 7 ) = 0 . 1 4

$$  

Since the underlying bond pays no coupon, put–call parity states that the put price plus the bond price should equal the call price plus the present value of the strike price. The bond price is 85.09 and the present value of the strike price is $8 7 \times 0 . 9 4 9 8 8 = 8 2 . 6 4$ . Put–call parity is therefore satisfied:  

$$

8 2 . 6 4 + 2 . 5 9 = 8 5 . 0 9 + 0 . 1 4

$$  

# 32.5  

As explained in Section 32.2, the first stage is to calculate the value of $r$ at time 2.1 years which is such that the value of the bond at that time is 99. Denoting this value of $r$ by $r ^ { * }$ , we must solve  

$$

2 . 5 A ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 5 ) e ^ { - B ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 5 ) r ^ { \ast } } + 1 0 2 . 5 A ( 2 . 1 , 3 . 0 ) e ^ { - B ( 2 . 1 , 3 . 0 ) r ^ { \ast } } = 9 9 \

$$  

where the $A$ and $B$ functions are given by equations (31.7) and (31.8). In this case, $A ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 5 ) = 0 . 9 9 9 6 8 5$ , $A ( 2 . 1 , 3 . 0 ) = 0 . 9 9 8 4 3 2$ , $B ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 5 ) = 0 . 3 9 6 0 2 7$ , and $B ( 2 . 1 , 3 . 0 ) =$ 0.88005, and Solver shows that $r ^ { * } = 0 . 0 6 5 9 8 9$ . Since  

$$

2 . 5 A ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 5 ) e ^ { - B ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 5 ) \times r ^ { \ast } } = 2 . 4 3 4 7 4 5

$$  

and  

$$

1 0 2 . 5 A ( 2 . 1 , 3 . 0 ) e ^ { - B ( 2 . 1 , 3 . 0 ) \times r ^ { * } } = 9 6 . 5 6 5 3 5

$$  

the call option on the coupon-bearing bond can be decomposed into a call option with a strike price of 2.434745 on a bond that pays off 2.5 at time 2.5 years and a call option with a strike price of 96.56535 on a bond that pays off 102.5 at time 3.0 years.  

The options are valued using equation (32.10).  

For the first option, $L = 2 . 5$ , $K = 2 . 4 3 4 7 4 5$ , $T = 2 . 1$ , and $s = 2 . 5$ . Also, $\boldsymbol { A } ( \theta , T ) = 0 . 9 9 1 8 3 6 ,$ $B ( 0 , T ) = 1 . 9 9 3 5 1$ , $P ( 0 , T ) = 0 . 8 8 0 0 2 2$ while $\begin{array} { r } { A ( 0 , s ) = 0 . 9 8 8 6 0 4 } \end{array}$ , $B ( 0 , s ) = 2 . 3 5 0 0 6 2$ , and $P ( 0 , s ) = 0 . 8 5 8 5 8 9$ .  Furthermore, $\sigma _ { P } = 0 . 0 0 8 1 7 6$ and $h = 0 . 2 2 3 3 5 1$ . so that the option price is 0.009084.  

For the second option $L = 1 0 2 . 5$ , $K = 9 6 . 5 6 5 3 5$ , $T = 2 . 1$ , and $s = 3 . 0$ . Also, $\boldsymbol { A } ( \theta , T ) = 0 . 9 9 1 8 3 6 ,$ . $B ( 0 , T ) = 1 . 9 9 3 5 1$ , $P ( 0 , T ) = 0 . 8 8 0 0 2 2$ while $\mathit { A } ( 0 , s ) = 0 . 9 8 3 9 0 4$ , $B ( 0 , s ) = 2 . 7 8 5 8 4$ , and $P ( 0 , s ) = 0 . 8 3 2 4 5 4$ .  Furthermore $\sigma _ { P } = 0 . 0 1 8 1 6 8$ and $h = 0 . 2 3 3 3 4 3$ . so that the option price is 0.806105.  

The total value of the option is therefore $0 . 0 0 9 0 0 8 4 \substack { + 0 . 8 0 6 1 0 5 = 0 . 8 1 5 1 8 9 . }$  

32.6 Put–call parity shows that:  

$$

c + I + P V ( K ) = p + B _ { 0 }

$$  

or  

$$

p = c + P V ( K ) - ( B _ { 0 } - I )

$$  

where $c$ is the call price, $K$ is the strike price, $I$ is the present value of the coupons, and $B _ { 0 }$ is the bond price. In this case $c = 0 . 8 1 5 2$ $1 5 2 , P V ( K ) = 9 9 \times P ( 0 , 2 . 1 ) = 8 7 . 1 2 2 2 ,$ $B _ { 0 } - I = 2 . 5 \times P ( 0 , 2 . 5 ) + 1 0 2 . 5 \times P ( 0 , 3 ) = 8 7 . 4 7 3 0$ so that the put price is $0 . 8 1 5 2 + 8 7 . 1 2 2 2 - 8 7 . 4 7 3 0 = 0 . 4 6 4 4$  

# 32.7  

Using the notation in the text $P ( 0 , T ) = e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 1 } = 0 . 9 0 4 8$ and $P ( 0 , s ) = e ^ { - 0 . 1 \times 5 } = 0 . 6 0 6 5$ . Also

\sigma _ { { P } } = \frac { 0 . 0 1 } { 0 . 0 8 } ( 1 - e ^ { - 4 \times 0 . 0 8 } ) \sqrt { \frac { 1 - e ^ { - 2 \times 0 . 0 8 \times 1 } } { 2 \times 0 . 0 8 } } = 0 . 0 3 2 9

$$  

and $h = - 0 . 4 1 9 2$ so that the call price is  

$$

1 0 0 \times 0 . 6 0 6 5 N ( h ) - 6 8 \times 0 . 9 0 4 8 N ( h - \sigma _ { P } ) = 0 . 4 3 9

$$  

# 32.8  

This problem is similar to Problem 32.5. The difference is that the Hull–White model, which fits an initial term structure, is used instead of Vasicek’s model where the initial term structure is determined by the model.  

The yield curve is flat with a continuously compounded rate of $5 . 9 1 1 8 \%$ .  

As explained in Section 32.2, the first stage is to calculate the value of $r$ at time 2.1 years which is such that the value of the bond at that time is 99. Denoting this value of $r$ by $r ^ { * }$ , we must solve  

$$

2 . 5 A ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 5 ) e ^ { - B ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 5 ) r ^ { * } } + 1 0 2 . 5 A ( 2 . 1 , 3 . 0 ) e ^ { - B ( 2 . 1 , 3 . 0 ) r ^ { * } } = 9 9 \

$$  

where the $A$ and $B$ functions are given by equations (32.7) and (32.8). In this case, $1 , 2 . 5 ) = 0 . 9 9 9 7 3 2 , A ( 2 . 1 , 3 . 0 ) = 0 . 9 9 8 6 5 6 , \ B ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 5 ) = 0 . 3 9 6 0 2 7$ , and $B ( 2 . 1 , 3 . 0 ) = 0 . 8 8 0 0 5$ . and Solver shows that $r ^ { * } = 0 . 0 6 6 2 4 4$ . Since  

$$

2 . 5 A ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 5 ) e ^ { - B ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 5 ) \times r ^ { \ast } } = 2 . 4 3 4 6 1 4

$$  

and  

$$

1 0 2 . 5 A ( 2 . 1 , 3 . 0 ) e ^ { - B ( 2 . 1 , 3 . 0 ) \times r ^ { * } } = 9 6 . 5 6 5 3 9

$$  

the call option on the coupon-bearing bond can be decomposed into a call option with a strike price of 2.434614 on a bond that pays off 2.5 at time 2.5 years and a call option with a strike price of 96.56539 on a bond that pays off 102.5 at time 3.0 years.  

The options are valued using equation (32.10). For the first option, $L = 2 . 5$ , $K = 2 . 4 3 4 6 1 4$ , $T = 2 . 1$ , and $s = 2 . 5$ . Also, $P ( 0 , T ) = \exp ( - 0 . 0 5 9 1 1 8 \times 2 . 1 ) = 0 . 8 8 3 2 5$ and $P ( 0 , s ) = \exp ( - 0 . 0 5 9 1 1 8 \times 2 . 5 ) = 0 . 8 6 2 6 0 9$ . Furthermore, $\sigma _ { P } = 0 . 0 0 8 1 7 6$ and $h = 0 . 3 5 3 3 7 4$ . so that the option price is 0.010523. For the second option, $L = 1 0 2 . 5 , K = 9 6 . 5 6 5 3 9 , T = 2$ , and $s = 3 . 0$ . Also, $P ( 0 , T ) = \exp ( - 0 . 0 5 9 1 1 8 \times 2 . 1 ) = 0 . 8 8 3 2 5$ and $P ( 0 , s ) = \exp ( - 0 . 0 5 9 1 1 8 \times 3 . 0 ) = 0 . 8 3 7 4 8 4$ . Furthermore, $\sigma _ { P } = 0 . 0 1 8 1 6 8$ and $h = 0 . 3 6 3 3 6 6$ . so that the option price is 0.934074.  

The total value of the option is therefore $0 . 0 1 0 5 2 3 + 0 . 9 3 4 0 7 4 = 0 . 9 4 4 5 9 6 .$  

# 32.9  

The time step, $\Delta t$ , is 1 so that $\Delta r = 0 . 0 1 5 \sqrt { 3 } = 0 . 0 2 5 9 8$ . Also $j _ { \mathrm { m a x } } = 4$ showing that the branching method should change four steps from the center of the tree. With only three steps, we never reach the point where the branching changes. The tree is shown in Figure S32.1.

A two-year zero-coupon bond pays off $\$ 100$ at the ends of the final branches. At node B, it is worth $1 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 2 \times 1 } = 8 8 . 6 9$ . At node C, it is worth $1 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 1 0 \times 1 } = 9 0 . 4 8 \$ . At node D, it is worth $1 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 8 \times 1 } = 9 2 . 3 1$ . It follows that at node A, the bond is worth  

# 32.11  

A two-year zero-coupon bond pays off $\$ 100$ at time two years. At node B, it is worth $1 0 0 \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . { \dot { 0 } } 6 9 3 7 } = 9 3 . 3 0$ . At node C, it is worth $1 0 0 \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 5 2 0 5 } = 9 4 . 9 3 \$ . At node D, it is worth $1 0 0 \mathrm { e } ^ { - 0 . 0 3 4 7 3 } = 9 6 . 5 9$ . It follows that at node A, the bond is worth  

$$

( 9 3 . 3 0 \times 0 . 1 6 7 + 9 4 . 9 3 \times 0 . 6 6 6 + 9 6 . 5 9 \times 0 . 1 6 7 ) e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 8 2 \times 1 } = 9 1 . 3 7

$$  

or $\$ 91.37$ . Because $9 1 . 3 7 = 1 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 4 5 1 2 \times 2 }$ , the price of the two-year bond agrees with the initial term structure.  

# 32.12  

An 18-month zero-coupon bond pays off $\$ 100$ at the final nodes of the tree. At node E, it is worth $1 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 8 8 \times 0 . 5 } = 9 5 . 7 0$ . At node F, it is worth $1 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 6 4 8 \times 0 . 5 } = 9 6 . 8 1$ . At node G, it is worth $1 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 4 7 7 \times 0 . 5 } = 9 7 . 6 4$ . At node H, it is worth $1 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 5 1 \times 0 . 5 } = 9 8 . 2 6$ . At node I, it is worth $1 0 0 e ^ { 0 . 0 2 5 9 \times 0 . 5 } = 9 8 . 7 1$ . At node B, it is worth $( 0 . 1 1 8 \times 9 5 . 7 0 + 0 . 6 5 4 \times 9 6 . 8 1 + 0 . 2 2 8 \times 9 7 . 6 4 ) e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 6 4 \times 0 . 5 } = 9 4 . 1 7 \$  

Similarly, at nodes $\mathrm { ^ c }$ and $\mathrm { ~ D ~ }$ , it is worth 95.60 and 96.68. The value at node A is therefore $( 0 . 1 6 7 \times 9 4 . 1 7 + 0 . 6 6 6 \times 9 5 . 6 0 + 0 . 1 6 7 \times 9 6 . 6 8 ) e ^ { - 0 . 0 3 4 3 \times 0 . 5 } = 9 3 . 9 2$  

The 18-month zero rate is $0 . 0 8 - 0 . 0 5 e ^ { - 0 . 1 8 \times 1 . 5 } = 0 . 0 4 1 8$ . This gives the price of the 18-month zero-coupon bond as $1 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 4 1 8 \times 1 . 5 } = 9 3 . 9 2$ showing that the tree agrees with the initial term structure.  

# 32.13  

The calibration of a one-factor interest rate model involves determining its volatility parameters so that it matches the market prices of actively traded interest rate options as closely as possible.  

# 32.14  

From equation (32.6)  

$$

P ( t , t + \Delta t ) = A ( t , t + \Delta t ) e ^ { - r ( t ) B ( t , t + \Delta t ) }

$$  

Also  

$$

P ( t , t + \Delta t ) = e ^ { - R ( t ) \Delta t }

$$  

so that  

$$

e ^ { - R ( t ) \Delta t } = A ( t , t + \Delta t ) e ^ { - r ( t ) B ( t , t + \Delta t ) }

$$  

or  

$$

e ^ { - r ( t ) B ( t , T ) } = \frac { e ^ { - R ( t ) B ( t , T ) \Delta t / B ( t , t + \Delta t ) } } { A ( t , t + \Delta t ) ^ { B ( t , T ) / B ( t , t + \Delta t ) } }

$$  

Hence equation (31.15) is true with  

$$

\hat { B } ( t , T ) = \frac { B ( t , T ) \Delta t } { B ( t , t + \Delta t }

$$  

and  

$$

\hat { A } ( t , T ) = \frac { A ( t , T ) } { A ( t , t + \Delta t ) ^ { B ( t , T ) / B ( t , t + \Delta t ) } }

$$  

or  

$$

\ln \hat { \cal A } ( t , T ) = \ln A ( t , T ) - \frac { B ( t , T ) } { B ( t , t + \Delta t ) } \ln A ( t , t + \Delta t )

$$

Using 10 time steps:  

(a) The implied value of $\sigma$ is $1 . 1 2 \%$ .   
(b) The value of the American option is 0.595.   
(c) The implied value of $\sigma$ is $1 8 . 4 5 \%$ and the value of the American option is 0.595. The two models give the same answer providing they are both calibrated to the same European price.   
(d) We get a negative interest rate if there are 10 down moves. The probability of this is $0 . 1 6 6 6 7 \times 0 . 1 6 4 1 8 \times 0 . 1 6 1 7 2 \times 0 . 1 5 9 2 8 \times 0 . 1 5 6 8 7 \times 0 . 1 5 4 4 8 \times 0 . 1 5 2 1 2 \times 0 . 1 4 9 7 8 \times 0 . 1 2 2 2 \times 0 . 1 5 7 2 8$ $0 . 1 4 7 4 7 \times 0 . 1 4 5 1 8 = 8 . 3 { \times } 1 0 ^ { - 9 }$

With 100 time steps, the lognormal model gives prices of 5.585, 2.443, and 0.703 for strike prices of 95, 100, and 105. With 100 time steps, the normal model gives prices of 5.508, 2.522, and 0.895 for the three strike prices, respectively. The normal model gives a heavier left tail and a less heavy right tail than the lognormal model for interest rates. This translates into a less heavy left tail and a heavier right tail for bond prices. The arguments in Chapter 20 show that we expect the normal model to give higher option prices for high strike prices and lower option prices for low strike. This is indeed what we find.  

# 32.17 (a) The results are shown in Figure S32.3.

# CHAPTER 33 Modeling Forward Rates  

# Practice Questions  

# 33.1  

In a Markov model, the expected change and volatility of the short rate at time $t$ depend only on the value of the short rate at time $t$ . In a non-Markov model, they depend on the history of the short rate prior to time $t$ .  

# 33.2  

Equation (33.1) becomes  

$$

d P ( t , T ) = r ( t ) P ( t , T ) d t + \sum _ { k } \nu _ { k } ( t , T , \Omega _ { t } ) P ( t , T ) d z _ { k } ( t )

$$  

so that  

$$

d \ln [ P ( t , T _ { 1 } ) ] = \left[ r ( t ) - \sum _ { k } \frac { \nu _ { k } ( t , T _ { 1 } , \Omega _ { t } ) ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \right] d t + \sum _ { k } \nu _ { k } ( t , T _ { 1 } , \Omega _ { t } ) d z _ { k } ( t )

$$  

and  

$$

d \ln [ P ( t , T _ { 2 } ) ] = \left[ r ( t ) - \sum _ { k } \frac { \nu _ { k } ( t , T _ { 2 } , \Omega _ { t } ) ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \right] d t + \nu _ { k } ( t , T _ { 2 } , \Omega _ { t } ) d z _ { k } ( t )

$$  

From equation (33.2)  

$$

d f ( t , T _ { 1 } , T _ { 2 } ) = \frac { \sum _ { k } \left[ \nu _ { k } ( t , T _ { 2 } , \Omega _ { t } ) ^ { 2 } - \nu _ { k } ( t , T _ { 1 } , \Omega _ { t } ) ^ { 2 } \right] } { 2 ( T _ { 2 } - T _ { 1 } ) } d t + \sum _ { k } \frac { \nu _ { k } ( t , T _ { 1 } , \Omega _ { t } ) - \nu _ { k } ( t , T _ { 2 } , \Omega _ { t } ) } { T _ { 2 } - T _ { 1 } } d z _ { k } ( t )

$$  

Putting $T _ { \mathrm { l } } = T$ and $T _ { 2 } = T + \Delta t$ and taking limits as $\Delta t$ tends to zero, this becomes  

$$

d F ( t , T ) = { \sum _ { k } } \Biggl [ \nu _ { k } ( t , T , \Omega _ { t } ) \frac { \hat { c } \nu _ { k } ( t , T , \Omega _ { t } ) } { \hat { c } T } \Biggr ] d t - { \sum _ { k } } \Biggl [ \frac { \hat { c } \nu _ { k } ( t , T , \Omega _ { t } ) } { \hat { \sigma } T } \Biggr ] d z _ { k } ( t )

$$  

Using $\nu _ { { } _ { k } } ( t , t , \Omega _ { t } ) = 0$  

$$

\nu _ { k } ( t , T , \Omega _ { t } ) = \int _ { t } ^ { T } \frac { \partial \nu _ { k } ( t , \tau , \Omega _ { t } ) } { \partial \tau } d \tau

$$  

The result in equation (33.6) follows by substituting  

$$

s _ { k } ( t , T , \Omega _ { t } ) = \frac { \hat { \sigma } \nu _ { k } ( t , T , \Omega _ { t } ) } { \hat { \sigma } T }

$$  

# 33.3  

Using the notation in Section 33.1, when $s$ is constant,  

$$

\nu _ { { } _ { T } } ( t , T ) = s \qquad \nu _ { { } _ { T T } } ( t , T ) = 0

$$  

Integrating $\nu _ { { } _ { T } } ( t , T )$  

$$

\nu ( t , T ) = s T + \alpha ( t )

$$  

for some function $\alpha$ . Using the fact that $\nu ( T , T ) = 0$ , we must have  

$$

\nu ( t , T ) = s ( T - t )

$$  

Using the notation from Chapter 32, in Ho–Lee $P ( t , T ) = A ( t , T ) e ^ { - r ( T - t ) }$ . The standard deviation of the short rate is constant. It follows from Itô’s lemma that the standard deviation of the bond price is a constant times the bond price times $T - t$ . The volatility of the bond  

price is therefore constant times $T - t$ . This shows that Ho–Lee is consistent with a constant $s$ .  

33.4 Using the notation in Section 33.1, when $\nu _ { { } _ { T } } ( t , T ) = s ( t , T ) = \sigma e ^ { - a ( T - t ) }$  

$$

\nu _ { \scriptscriptstyle T T } ( t , T ) = - a \sigma e ^ { - a ( T - t ) }

$$  

Integrating $\nu _ { { } _ { T } } ( t , T )$  

$$

\nu ( t , T ) = - \frac { 1 } { a } \sigma e ^ { - a ( T - t ) } + \alpha ( t )

$$  

for some function $\alpha$ . Using the fact that $\nu ( T , T ) = 0$ , we must have  

$$

\nu ( t , T ) = \frac { \sigma } { a } [ 1 - e ^ { - a ( T - t ) } ] = \sigma B ( t , T )

$$  

Using the notation from Chapter 32, in Hull–White $P ( t , T ) = A ( t , T ) e ^ { - r B ( t , T ) }$ . The standard deviation of the short rate is constant, $\sigma$ . It follows from Itô’s lemma that the standard deviation of the bond price is $\sigma P ( t , T ) B ( t , T )$ . The volatility of the bond price is therefore $\sigma B ( t , T )$ . This shows that Hull–White is consistent with $s ( t , T ) = \sigma e ^ { - a ( T - t ) }$ .  

# 33.5  

BGM is a similar model to HJM. It has the advantage over HJM that it involves forward rates that are readily observable. HJM involves instantaneous forward rates.  

# 33.6  

A ratchet cap tends to provide relatively low payoffs if a high (low) interest rate at one reset date is followed by a high (low) interest rate at the next reset date. High payoffs occur when a low interest rate is followed by a high interest rate. As the number of factors increase, the correlation between successive forward rates declines and there is a greater chance that a low interest rate will be followed by a high interest rate.  

# 33.7  

Equation (33.10) can be written  

$$

d F _ { k } ( t ) = \zeta _ { k } ( t ) F _ { k } ( t ) \sum _ { i = m ( t ) } ^ { k } \frac { \delta _ { i } F _ { i } ( t ) \zeta _ { i } ( t ) } { 1 + \delta _ { i } F _ { i } ( t ) } d t + \zeta _ { k } ( t ) F _ { k } ( t ) d z

$$  

As $\delta _ { i }$ tends to zero, $\zeta _ { i } ( t ) F _ { i } ( t )$ becomes the standard deviation of the instantaneous $t _ { i }$ - maturity forward rate at time $t$ . Using the notation of Section 33.1, this is $s ( t , t _ { i } , \Omega _ { t } )$ . As $\delta _ { i }$ tends to zero  

$$

\sum _ { i = m ( t ) } ^ { k } \frac { \delta _ { i } F _ { i } ( t ) \zeta _ { i } ( t ) } { 1 + \delta _ { i } F _ { i } ( t ) }

$$  

tends to  

$$

\int _ { \tau = t } ^ { t _ { k } } s ( t , \tau , \Omega _ { t } ) d \tau

$$  

Equation (33.10) therefore becomes  

$$

d F _ { k } ( t ) = \Big [ s ( t , t _ { k } , \Omega _ { t } ) \Big ] _ { \tau = t } ^ { t _ { k } } s ( t , \tau , \Omega _ { t } ) d \tau \Big ] d t + s ( t , t _ { k } , \Omega _ { t } ) d z

$$  

This is the HJM result.  

# 33.8  

In a ratchet cap, the cap rate equals the previous reset rate, $R$ , plus a spread. In the notation of the text it is $R _ { j } + s$ . In a sticky cap, the cap rate equal the previous capped rate plus a spread. In the notation of the text, it is $\operatorname* { m i n } ( R _ { j } , K _ { j } ) + s$ . The cap rate in a ratchet cap is always at least as great as that in a sticky cap. Since the value of a cap is a decreasing function of the cap rate, it follows that a sticky cap is more expensive.  

33.9 When prepayments increase, the principal is received sooner. This increases the value of a PO. When prepayments increase, less interest is received. This decreases the value of an IO.  

# 33.10  

A bond yield is the discount rate that causes the bond’s price to equal the market price. The same discount rate is used for all maturities. An OAS is the parallel shift to the Treasury zero curve that causes the price of an instrument such as a mortgage-backed security to equal its market price.  

# 33.11  

When there are $p$ factors, equation (33.7) becomes  

$$

d F _ { k } ( t ) = \sum _ { q = 1 } ^ { p } \zeta _ { k , q } ( t ) F _ { k } ( t ) d z _ { q }

$$  

Equation (33.8) becomes  

$$

d F _ { k } ( t ) = \sum _ { q = 1 } ^ { p } \zeta _ { k , q } ( t ) [ { \nu } _ { m ( t ) , q } - { \nu } _ { k + 1 , q } ] F _ { k } ( t ) d t + \sum _ { q = 1 } ^ { p } \zeta _ { k , q } ( t ) ( F _ { k } ( t ) d z _ { q }

$$  

Equation coefficients of $d z _ { q }$ in  

$$

\ln P ( t , t _ { i } ) - \ln P ( t , t _ { i + 1 } ) = \ln [ 1 + \delta _ { i } F _ { i } ( t ) ]

$$  

Equation (33.9) therefore becomes  

$$

\nu _ { i , q } ( t ) - \nu _ { i + 1 , q } ( t ) = \frac { \delta _ { i } F _ { i } ( t ) \zeta _ { i , q } } { 1 + \delta _ { i } F _ { i } ( t ) }

$$  

Equation (33.15) follows.  

# 33.12  

From the equations in the text  

$$

s ( t ) = \frac { P ( t , T _ { 0 } ) - P ( t , T _ { N } ) } { \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } \tau _ { i } P ( t , T _ { i + 1 } ) }

$$  

and  

$$

\frac { P ( t , T _ { i } ) } { P ( t , T _ { 0 } ) } { = } \prod _ { j = 0 } ^ { i - 1 } \frac { 1 } { 1 + \tau _ { j } G _ { j } ( t ) }

$$  

so that  

$$

s ( t ) = \frac { 1 - \prod _ { j = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } \frac { 1 } { 1 + \tau _ { j } G _ { j } ( t ) } } { \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } \tau _ { i } \prod _ { j = 0 } ^ { i } \frac { 1 } { 1 + \tau _ { j } G _ { j } ( t ) } }

$$  

(We employ the convention that empty sums equal zero and empty products equal one.) Equivalently

s ( t ) = \frac { \prod _ { j = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } [ 1 + \tau _ { j } G _ { j } ( t ) ] - 1 } { \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } \tau _ { i } \prod _ { j = i + 1 } ^ { N - 1 } [ 1 + \tau _ { j } G _ { j } ( t ) ] }

$$  

or  

$$

\ln s ( t ) = \ln \left\{ \prod _ { j = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } \left[ 1 + \tau _ { j } G _ { j } ( t ) \right] - 1 \right\} - \ln \left\{ \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } \tau _ { i } \prod _ { j = i + 1 } ^ { N - 1 } \left[ 1 + \tau _ { j } G _ { j } ( t ) \right] \right\}

$$  

so that  

$$

\frac { 1 } { s ( t ) } \frac { \partial s ( t ) } { \partial G _ { k } ( t ) } = \frac { \tau _ { k } \gamma _ { k } ( t ) } { 1 + \tau _ { k } G _ { k } ( t ) }

$$  

where  

$$

\gamma _ { \boldsymbol { k } } ( t ) = \frac { \prod _ { j = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } [ 1 + \tau _ { j } G _ { j } ( t ) ] } { \prod _ { j = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } [ 1 + \tau _ { j } G _ { j } ( t ) ] - 1 } - \frac { \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { k - 1 } \tau _ { i } \prod _ { j = i + 1 } ^ { N - 1 } [ 1 + \tau _ { j } G _ { j } ( t ) ] } { \sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } \tau _ { i } \prod _ { j = i + 1 } ^ { N - 1 } [ 1 + \tau _ { j } G _ { j } ( t ) ] }

$$  

From Ito’s lemma, the $q$ th component of the volatility of $s ( t )$ is  

$$

\sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } \frac { 1 } { s ( t ) } \frac { \hat { o } s ( t ) } { \hat { o } G _ { k } ( t ) } \beta _ { k , q } ( t ) G _ { k } ( t )

$$  

or  

$$

\sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } \frac { \tau _ { k } \beta _ { k , q } ( t ) G _ { k } ( t ) \gamma _ { k } ( t ) } { 1 + \tau _ { k } G _ { k } ( t ) }

$$  

The variance rate of $s ( t )$ is therefore,  

$$

V ( t ) = \sum _ { q = 1 } ^ { p } \Biggl [ \sum _ { k = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } \frac { \tau _ { k } \beta _ { k , q } ( t ) G _ { k } ( t ) \gamma _ { k } ( t ) } { 1 + \tau _ { k } G _ { k } ( t ) } \Biggr ] ^ { 2 }

$$  

33.13.  

$$

1 + \tau _ { j } G _ { j } ( t ) = \prod _ { m = 1 } ^ { M } \left[ 1 + \tau _ { j , m } G _ { j , m } ( t ) \right]

$$  

so that  

$$

\ln [ 1 + \tau _ { j } G _ { j } ( t ) ] = \sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { M } \ln [ 1 + \tau _ { j , m } G _ { j , m } ( t ) ]

$$  

Equating coefficients of $d z _ { q }$  

$$

\frac { \tau _ { j } \beta _ { j , q } ( t ) G _ { j } ( t ) } { 1 + \tau _ { j } G _ { j } ( t ) } = \sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { M } \frac { \tau _ { j , m } \beta _ { j , m , q } ( t ) G _ { j , m } ( t ) } { 1 + \tau _ { j , m } G _ { j , m } ( t ) }

$$  

If we assume that $G _ { j , m } ( t ) = G _ { j , m } ( 0 )$ for the purposes of calculating the swap volatility, we see from equation (33.17) that the volatility becomes  

$$

\sqrt { \frac { 1 } { T _ { 0 } } \int _ { t = 0 } ^ { T _ { 0 } } \sum _ { q = 1 } ^ { p } \left[ \sum _ { k = n } ^ { N - 1 } \sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { M } \frac { \tau _ { k , m } \beta _ { k , m , q } ( t ) G _ { k , m } ( 0 ) \gamma _ { k } ( 0 ) } { 1 + \tau _ { k , m } G _ { k , m } ( 0 ) } \right] ^ { 2 } d t }

$$  

This is equation (33.19).  

# 33.14  

The two types of flexi caps mentioned are more difficult to value than the flexi cap considered in Section 33.2. There are two reasons for this.  

(i) They are American-style. (The holder gets to choose whether a caplet is exercised.) This makes the use of Monte Carlo simulation difficult.   
(ii) They are path dependent. In (a) the decision on whether to exercise a caplet is liable to depend on the number of caplets exercised so far. In (b) the exercise of a caplet is liable to depend on a decision taken some time earlier.  

In practice, flexi caps are sometimes valued using a one-factor model of the short rate in conjunction with the techniques described in Section 27.5 for handling path-dependent derivatives.  

The flexi cap in (b) is worth more than the flexi cap considered in Section 33.2. This is because the holder of the flexi cap in (b) has all the options of the holder of the flexi cap in the text and more. Similarly, the flexi cap in (a) is worth more than the flexi cap in (b). This is because the holder of the flexi cap in (a) has all the options of the holder of the flexi cap in (b) and more. We therefore expect the flexi cap in (a) to be the most expensive and the flexi cap considered in Section 33.2 to be the least expensive.

The fixed rate day count convention is Actual/365. There are 181 days between January 11, 2021, and July 11, 2021. This means that the fixed payments on July 12, 2021, is  

$$

\frac { 1 8 1 } { 3 6 5 } \times 0 . 0 2 \times 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 = \mathcal { S } 9 9 1 , 7 8 1

$$  

Other fixed payments are calculated similarly.  

# 34.2  

Yes. The swap is the same as one on twice the principal where half the fixed rate is exchanged for floating.  

34.3   
The final fixed payment is in millions of dollars: $[ ( 1 . 5 \times 1 . 0 1 6 5 + 1 . 5 ) \times 1 . 0 1 6 5 + 1 . 5 ] \times 1 . 0 1 6 5 + 1 . 5 = 6 . 1 5 0 1$   
The final floating payment assuming forward rates are realized is $( 1 . 5 5 \times 1 . 0 1 6 ~ + 1 . 5 5 ) \times ~ 1 . 0 1 6 + 1 . 5 5 ] \times 1 . 0 1 6 + 1 . 5 5 = ~ 6 . 3 5 0 4$   
The value of the swap is therefore the present value $\mathrm { o f } - 0 . 2 0 0 3 \mathrm { o r } - 0 . 2 0 0 3 / ( 1 . 0 1 5 ^ { 4 } )$   
$= - 0 . 1 8 8 7$ . This makes the small approximation discussed in footnote 1 of Chapter 34.  

# 34.4  

The value is zero. The receive side is the same as the pay side with the cash flows compounded forward at the risk-free rate. Compounding cash flows forward at the risk-free rate does not change their value.  

# 34.5  

Suppose that the fixed rate accrues only when the floating reference rate is below $R _ { \chi }$ and above $R _ { \scriptscriptstyle { Y } }$ where $R _ { { } _ { Y } } < R _ { { } _ { X } }$ . In this case, the swap is a regular swap plus two series of binary options, one for each day of the life of the swap. Using the notation in the text, the riskneutral probability that the floating reference rate will be above $R _ { \scriptscriptstyle { X } }$ on day $i$ is $N ( d _ { 2 } )$ where  

$$

d _ { 2 } = \frac { \ln ( F _ { i } / R _ { \scriptscriptstyle X } ) - \sigma _ { i } ^ { 2 } t _ { i } ^ { 2 } / 2 } { \sigma _ { i } \sqrt { t _ { i } } }

$$  

The probability that it will be below $R _ { Y }$ where $R _ { Y } < R _ { X }$ is $N ( - d ^ { \prime } { } _ { 2 } )$ where  

$$

d ^ { \prime } { _ 2 } \mathrm { = } \frac { \mathrm { l n } ( F _ { i } ^ { \prime } / R _ { \scriptscriptstyle Y } ) - \sigma _ { i } ^ { 2 } t _ { i } ^ { 2 } / 2 } { \sigma _ { i } \sqrt { t _ { i } } }

$$  

From the viewpoint of the party paying fixed, the swap is a regular swap plus binary options. The binary options corresponding to day $i$ have a total value of  

$$

\frac { Q L } { n _ { 2 } } P ( 0 , s _ { i } ) [ N ( d _ { 2 } ) + N ( - d ^ { \prime } _ { 2 } ) ]

$$  

(This ignores the small timing adjustment mentioned in Section 34.6.)  

34.6 There are four payments of USD 0.4 million. The present value in millions of dollars is  

$$

0 . 4 / 1 . 0 2 + 0 . 4 / 1 . 0 2 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 4 / 1 . 0 2 ^ { 3 } + 0 . 4 / 1 . 0 2 ^ { 4 } = 1 . 5 2 3 1

$$  

The forward Australian floating rate is $5 \%$ with annual compounding. The quanto adjustment to the floating payment at time $t _ { i } + 1$ is  

$$

0 . 3 \times 0 . 1 5 \times 0 . 2 5 t i = 0 . 0 1 1 2 5 t i

$$  

The value of the floating payments received is therefore  

$$

0 . 5 / 1 . 0 2 + 0 . 5 \times 1 . 0 1 1 2 5 / 1 . 0 2 ^ { 2 } + 0 . 5 \times 1 . 0 2 2 5 / 1 . 0 2 ^ { 3 } + 0 . 5 \times 1 . 0 3 3 7 5 / 1 . 0 2 ^ { 4 } = 1 . 9 3 5 5

$$  

The value of the swap is $1 . 9 3 5 5 - 1 . 5 2 3 1 = 0 . 4 1 2 4$ million.  

# 34.7  

When the CP rate is $6 . 5 \%$ and Treasury rates are $6 \%$ with semiannual compounding, the $C M T \%$ is $6 \%$ and an Excel spreadsheet can be used to show that the price of a 30-year bond with a $6 . 2 5 \%$ coupon is about 103.46. The spread is zero and the rate paid by P&G is $5 . 7 5 \%$ . When the CP rate is $7 . 5 \%$ and Treasury rates are $7 \%$ with semiannual compounding, the $C M T \%$ is $7 \%$ and the price of a 30-year bond with a $6 . 2 5 \%$ coupon is about 90.65. The spread is therefore,  

$$

\operatorname* { m a x } [ 0 , ( 9 8 . 5 \times 7 / 5 . 7 8 - 9 0 . 6 5 ) / 1 0 0 ]

$$  

or $2 8 . 6 4 \%$ . The rate paid by P&G is $3 5 . 3 9 \%$ .  

# CHAPTER 35 Energy and Commodity Derivatives  

# Practice Questions  

# 35.1  

A day’s HDD is $\operatorname* { m a x } ( 0 , 6 5 - A )$ and a day’s CDD is $\operatorname* { m a x } ( 0 , A - 6 5 )$ where $A$ is the average of the highest and lowest temperature during the day at a specified weather station, measured in degrees Fahrenheit.  

# 35.2  

It is an agreement by one side to deliver a specified amount of gas at a roughly uniform rate during a month to a particular hub for a specified price.  

# 35.3  

The historical data approach to valuing an option involves calculating the expected payoff using historical data and discounting the payoff at the risk-free rate. The risk-neutral approach involves calculating the expected payoff in a risk-neutral world and discounting at the risk-free rate. The two approaches give the same answer when percentage changes in the underlying market variables have zero correlation with stock market returns. (In these circumstances, all risks can be diversified away.)  

# 35.4  

The average temperature each day is $7 5 ^ { \circ }$ . The CDD each day is therefore 10 and the cumulative CDD for the month is $1 0 \times 3 1 = 3 1 0$ . The payoff from the call option is therefore $( 3 1 0 - 2 5 0 ) \times 5 , 0 0 0 = \mathcal { S } 3 0 0 , 0 0 0$ .  

# 35.5  

Unlike most commodities, electricity cannot be stored easily. If the demand for electricity exceeds the supply, as it sometimes does during the air conditioning season, the price of electricity in a deregulated environment will skyrocket. When supply and demand become matched again, the price will return to former levels.  

# 35.6  

There is no systematic risk (i.e., risk that is priced by the market) in weather derivatives and CAT bonds.  

# 35.7  

HDD is $\operatorname* { m a x } ( 6 5 - A , 0 )$ where $A$ is the average of the maximum and minimum temperature during the day. This is the payoff from a put option on $A$ with a strike price of 65. CDD is $\operatorname* { m a x } ( A - 6 5 , 0 )$ . This is the payoff from call option on $A$ with a strike price of 65.  

# 35.8  

It would be useful to calculate the cumulative CDD for July of each year of the last 50 years. A linear regression relationship  

$$

\mathrm { C D D } = a + b t + e

$$  

could then be estimated where $a$ and $b$ are constants, $t$ is the time in years measured from the start of the 50 years, and $e$ is the error. This relationship allows for linear trends in temperature through time. The expected CDD for next year (year 51) is then $a + 5 1 b$ . This could be used as an estimate of the forward CDD.  

# 35.9  

The volatility of the one-year forward price will be less than the volatility of the spot price. This is because, when the spot price changes by a certain amount, mean reversion will cause the forward price will change by a lesser amount.  

# 35.10  

The price of the energy source will show big changes, but will be pulled back to its long-run average level fast. Electricity is an example of an energy source with these characteristics.  

# 35.11  

The energy producer faces quantity risks and price risks. It can use weather derivatives to hedge the quantity risks and energy derivatives to hedge against the price risks.  

# 35.12  

A $5 { \times } 8$ contract is a contract to provide electricity for five days per week during the off-peak period (11PM to 7AM). When daily exercise is specified, the holder of the option is able to choose each weekday whether to buy electricity at the strike price at the agreed rate. When there is monthly exercise, there is one choice at the beginning of the month concerning whether electricity is to be bought at the strike price at the agreed rate for the whole month. The option with daily exercise is worth more.  

# 35.13  

CAT bonds (catastrophe bonds) are an alternative to reinsurance for an insurance company that has taken on a certain catastrophic risk (e.g., the risk of a hurricane or an earthquake) and wants to get rid of it. CAT bonds are issued by the insurance company. They provide a higher rate of interest than government bonds. However, the bondholders agree to forego interest, and possibly principal, to meet any claims against the insurance company that are within a prespecified range.  

# 35.14  

The CAT bond has very little systematic risk. Whether a particular type of catastrophe occurs is independent of the return on the market. The risks in the CAT bond are likely to be largely “diversified away” by the other investments in the portfolio. A B-rated bond does have systematic risk that cannot be diversified away. It is likely therefore that the CAT bond is a better addition to the portfolio.  

# 35.15  

In this case,  

$$

\frac { d S } { S } = \mu ( t ) d t + \sigma d z

$$  

or  

$$

d \ln S = [ \mu ( t ) - \sigma ^ { 2 } / 2 ] d t + \sigma d z

$$  

so that $\ln S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T }$ is normal with mean  

$$

\ln S _ { 0 } + \int _ { t = 0 } ^ { T } \mu ( t ) d t - \sigma ^ { 2 } T / 2

$$  

and standard deviation $\sigma \sqrt { T }$ . Section 35.4 shows that  

$$

\mu ( t ) = \frac { \hat { \sigma } } { \hat { \sigma } t } [ \ln { F ( t ) } ]

$$  

so that  

$$

\int _ { t = 0 } ^ { T } \mu ( t ) d t = \ln { \cal F } ( T ) - \ln { \cal F } ( 0 )

$$  

Since $F ( 0 ) = S _ { 0 }$ the result follows.  

# 35.16  

To find the nodes at the end of one year, we must solve   
$0 . 1 6 6 7 e ^ { 0 . 3 4 6 4 + \mathrm { a } _ { 1 } } + 0 . 6 6 6 6 e ^ { \mathrm { a } _ { 1 } } + 0 . 1 6 6 7 e ^ { - 0 . 3 4 6 4 + \mathrm { a } _ { 1 } } = 2 1$   
The solution is $\mathbf { \alpha } \mathbf { a } _ { 1 } = 3 . 0 2 5$ . To find the nodes at the end of two years, we must solve   
$0 . 0 2 0 3 e ^ { 0 . 6 9 2 8 + \alpha _ { 2 } } + 0 . 2 2 0 6 e ^ { 0 . 3 4 6 4 \alpha _ { 2 } } + 0 . 5 1 8 3 e ^ { \alpha _ { 2 } } + 0 . 2 2 0 6 e ^ { - 0 . 3 4 6 4 \alpha _ { 2 } } + 0 . 0 2 0 3 e ^ { - 0 . 6 9 2 8 + \alpha _ { 2 } } = 2 2 . 0 2 3 e ^ { - 0 . 3 4 6 4 \alpha _ { 2 } }$   
The solution is $\mathbf { \mathrm { q } } _ { 2 } = 3 . 0 5 5$ . This gives the tree in Figure  S35.1. The probabilities on branches are unchanged. Rolling back through the tree, the value of a three-year put option with a strike price of 20 is shown in Figure S35.2 to be 1.68.

# CHAPTER 36 Real Options  

# Practice Questions  

# 36.1  

In the net present value approach, cash flows are estimated in the real world and discounted at a risk-adjusted discount rate. In the risk-neutral valuation approach, cash flows are estimated in the risk-neutral world and discounted at the risk-free interest rate. The riskneutral valuation approach is arguably more appropriate for valuing real options because it is very difficult to determine the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate when options are valued.  

# 36.2  

In a risk-neutral world, the expected price of copper in six months is 75 cents. This corresponds to an expected growth rate of $2 \ln ( 7 5 / 8 0 ) = - 1 2 . 9 \%$ per annum. The decrease in the growth rate when we move from the real world to the risk-neutral world is the volatility of copper times its market price of risk. This is $0 . 2 \times 0 . 5 = 0 . 1$ or $10 \%$ per annum. It follows that the expected growth rate of the price of copper in the real world is $- 2 . 9 \%$ .  

# 36.3  

We explained the concept of a convenience yield for a commodity in Chapter 5. It is a measure of the benefits realized from ownership of the physical commodity that are not realized by the holders of a futures contract. If $y$ is the convenience yield and $u$ is the storage cost, equation (5.17) shows that the commodity behaves like an investment asset that provides a return equal to $y - u$ . In a risk-neutral world its growth is, therefore,  

$$

r - ( y - u ) = r - y + u

$$  

The convenience yield of a commodity can be related to its market price of risk. From Section 36.2, the expected growth of the commodity price in a risk-neutral world is $m - \lambda s$ , where $m$ is its expected growth in the real world, $s$ its volatility, and $\lambda$ is its market price of risk. It follows that  

$$

m - \lambda s = r - y + u

$$  

# 36.4  

In equation (36.2), $\rho = 0 . 2$ , $\mu _ { { } _ { m } } - r = 0 . 0 6$ , and $\sigma _ { { \scriptscriptstyle m } } = 0 . 1 8$ . It follows that the market price of risk lambda is  

$$

\frac { 0 . 2 \times 0 . 0 6 } { 0 . 1 8 } = 0 . 0 6 7

$$  

# 36.5  

The option can be valued using Black’s model. In this case, $F _ { 0 } = 2 4 , K = 2 5 , r = 0 . 0 5$ , $\sigma = 0 . 2$ , and $T = 3$ . The value of an option to purchase one unit at $\$ 25$ is  

$$

e ^ { - r T } [ F _ { 0 } N ( d _ { 1 } ) - K N ( d _ { 2 } ) ]

$$  

where  

$$

\begin{array} { r } { d _ { 1 } = \displaystyle \frac { \ln ( F _ { 0 } / K ) + \sigma ^ { 2 } T / 2 } { \sigma \sqrt { T } } } \\ { d _ { 2 } = \displaystyle \frac { \ln ( F _ { 0 } / K ) - \sigma ^ { 2 } T / 2 } { \sigma \sqrt { T } } } \end{array}

$$  

This is 2.489. The value of the option to purchase one million units is therefore $\$ 2,489,000$ .  

# 36.6  

The expected growth rate of the car price in a risk-neutral world is   
$- 0 . 2 5 - ( - 0 . 1 { \times } 0 . 1 5 ) = - 0 . 2 3 5$ The expected value of the car in a risk-neutral world in four   
years, $\hat { E } ( S _ { T } )$ , is therefore $3 0 , 0 0 0 e ^ { - 0 . 2 3 5 \times 4 } = \mathbb { S } 1 1 , 7 1 9$ . Using the result in the appendix to   
Chapter 15, the value of the option is  

$$

e ^ { - r T } [ \hat { E } ( S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } ) N ( d _ { 1 } ) - K N ( d _ { 2 } ) ]

$$  

where  

$$

d _ { 1 } = \frac { \ln ( \hat { E } ( S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } ) / K ) + \sigma ^ { 2 } T / 2 } { \sigma \sqrt { T } }

$$  

$$

d _ { 2 } = \frac { \ln ( \hat { E } ( S _ { \scriptscriptstyle T } ) / K ) - \sigma ^ { 2 } T / 2 } { \sigma \sqrt { T } }

$$  

$r = 0 . 0 6$ , $\sigma = 0 . 1 5$ , $T = 4$ , and $K = 1 0 , 0 0 0$ . It is $\$ 1,832$ .  

# 36.7  

In this case, $a = 0 . 0 5$ and $\sigma = 0 . 1 5$ . We first define a variable $X$ that follows the process  

$$

d X = - a d t + \sigma d z

$$  

A tree for $X$ constructed in the way described in Chapters 32 and 35 is shown in Figure S36.1. We now displace nodes so that the tree models $\ln S$ in a risk-neutral world where $S$ is the price of wheat. The displacements are chosen so that the initial price of wheat is 250 cents and the expected prices at the ends of the first and second time steps are 260 and 270 cents, respectively. Suppose that the displacement to give $\ln S$ at the end of the first time step is $\alpha _ { \mathrm { { 1 } } }$ . Then  

$$

0 . 1 6 6 7 e ^ { \alpha _ { 1 } + 0 . 1 8 3 7 } + 0 . 6 6 6 6 e ^ { \alpha _ { 1 } } + 0 . 1 6 6 7 e ^ { \alpha _ { 1 } - 0 . 1 8 3 7 } = 2 6 0

$$  

so that $\alpha _ { \mathrm { _ 1 } } { = } 5 . 5 5 5 1$ The probabilities of nodes E, F, G, H, and I being reached are 0.0257, 0.2221, 0.5043, 0.2221, and 0.0257, respectively. Suppose that the displacement to give $\ln S$ at the end of the second step is $\alpha _ { 2 }$ . Then  

$$

0 . 0 2 5 7 e ^ { \alpha _ { 2 } + 0 . 3 6 7 4 } + 0 . 2 2 2 1 e ^ { \alpha _ { 2 } + 0 . 1 8 3 7 } + 0 . 5 0 4 3 e ^ { \alpha _ { 2 } } + 0 . 2 2 2 1 e ^ { \alpha _ { 2 } - 0 . 1 8 3 7 }

$$  

$$
+ 0 . 0 2 5 7 e ^ { \alpha _ { 2 } - 0 . 3 6 7 4 } = 2 7 0
$$  

so that $\alpha _ { 2 } = 5 . 5 8 7 4$ . This leads to the tree for the price of wheat shown in Figure S36.2. Using risk-neutral valuation, the value of the project (in thousands of dollars) is  

$$
- 1 0 - 9 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 0 . 5 } + 2 . 7 0 \times 4 0 e ^ { - 0 . 0 5 \times 1 } = 4 . 9 4
$$  

This shows that the project is worth undertaking. Figure S36.3 shows the value of the project on a tree. The project should be abandoned at node $\mathrm { ~ D ~ }$ for a saving of 2.41. Figure S36.4 shows that the abandonment option is worth 0.39.
