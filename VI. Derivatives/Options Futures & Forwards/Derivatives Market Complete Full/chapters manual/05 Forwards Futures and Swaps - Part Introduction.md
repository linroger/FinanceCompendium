# Forwards, Futures, and Swaps

Forward contracts permit the purchase of an asset in the future at terms that are set today. The pricing of forward and futures contracts can be explored on a wide variety of underlying assets: financial assets (such as stocks, currencies, and bonds) and commodities (such as gold, corn, and natural gas). Swaps have multiple future settlement dates, as opposed to forward contracts, which settle on a single date. Swaps are in effect a bundle of forward contracts combined with borrowing and lending. As such, swaps are a natural generalization of forward contracts.

Forward contracts involve deferring receipt of, and payment for, the underlying asset. Thus, computing the forward price requires you to determine the costs and benefits of this deferral.
