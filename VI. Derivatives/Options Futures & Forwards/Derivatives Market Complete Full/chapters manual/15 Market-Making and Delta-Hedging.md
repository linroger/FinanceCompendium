# Market-Making and Delta-Hedging

At least as important as the Black-Scholes formula is the Black-Scholes technique for deriving the formula. In this chapter we explore the Black-Scholes technique by considering the market-maker perspective on options. What issues confront the market professionals who supply the options that customers want to buy? The insights we gain from studying this question apply not only to pricing call and put options but also to derivatives pricing and risk management in general.

The Black-Scholes approach to deriving the option pricing formula assumes that market-makers are profit-maximizers in a competitive market who want to hedge the risk of their option positions. Market-makers can hedge by taking a stock position that offsets the option's delta. Because option deltas change as the stock price changes, market-makers must continually review and modify their hedging decisions.

We will see that the costs of carrying a hedged option position can be expressed in terms of delta, gamma, and theta. On average, competitive market-makers should expect to break even by hedging. Under certain assumptions about the behavior of the stock price, the market-maker's break-even price is the Black-Scholes option price. Thus, as with any other good in a competitive market, the price of an option should equal the market-maker's cost of producing it.

# I. WHAT DO MARKET-MAKERS DO?

A market-maker stands ready to sell to buyers and to buy from sellers. The owner of an appliance store, for example, is a market-maker. The store owner buys televisions at a low price (the wholesale price) and sells them at cost plus a markup (the retail price), earning the difference. The markup must at a minimum cover the cost of doing business—rent, salaries, utilities, and advertising—so that the retail price covers the cost of acquiring televisions plus all other costs of doing business. The appliance dealer has both a bid price and an ask price. The bid price is the price at which the dealer buys the television, also known as the wholesale price. The ask price is the price at which the dealer will sell the television, also known as the retail price.

An appliance seller does not select which models to sell based on personal preference and does not expect to profit by speculating on the price of a television. Rather, the appliance dealer selects inventory based on expected customer demand and earns profit based on the markup. The store maintains an inventory, and the owner is able to satisfy customers

who walk in and want to buy a television immediately. Market-makers supply immediacy, permitting customers to trade whenever they wish.

Proprietary trading, which is conceptually distinct from market-making, is trading to express an investment strategy. Customers and proprietary traders typically expect their positions to be profitable depending upon whether the market goes up or down. In contrast, market-makers profit by buying at the bid and selling at the ask. The position of a market-maker is the result of whatever order flow arrives from customers.

A difference between appliance sellers and financial market-makers is that an appliance store must possess a physical television in order to sell one. A financial market-maker, by contrast, can supply an asset by short-selling (borrowing shares and selling those shares), thereby generating inventory as needed.

In some cases market-makers may trade as customers, but then the market-maker is paying the bid-ask spread and therefore not serving as a market-maker.

# 2. MARKET-MAKER RISK

Without hedging, an active market-maker will have an arbitrary position generated by fulfilling customer orders. An arbitrary portfolio has uncontrolled risk. An adverse price move has the potential to bankrupt the market-maker. Consequently, market-makers attempt to hedge the risk of their positions.

Market-makers can control risk by delta-hedging. The market-maker computes the option delta and takes an offsetting position in shares. We say that such a position is delta-hedged. In general a delta-hedged position is not a zero-value position: The cost of the shares required to hedge is not the same as the cost of the options. Because of the cost difference, the market-maker must invest capital to maintain a delta-hedged position.

A key idea in derivatives is that such a hedged position should earn the risk-free rate: You have money tied up so you should earn a return on it, and you have no risk so you should earn the risk-free rate. The notion that a hedged position earns the risk-free rate is a linchpin of almost all derivative pricing models. It was the fundamental idea exploited by Black and Scholes in their derivation of the option pricing model.

With the help of a simple numerical example, we can understand not only the intuition of the Black-Scholes model, but the mathematics as well. Delta-hedging is key to pricing because it is the technique for offsetting the risk of an option position. If we think of option producers as selling options at cost, then delta-hedging provides us with an understanding of what the cost of the option is when it is replicated. Delta-hedging is thus both a technique widely used in practice and a key to understanding option pricing.

# Option Risk in the Absence of Hedging

If a customer wishes to buy a 91-day call option, the market-maker fills this order by selling a call option. To be specific, suppose that  $S = \$ 40 ,  $K = \40$ ,  $\sigma = 0.30$ ,  $r = 0.08\$  (continuously compounded), and  $\delta = 0$ . We will let  $T$  denote the expiration time of the option and  $t$  the present, so time to expiration is  $T - t$ . Let  $T - t = 91/365$ . The price, delta, gamma, and theta for this call are listed in Table 1.

Because the market-maker has written the option, the sign of the Greek measures for the position is opposite those of a purchased option. In particular, the written option is like shorting shares of stock (negative delta) and the option gains in value over time (positive

<table><tr><td></td><td>Purchased</td><td>Written</td></tr><tr><td>Call price</td><td>2.7804</td><td>-2.7804</td></tr><tr><td>Delta</td><td>0.5824</td><td>-0.5824</td></tr><tr><td>Gamma</td><td>0.0652</td><td>-0.0652</td></tr><tr><td>Theta</td><td>-0.0173</td><td>0.0173</td></tr></table> theta). Because delta is negative, the risk for the market-maker who has written a call is that the stock price will rise.

Suppose that the market-maker does not hedge the written option and the stock price rises to \$40.75. We can measure the profit of the market-maker by marking-to-market the position. Marking-to-market answers the question: If we liquidated the position today, what would be the gain or loss? In the case of an option price increase, the market-maker would need to buy the option back at a higher price than that at which it was sold, and therefore would lose money. At a stock price of \$40.75, the call price would increase to \$3.2352, so the market-maker profit on a per-share basis would be $2.7804 - $3.2352 = -\$0.4548.1

Figure 1 graphs the overnight profit of the unhedged written call option as a function of the stock price, against the profit of the option at expiration. In computing overnight profit, we are varying the stock price holding fixed all other inputs to the Black-Scholes formula except for time to expiration, which decreases by 1 day. It is apparent from the graph that the risk for the market-maker is a rise in the stock price. Although it is not obvious from the graph, if the stock price does not change, the market-maker will profit because of time decay: It would be possible to liquidate the option position by buying options at a lower price the next day than the price at which they were sold originally.

# Delta and Gamma as Measures of Exposure

Since delta tells us the price sensitivity of the option, it also measures the market-maker's exposure. The delta of the call at a stock price of \$40 is 0.5824, which suggests that a \$1 increase in the stock price should increase the value of the option by approximately $0.5824. A $0.75 increase in the stock price would therefore increase the option price by $0.75 × 0.5824 = $0.4368. However, the actual increase in the option's value is \$0.4548, greater by \$0.0180.

This discrepancy occurs because delta varies with the stock price: As the stock price increases and the option moves more into the money, delta also increases. At a stock price of  \$40.75, delta is 0.6301. Thus, using the delta at\$ 40 will understate the actual change in the value of the option due to a price increase.

Similarly, the delta at  \$40 will overstate the decline in the value of the option due to a stock price decrease. If the stock price had fallen$ 0.75 to $39.25, the option price would have declined to \$2.3622, which would result in a gain of \$0.4182 to the market-maker. Using delta, we would have predicted a price decline of -\$0.75 × 0.5824 = -0.4368, which is greater than the actual decline. This occurs because the option delta decreases as the stock price declines. The delta at this new price is 0.5326.

Gamma measures the change in delta when the stock price changes. In the example above, the gamma of 0.0652 means that delta will change by approximately 0.0652 if the stock price moves 1. This is why delta did not accurately predict the change in the option price: The delta itself was changing as the stock price changed. The ultimate change in the option price is a result of the average delta during the stock price change, not just the delta at the initial stock price. As you might guess, we can use gamma in addition to delta to better approximate the effect on the value of the option of a change in the stock price. We will discuss this adjustment later.

# 3. DELTA-HEDGING

Suppose a market-maker sells one call option and hedges the position with shares. With the sale of a call, the market-maker is short delta shares. To hedge this position, the market-maker can buy delta shares to delta-hedge the position.

We now will consider the risk of a delta-hedged position by assuming that the market-maker delta-hedges and marks-to-market daily. We first look at numerical examples and then in Section 4 explain the results algebraically.

# An Example of Delta-Hedging for 2 Days

Day 0. Consider the 40-strike call option described above, written on 100 shares of stock. The market-maker sells the option and receives \$278.04. Since  $\Delta = 0.5824$ , the market-maker also buys 58.24 shares. (We will permit fractional share purchases in this example.) The net investment is

$$
(5 8. 2 4 \times \$ 4 0) - \$ 2 7 8. 0 4 = \$ 2 0 5 1. 5 6
$$

At an  $8\%$  interest rate, the market-maker has an overnight financing charge of  $\$ 2051.56 \times \left(e^{0.08 / 365} - 1\right) = \$ 0.45$ .

Day 1: Marking-to-Market. Without at first worrying about rebalancing the portfolio to maintain delta-neutrality, we can ask whether the market-maker made money or lost money overnight. Suppose the new stock price is  \$40.50. The new call option price with 1 day less to expiration and at the new stock price is\$ 3.0621. Overnight mark-to-market profit is a gain of 0.50, computed as follows:

<table><tr><td>Gain on 58.24 shares</td><td>58.24 × ($40.50 – $40) = \$29.12</td></tr><tr><td>Gain on written call option</td><td>$278.04 – $306.21 = –\$28.17</td></tr><tr><td>Interest</td><td>-(e0.08/365 - 1) × $2051.56 = –$0.45</td></tr><tr><td>Overnight profit</td><td>0.50</td></tr></table>

Day 1: Rebalancing the Portfolio. The new delta is 0.6142. Since delta has increased, we must buy  $61.42 - 58.24 = 3.18$  additional shares. This transaction requires an investment of  $\$40.50 \times 3.18 = \$128.79$ . Since the readjustment in the number of shares entails buying at the current market price, it does not affect the mark-to-market profits for that day.

Day 2: Marking-to-Market. The stock price now falls to \$39.25. The market-maker makes money on the written option and loses money on the 61.42 shares. Interest expense has increased over the previous day because additional investment was required for the extra shares. The net result from marking-to-market is a loss of -\$3.87:

<table><tr><td>Gain on 61.42 shares</td><td>61.42 × ($39.25 – $40.50) = -\$76.78</td></tr><tr><td>Gain on written call option</td><td>$306.21 – $232.82 = \$73.39</td></tr><tr><td>Interest</td><td>-(e0.08/365 - 1) × $2181.30 = -$0.48</td></tr><tr><td>Overnight profit</td><td>-3.87</td></tr></table>

# Interpreting the Profit Calculation

At the end of day 1, we show a 0.50 profit from the mark-to-market calculation. Conceptually, we can think of the profit or loss as measuring the extent to which the portfolio requires cash infusions in order to maintain a delta-neutral hedge. When we show a positive profit, as in this case, we can take cash out of the portfolio.

To see that mark-to-market profit measures the net cash infusions required to maintain the delta-neutral position, suppose that a lender is willing at all times to lend us the value of securities in the portfolio. Initially, we buy 58.24 shares of stock, which costs  \$2329.60, but this amount is offset by the\$ 278.04 option premium, so the net cash we require is \$2051.56. This is also the net value of our portfolio (stock less the option), so we can borrow this amount. $^2$

As time passes, there are three sources of cash flow into and out of the portfolio:

1. Borrowing: Our borrowing capacity equals the market value of securities in the portfolio; hence, borrowing capacity changes as the net value of the position changes. On day 0, the net value of our securities was \$2051.56. On day 1, the share price rose and we bought additional shares; the market value of the position was 61.42 × $40.50 – $306.21 = \$2181.30. Thus our borrowing capacity increased by 129.74. The change in the option value changes borrowing capacity, but there is no cash flow since we are not changing the number of options.
 2. Purchase or sale of shares: We buy or sell shares as necessary to maintain delta-neutrality. In the above example, we increased shares in our portfolio from 58.24 to 61.42. The price at the time was \$40.50, so we spent 3.18 × \$40.50 = 128.79.
 3. Interest: We pay interest on the borrowed amount. On day 1 we owed 0.45.

Thus, we need \$128.79 to buy more shares and \$0.45 to pay interest expense. The change in our borrowing capacity—the extra amount the bank will lend us—is 129.74. The difference between what the bank will lend us on the one hand and the cost of additional shares plus interest on the other is

$$
\$ 129.74 - \$ 128.79 - \$ 0.45 = \$ 0.50
$$

Since the bank is willing to lend us the value of our securities, we are free to pocket the 0.50 that is left over.

This example demonstrates that the mark-to-market profit equals the net cash flow generated by always borrowing to fully fund the position. Another way to see the equality of mark-to-market profit and net cash flow is by examining the sources and uses of funds, and the extent to which it is necessary to inject additional cash into the position in order to maintain the delta-neutral hedge. We can calculate the net cash flow from the portfolio as

Net cash flow  $=$  Change in borrowing capacity cash used to purchase additional shares

- interest

Let  $\Delta_{i}$  denote the option delta on day  $i$ ,  $S_{i}$  the stock price,  $C_{i}$  the option price, and  $\mathrm{MV}_i$  the market value of the portfolio. Borrowing capacity on day  $i$  is  $\mathrm{MV}_i = \Delta_i S_i - C_i$ ; hence, the change in borrowing capacity is

$$
\mathrm {M V} _ {i} - \mathrm {M V} _ {i - 1} = \Delta_ {i} S _ {i} - C _ {i} - \left(\Delta_ {i - 1} S _ {i - 1} - C _ {i - 1}\right)
$$

The cost of purchasing additional shares is  $S_{i}(\Delta_{i} - \Delta_{i-1})$ , and interest owed on day  $i$  depends on the previous day's borrowing,  $r\mathrm{MV}_{i-1}$ . Thus, on day  $i$  we have

Net cash flow  $= \mathrm{MV}_i - \mathrm{MV}_{i-1} - S_i (\Delta_i - \Delta_{i-1}) - r\mathrm{MV}_{i-1}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \Delta_ {i} S _ {i} - C _ {i} - \left(\Delta_ {i - 1} S _ {i - 1} - C _ {i - 1}\right) - S _ {i} \left(\Delta_ {i} - \Delta_ {i - 1}\right) - r \mathrm {M V} _ {i - 1} \\ = \Delta_ {i - 1} \left(S _ {i} - S _ {i - 1}\right) - \left(C _ {i} - C _ {i - 1}\right) - r \mathrm {M V} _ {i - 1} \\ \end{array}
$$

The last expression is the overnight gain on shares, less the overnight gain on the option, less interest; this result is identical to the profit calculation we performed above. In the numerical example, we have

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {M V} _ {1} - \mathrm {M V} _ {0} - S _ {1} \left(\Delta_ {1} - \Delta_ {0}\right) - r \mathrm {M V} _ {0} = \\ 2 1 8 1. 3 0 - \\ 2 0 5 1. 5 6 - \\ 1 2 8. 7 9 - \\ 0. 4 5 \\ = \$ 0.50 \\ \end{array}
$$

This value is equal to the overnight profit we calculated between day 0 and day 1.

Thus, we can interpret the daily mark-to-market profit or loss as the amount of cash that we can pocket (if there is a profit) or that we must pay (if there is a loss) in order to fund required purchases of new shares and to continue borrowing exactly the amount of our securities. When we have a positive profit, as on day 1, we can take money out of the portfolio, and when we have a negative profit, as on day 2, we must put money into the portfolio.

A hedged portfolio that never requires additional cash investments to remain hedged is self-financing. One of the questions we will answer is under what conditions a delta-hedged portfolio is self-financing.

# Delta-Hedging for Several Days

We can continue the example by letting the market-maker rebalance the portfolio each day. Table 2 summarizes delta, the net investment, and profit each day for 5 days. The profit line in the table is daily profit, not cumulative profit.

What determines the pattern of gain and loss in the table? There are three effects, attributable to gamma, theta, and the carrying cost of the position.

1. Gamma: For the largest moves in the stock, the market-maker loses money. For small moves in the stock price, the market-maker makes money. The loss for large moves

TABLE 2

In this case, since the market-maker is short the option, a large move generates a loss. As the stock price rises, the delta of the call increases and the call loses money faster than the stock makes money. As the stock price falls, the delta of the call decreases and the call makes money more slowly than the fixed stock position loses money. In effect, the market-maker becomes unhedged net long as the stock price falls and unhedged net short as the stock price rises. The losses on days 2 and 4 are attributable to gamma. For all of the entries in Table 2, the gamma of the written call is about  $-0.06$  per share.

2. Theta: If a day passes with no change in the stock price, the option becomes cheaper. This time decay works to the benefit of the market-maker who could unwind the position more cheaply. Time decay is especially evident in the profit on day 5, but is also responsible for the profit on days 1 and 3.
3. Interest cost: In order to hedge, the market-maker must purchase stock. The net carrying cost is a component of the overall cost.

Figure 2 graphs overnight market-maker profit on day 1 as a function of the stock price on day 1. At a stock price of 40.50, for example, the profit is 0.50, just as in the table. The graph is generated by recomputing the first day's profit per share for a variety of stock prices between 37 and 43. The graph verifies what is evident in the table: The delta-hedging market-maker who has written a call wants small stock price moves and can suffer a substantial loss with a big move. In fact, should the stock price move to 37.50, for example, the market-maker would lose 20.

If the market-maker had purchased a call and shorted delta shares, the profit calculation would be reversed. The market-maker would lose money for small stock price moves and make money with large moves. The profit diagram for such a position would be a mirror image of Figure 2.

# A Self-Financing Portfolio: The Stock Moves One  $\sigma$

In the previous example, the stock price changes by varying amounts and our daily profit varies substantially. However, in Figure 2, there is an up move and a down move for the stock such that the market-maker exactly breaks even in our profit calculations. If the stock always moved by this amount, the portfolio would be self-financing: No cash inflows are required to maintain delta-neutrality. It turns out that the portfolio is self-financing if the stock moves by one standard deviation.

Table 3 shows the results of the stock moving up, down three times, and then up. You can see that the market-maker comes close to breaking even each day. If the stock moves according to the binomial model, therefore, the portfolio is approximately self-financing.

# 4. THE MATHEMATICS OF DELTA-HEDGING

Clearly, delta, gamma, and theta all play a role in determining the profit on a delta-hedged position. In this section we examine these relationships more closely in order to better understand the numerical example above. What we do here is a kind of financial forensics: Once we learn how the stock price changed, we seek to discover why we earned the profit we did.

# Using Gamma to Better Approximate the Change in the Option Price

Delta alone is an inaccurate predictor of the change in the option price because delta changes with the stock price. When delta is very sensitive to the stock price (gamma is large), the inaccuracy will be relatively great. When delta is not sensitive to the stock price (gamma is small), the inaccuracy will be relatively small. Since gamma measures the change in delta, we can use gamma to develop a better approximation for the change in the option price.

If the stock price were \$40.75 instead of \$40, the option price would be \$3.2352 instead of \$2.7804. For the purpose of computing the change in the option price, we want to know the average rate of price increase between \$40 and \$40.75, which we can approximate by averaging the deltas at \$40 and \$40.75:

$$
\Delta_ {\text {a v e r a g e}} = \frac {\Delta_ {4 0} + \Delta_ {4 0 . 7 5}}{2}
$$

We could then approximate the option price at 40.75 by computing

$$
C (\$ 4 0. 7 5) = C (\$ 4 0) + 0. 7 5 \times \Delta_ {\text {a v e r a g e}} \tag {1}
$$

When we average the deltas at  \$40 and\$ 40.75, we have to compute deltas at two different stock prices. A different approach is to approximate the average delta by using only the delta evaluated at  \$40 together with gamma. Since gamma measures the change in delta, we can approximate the delta at\$ 40.75 by adding  $0.75 \times \Gamma$  to  $\Delta_{40}$ :

$$
\Delta_ {4 0. 7 5} = \Delta_ {4 0} + 0. 7 5 \times \Gamma
$$

Using this relationship, the average delta is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta_ {\text {a v e r a g e}} = \frac {\Delta_ {4 0} + (\Delta_ {4 0} + 0 . 7 5 \times \Gamma)}{2} \\ = \Delta_ {4 0} + \frac {1}{2} \times 0. 7 5 \times \Gamma \\ \end{array}
$$

Using equation (1), we can then approximate the call price as

$$
\begin{array}{l} C (\mathbb {S} 4 0. 7 5) = C (\mathbb {S} 4 0) + 0. 7 5 \times \Delta_ {\text {a v e r a g e}} \\ = C (\$ 4 0) + 0. 7 5 \times \left(\Delta_ {4 0} + \frac {1}{2} \times 0. 7 5 \times \Gamma\right) \\ = C (\$ 4 0) + 0. 7 5 \times \Delta_ {4 0} + \frac {1}{2} \times 0. 7 5 ^ {2} \times \Gamma \tag {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

The use of delta and gamma to approximate the new option price is called a delta-gamma approximation.

Example I. If the stock price rises from $40 to $40.75, the option price increases from $2.7804 to $3.2352. Using a delta approximation alone, we would estimate C(40.75) as

$$
C (\$ 4 0. 7 5) = C (\$ 4 0) + 0. 7 5 \times 0. 5 8 2 4 = \$ 3. 2 1 7 2
$$

Using a delta-gamma approximation, we obtain

$$
C (\$ 4 0. 7 5) = C (\$ 4 0) + 0. 7 5 \times 0. 5 8 2 4 + \frac {1}{2} \times 0. 7 5 ^ {2} \times 0. 0 6 5 2 = \$ 3. 2 3 5 5
$$

The delta-gamma approximation is significantly closer to the true option price at 40.75 than is the delta approximation.

Similarly, for a stock price decline to  \$39.25, the true option price is\$ 2.3622. The delta approximation gives

$$
C (\mathbb {S} 3 9. 2 5) = C (\mathbb {S} 4 0) - 0. 7 5 \times 0. 5 8 2 4 = \mathbb {S} 2. 3 4 3 6
$$

The delta-gamma approximation gives

$$
C (\$ 3 9. 2 5) = C (\$ 4 0) - 0. 7 5 \times 0. 5 8 2 4 + \frac {1}{2} \times 0. 7 5 ^ {2} \times 0. 0 6 5 2 = \$ 2. 3 6 1 9
$$

Again, the delta-gamma approximation is more accurate.

# Delta-Gamma Approximations

We now repeat the previous arguments using algebra. For a "small" move in the stock price, we know that the rate at which delta changes is given by gamma. Thus, if over a time interval of length  $h$  the stock price change is

$$
\epsilon = S _ {t + h} - S _ {t}
$$ then gamma is the change in delta per dollar of stock price change, or


$$

\Gamma (S _ {t}) = \frac {\Delta (S _ {t + h}) - \Delta (S _ {t})}{\epsilon}

$$

Rewriting this expression, delta will change by approximately the magnitude of the price change,  $\epsilon$ , times gamma,  $\epsilon \Gamma$ :

$$

\Delta \left(S _ {t + h}\right) = \Delta \left(S _ {t}\right) + \epsilon \Gamma \left(S _ {t}\right) \tag {3}

$$

If the rate at which delta changes is constant (meaning that gamma is constant), this calculation is exact.

How does equation (3) help us compute the option price change? If the stock price changes by  $\epsilon$ , we can compute the option price change if we know the average delta over the range  $S_{t + h}$  to  $S_{t}$ . If  $\Gamma$  is approximately constant, the average delta is simply the average of  $\Delta(S_{t})$  and  $\Delta(S_{t + h})$ , or (using equation (3))

$$

\frac {\Delta \left(S _ {t}\right) + \Delta \left(S _ {t + h}\right)}{2} = \Delta \left(S _ {t}\right) + \frac {1}{2} \epsilon \Gamma \left(S _ {t}\right) \tag {4}

$$

The option price at the new stock price is the initial option price,  $C(S_{t})$ , plus the average delta times the change in the stock price, or

$$

C (S _ {t + h}) = C (S _ {t}) + \epsilon \left[ \frac {\Delta (S _ {t}) + \Delta (S _ {t + h})}{2} \right]

$$

Using equation (4), we can rewrite this to express  $\Delta(S_{t + h})$  in terms of  $\Gamma(S_t)$ :

$$

C \left(S _ {t + h}\right) = C \left(S _ {t}\right) + \epsilon \Delta \left(S _ {t}\right) + \frac {1}{2} \epsilon^ {2} \Gamma \left(S _ {t}\right) \tag {5}

$$

The gamma correction is independent of the direction of the change in the stock price because gamma is multiplied by  $\epsilon^2$ , which is always positive. When the stock price goes up, delta alone predicts too little a change in the call price, and we have to add something to correct the prediction. When the stock price goes down, delta alone predicts too much of a decrease in the option price, and we again have to add something to correct the prediction.

The new predicted call price is not perfect because gamma changes as the stock price changes. We could add a term correcting for the change in gamma, and a term correcting for the change in the change in gamma, and so forth, but the gamma correction alone dramatically improves the accuracy of the approximation. You might recognize equation (5) as a second-order (because it uses the first and second derivatives, delta and gamma) Taylor series approximation for the change in the call price. Taylor series approximations are discussed in Appendix A.

Figure 3 shows the result of approximating the option price using the delta and delta-gamma approximations. The delta approximation is a straight line tangent to the option price curve and is always below the option price curve. Because of this, the delta approximation understates the option price, whether the stock price rises or falls. The delta-gamma approximation uses the squared stock price change, which generates a curve more closely approximating the option price curve.

# Theta: Accounting for Time

The preceding calculations measured the option risk that arises from price changes alone. Of course, as the price changes, time is passing and the option is approaching maturity.

The option's theta  $(\theta)$  measures the option's change in price due to time passing, holding the stock price fixed. For a period of length  $h$ , the change in the option price will be  $\theta h$ . For example, consider the 91-day option in Section 3 and consider the effect of a day passing, with no change in the stock price. Since the variables in the option pricing formula are expressed as annual values, a one-unit change in  $T - t$  implies a  $\theta$  of  $-6.33251$ . Since  $h$  is  $1/365$ , the implied daily option price change is  $-6.33251/365 = -0.01735$ .

Adding theta to our previous option price prediction equation, we have

$$

\begin{array}{l} C \left(S _ {t + h}, T - t - h\right) = C \left(S _ {t}, T - t\right) \tag {6} \\ + \epsilon \Delta (S _ {t}, T - t) + \frac {1}{2} \epsilon^ {2} \Gamma (S _ {t}, T - t) + h \theta (S _ {t}, T - t) \\ \end{array}

$$

The experiment reflected in this equation is this: Starting with an option with  $T - t$  periods until expiration and a stock price of  $S_{t}$ , we want to express the new option price as a function of the old price and the delta, gamma, and theta evaluated at the original price and time to

# FIGURE 3

Predicted option price over a period of 1 day, assuming stock price move of  $0.75, using equation (6). Assumes that \sigma = 0.3, r = 0.08, T - t = 91 days, and \delta = 0, and the initial stock price is$ 40.

This formula is quite accurate for relatively small changes in time and in the stock price.


Example 2. Table 4 shows the results from using equation (6) to predict the option price change when prices move by  $0.75 (\epsilon = \pm 0.75)$ . In this example,  $\Delta = 0.5824$ ,  $\Gamma = 0.0652$ , and  $h\theta = -0.0173$ . Note that in each case the formula slightly overstates the change, but the predicted price is close to the actual price.

# Understanding the Market-Maker's Profit

The calculations in Tables 2 and 3 use actual option price changes over 1 day, not approximations. However, by using equation (6) to approximate the change in the option price we can better understand the profit results in those tables.

The value of the market-maker's investment—long delta shares and short a call—is the value of delta shares of stock less the value of the call, or

$$

\Delta_ {t} S _ {t} - C \left(S _ {t}\right)

$$

Suppose that over the time interval  $h$ , the stock price changes from  $S_{t}$  to  $S_{t + h}$ . The change in the value of the portfolio is the change in the value of the stock and option positions, less interest expense:

$$

\underbrace {\Delta_ {t} \left(S _ {t + h} - S _ {t}\right)} _ {\text {C h a n g e i n v a l u e o f s t o c k}} - \underbrace {[ C \left(S _ {t + h}\right) - C \left(S _ {t}\right) ]} _ {\text {C h a n g e i n v a l u e o f o p t i o n}} - \underbrace {r h [ \Delta_ {t} S _ {t} - C \left(S _ {t}\right) ]} _ {\text {I n t e r e s t e x p e n s e}}

$$

Now recall equation (6), in which we characterized the change in the option price. Substituting equation (6) for  $C(S_{t + h}) - C(S_t)$  in this expression tells us

$$

\begin{array}{l} \Delta_ {t} (S _ {t + h} - S _ {t}) - [ \Delta_ {t} (S _ {t + h} - S _ {t}) + \frac {1}{2} (S _ {t + h} - S _ {t}) ^ {2} \Gamma_ {t} + \theta_ {t} h ] - r h [ \Delta_ {t} S _ {t} - C (S _ {t}) ] \\ = - \left(\frac {1}{2} \epsilon^ {2} \Gamma_ {t} + \theta_ {t} h + r h [ \Delta_ {t} S _ {t} - C (S _ {t}) ]\right) \tag {7} \\ \end{array}

$$

This expression gives us the profit of the market-maker when the stock price changes by  $\epsilon$  over an interval of length  $h$ .

On the right-hand side of equation (7) we see the effects of gamma, theta, and interest:

1. Gamma: The effect of gamma is measured by  $-\frac{1}{2}\epsilon^2\Gamma_t$ . Since the gamma of the call is positive, by writing the call the market-maker will lose money in proportion to the square of the stock price change. The larger the stock move, the greater is the loss.
2. Theta: The effect of theta is measured by  $-\theta_{t}h$ . Since theta for the call is negative, the option writer benefits from theta.
3. Interest cost: Interest is measured by  $-rh[\Delta_t S_t - C(S_t)]$ . The option writer has a net investment because  $\Delta_t$  shares are more expensive than one option. Hence, interest is a net cost.

Since  $\theta$  is negative, time decay benefits the market-maker, whereas interest and gamma work against the market-maker.

Let's examine how  $\epsilon$ , the change in the stock price, enters equation (7). Note first that because we have delta-hedged,  $\epsilon$  itself does not affect market-maker profit. However, profit does depend on the squared change in the stock price,  $\epsilon^2$ . Consequently, as we saw in Table 2, it is the magnitude—not the direction of the stock price move—that determines profit.

Table 5 calculates equation (7) for various moves in the stock price. Because equation (7) depends only on the squared stock price move, the calculation is the same for moves up and down.

TABLE 5

Predicted effect, using equation (7), of different-sized stock price moves on the profit of a delta-hedged market-maker.

Absolute Value

<table><tr><td>of Price Move, |€|</td><td>-1/2ε2Γ - θh - rh[ΔSt - C(St)]</td></tr><tr><td>0.0000</td><td>1.283</td></tr><tr><td>0.2500</td><td>1.080</td></tr><tr><td>0.5000</td><td>0.470</td></tr><tr><td>0.6281</td><td>0.000</td></tr><tr><td>0.7500</td><td>-0.546</td></tr><tr><td>1.0000</td><td>-1.970</td></tr><tr><td>1.5000</td><td>-6.036</td></tr></table>

If the stock price moves 0.6281, equation (7) is exactly zero. We have already seen in Table 3 that the market-maker approximately breaks even for a one-standard-deviation move in the stock. Here we arrive at the same result. Let's explore this idea further.

If  $\sigma$  is measured annually, then a one-standard-deviation move over a period of length  $h$  is  $\sigma S_t\sqrt{h}$ . Therefore a squared one-standard-deviation move is

$$

\epsilon^ {2} = \sigma^ {2} S _ {t} ^ {2} h \tag {8}

$$

Substituting this expression for  $\epsilon^2$ , we can rewrite equation (7) as

$$

\text {M a r k e t - m a k e r} = - \left(\frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {2} S _ {t} ^ {2} \Gamma_ {t} + \theta_ {t} + r \left[ \Delta_ {t} S _ {t} - C \left(S _ {t}\right) \right]\right) h \tag {9}

$$

This expression gives us market-maker profit when the stock moves one standard deviation. As an example, let  h = 1 / 365  and  \sigma = 0.3 . Then  \sigma S\sqrt{h} = \0.6281 . From Table 5, with this stock price move equation (9) is exactly zero! (Problem 13 asks you to verify this.) It is not an accident that equation (9) is zero for this price move. We explain this result in Section 5.

In Table 5, the loss from a 1 move is substantially larger in absolute value than the gain from no move. However, small moves are more probable than big moves. If we think of returns as being approximately normally distributed, then stock price moves greater than one standard deviation occur about one-third of the time. The market-maker thus expects to make small profits about two-thirds of the time and larger losses about one-third of the time. On average, the market-maker will break even.

# 5. THE BLACK-SCHOLES ANALYSIS

We have discussed how a market-maker can measure and manage the risk of a portfolio containing options. What is the link to pricing an option?

# The Black-Scholes Argument

If a stock moves one standard deviation, then a delta-hedged position will exactly break even, taking into account the cost of funding the position. This finding is not a coincidence; it reflects the arguments Black and Scholes used to derive the option pricing formula.

Imagine, for example, that the stock always moves exactly one standard deviation every minute. A market-maker hedging every minute will be hedged over an hour or over any period of time. Black and Scholes argued that the money invested in this hedged position should earn the risk-free rate since the resulting income stream is risk-free.

Equation (9) gives us an expression for market-maker profit when the stock moves one standard deviation. Setting this expression to zero gives

$$

\left. - \left(\frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {2} S _ {t} ^ {2} \Gamma_ {t} + \theta_ {t} + r [ \Delta_ {t} S _ {t} - C (S _ {t}) ]\right) h = 0 \right.

$$

If we divide by  $h$  and rearrange terms, we get

$$

\boxed {\frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {2} S _ {t} ^ {2} \Gamma_ {t} + r S _ {t} \Delta_ {t} + \theta_ {t} = r C (S _ {t})} \tag {10}

$$

This is the equation Black and Scholes used to characterize the behavior of an option. The Greeks  $\Gamma$ ,  $\Delta$ , and  $\theta$  are partial derivatives of the option price. Equation (10) is the well-known Black-Scholes partial differential equation, or just Black-Scholes equation (as opposed to the Black-Scholes formula for the price of a European call). This relationship among the Greeks is as fundamental in valuing risky cash flows as is  $e^{-rT}$  when valuing risk-free cash flows.

Equation (10) embodies numerous assumptions, among them that the underlying asset does not pay a dividend, the option itself does not pay a dividend, the interest rate and volatility are constant, and the stock does not make large discrete moves. With these assumptions, equation (10) holds for calls, puts, American options, European options, and most of the exotic variants. With simple modifications, an equation like (10) will also hold for options on dividend-paying stocks, currencies, futures, bonds, etc. The link between delta-hedging and pricing is one of the most important ideas in finance.

# Delta-Hedging of American Options

Equation (10) holds for American options as well as for European options, but it does not hold at times when it is optimal to early-exercise the option. Consider a deep in-the-money American put option and suppose the option should be exercised early. Since early exercise is optimal, the option price is  $K - S$ ; hence,  $\Delta = -1$ ,  $\Gamma = 0$ , and  $\theta = 0$ . In this case, equation (10) becomes

$$

\left[ r \times (- 1) \times S _ {t} \right] + \left(\frac {1}{2} \times 0\right) + 0 = r \times (K - S _ {t})

$$

Note that  $-rS_{t}$  appears on both sides of the equation. Thus, we can rewrite the equation as

$$

0 = r K

$$

Since this equation is false, something is wrong. We began by assuming that the put was so far in-the-money that it should be early-exercised. This means that interest received on the strike exceeds the loss of the implicit call option. Thus, if the option should be exercised but you own it, delta-hedge it, and do not exercise it, then you lose interest on the strike you are not receiving. Similarly, if you have written the option and delta-hedged, and the owner does not exercise, then you are earning arbitrage profit of  $rK$ .

Thus, equation (10) is only valid in a region where early exercise is not optimal. If an option should be exercised but is not exercised, then behavior is irrational and there is no reason why a delta-hedged position should earn the risk-free rate and thus no reason that equation (10) should hold.

# What Is the Advantage to Frequent Re-Hedging?

In practice, because of transaction costs, it is expensive for a market-maker to trade shares for every change in an option delta. Instead, a delta-hedger will wait for the position to become somewhat unhedged before trading to reestablish delta-neutrality. We assume that market-makers maintain their hedged position at all times. What does the market-maker lose by hedging less frequently?

Boyle and Emanuel (1980) considered a market-maker who delta-hedges at set intervals, rather than every time the stock price changes. Let  $x_{i}$  denote the number of standard deviations the stock price moves—we can think of  $x_{i}$  as being drawn randomly from the standard normal distribution. Also let  $R_{h,i}$  denote the period-  $i$  return to a delta-hedged market-maker who has purchased a call. Boyle and Emanuel show that this return can be written as

$$

R _ {h, i} = \frac {1}{2} S ^ {2} \sigma^ {2} \Gamma \left(x _ {i} ^ {2} - 1\right) h \tag {11}

$$ where  $\Gamma$  is the option's gamma and  $h$  is the time interval between hedge readjustments. For a delta-hedging call writer, the return has the opposite sign. From Boyle and Emanuel, the variance of  $x_{i}^{2} - 1$  is 2; hence,

$$
\operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {h, i}\right) = \frac {1}{2} \left(S ^ {2} \sigma^ {2} \Gamma h\right) ^ {2} \tag {12}
$$

We assume—as in the binomial model—that the stock return is uncorrelated across time, so that  $x_{i}$  is uncorrelated across time.

Now let's compare hedging once a day against hedging hourly (suppose trading occurs around the clock). The daily variance of the return earned by the market-maker who hedges once a day is given by

$$
\operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {1 / 3 6 5, 1}\right) = \frac {1}{2} \left(S ^ {2} \sigma^ {2} \Gamma / 3 6 5\right) ^ {2}
$$

The daily return of the market-maker who hedges hourly is the sum of the hourly returns. Assuming for the sake of simplicity that  $S$  and  $\Gamma$  do not change much, that variance is

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {V a r} \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {2 4} R _ {h, i}\right) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {2 4} \frac {1}{2} \left[ S ^ {2} \sigma^ {2} \Gamma / (2 4 \times 3 6 5) \right] ^ {2} \\ = \frac {1}{2 4} \times \operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {1 / 3 6 5, 1}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus, by hedging hourly instead of daily the market-maker's total return variance is reduced by a factor of 24.

Here is the intuition for this result. Whatever the hedging interval, about two-thirds of the price moves will be less than a single standard deviation, whereas one-third will be greater. Frequent re-hedging does not avoid these large or small moves, since they can occur over any interval. However, frequent hedging does permit better averaging of the effects of these moves. Whether you hedge once a day or once an hour, the typical stock price move you encounter will likely not be close to one standard deviation. However, if you hedge every hour, over the course of a day you will have 24 moves and 24 opportunities to re-hedge. The average move over this period is likelier to be close to one standard deviation. The gains from small moves and losses from large moves will tend to average over the course of a day. In effect, the more frequent hedger benefits from diversification over time.[6]

Example 3. Using Boyle and Emanuel's formulas to study the market-maker problem in Section 3, the standard deviation of profit is about  \$0.075 for a market-maker who hedges hourly. Since hedging errors are independent from hour to hour, the daily standard deviation for an hourly hedger would be$ 0.075 × \sqrt{24} = $0.37. If the market-maker were to hedge only daily as in our example, the daily standard deviation would be about \$1.82.

As you would expect, the mean return on a delta-hedged position is the risk-free rate, even if the hedge is not frequently readjusted.

# Delta-Hedging in Practice

The Black-Scholes analysis outlined here is the linchpin of modern option pricing theory and practice. Market-makers use equation (10) to price options, subject to qualifications mentioned above.

We have seen, however, that delta-hedging does not eliminate risk. One problem, which we emphasized above, is that a delta-hedged portfolio with negative gamma can sustain losses due to large moves in the price of the underlying asset. Consequently, a delta-hedging market-maker needs to worry about gamma. Another problem, discussed in Box 1, is that firms can unexpectedly change their dividend payments.

There are at least four ways a market-maker can try to reduce the risk of extreme price moves. Note that some of these strategies require the market-maker to acquire specific option positions, which means that the market-maker may have to pay the bid-ask spread. Since the bid-ask spread is revenue for the market-maker, paying the spread is undesirable.

First, just as market-makers can adopt a delta-neutral position, they can also adopt a gamma-neutral position. This position cannot be achieved with the stock alone, since the gamma of the stock is zero. Thus, to be gamma-neutral the market-maker must buy or sell options so as to offset the gamma of the existing position. We provide an example of gamma-neutrality below.

Second, in a related strategy, market-makers can use static option replication, a strategy in which options are used to hedge options. In our delta-hedging example, the market-maker might not be able to buy an exactly offsetting call option to hedge the written call, but by selectively setting the bid and ask prices for related options, might be able to acquire an option position requiring only infrequent rebalancing. To take a simple example, if the market-maker were able to buy a put with the same strike price and maturity as the written call (e.g., by setting the bid price to attract any seller of that option), then by buying 100 shares to offset the risk of the position, the market-maker would have used put-call parity to create a hedge that is both gammaand delta-neutral for the life of the options.

Third, a market-maker can buy out-of-the-money options as insurance. In our example of delta-neutral hedging of a written option, the market-maker could buy a deep out-of-the-money put and a deep out-of-the-money call. The two options would be relatively inexpensive and would protect against large moves in the stock. One problem with this solution is that, since option positions in the aggregate sum to zero, the market-making community as a whole can buy protective options only if investors in the aggregate are willing to sell them. Investors, however, are usually thought to be insurance buyers rather than insurance sellers.

Fourth, a market-maker can create a financial product by selling the hedging error, as discussed by Carr and Madan (1998). For example, to hedge a negative-gamma, delta-neutral position, the market-maker would make a payment to a counterparty if the stock makes a small move in either direction, and receive payment from the counterparty if the stock makes a large move in either direction. This is effectively a variance swap. The point is that the market-maker can potentially solve the delta-hedging problem by creating a new product.

# Gamma-Neutrality

Let's explore gamma-hedging in more depth. Suppose we wish to both delta-hedge and gamma-hedge the written option described in Table 1. We cannot do this using just the stock, because the gamma of stock is zero. Hence, we must acquire another option in an amount that offsets the gamma of the written call. Table 6 presents information for the 3-month 40-strike call, and also for a 4-month 45-strike call. We will use the latter to gamma-hedge the former.

# BOX I: Dividend Risk

Market-makers price options taking into account the dividends they expect a stock to pay. If a firm announces a significant change in dividend policy, delta-hedgers can make or lose money depending on their position and depending on whether the derivatives they hold are protected against dividend changes.

In 1998, Daimler-Benz surprised option market-makers by announcing a special one-time dividend, creating a dividend payout of about  $14\%$ , or 10 times the usual dividend yield. The Deutsche Terminbörse (DTB), the exchange where Daimler options were traded, decided not to adjust the terms of exchange-traded options to account for the dividend. The DTB was criticized for this, and some dealers were said to have sustained significant losses.

The stated policy of the Options Clearing Corporation (1994, 2003 supplement) in the United States is that typically there is adjustment only for "extraordinary" cash dividends or distributions, i.e., those exceeding  $10\%$  of the market value of the underlying security outstanding. Determinations … are made on a case-by-case basis."

In July 2004 Microsoft announced that it would make a special one-time payment of  \$3/share, a dividend yield in excess of 10\%$  based on Microsoft's price at the time of the announcement. The Options Clearing Corporation in the United States responded by declaring that it would reduce strike prices on Microsoft options by 3 when the dividend was paid.

The ratio of the gamma of the two options is

$$
\frac {\Gamma_ {K = 4 0 , t = 0 . 2 5}}{\Gamma_ {K = 4 5 , t = 0 . 3 3}} = \frac {0 . 0 6 5 1}{0 . 0 5 2 4} = 1. 2 4 0 8 \tag {13}
$$

Thus, we need to buy 1.2408 of the 45-strike 4-month options for every 40-strike 3-month option we have sold. The Greeks resulting from the position are in the last column of Table 6. Since delta is  $-0.1749$ , we need to buy 17.49 shares of stock to be both deltaand gamma-hedged.

Figure 4 compares this deltaand gamma-hedged position to the delta-hedged position, discussed earlier, in which the same call was written. The delta-hedged position has the problem that large moves always cause losses. The gamma-hedged position loses less if there is a large move down, and can make money if the stock price increases. Moreover, as Table 6 shows, the gamma-hedged position has a positive vega. Why would anyone not gamma-hedge?

There are two reasons. First, as noted already, gamma-hedging requires the use of additional options. The market-maker will have to obtain the required option position from another market-maker, paying the bid-ask spread. In this example, all profits earned from writing the 40-strike call will go to pay the market-maker who sells the 45-strike call used in gamma-hedging.

Second, if end-users on average buy puts and calls, then in the aggregate they have positive gamma (the end-users "buy gamma," to use market-making parlance). By definition, market-makers in the aggregate must then have negative gamma. Thus, while in principle any one market-maker could gamma-hedge, not all market-makers could be gamma-neutral. If investors want to buy insurance, they will not be gamma-neutral, and, hence, market-makers cannot in the aggregate be gamma-neutral.

In addition to gamma, other risks, such as vega and rho, can be hedged in the same fashion as delta.

# 6. MARKET-MAKING AS INSURANCE

The preceding discussion suggests that market-makers who write options can sustain large losses, even if they delta-hedge. This conclusion suggests that option market-making (and derivatives market-making more generally) has more in common with insurance than you might at first think.

# Insurance

Insurance companies attempt to pool diversifiable risks. All insured individuals pay an insurance premium. The premiums are then used to compensate those who suffer losses, while those without losses forfeit the premium. Insurance thereby spreads the pain rather than forcing a few unlucky individuals to bear the brunt of inevitable losses.

In the classic model of an insurance company, risks are independent. Suppose an insurance company provides insurance for a large number of identical households, each of which has an independent 1\% chance in any year of losing 100,000 in a fire. The expected loss for each house is 1\% \times \ 100,000 = \$ 1000. This is the "actuarially fair" insurance premium, in the sense that if the insurance company collects this amount from each household, it will on average be able to pay annual insurance claims. In general insurance will be priced to cover the expected loss, plus costs of doing business, less interest earned on the premium.

However, even with diversification, there is a chance that actual insurance claims in a particular year will exceed 1000 per insured household, in which case the insurance company will not be able to fulfill its promises unless it has access to additional funds. Thus, the seller of a risk-management product—the insurance company—has a risk-management problem of its own—namely to be sure that it can meet its obligations to customers. Meeting such obligations is not just a matter of conscience for management; if there is a significant chance that the insurance company will be bankrupted by claims, there will be no customers in the first place!

Insurance companies have two primary ways to ensure that they meet claims:

1. Capital: Insurance companies hold capital, i.e., a buffer fund in case there is an unusually large number of claims. Because of diversification, for any given bankruptcy probability insurers can use a smaller reserve fund per insured house as the number of insured houses grows. Capital in the form of reserves has traditionally been an important buffer for insurance companies against unexpectedly large claims.
2. Reinsurance: There is always the possibility of a loss that can exceed any fixed amount of capital. An insurance company can in turn buy insurance against large losses, in order to be able to make large payouts if necessary. Insurance for insurance companies is called reinsurance. Insurance companies buy insurance from reinsurance firms to cover the event that claims exceed a certain amount. Reinsurance is a put option: The reinsurance claim gives the insurance company the right to sell to the reinsurers claims that have lost money. Reinsurance does not change the aggregate need for capital, but it does permit further diversification.

# Market-Makers

Now consider again the role of market-makers. Suppose that investors, fearful of a market crash, wish to buy out-of-the-money puts. Out-of-the-money put writers are selling insurance against large market moves. It is precisely when large market moves occur that delta-hedging breaks down. Just like an insurance company, a market-maker requires capital as a cushion against losses. Since capital has a cost, market-makers may also raise the cost of written options that require a disproportionately large commitment of capital per dollar of premium.

Reinsurance for a market-maker would entail buying out-of-the-money put options to move some risk to another market-maker, but ultimately if the financial industry is a net writer of insurance, there must be capital in the event of losses.

The importance of capital and the analogy to insurance becomes more obvious when we consider new derivatives markets. For example, think about weather derivatives. Financial institutions have hedged ski-resort operators against warm winters, soft-drink manufacturers against cold summers, and lawn sprinkler manufacturers against wet summers. Ultimately, there must be a counterparty willing to absorb the risk. If you think about the risks in weather insurance, on a global basis they are like traditional insurance. Weather contracts in the United States can be diversified with weather contracts in Asia, and ultimately the global capital committed to insurance absorbs the reinsurance risk. Global capital markets broadly defined are thus the natural party to absorb these risks.

Some risk, however, is not globally diversifiable. Consider writing puts on the S&P 500. If the U.S. stock market suffers a large decline, other markets around the world are likely to follow. The risk of writing out-of-the-money index puts is one possible explanation for the behavior of implied volatility. Ultimately, it is capital—usually in the form of shareholders willing to absorb risk—that safeguards the financial industry. Delta-hedging plays a key role, but in the end there is always risk that must be absorbed by capital.

# CHAPTER SUMMARY

Market-makers buy and sell to satisfy customer demand. A derivatives market-maker can use the underlying stock to delta-hedge the resulting position. By definition, the return on a delta-hedged position does not depend on the direction in which the stock price moves, but it does depend on the magnitude of the stock price move. A position with zero delta and negative gamma makes money for small stock price moves and loses money for large stock price moves. If the gamma of the position is positive, it makes money for large moves and losses money for small moves. Either way, the delta-hedged position breaks even if the stock moves one standard deviation.

Using a delta-gamma-theta approximation to characterize the change in the value of the delta-hedged portfolio, we can demonstrate that there are three factors that explain the profitability of the portfolio. First, gamma measures the tendency of the portfolio to become unhedged as the stock price moves. Second, theta measures the gain or loss on the portfolio due to the passage of time alone. Third, the market-maker will have interest income or expense on the portfolio.

If we assume that the stock price moves one standard deviation and impose the condition that the market-maker earns zero profit, then a fair option price satisfies a particular relationship among delta, gamma, and theta. This relationship, equation (10), is the foundation of the Black-Scholes option pricing analysis and applies to derivatives in general, not just to calls and puts.

Ultimately, market-making is risky and requires capital. If customers on average buy puts and calls, and if we think of options as insurance, then market-makers are in the same business as insurance companies. This requires capital, since if an extreme event occurs, delta-hedging will fail.
