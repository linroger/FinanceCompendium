# Financial Engineering and Applications

Forwards, swaps, and options (including exotic options) are used as stand-alone financial claims. These claims can be used as financial building blocks to create new claims, and derivatives pricing theory can help us understand corporate financial policy and the valuation of investment projects.

It is possible to construct and price bonds that make payments that, instead of being denominated in cash, are denominated in stocks, commodities, and different currencies. Such bonds can be structured to contain embedded options. Such claims can be used for risk management and their issuance can be motivated by tax and regulatory considerations.
