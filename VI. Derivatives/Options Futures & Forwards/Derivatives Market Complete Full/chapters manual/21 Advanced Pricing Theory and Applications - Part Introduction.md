# Advanced Pricing Theory and Applications

T he standard derivation of the Black-Scholes model of pricing derivatives has two components: an assumption about how the stock price behaves, and the idea that prices are determined by competitive delta-hedging market-makers.

The form of the Black-Scholes model arises from straightforward lognormal probability calculations. The Monte Carlo pricing method is a powerful and flexible technique widely used to price derivatives.

Black and Scholes assumed that stocks follow geometric Brownian motion and used a mathematical tool called Itô's Lemma to solve the problem they posed.
