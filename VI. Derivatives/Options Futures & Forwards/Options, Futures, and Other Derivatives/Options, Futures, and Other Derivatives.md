In the last 40 years, derivatives have become increasingly important in finance. Futures and options are actively traded on many exchanges throughout the world. Many different types of forward contracts, swaps, options, and other derivatives are entered into by financial institutions, fund managers, and corporate treasurers in the over-the-counter market. Derivatives are added to bond issues, used in executive compensation plans, embedded in capital investment opportunities, used to transfer risks in mortgages from the original lenders to investors, and so on. We have now reached the stage where those who work in finance, and many who work outside finance, need to understand how derivatives work, how they are used, and how they are priced.

Whether you love derivatives or hate them, you cannot ignore them! The derivatives market is huge—much bigger than the stock market when measured in terms of underlying assets. The value of the assets underlying outstanding derivatives transactions is several times the world gross domestic product. As we shall see in this chapter, derivatives can be used for hedging or speculation or arbitrage. They can transfer a wide range of risks in the economy from one entity to another.

A derivative involves two parties agreeing to a future transaction. Its value depends on (or derives from) the values of other underlying variables. Very often the variables underlying derivatives are the prices of traded assets. A stock option, for example, is a derivative whose value is dependent on the price of a stock. However, derivatives can be dependent on almost any variable, from the price of hogs to the amount of snow falling at a certain ski resort.

Since the first edition of this book was published in 1988 there have been many developments in derivatives markets. For example:

- Many new instruments such as credit derivatives, electricity derivatives, weather derivatives, and insurance derivatives have been developed.
- Many new types of interest rate, foreign exchange, and equity derivatives now trade.
- There have been many new ideas in risk management and risk measurement.
Real option methods for capital investment appraisal have been developed.
- The financial crisis of 2008 occurred, with derivatives (perhaps unfairly) getting much of the blame.
- Many regulations affecting the over-the-counter derivatives market have been introduced.
- The "risk-free" discount rate used to value derivatives has changed and the decision has been taken to phase out LIBOR.
- Derivatives dealers now adjust the way they price derivatives to allow for credit risks, funding costs, and capital requirements.
- Collateral and credit issues are now given much more attention and have led to changes in the way derivatives are traded.
- Machine learning is now becoming widely used for managing derivatives portfolios.

The book has evolved to keep up to date with these developments. For example: the 2008 financial crisis is discussed in Chapter 8; changes in the interest rates used for derivatives pricing are discussed in Chapter 4; valuation adjustments are covered in Chapter 9; real options are explained in Chapter 36; credit derivatives are covered in Chapter 25; energy, weather, and insurance derivatives are covered in Chapter 35. Machine learning applications are discussed at various points in the book.

In this opening chapter, we take a first look at derivatives markets and how they are changing. We contrast exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives markets and review recent regulatory changes affecting the markets. We describe forward, futures, and options markets and provide examples of how they are used by hedgers, speculators, and arbitrageurs. Later in the book we will elaborate on many of the points made in this chapter.

# 1.1 EXCHANGE-TRADED MARKETS

A derivatives exchange is a market where individuals and companies trade standardized contracts that have been defined by the exchange. Derivatives exchanges have existed for a long time. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was established in 1848 to bring farmers and merchants together. Initially its main task was to standardize the quantities and qualities of the grains that were traded. Within a few years, the first futures-type contract was developed. It was known as a to-arrive contract. Speculators soon became interested in the contract and found trading the contract to be an attractive alternative to trading the grain itself. A rival futures exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), was established in 1919. Now futures exchanges exist all over the world. (See table at the end of the book.) The CME and CBOT have merged to form the CME Group (www.cmegroup.com), which also includes the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), and the Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT).

The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE, www.cboe.com) started trading call option contracts on 16 stocks in 1973. Options had traded prior to 1973, but the CBOE succeeded in creating an orderly market with well-defined contracts. Put option contracts started trading on the exchange in 1977. The CBOE now trades options on thousands of stocks and many different stock indices. Like futures, options have proved to be very popular contracts. Many other exchanges throughout the world now trade options. (See table at the end of the book.) The underlying assets include foreign currencies and futures contracts as well as stocks and stock indices.

Once two traders have agreed to trade a product offered by an exchange, it is handled by the exchange clearing house. This stands between the two traders and manages the risks. Suppose, for example, that trader A enters into a futures contract to buy 100 ounces of gold from trader B in six months for  $1,750 per ounce. The result of this trade will be that A has a contract to buy 100 ounces of gold from the clearing house at$ 1,750 per ounce in six months and B has a contract to sell 100 ounces of gold to the clearing house for 1,750 per ounce in six months. The advantage of this arrangement is that traders do not have to worry about the creditworthiness of the people they are trading with. The clearing house takes care of credit risk by requiring each of the two traders to deposit funds (known as margin) with the clearing house to ensure that they will live up to their obligations. Margin requirements and the operation of clearing houses are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.

# Electronic Markets

Traditionally derivatives exchanges have used what is known as the open outcry system. This involves traders physically meeting on the floor of the exchange, shouting, and using a complicated set of hand signals to indicate the trades they would like to carry out. Exchanges have largely replaced the open outcry system by electronic trading. This involves traders entering their desired trades at a keyboard and a computer being used to match buyers and sellers. The open outcry system has its advocates, but, as time passes, it is becoming less and less used.

Electronic trading has led to a growth in high-frequency trading. This involves the use of algorithms to initiate trades, often without human intervention, and has become an important feature of derivatives markets.

# 1.2 OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS

Not all derivatives trading is on exchanges. Many trades take place in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Banks, other large financial institutions, fund managers, and corporations are the main participants in OTC derivatives markets. Once an OTC trade has been agreed, the two parties can either present it to a central counterparty (CCP) or clear the trade bilaterally. A CCP is like an exchange clearing house. It stands between the two parties to the derivatives transaction so that one party does not have to bear the risk that the other party will default. When trades are cleared bilaterally, the two parties have usually signed an agreement covering all their transactions with each other. The issues covered in the agreement include the circumstances under which outstanding transactions can be terminated, how settlement amounts are calculated in the event of a termination, and how the collateral (if any) that must be posted by each side is calculated. CCPs and bilateral clearing are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.

Large banks often act as market makers for the more commonly traded instruments. This means that they are always prepared to quote a bid price (at which they are prepared to take one side of a derivatives transaction) and an ask price (at which they are prepared to take the other side).

# Business Snapshot 1.1 The Lehman Bankruptcy

On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. This was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history and its ramifications were felt throughout derivatives markets. Almost until the end, it seemed as though there was a good chance that Lehman would survive. A number of companies (e.g., the Korean Development Bank, Barclays Bank in the United Kingdom, and Bank of America) expressed interest in buying it, but none of these was able to close a deal. Many people thought that Lehman was "too big to fail" and that the U.S. government would have to bail it out if no purchaser could be found. This proved not to be the case.

How did this happen? It was a combination of high leverage, risky investments, and liquidity problems. Commercial banks that take deposits are subject to regulations on the amount of capital they must keep. Lehman was an investment bank and not subject to these regulations. By 2007, its leverage ratio had increased to 31:1, which means that a  $3 - 4\%$  decline in the value of its assets would wipe out its capital. Dick Fuld, Lehman's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, encouraged an aggressive deal-making, risk-taking culture. He is reported to have told his executives: "Every day is a battle. You have to kill the enemy." The Chief Risk Officer at Lehman was competent, but did not have much influence and was even removed from the executive committee in 2007. The risks taken by Lehman included large positions in the instruments created from subprime mortgages, which will be described in Chapter 8. Lehman funded much of its operations with short-term debt. When there was a loss of confidence in the company, lenders refused to renew this funding, forcing it into bankruptcy.

Lehman was very active in the over-the-counter derivatives markets. It had over a million transactions outstanding with about 8,000 different counterparties. Lehman's counterparties were often required to post collateral and this collateral had in many cases been used by Lehman for various purposes. Litigation aimed at determining who owes what to whom continued for many years after the bankruptcy filing.

Prior to the financial crisis, which started in 2007 and is discussed in some detail in Chapter 8, OTC derivatives markets were largely unregulated. Following the financial crisis and the failure of Lehman Brothers (see Business Snapshot 1.1), we have seen the development of many new regulations affecting the operation of OTC markets. The main objectives of the regulations are to improve the transparency of OTC markets and reduce systemic risk (see Business Snapshot 1.2). The over-the-counter market in some respects is being forced to become more like the exchange-traded market. Three important changes are:

1. Standardized OTC derivatives between two financial institutions in the United States must, whenever possible, be traded on what are referred to a swap execution facilities (SEFs). These are platforms similar to exchanges where market participants can post bid and ask quotes and where market participants can trade by accepting the quotes of other market participants.
2. There is a requirement in most parts of the world that a CCP be used for most standardized derivatives transactions between financial institutions.
3. All trades must be reported to a central repository.

# Business Snapshot 1.2 Systemic Risk

Systemic risk is the risk that a default by one financial institution will create a "ripple effect" that leads to defaults by other financial institutions and threatens the stability of the financial system. There are huge numbers of over-the-counter transactions between banks. If Bank A fails, Bank B may take a huge loss on the transactions it has with Bank A. This in turn could lead to Bank B failing. Bank C that has many outstanding transactions with both Bank A and Bank B might then take a large loss and experience severe financial difficulties; and so on.

The financial system has survived defaults such as Drexel in 1990 and Lehman Brothers in 2008, but regulators continue to be concerned. During the market turmoil of 2007 and 2008, many large financial institutions were bailed out, rather than being allowed to fail, because governments were concerned about systemic risk.

# Market Size

Both the over-the-counter and the exchange-traded market for derivatives are huge. The number of derivatives transactions per year in OTC markets is smaller than in exchange-traded markets, but the average size of the transactions is much greater. Although the statistics that are collected for the two markets are not exactly comparable, it is clear that the volume of business in the over-the-counter market is much larger than in the exchange-traded market. The Bank for International Settlements (www.bis.org) started collecting statistics on the markets in 1998. Figure 1.1 compares (a) the estimated total principal amounts underlying transactions that were outstanding in the over-the-counter markets between June 1998 and December 2019 and (b) the estimated total value of the assets underlying exchange-traded contracts during the same period. Using these measures, the size of the over-the-counter market in December 2019 was 558.5 trillion and the size of the exchange-traded market was 96.5 trillion.^{1} Figure 1.1 shows that the OTC market grew rapidly up to 2007, but has seen very little net growth since then. One reason for the lack of growth is the popularity of compression. This is a procedure where two or more counterparties restructure transactions with each other with the result that the underlying principal is reduced.

Figure 1.1 Size of over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivatives markets.

In interpreting Figure 1.1, we should bear in mind that the principal underlying an over-the-counter transaction is not the same as its value. An example of an over-the-counter transaction is an agreement to buy 100 million U.S. dollars with British pounds at a predetermined exchange rate in 1 year. The total principal amount underlying this transaction is  $100 million. However, the value of the transaction might be only$ 1 million. The Bank for International Settlements estimates the gross market value of all over-the-counter transactions outstanding in December 2019 to be about 11.6 trillion.[2]

# 1.3 FORWARD CONTRACTS

A relatively simple derivative is a forward contract. It is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time for a certain price. It can be contrasted with a spot contract, which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset almost immediately. A forward contract is traded in the over-the-counter market—usually between two financial institutions or between a financial institution and one of its clients.

One of the parties to a forward contract assumes a long position and agrees to buy the underlying asset on a certain specified future date for a certain specified price. The other party assumes a short position and agrees to sell the asset on the same date for the same price.

Forward contracts on foreign exchange are very popular. Most large banks employ both spot and forward foreign-exchange traders. As we shall see in Chapter 5, there is a relationship between forward prices, spot prices, and interest rates in the two currencies. Table 1.1 provides quotes for the exchange rate between the British pound (GBP) and the U.S. dollar (USD) that might be made by a large international bank on May 21, 2020. The quote is for the number of USD per GBP. The first row indicates that the

Table 1.1 Spot and forward quotes for the exchange rate between USD and GBP on May 21, 2020 (GBP = British pound; USD = U.S. dollar; quote is number of USD per GBP).

<table><tr><td></td><td>Bid</td><td>Ask</td></tr><tr><td>Spot</td><td>1.2217</td><td>1.2220</td></tr><tr><td>1-month forward</td><td>1.2218</td><td>1.2222</td></tr><tr><td>3-month forward</td><td>1.2220</td><td>1.2225</td></tr><tr><td>6-month forward</td><td>1.2224</td><td>1.2230</td></tr></table> bank is prepared to buy GBP (also known as sterling) in the spot market (i.e., for virtually immediate delivery) at the rate of  $1.2217 per GBP and sell sterling in the spot market at$ 1.2220 per GBP. The second, third, and fourth rows indicate that the bank is prepared to buy sterling in 1, 3, and 6 months at  $1.2218,$ 1.2220, and $1.2224 per GBP, respectively, and to sell sterling in 1, 3, and 6 months at $1.2222, $1.2225, and $1.2230 per GBP, respectively.

Forward contracts can be used to hedge foreign currency risk. Suppose that, on May 21, 2020, the treasurer of a U.S. corporation knows that the corporation will pay £1 million in 6 months (i.e., on November 21, 2020) and wants to hedge against exchange rate moves. Using the quotes in Table 1.1, the treasurer can agree to buy £1 million 6 months forward at an exchange rate of 1.2230. The corporation then has a long forward contract on GBP. It has agreed that on November 21, 2020, it will buy £1 million from the bank for $1.2230 million. The bank has a short forward contract on GBP. It has agreed that on November 21, 2020, it will sell £1 million for $1.2230 million. Both sides have made a binding commitment.

# Payoffs from Forward Contracts

Consider the position of the corporation in the trade we have just described. What are the possible outcomes? The forward contract obligates the corporation to buy £1 million for $1,223,000. If the spot exchange rate rose to, say, 1.3000, at the end of the 6 months, the forward contract would be worth $77,000 (= $1,300,000 - $1,223,000) to the corporation. It would enable £1 million to be purchased at an exchange rate of 1.2230 rather than 1.3000. Similarly, if the spot exchange rate fell to 1.2000 at the end of the 6 months, the forward contract would have a negative value to the corporation of $23,000 because it would lead to the corporation paying $23,000 more than the market price for the sterling.

In general, the payoff from a long position in a forward contract on one unit of an asset is

$$
S _ {T} - K
$$ where  $K$  is the delivery price and  $S_{T}$  is the spot price of the asset at maturity of the contract. This is because the holder of the contract is obligated to buy an asset worth  $S_{T}$  for  $K$ . Similarly, the payoff from a short position in a forward contract on one unit of an asset is


$$

K - S _ {T}

$$

These payoffs can be positive or negative. They are illustrated in Figure 1.2. Because it costs nothing to enter into a forward contract, the payoff from the contract is also the trader's total gain or loss from the contract.

In the example just considered,  $K = 1.2230$  and the corporation has a long contract. When  $S_{T} = 1.3000$ , the payoff is  $\0.077$  per £1; when  $S_{T} = 1.2000$ , it is  $-\$ 0.023  per £1.

# Forward Prices and Spot Prices

We shall be discussing in some detail the relationship between spot and forward prices in Chapter 5. For a quick preview of why the two are related, consider a stock that pays no dividend and is worth 60. You can borrow or lend money for 1 year at 5\%. What should the 1-year forward price of the stock be?

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/18ba1d5e04a5ef65838e2b5d0fc39d4e67759797e3a765aeb380100192a10390.jpg)
Figure 1.2 Payoffs from forward contracts: (a) long position, (b) short position. Delivery price  $= K$ ; price of asset at contract maturity  $= S_{T}$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/59466843c583057db5ca75dad44af41c639c5d78d8618f12c82ccec9494b346f.jpg)

The answer is $60 grossed up at 5\% for 1 year, or $63. If the forward price is more than this, say $67, you could borrow $60, buy one share of the stock, and sell it forward for $67. After paying off the loan, you would net a profit of $4 in 1 year. If the forward price is less than $63, say $58, an investor owning the stock as part of a portfolio would sell the stock for $60 and enter into a forward contract to buy it back for $58 in 1 year. The proceeds of investment would be invested at 5\% to earn $3. The investor would end up $5 better off than if the stock were kept in the portfolio for the year.

# 1.4 FUTURES CONTRACTS

Like a forward contract, a futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price. Unlike forward contracts, futures contracts are normally traded on an exchange. To make trading possible, the exchange specifies certain standardized features of the contract. As the two parties to the contract do not necessarily know each other, the exchange clearing house stands between them as mentioned earlier.

Two large exchanges on which futures contracts are traded are the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which have now merged to form the CME Group. On these and other exchanges throughout the world, a very wide range of commodities and financial assets form the underlying assets in the various contracts. The commodities include pork bellies, live cattle, sugar, wool, lumber, copper, aluminum, gold, and tin. The financial assets include stock indices, currencies, and Treasury bonds. Futures prices are regularly reported in the financial press. Suppose that, on September 1, the December futures price of gold is quoted as 1,750. This is the price, exclusive of commissions, at which traders can agree to buy or sell gold for December delivery. It is determined in the same way as other prices (i.e., by the laws of supply and demand). If more traders want to go long than to go short, the price goes up; if the reverse is true, then the price goes down.

Further details on issues such as margin requirements, daily settlement procedures, delivery procedures, bid-ask spreads, and the role of the exchange clearing house are given in Chapter 2.

# 1.5 OPTIONS

Options are traded both on exchanges and in the over-the-counter market. There are two types of option. A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. A put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. The price in the contract is known as the exercise price or strike price; the date in the contract is known as the expiration date or maturity. American options can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date. European options can be exercised only on the expiration date itself. Most of the options that are traded on exchanges are American. In the exchange-traded equity option market, one contract is usually an agreement to buy or sell 100 shares. European options are generally easier to analyze than American options, and some of the properties of an American option are frequently deduced from those of its European counterpart.

It should be emphasized that an option gives the holder the right to do something. The holder does not have to exercise this right. This is what distinguishes options from forwards and futures, where the holder is obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset. Whereas it costs nothing to enter into a forward or futures contract, except for margin requirements which will be discussed in Chapter 2, there is a cost to acquiring an option.

The largest exchange in the world for trading stock options is the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE; www.cboe.com). Table 1.2 gives the bid and ask quotes for some of the call options trading on Apple (ticket symbol: AAPL), on May 21, 2020. Table 1.3 does the same for put options trading on Apple on that date. The quotes are taken from the CBOE website. The Apple stock price at the time of the quotes was bid 316.23, ask 316.50. The bid-ask spread for an option (as a percent of the price) is usually

Table 1.2 Prices of call options on Apple, May 21, 2020; stock price: bid  $316.23, ask$ 316.50 (Source: CBOE).

The option strike prices in Tables 1.2 and 1.3 are  $290,$ 300, $310, $320, $330, and $340. The maturities are June 2020, September 2020, and December 2020. The precise expiration day is the third Friday of the expiration month. The June options expire on June 19, 2020, the September options on September 18, 2020, and the December options on December 18, 2020.


The tables illustrate a number of properties of options. The price of a call option decreases as the strike price increases, while the price of a put option increases as the strike price increases. Both types of option tend to become more valuable as their time to maturity increases. These properties of options will be discussed further in Chapter 11.

Suppose a trader instructs a broker to buy one December call option contract on Apple with a strike price of $340. The broker will relay these instructions to a trader at the CBOE and the deal will be done. The (ask) price indicated in Table 1.2 is $20.30. This is the price for an option to buy one share. In the United States, an option contract is a contract to buy or sell 100 shares. Therefore, the trader must arrange for 2,030 to be remitted to the exchange through the broker. The exchange will then arrange for this amount to be passed on to the party on the other side of the transaction.

In our example, the trader has obtained at a cost of $2,030 the right to buy 100 Apple shares for $340 each. If the price of Apple does not rise above $340 by December 18, 2020, the option is not exercised and the trader loses $2,030. But if Apple does well and the option is exercised when the bid price for the stock is $400, the trader is able to buy 100 shares at $340 and immediately sell them for $400 for a profit of $6,000, or 3,970 when the initial cost of the option contract is taken into account.

An alternative trade would be to sell one September put option contract with a strike price of $290 at the bid price of $12.70. The trader receives 100 × 12.70 = $1,270. If the Apple stock price stays above $290, the option is not exercised and the trader makes a $1,270 profit. However, if stock price falls and the option is exercised when the stock price is $250, there is a loss. The trader must buy 100 shares at $290 when they are worth only $250. This leads to a loss of $4,000, or $2,730 when the initial amount received for the option contract is taken into account.

The stock options trading on the CBOE are American. If we assume for simplicity that they are European, so that they can be exercised only at maturity, the trader's profit as a function of the final stock price for the two trades we have considered is shown in Figure 1.3.

Further details about the operation of options markets and how prices such as those in Tables 1.2 and 1.3 are determined by traders are given in later chapters. At this stage we note that there are four types of participants in options markets:

1. Buyers of calls
2. Sellers of calls
3. Buyers of puts
4. Sellers of puts.

Buyers are referred to as having long positions; sellers are referred to as having short positions. Selling an option is also known as writing the option.

# 1.6 TYPES OF TRADERS

Derivatives markets have been outstandingly successful. The main reason is that they have attracted many different types of traders and have a great deal of liquidity. When a trader wants to take one side of a contract, there is usually no problem in finding someone who is prepared to take the other side.

Three broad categories of traders can be identified: hedgers, speculators, and arbitrageurs. Hedgers use derivatives to reduce the risk that they face from potential future movements in a market variable. Speculators use them to bet on the future direction of a market variable. Arbitrageurs take offsetting positions in two or more instruments to lock in a profit. As described in Business Snapshot 1.3, hedge funds have become big users of derivatives for all three purposes.

In the next few sections, we will consider the activities of each type of trader in more detail.

# Business Snapshot 1.3 Hedge Funds

Hedge funds have become major users of derivatives for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage. They are similar to mutual funds in that they invest funds on behalf of clients. However, they accept funds only from professional fund managers or financially sophisticated individuals and do not publicly offer their securities. Mutual funds are subject to regulations requiring that the shares be redeemable at any time, that investment policies be disclosed, that the use of leverage be limited, and so on. Hedge funds are relatively free of these regulations. This gives them a great deal of freedom to develop sophisticated, unconventional, and proprietary investment strategies. The fees charged by hedge fund managers are dependent on the fund's performance and are relatively high—typically 1 to  $2\%$  of the amount invested plus  $20\%$  of the profits. Hedge funds have grown in popularity, with about 2 trillion being invested in them throughout the world. "Funds of funds" have been set up to invest in a portfolio of hedge funds.

The investment strategy followed by a hedge fund manager often involves using derivatives to set up a speculative or arbitrage position. Once the strategy has been defined, the hedge fund manager must:

1. Evaluate the risks to which the fund is exposed
2. Decide which risks are acceptable and which will be hedged
3. Devise strategies (usually involving derivatives) to hedge the unacceptable risks.

Here are some examples of the labels used for hedge funds together with the trading strategies followed:

Long/Short Equities: Purchase securities considered to be undervalued and short those considered to be overvalued in such a way that the exposure to the overall direction of the market is small.

Convertible Arbitrage: Take a long position in a thought-to-be-undervalued convertible bond combined with an actively managed short position in the underlying equity.

Distressed Securities: Buy securities issued by companies in, or close to, bankruptcy.

Emerging Markets: Invest in debt and equity of companies in developing or emerging countries and in the debt of the countries themselves.

Global Macro: Carry out trades that reflect anticipated global macroeconomic trends.

Merger Arbitrage: Trade after a possible merger or acquisition is announced so that a profit is made if the announced deal takes place.

# 1.7 HEDGERS

In this section we illustrate how hedgers can reduce their risks with forward contracts and options.

# Hedging Using Forward Contracts

Suppose that it is May 21, 2020, and ImportCo, a company based in the United States, knows that it will have to pay  $\pounds 10$  million on August 21, 2020, for goods it has purchased from a British supplier. The GBP/USD exchange rate quotes made by a financial institution are shown in Table 1.1. ImportCo could hedge its foreign exchange risk by buying pounds (GBP) from the financial institution in the 3-month forward market at 1.2225. This would have the effect of fixing the price to be paid to the British exporter at 12,225,000.


Consider next another U.S. company, which we will refer to as ExportCo, that is exporting goods to the United Kingdom and, on May 21, 2020, knows that it will receive £30 million 3 months later. ExportCo can hedge its foreign exchange risk by selling £30 million in the 3-month forward market at an exchange rate of 1.2220. This would have the effect of locking in the U.S. dollars to be realized for the sterling at 36,660,000.

Note that a company might do better if it chooses not to hedge than if it chooses to hedge. Alternatively, it might do worse. Consider ImportCo. If the exchange rate is 1.2000 on August 21 and the company has not hedged, the £10 million that it has to pay will cost $12,000,000, which is less than $12,225,000. On the other hand, if the exchange rate is 1.3000, the £10 million will cost 13,000,000—and the company will wish that it had hedged! The position of ExportCo if it does not hedge is the reverse. If the exchange rate in August proves to be less than 1.2220, the company will wish that it had hedged; if the rate is greater than 1.2220, it will be pleased that it has not done so.

This example illustrates a key aspect of hedging. The purpose of hedging is to reduce risk. There is no guarantee that the outcome with hedging will be better than the outcome without hedging.

# Hedging Using Options

Options can also be used for hedging. Consider an investor who in May of a particular year owns 1,000 shares of a particular company. The share price is 28 per share. The investor is concerned about a possible share price decline in the next 2 months and wants protection. The investor could buy ten July put option contracts on the company's stock with a strike price of 27.50. Each contract is on 100 shares, so this would give the investor the right to sell a total of 1,000 shares for a price of 27.50. If the quoted option price is 1, then each option contract would cost 100 \times 1 = $100 and the total cost of the hedging strategy would be 10 \times 100 = $1,000.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/3de0ce53d1dbab6f12e6a820cc33d821d7ab4ca3d7554eb6bc7c2a30ad1bf9d5.jpg)
Figure 1.4 Value of the stock holding in 2 months with and without hedging.


The strategy costs  $1,000 but guarantees that the shares can be sold for at least$ 27.50 per share during the life of the option. If the market price of the stock falls below $27.50, the options will be exercised, so that $27,500 is realized for the entire holding. When the cost of the options is taken into account, the amount realized is $26,500. If the market price stays above $27.50, the options are not exercised and expire worthless. However, in this case the value of the holding is always above $27,500 (or above $26,500 when the cost of the options is taken into account). Figure 1.4 shows the net value of the portfolio (after taking the cost of the options into account) as a function of the stock price in 2 months. The dotted line shows the value of the portfolio assuming no hedging.

# A Comparison

There is a fundamental difference between the use of forward contracts and options for hedging. Forward contracts are designed to neutralize risk by fixing the price that the hedger will pay or receive for the underlying asset. Option contracts, by contrast, provide insurance. They offer a way for investors to protect themselves against adverse price movements in the future while still allowing them to benefit from favorable price movements. Unlike forwards, options involve the payment of an up-front fee.

# 1.8 SPECULATORS

We now move on to consider how futures and options markets can be used by speculators. Whereas hedgers want to avoid exposure to adverse movements in the price of an asset, speculators wish to take a position in the market. Either they are betting that the price of the asset will go up or they are betting that it will go down.

# Speculation Using Futures

Consider a U.S. curator who in May thinks that the British pound will strengthen relative to the U.S. dollar over the next 2 months and is prepared to back that hunch to the tune of £250,000. One thing the curator can do is purchase £250,000 in the spot market in the hope that the sterling can be sold later at a higher price. (The sterling once purchased would be kept in an interest-bearing account.) Another possibility is to take a long position in four CME July futures contracts on sterling. (Each futures contract is for the purchase of £62,500 in July.) Table 1.4 summarizes the two alternatives on the assumption that the current exchange rate is 1.2220 dollars per pound and the July futures price is 1.2223 dollars per pound. If the exchange rate turns out to be 1.3000 dollars per pound in July, the futures contract alternative enables the curator to realize a profit of  (1.3000 - 1.2223) \times 250,000 = \19,425 . The spot market alternative leads to 250,000 units of an asset being purchased for \1.2220 in May and sold for \1.3000 in July, so that a profit of  (1.3000 - 1.2220) \times 250,000 = \19,500  is made. If the exchange rate falls to 1.2000 dollars per pound, the futures contract gives rise to a  (1.2223 - 1.2000) \times 250,000 = \5,575  loss, whereas the spot market alternative gives

Table 1.4 Speculation using spot and futures contracts. One futures contract is on £62,500. Initial margin on four futures contracts = 20,000.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Possible trades</td></tr><tr><td>Buy £250,000 Spot price = 1.2220</td><td>Buy 4 futures contracts Futures price = 1.2223</td></tr><tr><td>Investment</td><td>$305,500</td><td>$20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Profit if July spot = 1.3000</td><td>$19,500</td><td>$19,425</td></tr><tr><td>Profit if July spot = 1.2000</td><td>-$5,500</td><td>-$5,575</td></tr></table> rise to a loss of  (1.2220 - 1.2000) \times 250,000 = \5,500 . The futures market alternative appears to give rise to slightly worse outcomes for both scenarios. But this is because the calculations do not reflect the interest that is earned or paid.


What then is the difference between the two alternatives? The first alternative of buying sterling requires an up-front investment of 250,000 × 1.2220 = $305,500. In contrast, the second alternative requires only a small amount of cash to be deposited by the speculator in what is termed a "margin account". (The operation of margin accounts is explained in Chapter 2.) In Table 1.4, the initial margin requirement is assumed to be $5,000 per contract, or 20,000 in total. The futures market allows the speculator to obtain leverage. With a relatively small initial outlay, a large speculative position can be taken.

# Speculation Using Options

Options can also be used for speculation. Suppose that it is October and a curator considers that a stock is likely to increase in value over the next 2 months. The stock price is currently  $20, and a 2-month call option with a$ 22.50 strike price is currently selling for $1. Table 1.5 illustrates two possible alternatives, assuming that the curator is willing to invest $2,000. One alternative is to purchase 100 shares; the other involves the purchase of 2,000 call options (i.e., 20 call option contracts). Suppose that the curator's hunch is correct and the price of the stock rises to 27 by December. The first alternative of buying the stock yields a profit of

$$

1 0 0 \times (\$ 2 7 - \$ 2 0) = \$ 7 0 0

$$

However, the second alternative is far more profitable. A call option on the stock with a strike price of $22.50 gives a payoff of $4.50, because it enables something worth 27 to

Table 1.5 Comparison of profits from two alternative strategies for using  $2,000 to speculate on a stock worth$ 20 in October.

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">December stock price</td></tr><tr><td>Speculator&#x27;s strategy</td><td>$15</td><td>$27</td></tr><tr><td>Buy 100 shares</td><td>- $500</td><td>$700</td></tr><tr><td>Buy 2,000 call options</td><td>- $2,000</td><td>$7,000</td></tr></table> be bought for 22.50. The total payoff from the 2,000 options that are purchased under the second alternative is

Figure 1.5 Profit or loss from two alternative strategies for speculating on a stock currently worth 20.


$$

2, 0 0 0 \times \$ 4. 5 0 = \$ 9, 0 0 0

$$

Subtracting the original cost of the options yields a net profit of

$$

\mathbb {S} 9, 0 0 0 - \mathbb {S} 2, 0 0 0 = \mathbb {S} 7, 0 0 0

$$

The options strategy is, therefore, 10 times more profitable than directly buying the stock.

Options also give rise to a greater potential loss. Suppose the stock price falls to 15 by December. The first alternative of buying stock yields a loss of

$$

1 0 0 \times (\$ 2 0 - \$ 1 5) = \$ 5 0 0

$$

Because the call options expire without being exercised, the options strategy would lead to a loss of 2,000— the original amount paid for the options. Figure 1.5 shows the profit or loss from the two strategies as a function of the stock price in 2 months.

Options like futures provide a form of leverage. For a given investment, the use of options magnifies the financial consequences. Good outcomes become very good, while bad outcomes result in the whole initial investment being lost.

# A Comparison

Futures and options are similar instruments for speculators in that they both provide a way in which a type of leverage can be obtained. However, there is an important difference between the two. When a curator uses futures, the potential loss as well as the potential gain is very large. When options are purchased, no matter how bad things get, the curator's loss is limited to the amount paid for the options.

# 1.9 ARBITRAGEURS

Arbitrageurs are a third important group of participants in futures, forward, and options markets. Arbitrage involves locking in a riskless profit by simultaneously entering into transactions in two or more markets. In later chapters we will see how arbitrage is sometimes possible when the futures price of an asset gets out of line with its spot price. We will also examine how arbitrage can be used in options markets. This section illustrates the concept of arbitrage with a very simple example.

Let us consider a stock that is traded on both the New York Stock Exchange (www.nyse.com) and the London Stock Exchange (www.londonstockexchange.com). Suppose that the stock price is  $120 in New York and$ 100 in London at a time when the exchange rate is 1.2300 per pound. An arbitrageur could simultaneously buy 100 shares of the stock in New York and sell them in London to obtain a risk-free profit of

$$

1 0 0 \times [ (\$ 1. 2 3 \times 1 0 0) - \$ 1 2 0 ]

$$ or 300 in the absence of transactions costs. Transactions costs would probably eliminate the profit for a small trader. However, a large investment bank faces very low transactions costs in both the stock market and the foreign exchange market. It would find the arbitrage opportunity very attractive and would try to take as much advantage of it as possible.


Arbitrage opportunities such as the one just described cannot last for long. As arbitrageurs buy the stock in New York, the forces of supply and demand will cause the dollar price to rise. Similarly, as they sell the stock in London, the sterling price will be driven down. Very quickly the two prices will become equivalent at the current exchange rate. Indeed, the existence of profit-hungry arbitrageurs makes it unlikely that a major disparity between the sterling price and the dollar price could ever exist in the first place. Generalizing from this example, we can say that the very existence of arbitrageurs means that in practice only very small arbitrage opportunities are observed in the prices that are quoted in most financial markets. In this book most of the arguments concerning futures prices, forward prices, and the values of option contracts will be based on the assumption that no arbitrage opportunities exist.

# 1.10 DANGERS

Derivatives are very versatile instruments. As we have seen, they can be used for hedging, for speculation, and for arbitrage. It is this very versatility that can cause problems. Sometimes traders who have a mandate to hedge risks or follow an arbitrage strategy become (consciously or unconsciously) speculators. The results can be disastrous. One example of this is provided by the activities of Jérôme Kerviel at Société Général (see Business Snapshot 1.4).

To avoid the sort of problems Société Général encountered, it is very important for both financial and nonfinancial corporations to set up controls to ensure that derivatives are being used for their intended purpose. Risk limits should be set and the activities of traders should be monitored daily to ensure that these risk limits are adhered to.

Unfortunately, even when traders follow the risk limits that have been specified, big mistakes can happen. Some of the activities of traders in the derivatives market during

# Business Snapshot 1.4 SocGen's Big Loss in 2008

Derivatives are very versatile instruments. They can be used for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage. One of the risks faced by a company that trades derivatives is that an employee who has a mandate to hedge or to look for arbitrage opportunities may become a curator.

Jérôme Kerviel joined Société Général (SocGen) in 2000 to work in the compliance area. In 2005, he was promoted and became a junior trader in the bank's Delta One products team. He traded equity indices such as the German DAX index, the French CAC 40, and the Euro Stoxx 50. His job was to look for arbitrage opportunities. These might arise if a futures contract on an equity index was trading for a different price on two different exchanges. They might also arise if equity index futures prices were not consistent with the prices of the shares constituting the index. (This type of arbitrage is discussed in Chapter 5.)

Kerviel used his knowledge of the bank's procedures to speculate while giving the appearance of arbitrating. He took big positions in equity indices and created fictitious trades to make it appear that he was hedged. In reality, he had large bets on the direction in which the indices would move. The size of his unhedged position grew over time to tens of billions of euros.

In January 2008, his unauthorized trading was uncovered by SocGen. Over a three-day period, the bank unwound his position for a loss of 4.9 billion euros. This was at the time the biggest loss created by fraudulent activity in the history of finance. (Later in the year, a much bigger loss from Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme came to light.)

Rogue trader losses were not unknown at banks prior to 2008. For example, in the 1990s, Nick Leeson, who worked at Barings Bank, had a mandate similar to that of Jérôme Kerviel. His job was to arbitrage between Nikkei 225 futures quotes in Singapore and Osaka. Instead he found a way to make big bets on the direction of the Nikkei 225 using futures and options, losing  $1 billion and destroying the 200-year old bank in the process. In 2002, it was found that John Rusnak at Allied Irish Bank had lost$ 700 million from unauthorized foreign exchange trading. The lessons from these losses are that it is important to define unambiguous risk limits for traders and then to monitor what they do very carefully to make sure that the limits are adhered to.

the period leading up to the start of the financial crisis in July 2007 proved to be much riskier than they were thought to be by the financial institutions they worked for. As will be discussed in Chapter 8, house prices in the United States had been rising fast. Most people thought that the increases would continue—or, at worst, that house prices would simply level off. Very few were prepared for the steep decline that actually happened. Furthermore, very few were prepared for the high correlation between mortgage default rates in different parts of the country. Some risk managers did express reservations about the exposures of the companies for which they worked to the U.S. real estate market. But, when times are good (or appear to be good), there is an unfortunate tendency to ignore risk managers and this is what happened at many financial institutions during the 2006-2007 period. The key lesson from the financial crisis is that financial institutions should always be dispassionately asking "What can go wrong?", and they should follow that up with the question "If it does go wrong, how much will we lose?"

# SUMMARY

One of the exciting developments in finance over the last 40 years has been the growth of derivatives markets. In many situations, both hedgers and speculators find it more attractive to trade a derivative on an asset than to trade the asset itself. Some derivatives are traded on exchanges; others are traded by financial institutions, fund managers, and corporations in the over-the-counter market, or added to new issues of debt and equity securities. Much of this book is concerned with the valuation of derivatives. The aim is to present a unifying framework within which all derivatives—not just options or futures—can be valued.

In this chapter we have taken a first look at forward, futures, and option contracts. A forward or futures contract involves an obligation to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price. There are two types of options: calls and puts. A call option gives the holder the right to buy an asset by a certain date for a certain price. A put option gives the holder the right to sell an asset by a certain date for a certain price. Forwards, futures, and options trade on a wide range of different underlying assets.

The success of derivatives can be attributed to their versatility. They can be used by: hedgers, speculators, and arbitrageurs. Hedgers are in the position where they face risk associated with the price of an asset. They use derivatives to reduce or eliminate this risk. Speculators wish to bet on future movements in the price of an asset. They use derivatives to get extra leverage. Arbitrageurs are in business to take advantage of a discrepancy between prices in two different markets. If, for example, they see the futures price of an asset getting out of line with the cash price, they will take offsetting positions in the two markets to lock in a profit.

1.29. In the 1980s, Bankers Trust developed index currency option notes (ICONs). These were bonds in which the amount received by the holder at maturity varied with a foreign exchange rate. One example was its trade with the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. The ICON specified that if the yen/USD exchange rate,  $S_T$ , is greater than 169 yen per dollar at maturity (in 1995), the holder of the bond receives 1,000. If it is less than 169 yen per dollar, the amount received by the holder of the bond is

$$

1, 0 0 0 - \max  \left[ 0, 1, 0 0 0 \left(\frac {1 6 9}{S _ {T}} - 1\right) \right]

$$

# Futures Markets and Central Counterparties

In Chapter 1 we explained that both futures and forward contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a future time for a certain price. A futures contract is traded on an exchange, and the contract terms are standardized by that exchange. A forward contract is traded in the over-the-counter market and can be customized to meet the needs of users.

This chapter covers the details of how futures markets work. We examine issues such as the specification of contracts, the operation of margin accounts, the organization of exchanges, the regulation of markets, the way in which quotes are made, and the treatment of futures transactions for accounting and tax purposes. We explain how some of the ideas pioneered by futures exchanges have been adopted by over-the-counter markets.

# 2.1 BACKGROUND

Examples of large futures exchanges are the CME Group (www.cmgroup.com), the Intercontinental Exchange (www.theice.com), Eurex (www.eurexchange.com), B3, Brazil (www.b3.com.br), the National Stock Exchange of India (www.nse-india .com), the China Financial Futures Exchange (www.cffex.com.cn), and the Tokyo Financial Exchange (www.tfx.co.jp). (See the table at the end of this book for a more complete list.)

We examine how a futures contract comes into existence by considering the corn futures contract traded by the CME Group. On June 5, a trader in New York might call a broker with instructions to buy 5,000 bushels of corn for delivery in September of the same year. The broker would immediately issue instructions to a trader to buy (i.e., take a long position in) one September corn contract. (Each corn contract is for the delivery of exactly 5,000 bushels.) At about the same time, another trader in Kansas might instruct a broker to sell 5,000 bushels of corn for September delivery. This broker would then issue instructions to sell (i.e., take a short position in) one corn contract. A price would be determined and the deal would be done. Under the traditional open outcry system, floor traders representing each party would physically meet to determine the price. With electronic trading, a computer matches the traders.

# Business Snapshot 2.1 The Unanticipated Delivery of a Futures Contract

This story (which may well be apocryphal) was told to the author of this book a long time ago by a senior executive of a financial institution. It concerns a new employee of the financial institution who had not previously worked in the financial sector. One of the clients of the financial institution regularly entered into a long futures contract on live cattle for hedging purposes and issued instructions to close out the position on the last day of trading. (Live cattle futures contracts are traded by the CME Group and each contract is on 40,000 pounds of cattle.) The new employee was given responsibility for handling the account.

When the time came to close out a contract the employee noted that the client was long one contract and instructed a trader at the exchange to buy (not sell) one contract. The result of this mistake was that the financial institution ended up with a long position in two live cattle futures contracts. By the time the mistake was spotted trading in the contract had ceased.

The financial institution (not the client) was responsible for the mistake. As a result, it started to look into the details of the delivery arrangements for live cattle futures contracts—something it had never done before. Under the terms of the contract, cattle could be delivered by the party with the short position to a number of different locations in the United States during the delivery month. Because it was long, the financial institution could do nothing but wait for a party with a short position to issue a notice of intention to deliver to the exchange and for the exchange to assign that notice to the financial institution.

It eventually received a notice from the exchange and found that it would receive live cattle at a location 2,000 miles away the following Tuesday. The new employee was sent to the location to handle things. It turned out that the location had a cattle auction every Tuesday. The party with the short position that was making delivery bought cattle at the auction and then immediately delivered them. Unfortunately the cattle could not be resold until the next cattle auction the following Tuesday. The employee was therefore faced with the problem of making arrangements for the cattle to be housed and fed for a week. This was a great start to a first job in the financial sector!

The trader in New York who agreed to buy has a long futures position in one contract; the trader in Kansas who agreed to sell has a short futures position in one contract. The price agreed to is the current futures price for September corn, say 600 cents per bushel. This price, like any other price, is determined by the laws of supply and demand. If, at a particular time, more traders wish to sell rather than buy September corn, the price will go down. New buyers then enter the market so that a balance between buyers and sellers is maintained. If more traders wish to buy rather than sell September corn, the price goes up. New sellers then enter the market and a balance between buyers and sellers is maintained.

# Closing Out Positions

The vast majority of futures contracts do not lead to delivery. The reason is that most traders choose to close out their positions prior to the delivery period specified in the contract. Closing out a position means entering into the opposite trade to the original one. For example, the New York trader who bought a September corn futures contract on June 5 can close out the position by selling (i.e., shorting) one September corn futures contract on, say, July 20. The Kansas trader who sold (i.e., shorted) a September contract on June 5 can close out the position by buying one September contract on, say, August 25. In each case, the trader's total gain or loss is determined by the change in the futures price between June 5 and the day when the contract is closed out.


Delivery is so unusual that traders sometimes forget how the delivery process works (see Business Snapshot 2.1). Nevertheless, we will review delivery procedures later in this chapter. This is because it is the possibility of final delivery that ties the futures price to the spot price.

# 2.2 SPECIFICATION OF A FUTURES CONTRACT

When developing a new contract, the exchange must specify in some detail the exact nature of the agreement between the two parties. In particular, it must specify the asset, the contract size (exactly how much of the asset will be delivered under one contract), where delivery can be made, and when delivery can be made.

Sometimes alternatives are specified for the grade of the asset that will be delivered or for the delivery locations. As a general rule, it is the party with the short position (the party that has agreed to sell the asset) that chooses what will happen when alternatives are specified by the exchange.2 When the party with the short position is ready to deliver, it files a notice of intention to deliver with the exchange. This notice indicates any selections it has made with respect to the grade of asset that will be delivered and the delivery location.

# The Asset

When the asset is a commodity, there may be quite a variation in the quality of what is available in the marketplace. When the asset is specified, it is therefore important that the exchange stipulate the grade or grades of the commodity that are acceptable. The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has specified the asset in its orange juice futures contract as frozen concentrates that are U.S. Grade A with Brix value of not less than 62.5 degrees.

For some commodities a range of grades can be delivered, but the price received depends on the grade chosen. For example, in the CME Group's corn futures contract, the standard grade is "No. 2 Yellow," but substitutions are allowed with the price being adjusted in a way established by the exchange. No. 1 Yellow is deliverable for 1.5 cents per bushel more than No. 2 Yellow. No. 3 Yellow is deliverable for 2 to 4 cents per bushel less than No. 2 Yellow depending on indicators of quality.

The financial assets in futures contracts are generally well defined and unambiguous. For example, there is no need to specify the grade of a Japanese yen. However, there are some interesting features of the Treasury bond and Treasury note futures contracts traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. For example, the underlying asset in the Treasury bond contract is any U.S. Treasury bond that has a maturity between 15 and 25 years; in the 10-year Treasury note futures contract, the underlying asset is any Treasury note with a maturity of between 6.5 and 10 years. The exchange has a formula for adjusting the price received according to the coupon and maturity date of the bond delivered. This is discussed in Chapter 6.


# The Contract Size

The contract size specifies the amount of the asset that has to be delivered under one contract. This is an important decision for the exchange. If the contract size is too large, many traders who wish to hedge relatively small exposures or who wish to take relatively small speculative positions will be unable to use the exchange. On the other hand, if the contract size is too small, trading may be expensive as there is a cost associated with each contract traded.

The correct size for a contract clearly depends on the likely user. Whereas the value of what is delivered under a futures contract on an agricultural product might be  $10,000 to$ 20,000, it is much higher for some financial futures. For example, under the Treasury bond futures contract traded by the CME Group, instruments with a face value of 100,000 are delivered.

In some cases exchanges have introduced "mini" contracts to attract smaller traders. For example, the CME Group's Mini Nasdaq 100 contract is on 20 times the Nasdaq 100 index, whereas the regular contract is on 100 times the index. (We will cover futures on indices more fully in Chapter 3.)

# Delivery Arrangements

The place where delivery will be made must be specified by the exchange. This is particularly important for commodities that involve significant transportation costs. In the case of the ICE frozen concentrate orange juice contract, delivery is to exchange-licensed warehouses in Florida, New Jersey, or Delaware.

When alternative delivery locations are specified, the price received by the party with the short position is sometimes adjusted according to the location chosen by that party. The price tends to be higher for delivery locations that are relatively far from the main sources of the commodity.

# Delivery Months

A futures contract is referred to by its delivery month. The exchange must specify the precise period during the month when delivery can be made. For many futures contracts, the delivery period is the whole month.

The delivery months vary from contract to contract and are chosen by the exchange to meet the needs of market participants. For example, corn futures traded by the CME Group have delivery months of March, May, July, September, and December. At any given time, contracts trade for the closest delivery month and a number of subsequent delivery months. The exchange specifies when trading in a particular month's contract will begin. The exchange also specifies the last day on which trading can take place for a given contract. Trading generally ceases a few days before the last day on which delivery can be made.


# Price Quotes

The exchange defines how prices will be quoted. For example, crude oil futures prices are quoted in dollars and cents. Treasury bond and Treasury note futures prices are quoted in dollars and thirty-seconds of a dollar.

# Price Limits and Position Limits

For most contracts, daily price movement limits are specified by the exchange. If in a day the price moves down from the previous day's close by an amount equal to the daily price limit, the contract is said to be limit down. If it moves up by the limit, it is said to be limit up. A limit move is a move in either direction equal to the daily price limit. Normally, trading ceases for the day once the contract is limit up or limit down. However, in some instances the exchange has the authority to step in and change the limits.

The purpose of daily price limits is to prevent large price movements from occurring because of speculative excesses. However, limits can become an artificial barrier to trading when the price of the underlying commodity is advancing or declining rapidly. Whether price limits are, on balance, good for futures markets is controversial.

Position limits are the maximum number of contracts that a speculator may hold. The purpose of these limits is to prevent speculators from exercising undue influence on the market.

# 2.3 CONVERGENCE OF FUTURES PRICE TO SPOT PRICE

As the delivery period for a futures contract is approached, the futures price converges to the spot price of the underlying asset. When the delivery period is reached, the futures price equals—or is very close to—the spot price.

To see why this is so, we first suppose that the futures price is above the spot price during the delivery period. Traders then have a clear arbitrage opportunity:

1. Sell (i.e., short) a futures contract
2. Buy the asset
3. Make delivery.

These steps are certain to lead to a profit equal to the amount by which the futures price exceeds the spot price. As traders exploit this arbitrage opportunity, the futures price will fall. Suppose next that the futures price is below the spot price during the delivery period. Companies interested in acquiring the asset will find it attractive to enter into a long futures contract and then wait for delivery to be made. As they do so, the futures price will tend to rise.

The result is that the futures price is very close to the spot price during the delivery period. Figure 2.1 illustrates the convergence of the futures price to the spot price. In Figure 2.1a the futures price is above the spot price prior to the delivery period. In

# 2.4 THE OPERATION OF MARGIN ACCOUNTS

If two traders get in touch with each other directly and agree to trade an asset in the future for a certain price, there are obvious risks. One of the traders may regret the deal and try to back out. Alternatively, the trader simply may not have the financial resources to honor the agreement. One of the key roles of the exchange is to organize trading so that contract defaults are avoided. This is where margin accounts come in.

# Daily Settlement

To illustrate how margin accounts work, we consider a trader who buys (i.e., takes a long position in) two December gold futures contracts. We suppose that the current futures price is  $1,750 per ounce. Because the contract size is 100 ounces, the trader has contracted to buy a total of 200 ounces at this price. The trader has to keep funds in what is known as a margin account. The amount that must be deposited at the time the contract is entered into is known as the initial margin. We suppose this is$ 6,000 per contract, or 12,000 in total. At the end of each trading day, the margin account is adjusted to reflect the trader's gain or loss. This practice is referred to as daily settlement or marking to market.

Suppose, for example, that by the end of the first day the futures price has dropped by $9 from $1,750 to $1,741. The trader has a loss of $1,800 (= 200 × $9), because the 200 ounces of December gold, which the trader contracted to buy at $1,750, can now be sold for only $1,741. The balance in the margin account would therefore be reduced by $1,800 to $10,200. Similarly, if the price of December gold rose to $1,759 by the end of the first day, the balance in the margin account would be increased by  $1,800 to$ 13,800. A trade is first settled at the close of the day on which it takes place. It is then settled at the close of trading on each subsequent day.


Daily settlement leads to funds flowing each day between traders with long positions and traders with short positions. If the futures price increases from one day to the next, funds flow from traders with short positions to traders with long positions. If the futures price decreases from one day to the next, funds flow in the opposite direction, from traders with short positions to traders with long positions. This daily flow of funds between traders to reflect gains and losses is known as variation margin.

Most individuals have to contact their brokers to trade. They are subject to what is termed a maintenance margin. This is somewhat lower than the initial margin. If the balance in the margin account falls below the maintenance margin, the trader receives a margin call and is expected to top up the margin account to the initial margin level within a short period of time. If the trader does not provide this variation margin, the broker closes out the position. In the case of the trader considered earlier, closing out the position would involve neutralizing the existing contract by selling 200 ounces of gold for delivery in December.

If the trader's contract increases in value, the balance in the margin account increases. The trader is entitled to withdraw any balance in the margin account that is in excess of the initial margin.

Table 2.1 Operation of margin account for a long position in two gold futures contracts. The initial margin is  $6,000 per contract, or$ 12,000 in total; the maintenance margin is  $4,500 per contract, or$ 9,000 in total. The contract is entered into on Day 1 at  $1,750 and closed out on Day 16 at$ 1,726.90.

Table 2.1 illustrates the operation of the margin account for one possible sequence of futures prices in the case of the trader considered earlier who buys two gold futures contracts. The maintenance margin is assumed to be  $4,500 per contract, or$ 9,000 in total. On Day 7, the balance in the margin account falls  $1,020 below the maintenance margin level. This drop triggers a margin call from the broker for an additional$ 4,020 to bring the account balance up to the initial margin level of $12,000. It is assumed that the trader provides this margin by the close of trading on Day 8. On Day 11, the balance in the margin account again falls below the maintenance margin level, and a margin call for $3,780 is sent out. The trader provides this margin by the close of trading on Day 12. On Day 16, the trader decides to close out the position by selling two contracts. The futures price on that day is  $1,726.90, and the trader has a cumulative loss of$ 4,620. Note that the trader has excess margin on Days 8, 13, 14, and 15. It is assumed that the excess is not withdrawn.

Most brokers pay traders interest on the balance in a margin account. The balance in the account does not, therefore, represent a true cost, provided that the interest rate is competitive with what could be earned elsewhere. To satisfy the initial margin requirements, but not subsequent margin calls, a trader can usually deposit securities with the broker. Treasury bills are usually accepted in lieu of cash at about  $90\%$  of their market value. Shares are also sometimes accepted in lieu of cash, but at about  $50\%$  of their market value.

Whereas a forward contract is settled at the end of its life, a futures contract is, as we have seen, settled daily. At the end of each day, the trader's gain (loss) is added to (subtracted from) the margin account, bringing the value of the contract back to zero. A futures contract is in effect closed out and rewritten at a new price each day.

Minimum levels for the initial and maintenance margin are set by the exchange clearing house. Individual brokers may require greater margins from their clients than the minimum levels specified by the exchange clearing house. Minimum margin levels are determined by the variability of the price of the underlying asset and are revised when necessary. The higher the variability, the higher the margin levels. The maintenance margin is usually about  $75\%$  of the initial margin.

Note that margin requirements are the same on short futures positions as they are on long futures positions. It is just as easy to take a short futures position as it is to take a long one. The spot market does not have this symmetry. Taking a long position in the spot market involves buying the asset for immediate delivery and presents no problems. Taking a short position involves selling an asset that you do not own. This is a more complex transaction that may or may not be possible in a particular market. It is discussed further in Chapter 5.

# The Clearing House and Its Members

A clearing house acts as an intermediary in futures transactions. It guarantees the performance of the parties to each transaction. The clearing house has a number of members. Brokers who are not members themselves must channel their business through a member and post margin with the member. The main task of the clearing house is to keep track of all the transactions that take place during a day, so that it can calculate the net position of each of its members.

The clearing house member is required to provide to the clearing house initial margin (sometimes referred to as clearing margin) reflecting the total number of contracts that are being cleared. The maintenance margin is set equal to the initial margin. At the end of each day, the transactions being handled by the clearing house member are settled through the clearing house. If in total the transactions have lost money, the member is required to provide variation margin to the exchange clearing house equal to the loss; if there has been a gain on the transactions, the member receives variation margin from the clearing house equal to the gain. Intraday variation margin payments may also be required by a clearing house from its members in times of significant price volatility; if margin requirements are not met, a member is closed out.


In determining margin requirements, the number of contracts outstanding is usually calculated on a net basis rather than a gross basis. This means that short positions the clearing house member is handling for clients are netted against long positions. Suppose, for example, that the clearing house member has two clients: one with a long position in 20 contracts, the other with a short position in 15 contracts. The initial margin would be calculated on the basis of five contracts. The calculation of the margin requirement is usually designed to ensure that the clearing house is about  $99\%$  certain that the margin will be sufficient to cover any losses in the event that the member defaults and has to be closed out. Clearing house members are required to contribute to a guaranty fund. This may be used by the clearing house in the event that a member defaults and the member's margin proves insufficient to cover losses.

# Credit Risk

The whole purpose of the margining system is to ensure that funds are available to pay traders when they make a profit. Overall the system has been very successful. Traders entering into contracts at major exchanges have always had their contracts honored. Futures markets were tested on October 19, 1987, when the S&P 500 index declined by over  $20\%$  and traders with long positions in S&P 500 futures found they had negative margin balances with their brokers. Traders who did not meet margin calls were closed out but still owed their brokers money. Some did not pay and as a result some brokers went bankrupt because, without their clients' money, they were unable to meet margin calls on contracts they entered into on behalf of their clients. However, the clearing houses had sufficient funds to ensure that everyone who had a short futures position on the S&P 500 got paid.

# 2.5 OTC MARKETS

Over-the-counter (OTC) markets, introduced in Chapter 1, are markets where companies agree to derivatives transactions without involving an exchange. Credit risk has traditionally been a feature of OTC derivatives markets. Consider two companies, A and B, that have entered into a number of derivatives transactions. If A defaults when the net value of the outstanding transactions to B is positive, a loss is likely to be taken by B. Similarly, if B defaults when the net value of outstanding transactions to A is positive, a loss is likely to be taken by company A. In an attempt to reduce credit risk, the OTC market has borrowed some ideas from exchange-traded markets. We now discuss this.

# Central Counterparties

We briefly mentioned CCPs in Section 1.2. These are clearing houses for standard OTC transactions that perform much the same role as exchange clearing houses. Members of the CCP, similarly to members of an exchange clearing house, have to provide both initial margin and daily variation margin. Like members of an exchange clearing house, they are also required to contribute to a guaranty fund.

Once an OTC derivative transaction has been agreed between two parties A and B, it can be presented to a CCP. Assuming the CCP accepts the transaction, it becomes the counterparty to both A and B. (This is similar to the way the clearing house of a futures exchange becomes the counterparty to the two sides of a futures trade.) For example, if the transaction is a forward contract where A has agreed to buy an asset from B in one year for a certain price, the clearing house agrees to

1. Buy the asset from B in one year for the agreed price, and
2. Sell the asset to A in one year for the agreed price.

It takes on the credit risk of both A and B.

All members of the CCP are required to provide initial margin to the CCP. Transactions are valued daily and there are daily variation margin payments to or from the member. If an OTC market participant is not itself a member of a CCP, it can arrange to clear its trades through a CCP member. It will then have to provide margin to the CCP member. Its relationship with the CCP member is similar to the relationship between a broker and a futures exchange clearing house member.

Following the financial crisis that started in 2007, regulators have become more concerned about systemic risk (see Business Snapshot 1.2). One result of this, mentioned in Section 1.2, has been legislation requiring that most standard OTC transactions between financial institutions be handled by CCPs.

# Bilateral Clearing

Those OTC transactions that are not cleared through CCPs are cleared bilaterally. In the bilaterally cleared OTC market, two companies A and B usually enter into a master agreement covering all their trades. This agreement usually includes an annex, referred to as the credit support annex or CSA, requiring A or B, or both, to provide collateral. The collateral is similar to the margin required by exchange clearing houses or CCPs from their members.

Collateral agreements in CSAs usually require transactions to be valued each day. A simple two-way agreement between companies A and B might work as follows. If, from one day to the next, the transactions between A and B increase in value to A by X (and therefore decrease in value to B by X), B is required to provide collateral worth X to A. If the reverse happens and the transactions increase in value to B by X (and decrease in value to A by X), A is required to provide collateral worth X to B. (To use the terminology of exchange-traded markets, X is the variation margin provided.) Collateral agreements and the way counterparty credit risk is assessed for bilaterally cleared transactions is discussed further in Chapter 24.

# Business Snapshot 2.2 Long-Term Capital Management's Big Loss

Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund formed in the mid-1990s, always collateralized its bilaterally cleared transactions. The hedge fund's investment strategy was known as convergence arbitrage. A very simple example of what it might do is the following. It would find two bonds, X and Y, issued by the same company that promised the same payoffs, with X being less liquid (i.e., less actively traded) than Y. The market places a value on liquidity. As a result the price of X would be less than the price of Y. LTCM would buy X, short Y, and wait, expecting the prices of the two bonds to converge at some future time.

When interest rates increased, the company expected both bonds to move down in price by about the same amount, so that the collateral it paid on bond X would be about the same as the collateral it received on bond Y. Similarly, when interest rates decreased, LTCM expected both bonds to move up in price by about the same amount, so that the collateral it received on bond X would be about the same as the collateral it paid on bond Y. It therefore expected that there would be no significant outflow of funds as a result of its collateralization agreements.

In August 1998, Russia defaulted on its debt and this led to what is termed a "flight to quality" in capital markets. One result was that investors valued liquid instruments more highly than usual and the spreads between the prices of the liquid and illiquid instruments in LTCM's portfolio increased dramatically. The prices of the bonds LTCM had bought went down and the prices of those it had shorted increased. It was required to post collateral on both. The company experienced difficulties because it was highly leveraged. Positions had to be closed out and LTCM lost about 4 billion. If the company had been less highly leveraged, it would probably have been able to survive the flight to quality and could have waited for the prices of the liquid and illiquid bonds to move back closer to each other.

It has historically been relatively rare for a CSA to require initial margin. This is changing. Starting in 2016, regulations were introduced to require both initial margin and variation margin for bilaterally cleared transactions between financial institutions. The initial margin is posted with a third party.

Collateral significantly reduces credit risk in the bilaterally cleared OTC market (and so the use of CCPs for standard transactions between financial institutions and regulations requiring initial margin for other transactions between financial institutions should reduce risks for the financial system). Collateral agreements were used by hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) for its bilaterally cleared derivatives in the 1990s. The agreements allowed LTCM to be highly levered. They did provide credit protection, but as described in Business Snapshot 2.2, the high leverage left the hedge fund exposed to other risks.

Figure 2.2 illustrates the way bilateral and central clearing work. (It makes the simplifying assumption that there are only eight market participants and one CCP). Under bilateral clearing there are many different agreements between market partici

In practice, because not all OTC transactions are routed through CCPs and there is more than one CCP, the market has elements of both Figure 2.2a and Figure 2.2b.


# Futures Trades vs. OTC Trades

Regardless of how transactions are cleared, initial margin when provided in the form of cash usually earns interest. The daily variation margin provided by a clearing house member for futures contracts does not earn interest. This is because the variation margin constitutes the daily settlement. Transactions in the OTC market, whether cleared through CCPs or cleared bilaterally, are usually not settled daily. For this reason, the daily variation margin that is provided by the member of a CCP or, as a result of a CSA, earns interest when it is in the form of cash.

Securities can be often be used to satisfy margin/collateral requirements. $^6$  The market value of the securities is reduced by a certain amount to determine their value for margin purposes. This reduction is known as a haircut.

# 2.6 MARKET QUOTES

Futures quotes are available from exchanges and several online sources. Table 2.2 is constructed from quotes provided by the CME Group for a number of different commodities on May 21, 2020. Quotes for index, currency, and interest rate futures are given in Chapters 3, 5, and 6, respectively.

The asset underlying the futures contract, the contract size, and the way the price is quoted are shown at the top of each section of Table 2.2. The first asset is gold. The contract size is 100 ounces and the price is quoted as dollars per ounce. The maturity month of the contract is indicated in the first column of the table.

# Prices

The first three numbers in each row of Table 2.2 show the opening price, the highest price in trading so far during the day, and the lowest price in trading so far during the day. The opening price is representative of the prices at which contracts were trading immediately after the start of trading on a day. For the June 2020 gold contract, the opening price on May 21, 2020 was  $1,751.7 per ounce. The highest price during the day was also$ 1,751.7 per ounce and the lowest price during the day was 1,713.3 per ounce.

# Settlement Price

The settlement price is the price used for calculating daily gains and losses and margin requirements. It is usually calculated as the price at which the contract traded immediately before the end of a day's trading session. The fourth number in Table 2.2 shows the settlement price the previous day. The fifth number shows the most recent trading price, and the sixth number shows the price change from the previous day's settlement price. In the case of the June 2020 gold contract, the previous day's settlement price was  $1,752.1. The most recent trade was at$ 1,725.5, $26.6 lower than the previous day's settlement price. If $1,725.5 proved to be the settlement price on May 21, 2020, the margin account of a trader with a long position in one contract would lose 2,660 on May 21, 2020 and the margin account of a trader with a short position in one contract would gain this amount on that date.

# Trading Volume and Open Interest

The final column of Table 2.2 shows the trading volume. The trading volume is the number of contracts traded in a day. It can be contrasted with the open interest, which is the number of contracts outstanding, that is, the number of long positions or, equivalently, the number of short positions.

If there is a large amount of trading by day traders (i.e., traders who enter into a position and close it out on the same day), the volume of trading in a day can be greater than either the beginning-of-day or end-of-day open interest.

# Patterns of Futures

Futures prices can show a number of different patterns. They can increase with the maturity of the futures contract, decrease with the maturity of the futures contract, or show a mixed pattern where the futures price sometimes increases and sometimes decreases with maturity. A futures market where prices increase with maturity is known as a normal market. A futures market where futures prices decrease with maturity is known as an inverted market. Table 2.2 indicates that gold, crude oil, corn, and wheat exhibited a normal market on May 21, 2020 for the range of maturities considered. Soyabean and live cattle exhibit a mixture of the two patterns: normal for some maturity ranges and inverted for others.

# 2.7 DELIVERY

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, very few of the futures contracts that are entered into lead to delivery of the underlying asset. Most are closed out early. Nevertheless, it is the possibility of eventual delivery that determines the futures price. An understanding of delivery procedures is therefore important.

The period during which delivery can be made is defined by the exchange and varies from contract to contract. The decision on when to deliver is made by the party with the short position, whom we shall refer to as trader A. When trader A decides to deliver, trader A's broker issues a notice of intention to deliver to the exchange clearing house. This notice states how many contracts will be delivered and, in the case of commodities, also specifies where delivery will be made and what grade will be delivered. The exchange then chooses a party with a long position to accept delivery.

Suppose that the party on the other side of trader A's futures contract when it was entered into was trader B. It is important to realize that there is no reason to expect that it will be trader B who takes delivery. Trader B may well have closed out his or her position by trading with trader C, trader C may have closed out his or her position by trading with trader D, and so on. The usual rule chosen by the exchange is to pass the notice of intention to deliver on to the party with the oldest outstanding long position. Parties with long positions must accept delivery notices. However, if the notices are transferable, traders with long positions usually have a short period of time to find another party with a long position that is prepared to take delivery in place of them.

In the case of a commodity, taking delivery usually means accepting a warehouse receipt in return for immediate payment. The party taking delivery is then responsible for all warehousing costs. In the case of livestock futures, there may be costs associated with feeding and looking after the animals (see Business Snapshot 2.1). In the case of financial futures, delivery is usually made by wire transfer. For all contracts, the price paid is usually the most recent settlement price. If specified by the exchange, this price is adjusted for grade, location of delivery, and so on.

There are three critical days for a contract. These are the first notice day, the last notice day, and the last trading day. The first notice day is the first day on which a notice of intention to make delivery can be submitted to the exchange. The last notice day is the last such day. The last trading day is generally a few days before the last notice day. To avoid the risk of having to take delivery, a trader with a long position should close out his or her contracts prior to the first notice day.

# Cash Settlement

Some financial futures, such as those on stock indices discussed in Chapter 3, are settled in cash because it is inconvenient or impossible to deliver the underlying asset. In the case of the futures contract on the S&P 500, for example, delivering the underlying asset would involve delivering a portfolio of 500 stocks. When a contract is settled in cash, all outstanding contracts are declared closed on a predetermined day. The final settlement price is set equal to the spot price of the underlying asset at either the open or close of trading on that day. For example, in the S&P 500 futures contract traded by the CME Group, the predetermined day is the third Friday of the delivery month and final settlement is at the opening price on that day.

# 2.8 TYPES OF TRADERS AND TYPES OF ORDERS

There are two main types of traders executing trades: futures commission merchants (FCMs) and locals. FCMs are following the instructions of their clients and charge a commission for doing so; locals are trading on their own account.

Individuals taking positions, whether locals or the clients of FCMs, can be categorized as hedgers, speculators, or arbitrageurs, as discussed in Chapter 1. Speculators can be classified as scalpers, day traders, or position traders. Scalpers are watching for very short-term trends and attempt to profit from small changes in the contract price. They usually hold their positions for only a few minutes. Day traders hold their positions for less than one trading day. They are unwilling to take the risk that adverse news will occur overnight. Position traders hold their positions for much longer periods of time. They hope to make significant profits from major movements in the markets.

# Orders

The simplest type of order placed with a broker is a market order. It is a request that a trade be carried out immediately at the best price available in the market. However, there are many other types of orders. We will consider those that are more commonly used.

A limit order specifies a particular price. The order can be executed only at this price or at one more favorable to the trader. Thus, if the limit price is $30 for a trader wanting to buy, the order will be executed only at a price of $30 or less. There is, of course, no guarantee that the order will be executed at all, because the limit price may never be reached.

A stop order or stop-loss order also specifies a particular price. The order is executed at the best available price once a bid or ask is made at that particular price or a less-favorable price. Suppose a stop order to sell at $30 is issued when the market price is $35. It becomes an order to sell when and if the price falls to 30. In effect, a stop order becomes a market order as soon as the specified price has been hit. The purpose of a stop order is usually to close out a position if unfavorable price movements take place. It limits the loss that can be incurred.

A stop-limit order is a combination of a stop order and a limit order. The order becomes a limit order as soon as a bid or ask is made at a price equal to or less favorable than the stop price. Two prices must be specified in a stop-limit order: the stop price and the limit price. Suppose that at the time the market price is $35, a stop-limit order to buy is issued with a stop price of $40 and a limit price of $41. As soon as there is a bid or ask at $40, the stop-limit becomes a limit order at 41. If the stop price and the limit price are the same, the order is sometimes called a stop-and-limit order.

A market-if-touched (MIT) order is executed at the best available price after a trade occurs at a specified price or at a price more favorable than the specified price. In effect, an MIT becomes a market order once the specified price has been hit. An MIT is also known as a board order. Consider a trader who has a long position in a futures contract and is issuing instructions that would lead to closing out the contract. A stop order is designed to place a limit on the loss that can occur in the event of unfavorable price movements. By contrast, a market-if-touched order is designed to ensure that profits are taken if sufficiently favorable price movements occur.

A discretionary order or market-not-held order is traded as a market order except that execution may be delayed at the broker's discretion in an attempt to get a better price.

Some orders specify time conditions. Unless otherwise stated, an order is a day order and expires at the end of the trading day. A time-of-day order specifies a particular period of time during the day when the order can be executed. An open order or a good-till-canceled order is in effect until executed or until the end of trading in the particular contract. A fill-or-kill order, as its name implies, must be executed immediately on receipt or not at all.

# 2.9 REGULATION

Futures markets in the United States are currently regulated federally by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC; www.cftc.gov), which was established in 1974.

The CFTC looks after the public interest. It is responsible for ensuring that prices are communicated to the public and that futures traders report their outstanding positions if they are above certain levels. The CFTC also licenses all individuals who offer their services to the public in futures trading. The backgrounds of these individuals are investigated, and there are minimum capital requirements. The CFTC deals with complaints brought by the public and ensures that disciplinary action is taken against individuals when appropriate. It has the authority to force exchanges to take disciplinary action against members who are in violation of exchange rules.

With the formation of the National Futures Association (NFA; www.nfa.futures.org) in 1982, some of responsibilities of the CFTC were shifted to the futures industry itself. The NFA is an organization of individuals who participate in the futures industry. Its objective is to prevent fraud and to ensure that the market operates in the best interests of the general public. It is authorized to monitor trading and take disciplinary action when appropriate. The agency has set up an efficient system for arbitrating disputes between individuals and its members.

The Dodd-Frank act, signed into law by President Obama in 2010, expanded the role of the CFTC. For example, it is now responsible for rules requiring that standard over-the-counter derivatives between financial institutions be traded on swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties (see Section 1.2).

# Trading Irregularities

Most of the time futures markets operate efficiently and in the public interest. However, from time to time, trading irregularities do come to light. One type of trading irregularity occurs when a trader group tries to "corner the market." The trader group takes a huge long futures position and also tries to exercise some control over the supply of the underlying commodity. As the maturity of the futures contracts is approached, the trader group does not close out its position, so that the number of outstanding futures contracts may exceed the amount of the commodity available for delivery. The holders of short positions realize that they will find it difficult to deliver and become desperate to close out their positions. The result is a large rise in both futures and spot prices. Regulators usually deal with this type of abuse of the market by increasing margin requirements or imposing stricter position limits or prohibiting trades that increase a speculator's open position or requiring market participants to close out their positions.


# 2.10 ACCOUNTING AND TAX

The full details of the accounting and tax treatment of futures contracts are beyond the scope of this book. A trader who wants detailed information on this should obtain professional advice. This section provides some general background information.

# Accounting

Accounting standards require changes in the market value of a futures contract to be recognized when they occur unless the contract qualifies as a hedge. If the contract does qualify as a hedge, gains or losses are generally recognized for accounting purposes in the same period in which the gains or losses from the item being hedged are recognized. The latter treatment is referred to as hedge accounting.

Consider a company with a December year end. In September 2020 it buys a March 2021 corn futures contract and closes out the position at the end of February 2021. Suppose that the futures prices are 350 cents per bushel when the contract is entered into, 370 cents per bushel at the end of 2020, and 380 cents per bushel when the contract is closed out. The contract is for the delivery of 5,000 bushels. If the contract does not qualify as a hedge, the gains for accounting purposes are

$$

5, 0 0 0 \times (3. 7 0 - 3. 5 0) = \$ 1, 0 0 0

$$ in 2020 and


$$

5, 0 0 0 \times (3. 8 0 - 3. 7 0) = \$ 5 0 0

$$ in 2021. If the company is hedging the purchase of 5,000 bushels of corn in February 2021 so that the contract qualifies for hedge accounting, the entire gain of 1,500 is realized in 2021 for accounting purposes.


The treatment of hedging gains and losses is sensible. If the company is hedging the purchase of 5,000 bushels of corn in February 2021, the effect of the futures contract is to ensure that the price paid (inclusive of the futures gain or loss) is close to 350 cents per bushel. The accounting treatment reflects that this price is paid in 2021.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued FAS 133 and ASC 815 explaining when companies can and cannot use hedge accounting. The International Accounting Standards Board has similarly issued IAS 39 and IFRS 9.

Under the U.S. tax rules, two key issues are the nature of a taxable gain or loss and the timing of the recognition of the gain or loss. Gains or losses are either classified as capital gains or losses or alternatively as part of ordinary income.

For a corporate taxpayer, capital gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, and the ability to deduct losses is restricted. Capital losses are deductible only to the extent of capital gains. A corporation may carry back a capital loss for three years and carry it forward for up to five years. For a noncorporate taxpayer, short-term capital gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, but long-term capital gains are subject to a maximum capital gains tax rate of  $20\%$ . (Long-term capital gains are gains from the sale of a capital asset held for longer than one year; short-term capital gains are the gains from the sale of a capital asset held one year or less.) Taxpayers earning income above certain thresholds pay an additional  $3.8\%$  on all investment income. For a noncorporate taxpayer, capital losses are deductible to the extent of capital gains plus ordinary income up to 3,000 and can be carried forward indefinitely.


Generally, positions in futures contracts are treated as if they are closed out on the last day of the tax year. For the noncorporate taxpayer, this gives rise to capital gains and losses that are treated as if they were  $60\%$  long term and  $40\%$  short term without regard to the holding period. This is referred to as the "60/40" rule. A noncorporate taxpayer may elect to carry back for three years any net losses from the 60/40 rule to offset any gains recognized under the rule in the previous three years.

Hedging transactions are exempt from this rule. The definition of a hedge transaction for tax purposes is different from that for accounting purposes. The tax regulations define a hedging transaction as a transaction entered into in the normal course of business primarily for one of the following reasons:

1. To reduce the risk of price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to property that is held or to be held by the taxpayer for the purposes of producing ordinary income
2. To reduce the risk of price or interest rate changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made by the taxpayer.

A hedging transaction must be clearly identified in a timely manner in the company's records as a hedge. Gains or losses from hedging transactions are treated as ordinary income. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses from hedging transactions generally matches the timing of the recognition of income or expense associated with the transaction being hedged.

# 2.11 FORWARD vs. FUTURES CONTRACTS

The main differences between forward and futures contracts are summarized in Table 2.3. Both contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset for a certain price at a certain future time. A forward contract is traded in the over-the-counter market and there is no standard contract size or standard delivery arrangements. A single delivery date is usually specified and the contract is usually held to the end of its life and then settled. A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on an exchange. A range of delivery dates is usually specified. It is settled daily and usually closed out prior to maturity.

# Profits from Forward and Futures Contracts

Suppose that the sterling exchange rate for a 90-day forward contract is 1.2000 and that this rate is also the futures price for a contract that will be delivered in exactly 90 days. What is the difference between the gains and losses under the two contracts?

Under the forward contract, the whole gain or loss is realized at the end of the life of the contract. Under the futures contract, the gain or loss is realized day by day because of the daily settlement procedures. Suppose that trader A is long £1 million in

Table 2.3 Comparison of forward and futures contracts.

<table><tr><td>Forward</td><td>Futures</td></tr><tr><td>Private contract between two parties</td><td>Traded on an exchange</td></tr><tr><td>Not standardized</td><td>Standardized contract</td></tr><tr><td>Usually one specified delivery date</td><td>Range of delivery dates</td></tr><tr><td>Settled at end of contract</td><td>Settled daily</td></tr><tr><td>Delivery or final cash settlement usually takes place</td><td>Contract is usually closed out prior to maturity</td></tr><tr><td>Some credit risk</td><td>Virtually no credit risk</td></tr></table> a 90-day forward contract and trader B is long £1 million in 90-day futures contracts. (Because each futures contract is for the purchase or sale of £62,500, trader B must purchase a total of 16 contracts.) Assume that the spot exchange rate in 90 days proves to be 1.4000 dollars per pound. Trader A makes a gain of $200,000 on the 90th day. Trader B makes the same gain—but spread out over the 90-day period. On some days trader B may realize a loss, whereas on other days he or she makes a gain. However, in total, when losses are netted against gains, there is a gain of $200,000 over the 90-day period.


# Foreign Exchange Quotes

Both forward and futures contracts trade actively on foreign currencies. However, there is sometimes a difference in the way exchange rates are quoted in the two markets. For example, futures prices where one currency is the U.S. dollar are always quoted as the number of U.S. dollars per unit of the foreign currency or as the number of U.S. cents per unit of the foreign currency. Forward prices are always quoted in the same way as spot prices. This means that, for the British pound, the euro, the Australian dollar, and the New Zealand dollar, the forward quotes show the number of U.S. dollars per unit of the foreign currency and are directly comparable with futures quotes. For other major currencies, forward quotes show the number of units of the foreign currency per U.S. dollar (USD). Consider the Canadian dollar (CAD). A futures price quote of 0.7500 USD per CAD corresponds to a forward price quote of 1.3333 CAD per USD  $(1.3333 = 1 / 0.7500)$ .

# SUMMARY

A very high proportion of the futures contracts that are traded do not lead to the delivery of the underlying asset. Traders usually enter into offsetting contracts to close out their positions before the delivery period is reached. However, it is the possibility of final delivery that drives the determination of the futures price. For each futures contract, there is a range of days during which delivery can be made and a well-defined delivery procedure. Some contracts, such as those on stock indices, are settled in cash rather than by delivery of the underlying asset.

The specification of contracts is an important activity for a futures exchange. The two sides to any contract must know what can be delivered, where delivery can take place, and when delivery can take place. They also need to know details on the trading hours, how prices will be quoted, maximum daily price movements, and so on. New contracts must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before trading starts.

Margin accounts are an important aspect of futures markets. A trader keeps a margin account with his or her broker. The account is adjusted daily to reflect gains or losses, and from time to time the broker may require the account to be topped up if adverse price movements have taken place. The broker either must be a clearing house member or must maintain a margin account with a clearing house member. Each clearing house member maintains a margin account with the exchange clearing house. The balance in the account is adjusted daily to reflect gains and losses on the business for which the clearing house member is responsible.

In over-the-counter derivatives markets, transactions are cleared either bilaterally or centrally. When bilateral clearing is used, collateral frequently has to be posted by one or both parties to reduce credit risk. When central clearing is used, a central counterparty (CCP) stands between the two sides. It requires each side to provide margin and performs much the same function as an exchange clearing house.

Forward contracts differ from futures contracts in a number of ways. Forward contracts are private arrangements between two parties, whereas futures contracts are traded on exchanges. There is generally a single delivery date in a forward contract, whereas futures contracts frequently involve a range of such dates. Because they are not traded on exchanges, forward contracts do not need to be standardized. A forward contract is not usually settled until the end of its life, and most contracts do in fact lead to delivery of the underlying asset or a cash settlement at this time.

In the next few chapters we shall examine in more detail the ways in which forward and futures contracts can be used for hedging. We shall also look at how forward and futures prices are determined.

# Hedging Strategies Using Futures

Many of the participants in futures markets are hedgers. Their aim is to use futures markets to reduce a particular risk that they face. This risk might relate to fluctuations in the price of oil, a foreign exchange rate, the level of the stock market, or some other variable. A perfect hedge is one that completely eliminates the risk. Perfect hedges are rare. For the most part, therefore, a study of hedging using futures contracts is a study of the ways in which hedges can be constructed so that they perform as close to perfectly as possible.

In this chapter we consider a number of general issues associated with the way hedges are set up. When is a short futures position appropriate? When is a long futures position appropriate? Which futures contract should be used? What is the optimal size of the futures position for reducing risk? At this stage, we restrict our attention to what might be termed hedge-and-forget strategies. We assume that no attempt is made to adjust the hedge once it has been put in place. The hedger simply takes a futures position at the beginning of the life of the hedge and closes out the position at the end of the life of the hedge. In Chapter 19 we will examine dynamic hedging strategies in which the hedge is monitored closely and frequent adjustments are made.

The chapter initially treats futures contracts as forward contracts (that is, it ignores daily settlement). Later it explains adjustments that are necessary to take account of the difference between futures and forwards.

# 3.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES

When an individual or company chooses to use futures markets to hedge a risk, the objective is often to take a position that neutralizes the risk as far as possible. Consider a company that knows it will gain $10,000 for each 1 cent increase in the price of a commodity over the next 3 months and lose $10,000 for each 1 cent decrease in the price during the same period. To hedge, the company's treasurer should take a short futures position that is designed to offset this risk. The futures position should lead to a loss of $10,000 for each 1 cent increase in the price of the commodity over the 3 months and a gain of $10,000 for each 1 cent decrease in the price during this period. If the price of the commodity goes down, the gain on the futures position offsets the loss on the rest of the company's business. If the price of the commodity goes up, the loss on the futures position is offset by the gain on the rest of the company's business.


# Short Hedges

A short hedge is a hedge, such as the one just described, that involves a short position in futures contracts. A short hedge is appropriate when the hedger already owns an asset and expects to sell it at some time in the future. For example, a short hedge could be used by a farmer who owns some hogs and knows that they will be ready for sale at the local market in two months. A short hedge can also be used when an asset is not owned right now but will be owned and ready for sale at some time in the future. Consider, for example, a U.S. exporter who knows that he or she will receive euros in 3 months. The exporter will realize a gain if the euro increases in value relative to the U.S. dollar and will sustain a loss if the euro decreases in value relative to the U.S. dollar. A short futures position leads to a loss if the euro increases in value and a gain if it decreases in value. It has the effect of offsetting the exporter's risk.

To provide a more detailed illustration of the operation of a short hedge in a specific situation, we assume that it is May 15 today and that an oil producer has just negotiated a contract to sell 1 million barrels of crude oil. It has been agreed that the price that will apply in the contract is the market price on August 15. The oil producer is therefore in the position where it will gain  $10,000 for each 1 cent increase in the price of oil over the next 3 months and lose$ 10,000 for each 1 cent decrease in the price during this period. Suppose that on May 15 the spot price is $50 per barrel and the crude oil futures price for August delivery is $49 per barrel. Because each futures contract is for the delivery of 1,000 barrels, the company can hedge its exposure by shorting (i.e., selling) 1,000 futures contracts. If the oil producer closes out its position on August 15, the effect of the strategy should be to lock in a price close to 49 per barrel.

To illustrate what might happen, suppose that the spot price on August 15 proves to be $45 per barrel. The company realizes $45 million for the oil under its sales contract. Because August is the delivery month for the futures contract, the futures price on August 15 should be very close to the spot price of 45 on that date. The company therefore gains approximately

$$

\$ 49 - \$ 45 = \$ 4

$$ per barrel, or  $4 million in total from the short futures position. The total amount realized from both the futures position and the sales contract is therefore approximately$ 49 per barrel, or 49 million in total.

For an alternative outcome, suppose that the price of oil on August 15 proves to be  $55 per barrel. The company realizes$ 55 per barrel for the oil and loses approximately

$$
\$ 55 - \$ 49 = \$ 6
$$ per barrel on the short futures position. Again, the total amount realized is approximately  $49 million. It is easy to see that in all cases the company ends up with approximately$ 49 million.


# Long Hedges

Hedges that involve taking a long position in a futures contract are known as long hedges. A long hedge is appropriate when a company knows it will have to purchase a certain asset in the future and wants to lock in a price now.

Suppose that it is now January 15. A copper fabricator knows it will require 100,000 pounds of copper on May 15 to meet a certain contract. The spot price of copper is 340 cents per pound, and the futures price for May delivery is 320 cents per pound. The fabricator can hedge its position by taking a long position in four futures contracts offered by the CME Group and closing its position on May 15. Each contract is for the delivery of 25,000 pounds of copper. The strategy has the effect of locking in the price of the required copper at close to 320 cents per pound.

Suppose that the spot price of copper on May 15 proves to be 325 cents per pound. Because May is the delivery month for the futures contract, this should be very close to the futures price. The fabricator therefore gains approximately

$$

1 0 0, 0 0 0 \times (\$ 3. 2 5 - \$ 3. 2 0) = \$ 5, 0 0 0

$$ on the futures contracts. It pays 100,000 × $3.25 = $325,000 for the copper, making the net cost approximately $325,000 - $5,000 = 320,000. For an alternative outcome, suppose that the spot price is 305 cents per pound on May 15. The fabricator then loses approximately

$$
1 0 0, 0 0 0 \times (\$ 3. 2 0 - \$ 3. 0 5) = \$ 1 5, 0 0 0
$$ on the futures contract and pays 100,000 × $3.05 = $305,000 for the copper. Again, the net cost is approximately 320,000, or 320 cents per pound.


Note that, in this case, it is clearly better for the company to use futures contracts than to buy the copper on January 15 in the spot market. If it does the latter, it will pay 340 cents per pound instead of 320 cents per pound and will incur both interest costs and storage costs. For a company using copper on a regular basis, this disadvantage would be offset by the convenience of having the copper on hand. However, for a company that knows it will not require the copper until May 15, the futures contract alternative is likely to be preferred.

The examples we have looked at assume that the futures position is closed out in the delivery month. The hedge has the same basic effect if delivery is allowed to happen. However, making or taking delivery can be costly and inconvenient. For this reason, delivery is not usually made even when the hedger keeps the futures contract until the delivery month. As will be discussed later, hedgers with long positions usually avoid any possibility of having to take delivery by closing out their positions before the delivery period.

We have also assumed in the two examples that there is no daily settlement. In practice, daily settlement does have a small effect on the performance of a hedge. As explained in Chapter 2, it means that the payoff from the futures contract is realized day by day throughout the life of the hedge rather than all at the end.

# 3.2 ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST HEDGING

The arguments in favor of hedging are so obvious that they hardly need to be stated. Most nonfinancial companies are in the business of manufacturing, or retailing or wholesaling, or providing a service. They have no particular skills or expertise in predicting variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices.

(Indeed, even experts are often wrong when they make predictions about these variables.) It makes sense for them to hedge the risks associated with these variables as they become aware of them. The companies can then focus on their main activities. By hedging, they avoid unpleasant surprises such as sharp rises in the price of a commodity that is being purchased.

In practice, many risks are left unhedged. In the rest of this section we will explore some of the reasons for this.

# Hedging and Shareholders

One argument sometimes put forward is that the shareholders can, if they wish, do the hedging themselves. They do not need the company to do it for them. This argument is, however, open to question. It assumes that shareholders have as much information as the company's management about the risks faced by a company. In most instances, this is not the case. The argument also ignores commissions and other transactions costs. These are less expensive per dollar of hedging for large transactions than for small transactions. Hedging is therefore likely to be less expensive when carried out by the company than when it is carried out by individual shareholders.

One thing that shareholders can do far more easily than a corporation is diversify risk. A shareholder with a well-diversified portfolio may be immune to many of the risks faced by a corporation. For example, in addition to holding shares in a company that uses copper, a well-diversified shareholder may hold shares in a copper producer, so that there is very little overall exposure to the price of copper. If companies are acting in the best interests of well-diversified shareholders, it can be argued that hedging is unnecessary in many situations. However, the extent to which managers are in practice influenced by this type of argument is open to question.

# Hedging and Competitors

If hedging is not the norm in a certain industry, it may not make sense for one particular company to choose to be different from all others. Competitive pressures within the industry may be such that the prices of the goods and services produced by the industry fluctuate to reflect raw material costs, interest rates, exchange rates, and so on. A company that does not hedge can expect its profit margins to be roughly constant. However, a company that does hedge can expect its profit margins to fluctuate!

To illustrate this point, consider two manufacturers of gold jewelry, SafeandSure Company and TakeaChance Company. We assume that most companies in the industry do not hedge against movements in the price of gold and that TakeaChance Company is no exception. However, SafeandSure Company has decided to be different from its competitors and to use futures contracts to hedge its purchase of gold over the next 18 months. If the price of gold goes up, economic pressures will tend to lead to a corresponding increase in the wholesale price of jewelry, so that TakeaChance Company's gross profit margin is unaffected. By contrast, SafeandSure Company's profit margin will increase after the effects of the hedge have been taken into account. If the price of gold goes down, economic pressures will tend to lead to a corresponding decrease in the wholesale price of jewelry. Again, TakeaChance Company's profit margin is unaffected. However, SafeandSure Company's profit margin goes down. In extreme conditions,

Table 3.1 Danger in hedging when competitors do not hedge.

<table><tr><td>Change in gold price</td><td>Effect on price of
gold jewelry</td><td>Effect on profits of
TakeaChance Co.</td><td>Effect on profits of
SafeandSure Co.</td></tr><tr><td>Increase</td><td>Increase</td><td>None</td><td>Increase</td></tr><tr><td>Decrease</td><td>Decrease</td><td>None</td><td>Decrease</td></tr></table>

SafeandSure Company's profit margin could become negative as a result of the "hedging" carried out! The situation is summarized in Table 3.1.

This example emphasizes the importance of looking at the big picture when hedging. All the implications of price changes on a company's profitability should be taken into account in the design of a hedging strategy to protect against the price changes.

# Hedging Can Lead to a Worse Outcome

It is important to realize that a hedge using futures contracts can result in a decrease or an increase in a company's profits relative to the position it would be in with no hedging. In the example involving the oil producer considered earlier, if the price of oil goes down, the company loses money on its sale of 1 million barrels of oil, and the futures position leads to an offsetting gain. The treasurer can be congratulated for having had the foresight to put the hedge in place. Clearly, the company is better off than it would be with no hedging. Other executives in the organization, it is hoped, will appreciate the contribution made by the treasurer. If the price of oil goes up, the company gains from its sale of the oil, and the futures position leads to an offsetting loss. The company is in a worse position than it would be with no hedging. Although the hedging decision was perfectly logical, the treasurer may in practice have a difficult time justifying it. Suppose that the price of oil at the end of the hedge is $59, so that the company loses $10 per barrel on the futures contract. We can imagine a conversation such as the following between the treasurer and the president:

President: This is terrible. We've lost 10 million in the futures market in the space of three months. How could it happen? I want a full explanation.

Treasurer: The purpose of the futures contracts was to hedge our exposure to the price of oil, not to make a profit. Don't forget we made 10 million from the favorable effect of the oil price increases on our business.

President: What's that got to do with it? That's like saying that we do not need to worry when our sales are down in California because they are up in New York.

Treasurer: If the price of oil had gone down ...

President: I don't care what would have happened if the price of oil had gone down. The fact is that it went up. I really do not know what you were doing playing the futures markets like this. Our shareholders will expect us to have done particularly well this quarter. I'm going to have to explain to them that your actions reduced profits by 10 million. I'm afraid this is going to mean no bonus for you this year.

# Business Snapshot 3.1 Hedging by Gold Mining Companies

It is natural for a gold mining company to consider hedging against changes in the price of gold. Typically it takes several years to extract all the gold from a mine. Once a gold mining company decides to go ahead with production at a particular mine, it has a big exposure to the price of gold. Indeed a mine that looks profitable at the outset could become unprofitable if the price of gold plunges.

Gold mining companies are careful to explain their hedging strategies to potential shareholders. Some gold mining companies do not hedge. They tend to attract shareholders who buy gold stocks because they want to benefit when the price of gold increases and are prepared to accept the risk of a loss from a decrease in the price of gold. Other companies choose to hedge. They estimate the number of ounces of gold they will produce each month for the next few years and enter into short futures or forward contracts to lock in the price for all or part of this.

Suppose you are Goldman Sachs and are approached by a gold mining company that wants to sell you a large amount of gold in 1 year at a fixed price. How do you set the price and then hedge your risk? The answer is that you can hedge by borrowing the gold from a central bank, selling it immediately in the spot market, and investing the proceeds at the risk-free rate. At the end of the year, you buy the gold from the gold mining company and use it to repay the central bank. The fixed forward price you set for the gold reflects the risk-free rate you can earn and the lease rate you pay the central bank for borrowing the gold.

Treasurer: That's unfair. I was only ...

President: Unfair! You are lucky not to be fired. You lost 10 million.

Treasurer: It all depends on how you look at it...

It is easy to see why many treasurers are reluctant to hedge! Hedging reduces risk for the company. However, it may increase risk for the treasurer if others do not fully understand what is being done. The only real solution to this problem involves ensuring that all senior executives within the organization fully understand the nature of hedging before a hedging program is put in place. Ideally, hedging strategies are set by a company's board of directors and are clearly communicated to both the company's management and the shareholders. (See Business Snapshot 3.1 for a discussion of hedging by gold mining companies.)

# 3.3 BASIS RISK

The hedges in the examples considered so far have been almost too good to be true. The hedger was able to identify the precise date in the future when an asset would be bought or sold. The hedger was then able to use futures contracts to remove almost all the risk arising from the price of the asset on that date. In practice, hedging is often not quite as straightforward as this. Some of the reasons are as follows:

1. The asset whose price is to be hedged may not be exactly the same as the asset underlying the futures contract.

2. There may be uncertainty as to the exact date when the asset will be bought or sold.
3. The hedge may require the futures contract to be closed out before its delivery month.

These problems give rise to what is termed basis risk. This concept will now be explained.

# The Basis

The basis in a hedging situation is as follows:2

Basis  $=$  Spot price of asset to be hedged - Futures price of contract used

If the asset to be hedged and the asset underlying the futures contract are the same, the basis should be zero at the expiration of the futures contract. Prior to expiration, the basis may be positive or negative.

As time passes, the spot price and the futures price for a particular month do not necessarily change by the same amount. As a result, the basis changes. An increase in the basis is referred to as a strengthening of the basis; a decrease in the basis is referred to as a weakening of the basis. Figure 3.1 illustrates how a basis might change over time in a situation where the basis is positive prior to expiration of the futures contract.

To examine the nature of basis risk, we will use the following notation:

$S_{1}$ : Spot price at time  $t_{1}$
$S_{2}$ : Spot price at time  $t_{2}$
$F_{1}$ : Futures price at time  $t_{1}$
$F_{2}$  : Futures price at time  $t_2$
$b_{1}$  : Basis at time  $t_1$
$b_{2}$  : Basis at time  $t_2$

We will assume that a hedge is put in place at time  $t_1$  and closed out at time  $t_2$ . As an example, we will consider the case where the spot and futures prices at the time the hedge is initiated are $2.50 and $2.20, respectively, and that at the time the hedge is closed out they are $2.00 and $1.90, respectively. This means that S₁ = 2.50, F₁ = 2.20, S₂ = 2.00, and F₂ = 1.90.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/db3acda644d2cd1d98b0ec12746a45ec0825740dbb09903d31bfc14be5828ed3.jpg)
Figure 3.1 Variation of basis over time.


From the definition of the basis, we have

$$ b _ {1} = S _ {1} - F _ {1} \quad \text {a n d} \quad b _ {2} = S _ {2} - F _ {2}
$$ so that, in our example,  $b_{1} = 0.30$  and  $b_{2} = 0.10$ .


Consider first the situation of a hedger who knows that the asset will be sold at time  $t_2$  and takes a short futures position at time  $t_1$ . The price realized for the asset is  $S_2$  and the profit on the futures position is  $F_1 - F_2$ . The effective price that is obtained for the asset with hedging is therefore

$$

S _ {2} + F _ {1} - F _ {2} = F _ {1} + b _ {2}

$$

In our example, this is 2.30. The value of F_1 is known at time t_1. If b_2 were also known at this time, a perfect hedge would result. The hedging risk is the uncertainty associated with b_2 and is known as basis risk. Consider next a situation where a company knows it will buy the asset at time t_2 and initiates a long hedge at time t_1. The price paid for the asset is S_2 and the loss on the hedge is F_1 - F_2. The effective price that is paid with hedging is therefore

$$

S _ {2} + F _ {1} - F _ {2} = F _ {1} + b _ {2}

$$

This is the same expression as before and is 2.30 in the example. The value of F1 is known at time t1, and the term b2 represents basis risk.

Note that basis changes can lead to an improvement or a worsening of a hedger's position. Consider a company that uses a short hedge because it plans to sell the underlying asset. If the basis strengthens (i.e., increases) unexpectedly, the company's position improves because it will get a higher price for the asset after futures gains or losses are considered; if the basis weakens (i.e., decreases) unexpectedly, the company's position worsens. For a company using a long hedge because it plans to buy the asset, the reverse holds. If the basis strengthens unexpectedly, the company's position worsens because it will pay a higher price for the asset after futures gains or losses are considered; if the basis weakens unexpectedly, the company's position improves.

The asset that gives rise to the hedger's exposure is sometimes different from the asset underlying the futures contract that is used for hedging. This is known as cross hedging and is discussed in the next section. It leads to an increase in basis risk. Define  $S_2^*$  as the price of the asset underlying the futures contract at time  $t_2$ . As before,  $S_2$  is the price of the asset being hedged at time  $t_2$ . By hedging, a company ensures that the price that will be paid (or received) for the asset is

$$

S _ {2} + F _ {1} - F _ {2}

$$

This can be written as

$$

F _ {1} + \left(S _ {2} ^ {*} - F _ {2}\right) + \left(S _ {2} - S _ {2} ^ {*}\right)

$$

The terms  $S_2^* - F_2$  and  $S_2 - S_2^*$  represent the two components of the basis. The  $S_2^* - F_2$  term is the basis that would exist if the asset being hedged were the same as the asset underlying the futures contract. The  $S_2 - S_2^*$  term is the basis arising from the difference between the two assets.

# Choice of Contract

One key factor affecting basis risk is the choice of the futures contract to be used for hedging. This choice has two components:

1. The choice of the asset underlying the futures contract
2. The choice of the delivery month.

If the asset being hedged exactly matches an asset underlying a futures contract, the first choice is generally fairly easy. In other circumstances, it is necessary to carry out a careful analysis to determine which of the available futures contracts has futures prices that are most closely correlated with the price of the asset being hedged.

The choice of the delivery month is likely to be influenced by several factors. In the examples given earlier in this chapter, we assumed that, when the expiration of the hedge corresponds to a delivery month, the contract with that delivery month is chosen. In fact, a contract with a later delivery month is usually chosen in these circumstances. The reason is that futures prices are in some instances quite erratic during the delivery month. Moreover, a long hedger runs the risk of having to take delivery of the physical asset if the contract is held during the delivery month. Taking delivery can be expensive and inconvenient. (Long hedgers normally prefer to close out the futures contract and buy the asset from their usual suppliers.)

In general, basis risk increases as the time difference between the hedge expiration and the delivery month increases. A good rule of thumb is therefore to choose a delivery month that is as close as possible to, but later than, the expiration of the hedge. Suppose delivery months are March, June, September, and December for a futures contract on a particular asset. For hedge expirations in December, January, and February, the March contract will be chosen; for hedge expirations in March, April, and May, the June contract will be chosen; and so on. This rule of thumb assumes that there is sufficient liquidity in all contracts to meet the hedger's requirements. In practice, liquidity tends to be greatest in short-maturity futures contracts. Therefore, in some situations, the hedger may be inclined to use short-maturity contracts and roll them forward. This strategy is discussed later in the chapter.

# Example 3.1

It is March 1. A U.S. company expects to receive 50 million Japanese yen at the end of July. Yen futures contracts on the CME Group have delivery months of March, June, September, and December. One contract is for the delivery of 12.5 million yen. The company therefore shorts four September yen futures contracts on March 1. When the yen are received at the end of July, the company closes out its position. We suppose that the futures price on March 1 in cents per yen is 1.0800 and that the spot and futures prices when the contract is closed out are 1.0200 and 1.0250, respectively.

The gain on the futures contract is  $1.0800 - 1.0250 = 0.0550$  cents per yen. The basis is  $1.0200 - 1.0250 = -0.0050$  cents per yen when the contract is closed out. The effective price obtained in cents per yen is the final spot price plus the gain on the futures:

$$
1. 0 2 0 0 + 0. 0 5 5 0 = 1. 0 7 5 0
$$

This can also be written as the initial futures price plus the final basis:

$$
2. 0 8 0 0 + (- 0. 0 0 5 0) = 1. 0 7 5 0
$$

The total amount received by the company for the 50 million yen is  $50 \times 0.01075$  million dollars, or 537,500.

# Example 3.2

It is June 8 and a company knows that it will need to purchase 20,000 barrels of crude oil at some time in October or November. Oil futures contracts are currently traded for delivery every month by the CME Group and the contract size is 1,000 barrels. The company therefore decides to use the December contract for hedging and takes a long position in 20 December contracts. The futures price on June 8 is  $48.00 per barrel. The company finds that it is ready to purchase the crude oil on November 10. It therefore closes out its futures contract on that date. The spot price and futures price on November 10 are$ 50.00 per barrel and 49.10 per barrel.

The gain on the futures contract is 49.10 - 48.00 = \1.10$ per barrel. The basis when the contract is closed out is 50.00 - 49.10 = \0.90 per barrel. The effective price paid (in dollars per barrel) is the final spot price less the gain on the futures, or

$$

5 0. 0 0 - 1. 1 0 = 4 8. 9 0

$$

This can also be calculated as the initial futures price plus the final basis,

$$

4 8. 0 0 + 0. 9 0 = 4 8. 9 0

$$

The total price paid is 48.90 \times 20,000 = \978,000.

# 3.4 CROSS HEDGING

In Examples 3.1 and 3.2, the asset underlying the futures contract was the same as the asset whose price is being hedged. Cross hedging occurs when the two assets are different. Consider, for example, an airline that is concerned about the future price of jet fuel. Because jet fuel futures are not actively traded, it might choose to use heating oil futures contracts to hedge its exposure.

The hedge ratio is the ratio of the size of the position taken in futures contracts to the size of the exposure. When the asset underlying the futures contract is the same as the asset being hedged, it is natural to use a hedge ratio of 1.0. This is the hedge ratio we have used in the examples considered so far. For instance, in Example 3.2, the hedger's exposure was on 20,000 barrels of oil, and futures contracts were entered into for the delivery of exactly this amount of oil.

When cross hedging is used, setting the hedge ratio equal to 1.0 is not always optimal. The hedger should choose a value for the hedge ratio that minimizes the variance of the value of the hedged position. We now consider how the hedger can do this.

# Calculating the Minimum Variance Hedge Ratio

We first present an analysis assuming no daily settlement of futures contracts. The minimum variance hedge ratio depends on the relationship between changes in the spot price and changes in the futures price. Define:

$\Delta S$ : Change in spot price,  $S$ , during a period of time equal to the life of the hedge

$\Delta F$ : Change in futures price,  $F$ , during a period of time equal to the life of the hedge.

If we assume that the relationship between  $\Delta S$  and  $\Delta F$  is approximately linear (see Figure 3.2), we can write:

$$

\Delta S = a + b \Delta F + \epsilon

$$ where  $a$  and  $b$  are constants and  $\epsilon$  is an error term. Suppose that the hedge ratio is  $h$  (i.e., a percentage  $h$  of the exposure to  $S$  is hedged with futures). Then the change in the value of the position per unit of exposure to  $S$  is

$$
\Delta S - h \Delta F = a + (b - h) \Delta F + \epsilon
$$

The standard deviation of this is minimized by setting  $h = b$  (so that the second term on the right-hand side disappears).

Denote the minimum variance hedge ratio by  $h^*$ . We have shown that  $h^* = b$ . It follows from the formula for the slope in linear regression that

$$ h ^ {*} = \rho \frac {\sigma_ {S}}{\sigma_ {F}} \tag {3.1}
$$ where  $\sigma_{S}$  is the standard deviation of  $\Delta S$ ,  $\sigma_{F}$  is the standard deviation of  $\Delta F$ , and  $\rho$  is the coefficient of correlation between the two.

Figure 3.3 Dependence of variance of hedger's position on hedge ratio.


Equation (3.1) shows that the optimal hedge ratio is the product of the coefficient of correlation between  $\Delta S$  and  $\Delta F$  and the ratio of the standard deviation of  $\Delta S$  to the standard deviation of  $\Delta F$ . Figure 3.3 shows how the variance of the value of the hedger's position depends on the hedge ratio chosen.

If  $\rho = 1$  and  $\sigma_F = \sigma_S$ , the hedge ratio,  $h^*$ , is 1.0. This result is to be expected, because in this case the futures price mirrors the spot price perfectly. If  $\rho = 1$  and  $\sigma_F = 2\sigma_S$ , the hedge ratio  $h^*$  is 0.5. This result is also as expected, because in this case the futures price always changes by twice as much as the spot price. The hedge effectiveness can be defined as the proportion of the variance that is eliminated by hedging. This is the  $R^2$  from the regression of  $\Delta S$  against  $\Delta F$  and equals  $\rho^2$ .

The parameters  $\rho$ ,  $\sigma_F$ , and  $\sigma_S$  in equation (3.1) are usually estimated from historical data on  $\Delta S$  and  $\Delta F$ . (The implicit assumption is that the future will in some sense be like the past.) A number of equal nonoverlapping time intervals are chosen, and the values of  $\Delta S$  and  $\Delta F$  for each of the intervals are observed. Ideally, the length of each time interval is the same as the length of the time interval for which the hedge is in effect. In practice, this sometimes severely limits the number of observations that are available, and a shorter time interval is used.

# Optimal Number of Contracts

To calculate the number of contracts that should be used in hedging, define:

$Q_{A}$ : Size of position being hedged (units)

$Q_{F}$ : Size of one futures contract (units)

$N^{*}$ : Optimal number of futures contracts for hedging.

The futures contracts should be on  $h^{*}Q_{A}$  units of the asset. The number of futures contracts required is therefore given by

$$

N ^ {*} = \frac {h ^ {*} Q _ {A}}{Q _ {F}} \tag {3.2}

$$

Example 3.3 shows how the results in this section can be used by an airline hedging the purchase of jet fuel.

# Example 3.3

An airline expects to purchase 2 million gallons of jet fuel in 1 month and decides to use heating oil futures for hedging. We suppose that Table 3.2 gives, for 15 successive months, data on the change,  $\Delta S$ , in the jet fuel price per gallon and the corresponding change,  $\Delta F$ , in the futures price for the contract on heating oil that would be used for hedging price changes during the month. In this case, the usual formulas for calculating standard deviations and correlations give  $\sigma_{F} = 0.0313$ ,  $\sigma_{S} = 0.0263$ , and  $\rho = 0.928$ .

From equation (3.1), the minimum variance hedge ratio,  $h^*$ , is therefore

$$
0. 9 2 8 \times \frac {0 . 0 2 6 3}{0 . 0 3 1 3} = 0. 7 8
$$

Each heating oil contract traded by the CME Group is on 42,000 gallons of heating oil. From equation (3.2), the optimal number of contracts is

$$

\frac {0 . 7 8 \times 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0}{4 2 , 0 0 0}

$$ which is 37 when rounded to the nearest whole number.

# Impact of Daily Settlement

The analysis we have presented so far is appropriate when forward contracts are used for hedging. The daily settlement of futures contract means that, when futures contracts are used, there are a series of one-day hedges, not a single hedge. Define:

$\hat{\sigma}_{S}$ : Standard deviation of percentage one-day changes in the spot price
$\hat{\sigma}_{F}$ : Standard deviation of percentage one day changes in the futures price
$\hat{\rho}$ : Correlation between percentage one-day changes in the spot and futures.

The standard deviation of one-day changes in spot and futures are  $\hat{\sigma}_{S}S$  and  $\hat{\sigma}_F F$ . Also,  $\hat{\rho}$  is the correlation between one-day changes. It follows from equation (3.1) that the optimal one-day hedge is

$$ h ^ {*} = \hat {\rho} \frac {\hat {\sigma} _ {S} S}{\hat {\sigma} _ {F} F}
$$ so that from equation (3.2)


$$

N ^ {*} = \hat {\rho} \frac {\hat {\sigma} _ {S} S Q _ {A}}{\hat {\sigma} _ {F} F Q _ {F}}

$$

The hedge ratio in equation (3.1) is based on regressing actual changes in spot prices against actual changes in futures prices. An alternative hedge ratio,  $\hat{h}$ , can be derived in the same way by regressing daily percentage changes in spot against daily percentage changes in futures:

$$

\hat {h} = \hat {\rho} \frac {\hat {\sigma} _ {S}}{\hat {\sigma} _ {F}}

$$

Then

$$

N ^ {*} = \frac {\hat {h} V _ {A}}{V _ {F}} \tag {3.3}

$$ where  $V_{A} = SQ_{A}$  is the value of the position being hedged and  $V_{F} = FQ_{F}$  is the futures price times the size of one contract.

Consider another situation where 2 million gallons of jet fuel is being hedged with heating oil futures. Suppose that the spot and futures price are 1.10 and 1.30, respectively. In this case,  $V_{A} = 2,000,000 \times 1.10 = 2,200,000$  while  $V_{F} = 42,000 \times 1.30 = 54,600$ . If  $\hat{\rho} = 0.8$ , the optimal number of contracts for a one-day hedge is

$$
\frac {0 . 8 \times 2 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0}{5 4 , 6 0 0} = 3 2. 2 3
$$ or 32 when rounded to the nearest whole number. The optimal hedge is liable to change from day to day as the relative values of spot and futures prices change. But the changes are usually small and often ignored.


The analysis can be refined by taking account of the interest that is earned or paid over the remaining life of the hedge. Suppose that the interest rate is  $5\%$  per annum and the hedge has a remaining life of one year. It is then appropriate to divide  $N^{*}$  by 1.05. This is referred to as tailing the hedge.

# 3.5 STOCK INDEX FUTURES

We now move on to consider stock index futures and how they are used to hedge or manage exposures to equity prices.

A stock index tracks changes in the value of a hypothetical portfolio of stocks. The weight of a stock in the portfolio at a particular time equals the proportion of the hypothetical portfolio invested in the stock at that time. The percentage increase in the stock index over a small interval of time is set equal to the percentage increase in the value of the hypothetical portfolio. Dividends are usually not included in the calculation so that the index tracks the capital gain/loss from investing in the portfolio.

If the hypothetical portfolio of stocks remains fixed, the weights assigned to individual stocks in the portfolio do not remain fixed. When the price of one particular stock in the portfolio rises more sharply than others, more weight is automatically given to that stock. Sometimes indices are constructed from a hypothetical portfolio consisting of one of each of a number of stocks. The weights assigned to the stocks are then proportional to their market prices, with adjustments being made when there are stock splits. Other indices are constructed so that weights are proportional to market capitalization (stock price  $\times$  number of shares outstanding). The underlying portfolio is then automatically adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock dividends, and new equity issues.

# Stock Indices

Table 3.3 shows futures prices for contracts on three different stock indices on May 21, 2021.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is based on a portfolio consisting of 30 blue-chip stocks in the United States. The weights given to the stocks are proportional to their prices. The CME Group trades two futures contracts on the index. One is on 10 times

Some futures contracts on indices outside the United States are also traded actively. An example is the contract on the CSI 300 index, a market-capitalization-weighted index of 300 Chinese stocks, which trades on the China Financial Futures Exchange (CFFEX, www.cffex.com.cn).

As mentioned in Chapter 2, futures contracts on stock indices are settled in cash, not by delivery of the underlying asset. All contracts are marked to market to either the opening price or the closing price of the index on the last trading day, and the positions are then deemed to be closed. For example, contracts on the S&P 500 are closed out at the opening price of the S&P 500 index on the third Friday of the delivery month.

# Hedging an Equity Portfolio

Stock index futures can be used to hedge a well-diversified equity portfolio. Define:

$V_{A}$ : Current value of the portfolio

$V_{F}$ : Current value of one futures contract (the futures price times the contract size).

If the portfolio mirrors the index, the optimal hedge ratio can be assumed to be 1.0 and equation (3.3) shows that the number of futures contracts that should be shorted is

$$

N ^ {*} = \frac {V _ {A}}{V _ {F}} \tag {3.4}

$$

Suppose, for example, that a portfolio worth  $5,050,000$  mirrors a well-diversified index. The index futures price is 1,010 and each futures contract is on  $\$250$ times the index. In this case  $V_{A} = 5,050,000$  and  $V_{F} = 1,010 \times 250 = 252,500$ , so that 20 contracts should be shorted to hedge the portfolio.

When the portfolio does not mirror the index, we can use the capital asset pricing model (see the appendix to this chapter). The parameter beta  $(\beta)$  from the capital asset pricing model is the slope of the best-fit line obtained when excess return on the portfolio over the risk-free rate is regressed against the excess return of the index over the risk-free rate. When  $\beta = 1.0$ , the return on the portfolio tends to mirror the return on the index; when  $\beta = 2.0$ , the excess return on the portfolio tends to be twice as great as the excess return on the index; when  $\beta = 0.5$ , it tends to be half as great; and so on.

A portfolio with a  $\beta$  of 2.0 is twice as sensitive to movements in the index as a portfolio with a beta 1.0. It is therefore necessary to use twice as many contracts to hedge the portfolio. Similarly, a portfolio with a beta of 0.5 is half as sensitive to market movements as a portfolio with a beta of 1.0 and we should use half as many contracts to hedge it. In general,


$$

N ^ {*} = \beta \frac {V _ {A}}{V _ {F}} \tag {3.5}

$$

This formula assumes that the maturity of the futures contract is close to the maturity of the hedge.

Comparing equation (3.5) with equation (3.3), we see that they imply  $\hat{h} = \beta$ . This is not surprising. The hedge ratio  $\hat{h}$  is the slope of the best-fit line when percentage one-day changes in the portfolio are regressed against percentage one-day changes in the futures price of the index. Beta  $(\beta)$  is the slope of the best-fit line when the return from the portfolio is regressed against the return for the index.

We illustrate that this formula gives good results by extending our earlier example. Suppose that a futures contract with 4 months to maturity is used to hedge the value of a portfolio over the next 3 months in the following situation:

Index level  $= 1,000$

Index futures price  $= 1,010$

Value of portfolio = 5,050,000

Risk-free interest rate  $= 4\%$  per annum

Dividend yield on index  $= 1\%$  per annum

Beta of portfolio  $= 1.5$

One futures contract is for delivery of 250 times the index. As before, V_{F} = 250 \times 1,010 = 252,500. From equation (3.5), the number of futures contracts that should be shorted to hedge the portfolio is

$$
1. 5 \times \frac {5 , 0 5 0 , 0 0 0}{2 5 2 , 5 0 0} = 3 0
$$

Suppose the index turns out to be 900 in 3 months and the futures price is 902. The gain from the short futures position is then

$$

3 0 \times (1 0 1 0 - 9 0 2) \times 2 5 0 = \$ 8 1 0, 0 0 0

$$

The loss on the index is  $10\%$ . The index pays a dividend of  $1\%$  per annum, or  $0.25\%$  per 3 months. When dividends are taken into account, an investor in the index would therefore earn  $-9.75\%$  over the 3-month period. Because the portfolio has a  $\beta$  of 1.5, the capital asset pricing model gives

Expected return on portfolio - Risk-free interest rate

$$

= 1. 5 \times (\text {R e t u r n o n i n d e x - R i s k - f r e e i n t e r s t r a t e})

$$

The risk-free interest rate is approximately  $1\%$  per 3 months. It follows that the expected return  $(\%)$  on the portfolio during the 3 months when the 3-month return on the index is  $-9.75\%$  is

$$
2. 0 + [ 1. 5 \times (- 9. 7 5 - 1. 0) ] = - 1 5. 1 2 5
$$

The expected value of the portfolio (inclusive of dividends) at the end of the 3 months is

Table 3.4 Performance of stock index hedge.

<table><tr><td>Value of index in three months:</td><td>900</td><td>950</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,050</td><td>1,100</td></tr><tr><td>Futures price of index today:</td><td>1,010</td><td>1,010</td><td>1,010</td><td>1,010</td><td>1,010</td></tr><tr><td>Futures price of index in three months:</td><td>902</td><td>952</td><td>1,003</td><td>1,053</td><td>1,103</td></tr><tr><td>Gain on futures position ($):</td><td>810,000</td><td>435,000</td><td>52,500</td><td>-322,500</td><td>-697,500</td></tr><tr><td>Return on market:</td><td>-9.750\%</td><td>-4.750\%</td><td>0.250\%</td><td>5.250\%</td><td>10.250\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected return on portfolio:</td><td>-15.125\%</td><td>-7.625\%</td><td>-0.125\%</td><td>7.375\%</td><td>14.875\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected portfolio value in three

therefore

$$

\$ 5,050,000 \times (1 - 0.15125) = \$ 4,286,187

$$

It follows that the expected value of the hedger's position, including the gain on the hedge, is

$$

\$ 4,286,187 + \$ 810,000 = \$ 5,096,187

$$

Table 3.4 summarizes these calculations together with similar calculations for other values of the index at maturity. It can be seen that the total expected value of the hedger's position in 3 months is almost independent of the value of the index. This is what one would expect if the hedge is a good one.

The only thing we have not covered so far is the relationship between futures prices and spot prices. We will see in Chapter 5 that the 1,010 assumed for the futures price today is roughly what we would expect given the interest rate and dividend we are assuming. The same is true of the futures prices in 3 months shown in Table 3.4.

# Reasons for Hedging an Equity Portfolio

Table 3.4 shows that the hedging procedure results in a value for the hedger's position at the end of the 3-month period being about  $1\%$  higher than at the beginning of the 3-month period. There is no surprise here. The risk-free rate is  $4\%$  per annum, or  $1\%$  per 3 months. The hedge results in the investor's position growing at the risk-free rate.

It is natural to ask why the hedger should go to the trouble of using futures contracts. To earn the risk-free interest rate, the hedger can simply sell the portfolio and invest the proceeds in a risk-free security.

One answer to this question is that hedging can be justified if the hedger feels that the stocks in the portfolio have been chosen well. In these circumstances, the hedger might be very uncertain about the performance of the market as a whole, but confident that the stocks in the portfolio will outperform the market (after appropriate adjustments have been made for the beta of the portfolio). A hedge using index futures removes the risk arising from market moves and leaves the hedger exposed only to the performance of the portfolio relative to the market. This will be discussed further shortly. Another reason for hedging may be that the hedger is planning to hold a portfolio for a long period of time and requires short-term protection in an uncertain market situation. The alternative strategy of selling the portfolio and buying it back later might involve unacceptably high transaction costs.


# Changing the Beta of a Portfolio

In the example in Table 3.4, the beta of the hedger's portfolio is reduced to zero so that the hedger's expected return is almost independent of the performance of the index. Sometimes futures contracts are used to change the beta of a portfolio to some value other than zero. Continuing with our earlier example:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \text {I n d e x} = 1, 0 0 0 \\ \text {I n d e x f u t u r e s p r i c e} = 1, 0 1 0 \\ \text {V a l u e o f p o r t f i l o} = \$ 5, 0 5 0, 0 0 0 \\ \text {B e t a o f p o r t f i l o} = 1. 5 \\ \end{array}

$$

As before,  $V_{F} = 250 \times 1,010 = 252,500$  and a complete hedge requires

$$
3. 5 \times \frac {5 , 0 5 0 , 0 0 0}{2 5 2 , 5 0 0} = 3 0
$$ contracts to be shorted. To reduce the beta of the portfolio from 1.5 to 0.75, the number of contracts shorted should be 15 rather than 30; to increase the beta of the portfolio to 2.0, a long position in 10 contracts should be taken; and so on. In general, to change the beta of the portfolio from  $\beta$  to  $\beta^{*}$ , where  $\beta > \beta^{*}$ , a short position in

$$
(\beta - \beta^ {*}) \frac {V _ {A}}{V _ {F}}
$$ contracts is required. When  $\beta <  \beta^{*}$  , a long position in


$$

(\beta^ {*} - \beta) \frac {V _ {A}}{V _ {F}}

$$ contracts is required.


# Locking in the Benefits of Stock Picking

Suppose you consider yourself to be good at picking stocks that will outperform the market. You own a single stock or a small portfolio of stocks. You do not know how well the market will perform over the next few months, but you are confident that your portfolio will do better than the market. What should you do?

You should short  $\beta V_A / V_F$  index futures contracts, where  $\beta$  is the beta of your portfolio,  $V_A$  is the total value of the portfolio, and  $V_F$  is the current value of one index futures contract. If your portfolio performs better than a well-diversified portfolio with the same beta, you will then make money.

Consider an investor who in April holds 20,000 shares of a company, each worth $100. The investor feels that the market will be very volatile over the next three months but that the company has a good chance of outperforming the market. The investor decides to use the August futures contract on the Mini S&P 500 to hedge the market's return during the three-month period. The β of the company's stock is estimated at 1.1. Suppose that the current futures price for the August contract on the Mini S&P 500 is 2,100. Each contract is for delivery of $50 times the index. In this case,  $V_{A} = 20,000 \times 100 = 2,000,000$  and  $V_{F} = 2,100 \times 50 = 105,000$ . The number of contracts that should be shorted is therefore

$$
1. 1 \times \frac {2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 0 5 , 0 0 0} = 2 0. 9 5
$$

Rounding to the nearest integer, the investor shorts 21 contracts, closing out the position in July. Suppose the company's stock price falls to  $90 and the futures price of the Mini S&P 500 falls to 1,850. The investor loses 20,000 \times ($ 100 - $90) = $200,000 on the stock, while gaining 21 \times 50 \times (2,100 - 1,850) = 262,500 on the futures contracts.

The overall gain to the investor in this case is 62,500 because the company's stock price did not go down by as much as a well-diversified portfolio with a \beta of 1.1. If the market had gone up and the company's stock price went up by more than a portfolio with a \beta of 1.1 (as expected by the investor), then a profit would be made in this case as well.

# 3.6 STACK AND ROLL

Sometimes the expiration date of the hedge is later than the delivery dates of all the futures contracts that can be used. The hedger must then roll the hedge forward by closing out one futures contract and taking the same position in a futures contract with a later delivery date. Hedges can be rolled forward many times. The procedure is known as stack and roll. Consider a company that wishes to use a short hedge to reduce the risk associated with the price to be received for an asset at time  $T$ . If there are futures contracts 1, 2, 3, . . ., n (not all necessarily in existence at the present time) with progressively later delivery dates, the company can use the following strategy:

Time  $t_1$ : Short futures contract 1

Time  $t_2$ : Close out futures contract 1

Short futures contract 2

Time  $t_3$ : Close out futures contract 2

Short futures contract 3

：

Time  $t_n$ : Close out futures contract  $n - 1$

Short futures contract  $n$

Time  $T$ : Close out futures contract  $n$ .

Suppose that in April 2021 a company realizes that it will have 100,000 barrels of oil to sell in June 2022 and decides to hedge its risk with a hedge ratio of 1.0. (In this example, we do not make the adjustment for daily settlement described in Section 3.4.) The current spot price is 49. Although futures contracts are traded with maturities stretching several

Table 3.5 Data for the example on rolling oil hedge forward.

<table><tr><td>Date</td><td>Apr. 2021</td><td>Sept. 2021</td><td>Feb. 2022</td><td>June 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Oct. 2021 futures price</td><td>48.20</td><td>47.40</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mar. 2022 futures price</td><td></td><td>47.00</td><td>46.50</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>July 2022 futures price</td><td></td><td></td><td>46.30</td><td>45.90</td></tr><tr><td>Spot price</td><td>49.00</td><td></td><td></td><td>46.00</td></tr></table> years into the future, we suppose that only the first six delivery months have sufficient liquidity to meet the company's needs. The company therefore shorts 100 October 2021 contracts. In September 2021, it rolls the hedge forward into the March 2022 contract. In February 2022, it rolls the hedge forward again into the July 2022 contract.


One possible outcome is shown in Table 3.5. The October 2021 contract is shorted at $48.20 per barrel and closed out at $47.40 per barrel for a profit of $0.80 per barrel; the March 2022 contract is shorted at $47.00 per barrel and closed out at $46.50 per barrel for a profit of $0.50 per barrel. The July 2022 contract is shorted at $46.30 per barrel and closed out at $45.90 per barrel for a profit of $0.40 per barrel. The final spot price is $46.

The dollar gain per barrel of oil from the short futures contracts is

$$

(4 8. 2 0 - 4 7. 4 0) + (4 7. 0 0 - 4 6. 5 0) + (4 6. 3 0 - 4 5. 9 0) = 1. 7 0

$$

The oil price declined from 49 to 46. Receiving only 1.70 per barrel compensation for a price decline of 3.00 may appear unsatisfactory. However, we cannot expect total compensation for a price decline when futures prices are below spot prices. The best we can hope for is to lock in the futures price that would apply to a June 2022 contract if it were actively traded.

In practice, a company usually has an exposure every month to the underlying asset and uses a 1-month futures contract for hedging because it is the most liquid. Initially it enters into ("stacks") sufficient contracts to cover its exposure to the end of its hedging horizon. One month later, it closes out all the contracts and "rolls" them into new 1-month contracts to cover its new exposure, and so on.

As described in Business Snapshot 3.2, a German company, Metallgesellschaft, followed this strategy in the early 1990s to hedge contracts it had entered into to supply commodities at a fixed price. It ran into difficulties because the prices of the commodities declined so that there were immediate cash outflows on the futures and the expectation of eventual gains on the contracts. This mismatch between the timing of the cash flows on hedge and the timing of the cash flows from the position being hedged led to liquidity problems that could not be handled. The moral of the story is that potential liquidity problems should always be considered when a hedging strategy is being planned.

# SUMMARY

This chapter has discussed various ways in which a company can take a position in futures contracts to offset an exposure to the price of an asset. If the exposure is such

# Business Snapshot 3.2 Metallgesellschaft: Hedging Gone Awry

Sometimes rolling hedges forward can lead to cash flow pressures. The problem was illustrated dramatically by the activities of a German company, Metallgesellschaft (MG), in the early 1990s.

MG sold a huge volume of 5- to 10-year heating oil and gasoline fixed-price supply contracts to its customers at 6 to 8 cents above market prices. It hedged its exposure with long positions in short-dated futures contracts that were rolled forward. As it turned out, the price of oil fell and there were margin calls on the futures positions. Considerable short-term cash flow pressures were placed on MG. The members of MG who devised the hedging strategy argued that these short-term cash outflows were offset by positive cash flows that would ultimately be realized on the long-term fixed-price contracts. However, the company's senior management and its bankers became concerned about the huge cash drain. As a result, the company closed out all the hedge positions and agreed with its customers that the fixed-price contracts would be abandoned. The outcome was a loss to MG of 1.33 billion.

that the company gains when the price of the asset increases and loses when the price of the asset decreases, a short hedge is appropriate. If the exposure is the other way round (i.e., the company gains when the price of the asset decreases and loses when the price of the asset increases), a long hedge is appropriate.

Hedging is a way of reducing risk. As such, it should be welcomed by most executives. In reality, there are a number of theoretical and practical reasons why companies do not hedge. On a theoretical level, we can argue that shareholders, by holding well-diversified portfolios, can eliminate many of the risks faced by a company. They do not require the company to hedge these risks. On a practical level, a company may find that it is increasing rather than decreasing risk by hedging if none of its competitors does so. Also, a treasurer may fear criticism from other executives if the company makes a gain from movements in the price of the underlying asset and a loss on the hedge.

An important concept in hedging is basis risk. The basis is the difference between the spot price of an asset and its futures price. Basis risk arises from uncertainty as to what the basis will be at maturity of the hedge.

The hedge ratio is the ratio of the size of the position taken in futures contracts to the size of the exposure. It is not always optimal to use a hedge ratio of 1.0. If the hedger wishes to minimize the variance of a position, a hedge ratio different from 1.0 may be appropriate. The optimal hedge ratio is the slope of the best-fit line obtained when changes in the spot price are regressed against changes in the futures price.

Stock index futures can be used to hedge the systematic risk in an equity portfolio. The number of futures contracts required is the beta of the portfolio multiplied by the ratio of the value of the portfolio to the value of one futures contract. Stock index futures can also be used to change the beta of a portfolio without changing the stocks that make up the portfolio.

When there is no liquid futures contract that matures later than the expiration of the hedge, a strategy known as stack and roll may be appropriate. This involves entering into a sequence of futures contracts. When the first futures contract is near expiration, it is closed out and the hedger enters into a second contract with a later delivery month. When the second contract is close to expiration, it is closed out and the hedger enters into a third contract with a later delivery month; and so on. The result of all this is the creation of a long-dated futures contract by trading a series of short-dated contracts.

# APPENDIX CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL

The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a model that can be used to relate the expected return from an asset to the risk of the return. The risk in the return from an asset is divided into two parts. Systematic risk is risk related to the return from the market as a whole and cannot be diversified away. Nonsystematic risk is risk that is unique to the asset and can be diversified away by choosing a large portfolio of different assets. CAPM argues that the return should depend only on systematic risk. The CAPM formula is

$$

\text {E x p e c t e d} = R _ {F} + \beta \left(R _ {M} - R _ {F}\right) \tag {3A.1}

$$ where  $R_{M}$  is the return on the portfolio of all available investments,  $R_{F}$  is the return on a risk-free investment, and  $\beta$  (the Greek letter beta) is a parameter measuring systematic risk.

The return from the portfolio of all available investments,  $R_{M}$ , is referred to as the return on the market and is usually approximated as the return on a well-diversified stock index such as the S&P 500. The beta  $(\beta)$  of an asset is a measure of the sensitivity of its returns to returns from the market. It can be estimated from historical data as the slope obtained when the excess return on the asset over the risk-free rate is regressed against the excess return on the market over the risk-free rate. When  $\beta = 0$ , an asset's returns are not sensitive to returns from the market. In this case, it has no systematic risk and equation (3A.1) shows that its expected return is the risk-free rate; when  $\beta = 0.5$ , the excess return on the asset over the risk-free rate is on average half of the excess return of the market over the risk-free rate; when  $\beta = 1$ , the expected return on the asset equals to the return on the market; and so on.

Suppose that the risk-free rate  $R_{F}$  is  $5\%$  and the return on the market is  $13\%$ . Equation (3A.1) shows that, when the beta of an asset is zero, its expected return is  $5\%$ . When  $\beta = 0.75$ , its expected return is  $0.05 + 0.75 \times (0.13 - 0.05) = 0.11$ , or  $11\%$ .

The derivation of CAPM requires a number of assumptions. In particular:

1. Investors care only about the expected return and standard deviation of the return from an asset.
2. The returns from two assets are correlated with each other only because of their correlation with the return from the market. This is equivalent to assuming that there is only one factor driving returns.
3. Investors focus on returns over a single period and that period is the same for all investors.
4. Investors can borrow and lend at the same risk-free rate.
5. Tax does not influence investment decisions.
6. All investors make the same estimates of expected returns, standard deviations of returns, and correlations between returns.

These assumptions are at best only approximately true. Nevertheless CAPM has proved to be a useful tool for portfolio managers and is often used as a benchmark for assessing their performance.

When the asset is an individual stock, the expected return given by equation (3A.1) is not a particularly good predictor of the actual return. But, when the asset is a well-diversified portfolio of stocks, it is a much better predictor. As a result, the equation

$$
\text {R e t u r n} = R _ {F} + \beta \left(R _ {M} - R _ {F}\right)
$$ can be used as a basis for hedging a diversified portfolio, as described in Section 3.5. The  $\beta$  in the equation is the beta of the portfolio. It can be calculated as the weighted average of the betas of the stocks in the portfolio.


# Interest Rates

Interest rates are a factor in the valuation of virtually all derivatives and will feature prominently in much of the material that will be presented in the rest of this book. This chapter introduces a number of different types of interest rate. It deals with some fundamental issues concerned with the way interest rates are measured and analyzed. It explains the compounding frequency used to define an interest rate and the meaning of continuously compounded interest rates, which are used extensively in the analysis of derivatives. It covers zero rates, par yields, and yield curves, discusses bond pricing, and outlines a "bootstrap" procedure commonly used to calculate zero-coupon interest rates. It also covers forward rates and forward rate agreements and reviews different theories of the term structure of interest rates. Finally, it explains the use of duration and convexity measures to determine the sensitivity of bond prices to interest rate changes.

Chapter 6 will cover interest rate futures and show how the duration measure can be used when interest rate exposures are hedged. For ease of exposition, day count conventions will be ignored throughout this chapter. The nature of these conventions and their impact on calculations will be discussed in Chapters 6 and 7.

# 4.1 TYPES OF RATES

An interest rate in a particular situation defines the amount of money a borrower promises to pay the lender. For any given currency, many different types of interest rates are regularly quoted. These include mortgage rates, deposit rates, prime borrowing rates, and so on. One important factor influencing interest rates is credit risk. This is the risk that there will be a default by the borrower of funds, so that the interest and principal are not paid to the lender as promised. The higher the credit risk, the higher the interest rate that is promised by the borrower. The extra amount added to a risk-free interest rate to allow for credit risk is known as a credit spread.

Interest rates are often expressed in basis points. One basis point is  $0.01\%$  per annum.

# Treasury Rates

Treasury rates are the rates an investor earns on Treasury bills and Treasury bonds. These are the instruments used by a government to borrow in its own currency. Japanese Treasury rates are the rates at which the Japanese government borrows in yen; U.S. Treasury rates are the rates at which the U.S. government borrows in U.S. dollars; and so on. It is usually assumed that there is no chance that the government of a developed country will default on an obligation denominated in its own currency. A developed country's Treasury rates are therefore regarded as risk-free in the sense that an investor who buys a Treasury bill or Treasury bond is certain that interest and principal payments will be made as promised.


# Overnight Rates

Banks are required to maintain a certain amount of cash, known as a reserve, with the central bank. The reserve requirement for a bank at any time depends on its outstanding assets and liabilities. At the end of a day, some financial institutions typically have surplus funds in their accounts with the central bank while others have requirements for funds. This leads to borrowing and lending overnight. A broker usually matches borrowers and lenders. In the United States, the central bank is the Federal Reserve (often referred to as the Fed) and the overnight rate is called the federal funds rate. The weighted average of the rates in brokered transactions (with weights being determined by the size of the transaction) is termed the effective federal funds rate. This overnight rate is monitored by the Federal Reserve, which may intervene with its own transactions in an attempt to raise or lower it. Other countries have similar systems to the United States. For example, in the United Kingdom, the average of brokered overnight rates is the sterling overnight index average (SONIA); in the eurozone, it is the euro short-term rate (ESTER);[1] in Switzerland, it is the Swiss average rate overnight (SARON); in Japan, it is the Tokyo overnight average rate (TONAR).

# Repo Rates

Unlike the overnight federal funds rate, repo rates are secured borrowing rates. In a repo (or repurchase agreement), a financial institution that owns securities agrees to sell the securities for a certain price and buy them back at a later time for a slightly higher price. The financial institution is obtaining a loan and the interest it pays is the difference between the price at which the securities are sold and the price at which they are repurchased. The interest rate is referred to as the repo rate.

If structured carefully, a repo involves very little credit risk. If the borrower does not honor the agreement, the lending company simply keeps the securities. If the lending company does not keep to its side of the agreement, the original owner of the securities keeps the cash provided by the lending company. The most common type of repo is an overnight repo, where funds are lent overnight. However, longer-term arrangements, known as term repos, are sometimes used. Because it is a secured rate, a repo rate is theoretically very slightly below the corresponding fed funds rate.

The secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) is an important volume-weighted median average of the rates on overnight repo transactions in the United States.

# 4.2 REFERENCE RATES

Reference interest rates are important in financial markets. The parties to transactions frequently enter into contracts where the future interest rate paid or received is uncertain, but will be set equal the value of an agreed reference interest rate.

# LIBOR

LIBOR is short for London Interbank Offered Rate. It has historically been a very important reference rate. LIBOR rates have been compiled by asking a panel of global banks to provide quotes estimating the unsecured rates of interest at which they could borrow from other banks just prior to 11 a.m. (U.K. time). Several different currencies and several different borrowing periods (ranging from one day to one year) were considered. The banks submitting quotes typically had good credit ratings. LIBOR rates were therefore considered to be estimates of unsecured borrowing rates for creditworthy banks.

LIBOR rates have served as reference rates for hundreds of trillions of dollars of transactions throughout the world. For example, the borrowing rate on a five-year loan in a particular situation might be specified as three-month LIBOR plus 30 basis points (i.e., three-month LIBOR plus  $0.3\%$ ). The value of three-month LIBOR would then be noted at the beginning of each three-month period and interest based on this LIBOR rate would be paid by the borrower at the end of the period.

A problem with LIBOR is that there is not enough borrowing between banks for a bank's estimates to be determined by market transactions. As a result, LIBOR submissions by banks involved a certain amount of judgment and could be subject to manipulation. Bank regulators are uncomfortable with this and have developed plans to phase out the use of LIBOR. Originally, the deadline for LIBOR to be discontinued was the end of 2021, but quotes may continue for a period after that to make it easier to deal with the existing contracts that depend on LIBOR.

# The New Reference Rates

The plan is to base reference rates on the overnight rates we have mentioned. For example, the new reference rate in the United States will be SOFR; in the U.K., it will be SONIA; in the eurozone, it will be ESTER; in Switzerland, it will be SARON; in Japan, it will be TONAR. (Note that the overnight rate in the U.S. will be a secured overnight rate because it is a repo rate; the overnight rate in other countries will be unsecured because, as explained earlier, they are determined from the overnight transactions between banks when they manage reserves.)

Longer rates such as three-month rates, six-month rates, or one-year rates can be determined from overnight rates by compounding them daily. In the case of SOFR, there are assumed to be 360 days per year. (See Chapter 6 for a discussion of day count conventions) Suppose that the (annualized) SOFR overnight rate on the  $i$ th business day of a period is  $r_i$  ( $1 \leq i \leq n$ ) and the rate applies to  $d_i$  days. The (annualized) interest rate for the period is

$$

\left[ \left(1 + r _ {1} \hat {d} _ {1}\right) \left(1 + r _ {2} \hat {d} _ {2}\right) \dots \left(1 + r _ {n} \hat {d} _ {n}\right) - 1 \right] \times \frac {3 6 0}{D}

$$ where  $\hat{d}_i = d_i / 360$  and  $D = \sum_{i}d_{i}$  is the number of days in the period. On most days  $d_{i} = 1$ , but weekends and holidays lead to the overnight rates being applied to more than one day. (For example, on a Friday  $d_{i}$  will normally be equal to 3.)

The new reference rates are regarded as risk-free because they are derived from one-day loans to creditworthy financial institutions. LIBOR, by contrast, incorporates a credit spread. There is another important difference between the old and new reference rates. LIBOR rates are forward looking. They are determined at the beginning of the period to which they will apply. The new reference rates are backward looking. The rate applicable to a particular period is not known until the end of the period when all the relevant overnight rates have been observed.

As we will discuss in Chapter 7, swaps are a way in which short-term interest rates can be used to determine the equivalent interest rates that apply to relatively long periods.

# Reference Rates and Credit Risk

One problem faced by banks is that credit spreads in the economy increase in stressed market conditions. For example, the spread between three-month LIBOR and a three-month rate based on overnight rates is usually about 10 basis points  $(0.1\%)$ , but it can be much higher in stressed market conditions. For example, it spiked to an all-time high of 364 basis points  $(3.64\%)$  in the United States in October 2008 during the financial crisis. If a bank offers a loan at a reference rate plus  $x\%$ , where  $x$  is a constant, it would like the rate to reflect ups and downs in average credit spreads. LIBOR, when used as a reference rate, did this, but the new reference rates (because they are essentially risk-free) do not. This has led banks to ask for a way of creating risky reference rates by adding a credit spread to the new reference rates. There have been a number of proposals and the new risk-free reference rates may be augmented by credit spread measures in the future.

# 4.3 THE RISK-FREE RATE

As we shall see, the usual approach to valuing derivatives involves setting up a riskless portfolio and arguing that the return on the portfolio should be the risk-free rate. The risk-free rate therefore plays a central role in derivatives pricing. It might be thought that derivatives traders would use the rates on Treasury bills and Treasury bonds as risk-free rates. In fact they do not do this. This is because there are tax and regulatory factors that lead to Treasury rates being artificially low. For example:

1. Banks are not required to keep capital for investments in a Treasury instruments, but they are required to keep capital for other very low risk instruments.
2. In the United States, Treasury instruments are given favorable tax treatment compared with other very low risk instruments because the interest earned by investors is not taxed at the state level.

The risk-free reference rates created from from overnight rates (see Section 4.2) are the ones used in valuing derivatives.

# 4.4 MEASURING INTEREST RATES

A statement by a bank that the interest rate on one-year deposits is  $10\%$  per annum sounds straightforward and unambiguous. In fact, its precise meaning depends on the way the interest rate is measured.

Table 4.1 Effect of the compounding frequency on the value of  $\$ {100}$  at the end of 1 year when the interest rate is 10\% per annum.

<table><tr><td>Compounding frequency</td><td>Value of $100 at end of year ($)</td></tr><tr><td>Annually (m = 1)</td><td>110.00</td></tr><tr><td>Semiannually (m = 2)</td><td>110.25</td></tr><tr><td>Quarterly (m = 4)</td><td>110.38</td></tr><tr><td>Monthly (m = 12)</td><td>110.47</td></tr><tr><td>Weekly (m = 52)</td><td>110.51</td></tr><tr><td>Daily (m = 365)</td><td>110.52</td></tr></table>

If the interest rate is measured with annual compounding, the bank's statement that the interest rate is  $10\%$  means that  $\$ 100$  grows to

$$
\$ 100 \times 1.1 = \$ 110
$$ at the end of 1 year. When the interest rate is measured with semiannual compounding, it means that  $5\%$  is earned every 6 months, with the interest being reinvested. In this case,  $\$ 100$  grows to


$$

\$ 100 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 = \$ 110.25

$$ at the end of 1 year. When the interest rate is measured with quarterly compounding, the bank's statement means that  $2.5\%$  is earned every 3 months, with the interest being reinvested. The  $\$ 100$ then grows to

$$
\$ 100 \times 1.025 ^ {4} = \$ 110.38
$$ at the end of 1 year. Table 4.1 shows the effect of increasing the compounding frequency further.


The compounding frequency defines the units in which an interest rate is measured. A rate expressed with one compounding frequency can be converted into an equivalent rate with a different compounding frequency. For example, from Table 4.1 we see that  $10.25\%$  with annual compounding is equivalent to  $10\%$  with semiannual compounding. We can think of the difference between one compounding frequency and another to be analogous to the difference between kilometers and miles. They are two different units of measurement.

To generalize our results, suppose that an amount  $A$  is invested for  $n$  years at an interest rate of  $R$  per annum. If the rate is compounded once per annum, the terminal value of the investment is

$$

A (1 + R) ^ {n}

$$

If the rate is compounded  $m$  times per annum, the terminal value of the investment is

$$

A \left(1 + \frac {R}{m}\right) ^ {m n} \tag {4.1}

$$

When  $m = 1$ , the rate is sometimes referred to as the equivalent annual interest rate.

Suppose  $R_{1}$  is an interest rate when compounding is  $m_{1}$  times per year and  $R_{2}$  is the equivalent rate when compounding is  $m_{2}$  times per year. From equation (4.1), the values of an investment of  $A$  after  $n$  years is the same if:

$$

A \left(1 + \frac {R _ {1}}{m _ {1}}\right) ^ {m _ {1} n} = A \left(1 + \frac {R _ {2}}{m _ {2}}\right) ^ {m _ {2} n}

$$

This means that

$$

R _ {2} = m _ {2} \left[ \left(1 + \frac {R _ {1}}{m _ {1}}\right) ^ {m _ {1} / m _ {2}} - 1 \right]

$$

As an example of the application of this formula, suppose that an interest rate is  $6\%$  with semiannual compounding. The equivalent rate with quarterly compounding can be calculated by setting  $m_{1} = 2$ ,  $R_{1} = 0.06$ , and  $m_{2} = 4$ . It is:

$$

R _ {2} = 4 \left[ \left(1 + \frac {0 . 0 6}{2}\right) ^ {2 / 4} - 1 \right] = 0. 0 5 9 6

$$ or  $5.96\%$ .

# Continuous Compounding

The limit as the compounding frequency,  $m$ , tends to infinity is known as continuous compounding. With continuous compounding, it can be shown that an amount  $A$  invested for  $n$  years at rate  $R$  grows to

$$
A e ^ {R n} \tag {4.2}
$$ where  $e$  is approximately 2.71828. The exponential function,  $e^x$ , is built into most calculators, so the computation of the expression in equation (4.2) presents no problems. In the example in Table 4.1,  $A = 100$ ,  $n = 1$ , and  $R = 0.1$ , so that the value to which  $A$  grows with continuous compounding is


$$

1 0 0 e ^ {0. 1} = \$ 1 1 0. 5 2

$$

This is (to two decimal places) the same as the value with daily compounding. For most practical purposes, continuous compounding can be thought of as being equivalent to daily compounding. Compounding a sum of money at a continuously compounded rate  $R$  for  $n$  years involves multiplying it by  $e^{Rn}$ . Discounting it at a continuously compounded rate  $R$  for  $n$  years involves multiplying by  $e^{-Rn}$ .

In this book, interest rates will be measured with continuous compounding except where stated otherwise. Readers used to working with interest rates that are measured with annual, semiannual, or some other compounding frequency may find this a little strange at first. However, continuously compounded interest rates are used to such a great extent in pricing derivatives that it makes sense to get used to working with them now.

Suppose that  $R_{c}$  is a rate of interest with continuous compounding and  $R_{m}$  is the equivalent rate with compounding  $m$  times per annum. From the results in equations (4.1) and (4.2), we have

$$

A e ^ {R _ {c} n} = A \left(1 + \frac {R _ {m}}{m}\right) ^ {m n}

$$ or


$$ e ^ {R _ {c}} = \left(1 + \frac {R _ {m}}{m}\right) ^ {m}
$$

This means that

$$
R _ {c} = m \ln \left(1 + \frac {R _ {m}}{m}\right) \tag {4.3}
$$ and


$$

R _ {m} = m \left(e ^ {R _ {c} / m} - 1\right) \tag {4.4}

$$

These equations can be used to convert a rate with a compounding frequency of  $m$  times per annum to a continuously compounded rate and vice versa. The natural logarithm function  $\ln x$ , which is built into most calculators, is the inverse of the exponential function, so that, if  $y = \ln x$ , then  $x = e^{y}$ .

# Example 4.1

Consider an interest rate that is quoted as  $10\%$  per annum with semiannual compounding. From equation (4.3) with  $m = 2$  and  $R_{m} = 0.1$ , the equivalent rate with continuous compounding is

$$

2 \ln \left(1 + \frac {0 . 1}{2}\right) = 0. 0 9 7 5 8

$$ or  $9.758\%$  per annum.

# Example 4.2

Suppose that a lender quotes the interest rate on loans as  $8\%$  per annum with continuous compounding, and that interest is actually paid quarterly. From equation (4.4) with  $m = 4$  and  $R_{c} = 0.08$ , the equivalent rate with quarterly compounding is

$$
4 \times (e ^ {0. 0 8 / 4} - 1) = 0. 0 8 0 8
$$ or  $8.08\%$  per annum. This means that on a  $\$ 1,000$ loan, interest payments of  $\$ 20.20$ would be required each quarter.


# 4.5 ZERO RATES

The  $n$ -year zero-coupon interest rate is the rate of interest earned on an investment that starts today and lasts for  $n$  years. All the interest and principal is realized at the end of  $n$  years. There are no intermediate payments. The  $n$ -year zero-coupon interest rate is sometimes also referred to as the  $n$ -year spot rate, the  $n$ -year zero rate, or just the  $n$ -year zero. Suppose a 5-year zero rate with continuous compounding is quoted as  $5\%$  per annum. This means that 100, if invested for 5 years, grows to

$$

1 0 0 \times e ^ {0. 0 5 \times 5} = 1 2 8. 4 0

$$

Most of the interest rates we observe directly in the market are not pure zero rates. Consider a 5-year risk-free bond that provides a  $6\%$  coupon (i.e., it pays interest at a rate of  $6\%$  per year). The price of this bond does not by itself determine the 5-year risk-free zero rate because some of the return on the bond is realized in the form of coupons prior to the end of year 5. Later in this chapter we will discuss how we can determine zero rates from the market prices of coupon-bearing instruments.


# 4.6 BOND PRICING

Most bonds pay coupons to the holder periodically. The bond's principal (which is also known as its par value or face value) is paid at the end of its life. The theoretical price of a bond can be calculated as the present value of all the cash flows that will be received by the owner of the bond. Sometimes bond traders use the same discount rate for all the cash flows underlying a bond, but a more accurate approach is to use a different zero rate for each cash flow.

To illustrate this, consider the situation where zero rates, measured with continuous compounding, are as in Table 4.2. (We explain later how these can be calculated.) Suppose that a 2-year bond with a principal of 100 provides coupons at the rate of 6\% per annum semiannually. To calculate the present value of the first coupon of 3, we discount it at 5.0\% for 6 months; to calculate the present value of the second coupon of 3, we discount it at 5.8\% for 1 year; and so on. Therefore, the theoretical price of the bond is

$$

3 e ^ {- 0. 0 5 \times 0. 5} + 3 e ^ {- 0. 0 5 8 \times 1. 0} + 3 e ^ {- 0. 0 6 4 \times 1. 5} + 1 0 3 e ^ {- 0. 0 6 8 \times 2. 0} = 9 8. 3 9

$$ or 98.39. (DerivaGem can be used to calculate bond prices.)


# Bond Yield

A bond's yield is the single discount rate that, when applied to all cash flows, gives a bond price equal to its market price. Suppose that the theoretical price of the bond we have been considering,  \98.39 , is also its market value (i.e., the market's price of the bond is in exact agreement with the data in Table 4.2). If  y  is the yield on the bond, expressed with continuous compounding, it must be true that

$$

3 e ^ {- y \times 0. 5} + 3 e ^ {- y \times 1. 0} + 3 e ^ {- y \times 1. 5} + 1 0 3 e ^ {- y \times 2. 0} = 9 8. 3 9

$$

This equation can be solved using an iterative ("trial and error") procedure to give  $y = 6.76\%$ .

Table 4.2 Zero rates.

<table><tr><td>Maturity (years)</td><td>Zero rate(\% continuously compounded)</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>5.8</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>6.4</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>6.8</td></tr></table>

# Par Yield

The par yield for a certain bond maturity is the coupon rate that causes the bond price to equal its par value. (The par value is the same as the principal value.) Usually the bond is assumed to provide semiannual coupons. Suppose that the coupon on a 2-year bond in our example is  $c$  per annum (or  $\frac{1}{2}c$  per 6 months). Using the zero rates in Table 4.2, the value of the bond is equal to its par value of 100 when

$$

\frac {c}{2} e ^ {- 0. 0 5 \times 0. 5} + \frac {c}{2} e ^ {- 0. 0 5 8 \times 1. 0} + \frac {c}{2} e ^ {- 0. 0 6 4 \times 1. 5} + \left(1 0 0 + \frac {c}{2}\right) e ^ {- 0. 0 6 8 \times 2. 0} = 1 0 0

$$

This equation can be solved in a straightforward way to give  $c = 6.87$ . The 2-year par yield is therefore  $6.87\%$  per annum.

More generally, if  $d$  is the present value of $1 received at the maturity of the bond,  $A$  is the value of an annuity that pays one dollar on each coupon payment date, and  $m$  is the number of coupon payments per year, then the par yield  $c$  must satisfy

$$

1 0 0 = A \frac {c}{m} + 1 0 0 d

$$ so that


$$ c = \frac {(1 0 0 - 1 0 0 d) m}{A}
$$

In our example,  $m = 2$ ,  $d = e^{-0.068 \times 2} = 0.87284$ , and

$$
A = e ^ {- 0. 0 5 \times 0. 5} + e ^ {- 0. 0 5 8 \times 1. 0} + e ^ {- 0. 0 6 4 \times 1. 5} + e ^ {- 0. 0 6 8 \times 2. 0} = 3. 7 0 0 2 7
$$

The formula confirms that the par yield is  $6.87\%$  per annum. A bond with this coupon and semiannual payments is worth par.

# 4.7 DETERMINING ZERO RATES

In this section we describe a procedure known as the bootstrap method which can be used to determine zero rates.

Consider the data in Table 4.3 on the prices of five bonds. Because the first three bonds pay no coupons, the zero rates corresponding to the maturities of these bonds

Table 4.3 Data for bootstrap method.

<table><tr><td>Bond principal ($)</td><td>Time to maturity (years)</td><td>Annual coupon* ($)</td><td>Bond price ($)</td><td>Bond yield** (\%)</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0.25</td><td>0</td><td>99.6</td><td>1.6064 (Q)</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0.50</td><td>0</td><td>99.0</td><td>2.0202 (SA)</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>1.00</td><td>0</td><td>97.8</td><td>2.2495 (A)</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>1.50</td><td>4</td><td>102.5</td><td>2.2949 (SA)</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>2.00</td><td>5</td><td>105.0</td><td>2.4238 (SA)</td></tr></table>

*Half the stated coupon is assumed to be paid every 6 months. **Compounding frequency corresponds to payment frequency: Q = quarterly, SA = semiannual, A = annual.

can easily be calculated. The 3-month bond has the effect of turning an investment of 99.6 into 100 in 3 months. The continuously compounded 3-month rate  $R$  is therefore given by solving

$$
1 0 0 = 9 9. 6 e ^ {R \times 0. 2 5}
$$

It is  $1.603\%$  per annum. The 6-month continuously compounded rate is similarly given by solving

$$
1 0 0 = 9 9. 0 e ^ {R \times 0. 5}
$$

It is  $2.010\%$  per annum. Similarly, the 1-year rate with continuous compounding is given by solving

$$
1 0 0 = 9 7. 8 e ^ {R \times 1. 0}
$$

It is  $2.225\%$  per annum.

The fourth bond lasts 1.5 years. Because coupons are paid semiannually, the cash flows it provides are as follows:

6 months: 2

1 year: 2

1.5 years: 102.

From our earlier calculations, we know that the discount rate for the payment at the end of 6 months is  $2.010\%$  and that the discount rate for the payment at the end of 1 year is  $2.225\%$ . We also know that the bond's price, $102.5, must equal the present value of all the payments received by the bondholder. Suppose the 1.5-year zero rate is denoted by  $R$ . It follows that

$$
2 e ^ {- 0. 0 2 0 1 0 \times 0. 5} + 2 e ^ {- 0. 0 2 2 2 5 \times 1. 0} + 1 0 2 e ^ {- R \times 1. 5} = 1 0 2. 5
$$

This reduces to

$$ e ^ {- 1. 5 R} = 0. 9 6 6 3 1
$$ or


$$

R = - \frac {\ln (0 . 9 6 6 3 1)}{1 . 5} = 0. 0 2 2 8 4

$$

The 1.5-year zero rate is therefore  $2.284\%$ . This is the only zero rate that is consistent with the 6-month rate, 1-year rate, and the data in Table 4.3.

The 2-year zero rate can be calculated similarly from the 6-month, 1-year, and 1.5-year zero rates, and the information on the last bond in Table 4.3. If  $R$  is the 2-year zero rate, then

$$
2. 5 e ^ {- 0. 0 2 0 1 0 \times 0. 5} + 2. 5 e ^ {- 0. 0 2 2 2 5 \times 1. 0} + 2. 5 e ^ {- 0. 0 2 2 8 4 \times 1. 5} + 1 0 2. 5 e ^ {- R \times 2. 0} = 1 0 5
$$

This gives  $R = 0.02416$ , or  $2.416\%$ .

The rates we have calculated are summarized in Table 4.4. A chart showing the zero rate as a function of maturity is known as the zero curve. A common assumption is that the zero curve is linear between the points determined using the bootstrap method. (This means that the 1.25-year zero rate is  $0.5 \times 2.225 + 0.5 \times 2.284 = 2.255\%$  in our example.) It is also usually assumed that the zero curve is horizontal prior to the first point and horizontal beyond the last point. Figure 4.1 shows the zero curve for our data using these assumptions. By using longer maturity bonds, the zero curve would be more accurately determined beyond 2 years.

Table 4.4 Continuously compounded zero rates determined from data in Table 4.3.

<table><tr><td>Maturity (years)</td><td>Zero rate(\% continuously compounded)</td></tr><tr><td>0.25</td><td>1.603</td></tr><tr><td>0.50</td><td>2.010</td></tr><tr><td>1.00</td><td>2.225</td></tr><tr><td>1.50</td><td>2.284</td></tr><tr><td>2.00</td><td>2.416</td></tr></table>

In practice, we do not usually have bonds with maturities equal to exactly 1.5 years, 2 years, 2.5 years, and so on. One approach is to interpolate between the bond price data before it is used to calculate the zero curve. For example, if it is known that a 2.3-year bond with a coupon of  $6\%$  sells for 108 and a 2.7-year bond with a coupon of  $6.5\%$  sells for 109, it might be assumed that a 2.5-year bond with a coupon of  $6.25\%$  would sell for 108.5. Another more general procedure is as follows. Define  $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n$  as the maturities of the instruments whose prices are to be matched. Assume a piecewise linear curve with corners at these times. Use an iterative "trial and error" procedure to determine the rate at time  $t_1$  that matches the price of the first instrument, then use a similar procedure to determine the rate at time  $t_2$  that matches the price of the second instrument, and so on. For any trial rate, the rates used for coupons are determined by linear interpolation.

A more sophisticated approach is to use polynomial or exponential functions, rather than linear functions, for the zero curve between times  $t_i$  and  $t_{i+1}$  for all  $i$ . The functions are chosen so that they price the bonds correctly and so that the gradient of the zero curve does not change at any of the  $t_i$ . This is referred to as using a spline function for the zero curve.

# 4.8 FORWARD RATES

Forward interest rates are the rates of interest implied by current zero rates for periods of time in the future. To illustrate how they are calculated, we suppose that zero rates are as shown in the second column of Table 4.5. The rates are assumed to be continuously compounded. Thus, the 3\% per annum rate for 1 year means that, in return for an investment of \100 today, an amount 100e^{0.03\times 1} = \103.05 is received in 1 year; the 4\% per annum rate for 2 years means that, in return for an investment of \100 today, an amount 100e^{0.04\times 2} = \$108.33 is received in 2 years; and so on.

The forward interest rate in Table 4.5 for year 2 is  $5\%$  per annum. This is the rate of interest that is implied by the zero rates for the period of time between the end of the first year and the end of the second year. It can be calculated from the 1-year zero interest rate of  $3\%$  per annum and the 2-year zero interest rate of  $4\%$  per annum. It is the rate of interest for year 2 that, when combined with  $3\%$  per annum for year 1, gives  $4\%$  overall for the 2 years. To show that the correct answer is  $5\%$  per annum, suppose that $100 is invested. A rate of  $3\%$  for the first year and  $5\%$  for the second year gives

$$

1 0 0 e ^ {0. 0 3 \times 1} e ^ {0. 0 5 \times 1} = \$ 1 0 8. 3 3

$$ at the end of the second year. A rate of  $4 \%$  per annum for 2 years gives

$$
1 0 0 e ^ {0. 0 4 \times 2}
$$ which is also 108.33. This example illustrates the general result that when interest rates are continuously compounded and rates in successive time periods are combined, the overall equivalent rate is simply the average rate during the whole period. In our example, 3\% for the first year and 5\% for the second year average to 4\% over the 2 years. The result is only approximately true when the rates are not continuously compounded.


The forward rate for year 3 is the rate of interest that is implied by a  $4\%$  per annum 2-year zero rate and a  $4.6\%$  per annum 3-year zero rate. It is  $5.8\%$  per annum. The reason is that an investment for 2 years at  $4\%$  per annum combined with an investment for one year at  $5.8\%$  per annum gives an overall average return for the three years of  $4.6\%$  per annum. The other forward rates can be calculated similarly and are shown in the third column of the table. In general, if  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$  are the zero rates for maturities

Table 4.5 Calculation of forward rates.

<table><tr><td>Year (n)</td><td>Zero rate for an n-year investment
(\% per annum)</td><td>Forward rate for nth year
(\% per annum)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>3.0</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>4.0</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>4.6</td><td>5.8</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5.0</td><td>6.2</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5.3</td><td>6.5</td></tr></table>

$T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , respectively, and  $R_{F}$  is the forward interest rate for the period of time between  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , then

$$

R _ {F} = \frac {R _ {2} T _ {2} - R _ {1} T _ {1}}{T _ {2} - T _ {1}} \tag {4.5}

$$

To illustrate this formula, consider the calculation of the year-4 forward rate from the data in Table 4.5:  $T_{1} = 3$ ,  $T_{2} = 4$ ,  $R_{1} = 0.046$ , and  $R_{2} = 0.05$ , and the formula gives  $R_{F} = 0.062$ .

Equation (4.5) can be written as

$$

R _ {F} = R _ {2} + \left(R _ {2} - R _ {1}\right) \frac {T _ {1}}{T _ {2} - T _ {1}} \tag {4.6}

$$

This shows that, if the zero curve is upward sloping between  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$  so that  $R_{2} > R_{1}$ , then  $R_{F} > R_{2}$  (i.e., the forward rate for a period of time ending at  $T_{2}$  is greater than the  $T_{2}$  zero rate). Similarly, if the zero curve is downward sloping with  $R_{2} < R_{1}$ , then  $R_{F} < R_{2}$  (i.e., the forward rate is less than the  $T_{2}$  zero rate). Taking limits as  $T_{2}$  approaches  $T_{1}$  in equation (4.6) and letting the common value of the two be  $T$ , we obtain

$$

R _ {F} = R + T \frac {\partial R}{\partial T}

$$ where  $R$  is the zero rate for a maturity of  $T$ . The value of  $R_{F}$  obtained in this way is known as the instantaneous forward rate for a maturity of  $T$ . This is the forward rate that is applicable to a very short future time period that begins at time  $T$ . Define  $P(0, T)$  as the price of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time  $T$ . Because  $P(0, T) = e^{-RT}$ , the equation for the instantaneous forward rate can also be written as

$$
R _ {F} = - \frac {\partial}{\partial T} \ln P (0, T)
$$

If a large financial institution can borrow or lend at the rates in Table 4.5, it can lock in the forward rates. For example, it can borrow 100 at 3\% for 1 year and invest the money at 4\% for 2 years, the result is a cash outflow of 100e^{0.03 \times 1} = 103.05 at the end of year 1 and an inflow of 100e^{0.04 \times 2} = 108.33 at the end of year 2. Since 108.33 = 103.05e^{0.05}, a return equal to the forward rate (5\%) is earned on 103.05 during the second year. Alternatively, it can borrow 100 for 4 years at 5\% and invest it for 3 years at 4.6\%. The result is a cash inflow of 100e^{0.046 \times 3} = 114.80 at the end of the third year and a cash outflow of 100e^{0.05 \times 4} = 122.14 at the end of the fourth year. Since 122.14 = 114.80e^{0.062}, money is being borrowed for the fourth year at the forward rate of 6.2\%.

If a large investor thinks that rates in the future will be different from today's forward rates, there are many trading strategies that the investor will find attractive (see Business Snapshot 4.1). One of these involves entering into a contract known as a forward rate agreement. We will now discuss how this contract works and how it is valued.

# 4.9 FORWARD RATE AGREEMENTS

A forward rate agreement (FRA) is an agreement to exchange a predetermined fixed rate for a reference rate that will be observed in the market at a future time. Both rates

# Business Snapshot 4.1 Orange County's Yield Curve Plays

Suppose a large investor can borrow or lend at the rates given in Table 4.5 and thinks that 1-year interest rates will not change much over the next 5 years. The investor can borrow 1-year funds and invest for 5-years. The 1-year borrowings can be rolled over for further 1-year periods at the end of the first, second, third, and fourth years. If interest rates do stay about the same, this strategy will yield a profit of about  $2.3\%$  per year, because interest will be received at  $5.3\%$  and paid at  $3\%$ . This type of trading strategy is known as a yield curve play. The investor is speculating that rates in the future will be quite different from the forward rates observed in the market today. (In our example, forward rates observed in the market today for future 1-year periods are  $5\%$ ,  $5.8\%$ ,  $6.2\%$ , and  $6.5\%$ .)

Robert Citron, the Treasurer at Orange County, used yield curve plays similar to the one we have just described very successfully in 1992 and 1993. The profit from Mr. Citron's trades became an important contributor to Orange County's budget and he was re-elected. (No one listened to his opponent in the election, who said his trading strategy was too risky.)

In 1994 Mr. Citron expanded his yield curve plays. He invested heavily in inverse floaters. These pay a rate of interest equal to a fixed rate of interest minus a floating rate. He also leveraged his position by borrowing in the repo market. If short-term interest rates had remained the same or declined he would have continued to do well. As it happened, interest rates rose sharply during 1994. On December 1, 1994, Orange County announced that its investment portfolio had lost 1.5 billion and several days later it filed for bankruptcy protection.

are applied to a specified principal, but the principal itself is not exchanged. Historically, the reference rate has usually been LIBOR. Consider an agreement to exchange 3\% for three-month LIBOR in two years with both rates being applied to a principal of \100 million. One side (Party A) would agree to pay LIBOR and receive the fixed rate of 3\%. The other side (Party B) would agree to receive LIBOR and pay the fixed rate of 3\%. Assume all rates are compounded quarterly (as would usually be the case). If three-month LIBOR proved to be 3.5\% in two years, Party A would receive

$$
\$ 100,000,000 \times (0.035 - 0.030) \times 0.25 = \$ 125,000
$$ and Party B would pay this amount. The payment would be due at time 2.25 years. $^4$


As LIBOR is phased out, we can expect to see more FRAs based on floating rates such as three-month SOFR and three-month SONIA. FRAs are a way of locking in the rate that will be paid or received in the future. For example, a trader who is due to receive a rate based on three-month SOFR on a certain principal during a certain future time period can lock in the rate by entering into an FRA where SOFR is paid and a fixed rate is received. Similarly, a trader who is due to pay a rate based on three-month SOFR on a certain principal during a certain future time period can lock in the rate by entering into an FRA where SOFR is received and a fixed rate is paid.

When the fixed rate equals the relevant forward rate the value of an FRA is zero. For example, when the reference rate is three-month SOFR, an FRA would be worth zero when the fixed rate equals the forward three-month SOFR rate. When an FRA is first set up the fixed rate is normally equal to the forward rate, so that its value is zero. As time passes, the forward rate is liable to change. Suppose that, at a particular time, we define:

$R_{K}$ : the fixed rate agreed to in the FRA

$R_{F}$ : the current forward rate for the reference rate

$\tau$ : the period of time to which the rates apply (three months in the above example)

$L$ : the principal in the contract.

We can compare

1. the FRA under consideration
2. a similar FRA where the fixed rate is the forward rate,  $R_{F}$ .

For the party receiving the fixed rate, the only difference between the two FRAs is that the cash flow at maturity for the first FRA is  $\tau(R_K - R_F)L$  more than that for the second FRA. (This amount can be positive or negative.) We know that the second FRA is worth zero. It follows that the first FRA is worth the present value of  $\tau(R_K - R_F)L$ . Similarly, for the party that pays the fixed rate, the FRA is worth the present value of  $\tau(R_F - R_K)L$ .

An important implication of these results is that an FRA can be valued by assuming that the forward interest rate for the underlying reference rate will be the one that determines the exchange.

# Example 4.3

Suppose that the forward SOFR rate for the period between time 1.5 years and time 2 years in the future is  $5\%$  (with semiannual compounding) and that some time ago a company entered into an FRA where it will receive  $5.8\%$  (with semiannual compounding) and pay SOFR on a principal of $100 million for the period. The 2-year (SOFR) risk-free rate is  $4\%$  (with continuous compounding). The value of the FRA is

$$

1 0 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 \times (0. 0 5 8 - 0. 0 5 0) \times 0. 5 e ^ {- 0. 0 4 \times 2} = \$ 3 6 9, 2 0 0

$$

# 4.10 DURATION

The duration of a bond, as its name implies, is a measure of how long the holder of the bond has to wait before receiving the present value of the cash payments. A zero-coupon bond that lasts  $n$  years has a duration of  $n$  years. However, a coupon-bearing bond lasting  $n$  years has a duration of less than  $n$  years, because the holder receives some of the cash payments prior to year  $n$ .

Suppose that a bond provides the holder with cash flows  $c_{i}$  at time  $t_i$  ( $1 \leq i \leq n$ ). The bond price  $B$  and bond yield  $y$  (continuously compounded) are related by

$$

B = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} c _ {i} e ^ {- y t _ {i}} \tag {4.7}

$$

The duration of the bond,  $D$ , is defined as

$$

D = \frac {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} t _ {i} c _ {i} e ^ {- y t _ {i}}}{B} \tag {4.8}

$$

This can be written

$$

D = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} t _ {i} \left[ \frac {c _ {i} e ^ {- y t _ {i}}}{B} \right]

$$

The term in square brackets is the ratio of the present value of the cash flow at time  $t_i$  to the bond price. The bond price is the present value of all payments. The duration is therefore a weighted average of the times when payments are made, with the weight applied to time  $t_i$  being equal to the proportion of the bond's total present value provided by the cash flow at time  $t_i$ . The sum of the weights is 1.0. Note that, for the purposes of the definition of duration, all discounting is done at the bond yield rate of interest,  $y$ . (We do not use a different zero rate for each cash flow in the way described in Section 4.6.)

When a small change  $\Delta y$  in the yield is considered, it is approximately true that

$$

\Delta B = \frac {d B}{d y} \Delta y \tag {4.9}

$$

From equation (4.7), this becomes

$$

\Delta B = - \Delta y \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} c _ {i} t _ {i} e ^ {- y t _ {i}} \tag {4.10}

$$

(Note that there is a negative relationship between  $B$  and  $y$ . When bond yields increase, bond prices decrease. When bond yields decrease, bond prices increase.) From equations (4.8) and (4.10), the key duration relationship is obtained:

$$

\Delta B = - B D \Delta y \tag {4.11}

$$

This can be written

$$

\frac {\Delta B}{B} = - D \Delta y \tag {4.12}

$$

Equation (4.12) is an approximate relationship between percentage changes in a bond price and changes in its yield. It is easy to use and is the reason why duration, first suggested by Frederick Macaulay in 1938, has become such a popular measure.

Consider a 3-year  $10\%$  coupon bond with a face value of \ $100. Suppose that the yield on the bond is 12\%$  per annum with continuous compounding. This means that  $y = 0.12$ . Coupon payments of \5 are made every 6 months. Table 4.6 shows the calculations necessary to determine the bond's duration. The present values of the bond's cash flows, using the yield as the discount rate, are shown in column 3 (e.g., the present value of the first cash flow is  $5e^{-0.12 \times 0.5} = 4.709$ ). The sum of the numbers in column 3 gives the bond's price as 94.213. The weights are calculated by dividing the numbers in column 3 by 94.213. The sum of the numbers in column 5 gives the duration as 2.653 years.

DV01 is the price change from a 1-basis-point increase in all rates. Gamma is the change in DV01 from a 1-basis-point increase in all rates. The following example investigates the accuracy of the duration relationship in equation (4.11).

Table 4.6 Calculation of duration.

<table><tr><td>Time (years)</td><td>Cash flow ($)</td><td>Present value</td><td>Weight</td><td>Time × weight</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>5</td><td>4.709</td><td>0.050</td><td>0.025</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>5</td><td>4.435</td><td>0.047</td><td>0.047</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>5</td><td>4.176</td><td>0.044</td><td>0.066</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>5</td><td>3.933</td><td>0.042</td><td>0.083</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>5</td><td>3.704</td><td>0.039</td><td>0.098</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>105</td><td>73.256</td><td>0.778</td><td>2.333</td></tr><tr><td>Total:</td><td>130</td><td>94.213</td><td>1.000</td><td>2.653</td></tr></table>

# Example 4.4

For the bond in Table 4.6, the bond price,  $B$ , is 94.213 and the duration,  $D$ , is 2.653, so that equation (4.11) gives

$$

\Delta B = - 9 4. 2 1 3 \times 2. 6 5 3 \times \Delta y

$$ or


$$

\Delta B = - 2 4 9. 9 5 \times \Delta y

$$

When the yield on the bond increases by 10 basis points  $(= 0.1\%)$ ,  $\Delta y = +0.001$ . The duration relationship predicts that  $\Delta B = -249.95 \times 0.001 = -0.250$ , so that the bond price goes down to  $94.213 - 0.250 = 93.963$ . How accurate is this? Valuing the bond in terms of its yield in the usual way, we find that, when the bond yield increases by 10 basis points to  $12.1\%$ , the bond price is

$$

\begin{array}{l} 5 e ^ {- 0. 1 2 1 \times 0. 5} + 5 e ^ {- 0. 1 2 1 \times 1. 0} + 5 e ^ {- 0. 1 2 1 \times 1. 5} + 5 e ^ {- 0. 1 2 1 \times 2. 0} \\ + 5 e ^ {- 0. 1 2 1 \times 2. 5} + 1 0 5 e ^ {- 0. 1 2 1 \times 3. 0} = 9 3. 9 6 3 \\ \end{array}

$$ which is (to three decimal places) the same as that predicted by the duration relationship.


# Modified Duration

The preceding analysis is based on the assumption that  $y$  is expressed with continuous compounding. If  $y$  is expressed with annual compounding, it can be shown that the approximate relationship in equation (4.11) becomes

$$

\Delta B = - \frac {B D \Delta y}{1 + y}

$$

More generally, if  $y$  is expressed with a compounding frequency of  $m$  times per year, then

$$

\Delta B = - \frac {B D \Delta y}{1 + y / m}

$$

A variable  $D^{*}$ , defined by

$$

D ^ {*} = \frac {D}{1 + y / m}

$$ is sometimes referred to as the bond's modified duration. It allows the duration relationship to be simplified to


$$

\Delta B = - B D ^ {*} \Delta y \tag {4.13}

$$ when  $y$  is expressed with a compounding frequency of  $m$  times per year. The following example investigates the accuracy of the modified duration relationship.

# Example 4.5

The bond in Table 4.6 has a price of 94.213 and a duration of 2.653. The yield, expressed with semiannual compounding is  $12.3673\%$ . The modified duration,  $D^{*}$ , is given by

$$
D ^ {*} = \frac {2 . 6 5 3}{1 + 0 . 1 2 3 6 7 3 / 2} = 2. 4 9 9
$$

From equation (4.13),

$$
\Delta B = - 9 4. 2 1 3 \times 2. 4 9 9 \times \Delta y
$$ or


$$

\Delta B = - 2 3 5. 3 9 \times \Delta y

$$

When the yield (semiannually compounded) increases by 10 basis points  $(= 0.1\%)$ , we have  $\Delta y = +0.001$ . The duration relationship predicts that we expect  $\Delta B$  to be  $-235.39 \times 0.001 = -0.235$ , so that the bond price goes down to  $94.213 - 0.235 = 93.978$ . How accurate is this? An exact calculation similar to that in the previous example shows that, when the bond yield (semiannually compounded) increases by 10 basis points to  $12.4673\%$ , the bond price becomes 93.978. This shows that the modified duration calculation gives good accuracy for small yield changes.

Another term that is sometimes used is dollar duration. This is the product of modified duration and bond price, so that  $\Delta B = -D_{\S}\Delta y$ , where  $D_{\S}$  is dollar duration.

# Bond Portfolios

The duration,  $D$ , of a bond portfolio can be defined as a weighted average of the durations of the individual bonds in the portfolio, with the weights being proportional to the bond prices. Equations (4.11) to (4.13) then apply, with  $B$  being defined as the value of the bond portfolio. They estimate the change in the value of the bond portfolio for a small change  $\Delta y$  in the yields of all the bonds.

It is important to realize that, when duration is used for bond portfolios, there is an implicit assumption that the yields of all bonds will change by approximately the same amount. When the bonds have widely differing maturities, this happens only when there is a parallel shift in the zero-coupon yield curve. We should therefore interpret equations (4.11) to (4.13) as providing estimates of the impact on the price of a bond portfolio of a small parallel shift,  $\Delta y$ , in the zero curve.

By choosing a portfolio so that the duration of assets equals the duration of liabilities (i.e., the net duration is zero), a financial institution eliminates its exposure to small parallel shifts in the yield curve. But it is still exposed to shifts that are either large or nonparallel.

# 4.11 CONVEXITY

The duration relationship applies only to small changes in yields. This is illustrated in Figure 4.2, which shows the relationship between the percentage change in value and change in yield for two bond portfolios having the same duration. The gradients of the two curves are the same at the origin. This means that both bond portfolios change in value by the same percentage for small yield changes and is consistent with equation (4.12). For large yield changes, the portfolios behave differently. Portfolio  $X$  has more curvature in its relationship with yields than portfolio  $Y$ . A factor known as convexity measures this curvature and can be used to improve the relationship in equation (4.12).

A measure of convexity is

$$

C = \frac {1}{B} \frac {d ^ {2} B}{d y ^ {2}} = \frac {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} c _ {i} t _ {i} ^ {2} e ^ {- y t _ {i}}}{B}

$$

From Taylor series expansions, we obtain a more accurate expression than equation (4.9), given by

$$

\Delta B = \frac {d B}{d y} \Delta y + \frac {1}{2} \frac {d ^ {2} B}{d y ^ {2}} \Delta y ^ {2} \tag {4.14}

$$

This leads to

$$

\frac {\Delta B}{B} = - D \Delta y + \frac {1}{2} C (\Delta y) ^ {2}

$$

For a portfolio with a particular duration, the convexity of a bond portfolio tends to be greatest when the portfolio provides payments evenly over a long period of time. It is least when the payments are concentrated around one particular point in time. By choosing a portfolio of assets and liabilities with a net duration of zero and a net convexity of zero, a financial institution can make itself immune to relatively large parallel shifts in the zero curve. However, it is still exposed to nonparallel shifts.

# 4.12 THEORIES OF THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES

It is natural to ask what determines the shape of the zero curve. Why is it sometimes downward sloping, sometimes upward sloping, and sometimes partly upward sloping and partly downward sloping? A number of different theories have been proposed. The simplest is expectations theory, which conjectures that long-term interest rates should reflect expected future short-term interest rates. More precisely, it argues that a forward interest rate corresponding to a certain future period is equal to the expected future zero interest rate for that period. Another idea, market segmentation theory, conjectures that there need be no relationship between short-, medium-, and long-term interest rates. Under the theory, a major investor such as a large pension fund or an insurance company invests in bonds of a certain maturity and does not readily switch from one maturity to another. The short-term interest rate is determined by supply and demand in the short-term bond market; the medium-term interest rate is determined by supply and demand in the medium-term bond market; and so on.

The theory that is most appealing is liquidity preference theory. The basic assumption underlying the theory is that investors prefer to preserve their liquidity and invest funds for short periods of time. Borrowers, on the other hand, usually prefer to borrow at fixed rates for long periods of time. This leads to a situation in which forward rates are greater than expected future zero rates. The theory is also consistent with the empirical result that yield curves tend to be upward sloping more often than they are downward sloping.

# The Management of Net Interest Income

To understand liquidity preference theory, it is useful to consider the interest rate risk faced by banks when they take deposits and make loans. The net interest income of the bank is the excess of the interest received over the interest paid and needs to be carefully managed.

Consider a simple situation where a bank offers consumers a one-year and a five-year deposit rate as well as a one-year and five-year mortgage rate. The rates are shown in Table 4.7. We make the simplifying assumption that the expected one-year interest rate for future time periods is equal the one-year rates prevailing in the market today. Loosely speaking this means that the market considers interest rate increases to be just as likely as interest rate decreases. As a result, the rates in Table 4.7 are "fair" in that

Table 4.7 Example of rates offered by a bank to its customers.

<table><tr><td>Maturity (years)</td><td>Deposit rate</td><td>Mortgage rate</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>3\%</td><td>6\%</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3\%</td><td>6\%</td></tr></table>

Table 4.8 Five-year rates are increased in an attempt to match maturities of assets and liabilities.

<table><tr><td>Maturity (years)</td><td>Deposit rate</td><td>Mortgage rate</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>3\%</td><td>6\%</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>4\%</td><td>7\%</td></tr></table> they reflect the market's expectations (i.e., they correspond to expectations theory). Investing money for one year and reinvesting for four further one-year periods give the same expected overall return as a single five-year investment. Similarly, borrowing money for one year and refinancing each year for the next four years leads to the same expected financing costs as a single five-year loan.


Suppose you have money to deposit and agree with the prevailing view that interest rate increases are just as likely as interest rate decreases. Would you choose to deposit your money for one year at  $3\%$  per annum or for five years at  $3\%$  per annum? The chances are that you would choose one year because this gives you more financial flexibility. It ties up your funds for a shorter period of time.

Now suppose that you want a mortgage. Again you agree with the prevailing view that interest rate increases are just as likely as interest rate decreases. Would you choose a one-year mortgage at  $6\%$  or a five-year mortgage at  $6\%$ ? The chances are that you would choose a five-year mortgage because it fixes your borrowing rate for the next five years and subjects you to less refinancing risk.

When the bank posts the rates shown in Table 4.7, it is likely to find that the majority of its depositors opt for one-year deposits and the majority of its borrowers opt for five-year mortgages. This creates an asset/liability mismatch for the bank and subjects it to risks. There is no problem if interest rates fall. The bank will find itself financing the five-year  $6\%$  loans with deposits that cost less than  $3\%$  in the future and net interest income will increase. However, if rates rise, the deposits that are financing these  $6\%$  loans will cost more than  $3\%$  in the future and net interest income will decline. A  $3\%$  rise in interest rates would reduce the net interest income to zero.

It is the job of the asset/liability management group to ensure that the maturities of the assets on which interest is earned and the maturities of the liabilities on which interest is paid are matched. One way it can do this is by increasing the five-year rate on both deposits and mortgages. For example, it could move to the situation in Table 4.8 where the five-year deposit rate is  $4\%$  and the five-year mortgage rate  $7\%$ . This would make five-year deposits relatively more attractive and one-year mortgages relatively more attractive. Some customers who chose one-year deposits when the rates were as in Table 4.7 will switch to five-year deposits in the Table 4.8 situation. Some customers who chose five-year mortgages when the rates were as in Table 4.7 will choose one-year mortgages. This may lead to the maturities of assets and liabilities being matched. If there is still an imbalance with depositors tending to choose a one-year maturity and borrowers a five-year maturity, five-year deposit and mortgage rates could be increased even further. Eventually the imbalance will disappear.

The net result of all banks behaving in the way we have just described is liquidity preference theory. Long-term rates tend to be higher than those that would be predicted by expected future short-term rates. The yield curve is upward sloping most

# Business Snapshot 4.2 Liquidity and the 2007-2009 Financial Crisis

During the financial crisis that started in July 2007 there was a "flight to quality," where financial institutions and investors looked for safe investments and were less inclined than before to take credit risks. Financial institutions that relied on short-term funding experienced liquidity problems. One example is Northern Rock in the United Kingdom, which financed much of its mortgage portfolio with wholesale deposits, some lasting only 3 months. Starting in September 2007, the depositors became nervous and refused to roll over the funding they were providing to Northern Rock, i.e., at the end of a 3-month period they would refuse to deposit their funds for a further 3-month period. As a result, Northern Rock was unable to finance its assets. It was taken over by the U.K. government in early 2008. In the United States, financial institutions such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers experienced similar liquidity problems because they had chosen to fund part of their operations with short-term funds.

of the time. It is downward sloping only when the market expects a steep decline in short-term rates.

Many banks now have sophisticated systems for monitoring the decisions being made by customers so that, when they detect small differences between the maturities of the assets and liabilities being chosen by customers they can fine tune the rates they offer. Sometimes derivatives such as interest rate swaps are also used to manage their exposure. The result of all this is that net interest income is usually very stable. This has not always been the case. In the United States, the failure of Savings and Loan companies in the 1980s and the failure of Continental Illinois in 1984 were to a large extent a result of the fact that they did not match the maturities of assets and liabilities. Both failures proved to be very expensive for U.S. taxpayers.

# Liquidity

In addition to creating problems in the way that has been described, a portfolio where maturities are mismatched can lead to liquidity problems. Consider a financial institution that funds 5-year fixed rate loans with wholesale deposits that last only 3 months. It might recognize its exposure to rising interest rates and hedge its interest rate risk. (One way of doing this is by using interest rate swaps, as mentioned earlier.) However, it still has a liquidity risk. Wholesale depositors may, for some reason, lose confidence in the financial institution and refuse to continue to provide the financial institution with short-term funding. The financial institution, even if it has adequate equity capital, will then experience a severe liquidity problem that could lead to its downfall. As described in Business Snapshot 4.2, these types of liquidity problems were the root cause of some of the failures of financial institutions during the crisis that started in 2007.

# SUMMARY

The compounding frequency used for an interest rate defines the units in which it is measured. The difference between an annually compounded rate and a quarterly compounded rate is analogous to the difference between a distance measured in miles and a distance measured in kilometers. Traders frequently use continuous compounding when analyzing the value of options and more complex derivatives.


Many different types of interest rates are quoted in financial markets and calculated by analysts. The  $n$ -year zero or spot rate is the rate applicable to an investment lasting for  $n$  years when all of the return is realized at the end. The par yield on a bond of a certain maturity is the coupon rate that causes the bond to sell for its par value. Forward rates are the rates applicable to future periods of time implied by today's zero rates.

The method most commonly used to calculate zero rates is known as the bootstrap method. It involves starting with short-term instruments and moving progressively to longer-term instruments, making sure that the zero rates calculated at each stage are consistent with the prices of the instruments. It is used daily by trading desks to calculate a variety of zero curves.

A forward rate agreement (FRA) is an over-the-counter agreement where a floating rate will be exchanged for a specified interest rate with both rates being applied to a predetermined principal over a predetermined period.

An important concept in interest rate markets is duration. Duration measures the sensitivity of the value of a bond portfolio to a small parallel shift in the zero-coupon yield curve. Specifically,

$$

\Delta B = - B D \Delta y

$$ where  $B$  is the value of the bond portfolio,  $D$  is the duration of the portfolio,  $\Delta y$  is the size of a small parallel shift in the zero curve, and  $\Delta B$  is the resultant effect on the value of the bond portfolio.

Liquidity preference theory can be used to explain the interest rate term structures that are observed in practice. The theory argues that most entities like to borrow long and lend short. To match the maturities of borrowers and lenders, it is necessary for financial institutions to raise long-term rates so that forward interest rates are higher than expected future spot interest rates.

# Determination of Forward and Futures Prices

In this chapter we examine how forward prices and futures prices are related to the spot price of the underlying asset. Forward contracts are easier to analyze than futures contracts because there is no daily settlement—only a single payment at maturity. We therefore start this chapter by considering the relationship between the forward price and the spot price. Luckily it can be shown that the forward price and futures price of an asset are usually very close when the maturities of the two contracts are the same. This is convenient because it means that results obtained for forwards can be assumed to be true for futures.

In the first part of the chapter we derive some important general results on the relationship between forward (or futures) prices and spot prices. We then use the results to examine the relationship between futures prices and spot prices for contracts on stock indices, foreign exchange, and commodities. We will consider interest rate futures contracts in the next chapter.

# 5.1 INVESTMENT ASSETS VS. CONSUMPTION ASSETS

When considering forward and futures contracts, it is important to distinguish between investment assets and consumption assets. An investment asset is an asset that is held solely for investment purposes by at least some traders. Stocks and bonds are clearly investment assets. Gold and silver are also examples of investment assets. Note that investment assets do not have to be held exclusively for investment. (Silver, for example, has a number of industrial uses.) However, they do have to satisfy the requirement that they are held by some traders solely for investment. A consumption asset is an asset that is held primarily for consumption. It is not normally held for investment. Examples of consumption assets are commodities such as copper, crude oil, corn, and pork bellies.

As we shall see later in this chapter, we can use arbitrage arguments to determine the forward and futures prices of an investment asset from its spot price and other observable market variables. We cannot do this for consumption assets.

# 5.2 SHORT SELLING

Some of the arbitrage strategies presented in this chapter involve short selling. This trade, usually simply referred to as "shorting", involves selling an asset that is not owned. It is something that is possible for some—but not all—investment assets. We will illustrate how it works by considering a short sale of shares of a stock.

Suppose an investor instructs a broker to short 500 shares of company X. The broker will carry out the instructions by borrowing the shares from someone who owns them and selling them in the market in the usual way. At some later stage, the investor will close out the position by purchasing 500 shares of company X in the market. These shares are then used to replace the borrowed shares so that the short position is closed out. The investor takes a profit if the stock price has declined and a loss if it has risen. If at any time while the contract is open the broker has to return the borrowed shares and there are no other shares that can be borrowed, the investor is forced to close out the position, even if not ready to do so. Often a fee is charged for lending the shares to the party doing the shorting.

An investor with a short position must pay to the broker any income, such as dividends or interest, that would normally be received on the securities that have been shorted. The broker will transfer this income to the account of the client from whom the securities have been borrowed. Consider the position of an investor who shorts 500 shares in April when the price per share is $120 and closes out the position by buying them back in July when the price per share is $100. Suppose that a dividend of $1 per share is paid in May. The investor receives 500 × $120 = $60,000 in April when the short position is initiated. The dividend leads to a payment by the investor of 500 × $1 = $500 in May. The investor also pays 500 × $100 = 50,000 for shares when the position is closed out in July. The net gain, therefore, is

$$
\$ 60,000 - \$ 500 - \$ 50,000 = \$ 9,500
$$ when any fee for borrowing the shares is ignored. Table 5.1 illustrates this example and shows that the cash flows from the short sale are the mirror image of the cash flows from purchasing the shares in April and selling them in July. (Again, the fee for borrowing the shares is not considered.)


Table 5.1 Cash flows from short sale and purchase of shares.

The investor is required to maintain a margin account with the broker. The margin account consists of cash or marketable securities deposited by the investor with the broker to guarantee that the investor will not walk away from the short position if the share price increases. It is similar to the margin account discussed in Chapter 2 for futures contracts. An initial margin is required and if there are adverse movements (i.e., increases) in the price of the asset that is being shorted, additional margin may be required. If the additional margin is not provided, the short position is closed out. The margin account does not represent a cost to the investor. This is because interest is usually paid on the balance in margin accounts and, if the interest rate offered is unacceptable, marketable securities such as Treasury bills can be used to meet margin requirements. The proceeds of the sale of the asset belong to the investor and normally form part of the initial margin.

From time to time regulations are changed on short selling. In 1938, the uptick rule was introduced. This allowed shares to be shorted only on an "uptick"—that is, when the most recent movement in the share price was an increase. The SEC abolished the uptick rule in July 2007, but introduced an "alternative uptick" rule in February 2010. Under this rule, when the price of a stock has decreased by more than  $10\%$  in one day, there are restrictions on short selling for that day and the next. These restrictions are that the stock can be shorted only at a price that is higher than the best current bid price. Occasionally there are temporary bans on short selling. This happened in a number of countries in 2008 because it was considered that short selling contributed to the high market volatility that was being experienced.

# 5.3 ASSUMPTIONS AND NOTATION

In this chapter we will assume that the following are all true for some market participants:

1. The market participants are subject to no transaction costs when they trade.
2. The market participants are subject to the same tax rate on all net trading profits.
3. The market participants can borrow money at the same risk-free rate of interest as they can lend money.
4. The market participants take advantage of arbitrage opportunities as they occur.

Note that we do not require these assumptions to be true for all market participants. All that we require is that they be true—or at least approximately true—for a few key market participants such as large derivatives dealers. It is the trading activities of these key market participants and their eagerness to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities as they occur that determine the relationship between forward and spot prices.

The following notation will be used throughout this chapter:

$T$ : Time until delivery date in a forward or futures contract (in years)

$S_0$ : Price of the asset underlying the forward or futures contract today

$F_0$ : Forward or futures price today

$r$ : Zero-coupon risk-free rate of interest per annum, expressed with continuous compounding, for an investment maturing at the delivery date (i.e., in  $T$  years).

The risk-free rate,  $r$ , is the interest rate at which money is borrowed or lent when there is no credit risk, so that the borrowed money is certain to be repaid. As discussed in Chapter 4, participants in derivatives markets use overnight rates and rates derived from overnight rates as risk-free rates.

# 5.4 FORWARD PRICE FOR AN INVESTMENT ASSET

The easiest forward contract to value is one written on an investment asset that provides the holder with no income and for which there are no storage costs. Non-dividend-paying stocks and zero-coupon bonds are examples of such investment assets.

Consider a long forward contract to purchase a non-dividend-paying stock in 3 months. Assume the current stock price is 40 and the 3-month risk-free interest rate is 5\% per annum.

Suppose first that the forward price is relatively high at $43. An arbitrageur can borrow $40 at the risk-free interest rate of 5\% per annum, buy one share, and short a forward contract to sell one share in 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, the arbitrageur delivers the share and receives 43. The sum of money required to pay off the loan is

$$

4 0 e ^ {0. 0 5 \times 3 / 1 2} = \$ 4 0. 5 0

$$

By following this strategy, the arbitrageur locks in a profit of $43.00 - $40.50 = 2.50 at the end of the 3-month period.

Suppose next that the forward price is relatively low at $39. An arbitrageur can short one share, invest the proceeds of the short sale at 5\% per annum for 3 months, and take a long position in a 3-month forward contract. The proceeds of the short sale grow to 40e^0.05×3/12 or $40.50 in 3 months. At the end of the 3 months, the arbitrageur pays 39, takes delivery of the share under the terms of the forward contract, and uses it to close out the short position. A net gain of

$$

\$ 40.50 - \$ 39.00 = \$ 1.50

$$ is therefore made at the end of the 3 months. The two trading strategies we have considered are summarized in Table 5.2.


Under what circumstances do arbitrage opportunities such as those in Table 5.2 not exist? The first arbitrage works when the forward price is greater than  $40.50. The second arbitrage works when the forward price is less than$ 40.50. We deduce that for there to be no arbitrage the forward price must be exactly 40.50.

# A Generalization

To generalize this example, we consider a forward contract on an investment asset with price  $S_0$  that provides no income. Using our notation,  $T$  is the time to maturity,  $r$  is the risk-free rate, and  $F_0$  is the forward price. The relationship between  $F_0$  and  $S_0$  is

$$

F _ {0} = S _ {0} e ^ {r T} \tag {5.1}

$$

Table 5.2 Arbitrage opportunities when forward price is out of line with spot price for asset providing no income. (Asset price = 40; interest rate = 5\%; maturity of forward contract = 3 months.)

<table><tr><td>Forward Price = $43</td><td>Forward Price = $39</td></tr><tr><td>Action now:</td><td>Action now:</td></tr><tr><td>Borrow $40 at 5\% for 3 months</td><td>Short 1 unit of asset to realize $40</td></tr><tr><td>Buy one unit of asset</td><td>Invest $40 at 5\% for 3 months</td></tr><tr><td>Enter into forward contract to sell asset in 3 months for $43</td><td>Enter into a forward contract to buy asset in 3 months for $39</td></tr><tr><td>Action in 3 months:</td><td>Action in 3 months:</td></tr><tr><td>Sell asset for $43</td><td>Buy asset for $39</td></tr><tr><td>Use $40.50 to repay loan with interest</td><td>Close short position</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Receive $40.50 from investment</td></tr><tr><td>Profit realized = $2.50</td><td>Profit realized = 1.50</td></tr></table>

If  $F_0 > S_0 e^{rT}$ , arbitrageurs can buy the asset and short forward contracts on the asset. If  $F_0 < S_0 e^{rT}$ , they can short the asset and enter into long forward contracts on it. In our example,  $S_0 = 40$ ,  $r = 0.05$ , and  $T = 0.25$ , so that equation (5.1) gives

$$

F _ {0} = 4 0 e ^ {0. 0 5 \times 0. 2 5} = \$ 4 0. 5 0

$$ which is in agreement with our earlier calculations.


A long forward contract and a spot purchase both lead to the asset being owned at time  $T$ . The forward price is higher than the spot price because of the cost of financing the spot purchase of the asset during the life of the forward contract. This point was overlooked by Kidder Peabody in 1994, much to its cost (see Business Snapshot 5.1).

# Example 5.1

Consider a 4-month forward contract to buy a zero-coupon bond that will mature 1 year from today. (This means that the bond will have 8 months to go when the forward contract matures.) The current price of the bond is 930. We assume that the 4-month risk-free rate of interest (continuously compounded) is 6\% per annum. Because zero-coupon bonds provide no income, we can use equation (5.1) with T = 4 / 12, r = 0.06, and S_0 = 930. The forward price, F_0, is given by

$$

F _ {0} = 9 3 0 e ^ {0. 0 6 \times 4 / 1 2} = \$ 9 4 8. 7 9

$$

This would be the delivery price in a contract negotiated today.

# Business Snapshot 5.1 Kidder Peabody's Embarrassing Mistake

Investment banks have developed a way of creating a zero-coupon bond, called a strip, from a coupon-bearing Treasury bond by selling each of the cash flows underlying the coupon-bearing bond as a separate security. Joseph Jett, a trader working for Kidder Peabody, had a relatively simple trading strategy. He would buy strips and sell them in the forward market. As equation (5.1) shows, the forward price of a security providing no income is always higher than the spot price. Suppose, for example, that the 3-month interest rate is 4\% per annum and the spot price of a strip is \$70. The 3-month forward price of the strip is 70e^{0.04 \times 3/12} = \$70.70.

Kidder Peabody's computer system reported a profit on each of Jett's trades equal to the excess of the forward price over the spot price (0.70 in our example). In fact, this profit was nothing more than the cost of financing the purchase of the strip. But, by rolling his contracts forward, Jett was able to prevent this cost from accruing to him.

The result was that the system reported a profit of  $100 million on Jett's trading (and Jett received a big bonus) when in fact there was a loss in the region of$ 350 million. This shows that even large financial institutions can get relatively simple things wrong!

# What If Short Sales Are Not Possible?

Short sales are not possible for all investment assets and sometimes a fee is charged for borrowing assets. As it happens, this does not matter. To derive equation (5.1), we do not need to be able to short the asset. All that we require is that there be market participants who hold the asset purely for investment (and by definition this is always true of an investment asset). If the forward price is too low, they will find it attractive to sell the asset and take a long position in a forward contract.

We continue to consider the case where the underlying investment asset gives rise to no storage costs or income. If  $F_0 > S_0 e^{rT}$ , an investor can adopt the following strategy:

1. Borrow  $S_0$  dollars at an interest rate  $r$  for  $T$  years.
2. Buy 1 unit of the asset.
3. Enter into a forward contract to sell 1 unit of the asset.

At time  $T$ , the asset is sold for  $F_0$ . An amount  $S_0e^{rT}$  is required to repay the loan at this time and the investor makes a profit of  $F_0 - S_0e^{rT}$ .

Suppose next that  $F_0 < S_0 e^{rT}$ . In this case, an investor who owns the asset can:

1. Sell the asset for  $S_0$ .
2. Invest the proceeds at interest rate  $r$  for time  $T$ .
3. Enter into a forward contract to buy 1 unit of the asset.

At time  $T$ , the cash invested has grown to  $S_0e^{rT}$ . The asset is repurchased for  $F_0$  and the investor makes a profit of  $S_0e^{rT} - F_0$  relative to the position the investor would have been in if the asset had been kept.

As in the non-dividend-paying stock example considered earlier, we can expect the forward price to adjust so that neither of the two arbitrage opportunities we have considered exists. This means that the relationship in equation (5.1) must hold.

# 5.5 KNOWN INCOME

In this section we consider a forward contract on an investment asset that will provide a perfectly predictable cash income to the holder. Examples are stocks paying known dividends and coupon-bearing bonds. We adopt the same approach as in the previous section. We first look at a numerical example and then review the formal arguments.

Consider a forward contract to purchase a coupon-bearing bond whose current price is  $900. We will suppose that the forward contract matures in 9 months. We will also suppose that a coupon payment of$ 40 is expected on the bond after 4 months. We assume that the 4-month and 9-month risk-free interest rates (continuously compounded) are, respectively, 3\% and 4\% per annum.

Suppose first that the forward price is relatively high at $910. An arbitrageur can borrow $900 to buy the bond and enter into the forward contract to sell the bond for $910. The coupon payment has a present value of 40e-0.03×4/12 = $39.60. Of the $900, $39.60 is therefore borrowed at 3\% per annum for 4 months so that it can be repaid with the coupon payment. The remaining $860.40 is borrowed at 4\% per annum for 9 months. The amount owing at the end of the 9-month period is 860.40e^0.04×0.75 = $886.60. A sum of 910 is received for the bond under the terms of the forward contract. The arbitrageur therefore makes a net profit of

$$

9 1 0. 0 0 - 8 8 6. 6 0 = \$ 2 3. 4 0

$$

Suppose next that the forward price is relatively low at $870. An investor can short the bond and enter into the forward contract to buy the bond for $870. Of the $900 realized from shorting the bond, $39.60 is invested for 4 months at 3\% per annum so that it grows into an amount sufficient to pay the coupon on the bond. The remaining $860.40 is invested for 9 months at 4\% per annum and grows to $886.60. Under the terms of the forward contract, 870 is paid to buy the bond and the short position is closed out. The investor therefore gains

$$

8 8 6. 6 0 - 8 7 0 = \$ 1 6. 6 0

$$

The two strategies we have considered are summarized in Table 5.3. $^{3}$  The first strategy in Table 5.3 produces a profit when the forward price is greater than  $886.60, whereas the second strategy produces a profit when the forward price is less than$ 886.60. It follows that if there are no arbitrage opportunities then the forward price must be 886.60.

# A Generalization

We can generalize from this example to argue that, when an investment asset will provide income with a present value of  $I$  during the life of a forward contract, we have

$$

F _ {0} = \left(S _ {0} - I\right) e ^ {r T} \tag {5.2}

$$

Table 5.3 Arbitrage opportunities when 9-month forward price is out of line with spot price for asset providing known cash income. (Asset price = $900; income of $40 occurs at 4 months; 4-month and 9-month rates are, respectively, 3\% and 4\% per annum.)

<table><tr><td>Forward price = $910</td><td>Forward price = $870</td></tr><tr><td>Action now:</td><td>Action now:</td></tr><tr><td>Borrow $900: $39.60 for 4 months and $860.40 for 9 months</td><td>Short 1 unit of asset to realize $900</td></tr><tr><td>Buy 1 unit of asset</td><td>Invest $39.60 for 4 months and $860.40 for 9 months</td></tr><tr><td>Enter into forward contract to sell asset in 9 months for $910</td><td>Enter into a forward contract to buy asset in 9 months for $870</td></tr><tr><td>Action in 4 months:</td><td>Action in 4 months:</td></tr><tr><td>Receive $40 of income on asset</td><td>Receive $40 from 4-month investment</td></tr><tr><td>Use $40 to repay first loan with interest</td><td>Pay income of $40 on asset</td></tr><tr><td>Action in 9 months:</td><td>Action in 9 months:</td></tr><tr><td>Sell asset for $910</td><td>Receive $886.60 from 9-month investment</td></tr><tr><td>Use $886.60 to repay second loan with interest</td><td>Buy asset for $870</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Close out short position</td></tr><tr><td>Profit realized = $23.40</td><td>Profit realized = $16.60</td></tr></table>

In our example,  $S_0 = 900.00$ ,  $I = 40e^{-0.03\times 4 / 12} = 39.60$ ,  $r = 0.04$ , and  $T = 0.75$ , so that

$$

F _ {0} = (9 0 0. 0 0 - 3 9. 6 0) e ^ {0. 0 4 \times 0. 7 5} = \$ 8 8 6. 6 0

$$

This is in agreement with our earlier calculation. Equation (5.2) applies to any investment asset that provides a known cash income.

If  $F_0 > (S_0 - I)e^{rT}$ , an arbitrageur can lock in a profit by buying the asset and shorting a forward contract on the asset; if  $F_0 < (S_0 - I)e^{rT}$ , an arbitrageur can lock in a profit by shorting the asset and taking a long position in a forward contract. If short sales are not possible, investors who own the asset will find it profitable to sell the asset and enter into long forward contracts.

# Example 5.2

Consider a 10-month forward contract on a stock when the stock price is  $50. We assume that the risk-free rate of interest (continuously compounded) is 8\%$  per annum for all maturities and also that dividends of 0.75 per share are expected after 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months. The present value of the dividends,  $I$ , is

$$

I = 0. 7 5 e ^ {- 0. 0 8 \times 3 / 1 2} + 0. 7 5 e ^ {- 0. 0 8 \times 6 / 1 2} + 0. 7 5 e ^ {- 0. 0 8 \times 9 / 1 2} = 2. 1 6 2

$$

The variable  $T$  is 10 months, so that the forward price,  $F_0$ , from equation (5.2), is given by


$$

F _ {0} = (5 0 - 2. 1 6 2) e ^ {0. 0 8 \times 1 0 / 1 2} = \$ 5 1. 1 4

$$

If the forward price were less than this, an arbitrageur would short the stock and buy forward contracts. If the forward price were greater than this, an arbitrageur would short forward contracts and buy the stock in the spot market.

# 5.6 KNOWNYIELD

We now consider the situation where the asset underlying a forward contract provides a known yield rather than a known cash income. This means that the income is known when expressed as a percentage of the asset's price at the time the income is paid. Suppose that an asset is expected to provide a yield of  $5\%$  per annum. This could mean that income is paid once a year and is equal to  $5\%$  of the asset price at the time it is paid, in which case the yield would be  $5\%$  with annual compounding. Alternatively, it could mean that income is paid twice a year and is equal to  $2.5\%$  of the asset price at the time it is paid, in which case the yield would be  $5\%$  per annum with semiannual compounding. In Section 4.4 we explained that we will normally measure interest rates with continuous compounding. Similarly, we will normally measure yields with continuous compounding. Formulas for translating a yield measured with one compounding frequency to a yield measured with another compounding frequency are the same as those given for interest rates in Section 4.4.

Define  $q$  as the average yield on the asset during time  $T$ . If the income is reinvested in the asset, the number of units held grows at rate  $q$ . One unit of the asset at time zero then grows to  $e^{qT}$  units of the asset at time  $T$ . The strategy
- Borrow  $S_{0}$  to buy one unit of the asset at time zero
- Enter into a forward contract to sell  $e^{qT}$  units of the asset at time  $T$  for  $F_0$
- Close out the forward contract by selling  $e^{qT}$  units of the asset at time  $T$ must therefore generate zero profit. Hence,


$$

S _ {0} e ^ {r T} = e ^ {q T} F _ {0}

$$ or


$$

F _ {0} = S _ {0} e ^ {(r - q) T} \tag {5.3}

$$

# Example 5.3

Consider a 6-month forward contract on an asset that is expected to provide income equal to  $2\%$  of the asset price once during a 6-month period. The risk-free rate of interest (with continuous compounding) is  $10\%$  per annum. The asset price is $25. In this case,  $S_0 = 25$ ,  $r = 0.10$ , and  $T = 0.5$ . The yield is  $4\%$  per annum with semiannual compounding. From equation (4.3), this is  $3.96\%$  per annum with continuous compounding. It follows that  $q = 0.0396$ , so that from equation (5.3) the forward price,  $F_0$ , is given by

$$

F _ {0} = 2 5 e ^ {(0. 1 0 - 0. 0 3 9 6) \times 0. 5} = \$ 2 5. 7 7

$$

# 5.7 VALUING FORWARD CONTRACTS

The value of a forward contract at the time it is first entered into is close to zero. At a later stage, it may prove to have a positive or negative value. It is important for banks and other financial institutions to value the contract each day. (This is referred to as marking to market the contract.) Using the notation introduced earlier, we suppose  $K$  is the delivery price for a contract that was negotiated some time ago, the delivery date is  $T$  years from today, and  $r$  is the  $T$ -year risk-free interest rate. The variable  $F_0$  is the forward price that would be applicable if we negotiated the contract today. In addition, we define  $f$  to be the value of forward contract today.

It is important to be clear about the meaning of the variables  $F_0, K$ , and  $f$ . At the beginning of the life of the forward contract, the delivery price,  $K$ , is set equal to the forward price at that time and the value of the contract,  $f$ , is 0. As time passes,  $K$  stays the same (because it is part of the definition of the contract), but the forward price changes and the value of the contract becomes either positive or negative.

A general result, applicable to all long forward contracts (both those on investment assets and those on consumption assets), is

$$ f = \left(F _ {0} - K\right) e ^ {- r T} \tag {5.4}
$$

To see why equation (5.4) is correct, we form a portfolio today consisting of (a) a forward contract to buy the underlying asset for  $K$  at time  $T$  and (b) a forward contract to sell the asset for  $F_0$  at time  $T$ . The payoff from the portfolio at time  $T$  is  $S_T - K$  from the first contract and  $F_0 - S_T$  from the second contract. The total payoff is  $F_0 - K$  and is known for certain today. The portfolio is therefore a risk-free investment and its value today is the payoff at time  $T$  discounted at the risk-free rate or  $(F_0 - K)e^{-rT}$ . The value of the forward contract to sell the asset for  $F_0$  is worth zero because  $F_0$  is the forward price that applies to a forward contract entered into today. It follows that the value of a (long) forward contract to buy an asset for  $K$  at time  $T$  must be  $(F_0 - K)e^{-rT}$ . Similarly, the value of a (short) forward contract to sell the asset for  $K$  at time  $T$  is  $(K - F_0)e^{-rT}$ .

# Example 5.4

A long forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock was entered into some time ago. It currently has 6 months to maturity. The risk-free rate of interest (with continuous compounding) is  $10\%$  per annum, the stock price is  $\$25$ , and the delivery price is  $\$24$ . In this case,  $S_0 = 25$ ,  $r = 0.10$ ,  $T = 0.5$ , and  $K = 24$ . From equation (5.1), the 6-month forward price,  $F_0$ , is given by

$$
F _ {0} = 2 5 e ^ {0. 1 \times 0. 5} = \$ 2 6. 2 8
$$

From equation (5.4), the value of the forward contract is

$$ f = (2 6. 2 8 - 2 4) e ^ {- 0. 1 \times 0. 5} = \$ 2. 1 7

$$

Equation (5.4) shows that we can value a long forward contract on an asset by making the assumption that the price of the asset at the maturity of the forward contract equals the forward price  $F_0$ . To see this, note that when we make that assumption, a long forward contract provides a payoff at time  $T$  of  $F_0 - K$ . This has a present value of  $(F_0 - K)e^{-rT}$ , which is the value of  $f$  in equation (5.4). Similarly, we can value a short forward contract on the asset by assuming that the current forward price of the asset is

# Business Snapshot 5.2 A Systems Error?

A foreign exchange trader working for a bank enters into a long forward contract to buy 1 million pounds sterling at an exchange rate of 1.5000 in 3 months. At the same time, another trader on the next desk takes a long position in 16 contracts for 3-month futures on sterling. The futures price is 1.5000 and each contract is on 62,500 pounds. The positions taken by the forward and futures traders are therefore the same. Within minutes of the positions being taken, the forward and the futures prices both increase to 1.5040. The bank's systems show that the futures trader has made a profit of  $4,000, while the forward trader has made a profit of only$ 3,900. The forward trader immediately calls the bank's systems department to complain. Does the forward trader have a valid complaint?

The answer is no! The daily settlement of futures contracts ensures that the futures trader realizes an almost immediate profit corresponding to the increase in the futures price. If the forward trader closed out the position by entering into a short contract at 1.5040, the forward trader would have contracted to buy 1 million pounds at 1.5000 in 3 months and sell 1 million pounds at 1.5040 in 3 months. This would lead to a  $4,000 profit—but in 3 months, not today. The forward trader's profit is the present value of$ 4,000. This is consistent with equation (5.4).

The forward trader can gain some consolation from the fact that gains and losses are treated symmetrically. If the forward/futures prices dropped to 1.4960 instead of rising to 1.5040, then the futures trader would take a loss of  $4,000 while the forward trader would take a loss of only$ 3,900.

realized. These results are analogous to the result in Section 4.9 that we can value a forward rate agreement on the assumption that forward rates are realized.

Using equation (5.4) in conjunction with equation (5.1) gives the following expression for the value of a forward contract on an investment asset that provides no income

$$ f = S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T} \tag {5.5}
$$

Similarly, using equation (5.4) in conjunction with equation (5.2) gives the following expression for the value of a long forward contract on an investment asset that provides a known income with present value  $I$ :

$$ f = S _ {0} - I - K e ^ {- r T} \tag {5.6}
$$

Finally, using equation (5.4) in conjunction with equation (5.3) gives the following expression for the value of a long forward contract on an investment asset that provides a known yield at rate  $q$ :

$$ f = S _ {0} e ^ {- q T} - K e ^ {- r T} \tag {5.7}
$$

When a futures price changes, the gain or loss on a futures contract is calculated as the change in the futures price multiplied by the size of the position. This gain is realized almost immediately because futures contracts are settled daily. Equation (5.4) shows that, when a forward price changes, the gain or loss is the present value of the change in the forward price multiplied by the size of the position. The difference between the gain/loss on forward and futures contracts can cause confusion on a foreign exchange trading desk (see Business Snapshot 5.2).

# 5.8 ARE FORWARD PRICES AND FUTURES PRICES EQUAL?

Technical Note 24 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes provides an arbitrage argument to show that, when the short-term risk-free interest rate is constant, the forward price for a contract with a certain delivery date is in theory the same as the futures price for a contract with that delivery date. The argument can be extended to cover situations where the interest rate is a known function of time.

When interest rates vary unpredictably (as they do in the real world), forward and futures prices are in theory no longer the same. We can get a sense of the nature of the relationship by considering the situation where the price of the underlying asset,  $S$ , is strongly positively correlated with interest rates. When  $S$  increases, an investor who holds a long futures position makes an immediate gain because of the daily settlement procedure. The positive correlation indicates that it is likely that interest rates have also increased, thereby increasing the rate at which the gain can be invested. Similarly, when  $S$  decreases, the investor will incur an immediate loss and it is likely that interest rates have just decreased, thereby reducing the rate at which the loss has to be financed. The positive correlation therefore works in the investor's favor. An investor holding a forward contract rather than a futures contract is not affected in this way by interest rate movements. It follows that a long futures contract will be slightly more attractive than a similar long forward contract. Hence, when  $S$  is strongly positively correlated with interest rates, futures prices will tend to be slightly higher than forward prices. When  $S$  is strongly negatively correlated with interest rates, a similar argument shows that forward prices will tend to be slightly higher than futures prices.

The theoretical differences between forward and futures prices for contracts that last only a few months are in most circumstances sufficiently small to be ignored. In practice, there are a number of factors not reflected in theoretical models that may cause forward and futures prices to be different. These include taxes, transactions costs, and margin requirements. The risk that the counterparty will default may be less in the case of a futures contract because of the role of the exchange clearing house. Also, in some instances, futures contracts are more liquid and easier to trade than forward contracts. Despite all these points, for most purposes it is reasonable to assume that forward and futures prices are the same. This is the assumption we will usually make in this book. We will use the symbol  $F_{0}$  to represent both the futures price and the forward price of an asset today.

One exception to the rule that futures and forward contracts can be assumed to be the same concerns interest rate futures. This will be discussed in Section 6.3.

# 5.9 FUTURES PRICES OF STOCK INDICES

We introduced futures on stock indices in Section 3.5 and showed how a stock index futures contract is a useful tool in managing equity portfolios. Table 3.3 shows futures prices for a number of different indices. We are now in a position to consider how index futures prices are determined.

A stock index can usually be regarded as the price of an investment asset that pays dividends. The investment asset is the portfolio of stocks underlying the index, and the

# Business Snapshot 5.3 The CME Nikkei 225 Futures Contract

The arguments in this chapter on how index futures prices are determined require that the index be the value of an investment asset. This means that it must be the value of a portfolio of assets that can be traded. The asset underlying the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's futures contract on the Nikkei 225 Index does not qualify, and the reason why is quite subtle. Suppose  $S$  is the value of the Nikkei 225 Index. This is the value of a portfolio of 225 Japanese stocks measured in yen. The variable underlying the CME futures contract on the Nikkei 225 has a dollar value of 5S. In other words, the futures contract takes a variable that is measured in yen and treats it as though it is dollars.

We cannot invest in a portfolio whose value will always be 5S dollars. The best we can do is to invest in one that is always worth 5S yen or in one that is always worth 5QS dollars, where  $Q$  is the dollar value of 1 yen. The variable 5S dollars is not, therefore, the price of an investment asset and equation (5.8) does not apply.

CME's Nikkei 225 futures contract is an example of a quanto. A quanto is a derivative where the underlying asset is measured in one currency and the payoff is in another currency. Quantos will be discussed further in Chapter 30.

dividends paid by the investment asset are the dividends that would be received by the holder of this portfolio. It is usually assumed that the dividends provide a known yield rather than a known cash income. If  $q$  is the dividend yield rate (expressed with continuous compounding), equation (5.3) gives the futures price,  $F_{0}$ , as

$$
F _ {0} = S _ {0} e ^ {(r - q) T} \tag {5.8}
$$

This shows that the futures price increases at rate  $r - q$  with the maturity of the futures contract. In Table 3.3, the S&P 500 settlements are declining at roughly  $0.5\%$  per six months, or  $1\%$  per year. This indicates that the dividend yield anticipated by the market on the S&P 500 during the first year was about  $1\%$  per annum greater than the risk-free rate.

# Example 5.5

Consider a 3-month futures contract on an index. Suppose that the stocks underlying the index provide a dividend yield of  $1\%$  per annum (continuously compounded), that the current value of the index is 1,300, and that the continuously compounded risk-free interest rate is  $5\%$  per annum. In this case,  $r = 0.05$ ,  $S_0 = 1,300$ ,  $T = 0.25$ , and  $q = 0.01$ . Hence, the futures price,  $F_0$ , is given by

$$
F _ {0} = 1, 3 0 0 e ^ {(0. 0 5 - 0. 0 1) \times 0. 2 5} = \$ 1, 3 1 3. 0 7
$$

In practice, the dividend yield on the portfolio underlying an index varies week by week throughout the year. For example, a large proportion of the dividends on the NYSE stocks are paid in the first week of February, May, August, and November each year. The chosen value of  $q$  should represent the average annualized dividend yield during the life of the contract. The dividends used for estimating  $q$  should be those for which the ex-dividend date is during the life of the futures contract.

# Business Snapshot 5.4 Index Arbitrage in October 1987

To do index arbitrage, a trader must be able to trade both the index futures contract and the portfolio of stocks underlying the index very quickly at the prices quoted in the market. In normal market conditions this is possible using program trading, and the relationship in equation (5.8) holds well. Examples of days when the market was anything but normal are October 19 and 20 of 1987. On what is termed "Black Monday," October 19, 1987, the market fell by more than  $20\%$ , and the 604 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange easily exceeded all previous records. The exchange's systems were overloaded, and orders placed to buy or sell shares on that day could be delayed by up to two hours before being executed.

For most of October 19, 1987, futures prices were at a significant discount to the underlying index. For example, at the close of trading the S&P 500 Index was at 225.06 (down 57.88 on the day), whereas the futures price for December delivery on the S&P 500 was 201.50 (down 80.75 on the day). This was largely because the delays in processing orders made index arbitrage impossible. On the next day, Tuesday, October 20, 1987, the New York Stock Exchange placed temporary restrictions on the way in which program trading could be done. This also made index arbitrage very difficult and the breakdown of the traditional linkage between stock indices and stock index futures continued. At one point the futures price for the December contract was  $18\%$  less than the S&P 500 Index. However, after a few days the market returned to normal, and the activities of arbitrageurs ensured that equation (5.8) governed the relationship between futures and spot prices of indices.

# Index Arbitrage

If  $F_0 > S_0 e^{(r - q)T}$ , profits can be made by buying the stocks underlying the index at the spot price (i.e., for immediate delivery) and shorting futures contracts. If  $F_0 < S_0 e^{(r - q)T}$ , profits can be made by doing the reverse—that is, shorting or selling the stocks underlying the index and taking a long position in futures contracts. These strategies are known as index arbitrage. When  $F_0 < S_0 e^{(r - q)T}$ , index arbitrage is often done by a pension fund that owns an indexed portfolio of stocks. When  $F_0 > S_0 e^{(r - q)T}$ , it might be done by a bank or a corporation holding short-term money market investments. For indices involving many stocks, index arbitrage is sometimes accomplished by trading a relatively small representative sample of stocks whose movements closely mirror those of the index. Usually index arbitrage is implemented through program trading. This involves using a computer system to generate the trades.

Most of the time the activities of arbitrageurs ensure that equation (5.8) holds, but occasionally arbitrage is impossible and the futures price does get out of line with the spot price (see Business Snapshot 5.4).

# 5.10 FORWARD AND FUTURES CONTRACTS ON CURRENCYCS

We now move on to consider forward and futures foreign currency contracts. For the sake of definiteness we will assume that the domestic currency is the U.S. dollar (i.e., we take the perspective of a U.S. investor). The underlying asset is one unit of the foreign currency. We will therefore define the variable  $S_{0}$  as the current spot price in U.S. dollars of one unit of the foreign currency and  $F_{0}$  as the forward or futures price in U.S. dollars of one unit of the foreign currency. This is consistent with the way we have defined  $S_{0}$  and  $F_{0}$  for other assets underlying forward and futures contracts. However, as mentioned in Section 2.11, it does not necessarily correspond to the way spot and forward exchange rates are quoted. For major exchange rates other than the British pound, euro, Australian dollar, and New Zealand dollar, a spot or forward exchange rate is normally quoted as the number of units of the currency that are equivalent to one U.S. dollar.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/1c26ae8033e53a64dd136d9afcb2706542a427e8aa901cad7ba42fc4befd97e5.jpg)

Figure 5.1 Two ways of converting 1,000 units of a foreign currency to dollars at time  $T$ . Here,  $S_{0}$  is spot exchange rate,  $F_{0}$  is forward exchange rate, and  $r$  and  $r_{f}$  are the dollar and foreign risk-free rates.

A foreign currency has the property that the holder of the currency can earn interest at the risk-free interest rate prevailing in the foreign country. For example, the holder can invest the currency in a foreign-denominated bond. We define  $r_f$  as the value of the foreign risk-free interest rate when money is invested for time  $T$ . The variable  $r$  is the domestic risk-free rate when money is invested for this period of time.

The relationship between  $F_{0}$  and  $S_{0}$  is

$$
F _ {0} = S _ {0} e ^ {(r - r _ {f}) T} \tag {5.9}
$$

This is the well-known interest rate parity relationship from international finance. The reason it is true is illustrated in Figure 5.1. Suppose that an individual starts with 1,000 units of the foreign currency. There are two ways it can be converted to dollars at time  $T$ . One is by investing it for  $T$  years at  $r_f$  and entering into a forward contract to sell the proceeds for dollars at time  $T$ . This generates  $1,000e^{r_fT}F_0$  dollars. The other is by exchanging the foreign currency for dollars in the spot market and investing the proceeds for  $T$  years at rate  $r$ . This generates  $1,000S_0e^{rT}$  dollars. In the absence of arbitrage opportunities, the two strategies must give the same result. Hence,

$$
1, 0 0 0 e ^ {r _ {f} T} F _ {0} = 1, 0 0 0 S _ {0} e ^ {r T}
$$ so that


$$

F _ {0} = S _ {0} e ^ {(r - r _ {f}) T}

$$

# Example 5.6

Suppose that the 2-year interest rates in Australia and the United States are  $3\%$  and  $1\%$ , respectively, and the spot exchange rate is 0.7500 USD per AUD. From equation (5.9), the 2-year forward exchange rate should be

$$
0. 7 5 0 0 e ^ {(0. 0 1 - 0. 0 3) \times 2} = 0. 7 2 0 6
$$

Suppose first that the 2-year forward exchange rate is less than this, say 0.7000. An arbitrageur can:

1. Borrow 1,000 AUD at  $3\%$  per annum for 2 years, convert to 750 USD and invest the USD at  $1\%$  (both rates are continuously compounded).
2. Enter into a forward contract to buy 1,061.84 AUD for 1,061.84 × 0.7000 = 743.29 USD in 2 years.

The 750 USD that are invested at  $1\%$  grow to  $750e^{0.01 \times 2} = 765.15$  USD in 2 years. Of this, 743.29 USD are used to purchase 1,061.84 AUD under the terms of the forward contract. This is exactly enough to repay principal and interest on the 1,000 AUD that are borrowed ( $1,000e^{0.03 \times 2} = 1,061.84$ ). The strategy therefore gives rise to a riskless profit of  $765.15 - 743.29 = 21.87$  USD. (If this does not sound very exciting, consider following a similar strategy where you borrow 100 million AUD!)

Suppose next that the 2-year forward rate is 0.7600 (greater than the 0.7206 value given by equation (5.9)). An arbitrageur can:

1. Borrow 1,000 USD at  $1\%$  per annum for 2 years, convert to 1,000/0.7500 = 1,333.33 AUD, and invest the AUD at  $3\%$ .
2. Enter into a forward contract to sell 1,415.79 AUD for  $1,415.79 \times 0.76 = 1,075.99$  USD in 2 years.

The 1,333.33 AUD that are invested at  $3\%$  grow to  $1,333.33e^{0.03 \times 2} = 1,415.79$  AUD in 2 years. The forward contract has the effect of converting this to 1,075.99 USD. The amount needed to payoff the USD borrowings is  $1,000e^{0.01 \times 2} = 1,020.20$  USD. The strategy therefore gives rise to a riskless profit of  $1,075.99 - 1,020.20 = 55.79$  USD.

Table 5.4 shows currency futures quotes on May 21, 2020. The quotes are U.S. dollars per unit of the foreign currency. (In the case of the Japanese yen, the quote is U.S. dollars per 100 yen.) This is the usual quotation convention for futures contracts. Equation (5.9) applies with  $r$  equal to the U.S. risk-free rate and  $r_f$  equal to the foreign risk-free rate. The size of one contract is indicated at the top of each segment of the table.

For all the currencies considered in the table, short-term interest rates were lower than on the U.S. dollar. This corresponds to the  $r > r_f$  situation and explains why the settlement futures prices of these currencies increase with maturity. The CME launched futures on the cryptocurrency bitcoin in December 2017. The table shows

# Example 5.7

In Table 5.4, the September settlement price for the euro is about  $0.2\%$  higher than the June settlement price, and the December settlement price is about  $0.2\%$  higher than the September settlement price. This indicates that the futures prices are increasing at about  $4 \times 0.2 = 0.8\%$  per year with maturity. From equation (5.9) this is a rough estimate of the amount by which short-term euro interest rates were less than short-term U.S. interest rates in May 2020.

# A Foreign Currency as an Asset Providing a Known Yield

Equation (5.9) is identical to equation (5.3) with  $q$  replaced by  $r_f$ . This is not a coincidence. A foreign currency can be regarded as an investment asset paying a known yield. The yield is the risk-free rate of interest in the foreign currency.

To understand this, we note that the value of interest paid in a foreign currency depends on the value of the foreign currency. Suppose that the interest rate on British pounds is  $5\%$  per annum. To a U.S. investor the British pound provides an income equal to  $5\%$  of the value of the British pound per annum. In other words it is an asset that provides a yield of  $5\%$  per annum.

# 5.11 FUTURES ON COMMODITIES

We now move on to consider futures contracts on commodities. First we look at the futures prices of commodities that are investment assets such as gold and silver. We then go on to examine the futures prices of consumption assets.

# Income and Storage Costs

As explained in Business Snapshot 3.1, the hedging strategies of gold producers leads to a requirement on the part of investment banks to borrow gold. Gold owners such as central banks charge interest in the form of what is known as the gold lease rate when they lend gold. The same is true of silver. Gold and silver can therefore provide income to the holder. Like other commodities they also have storage costs.

Equation (5.1) shows that, in the absence of storage costs and income, the forward price of a commodity that is an investment asset is given by

$$

F _ {0} = S _ {0} e ^ {r T} \tag {5.10}

$$

Storage costs can be treated as negative income. If  $U$  is the present value of all the storage costs, net of income, during the life of a forward contract, it follows from equation (5.2) that

$$

F _ {0} = \left(S _ {0} + U\right) e ^ {r T} \tag {5.11}

$$

# Example 5.8

Consider a 1-year futures contract on an investment asset that provides no income. It costs  $2 per unit to store the asset, with the payment being made at the end of the year. Assume that the spot price is$ 450 per unit and the risk-free rate is 7\% per annum for all maturities. This corresponds to  $r = 0.07$ ,  $S_0 = 450$ ,  $T = 1$ , and

$$

U = 2 e ^ {- 0. 0 7 \times 1} = 1. 8 6 5

$$

From equation (5.11), the theoretical futures price,  $F_{0}$ , is given by

$$

F _ {0} = (4 5 0 + 1. 8 6 5) e ^ {0. 0 7 \times 1} = \$ 4 8 4. 6 3

$$

If the actual futures price is greater than 484.63, an arbitrageur can buy the asset and short 1-year futures contracts to lock in a profit. If the actual futures price is less than 484.63, an investor who already owns the asset can improve the return by selling the asset and buying futures contracts.

If the storage costs (net of income) incurred at any time are proportional to the price of the commodity, they can be treated as negative yield. In this case, from equation (5.3),

$$

F _ {0} = S _ {0} e ^ {(r + u) T} \tag {5.12}

$$ where  $u$  denotes the storage costs per annum as a proportion of the spot price net of any yield earned on the asset.

# Consumption Commodities

Commodities that are consumption assets rather than investment assets usually provide no income, but can be subject to significant storage costs. We now review the arbitrage strategies used to determine futures prices from spot prices carefully. Suppose that, instead of equation (5.11), we have

$$
F _ {0} > \left(S _ {0} + U\right) e ^ {r T} \tag {5.13}
$$

To take advantage of this opportunity, an arbitrageur can implement the following strategy:

1. Borrow an amount  $S_0 + U$  at the risk-free rate and use it to purchase one unit of the commodity and to pay storage costs.
2. Short a futures contract on one unit of the commodity.

If we regard the futures contract as a forward contract, so that there is no daily settlement, this strategy leads to a profit of  $F_0 - (S_0 + U)e^{rT}$  at time  $T$ . There is no problem in implementing the strategy for any commodity. However, as arbitrageurs do so, there will be a tendency for  $S_0$  to increase and  $F_0$  to decrease until equation (5.13) is no longer true. We conclude that equation (5.13) cannot hold for any significant length of time.

Suppose next that

$$
F _ {0} <   \left(S _ {0} + U\right) e ^ {r T} \tag {5.14}
$$

When the commodity is an investment asset, we can argue that many investors hold the commodity solely for investment. When they observe the inequality in equation (5.14), they will find it profitable to do the following:

1. Sell the commodity, save the storage costs, and invest the proceeds at the risk-free interest rate.
2. Take a long position in a futures contract.

The result is a riskless profit at maturity of  $(S_0 + U)e^{rT} - F_0$  relative to the position the investors would have been in if they had held the commodity. It follows that equation (5.14) cannot hold for long. Because neither equation (5.13) nor (5.14) can hold for long, we must have  $F_0 = (S_0 + U)e^{rT}$ .

This argument cannot be used for a commodity that is a consumption asset rather than an investment asset. Individuals and companies who own a consumption commodity usually plan to use it in some way. They are reluctant to sell the commodity in the spot market and buy forward or futures contracts, because forward and futures contracts cannot be used in a manufacturing process or consumed in some other way. There is therefore nothing to stop equation (5.14) from holding, and all we can assert for a consumption commodity is

$$
F _ {0} \leq \left(S _ {0} + U\right) e ^ {r T} \tag {5.15}
$$

If storage costs are expressed as a proportion  $u$  of the spot price, the equivalent result is

$$
F _ {0} \leq S _ {0} e ^ {(r + u) T} \tag {5.16}
$$

# Convenience Yields

We do not necessarily have equality in equations (5.15) and (5.16) because users of a consumption commodity may feel that ownership of the physical commodity provides benefits that are not obtained by holders of futures contracts. For example, an oil refiner is unlikely to regard a futures contract on crude oil in the same way as crude oil held in inventory. The crude oil in inventory can be an input to the refining process, whereas a futures contract cannot be used for this purpose. In general, ownership of the physical asset enables a manufacturer to keep a production process running and perhaps profit from temporary local shortages. A futures contract does not do the same. The benefits from holding the physical asset are sometimes referred to as the convenience yield provided by the commodity. If the dollar amount of storage costs is known and has a present value  $U$ , then the convenience yield  $y$  is defined such that

$$
F _ {0} e ^ {y T} = (S _ {0} + U) e ^ {r T}
$$

If the storage costs per unit are a constant proportion,  $u$ , of the spot price, then  $y$  is defined so that

$$
F _ {0} e ^ {y T} = S _ {0} e ^ {(r + u) T}
$$ or


$$

F _ {0} = S _ {0} e ^ {(r + u - y) T} \tag {5.17}

$$

The convenience yield simply measures the extent to which the left-hand side is less than the right-hand side in equation (5.15) or (5.16). For investment assets the convenience yield must be zero; otherwise, there are arbitrage opportunities. Table 2.2 in Chapter 2 shows that, on May 21, 2020, the futures price of soybeans decreased as the maturity of the contract increased from January 2021 to May 2021. This pattern suggests that the convenience yield,  $y$ , is greater than  $r + u$  during this period.

The convenience yield reflects the market's expectations concerning the future availability of the commodity. The greater the possibility that shortages will occur, the higher the convenience yield. If users of the commodity have high inventories, there is very little chance of shortages in the near future and the convenience yield tends to be low. If inventories are low, shortages are more likely and the convenience yield is usually higher.

# 5.12 THE COST OF CARRY

The relationship between futures prices and spot prices can be summarized in terms of the cost of carry. This measures the storage cost plus the interest that is paid to finance the asset less the income earned on the asset. For a non-dividend-paying stock, the cost of carry is  $r$ , because there are no storage costs and no income is earned; for a stock index, it is  $r - q$ , because income is earned at rate  $q$  on the asset. For a currency, it is  $r - r_f$ ; for a commodity that provides income at rate  $q$  and requires storage costs at rate  $u$ , it is  $r - q + u$ ; and so on.


Define the cost of carry as  $c$ . For an investment asset, the futures price is

$$

F _ {0} = S _ {0} e ^ {c T} \tag {5.18}

$$

For a consumption asset, it is

$$

F _ {0} = S _ {0} e ^ {(c - y) T} \tag {5.19}

$$ where  $y$  is the convenience yield.

# 5.13 DELIVERY OPTIONS

Whereas a forward contract normally specifies that delivery is to take place on a particular day, a futures contract often allows the party with the short position to choose to deliver at any time during a certain period. (Typically the party has to give a few days' notice of its intention to deliver.) The choice introduces a complication into the determination of futures prices. Should the maturity of the futures contract be assumed to be the beginning, middle, or end of the delivery period? Even though most futures contracts are closed out prior to maturity, it is important to know when delivery would have taken place in order to calculate the theoretical futures price.

If the futures price is an increasing function of the time to maturity, it can be seen from equation (5.19) that  $c > y$ , so that the benefits from holding the asset (including convenience yield and net of storage costs) are less than the risk-free rate. It is usually optimal in such a case for the party with the short position to deliver as early as possible, because the interest earned on the cash received outweighs the benefits of holding the asset. As a rule, futures prices in these circumstances should be calculated on the basis that delivery will take place at the beginning of the delivery period. If futures prices are decreasing as time to maturity increases ( $c < y$ ), the reverse is true. It is then usually optimal for the party with the short position to deliver as late as possible, and futures prices should, as a rule, be calculated on this assumption.

# 5.14 FUTURES PRICES AND EXPECTED FUTURE SPOT PRICES

We refer to the market's average opinion about what the spot price of an asset will be at a certain future time as the expected spot price of the asset at that time. Suppose that it is now June and the September futures price of corn is 450 cents. It is interesting to ask what the expected spot price of corn in September is. Is it less than 450 cents, greater than 450 cents, or exactly equal to 450 cents? As illustrated in Figure 2.1, the futures price converges to the spot price at maturity. If the expected spot price is less than 450 cents, the market must be expecting the September futures price to decline, so that traders with short positions gain and traders with long positions lose. If the expected spot price is greater than 450 cents, the reverse must be true. The market must be expecting the September futures price to increase, so that traders with long positions gain while those with short positions lose.

# Keynes and Hicks

Economists John Maynard Keynes and John Hicks argued that, if hedgers tend to hold short positions and speculators tend to hold long positions, the futures price of an asset will be below the expected spot price.[8] This is because speculators require compensation for the risks they are bearing. They will trade only if they can expect to make money on average. Hedgers will lose money on average, but they are likely to be prepared to accept this because the futures contract reduces their risks. If hedgers tend to hold long positions while speculators hold short positions, Keynes and Hicks argued that the futures price will be above the expected spot price for a similar reason.

# Risk and Return

The modern approach to explaining the relationship between futures prices and expected spot prices is based on the relationship between risk and expected return in the economy. In general, the higher the risk of an investment, the higher the expected return demanded by an investor. The capital asset pricing model, which is explained in the appendix to Chapter 3, shows that there are two types of risk in the economy: systematic and nonsystematic. Nonsystematic risk should not be important to an investor. It can be almost completely eliminated by holding a well-diversified portfolio. An investor should not therefore require a higher expected return for bearing nonsystematic risk. Systematic risk, in contrast, cannot be diversified away. It arises from a correlation between returns from the investment and returns from the whole stock market. An investor generally requires a higher expected return than the risk-free interest rate for bearing positive amounts of systematic risk. Also, an investor is prepared to accept a lower expected return than the risk-free interest rate when the systematic risk in an investment is negative.

# The Risk in a Futures Position

Let us consider a speculator who takes a long position in a futures contract that lasts for  $T$  years in the hope that the spot price of the asset will be above the futures price at the end of the life of the futures contract. We ignore daily settlement and assume that the futures contract can be treated as a forward contract. We suppose that the speculator puts the present value of the futures price into a risk-free investment while simultaneously taking a long futures position. The proceeds of the risk-free investment are used to buy the asset on the delivery date. The asset is then immediately sold for its market price. The cash flows to the speculator are as follows:

Today:  $-F_{0}e^{-rT}$

End of futures contract:  $+S_{T}$ where  $F_{0}$  is the futures price today,  $S_{T}$  is the price of the asset at time  $T$  at the end of the futures contract, and  $r$  is the risk-free return on funds invested for time  $T$ .

How do we value this investment? The discount rate we should use for the expected cash flow at time  $T$  equals an investor's required return on the investment. Suppose that  $k$  is an investor's required return for this investment. The present value of this investment is

$$
- F _ {0} e ^ {- r T} + E (S _ {T}) e ^ {- k T}
$$ where  $E$  denotes expected value. We can assume that all investments in securities markets are priced so that they have zero net present value. This means that


$$
- F _ {0} e ^ {- r T} + E (S _ {T}) e ^ {- k T} = 0
$$ or


$$

F _ {0} = E \left(S _ {T}\right) e ^ {(r - k) T} \tag {5.20}

$$

As we have just discussed, the returns investors require on an investment depend on its systematic risk. The investment we have been considering is in essence an investment in the asset underlying the futures contract. If the returns from this asset are uncorrelated with the stock market, the correct discount rate to use is the risk-free rate  $r$ , so we should set  $k = r$ . Equation (5.20) then gives

$$

F _ {0} = E (S _ {T})

$$

This shows that the futures price is an unbiased estimate of the expected future spot price when the return from the underlying asset is uncorrelated with the stock market.

If the return from the asset is positively correlated with the stock market,  $k > r$  and equation (5.20) leads to  $F_0 < E(S_T)$ . This shows that, when the asset underlying the futures contract has positive systematic risk, we should expect the futures price to understate the expected future spot price. An example of an asset that has positive systematic risk is a stock index. The expected return of investors on the stocks underlying an index is generally more than the risk-free rate,  $r$ . The dividends provide a return of  $q$ . The expected increase in the index must therefore be more than  $r - q$ . Equation (5.8) is therefore consistent with the prediction that the futures price understates the expected future stock price for a stock index.

If the return from the asset is negatively correlated with the stock market,  $k < r$  and equation (5.20) gives  $F_0 > E(S_T)$ . This shows that, when the asset underlying the futures contract has negative systematic risk, we should expect the futures price to overstate the expected future spot price.

These results are summarized in Table 5.5.

Table 5.5 Relationship between futures price and expected future spot price.

<table><tr><td>Underlying asset</td><td>Relationship of expected return k from asset to risk-free rate r</td><td>Relationship of futures price F to expected future spot price E(ST)</td></tr><tr><td>No systematic risk</td><td>k = r</td><td>F0 = E(ST)</td></tr><tr><td>Positive systematic risk</td><td>k &gt; r</td><td>F0 &lt; E(ST)</td></tr><tr><td>Negative systematic risk</td><td>k &lt; r</td><td>F0 &gt; E(ST)</td></tr></table>

# Normal Backwardation and Contango

When the futures price is below the expected future spot price, the situation is known as normal backwardation; and when the futures price is above the expected future spot price, the situation is known as contango. However, it should be noted that sometimes these terms are used to refer to whether the futures price is below or above the current spot price, rather than the expected future spot price.

# SUMMARY

For most purposes, the futures price of a contract with a certain delivery date can be considered to be the same as the forward price for a contract with the same delivery date. It can be shown that in theory the two should be exactly the same when interest rates are perfectly predictable.

For the purposes of understanding futures (or forward) prices, it is convenient to divide futures contracts into two categories: those in which the underlying asset is held for investment by at least some traders and those in which the underlying asset is held primarily for consumption purposes.

In the case of investment assets, we have considered three different situations:

1. The asset provides no income.
2. The asset provides a known dollar income.
3. The asset provides a known yield.

The results are summarized in Table 5.6. They enable futures prices to be obtained for contracts on stock indices, currencies, gold, and silver. Storage costs can be treated as negative income.

In the case of consumption assets, it is not possible to obtain the futures price as a function of the spot price and other observable variables. Here the parameter known as the asset's convenience yield becomes important. It measures the extent to which users of the commodity feel that ownership of the physical asset provides benefits that are not obtained by the holders of the futures contract. These benefits may include the ability to profit from temporary local shortages or the ability to keep a production process running. We can obtain an upper bound for the futures price of consumption assets using arbitrage arguments, but we cannot nail down an equality relationship between futures and spot prices.

Table 5.6 Summary of results for a contract with time to maturity  $T$  on an investment asset with price  $S_0$  when the risk-free interest rate for a  $T$ -year period is  $r$ .

<table><tr><td>Asset</td><td>Forward/futures price</td><td>Value of long forward contract with delivery price K</td></tr><tr><td>Provides no income:</td><td>S0erT</td><td>S0 - Ke-rT</td></tr><tr><td>Provides known income with present value I:</td><td>(S0 - I)e rT</td><td>S0 - I - Ke-rT</td></tr><tr><td>Provides known yield q:</td><td>S0e(r-q)T</td><td>S0e-qT - Ke-rT</td></tr></table>

The concept of cost of carry is sometimes useful. The cost of carry is the storage cost of the underlying asset plus the cost of financing it minus the income received from it. In the case of investment assets, the futures price is greater than the spot price by an amount reflecting the cost of carry. In the case of consumption assets, the futures price is greater than the spot price by an amount reflecting the cost of carry net of the convenience yield.

If we assume the capital asset pricing model is true, the relationship between the futures price and the expected future spot price depends on whether the return on the asset is positively or negatively correlated with the return on the stock market. Positive correlation will tend to lead to a futures price lower than the expected future spot price, whereas negative correlation will tend to lead to a futures price higher than the expected future spot price. Only when the correlation is zero will the theoretical futures price be equal to the expected future spot price.

5.19. Assume that the risk-free interest rate is  $4\%$  per annum with continuous compounding and that the dividend yield on a stock index varies throughout the year. In February, May, August, and November, dividends are paid at a rate of  $5\%$  per annum. In other months, dividends are paid at a rate of  $2\%$  per annum. Suppose that the value of the index on July 31 is 1,300. What is the futures price for a contract deliverable in December 31 of the same year?
5.20. Suppose that the risk-free interest rate is  $6\%$  per annum with continuous compounding and that the dividend yield on a stock index is  $4\%$  per annum.

Prior to March 9, 1988, the change in the index from one day to the next was calculated as the geometric average of the changes in the prices of the stocks underlying the index. In these circumstances, does equation (5.8) correctly relate the futures price of the index to its cash price? If not, does the equation overstate or understate the futures price?

5.30. A U.S. company is interested in using the futures contracts traded by the CME Group to hedge its Australian dollar exposure.

Assume that  $r$  and  $r_f$  are constant and that the company uses a contract expiring at time  $T$  to hedge an exposure at time  $t$  ( $T > t$ ).

(b) Show that, when  $t$  is 1 day, the optimal hedge ratio is almost exactly  $S_0 / F_0$ , where  $S_0$  is the current spot price of the currency and  $F_0$  is the current futures price of the currency for the contract maturing at time  $T$ .

5.33. An index is 1,200. The three-month risk-free rate is  $3\%$  per annum and the dividend yield over the next three months is  $1.2\%$  per annum. The six-month risk-free rate is  $3.5\%$  per annum and the dividend yield over the next six months is  $1\%$  per annum.

How would you price the product that the company wants?
5.37. A company enters into a forward contract with a bank to sell a foreign currency for  $K_{1}$  at time  $T_{1}$ . The exchange rate at time  $T_{1}$  proves to be  $S_{1} (> K_{1})$ .

# Interest Rate Futures

So far we have covered futures contracts on commodities, stock indices, and foreign currencies. We have seen how they work, how they are used for hedging, and how futures prices are determined. We now move on to consider interest rate futures.

This chapter explains the contracts that trade in the United States. Many of the other interest rate futures contracts throughout the world have been modeled on these contracts. The chapter also shows how interest rate futures contracts, when used in conjunction with the duration measure introduced in Chapter 4, can be used to hedge a company's exposure to interest rate movements.

# 6.1 DAY COUNT AND QUotation CONVENTIONS

As a preliminary to the material in this chapter, we consider the day count and quotation conventions that apply to bonds and other instruments dependent on interest rates.

# Day Counts

The day count defines the way in which interest accrues over time. Generally, we know the interest earned over some reference period (e.g., the time between coupon payments on a bond), and we are interested in calculating the interest earned over some other period.

The day count convention is usually expressed as  $X / Y$ . When we are calculating the interest earned between two dates,  $X$  defines the way in which the number of days between the two dates is calculated, and  $Y$  defines the way in which the total number of days in the reference period is measured. The interest earned between the two dates is

Number of days between dates  $\times$  Interest earned in reference period

Three day count conventions that are commonly used in the United States are:

1. Actual/actual (in period)
2. 30/360
3. Actual/360

# Business Snapshot 6.1 Day Counts Can Be Deceptive

Between February 28, 2018, and March 1, 2018, you have a choice between owning a U.S. government bond and a U.S. corporate bond. They pay the same coupon and have the same quoted price. Assuming no risk of default, which would you prefer?

It sounds as though you should be indifferent, but in fact you should have a marked preference for the corporate bond. Under the 30/360 day count convention used for corporate bonds, there are 3 days between February 28, 2018, and March 1, 2018. Under the actual/actual (in period) day count convention used for government bonds, there is only 1 day. You would earn approximately three times as much interest by holding the corporate bond!

The actual/actual (in period) day count is used for Treasury bonds in the United States. This means that the interest earned between two dates is based on the ratio of the actual days elapsed to the actual number of days in the period between coupon payments. Assume that the bond principal is 100, coupon payment dates are March 1 and September 1, and the coupon rate is 8\% per annum. (This means that 4 of interest is paid on each of March 1 and September 1.) Suppose that we wish to calculate the interest earned between March 1 and July 3. The reference period is from March 1 to September 1. There are 184 (actual) days in the reference period, and interest of 4 is earned during the period. There are 124 (actual) days between March 1 and July 3. The interest earned between March 1 and July 3 is therefore

$$

\frac {1 2 4}{1 8 4} \times 4 = 2. 6 9 5 7

$$

The 30/360 day count is used for corporate and municipal bonds in the United States. This means that we assume 30 days per month and 360 days per year when carrying out calculations. With the 30/360 day count, the total number of days between March 1 and September 1 is 180. The total number of days between March 1 and July 3 is  $(4 \times 30) + 2 = 122$ . In a corporate bond with the same terms as the Treasury bond just considered, the interest earned between March 1 and July 3 would therefore be

$$

\frac {1 2 2}{1 8 0} \times 4 = 2. 7 1 1 1

$$

As shown in Business Snapshot 6.1, sometimes the 30/360 day count convention has surprising consequences.

The actual/360 day count is used for money market instruments in the United States. This indicates that the reference period is 360 days. The interest earned during part of a year is calculated by dividing the actual number of elapsed days by 360 and multiplying by the rate. The interest earned in 90 days is therefore exactly one-fourth of the quoted rate, and the interest earned in a whole year of 365 days is 365/360 times the quoted rate.

Conventions vary from country to country and from instrument to instrument. For example, money market instruments are quoted on an actual/365 basis in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. LIBOR is quoted on an actual/360 for all currencies except sterling, for which it is quoted on an actual/365 basis. Euro-denominated and sterling bonds are usually quoted on an actual/actual basis.

# Price Quotations of U.S. Treasury Bills

The prices of money market instruments are sometimes quoted using a discount rate. This is the interest earned as a percentage of the final face value rather than as a percentage of the initial price paid for the instrument. An example is Treasury bills in the United States. If the price of a 91-day Treasury bill is quoted as 8, this means that the rate of interest earned is  $8\%$  of the face value per 360 days. Suppose that the face value is \ $100. Interest of \$ 2.0222 (= \ $100 × 0.08 × 91/360) is earned over the 91-day life. This corresponds to a true rate of interest of 2.0222/(100 - 2.0222) = 2.064\% for the 91-day period. In general, the relationship between the cash price per \$ 100 of face value and the quoted price of a Treasury bill in the United States is

$$

P = \frac {3 6 0}{n} (1 0 0 - Y)

$$ where  $P$  is the quoted price,  $Y$  is the cash price, and  $n$  is the remaining life of the Treasury bill measured in calendar days. For example, when the cash price of a 90-day Treasury bill is 99, the quoted price is 4.

# Price Quotations of U.S. Treasury Bonds

Treasury bond prices in the United States are quoted in dollars and thirty-seconds of a dollar. The quoted price is for a bond with a face value of $100. Thus, a quote of 120-05 or  $120\frac{5}{32}$  indicates that the quoted price for a bond with a face value of $100,000 is 120,156.25.

The quoted price, which traders refer to as the clean price, is not the same as the cash price paid by the purchaser of the bond, which is referred to by traders as the dirty price. In general,

Cash price = Quoted price + Accrued interest since last coupon date

To illustrate this formula, suppose that it is March 5, 2018, and the bond under consideration is an  $11\%$  coupon bond maturing on July 10, 2038, with a quoted price of 155-16 or $155.50. Because coupons are paid semiannually on government bonds (and the final coupon is at maturity), the most recent coupon date is January 10, 2018, and the next coupon date is July 10, 2018. The (actual) number of days between January 10, 2018, and March 5, 2018, is 54, whereas the (actual) number of days between January 10, 2018, and July 10, 2018, is 181. On a bond with $100 face value, the coupon payment is 5.50 on January 10 and July 10. The accrued interest on March 5, 2018, is the share of the July 10 coupon accruing to the bondholder on March 5, 2018. Because actual/actual in period is used for Treasury bonds in the United States, this is

$$
\frac {5 4}{1 8 1} \times \$ 5. 5 0 = \$ 1. 6 4
$$

The cash price per 100 face value for the bond is therefore

$$
\$ 155.50 + \$ 1.64 = \$ 157.14
$$

Thus, the cash price of a $100,000 bond is $157,140.

# 6.2 TREASURY BOND FUTURES

Table 6.1 shows interest rate futures quotes on May 21, 2020. Trading in the Ultra T-bond futures contract started in 2010. Any government bond with a maturity over 25 years can be delivered by the party with the short position under the terms of this contract. In the T-bond futures contract, any government bond that has a maturity between 15 and 25 years can be delivered.

A Treasury note is a Treasury bond with maturity between one and ten years. As can be seen from the volume of trading, the 10-year, 5-year, and 2-year Treasury note futures contracts with short maturities are very popular. In the 10-year Treasury note futures contract, any note with a maturity between  $6\frac{1}{2}$  and 10 years can be delivered. In the 5-year and 2-year Treasury note futures contracts, the note delivered has a remaining life of about 5 years and 2 years, respectively, and the original life must be less than 5.25 years.

The 30-day Fed Funds Rate contract has a settlement price equal to 100 minus the arithmetic average of the federal funds rate during the contract month. The Eurodollar and SOFR contracts will be discussed in Section 6.3.

# Quotes

Ultra T-bond futures and Treasury bond futures contracts are quoted in dollars and thirty-seconds of a dollar per $100 face value. This is similar to the way the bonds are quoted in the spot market. In Table 6.1, the settlement price of the June 2020 Treasury bond futures contract is specified as 179-20. This means  $179_{32}^{20}$ , or 179.625. The settlement price of the 10-year Treasury note futures contract is quoted to the nearest half of a thirty-second. Thus the settlement price of 139-025 for the June 2020 contract should be interpreted as  $139_{32}^{2.5}$ , or 139.078125. The 5-year and 2-year Treasury note contracts are quoted even more precisely, to the nearest quarter of a thirty-second. Thus the opening price of 125-132 for the September 2020 5-year Treasury note contract should be interpreted as  $125_{32}^{13.25}$ , or 125.4140625. Similarly, the settlement price of 110-127 for September 2020 2-year Treasury note contract should be interpreted as  $110_{32}^{12.75}$ , or 110.3984375.

# Conversion Factors

When a particular bond is delivered in a CME group bond futures contract, a parameter known as its conversion factor defines the price received for the bond by the party with the short position. The applicable quoted price for the bond delivered is the product of the conversion factor and the most recent settlement price for the futures contract. Taking accrued interest into account (see Section 6.1), the cash received for each 100 face value of the bond delivered is

$$
\left(\text {M o s t r e c e n t s e t t l e m e n t p r i c e} \times \text {C o n v e r s i o n f a c t o r}\right) + \text {A c c r u e d i n t e r e s t}
$$

Each contract is for the delivery of  $100,000 face value of bonds. Suppose that the most recent settlement price is 120-00, the conversion factor for the bond delivered is 1.3800, and the accrued interest on this bond at the time of delivery is$ 3 per 100 face value.

The cash received by the party with the short position (and paid by the party with the long position) is then

$$
(1. 3 8 0 0 \times 1 2 0. 0 0) + 3. 0 0 = \$ 1 6 8. 6 0
$$ per  $100 face value. A party with the short position in one contract would deliver bonds with a face value of$ 100,000 and receive 168,600.


The conversion factor for a bond is set equal to the quoted price the bond would have per dollar of principal on the first day of the delivery month on the assumption that the interest rate for all maturities equals  $6\%$  per annum (with semiannual compounding). In the case of the first three contracts in Table 6.1, the bond maturity and the times to the coupon payment dates are rounded down to the nearest 3 months for the purposes of the calculation. The practice enables the exchange to produce comprehensive tables. If, after rounding, the bond lasts for an exact number of 6-month periods, the first coupon is assumed to be paid in 6 months. If, after rounding, the bond does not last for an exact number of 6-month periods (i.e., there are an extra 3 months), the first coupon is assumed to be paid after 3 months and accrued interest is subtracted.

As a first example of these rules, consider a  $10\%$  coupon bond with 20 years and 2 months to maturity that is deliverable in the T-bond futures contract. For the purposes of calculating the conversion factor, the bond is assumed to have exactly 20 years to maturity. The first coupon payment is assumed to be made after 6 months. Coupon payments are then assumed to be made at 6-month intervals until the end of the 20 years when the principal payment is made. Assume that the face value is $100. When the discount rate is  $6\%$  per annum with semiannual compounding (or  $3\%$  per 6 months), the value of the bond is

$$

\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {4 0} \frac {5}{1 . 0 3 ^ {i}} + \frac {1 0 0}{1 . 0 3 ^ {4 0}} = \$ 1 4 6. 2 3

$$

Dividing by the face value gives a conversion factor of 1.4623.

As a second example of the rules, consider an  $8\%$  coupon bond with 18 years and 4 months to maturity. For the purposes of calculating the conversion factor, the bond is assumed to have exactly 18 years and 3 months to maturity. Discounting all the payments back to a point in time 3 months from today at  $6\%$  per annum (compounded semiannually) gives a value of

$$

4 + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {3 6} \frac {4}{1 . 0 3 ^ {i}} + \frac {1 0 0}{1 . 0 3 ^ {3 6}} = \$ 1 2 5. 8 3 2 3

$$

The interest rate for a 3-month period is  $\sqrt{1.03} - 1$ , or  $1.4889\%$ . Hence, discounting back to the present gives the bond's value as  $125.8323 / 1.014889 = \$ 123.99. Subtracting the accrued interest of 2.0 gives \121.99. The conversion factor is therefore 1.2199.

In the case of the 2-year and 5-year note futures contract, a similar calculation is used to determine the conversion factor except that the time to maturity is rounded to the nearest month.

# Cheapest-to-Deliver Bond

At any given time during the delivery month, there are many bonds that can be delivered in bond futures contracts. These vary widely as far as coupon and maturity are concerned. The party with the short position can choose which of the available bonds is "cheapest" to deliver. Because the party with the short position receives


$$

\text {(M o s t r e c e n t s e t t l e m e n t p r i c e} \times \text {C o n v e r s i o n f a c t o r)} + \text {A c c r u e d i n t e r e s t}

$$ and the cost of purchasing a bond is


$$

\text {Q u o t e d b o n d p r i c e} + \text {A c c r u e d i n t e r e s t}

$$ the cheapest-to-deliver bond is the one for which


$$

\text {Q u o t e d}

$$ is least. Once the party with the short position has decided to deliver, it can determine the cheapest-to-deliver bond by examining each of the deliverable bonds in turn.


# Example 6.1

The party with the short position has decided to deliver and is trying to choose between the three bonds in the table below. Assume the most recent settlement price is 93-08, or 93.25.

<table><tr><td>Bond</td><td>Quoted bond price ($)</td><td>Conversion factor</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>99.50</td><td>1.0382</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>143.50</td><td>1.5188</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>119.75</td><td>1.2615</td></tr></table>

The cost of delivering each of the bonds is as follows:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \text {B o n d} 1: 9 9. 5 0 - (9 3. 2 5 \times 1. 0 3 8 2) = \$ 2. 6 9 \\ \text {B o n d 2 :} 1 4 3. 5 0 - (9 3. 2 5 \times 1. 5 1 8 8) = \$ 1. 8 7 \\ \text {B o n d 3 :} 1 1 9. 7 5 - (9 3. 2 5 \times 1. 2 6 1 5) = \$ 2. 1 2 \\ \end{array}

$$

The cheapest-to-deliver bond is Bond 2.

A number of factors determine the cheapest-to-deliver bond. When bond yields are in excess of  $6\%$ , the conversion factor system tends to favor the delivery of low-coupon long-maturity bonds. When yields are less than  $6\%$ , the system tends to favor the delivery of high-coupon short-maturity bonds. Also, when the yield curve is upward-sloping, there is a tendency for bonds with a long time to maturity to be favored, whereas when it is downward-sloping, there is a tendency for bonds with a short time to maturity to be delivered.

In addition to the cheapest-to-deliver bond option, the party with a short position has an option known as the wild card play. This is described in Business Snapshot 6.2.

# Determining the Futures Price

An exact theoretical futures price for the Treasury bond contract is difficult to determine because the short party's options concerned with the timing of delivery and choice of the bond that is delivered cannot easily be valued. However, if we assume that both the cheapest-to-deliver bond and the delivery date are known, the Treasury

# Business Snapshot 6.2 The Wild Card Play

The settlement price in the CME Group's Treasury bond futures contract is the price at 2:00 p.m. Chicago time. However, Treasury bonds continue trading in the spot market beyond this time and a trader with a short position can issue to the clearing house a notice of intention to deliver later in the day. If the notice is issued, the invoice price is calculated on the basis of the settlement price that day, that is, the price at 2:00 p.m.

This practice gives rise to an option known as the wild card play. If bond prices decline after 2:00 p.m. on the first day of the delivery month, the party with the short position can issue a notice of intention to deliver at, say, 3:45 p.m. and proceed to buy bonds in the spot market for delivery at a price calculated from the 2:00 p.m. futures price. If the bond price does not decline, the party with the short position keeps the position open and waits until the next day when the same strategy can be used.

As with the other options open to the party with the short position, the wild card play is not free. Its value is reflected in the futures price, which is lower than it would be without the option.

bond futures contract is a futures contract on a traded security (the bond) that provides the holder with known income. $^{1}$  Equation (5.2) then shows that the futures price,  $F_{0}$ , is related to the spot price,  $S_{0}$ , by

$$

F _ {0} = \left(S _ {0} - I\right) e ^ {r T} \tag {6.1}

$$ where  $I$  is the present value of the coupons during the life of the futures contract,  $T$  is the time until the futures contract matures, and  $r$  is the risk-free interest rate applicable to a time period of length  $T$ .

# Example 6.2

Suppose that, in a Treasury bond futures contract, it is known that the cheapest-to-deliver bond will be a  $12\%$  coupon bond with a conversion factor of 1.6000. Suppose also that it is known that delivery will take place in 270 days. Coupons are payable semiannually on the bond. As illustrated in Figure 6.1, the last coupon date was 60 days ago, the next coupon date is in 122 days, and the coupon date thereafter is in 305 days. The term structure is flat, and the rate of interest (with continuous compounding) is  $10\%$  per annum. Assume that the current quoted bond price is 115. The cash price of the bond is obtained by adding to this quoted price the proportion of the next coupon payment that accrues to the holder. The cash price is therefore

Figure 6.1 Time chart for Example 6.2.

$$
1 1 5 + \frac {6 0}{6 0 + 1 2 2} \times 6 = 1 1 6. 9 7 8
$$

A coupon of 6 will be received after 122 days (= 0.3342 years). The present value of this is

$$
6 e ^ {- 0. 1 \times 0. 3 3 4 2} = 5. 8 0 3
$$

The futures contract lasts for 270 days ( $= 0.7397$  years). The cash futures price, if the contract were written on the  $12\%$  bond, would therefore be

$$
(1 1 6. 9 7 8 - 5. 8 0 3) e ^ {0. 1 \times 0. 7 3 9 7} = 1 1 9. 7 1 1
$$

At delivery, there are 148 days of accrued interest. The quoted futures price, if the contract were written on the  $12\%$  bond, is calculated by subtracting the accrued interest

$$
1 1 9. 7 1 1 - 6 \times \frac {1 4 8}{1 4 8 + 3 5} = 1 1 4. 8 5 9
$$

From the definition of the conversion factor, 1.6000 standard bonds are considered equivalent to each  $12\%$  bond. The quoted futures price should therefore be

$$
\frac {1 1 4 . 8 5 9}{1 . 6 0 0 0} = 7 1. 7 9
$$

# 6.3 EURODOLLAR AND SOFR FUTURES

A very popular interest rate futures contract in the United States has historically been the three-month Eurodollar futures contract traded by the CME group. The underlying interest rate is three-month (90-day) U.S. dollar LIBOR and the maturities offered by the CME for this contract extend ten years into the future. Table 6.1 indicates that the volume of trading in Eurodollar futures was still quite high in May 2020. This is a little surprising given that LIBOR is being phased out at the end of 2021 (see Section 4.2). The expectation is that Eurodollar futures will over time be replaced by SOFR futures and this is slowly happening. The volume of trading and open interest for Eurodollar futures has been declining while that for SOFR futures has been increasing. In this section, we explain how both contracts work.

# Eurodollar Futures

Eurodollar futures trade until two days before the third Wednesday of the delivery month. At that point, there is a final settlement equal to  $100 - R$ , where  $R$  is the three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR fixing on that day expressed with a quarterly compounding and an actual/360 day count convention. Thus, if three-month LIBOR proved to be  $0.75\%$  two days before the third Wednesday of the delivery month, the final settlement price would be 99.250. Once a final settlement has taken place all contracts are declared closed. Table 6.1 indicates that there is trading in contracts that mature well after 2021. As explained in Section 4.2, it may well be that banks will stop providing the estimates necessary to determine LIBOR at the end of 2021. If that happens, the CME has indicated that it will base the final settlement on SOFR with appropriate adjustments for the spread between the two rates.

The contract is designed so that a one-basis-point ( = 0.01 ) move in the futures quote corresponds to a gain or loss of $25 per contract. When a Eurodollar futures quote increases by one basis point, a trader who is long one contract gains $25 and a trader who is short one contract loses $25. Similarly, when the quote decreases by one basis point a trader who is long one contract loses $25 and a trader who is short one contract gains $25. Suppose, for example, the settlement price for the September 2020 contract changes from 99.725 to 99.685 between May 21 and May 22, 2020. Traders with long positions lose 4 × 25 = $100 per contract; traders with short positions gain 100 per contract. A one-basis-point change in the futures quote corresponds to a 0.01\% change in the underlying interest rate. This in turn leads to a

$$
1, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 \times 0. 0 0 0 1 \times 0. 2 5 = 2 5
$$ or  $25 change in the interest that will be earned on$ 1 million in three months. The $25 per basis point rule is therefore consistent with the underlying interest rate applying to $1 million of principal.


The futures quote is 100 minus the futures interest rate. A trader who is long gains when interest rates fall and one who is short gains when interest rates rise. Table 6.2 shows a possible set of outcomes for the September 2020 contract in Table 6.1 for a trader who takes a long position on May 21, 2020, at the last trade price of 99.720.

The contract in Table 6.2 could be used as a hedge if LIBOR-based payments were due to be received on a principal of  $1 million for the three-month period starting on September 14, 2020. The contract locks in a LIBOR rate of 100 - 99.720$ , or  $0.28\%$  per year. The LIBOR rate on September 14, 2020, in Table 6.2 proves to be  $100 - 99.810$ , or  $0.19\%$  per year. The interest received will be  $0.25 \times 0.0019 \times \$ 1,000,000 = \ $475.$  When the  $\$ 225$ gain on the contract is taken into account, the amount received is $700, which corresponds to a LIBOR rate of  $0.28\%$  ( $0.25 \times 0.0028 \times \$ 1,000,000 = \$700.) The hedge works well, but it should be noted that it is not perfect. One reason is that

The other is that settlement is on September 14, 2020, while interest is paid three months later.[2]


# SOFR Futures

Table 6.1 shows futures quotes for one-month and three-month SOFR futures. The one-month SOFR futures contract is designed to be as similar as possible to the federal funds rate futures contract. The settlement at the end of a contract month equals 100 minus the arithmetic average of SOFR one-day rates during the month (with rates on a weekend or a holiday being assumed to be the same as the rate on the most recent business day). It can be seen that the May 2020 contract still traded on May 21, 2020, even though the rate on about two thirds of the days in the month had already been observed. The settlement futures rate implied by the May, June, and July futures contracts are  $0.0475\%$ ,  $0.055\%$ , and  $0.55\%$ , respectively. The rates implied by the corresponding federal funds futures contracts are similar. (In theory, they should be slightly higher because the federal funds rate is an unsecured rate while SOFR is secured, but in practice the difference is so small that it is not noticeable in the quotes.)

A one-month SOFR contract is designed to hedge a $5,000,000 position. In this respect, it is similar to the federal funds rate contract. When the rate implied by the contract changes by one basis point, the gain or loss per contract is $41.67. (This is consistent with the $5,000,000 size because $5,000,000 × 0.0001 × 1/12 = 41.67.) Contracts trade for the 13 months following the current month.

The three-month SOFR futures contract is designed to be as similar as possible to the Eurodollar futures contract. The settlement is on the third Wednesday of a month. It equals 100 minus the result of compounding one-day SOFR rates over the previous three months in the way described in Section 4.2. The contract month specified in Table 6.1 is the beginning of the three-month period. The delivery month is three months later. The June 2020 contract was therefore settled on September 16, 2020. The settlement price equaled  $100 - R$ , where  $R$  is the rate obtained by compounding the one-day SOFR rates observed on days between June 17, 2020, and September 15, 2020. (The rate observed on the final day of the period is not included in the compounding calculation.)

Three-month SOFR futures trade for the contract months of March, June, September, and December. Perhaps optimistically, the CME offers a total of 39 contract months so that traders can hedge or speculate on SOFR rates as far in the future as 10 years. The contract is designed to hedge a $1 million position (similarly to the Eurodollar futures contract). When the quote changes by one basis point, the gain or loss per contract is $25. Three-month SOFR futures and Eurodollar futures contracts are therefore structurally very similar. The main difference is that the Eurodollar futures contract is settled at the beginning of the three-month period to which the rate applies whereas the three-moth SOFR futures contract is settled at the end of the three-month period (after all the underlying one-day rates have been observed).

# Example 6.3

Suppose that on May 21, 2020, an investor has agreed to pay the three-month SOFR rate plus 200 basis points on 100 million of borrowings for three months beginning on December 16, 2021. From Table 6.1, the December 2021 three-month SOFR futures is  $99.990$ . The futures markets are therefore indicating a SOFR rate of only  $0.01\%$  (one basis point) for the period of the borrowings. The investor thinks that rates may increase and so would like to use futures to lock in a borrowing rate of  $2.01\%$ . The investor can do this by shorting 100 December contracts. If rates increase, the futures quote will decline and there will be a gain to compensate for the extra interest paid; if rates decrease, the quote will increase and there will be a loss on the futures, but this will be compensated for by less interest being paid.


For example, suppose that the final settlement proves to be 99.200, which corresponds to a rate of 0.8\% per annum. The rate paid on the loan would then be 2.8\% per annum and the total interest would be 0.25 × $100,000,000 × 0.028 = $700,000. However, the futures contract has declined by 79 basis points (from 99.990 to 99.200). The gain is $25 per basis point or 100 × $25 × 79 = $197,500 on 100 contracts. When this is taken into account, the amount paid is $700,000 - $197,000 = $502,500, which corresponds to a rate of 2.01\% (that is, $502,500 = 0.25 × $100,000,000 × 0.0201).

On May 21, 2020, negative SOFR rates were considered a possibility. (The Federal Reserve Board was taking steps to stimulate the economy by reducing interest rates following the Covid-19 crisis and the interest rates in some other countries were negative.) Suppose that the final settlement is 100.400. The SOFR rate applicable to the borrowings is then -0.4\% and the investor will pay 2\% - 0.4\% = 1.6\%. The interest payment will be 0.25 \times \100,000,000 \times 0.016 = \400,000. However, the futures contract has increased by 41 basis points, leading to a loss of 100 \times \25 \times 41 = \102,250 and bringing the total payment to \502,250, as before.

# Convexity Adjustments

In Chapter 5 we argued that for most contracts it is not necessary to distinguish between futures and forward prices because the two are very similar. When the futures contracts we have just considered last longer than about two years, it does become important to distinguish between futures and forward. What is termed a convexity adjustment is made so that

$$

\text {F o r w a r d R a t e} = \text {F u t u r e s R a t e} - c

$$ where  $c$  is the convexity adjustment.

One reason for the convexity adjustment is daily settlement. Consider two traders. Trader A has entered into a futures contract where there will be a gain if rates increase and a loss if rates decrease. (Trader A could be the investor in Example 6.3.) Trader B has entered into a similar forward contract. The contracts are the same except that Trader A's contract is settled daily, while Trader B's contract is settled at the end of its life. The daily settlement will tend to favor Trader A. When rates increase, Trader A makes an immediate gain and, because rates have just increased, the gain will tend to be invested at a relatively high interest rate. When rates decrease, Trader A takes an immediate loss but because rates have just decreased this will tend to be financed at a relatively low rate. To put this another way, Trader A will tend to have more funds in his or her margin account when rates are high than when rates are low. Trader B, who has entered into an FRA does not benefit from day-to-day changes in rates in this way. To compensate for this, Trader B's forward quote should be more attractive than Trader A's futures quote. In this case, a more attractive quote corresponds to a lower forward rate, so that we should expect to see a positive value for the convexity adjustment,  $c$ .

In the case of Eurodollar futures contracts, there is another consideration. The futures contracts are settled at the beginning of the time period to which the rate applies. In an FRA, as explained in Section 4.9, settlement reflects the fact the interest is normally paid at the end of a period rather than the beginning. Consider again Trader A and Trader B who will gain if rates increase and lose if rates decrease. When rates prove to be high, the impact of delaying settlement on the value of Trader B's gain is relatively high. When rates prove to be low, the impact of delaying settlement on Trader B's loss is relatively low. As a result, the difference in the timing of the settlement favors Trader A and, like daily settlement, leads to forward rates being lower than futures rates.

The convexity adjustment,  $c$ , is therefore positive. It increases as the life of the contract increases and the volatility of interest rates increase.

# Calculating Zero Curves

Futures contracts (with the convexity adjustments we have just mentioned being applied as appropriate) can be used to provide estimates of forward interest rates. These can then be used to determine zero rates. From equation (4.5) the forward rate applicable to the period between times  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$  is

$$
R _ {F} = \frac {R _ {2} T _ {2} - R _ {1} T _ {1}}{T _ {2} - T _ {1}}
$$ where  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$  are the zero rates for maturities  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , respectively. (All rates are assumed to be continuously compounded.) It follows from this that


$$

R _ {2} = \frac {R _ {F} \left(T _ {2} - T _ {1}\right) + R _ {1} T _ {1}}{T _ {2}} \tag {6.2}

$$

This equation can be used to bootstrap LIBOR or SOFR zero curves.

Consider first LIBOR. Its zero curve is known for maturities up to one year (providing banks continue to provide submissions estimating their borrowing rates). Equation (6.2) can be used to extend this zero curve, as we will now show.

# Example 6.4

A 300-day LIBOR zero rate has been calculated (using interpolation between the 6-month and 12-month rate) as  $2.80\%$  with continuous compounding. From Eurodollar futures quotes, it has been calculated that (a) the forward rate for a 90-day period beginning in 300 days is  $3.30\%$  with continuous compounding,

(b) the forward rate for a 90-day period beginning in 391 days is  $3.50\%$  with continuous compounding, and (c) the forward rate for the 90-day period beginning in 489 days is  $3.60\%$  with continuous compounding. We can use equation (6.2) to obtain the 391 rate as

$$

\frac {0 . 0 3 3 \times 9 1 + 0 . 0 2 8 \times 3 0 0}{3 9 1} = 0. 0 2 9 1 6

$$ or  $2.916\%$ . Similarly we can use the second forward rate to determine to 489-day rate as

$$
\frac {0 . 0 3 5 \times 9 8 + 0 . 0 2 9 1 6 \times 3 9 1}{4 8 9} = 0. 0 3 0 3 3
$$ or  $3.033\%$ . The next forward rate would be used to extend the zero curve for a further three months, and so on. Note that even though the rate underlying the Eurodollar futures contract is a 90-day rate, it is assumed to apply to the 91 or 98 days between contract maturities to facilitate the bootstrapping.


Determining short-maturity SOFR rates requires a little more work. We illustrate this with another example.

# Example 6.5

It is October and the current three-month SOFR futures contract has two months until the December delivery date. Suppose further that compounding the overnight rates (already observed) for the first month of the contract gives a rate of  $2\%$  per year and that the futures quote gives a rate for the whole three-month period of  $2.5\%$  per year. If all rates are expressed with continuous compounding, the implied zero rate,  $R$ , for the next two months is given by solving

$$
0. 0 2 \times (1 / 1 2) + R \times (2 / 1 2) = 0. 0 2 5 \times (3 / 1 2)
$$

It is 0.0275, or  $2.75\%$ . The forward rate calculated from the contract covering the December to March period can be used in conjunction with this estimate and equation (6.2) to obtain the 5-month zero rate as in Example 6.4. The contract covering the March to June period can similarly determine the 8-month zero rate, and so on.

# 6.4 DURATION-BASED HEDGING STRATEGIES USING FUTURES

We discussed duration in Section 4.10. Interest rate futures can be used to hedge the yield on a bond portfolio at a future time. Define:

$V_{F}$ : Contract price for one interest rate futures contract

$D_F$ : Duration of the asset underlying the futures contract at the maturity of the futures contract

$P$ : Forward value of the portfolio being hedged at the maturity of the hedge (in practice, this is usually assumed to be the same as the value of the portfolio today)

$D_P$ : Duration of the portfolio at the maturity of the hedge.

If we assume that the change in the forward yield,  $\Delta y$ , is the same for all maturities, it is approximately true that

$$

\Delta P = - P D _ {P} \Delta y

$$

It is also approximately true that

$$

\Delta V _ {F} = - V _ {F} D _ {F} \Delta y

$$

The number of contracts required to hedge against an uncertain  $\Delta y$ , therefore, is

$$

N ^ {*} = \frac {P D _ {P}}{V _ {F} D _ {F}} \tag {6.3}

$$

This is the duration-based hedge ratio. It is sometimes also called the price sensitivity hedge ratio.

When the hedging instrument is a Treasury bond futures contract, the hedger must base  $D_F$  on an assumption that one particular bond will be delivered. This means that the hedger must estimate which of the available bonds is likely to be cheapest to deliver at the time the hedge is put in place. If, subsequently, the interest rate environment changes so that it looks as though a different bond will be cheapest to deliver, then the hedge has to be adjusted and as a result its performance may be worse than anticipated.

When hedges are constructed using interest rate futures, it is important to bear in mind that interest rates and futures prices move in opposite directions. When interest rates go up, an interest rate futures price goes down. When interest rates go down, the reverse happens, and the interest rate futures price goes up. Thus, a company in a position to lose money if interest rates drop should hedge by taking a long futures position. Similarly, a company in a position to lose money if interest rates rise should hedge by taking a short futures position.

The hedger tries to choose the futures contract so that the duration of the underlying asset is as close as possible to the duration of the asset being hedged. Eurodollar futures tend to be used for exposures to short-term interest rates, whereas ultra T-bond, Treasury bond, and Treasury note futures contracts are used for exposures to longer-term rates.

# Example 6.6

It is August 2 and a fund manager with  $10 million invested in government bonds is concerned that interest rates are expected to be highly volatile over the next 3 months. The fund manager decides to use the December T-bond futures contract to hedge the value of the portfolio. The current futures price is 93-02, or 93.0625. Because each contract is for the delivery of$ 100,000 face value of bonds, the futures contract price is 93,062.50.

Suppose that the duration of the bond portfolio in 3 months will be 6.80 years. The cheapest-to-deliver bond in the T-bond contract is expected to be a 20-year  $12\%$  per annum coupon bond. The yield on this bond is currently  $8.80\%$  per annum, and the duration will be 9.20 years at maturity of the futures contract.

# Business Snapshot 6.3 Asset-Liability Management by Banks

The asset-liability management (ALM) committees of banks now monitor their exposure to interest rates very carefully. Matching the durations of assets and liabilities is sometimes a first step, but this does not protect a bank against non-parallel shifts in the yield curve. A popular approach is known as  $GAP$  management. This involves dividing the zero-coupon yield curve into segments, known as buckets. The first bucket might be 0 to 1 month, the second 1 to 3 months, and so on. The ALM committee then investigates the effect on the value of the bank's portfolio of the zero rates corresponding to one bucket changing while those corresponding to all other buckets stay the same.

If there is a mismatch, corrective action is usually taken. This can involve changing deposit and lending rates in the way described in Section 4.12. Alternatively, tools such as swaps, FRAs, bond futures, Eurodollar futures, and other interest rate derivatives can be used.

The fund manager requires a short position in T-bond futures to hedge the bond portfolio. If interest rates go up, a gain will be made on the short futures position, but a loss will be made on the bond portfolio. If interest rates decrease, a loss will be made on the short position, but there will be a gain on the bond portfolio. The number of bond futures contracts that should be shorted can be calculated from equation (6.3) as

$$

\frac {1 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0}{9 3 , 0 6 2 . 5 0} \times \frac {6 . 8 0}{9 . 2 0} = 7 9. 4 2

$$

To the nearest whole number, the portfolio manager should short 79 contracts.

# 6.5 HEDGING PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Financial institutions sometimes attempt to hedge themselves against interest rate risk by ensuring that the average duration of their assets equals the average duration of their liabilities. (The liabilities can be regarded as short positions in bonds.) This strategy is known as duration matching or portfolio immunization. When implemented, it ensures that a small parallel shift in interest rates will have little effect on the value of the portfolio of assets and liabilities. The gain (loss) on the assets should offset the loss (gain) on the liabilities.

Duration matching does not immunize a portfolio against nonparallel shifts in the zero curve. This is a weakness of the approach. In practice, short-term rates are usually more volatile than, and are not perfectly correlated with, long-term rates. Sometimes it even happens that short- and long-term rates move in opposite directions to each other. Duration matching is therefore only a first step and financial institutions have developed other tools to help them manage their interest rate exposure. See Business Snapshot 6.3.

# SUMMARY

In the Treasury bond futures contracts, the party with the short position has a number of interesting delivery options:

1. Delivery can be made on any day during the delivery month.
2. There are a number of alternative bonds that can be delivered.
3. On any day during the delivery month, the notice of intention to deliver at the 2:00 p.m. settlement price can be made later in the day.

These options all tend to reduce the futures price.

The Eurodollar futures contract is a contract on the 3-month LIBOR interest rate two days before the third Wednesday of the delivery month. It is expected that as LIBOR is phased out this will be replaced by the 3-month SOFR futures contract. This is a futures contract on the rate obtained by compounding one-day SOFR rates over a three-month period.

The concept of duration is important in hedging interest rate risk. It enables a hedger to assess the sensitivity of a bond portfolio to small parallel shifts in the yield curve. It also enables the hedger to assess the sensitivity of an interest rate futures price to small changes in the yield curve. The number of futures contracts necessary to protect the bond portfolio against small parallel shifts in the yield curve can therefore be calculated.

The key assumption underlying duration-based hedging is that all interest rates change by the same amount. This means that only parallel shifts in the term structure are allowed for. In practice, short-term interest rates are generally more volatile than are long-term interest rates, and hedge performance is liable to be poor if the duration of the bond underlying the futures contract differs markedly from the duration of the asset being hedged.

The birth of the over-the-counter swap market can be traced to a currency swap negotiated between IBM and the World Bank in 1981. The World Bank had borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars while IBM had borrowings denominated in German deutsche marks and Swiss francs. The World Bank (which was restricted in the deutsche mark and Swiss franc borrowing it could do directly) agreed to make interest payments on IBM's borrowings while IBM in return agreed to make interest payments on the World Bank's borrowings. Since that first transaction in 1981, the swap market has seen phenomenal growth.

A swap is an over-the-counter agreement between two companies to exchange cash flows in the future. The agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way in which they are to be calculated. Usually the calculation of the cash flows involves the future value of an interest rate, an exchange rate, or other market variable.

A forward contract can be viewed as a simple example of a swap. Suppose it is March 1, 2022, and a company enters into a forward contract to buy 100 ounces of gold for  $1,700 per ounce in one year. The company can sell the gold in one year as soon as it is received. The forward contract is therefore equivalent to a swap where the company agrees that on March 1, 2023, it will pay$ 170,000 and receive 100S, where S is the market price of one ounce of gold on that date.

Whereas a forward contract is equivalent to the exchange of cash flows on just one future date, swaps typically lead to cash-flow exchanges taking place on several future dates. In this chapter we examine how swaps are used and how they are valued. Our discussion centers on interest rate swaps and currency swaps. Other types of swaps are briefly reviewed at the end of this chapter and discussed in more detail in Chapter 34.

# 7.1 MECHANICS OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS

An interest rate swap is a swap where interest at a predetermined fixed rate, applied to a certain principal, is exchanged for interest at a floating reference rate, applied to the same principal, with regular exchanges being made for an agreed period of time. Historically, the most common floating reference interest rate in an interest rate swap has been LIBOR. For example, a swap negotiated in the past might be an agreement to exchange interest at 2\% on a principal of \50 million for interest at three-month LIBOR on the same principal for the next five years with exchanges every three months.


As explained in Chapter 4, LIBOR has proved to be an unsatisfactory reference rate because it is based on estimates made by banks, not on actual transactions. The plan in financial markets is to phase out the use of LIBOR and replace it by a reference rate based on overnight transactions between banks. The transition period will be tricky for the swaps market. Many LIBOR-for-fixed swaps have been negotiated in the past with long lives and will continue to be in existence after the use of LIBOR has been discontinued. For example, a 20-year swap negotiated at the end of 2013 will still have 12 years to run at the end of 2021 (which was the original date chosen for the end of LIBOR). If banks stop providing LIBOR estimates after the end of 2021, it will be necessary for the market to agree on a way of estimating LIBOR from the new reference rates. For example, three-month U.S. LIBOR is likely to be estimated as three-month SOFR plus  $x$ , where  $x$  is some average of the difference between the two rates observed in the past.

At this point, it is worth reviewing the differences between LIBOR and the overnight reference rates that are replacing it:

LIBOR rates are the borrowing rates estimated by banks in the interbank market for periods between one day and one year.
- Overnight rates such as SOFR and SONIA are based on actual transactions between banks.
- The overnight rates are converted to longer reference rates using what might be termed an "averaging process." Usually the averaging involves daily compounding as described in Section 4.2, but occasionally a simple arithmetic average is used (as for CME's one-month SOFR futures).
- LIBOR rates for a period are known at the beginning of the period to which they apply, whereas the result of the averaging process for overnight rates is known only at the end of the period.
- LIBOR rates incorporate some credit risk, whereas rates based on overnight rates such as SOFR and SONIA are considered to be risk-free rates.

As LIBOR is phased out, swaps based on overnight rates are becoming more popular. These are referred to as overnight indexed swaps (OISs).

An OIS is an agreement to exchange a fixed rate of interest for a reference rate of interest that is calculated from realized overnight rates. A simple example of an OIS is a swap lasting for three months. This leads to a single exchange at the end of the three months. The fixed rate of interest applied to a certain principal is exchanged for the reference rate applied to the same principal. Other similar OISs that last for one month, six months, and one year lead to a single exchange calculated in a similar way. When the life of the OIS is greater than one year, it is typically divided into three-month subperiods, with the fixed rate being exchanged at the end of each three-month period for the three-month reference rate that is calculated for that period from one-day rates. OISs lasting ten years or longer are now traded.

Consider a hypothetical two-year OIS initiated on March 8, 2022, between Apple and Citigroup. We suppose Apple agrees to pay to Citigroup interest at the rate of  $3\%$  per annum every three months on a notional principal of 100 million, and in return Citigroup agrees to pay Apple the three-month SOFR floating reference rate on the same notional principal. Apple is the fixed-rate payer; Citigroup is the floating-rate payer. For ease of exposition, we assume that rates are quoted with quarterly compounding and we ignore the impact of day count conventions and holiday conventions (which are explained later in this chapter). The swap is shown in Figure 7.1.

Figure 7.1 Interest rate swap between Apple and Citigroup.


In total there are eight exchanges on the swap. One possible outcome is shown in Table 7.1. The first exchange of payments would take place on June 8, 2022. Apple would pay Citigroup  $750,000 (one quarter of 3\%$  applied to 100 million). Citigroup would pay Apple the three-month rate calculated from daily SOFR rates over the previous three months. The 3-month SOFR rate calculated on June 8, 2022 (from overnight rates between March 8, 2022, and June 8, 2022) is assumed to be  $2.2\%$  per annum or  $0.55\%$  per three months using the formula in Section 4.2. The floating payment from Citigroup to Apple is therefore $550,000. The fixed and floating payments are netted with the result that Apple pays Citigroup $200,000 on June 8, 2022. The second exchange of payments is on September 8, 2022. Again, the fixed payment from Apple to Citigroup is $750,000. We assume that the 3-month SOFR rate on September 8, 2022 (calculated from overnight rates between June 8, 2022 and September 8, 2022) is  $2.6\%$  per annum or  $0.65\%$  per three months. The floating payment is therefore $650,000 and the net payment from Apple to Citigroup is therefore 100,000.

What is the difference between an OIS and a LIBOR swap? If the heading of the second column in Table 7.1 is changed to "LIBOR rate" the table could provide an example of a LIBOR swap. The difference is that the LIBOR rate for a period is known at the beginning of the period, whereas the overnight reference rate is not known until the end of the period. The  $2.20\%$  floating rate applicable to the first exchange on June 8, 2002, if LIBOR, would be known at the beginning of the swap's life on March 8, 2022; the  $2.60\%$  floating rate applicable to the second exchange on September 8, 2022, would be known on June 8, 2022; and so on.

# 7.2 DETERMINING RISK-FREE RATES

Overnight indexed swaps play an important role in determining the risk-free rates which are needed for valuing derivatives.

OISs, when first entered into, into have a value of zero. (In this respect an OIS is like a forward contract.) The fixed rate that is exchanged for floating is referred to as the OIS rate. The OIS rates for a range of maturities can be observed in the market at a particular time. OIS rates with maturities one year or less, because they lead to just one exchange, have a straightforward interpretation. They provide the risk-free zero rates that are equivalent to the underlying overnight rates.

Now consider OIS rates for maturities greater than a year. The notional principal is not exchanged in an OIS. (This is why the principal is termed "notional.") However, if we did exchange the notional principal at the end of the life of the swap, the cash exchanges would not change in any way because the notional principal is the same for both the fixed and floating payments. Table 7.2 is produced from Table 7.1 by adding exchanges of principal at the end. The table shows that the swap is equivalent to the exchange of a floating rate bond (cash flows in the third column) for a fixed rate bond (cash flows in the fourth column).

A key point is that the floating-rate bond in Table 7.2 is worth $100,000. This is because it provides the payments necessary to service $100 million of borrowings at overnight rates. (To see this, imagine that (a) $100 million plus accumulated interest is borrowed at successive overnight rates during each quarter, (b) the accumulated interest is paid at the end of each quarter, and (c) $100 million principal is repaid at the end of the two years.) Because an OIS is worth zero when first entered into, the fixed-rate bond (fourth column of Table 7.2) must also be worth 100 million. This shows that the OIS rate of 3\% is the interest rate on a two-year fixed-rate bond that is worth par and pays interest quarterly.

OIS rates can therefore be used in the same way as the Treasury rates in Section 4.7 to define a zero curve. The OIS rates out to one year define zero rates in a direct way. The OIS rates for longer maturities define bonds worth par. The zero curve can be assumed

Table 7.2 Cash flows in Table 7.1 when the notional principal is exchanged at the end.

A example of the result of the calculations is shown in Table 7.3 and Figure 7.2. In this example, the two-year and five-year zero rates would be chosen using an iterative search procedure (such as Solver in Excel) so that they are consistent with the following:
- A two-year bond making quarterly interest payments at  $3\%$  per annum is worth par.
- A five-year bond making quarterly interest payments at  $4\%$  per annum is worth par.

# 7.3 REASONS FOR TRADING INTEREST RATE SWAPS

Swaps have proved to be very popular because they have many uses, as we will now explain. Most of the discussion of interest rate swaps in the next few sections applies regardless of the floating reference rate used. For ease of exposition we will therefore simply refer to the floating rate as "floating."

# Using the Swap to Transform a Liability

For Apple, the swap in Figure 7.1 could be used to transform a floating-rate loan into a fixed-rate loan, as indicated in Figure 7.3. Suppose that Apple has arranged to borrow 100 million for two years at the floating rate plus 10 basis points. (One basis point is

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/8953740fb4628d3b21cc26eb0e550b5380e4d3b3a9252492954951b482843105.jpg)

Figure 7.3 Apple uses the swap in Figure 7.1 to convert floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings.

$0.01\%$ , so the rate is floating plus  $0.1\%$ .) After Apple has entered into the swap, it has three sets of cash flows:

1. It pays floating plus  $0.1\%$  to its outside lenders.
2. It receives floating under the terms of the swap.
3. It pays  $3\%$  under the terms of the swap.

These three sets of cash flows net out to an interest rate payment of  $3.1\%$ . Thus, for Apple the swap could have the effect of transforming borrowings at the floating rate plus 10 basis points into borrowings at a fixed rate of  $3.1\%$ .

A company wishing to transform a fixed-rate loan into a floating-rate loan would enter into the opposite swap. Suppose that Intel has borrowed 100 million at 3.2\% for two years and wishes to switch to the floating rate. Like Apple, it contacts Citigroup. We assume that it agrees to enter into a swap where it pays the floating rate and receives 2.97\%. Its position would then be as indicated in Figure 7.4. It has three sets of cash flows:

1. It pays  $3.2\%$  to its outside lenders.
2. It pays floating under the terms of the swap.
3. It receives  $2.97\%$  under the terms of the swap.

These three sets of cash flows net out to an interest rate payment of floating plus  $0.23\%$  (or floating plus 23 basis points). Thus, for Intel the swap could have the effect of transforming borrowings at a fixed rate of  $3.2\%$  into borrowings at the floating rate plus 23 basis points.

# Using the Swap to Transform an Asset

Swaps can also be used to transform the nature of an asset. Consider Apple in our example. The swap in Figure 7.1 could have the effect of transforming an asset earning a fixed rate of interest into an asset earning a floating rate of interest. Suppose that Apple owns $100 million in bonds that will provide interest at  $2.7\%$  per annum over the next two years. After Apple has entered into the swap, it is in the position shown in Figure 7.5. It has three sets of cash flows:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/62e91c476dc2ca818346a69d2c468b72258c45d874e833b84ba309d7cf6adc4e.jpg)
Figure 7.4 Intel uses a swap to convert fixed-rate borrowings into floating-rate borrowings.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/58148cb7c55468db0023849d49f14950ffbab838a6b5deabffd7b88d8ede8477.jpg)
Figure 7.5 Apple uses the swap in Figure 7.1 to convert a fixed-rate investment into a floating-rate investment.


1. It receives  $2.7\%$  on the bonds.
2. It receives floating under the terms of the swap.
3. It pays  $3\%$  under the terms of the swap.

These three sets of cash flows net out to an interest rate inflow of floating minus 30 basis points. The swap has therefore transformed an asset earning  $2.7\%$  into an asset earning floating minus 30 basis points.

Consider next the swap entered into by Intel in Figure 7.4. The swap could have the effect of transforming an asset earning a floating rate of interest into an asset earning a fixed rate of interest. Suppose that Intel has an investment of 100 million that yields floating minus 20 basis points. After it has entered into the swap, it is in the position shown in Figure 7.6. It has three sets of cash flows:

1. It receives floating minus 20 basis points on its investment.
2. It pays floating under the terms of the swap.
3. It receives  $2.97\%$  under the terms of the swap.

These three sets of cash flows net out to an interest rate inflow of  $2.77\%$ . Thus, one possible use of the swap for Intel is to transform an asset earning floating minus 20 basis points into an asset earning  $2.77\%$ .

# 7.4 THE ORGANIZATION OF TRADING

Financial institutions such as Citigroup act as market makers and provide bid and ask quotes for the fixed rates that they are prepared to exchange in swaps. Table 7.4 shows the full set of quotes that might be made at the time of the trades considered in Figures 7.3 to 7.6. The bid quote is the fixed rate that applies when the financial

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/a28dbe23981a7918558a1a5460ea2775c4e6abda067b5e4e72c7ece3a4259591.jpg)
Figure 7.6 Intel uses the swap in Figure 7.3 to convert a floating-rate investment into a fixed-rate investment.

<table><tr><td>Maturity (years)</td><td>Bid</td><td>Ask</td><td>Swap rate</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2.97</td><td>3.00</td><td>2.985</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3.05</td><td>3.08</td><td>3.065</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3.15</td><td>3.19</td><td>3.170</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3.26</td><td>3.30</td><td>3.280</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>3.40</td><td>3.44</td><td>3.420</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>3.48</td><td>3.52</td><td>3.500</td></tr></table> institution is paying the fixed rate and receiving floating. The ask quote is the fixed rate that applies when it is receiving the fixed rate and paying floating. The average of the bid and ask rates is known as the swap rate and is shown in the final column. The spread between the bid and the ask (three to four basis points in the table) compensates the market maker for its costs.


Occasionally a market maker may be lucky enough to enter into offsetting trades with two different nonfinancial companies. Usually, however, when it enters into a trade with a nonfinancial company, it must enter into the opposite trade with another financial institution to hedge its risk. This is less profitable. Also, as explained in earlier chapters, the financial crisis of 2008 led to an international agreement that standard swaps between financial institutions be traded on electronic platforms and cleared though central counterparties (CCPs). This agreement would not apply to the swap in Figures 7.4 and 7.6 because Intel is a nonfinancial company, but it would apply to Citigroup's hedging trade with another financial institution. Whereas the trade with Intel might require no collateral to be posted, the hedging trade with another financial institution would require both initial and variation margin because it would be cleared through a CCP. This point is discussed further in Chapter 9.

# Day Count Issues

We discussed day count conventions in Section 6.1. The day count conventions affect payments on a swap and mean that some of the numbers calculated in the examples we have given earlier in this chapter are only approximately correct. Floating reference rates such as SOFR and U.S. LIBOR are quoted on an actual/360 basis. The first floating payment in Table 7.1 is based on a rate of  $2.2\%$ . Because there are 92 days between March 8, 2022, and June 8, 2022, the floating payment that reflects an actual/360 day count is

$$

\$ 100,000,000 \times 0.022 \times \frac {92}{360} = \$ 562,222

$$

In general, it is  $LRn / 360$  where  $L$  is the principal,  $R$  is the floating rate, and  $n$  is the number of days in the accrual period.

The fixed rate in a swap is also quoted with a day count convention. Popular fixed-rate day counts are actual/365 and 30/360. This means that the fixed and floating rates are often not directly comparable because one applies to 360 days while the other applies to a full year. Also, in the case of actual/365, the fixed-rate cash flows in a swap will vary slightly according to the number of days in the applicable period.

For ease of exposition, we will ignore day count issues in our valuations in this chapter.

# Confirmations

When swaps are traded bilaterally a legal agreement, known as a confirmation, is signed by representatives of the two parties. The drafting of confirmations has been facilitated by the work of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) in New York. This organization has produced a number of Master Agreements that are designed to cover all over-the-counter derivative transactions between two parties and define what happens in the event of default by either side, collateral requirements (if any), and so on. Business Snapshot 7.1 shows a possible extract from the confirmation for the swap between Apple and the Citigroup in Figure 7.1. Almost certainly, the full confirmation would state that the provisions of an ISDA Master Agreement apply to the contract.

The confirmation specifies that the following business day convention is to be used and that the U.S. calendar determines which days are business days and which days are holidays. This means that, if a payment date falls on a weekend or a U.S. holiday, the payment is made on the next business day.[2]

# 7.5 THE COMPARATIVE-ADVANTAGE ARGUMENT

An explanation commonly put forward to explain the popularity of swaps concerns comparative advantages. In this context, a comparative advantage is advantage that leads to company being treated more favorably in one debt market than in another debt market. Consider the use of an interest rate swap to transform a liability. Some companies, it is argued, have a comparative advantage when borrowing in fixed-rate markets, whereas other companies have a comparative advantage when borrowing in floating-rate markets. To obtain a new loan, it makes sense for a company to go to the market where it has a comparative advantage. As a result, the company may borrow fixed when it wants floating, or borrow floating when it wants fixed. The swap is used to transform a fixed-rate loan into a floating-rate loan, and vice versa.

# Illustration

Suppose that two companies, AAACorp and BBBCorp, both wish to borrow 10 million for five years and have been offered the rates shown in Table 7.5. AAACorp has a AAA credit rating; BBBCorp has a BBB credit rating. We assume that BBBCorp wants to borrow at a fixed rate of interest, whereas AAACorp wants to borrow at a floating rate. Since BBBCorp has a worse credit rating than AAACorp, it pays a higher rate of interest in both fixed and floating markets.

A key feature of the rates offered to AAACorp and BBBCorp is that the difference between the two fixed rates is greater than that between the two floating rates. BBBCorp pays  $1.2\%$  more than AAACorp in fixed-rate markets and only  $0.7\%$  more than AAACorp in floating-rate markets. BBBCorp appears to have a comparative advantage in floating-rate markets, whereas AAACorp appears to have a comparative advantage in fixed-rate markets. It is this apparent anomaly that can lead to a swap being negotiated. AAACorp borrows fixed-rate funds at  $4\%$  per annum. BBBCorp borrows funds at floating plus  $0.6\%$  per annum. They then enter into a swap agreement to ensure that AAACorp ends up with floating-rate funds and BBBCorp with fixed-rate funds.

To understand how the swap might work, we first assume (somewhat unrealistically) that AAACorp and BBBCorp get in touch with each other directly. The sort of swap

Table 7.5 Borrowing rates that provide a basis for the comparative-advantage argument. "Floating" is the floating reference rate.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Fixed rate</td><td>Floating rate</td></tr><tr><td>AAACorp</td><td>4.0\%</td><td>Floating -0.1\%</td></tr><tr><td>BBBCorp</td><td>5.2\%</td><td>Floating +0.6\%</td></tr></table> they might negotiate is shown in Figure 7.7. AAACorp agrees to pay BBBCorp interest at a floating reference rate on  $10 million. In return, BBBCorp agrees to pay AAACorp interest at a fixed rate of 4.35\%$  per annum on 10 million.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/d5429ebac5dcf8d7e8e6dbad354d2563e880d7d309b2bdd402c404a2602347ee.jpg)
Figure 7.7 Swap agreement between AAACorp and BBBCorp when rates in Table 7.5 apply.


AAACorp has three sets of interest rate cash flows:

1. It pays  $4\%$  per annum to outside lenders.
2. It receives  $4.35\%$  per annum from BBBCorp.
3. It pays floating to BBBCorp.

The net effect of the three cash flows is that AAACorp pays floating minus  $0.35\%$  per annum. This is  $0.25\%$  per annum less than it would pay if it went directly to floating-rate markets.

BBBCorp also has three sets of interest rate cash flows:

1. It pays floating  $+0.6\%$  per annum to outside lenders.
2. It receives floating from AAACorp.
3. It pays  $4.35\%$  per annum to AAACorp.

The net effect of the three cash flows is that BBBCorp pays  $4.95\%$  per annum. This is  $0.25\%$  per annum less than it would pay if it went directly to fixed-rate markets.

In this example, the swap has been structured so that the net gain to both sides is the same,  $0.25\%$ . This need not be the case. However, the total apparent gain from this type of interest rate swap arrangement is always  $a - b$ , where  $a$  is the difference between the interest rates facing the two companies in fixed-rate markets, and  $b$  is the difference between the interest rates facing the two companies in floating-rate markets. In this case,  $a = 1.2\%$  and  $b = 0.7\%$ , so that the total gain is  $0.5\%$ .

If the transaction between AAACorp and BBBCorp were brokered by a financial institution, an arrangement such as that shown in Figure 7.8 might result. In this case, AAACorp ends up borrowing at floating  $-0.33\%$ , BBBCorp ends up borrowing at  $4.97\%$ , and the financial institution earns a spread of four basis points per year. The gain to AAACorp is  $0.23\%$ ; the gain to BBBCorp is  $0.23\%$ ; and the gain to the financial institution is  $0.04\%$ . The total gain to all three parties is  $0.5\%$  as before.

# Criticism of the Comparative-Advantage Argument

The comparative-advantage argument we have just outlined for explaining the attractiveness of interest rate swaps is open to question. Why in Table 7.5 should the spreads between the rates offered to AAACorp and BBBCorp be different in fixed and floating markets? Now that the interest rate swap market has been in existence for a long time, we might reasonably expect these types of differences to have been arbitraged away.

The reason that spread differentials appear to exist is due to the nature of the contracts available to companies in fixed and floating markets. Suppose that the floating reference rate is a three-month rate. The  $4.0\%$  and  $5.2\%$  rates available to AAACorp and BBBCorp in fixed-rate markets are five-year rates (for example, the rates at which the companies can issue five-year fixed-rate bonds). The rates offered in floating-rate markets are three-month rates. In the floating-rate market, the lender usually has the opportunity to review the spread above the floating reference rate every time rates are reset. (In our example, rates are reset quarterly.) If the creditworthiness of AAACorp or BBBCorp has declined, the lender has the option of increasing the spread over the floating reference rate that is charged. In extreme circumstances, the lender can refuse to continue the loan. The providers of fixed-rate financing do not have the option to change the terms of the loan in this way.[5]

The spreads between the rates offered to AAACorp and BBBCorp are a reflection of the extent to which BBBCorp is more likely to default than AAACorp. During the next three months, there is very little chance that either AAACorp or BBBCorp will default. As we look further ahead, default statistics show that on average the probability of a default by a company with a BBB credit rating increases faster than the probability of a default by a company with a AAA credit rating. This is why the spread between the five-year rates is greater than the spread between the three-month floating rates.

After negotiating a loan at floating  $+0.6\%$  and entering into the swap shown in Figure 7.8, BBBCorp appears to obtain a fixed-rate loan at  $4.97\%$ . The arguments just presented show that this is not really the case. In practice, the rate paid is  $4.97\%$  only if BBBCorp can continue to borrow floating-rate funds at a spread of  $0.6\%$  over the floating reference rate. If, for example, the credit rating of BBBCorp declines so that the floating-rate loan is rolled over at floating  $+1.6\%$ , the rate paid by BBBCorp increases to  $5.97\%$ . The market expects that BBBCorp's spread over the floating reference rate will on average rise during the swap's life. BBBCorp's expected average borrowing rate when it enters into the swap is therefore greater than  $4.97\%$ .

The swap in Figure 7.8 locks in  $0.33\%$  below the floating reference rate for AAACorp for the next five years, not just for the next three months. This appears to be a good deal for AAACorp. The downside is that unless collateral is posted it is bearing the risk of a default by the financial institution. If it borrowed floating-rate funds in the usual way, it would not be bearing this risk.

# 7.6 VALUATION OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS

We now move on to discuss the valuation of interest rate swaps. An interest rate swap is worth close to zero when it is first initiated. After it has been in existence for some time, its value may be positive or negative.

Each exchange of payment in a swap can be regarded as a forward rate agreement (FRA). As shown at the end of Section 4.9, an FRA can be valued by assuming that forward rates are realized. Because it is nothing more than a portfolio of FRAs, an interest rate swap can also be valued by assuming that forward rates are realized. The procedure is:

1. Calculate forward rates for each of the unknown floating rates that will determine swap cash flows.
2. Calculate the swap cash flows on the assumption that unknown floating rates will equal forward rates.
3. Discount the swap cash flows at the risk-free rate.

The value of a swap therefore requires a calculation of forward rates corresponding to all floating payments and risk-free rates to discount the net cash flows from payments dates to the present. We explained how to calculate a risk-free zero curve from OIS rates earlier in the chapter. This provides the necessary risk-free rates. Furthermore, if the swap is an OIS, the relevant forward rates can be calculated from this risk-free zero curve using the formulas in Section 4.8. Note that the first rate required is not really a forward rate. It is a blend of one-day rates already observed and the zero rate that corresponds to the remaining one-day rates in the period.

In the case of a LIBOR swap, the necessary forward rates are estimated from Eurodollar futures and swap rates (assuming these are available). Eurodollar futures provide a direct estimate of forward rates (although a convexity adjustment might be necessary as discussed in Chapter 6). In the case of swap rates, we use that fact that swap rates such as those in Table 7.4 define swaps that are worth zero. This provides equations that must be satisfied by forward rates. With appropriate interpolation a complete forward curve consistent with the swaps rates can be obtained. Note that the first LIBOR payment has generally already been determined and does not require a forward rate calculation.

# Example 7.1

Suppose that some time ago a financial institution entered into a swap where it agreed to make semiannual payments at a rate of  $3\%$  per annum and receive the SOFR six-month reference rate on a notional principal of $100 million. The swap now has a remaining life of 1.2 years. Payments will therefore be exchanged at 0.2, 0.7, and 1.2 years. Assume the risk-free rates with continuous compounding (calculated from SOFR) for 0.2, 0.7, and 1.2 years are  $2.8\%$ ,  $3.2\%$ , and  $3.4\%$ , respectively. Assume also that the continuously compounded risk-free rate observed for the last 0.3 years (which contain  $60\%$  of the days that will determine the exchange at 0.2 years) is  $2.3\%$ . The floating rate for the exchange at 0.2 years is assumed to be  $0.6 \times 2.3\% + 0.4 \times 2.8\%$ , or  $2.50\%$ . The floating rate for exchange at 0.7 years is the forward rate for the period between 0.2 and 0.7 years. This is  $3.36\%$  with continuous compounding. Similarly, the floating rate for the exchange at 1.2 years is the forward rate for the period between 0.7 years and 1.2 years. This is  $3.68\%$  with continuous compounding.

The swap is therefore valued assuming that the three floating rates are  $2.50\%$ ,  $3.36\%$ , and  $3.68\%$  with continuous compounding. With semiannual compounding, these rates become  $2.516\%$ ,  $3.388\%$ , and  $3.714\%$ . The calculations for valuing the swap are therefore as indicated in the following table (all cash flows are in millions of dollars):


<table><tr><td>Time (years)</td><td>Fixed cash flow</td><td>Floating cash flow</td><td>Net cash flow</td><td>Discount factor</td><td>Present value of net cash flow</td></tr><tr><td>0.2</td><td>-1.500</td><td>+1.258</td><td>-0.242</td><td>0.9944</td><td>-0.241</td></tr><tr><td>0.7</td><td>-1.500</td><td>+1.694</td><td>+0.194</td><td>0.9778</td><td>+0.190</td></tr><tr><td>1.2</td><td>-1.500</td><td>+1.857</td><td>+0.357</td><td>0.9600</td><td>+0.343</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>+0.292</td></tr></table>

Consider,forexample,the0.7yearrow. The fixedcash flowis -0.5 × 0.03 × 100, or -$1.500 million. The floating cash flow, assuming forward rates are realized, is 0.5 × 0.03388 × 100, or $1.694 million. The net cash flow is therefore $0.194 million. The discount factor is e-0.032×0.7 = 0.9778, so that the present value is $0.194 × 0.9778 = 0.190.

The value of the swap is obtained by summing the present values. It is 0.292 million. (Note that these calculations are approximate because they do not take account of holiday calendars and day count conventions.)

# 7.7 HOW THE VALUE CHANGES THROUGH TIME

The fixed rate in an interest rate swap is chosen so that the swap is worth zero initially. This does not mean that each cash flow exchange in the swap is worth zero initially. Instead, it means that the sum of the values of the cash flow exchanges is zero. Figure 7.9 shows two alternative situations in swap where there are ten cash-flow exchanges.

Figure 7.9a would arise in the situation where the term structure of interest rates is upward sloping and a fixed rate of interest is being received while the floating rate is paid. The upward-sloping term structure produces forward rates that increase with maturity. As a result the value of the exchanges decreases with maturity. Because the sum of the exchanges is zero, it follows that the early exchanges must have a positive value while the later ones have a negative value. If the term structure of rates is upward sloping and the fixed rate is being paid while the floating rate is received, a similar argument shows that the early exchanges will have a negative value while the later exchanges have a positive value. This is the situation in Figure 7.9b. When the term structure is downward sloping, the position is reversed, so that Figure 7.9a shows the situation where the fixed rate is paid and Figure 7.9b where the fixed rate is received.

These results can be used to determine whether the swap is expected to have a positive or negative value in the future. In Figure 7.9a the value of the swap is expected to become negative with the passage of time because the early positive-value exchanges will have been made. Similarly, in Figure 7.9b the value of the swap is expected to become positive with the passage of time because the early negative-value exchanges will have been made.[6]

# 7.8 FIXED-FOR-FIXED CURRENCY SWAPS

Another popular type of swap is a fixed-for-fixed currency swap. This involves exchanging principal and interest payments at a fixed rate in one currency for principal and interest payments at a fixed rate in another currency.

A currency swap agreement requires the principal to be specified in each of the two currencies. The principal amounts in each currency are usually exchanged at the beginning and at the end of the life of the swap. Usually the principal amounts are chosen to be approximately equivalent using the exchange rate at the swap's initiation. But when they are exchanged at the end of the life of the swap, their values may be quite different.

# Illustration

Consider a hypothetical five-year currency swap agreement between British Petroleum and Barclays entered into on February 1, 2022. We suppose that British Petroleum pays a fixed rate of interest of  $3\%$  in dollars to Barclays and receives a fixed rate of interest of

Figure 7.10 A currency swap.

4\% in British pounds (sterling) from Barclays. Interest rate payments are made once a year and the principal amounts are  $15 million and$ 10 million. This is termed a fixed-for-fixed currency swap because the interest rate in both currencies is fixed. The swap is shown in Figure 7.10. Initially, the principal amounts flow in the opposite direction to the arrows in Figure 7.10. The interest payments during the life of the swap and the final principal payment flow in the same direction as the arrows. Thus, at the outset of the swap, British Petroleum pays £10 million and receives $15 million. Each year during the life of the swap contract, British Petroleum receives £0.40 million (= 4\% of £10 million) and pays $0.45 million (= 3\% of $15 million). At the end of the life of the swap, it pays $15 million and receives £10 million. These cash flows are shown in Table 7.6. The cash flows to Barclays are the opposite to those shown.

# Use of a Currency Swap to Transform Liabilities and Assets

A swap such as the one just considered can be used to transform borrowings in one currency to borrowings in another currency. Suppose that British Petroleum can borrow  $10 million at 4\%$  interest. The swap has the effect of transforming this loan into one where it has borrowed 15 million at  $3\%$  interest. The initial exchange of principal converts the amount borrowed from sterling to dollars. The subsequent exchanges in the swap have the effect of swapping the interest and principal payments from sterling to dollars.

The swap can also be used to transform the nature of assets. Suppose that British Petroleum can invest 15 million to earn 3\% in U.S. dollars for the next five years, but feels that sterling will strengthen (or at least not depreciate) against the dollar and prefers a U.K.-denominated investment. The swap has the effect of transforming the U.S. investment into a \mathbf{£}10 million investment in the U.K. yielding 4\%.

# Comparative Advantage

Currency swaps can be motivated by comparative advantage. To illustrate this, we consider another hypothetical example. Suppose the five-year fixed-rate borrowing costs to General Electric and Qantas Airways in U.S. dollars (USD) and Australian dollars (AUD) are as shown in Table 7.7. The data in the table suggest that Australian rates are higher than U.S. interest rates. Also, General Electric is more creditworthy than Qantas Airways, because it is offered a more favorable rate of interest in both currencies. From the viewpoint of a swap trader, the interesting aspect of Table 7.7 is that the spreads between the rates paid by General Electric and Qantas Airways in the two markets are not the same. Qantas Airways pays  $2\%$  more than General Electric in the USD market and only  $0.4\%$  more than General Electric in the AUD market.

This situation is analogous to that in Table 7.5. General Electric has a comparative advantage in the USD market, whereas Qantas Airways has a comparative advantage in the AUD market. In Table 7.5, where a plain vanilla interest rate swap was considered, we argued that comparative advantages are largely illusory. Here we are comparing the rates offered in two different currencies, and it is more likely that the comparative advantages are genuine. One possible source of comparative advantage is tax. General Electric's position might be such that USD borrowings lead to lower taxes on its worldwide income than AUD borrowings. Qantas Airways' position might be the reverse. (Note that we assume that the interest rates in Table 7.7 have been adjusted to reflect these types of tax advantages.)

We suppose that General Electric wants to borrow 20 million AUD and Qantas Airways wants to borrow 15 million USD and that the current exchange rate (USD per AUD) is 0.7500. This creates a perfect situation for a currency swap. General Electric and Qantas Airways each borrow in the market where they have a comparative advantage; that is, General Electric borrows USD whereas Qantas Airways borrows AUD. They then use a currency swap to transform General Electric's loan into a AUD loan and Qantas Airways' loan into a USD loan.

As already mentioned, the difference between the dollar interest rates is  $2\%$ , whereas the difference between the AUD interest rates is  $0.4\%$ . By analogy with the interest rate swap case, we expect the total gain to all parties to be  $2.0 - 0.4 = 1.6\%$  per annum.

There are many ways in which the swap can be arranged. Figure 7.11 shows one way a swap might be brokered by a financial institution. General Electric borrows USD and Qantas Airways borrows AUD. The effect of the swap is to transform the USD interest rate of  $5\%$  per annum to an AUD interest rate of  $6.9\%$  per annum for General Electric. As a result, General Electric is  $0.7\%$  per annum better off than it would be if it went directly to AUD markets. Similarly, Qantas exchanges an AUD loan at  $8\%$  per annum for a USD loan at  $6.3\%$  per annum and ends up  $0.7\%$  per

Table 7.7 Borrowing rates providing basis for currency swap.

<table><tr><td></td><td>USD*</td><td>AUD*</td></tr><tr><td>General Electric</td><td>5.0\%</td><td>7.6\%</td></tr><tr><td>Qantas Airways</td><td>7.0\%</td><td>8.0\%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">*Quoted rates have been adjusted to reflect the differential impact of taxes.</td></tr></table> annum better off than it would be if it went directly to USD markets. The financial institution gains  $1.3\%$  per annum on its USD cash flows and loses  $1.1\%$  per annum on its AUD flows. If we ignore the difference between the two currencies, the financial institution makes a net gain of  $0.2\%$  per annum. As predicted, the total gain to all parties is  $1.6\%$  per annum.

Figure 7.13 Alternative arrangement for currency swap: General Electric bears some foreign exchange risk.


Each year the financial institution makes a gain of USD 195,000 ( $= 1.3\%$  of 15 million) and incurs a loss of AUD 220,000 ( $= 1.1\%$  of 20 million). The financial institution can avoid any foreign exchange risk by buying AUD 220,000 per annum in the forward market for each year of the life of the swap, thus locking in a net gain in USD.

It is possible to redesign the swap so that the financial institution does not need to hedge. Figures 7.12 and 7.13 present two alternatives. These alternatives are unlikely to be used in practice because they do not lead to General Electric and Qantas being free of foreign exchange risk. In Figure 7.12, Qantas bears some foreign exchange risk because it pays  $1.1\%$  per annum in AUD and pays  $5.2\%$  per annum in USD. In Figure 7.13, General Electric bears some foreign exchange risk because it receives  $1.1\%$  per annum in USD and pays  $8\%$  per annum in AUD.

# 7.9 VALUATION OF FIXED-FOR-FIXED CURRENCY SWAPS

Each exchange of payments in a fixed-for-fixed currency swap is a forward contract. As shown in Section 5.7, forward foreign exchange contracts can be valued by assuming that forward exchange rates are realized. A fixed-for-fixed currency swap can therefore be valued assuming that forward rates are realized.

# Example 7.2

Suppose that the term structure of risk-free interest rates is flat in both Japan and the United States. The Japanese rate is  $1.5\%$  per annum and the U.S. rate is  $2.5\%$  per annum (both with continuous compounding). A financial institution has entered into a currency swap in which it receives  $3\%$  per annum in yen and pays  $4\%$  per annum in dollars once a year. The principals in the two currencies are 10 million and 1,200 million yen. The swap will last for another three years, and the current exchange rate is 110 yen per dollar. The calculations for valuing the swap as the sum of forward foreign exchange contracts are summarized in the following table (all amounts are in millions):

<table><tr><td>Time (years)</td><td>Dollar cash flow</td><td>Yen cash flow</td><td>Forward exchange rate</td><td>Dollar value of yen cash flow</td><td>Net cash flow</td><td>Present value</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>-0.4</td><td>+36</td><td>0.009182</td><td>0.3306</td><td>-0.0694</td><td>-0.0677</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>-0.4</td><td>+36</td><td>0.009275</td><td>0.3339</td><td>-0.0661</td><td>-0.0629</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>-10.4</td><td>+1236</td><td>0.009368</td><td>11.5786</td><td>+1.1786</td><td>+1.0934</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>+0.9629</td></tr></table>

The financial institution pays 0.04 \times 10 = \0.4 million dollars and receives 1,200 \times 0.03 = 36 million yen each year. In addition, the dollar principal of \10 million is paid and the yen principal of 1,200 million is received at the end of year 3. The current spot rate is 1/110 = 0.009091 dollar per yen. In this case, r = 2.5\% and r_f = 1.5\% so that the one-year forward exchange rate is, from equation (5.9), 0.009091e^{(0.025 - 0.015)\times 1} = 0.009182. The two- and three-year forward exchange rates in the table are calculated similarly. The forward contracts underlying the swap can be valued by assuming that the forward exchange rates are realized. If the one-year forward exchange rate is realized, the value of yen cash flow in year 1 will be 36 \times 0.009182 = 0.3306 million dollars and the net cash flow at the end of year 1 will be 0.3306 - 0.4 = -0.0694 million dollars. This has a present value of -0.0694e^{-0.025\times 1} = -0.0677 million dollars. This is the value of the forward contract corresponding to the exchange of cash flows at the end of year 1. The value of the other forward contracts are calculated similarly. As shown in the table, the total value of the forward contracts is \0.9629 million.

The value of a currency swap is normally zero when it is first negotiated. If the two principals are worth exactly the same using the exchange rate at the start of the swap, the value of the swap is also zero immediately after the initial exchange of principal. However, as in the case of interest rate swaps, this does not mean that each of the individual forward contracts underlying the swap has zero value. It can be shown that when interest rates in two currencies are significantly different, the payer of the high-interest-rate currency is in the position where the forward contracts corresponding to the early exchanges of cash flows have negative values, and the forward contract corresponding to final exchange of principals has a positive value. The payer of the low-interest-rate currency is likely to be in the opposite position; that is, the early exchanges of cash flows have positive values and the final exchange has a negative value.


For the payer of the low-interest-rate currency, the swap will tend to have a negative value during most of its life. The forward contracts corresponding to the early exchanges of payments have positive values, and once these exchanges have taken place, there is a tendency for the remaining forward contracts to have, in total, a negative value. For the payer of the high-interest-rate currency, the reverse is true. The value of the swap will tend to be positive during most of its life. Results of this sort are important when the credit risk in bilaterally cleared transactions is considered.

# Valuation in Terms of Bond Prices

A fixed-for-fixed currency swap can also be valued in a straightforward way as the difference between two bonds. If we define  $V_{\mathrm{swap}}$  as the value in U.S. dollars of an outstanding swap where dollars are received and a foreign currency is paid, that is,

$$

V _ {\text {s w a p}} = B _ {D} - S _ {0} B _ {F}

$$ where  $B_{F}$  is the value, measured in the foreign currency, of the bond defined by the foreign cash flows on the swap and  $B_{D}$  is the value of the bond defined by the domestic cash flows on the swap, and  $S_{0}$  is the spot exchange rate (expressed as number of dollars per unit of foreign currency). The value of a swap can therefore be determined from the term structure of interest rates in the two currencies and the spot exchange rate.

Similarly, the value of a swap where the foreign currency is received and dollars are paid is

$$
V _ {\text {s w a p}} = S _ {0} B _ {F} - B _ {D}
$$

# Example 7.3

Consider again the situation in Example 7.2. The term structure of risk-free interest rates is flat in both Japan and the United States. The Japanese rate is  $1.5\%$  per annum and the U.S. rate is  $2.5\%$  per annum (both with continuous compounding). A financial institution has entered into a currency swap in which it receives  $3\%$  per annum in yen and pays  $4\%$  per annum in dollars once a year. The principals in the two currencies are  $10 million and 1,200 million yen. The swap will last for another three years, and the current exchange rate is 110 yen =$ 1. The calculations for valuing the swap in terms of bonds are summarized in the following table (all amounts are in millions):

<table><tr><td>Time (years)</td><td>Cash flows on dollar bond ($)</td><td>Present value ($)</td><td>Cash flows on yen bond (yen)</td><td>Present value (yen)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.3901</td><td>36</td><td>35.46</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.3805</td><td>36</td><td>34.94</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>10.4</td><td>9.6485</td><td>1,236</td><td>1,181.61</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>10.4191</td><td></td><td>1,252.01</td></tr></table>

The cash flows from the dollar bond underlying the swap are as shown in the second column. The present value of the cash flows using the dollar discount rate of  $2.5\%$  are shown in the third column. The cash flows from the yen bond underlying the swap are shown in the fourth column. The present value of the cash flows using the yen discount rate of  $1.5\%$  are shown in the final column of the table. The value of the dollar bond,  $B_{D}$ , is 10.4191 million dollars. The value of the yen bond is 1,252.01 million yen. The value of the swap in dollars is therefore  $(1,252.01 / 110) - 10.4191 = 0.9629$  million. This is in agreement with the calculation in Example 7.2.

# 7.10 OTHER CURRENCY SWAPS

Two other popular currency swaps are:

1. Fixed-for-floating where a floating interest rate in one currency is exchanged for a fixed interest rate in another currency
2. Floating-for-floating where a floating interest rate in one currency is exchanged for a floating interest rate in another currency.

An example of the first type of swap would be an exchange where a floating rate on a principal of £7 million is paid and  $3\%$  on a principal of $10 million is received with payments being made semiannually for 10 years. Similarly to a fixed-for-fixed currency swap, this would involve an initial exchange of principal in the opposite direction to the interest payments and a final exchange of principal in the same direction as the interest payments at the end of the swap's life. A fixed-for-floating swap can be regarded as a portfolio consisting of a fixed-for-fixed currency swap and a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap. For instance, the swap in our example can be regarded as (a) a swap where  $3\%$  on a principal of $10 million is received and (say)  $4\%$  on a principal of £7 million is paid plus (b) an interest rate swap where  $4\%$  is received and floating is paid on a notional principal of £7 million.

To value the swap we are considering we can calculate the value of the dollar payments in dollars by discounting them at the dollar risk-free rate. We can calculate the value of the sterling payments by assuming that floating forward rates will be realized and discounting the cash flows at the sterling risk-free rate. The value of the swap is the difference between the values of the two sets of payments using current exchange rates.

An example of the second type of swap would be the exchange where floating on a principal of £7 million is paid and floating on a principal of $10 million is received. As in the other cases we have considered, this would involve an initial exchange of principal in the opposite direction to the interest payments and a final exchange of principal in the same direction as the interest payments at the end of the swap's life. A floating-for-floating swap can be regarded as a portfolio consisting of a fixed-for-fixed currency swap and two interest rate swaps, one in each currency. For instance, the swap in our example can be regarded as (a) a swap where 3\% on a principal of $10 million is received and 4\% on a principal of £7 million is paid plus (b) an interest rate swap where 4\% is received and floating is paid on a notional principal of £7 million plus (c) an interest rate swap where 3\% is paid and floating is received on a notional principal of 10 million.

A floating-for-floating swap can be valued by assuming that forward interest rates in each currency will be realized and discounting the cash flows at risk-free rates. The value of the swap is the difference between the values of the two sets of payments using current exchange rates.

# 7.11 CREDIT RISK

When swaps and other derivatives are cleared through a central counterparty there is very little credit risk. As has been explained, standard swap transactions between a nonfinancial corporation and a derivatives dealer can be cleared bilaterally. Both sides are then potentially subject to credit risk. Consider the bilaterally cleared transaction between Intel and Citigroup in Figure 7.4. This would be netted with all other bilaterally cleared derivatives between Intel and Citigroup. If Intel defaults when the net value of the outstanding transactions to Citigroup is greater than the collateral (if any) posted by Intel, Citigroup will incur a loss. Similarly, if Citigroup defaults when the net value of the outstanding transactions to Intel is greater than the collateral (if any) posted by Citigroup, Intel will incur a loss.

It is important to distinguish between the credit risk and market risk to a financial institution in any contract. The credit risk arises from the possibility that a loss will be incurred because of a default by the counterparty. The market risk arises from the possibility that market variables such as interest rates, equity prices, and exchange rates will move in such a way that the value of a contract to the financial institution becomes negative. Market risks can be hedged by entering into offsetting contracts; credit risks are less easy to hedge.

One of the more bizarre stories in swap markets is outlined in Business Snapshot 7.2. It concerns a British Local Authority, Hammersmith and Fulham, and shows that, in addition to bearing market risk and credit risk, banks trading swaps also sometimes bear legal risk.

# 7.12 CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS

A swap which has grown in importance since the year 2000 is a credit default swap (CDS). This is a swap that allows companies to hedge credit risks in the same way that they have hedged market risks for many years. A CDS is like an insurance contract that pays off if a particular company or country defaults. The company or country is known as the reference entity. The buyer of credit protection pays an insurance premium, known as the CDS spread, to the seller of protection for the life of the contract or until the reference entity defaults. Suppose that the notional principal of the CDS is  $100 million and the CDS spread for a five-year deal is 120 basis points. The insurance premium would be 120 basis points applied to$ 100 million or 1.2 million per year. If the reference entity does not default during the five years, nothing is received in return for the insurance premiums. If reference entity does default and bonds issued by the reference entity are worth 40 cents per dollar of principal immediately after default, the

# Business Snapshot 7.2 The Hammersmith and Fulham Story

Between 1987 to 1989 the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham in Great Britain entered into about 600 interest rate swaps and related instruments with a total notional principal of about 6 billion pounds. The transactions appear to have been entered into for speculative rather than hedging purposes. The two employees of Hammersmith and Fulham that were responsible for the trades had only a sketchy understanding of the risks they were taking and how the products they were trading worked.

By 1989, because of movements in sterling interest rates, Hammersmith and Fulham had lost several hundred million pounds on the swaps. To the banks on the other side of the transactions, the swaps were worth several hundred million pounds. The banks were concerned about credit risk. They had entered into offsetting swaps to hedge their interest rate risks. If Hammersmith and Fulham defaulted they would still have to honor their obligations on the offsetting swaps and would take a huge loss.

What happened was something a little different from a default. Hammersmith and Fulham's auditor asked to have the transactions declared void because Hammersmith and Fulham did not have the authority to enter into the transactions. The British courts agreed. The case was appealed and went all the way to the House of Lords, then Britain's highest court. The final decision was that Hammersmith and Fulham did not have the authority to enter into the swaps, but that they ought to have the authority to do so in the future for risk management purposes. Needless to say, banks were furious that their contracts were overturned in this way by the courts.

seller of protection has to make a payment to the buyer of protection equal to $60 million. The idea here is that, if the buyer of protection owned a portfolio of bonds issued by the reference entity with a principal of $100 million, the insurance payoff would be sufficient to bring the value of the portfolio back up to 100 million.

Credit default swaps are discussed in more detail in Chapter 25.

# 7.13 OTHER TYPES OF SWAPS

Many other types of swaps are traded. We will discuss some of them in Chapter 34. At this stage we provide an overview.

# Variations on the Standard Interest Rate Swap

In fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps, the frequency of payments on the two sides can be different. For example, a three-month floating rate might be exchanged for a six-month fixed rate with the first being paid every three months and the second being paid every six months. Floating rates such as the commercial paper (CP) rate are occasionally used. Sometimes floating-for-floating interest rates swaps (known as basis swaps) are negotiated. For example, the three-month CP rate minus 10 basis points might be exchanged for an overnight reference rate with both being applied to the same principal. (This deal would allow a company to hedge its exposure when assets and liabilities are subject to different floating rates.)

The principal in a swap agreement can be varied throughout the term of the swap to meet the needs of a counterparty. In an amortizing swap, the principal reduces in a predetermined way. (This might be designed to correspond to the amortization schedule on a loan.) In a step-up swap, the principal increases in a predetermined way. (This might be designed to correspond to drawdowns on a loan agreement.) Forward swaps (sometimes referred to as deferred swaps) where the parties do not begin to exchange interest payments until some future date are also sometimes arranged. Sometimes swaps are negotiated where the principal to which the fixed payments are applied is different from the principal to which the floating payments are applied.

In a compounding swap, interest on one or both sides is compounded forward to the end of the life of the swap according to preagreed rules and there is only one payment date at the end of the life of the swap. In an accrual swap, the interest on one side of the swap accrues only when the floating reference rate is in a certain range.

# Quantos

Sometimes a rate observed in one currency is applied to a principal amount in another currency. One such deal would be where a U.S. floating rate is exchanged for a U.K. floating rate with both principals being applied to a principal of 10 million British pounds. This type of swap is referred to as a diff swap or a quanto.

# Equity Swaps

An equity swap is an agreement to exchange the total return (dividends and capital gains) realized on an equity index for either a fixed or a floating rate of interest. For example, the total return on the S&P 500 in successive six-month periods might be exchanged for  $3\%$  with both being applied to the same principal. Equity swaps can be used by portfolio managers to convert returns from a fixed or floating investment to the returns from investing in an equity index, and vice versa.

# Options

Sometimes there are options embedded in a swap agreement. For example, in an extendable swap, one party has the option to extend the life of the swap beyond the specified period. In a puttable swap, one party has the option to terminate the swap early. Options on swaps, or swaptions, are also available. These provide one party with the right at a future time to enter into a swap where a predetermined fixed rate is exchanged for floating.

# Commodity, Volatility, and Other Swaps

Commodity swaps are in essence a series of forward contracts on a commodity with different maturity dates and the same delivery prices. In a volatility swap, there are a series of time periods. At the end of each period, one side pays a preagreed volatility while the other side pays the historical volatility realized during the period. Both volatilities are multiplied by the same notional principal in calculating payments.

Swaps are limited only by the imagination of financial engineers and the desire of corporate treasurers and fund managers for exotic structures. In Chapter 34 we will describe the famous  $5/30$  swap entered into between Procter and Gamble and Bankers

Trust where payments depended in a complex way on the 30-day commercial paper rate, a 30-year Treasury bond price, and the yield on a 5-year Treasury bond.

# SUMMARY

The two most common types of swaps are interest rate swaps and currency swaps. In an interest rate swap, one party agrees to pay the other party interest at a fixed rate on a notional principal for a number of years. In return, it receives interest at a floating rate on the same notional principal for the same period of time. In a currency swap, one party agrees to pay interest on a principal amount in one currency. In return, it receives interest on a principal amount in another currency.

Principal amounts are not exchanged in an interest rate swap. In a currency swap, principal amounts are usually exchanged at both the beginning and the end of the life of the swap. For a party paying interest in the foreign currency, the foreign principal is received, and the domestic principal is paid at the beginning of the life of the swap. At the end of the life of the swap, the foreign principal is paid and the domestic principal is received.

An interest rate swap can be used to transform a floating-rate loan into a fixed-rate loan, or vice versa. It can also be used to transform a floating-rate investment to a fixed-rate investment, or vice versa. A currency swap can be used to transform a loan in one currency into a loan in another currency. It can also be used to transform an investment denominated in one currency into an investment denominated in another currency.

The interest rate and currency swaps considered in main part of the chapter can be regarded portfolios of forward contracts. They can be valued by assuming the forward interest rates and exchange rates observed in the market today will occur in the future.

# Practice Questions

7.11. Companies A and B have been offered the following rates per annum on a 20 million five-year loan:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Fixed rate</td><td>Floating rate</td></tr><tr><td>Company A</td><td>5.0\%</td><td>SOFR + 0.1\%</td></tr><tr><td>Company B</td><td>6.4\%</td><td>SOFR + 0.6\%</td></tr></table>

Company A requires a floating-rate loan; Company B requires a fixed-rate loan. Design a swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary,  $0.1\%$  per annum and that will appear equally attractive to both companies.

7.12. A $100 million interest rate swap has a remaining life of 10 months. Under the terms of the swap, six-month LIBOR is exchanged for  $4\%$  per annum (compounded semiannually). Six-month LIBOR forward rates for all maturities are  $3\%$  (with semiannual compounding). The six-month LIBOR rate was  $2.4\%$  two months ago. OIS rates for all maturities are  $2.7\%$  with continuous compounding. What is the current value of the swap to the party paying floating? What is the value to the party paying fixed?
7.13. Company X wishes to borrow U.S. dollars at a fixed rate of interest. Company Y wishes to borrow Japanese yen at a fixed rate of interest. The amounts required by the two companies are roughly the same at the current exchange rate. The companies have been quoted the following interest rates, which have been adjusted for the impact of taxes:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Yen</td><td>Dollars</td></tr><tr><td>Company X</td><td>5.0\%</td><td>9.6\%</td></tr><tr><td>Company Y</td><td>6.5\%</td><td>10.0\%</td></tr></table>

Design a swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary, 50 basis points per annum. Make the swap equally attractive to the two companies and ensure that all foreign exchange risk is assumed by the bank.

7.14. A currency swap has a remaining life of 15 months. It involves exchanging interest at  $10\%$  on  $\pm 20$  million for interest at  $6\%$  on  $\$30$  million once a year. The term structure of risk-free interest rates in the United Kingdom is flat at  $7\%$  and the term structure of risk-free interest rates in the United States is flat at  $4\%$  (both with annual compounding). The current exchange rate (dollars per pound sterling) is 1.5500. What is the value of the swap to the party paying sterling? What is the value of the swap to the party paying dollars?
7.15. Explain the difference between the credit risk and the market risk in a swap.
7.16. A corporate treasurer tells you that he has just negotiated a five-year loan at a competitive fixed rate of interest of  $5.2\%$ . The treasurer explains that he achieved the  $5.2\%$  rate by borrowing at a six-month floating reference rate plus 150 basis points and swapping the floating reference rate for  $3.7\%$ . He goes on to say that this was possible because his company has a comparative advantage in the floating-rate market. What has the treasurer overlooked?
7.17. A bank enters into an interest rate swap with a nonfinancial counterparty using bilaterally clearing where it is paying a fixed rate of  $3\%$  and receiving floating. No collateral is posted and no other transactions are outstanding between the bank and the counterparty. What credit risk is the bank subject to? Discuss whether the credit risk is greater when the yield curve is upward sloping or when it is downward sloping.
7.18. Companies X and Y have been offered the following rates per annum on a 5 million 10-year investment:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Fixed rate</td><td>Floating rate</td></tr><tr><td>Company X</td><td>8.0\%</td><td>LIBOR</td></tr><tr><td>Company Y</td><td>8.8\%</td><td>LIBOR</td></tr></table>

Company X requires a fixed-rate investment; company Y requires a floating-rate investment. Design a swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary,  $0.2\%$  per annum and will appear equally attractive to X and Y.

7.19. A financial institution has entered into an interest rate swap with company X. Under the terms of the swap, it receives  $4\%$  per annum and pays six-month LIBOR on a principal of $10 million for five years. Payments are made every six months. Suppose that company X defaults on the sixth payment date (end of year 3) when six-month forward LIBOR rates for all maturities are  $2\%$  per annum. What is the loss to the financial institution? Assume that six-month LIBOR was  $3\%$  per annum halfway through year 3 and that at the time of the default all OIS rates are  $1.8\%$  per annum. OIS rates are expressed with continuous compounding; other rates are expressed with semiannual compounding.
7.20. A financial institution has entered into a 10-year currency swap with company Y. Under the terms of the swap, the financial institution receives interest at  $3\%$  per annum in Swiss francs and pays interest at  $8\%$  per annum in U.S. dollars. Interest payments are exchanged once a year. The principal amounts are 7 million dollars and 10 million francs. Suppose that company Y declares bankruptcy at the end of year 6, when the exchange rate is $0.80 per franc. What is the cost to the financial institution? Assume that, at the end of year 6, risk-free interest rates are  $3\%$  per annum in Swiss francs and  $8\%$  per annum in U.S. dollars for all maturities. All interest rates are quoted with annual compounding.

7.21. Companies A and B face the following interest rates (adjusted for the differential impact of taxes):

<table><tr><td></td><td>Company A</td><td>Company B</td></tr><tr><td>U.S. dollars</td><td>Floating + 0.5\%</td><td>Floating + 1.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>Canadian dollars</td><td>5.0\%</td><td>6.5\%</td></tr></table>

Assume that A wants to borrow U.S. dollars at a floating rate of interest and B wants to borrow Canadian dollars at a fixed rate of interest. A financial institution is planning to arrange a swap and requires a 50-basis-point spread. If the swap is equally attractive to A and B, what rates of interest will A and B end up paying?

7.22. After it hedges its foreign exchange risk using forward contracts, is the financial institution's average spread in Figure 7.11 likely to be greater than or less than 20 basis points? Explain your answer.
7.23. "Nonfinancial companies with high credit risks are the ones that cannot access fixed-rate markets directly. They are the companies that are most likely to be paying fixed and receiving floating in an interest rate swap." Assume that this statement is true. Do you think it increases or decreases the risk of a financial institution's swap portfolio? Assume that companies are most likely to default when interest rates are high.
7.24. Why is the expected loss to a bank from a default on a swap with a counterparty less than the expected loss from the default on a loan to the counterparty when the loan and swap have the same principal? Assume that there are no other derivatives transactions between the bank and the counterparty, that the swap is cleared bilaterally, and that no collateral is provided by the counterparty in the case of either the swap or the loan.
7.25. A bank finds that its assets are not matched with its liabilities. It is taking floating-rate deposits and making fixed-rate loans. How can swaps be used to offset the risk?
7.26. Explain how you would value a swap that is the exchange of a floating rate in one currency for a fixed rate in another currency.
7.27. Is rates are  $3.4\%$  for all maturities. What is the value of an Is swap with two years to maturity where  $3\%$  is received and the floating reference rate is paid. Assume annual compounding, annual payments, and 100 million principal.
7.28. A financial institution has entered into a swap where it agreed to make quarterly payments at a rate of  $3\%$  per annum and receive the SOFR three-month reference rate on a notional principal of $100 million. The swap now has a remaining life of 7.5 months. Assume the risk-free rates with continuous compounding (calculated from SOFR) for 1.5, 4.5, and 7.5 months are  $2.8\%$ ,  $3.0\%$ , and  $3.1\%$ , respectively. Assume also that the continuously compounded risk-free rate observed for the last 1.5 months is  $2.7\%$ . Estimate the value of the swap.
7.29. (a) Company A has been offered the swap quotes in Table 7.4. It can borrow for three years at  $3.45\%$ . What floating rate can it swap this fixed rate into? (b) Company B has been offered the swap quotes in Table 7.4. It can borrow for five years at floating plus 75 basis points. What fixed rate can it swap this rate into? (c) Explain the rollover risks that Company B is taking.
7.30. The one-year LIBOR rates is  $3\%$ , and the LIBOR forward rate for the 1to 2-year period is  $3.2\%$ . The three-year swap rate for a swap with annual payments is  $3.2\%$ . What is the LIBOR forward rate for the 2to 3-year period if OIS zero rates for maturities of one, two, and three years are  $2.5\%$ ,  $2.7\%$ , and  $2.9\%$ , respectively. What is the value of a three-year swap where  $4\%$  is received and LIBOR is paid on a principal of 100 million. All rates are annually compounded.

7.31. A financial institution has entered into a swap where it agreed to receive quarterly payments at a rate of  $2\%$  per annum and pay the SOFR three-month reference rate on a notional principal of $100 million. The swap now has a remaining life of 10 months. Assume the risk-free rates with continuous compounding (calculated from SOFR) for 1 month, 4 months, 7 months, and 10 months are  $1.4\%$ ,  $1.6\%$ ,  $1.7\%$ , and  $1.8\%$ , respectively. Assume also that the continuously compounded risk-free rate observed for the last two months is  $1.1\%$ . Estimate the value of the swap.

7.32. Company A, a British manufacturer, wishes to borrow U.S. dollars at a fixed rate of interest. Company B, a U.S. multinational, wishes to borrow sterling at a fixed rate of interest. They have been quoted the following rates per annum:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Sterling</td><td>U.S. Dollars</td></tr><tr><td>Company A</td><td>11.0\%</td><td>7.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>Company B</td><td>10.6\%</td><td>6.2\%</td></tr></table>

(Rates have been adjusted for differential tax effects.) Design a swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary, 10 basis points per annum and that will produce a gain of 15 basis points per annum for each of the two companies.

7.33. The five-year swap rate when cash flows are exchanged semiannually is  $4\%$ . A company wants a swap where it receives payments at  $4.2\%$  per annum on a notional principal of $10 million.

# Securitization and the Financial Crisis of 2007-8

Derivatives such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options are concerned with transferring risk from one entity in the economy to another. The first seven chapters of this book have focused on forwards, futures, and swaps. Before moving on to discuss options, we consider another important way of transferring risk in the economy: securitization.

Securitization is of particular interest because of its role in the financial crisis that started in 2007. The crisis had its origins in financial products created from mortgages in the United States, but rapidly spread from the United States to other countries and from financial markets to the real economy. Some financial institutions failed; others had to be rescued by national governments. There can be no question that the first decade of the twenty-first century was disastrous for the financial sector.

In this chapter, we examine the nature of securitization and its role in the crisis. In the course of the chapter, we will learn about the U.S. mortgage market, asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, waterfalls, and the importance of incentives in financial markets.

# 8.1 SECURITIZATION

Traditionally, banks have funded their loans primarily from deposits. In the 1960s, U.S. banks found that they could not keep pace with the demand for residential mortgages with this type of funding. This led to the development of the mortgage-backed security (MBS) market. Organizations that were active in this market are:

- The Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, also known as Ginnie Mae)
- The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, also known as Fannie Mae)
- The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, also known as Freddie Mac).

These organizations bought portfolios of mortgages from the originating banks and packaged them as securities that were sold to investors. They guaranteed (for a fee) the interest and principal payments on the mortgages.

Thus, although banks originated the mortgages, they did not keep them on their balance sheets. Securitization allowed them to increase their lending faster than their deposits were growing. The guarantees provided by GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC protected MBS investors against defaults by borrowers.

In the 1980s, the securitization techniques developed for the mortgage market were applied to asset classes such as automobile loans and credit card receivables in the United States. Securitization also become popular in other parts of the world. As the securitization market developed, investors became comfortable with situations where they did not have a guarantee against defaults by borrowers.

# ABSs

A securitization arrangement of the type used during the 2000 to 2007 period (with no guarantees against default) is shown in Figure 8.1. This is known as an asset-backed security or ABS. A portfolio of income-producing assets such as loans is sold by the originating banks to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and the cash flows from the assets are then allocated to tranches. Figure 8.1 is simpler than the structures that were typically created because it has only three tranches (in practice, many more tranches were used). These are the senior tranche, the mezzanine tranche, and the equity tranche.

The portfolio in Figure 8.1 has a principal of  $100 million. This is divided as follows:$ 80 million to the senior tranche, $15 million to the mezzanine tranche, and $5 million to the equity tranche. The senior tranche's return is LIBOR plus 60 basis points, the mezzanine tranche's return is LIBOR plus 250 basis points, and the equity tranche's return is LIBOR plus 2,000 basis points.

Figure 8.2 The waterfall in an asset-backed security.

It sounds as though the equity tranche has the best deal, but this is not necessarily the case. The payments of interest and principal are not guaranteed. The return is like the yield on a bond. It is the return that will be realized if there are no defaults affecting the tranche. As we will see, the equity tranche is more likely to lose part of its principal, and less likely to receive the promised interest payments on its outstanding principal, than the other tranches.

Cash flows are allocated to tranches by specifying what is known as a waterfall. The general way a waterfall works is illustrated in Figure 8.2. A separate waterfall is applied to principal and interest payments. Principal payments are allocated to the senior tranche until its principal has been fully repaid. They are then allocated to mezzanine tranche until its principal has been fully repaid. Only after this has happened do principal repayments go to the equity tranche. Interest payments are allocated to the senior tranche until the senior tranche has received its promised return on its outstanding principal. Assuming that this promised return can be made, interest payments are then allocated to the mezzanine tranche. If the promised return to the mezzanine tranche can be made and cash flows are left over, they are allocated to pay interest on the equity tranche.

The extent to which the tranches get their principal back depends on losses on the underlying assets. The effect of the waterfall is roughly as follows. The first  $5\%$  of losses are borne by the equity tranche. If losses exceed  $5\%$ , the equity tranche loses all its principal and some losses are borne by the principal of the mezzanine tranche. If losses exceed  $20\%$ , the mezzanine tranche loses all its principal and some losses are borne by the principal of the senior tranche.

There are therefore two ways of looking at an ABS. One is with reference to the waterfall in Figure 8.2. Cash flows go first to the senior tranche, then to the mezzanine tranche, and then to the equity tranche. The other is in terms of losses. Losses of principal are first borne by the equity tranche, then by the mezzanine tranche, and then by the senior tranche. Rating agencies such as Moody's, S&P, and Fitch played a key role in securitization. The ABS in Figure 8.1 is likely to be designed so that the senior tranche is given the highest possible rating, AAA. The mezzanine tranche is typically rated BBB (well below AAA, but still investment grade). The equity tranche is typically unrated.

The description of ABSs that we have given so far is somewhat simplified. Typically, more than three tranches with a wide range of ratings were created. In the waterfall rules, as we have described them, the allocation of cash flows to tranches is sequential in that they always flow first to the most senior tranche, then to the next most senior tranche, and so on. In practice, the rules are somewhat more complicated than this and are described in a legal document that is several hundred pages long. Another complication is that there was often some overcollateralization where the total principal of the tranches was less than the total principal of the underlying assets. Also, the weighted average return promised to the tranches was less than the weighted average return payable on the assets.[2]

# ABS CDOs

Finding investors to buy the senior AAA-rated tranches of ABSs was usually not difficult, because the tranches promised returns that were very attractive when compared with the return on AAA-rated bonds. Equity tranches were typically retained by the originator of the assets or sold to a hedge fund.

Finding investors for mezzanine tranches was more difficult. This led to the creation of ABSs of ABSs. The way this was done is shown in Figure 8.3. Many different mezzanine tranches, created in the way indicated in Figure 8.1, are put in a portfolio and the risks associated with the cash flows from the portfolio are tranched out in the same way as the risks associated with cash flows from the assets are tranched out in Figure 8.1. The resulting structure is known as an ABS CDO or Mezz ABS CDO. (CDO is short for collateralized debt obligation.) In the example in Figure 8.3, the senior tranche of the ABS CDO accounts for  $65\%$  of the principal of the ABS mezzanine tranches, the mezzanine tranche of the ABS CDO accounts for  $25\%$  of the principal, and the equity tranche accounts for the remaining  $10\%$  of the principal. The structure is designed so that the senior tranche of the ABS CDO is given the highest credit rating of AAA. This means that the total of the AAA-rated instruments created in the example that is considered here is about  $90\%$  ( $80\%$  plus  $65\%$  of  $15\%$ ) of the principal of the underlying portfolios. This seems high but, if the securitization were carried further with an ABS being created from branches of ABS CDOs (and this did happen), the percentage would be pushed even higher.

In the example in Figure 8.3, the AAA-rated tranche of the ABS can expect to receive its promised return and get its principal back if losses on the underlying portfolio of assets is less than  $20\%$  because all losses of principal would then be absorbed by the more junior tranches. The AAA-rated tranche of the ABS CDO in Figure 8.3 is more risky. It will receive the promised return and get its principal back if losses on the underlying assets are  $10.25\%$  or less. This is because a loss of  $10.25\%$  means that mezzanine tranches of ABSs have to absorb losses equal to  $5.25\%$  of the ABS principal. As these tranches have a total principal equal to  $15\%$  of the ABS principal, they lose  $5.25/15$  or  $35\%$  of their principal. The equity and mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDO are then wiped out, but the senior tranche just manages to survive intact.

The senior tranche of the ABS CDO suffers losses if losses on the underlying portfolios are more than  $10.25\%$ . Consider, for example, the situation where losses are  $17\%$  on the underlying portfolios. Of the  $17\%$ ,  $5\%$  is borne by the equity tranche of the ABS and  $12\%$  by the mezzanine tranche of the ABS. Losses on the mezzanine tranches are therefore  $12/15$  or  $80\%$  of their principal. The first  $35\%$  is absorbed by the equity and mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDO. The senior tranche of the ABS CDO therefore loses  $45/65$  or  $69.2\%$  of its value. These and other results are summarized in Table 8.1. Our calculations assume that all ABS portfolios have the same default rate.

# 8.2 THE U.S. HOUSING MARKET

Figure 8.4 gives the S&P/Case-Shiller composite-10 index for house prices in the United States between January 1987 and February 2020. This tracks house prices for ten metropolitan areas of the United States. It shows that, in about the year 2000, house prices started to rise much faster than they had in the previous decade. The very low level of interest rates between 2002 and 2005 was an important contributory factor, but the bubble in house prices was also fueled by mortgage-lending practices.

The 2000 to 2006 period was characterized by a huge increase in what is termed subprime mortgage lending. Subprime mortgages are mortgages that are considered to be significantly more risky than average. Before 2000, most mortgages classified as subprime were second mortgages. After 2000, this changed as financial institutions became more comfortable with the notion of a subprime first mortgage.

# The Relaxation of Lending Standards

The relaxation of lending standards and the growth of subprime mortgages made house purchase possible for many families that had previously been considered to be not sufficiently creditworthy to qualify for a mortgage. These families increased the demand for real estate and prices rose. To mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders, it was attractive to make more loans, particularly when higher house prices resulted. More lending meant bigger profits. Higher house prices meant that the lending was well covered by the underlying collateral. If the borrower defaulted, it was less likely that the resulting foreclosure would lead to a loss.

Mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders naturally wanted to keep increasing their profits. Their problem was that, as house prices rose, it was more difficult for first-time buyers to afford a house. In order to continue to attract new entrants to the housing market, they had to find ways to relax their lending standards even more—and this is exactly what they did. The amount lent as a percentage of the house price increased. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMS) were developed where there was a low "teaser" rate of interest that would last for two or three years and be followed by a rate that was much higher.[3] A typical teaser rate was about  $6\%$  and the interest rate after the end of the teaser rate period was typically six-month LIBOR plus  $6\%$ .[4] However, teaser rates as low as  $1\%$  or  $2\%$  have been reported. Lenders also became more cavalier in the way they reviewed mortgage applications. Indeed, the applicant's income and other information reported on the application form were frequently not checked.

# Subprime Mortgage Securitization

Subprime mortgages were frequently securitized in the way indicated in Figures 8.1 to 8.3. The investors in tranches created from subprime mortgages usually had no guarantees that interest and principal would be paid. Securitization played a part in the crisis. The behavior of mortgage originators was influenced by their knowledge that mortgages would be securitized.5 When considering new mortgage applications, the question was not "Is this a credit risk we want to assume?" Instead it was "Is this a mortgage we can make money on by selling it to someone else?"

When a portfolio of mortgages was securitized, the buyers of the products that were created felt they had enough information if they knew, for each mortgage in the portfolio, the loan-to-value ratio (i.e., the ratio of the size of the loan to the assessed value of the house) and the borrower's FICO score. Other information on the mortgage application forms was considered irrelevant and, as already mentioned, was often not even checked by lenders. The most important thing for the lender was whether the mortgage could be sold to others—and this depended largely on the loan-to-value ratio and the applicant's FICO score.

It is interesting to note in passing that both the loan-to-value ratio and the FICO score were of doubtful quality. The property assessors who determined the value of a house at the time of a mortgage application sometimes succumbed to pressure from the lenders to come up with high values. Potential borrowers were sometimes counseled to take certain actions that would improve their FICO scores.[7]

Why was the government not regulating the behavior of mortgage lenders? The answer is that the U.S. government had since the 1990s been trying to expand home ownership and had been applying pressure to mortgage lenders to increase loans to lowand moderate-income people. Some state legislators, such as those in Ohio and Georgia, were concerned about what was going on and wanted to curtail predatory lending.[8] However, the courts decided that national standards should prevail.

A number of terms have been used to describe mortgage lending during the period leading up to the 2007-8 crisis. One is "liar loans" because individuals applying for a mortgage, knowing that no checks would be carried out, sometimes chose to lie on the application form. Another term used to describe some borrowers is "NINJA" (no income, no job, no assets).

# The Bubble Bursts

All bubbles burst eventually and this one was no exception. In 2007, many mortgage holders found they could no longer afford their mortgages when the teaser rates ended. This led to foreclosures and large numbers of houses coming on the market, which in turn led to a decline in house prices. Other mortgage holders, who had borrowed  $100\%$ , or close to  $100\%$ , of the cost of a house found that they had negative equity.

One of the features of the U.S. housing market is that mortgages are nonrecourse in many states. This means that, when there is a default, the lender is able to take possession of the house, but other assets of the borrower are off-limits. Consequently, the borrower has a free American-style put option. He or she can at any time sell the house to the lender for the principal outstanding on the mortgage. This feature encouraged speculative activity and was partly responsible for the bubble. Market participants realized belatedly how costly and destabilizing the put option could be. If the borrower had negative equity, the optimal decision was to exchange the house for the outstanding principal on the mortgage. The house was then sold by the lender, adding to the downward pressure on house prices.

It would be a mistake to assume that all mortgage defaulters were in the same position. Some were unable to meet mortgage payments and suffered greatly when they had to give up their homes. But many of the defaulters were speculators who bought multiple homes as rental properties and chose to exercise their put options. It was their tenants who suffered. There are also reports that some house owners (who were not speculators) were quite creative in extracting value from their put options. After handing the keys to their houses to the lender, they turned around and bought (sometimes at a bargain price) other houses that were in foreclosure. Imagine two people owning identical houses next to each other. Both have mortgages of  $250,000. Both houses are worth$ 200,000 and in foreclosure can be expected to sell for 170,000. What is the owners' optimal strategy? The answer is that each person should exercise the put option and buy the neighbor's house.

The United States was not alone in having declining real estate prices. Prices declined in many other countries as well. Real estate prices in the United Kingdom were particularly badly affected. As Figure 8.4 indicates, average house prices in the United States did recover after 2012.

# The Losses

As foreclosures increased, the losses on mortgages also increased. It might be thought that a  $35\%$  reduction in house prices would lead to at most a  $35\%$  loss of principal on defaulting mortgages. In fact, the losses were far greater than that. Houses in foreclosure were often in poor condition and sold for a small fraction of their value prior to the financial crisis. In 2008 and 2009, losses as high  $75\%$  of the mortgage principal were reported for mortgages on houses in foreclosure in some cases.

Investors in tranches that were formed from the mortgages incurred big losses. The value of the ABS tranches created from subprime mortgages was monitored by a series of indices known as ABX. These indices indicated that the tranches originally rated BBB had lost about  $80\%$  of their value by the end of 2007 and about  $97\%$  of their value by mid-2009. The value of the ABS CDO tranches created from BBB tranches was monitored by a series of indices known as TABX. These indices indicated that the tranches originally rated AAA lost about  $80\%$  of their value by the end of 2007 and were essentially worthless by mid-2009.

Financial institutions such as UBS, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup had big positions in some of the tranches and incurred huge losses, as did the insurance giant AIG, which provided protection against losses on ABS CDO tranches that had originally been rated AAA. Many financial institutions had to be rescued with government funds. There have been few worse years in financial history than 2008. Bear Stearns was taken over by JP Morgan Chase; Merrill Lynch was taken over by Bank of America; Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which had formerly been investment banks, became bank holding companies with both commercial and investment banking interests; and Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail (see Business Snapshot 1.1).

# Credit Spreads

The losses on securities backed by residential mortgages led to a severe financial crisis. In 2006, banks were reasonably well capitalized, loans were relatively easy to obtain, and credit spreads (the excess of the interest rate on a loan over the risk-free interest rate) were low. By 2008, the situation was totally different. The capital of banks had been badly eroded by their losses. They had become much more risk-averse and were reluctant to lend. Creditworthy individuals and corporations found borrowing difficult. Credit spreads had increased dramatically. The world experienced its worst recession in several generations. The three-month LIBOR-OIS spread briefly reached 364 basis points in October 2008, indicating an extreme reluctance of banks to lend to each other for longer periods than overnight. Another measure of the stress in financial markets is the TED spread. This is the excess of the three-month Eurodollar deposit rate over the three-month Treasury interest. In normal market conditions, it is 30 to 50 basis points. It reached over 450 basis points in October 2008.

# 8.3 WHAT WENT WRONG?

"Irrational exuberance" is a phrase coined by Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to describe the behavior of investors during the bull market of the 1990s. It can also be applied to the period leading up to the financial crisis. Mortgage lenders, the investors in tranches of ABSs and ABS CDOs that were created from residential mortgages, and the companies that sold protection on the tranches assumed that the good times would last for ever. They thought that U.S. house prices would continue to increase. There might be declines in one or two areas, but the possibility of the widespread decline shown in Figure 8.4 was a scenario not considered by most people.

Many factors contributed to the crisis that started in 2007. Mortgage originators used lax lending standards. Products were developed to enable mortgage originators to profitably transfer credit risk to investors. Rating agencies moved from their traditional business of rating bonds, where they had a great deal of experience, to rating structured products, which were relatively new and for which there were relatively little historical data. The products bought by investors were complex and in many instances investors and rating agencies had inaccurate or incomplete information about the quality of the underlying assets. Investors in the structured products that were created thought they had found a money machine and chose to rely on rating agencies rather than forming their own opinions about the underlying risks. The return offered by the products rated AAA was high compared with the returns on bonds rated AAA.

Structured products such as those in Figures 8.1 and 8.3 are highly dependent on the default correlation between the underlying assets. Default correlation measures the tendency for different borrowers to default at about the same time. If the default correlation between the underlying assets in Figure 8.1 is low, the AAA-rated tranches are very unlikely to experience losses. As this default correlation increases, they become more vulnerable. The tranches of ABS CDOs in Figure 8.3 are even more heavily dependent on default correlation.

If mortgages exhibit moderate default correlation (as they do in normal times), there is very little chance of a high overall default rate and the AAA-rated tranches of both ABSs and ABS CDOs that are created from mortgages are fairly safe. However, as many investors found to their cost, default correlations tend to increase in stressed market conditions. This makes very high default rates possible.

There was a tendency to assume that a tranche with a particular rating could be equated to a bond with the that rating. The rating agencies published the criteria they used for rating tranches. S&P and Fitch rated a tranche so as to ensure that the probability of the tranche experiencing a loss was the same as the probability of a similarly rated bond experiencing a loss. Moody's rated a tranche so that the expected loss from the tranche was the same as the expected loss from a similarly rated bond. The procedures used by rating agencies were therefore designed to ensure that one aspect of the loss distributions of tranches and bonds were matched. However, other aspects of the distributions were liable to be quite different.

The differences between tranches and bonds were accentuated by the fact tranches were often quite thin. The AAA tranches often accounted for about  $80\%$  of the principal as in Figure 8.1, but it was not unusual for there to be 15 to 20 other tranches. Each of these tranches would be  $1\%$  or  $2\%$  wide. Such thin tranches are likely to either incur no losses or be totally wiped out. The chance of investors recovering part of their principal (as bondholders usually do) is small. Consider, for example, a BBB tranche that is responsible for losses in the range  $5\%$  to  $6\%$ , If losses on the underlying portfolio are less than  $5\%$ , the tranche is safe. If losses are greater than  $6\%$ , the tranche is wiped out. Only in the case where losses are between  $5\%$  and  $6\%$  is a partial recovery made by investors.

The difference between a thin BBB-rated tranche and a BBB-rated bond was overlooked by many investors. The difference makes the tranches of ABS CDOs created from the BBB-rated tranches of ABSs much riskier than tranches created in a similar way from BBB bonds. Losses on a portfolio of BBB bonds can reasonably be assumed to be unlikely to exceed  $25\%$  in even the most severe market conditions. Table 8.1 shows that  $100\%$  losses on a portfolio of BBB tranches can occur relatively easily—and this is even more true when the tranches are only  $1\%$  or  $2\%$  wide.

# Regulatory Arbitrage

Many of the mortgages were originated by banks and it was banks that were the main investors in the tranches that were created from the mortgages. Why would banks choose to securitize mortgages and then buy the securitized products that were created? The answer concerns what is termed regulatory arbitrage. The regulatory capital banks were required to keep for the tranches created from a portfolio of mortgages was much less than the regulatory capital that would be required for the mortgages themselves.

# Incentives

One of the lessons from the crisis is the importance of incentives. Economists use the term "agency costs" to describe the situation where incentives are such that the interests of two parties in a business relationship are not perfectly aligned. The process by which mortgages were originated, securitized, and sold to investors was unfortunately riddled with agency costs.

The incentive of the originators of mortgages was to make loans that would be acceptable to the creators of the ABS and ABS CDO tranches. The incentive of the individuals who valued the houses on which the mortgages were written was to please the lender by providing as high a valuation as possible so that the loan-to-value ratio was as low as possible. (Pleasing the lender was likely to lead to more business from that lender.) The main concern of the creators of tranches was how the tranches would be rated. They wanted the volume of AAA-rated tranches that they created to be as high as possible and found ways of using the published criteria of rating agencies to achieve this. The rating agencies were paid by the issuers of the securities they rated and about half their income came from structured products.

Another source of agency costs concerns the incentives of the employees of financial institutions. Employee compensation falls into three categories: regular salary, the end-of-year bonus, and stock or stock options. Many employees at all levels of seniority in financial institutions, particularly traders, receive much of their compensation in the form of end-of-year bonuses. This form of compensation is focused on short-term performance. If an employee generates huge profits one year and is responsible for severe losses the next, the employee will often receive a big bonus the first year and will not have to return it the following year. (The employee might lose his or her job as a result of the second year losses, but even that is not a disaster. Financial institutions seem to be surprisingly willing to recruit individuals with losses on their résumés.)

Imagine you are an employee of a financial institution in 2006 responsible for investing in ABS CDOs created from mortgages. Almost certainly you would have recognized that there was a bubble in the U.S. housing market and would expect that bubble to burst sooner or later. However, it is possible that you would decide to continue with your ABS CDO investments. If the bubble did not burst until after the end of 2006, you would still get a nice bonus at the end of 2006.

# 8.4 THE AFTERMATH

Prior to the crisis, over-the-counter derivatives markets were largely unregulated. This has changed. As mentioned in earlier chapters, there is now a requirement that most standardized over-the-counter derivatives be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). This means that they are treated similarly to derivatives such as futures that trade on exchanges. Banks are usually members of one or more CCPs. When trading standardized derivatives, they are required to post initial margin and variation margin with the CCP and are also required to contribute to a default fund. For transactions between financial institutions that continue to be cleared bilaterally, collateral arrangements are now regulated rather than chosen by the parties involved.

The bonuses paid by banks have come under more scrutiny and in some jurisdictions there are limits on the size of the bonuses that can be paid. The way bonuses are paid is changing. Before the crisis it was common for a trader's bonus for a year to be paid in full at the end of the year with no possibility of the bonus having to be returned. It is now more common for this bonus to be spread over several years so that part of the bonus can be clawed back if results are not as good as expected.

# Business Snapshot 8.1 The Basel Committee

As the activities of banks became more global in the 1980s, it became necessary for regulators in different countries to work together to determine an international regulatory framework. As a result the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed. In 1988, it published a set of rules for the capital banks were required to keep for credit risk. These capital requirements have become known as Basel I. They were modified to accommodate the netting of transactions in 1995. In 1996 a new capital requirement for market risk was published. This capital requirement was implemented in 1998. In 1999 significant changes were proposed for the calculation of the capital requirements for credit risk and a capital requirement for operational risk was introduced. These rules are referred to as Basel II. Basel II is considerably more complicated than Basel I and its implementation was delayed until 2007 (later in some countries). During the financial crisis and afterwards, the Basel committee introduced new regulatory requirements known as Basel II.5, which increased capital for market risk. This was followed by Basel III, which tightened capital requirements and introduced liquidity requirements. Basel IV, which will be implemented between 2022 and 2027, revises Basel III, placing more emphasis on standardized approaches developed by the Basel committee for determining capital requirements.

The Dodd-Frank Act in the United States and similar legislation in the United Kingdom and European Union provide for more oversight of financial institutions and include much new legislation affecting financial institutions. For example, in the United States proprietary trading and other similar activities of deposit-taking institutions are being restricted. (This is known as the "Volcker rule" because it was proposed by former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker.) An independent committee in the United Kingdom chaired by Sir John Vickers has proposed that the retail operations of banks be ring-fenced. The Liikanen committee in the European Union similarly recommends that proprietary trading and other high-risk activities be separated from other banking activities.

Banks throughout the world are regulated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. $^{10}$  Prior to the crisis, the committee implemented regulations known as Basel I and Basel II. These are summarized in Business Snapshot 8.1. Following the crisis, it has implemented what is known as "Basel II.5." This increases the capital requirements for market risk. Basel III was published in 2010 has been implemented over a period lasting until 2019. It increases the amount of capital and quality of capital that banks are required to keep. It also requires banks to satisfy certain liquidity requirements. As discussed in Business Snapshot 4.2, one cause of problems during the crisis was the tendency of banks to place too much reliance on the use of short-term liabilities for long-term funding needs. The liquidity requirements are designed to make it more difficult for them to do this. Basel IV, to be implemented between 2022 and 2027, revises some of the rules in Basel III and reduces the extent to which banks can use their own internal models to determine their capital requirements.

# SUMMARY

Securitization is a process used by banks to create securities from loans and other income-producing assets. The securities are sold to investors. This removes the loans from the banks' balance sheets and enables the banks to expand their lending faster than would otherwise be possible. The first loans to be securitized were mortgages in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. Investors who bought the mortgage-backed securities were not exposed to the risk of borrowers defaulting because the loans were backed by the Government National Mortgage Association. Later automobile loans, corporate loans, credit card receivables, and subprime mortgages were securitized. In many cases, investors in the securities created from these instruments did not have a guarantee against defaults.

Securitization played a part in the financial crisis that started in 2007. Tranches were created from subprime mortgages and new tranches were then created from these tranches. The origins of the crisis can be found in the U.S. housing market. The U.S. government was keen to encourage home ownership. Interest rates were low. Mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders found it attractive to do more business by relaxing their lending standards. Securitization meant that the investors bearing the credit risk were not usually the same as the original lenders. Rating agencies gave AAA ratings to the senior tranches that were created. There was no shortage of buyers for these AAA-rated tranches because their yields were higher than the yields on other AAA-rated securities. Banks thought the "good times" would continue and, because compensation plans focused their attention on short-term profits, chose to ignore the housing bubble and its potential impact on some very complicated products they were trading.

House prices rose as both first-time buyers and speculators entered the market. Some mortgages had included a low "teaser rate" for two or three years. After the teaser rate ended, there was a significant increase in the interest rate for some borrowers. Unable to meet the higher interest rate they had no choice but to default. This led to foreclosures and an increase in the supply of houses be sold. The price increases between 2000 and 2006 began to be reversed. Speculators and others who found that the amount owing on their mortgages was greater than the value of their houses (i.e., they had negative equity) defaulted. This accentuated the price decline.

Banks are paying a price for the crisis. New legislation and regulation will reduce their profitability. For example, capital requirements are being increased, liquidity regulations are being introduced, and OTC derivatives are being much more tightly regulated.

8.22. Suppose that mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDOs, similar to those in Figure 8.3, are resecuritized to form what is referred to as a "CDO squared." As in the case of tranches created from ABSs in Figure 8.3,  $65\%$  of the principal is allocated to a AAA tranche,  $25\%$  to a BBB tranche, and  $10\%$  to the equity tranche. How high does the loss percentage have to be on the underlying assets for losses to be experienced by a AAA-rated tranche that is created in this way? (Assume that every portfolio of assets that is used to create ABSs experiences the same loss rate.)

Before moving on to discuss how options and other more complex derivatives are valued, we consider various price adjustments that have become important in derivatives markets. These are the credit valuation adjustment (CVA), the debit (or debt) valuation adjustment (DVA), the funding valuation adjustment (FVA), the margin valuation adjustment (MVA), and the capital valuation adjustment (KVA). Collectively the adjustments are known as XVAs. Some of the adjustments have a stronger theoretical basis than others. As we shall see, financial economists have no problem with CVA and DVA, but have reservations about FVA, MVA, and KVA.

# 9.1 CVA AND DVA

Most of this book is concerned with determining the no-default value of derivatives, that is, the value assuming that neither of the two sides will default. CVA and DVA are adjustments to the no-default value reflecting the possibility of a default by one of the two sides. Here we provide an overview of them. More details on their calculation are in Chapter 24.

Suppose that a bank and a counterparty have entered into a portfolio of derivative transactions that are cleared bilaterally. The master agreement between the bank and the counterparty will almost certainly state that netting applies. This means that all outstanding derivatives between the two sides are considered as a single derivative in the event of a default. When one party declares bankruptcy, fails to post collateral as required, or fails to perform as promised in some other way, the other party will declare an event of default. This leads to an early termination of the outstanding derivatives between the bank and the counterparty a few days later and a settlement amount is calculated. The settlement amount reflects the value of the derivatives and is adjusted to allow for the fact that the nondefaulting party will incur costs equal to half the applicable bid-ask spreads when replacing the transactions in the portfolio.

Suppose that it is the bank's counterparty that defaults and neither side posts collateral. (Later we explain the impact of collateral.) If the early termination happens when the outstanding derivatives portfolio has a positive value to the bank and a negative value to the counterparty, the bank will be an unsecured creditor for the settlement amount and is likely to incur a loss because it will fail to receive it in full. In the opposite situation, where the portfolio has a negative value to the bank and a positive value to the counterparty, the settlement amount is owed by the bank to the counterparty (or to the counterparty's liquidators) and will be paid in full so that there is no loss.

The credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is the bank's estimate of the present value of the expected cost to the bank of a counterparty default. Suppose that the life of the longest outstanding derivatives transaction between the bank and the counterparty is  $T$  years. To calculate CVA, the bank divides the next  $T$  years into a number of intervals. For each interval, it calculates:

1. The probability of an early termination during the interval arising from a counterparty default; and
2. The present value of the expected loss from the derivatives portfolio if there is an early termination at the midpoint of the interval.

Suppose that there are  $N$  intervals,  $q_{i}$  is the probability of default by the counterparty during the  $i$ th interval, and  $\nu_{i}$  is the present value of the expected loss if there is a default at the midpoint of the  $i$ th interval. CVA is calculated as:

$$
\mathrm {C V A} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} q _ {i} v _ {i} \tag {9.1}
$$

This formula is deceptively simple but the procedure for implementing it is quite complicated and computationally very time-consuming. It will be explained in Chapter 24.

Define  $f_{\mathrm{nd}}$  as the no-default value of the derivatives portfolio to the bank. As explained earlier, this is the value of the portfolio assuming that neither side will default. When the possibility of a counterparty default is taken into account, the value of the portfolio to the bank becomes

$$ f _ {\mathrm {n d}} - \mathrm {C V A}
$$

But this is not the end of the story. The bank itself might default. This is liable to lead to a loss to the counterparty and an equal and opposite gain to the bank. The debit (or debt) valuation adjustment (DVA) is the present value of the expected gain to the bank from the possibility that it might itself default. It is calculated similarly to CVA:

$$
\mathrm {D V A} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} q _ {i} ^ {*} v _ {i} ^ {*} \tag {9.2}
$$ where  $q_{i}^{*}$  is the probability of a default by the bank during the  $i$ th interval and  $\nu_{i}^{*}$  is the present value of the bank's gain (and the counterparty's loss) if the bank defaults at the midpoint of the interval. Taking both CVA and DVA into account, the value of the portfolio to the bank is


$$ f _ {\mathrm {n d}} - \mathrm {C V A} + \mathrm {D V A}
$$

The idea that a bank will gain from its own default seems strange to many people. How can there be a gain from a default? One way of thinking about this is as follows. Derivatives are what are referred to as "zero-sum games." The gain to one side always equals the loss to the other side. If the bank's counterparty is worse off because of the possibility that the bank will default on the outstanding derivatives, the bank (or the bank's creditors) must be better off. The reason why this is so is that, in circumstances where it defaults, a bank avoids having to honor its contracts when the no-default value of those contracts to the bank is negative.

Without DVA, it is liable to be difficult for derivatives transactions to be agreed to. Consider two market participants, X and Y, who are negotiating a bilaterally cleared interest rate swap where X will be paying a fixed rate of interest and receiving LIBOR with no collateral being posted. For the purposes of our example we assume that there are no other trades between these two parties. The two sides agree that, if there is no default risk, the fixed rate should be  $2.2\%$ . We suppose that, when X takes Y's default risk into account, it determines it should pay  $2.1\%$  rather than  $2.2\%$ . (The  $0.1\%$  per annum reduction is compensation to X for possibility that Y might default.) But when Y takes X's default risk into account, it determines that it should receive  $2.35\%$  rather than  $2.2\%$ . (The extra  $0.15\%$  is compensation to Y for the possibility that X might default.) It is easy to see that the two sides are unlikely do a deal if each side considers only the possibility of the other side defaulting. But if each side calculates a DVA (recognizing that it might itself default), the two sides will have a better chance of doing a deal because they will value the expected cash flows from the swap similarly.

DVA has a counterintuitive effect. As the bank's creditworthiness declines,  $q_{i}^{*}$  in equation (9.2) increases and DVA increases. This makes the derivatives portfolio more valuable to the bank. As the bank's creditworthiness improves,  $q_{i}^{*}$  decreases and DVA decreases so that the portfolio is less valuable. Why should the bank gain from a worsening of its credit quality? The reason is that as the bank becomes more likely to default it is more likely that it will not have to honor its derivatives obligations.

# Collateral

When the agreement between the two parties requires collateral to be posted, the situation is more complicated. A credit support annex (CSA) to the master agreement specifies how the required amount of collateral is calculated and what form the collateral can take. Interest is normally paid on cash collateral at close to the fed funds rate or similar overnight rate. When the collateral takes the form of securities, a haircut is usually applied to the market value of the securities.

If a bank's counterparty defaults, the bank is entitled to keep any collateral that has been posted by the counterparty if it is less than any settlement amount it is owed. Similarly, if the bank defaults, the counterparty can use any collateral posted by the bank to cover any settlement amount it is owed. Any collateral in excess of the settlement amount must be returned.

Equations (9.1) and (9.2) are still correct when collateral is posted, but the calculation of  $\nu_{i}$  and  $\nu_{i}^{*}$  is more complicated. The calculation must take into account the collateral that would be provided by the bank to the counterparty or by the counterparty to the bank at the time of an early termination. Usually the calculation involves an assumption that the defaulting party will stop posting collateral, and will stop returning excess collateral, several days before the early termination. The number of days assumed here is known as the cure period or margin period of risk. For example, if the cure period is 10 days, the collateral at the time of the early termination would be assumed to be that specified in the CSA 10 days earlier.

# 9.2 FVA AND MVA

The funding valuation adjustment (FVA) and margin valuation adjustment (MVA) are adjustments to the value of a derivatives portfolio for the cost of funding derivative positions. To illustrate how they might arise, suppose that a derivatives dealer, Bank A, is in the situation illustrated in Figure 9.1. It has entered into a five-year interest rate swap with a corporate end user and has hedged its risk by entering into an exactly offsetting swap with another dealer, Bank B. It appears that Bank A has locked in a profit of  $0.1\%$  per year because it receives  $3\%$  from Bank B and pays  $2.9\%$  to the end user. We suppose that the transaction between Bank A and Bank B is cleared through a CCP with both sides posting initial margin and variation margin. (As explained in earlier chapters, this is required under post-crisis regulations for a standard swap such as this.)

If the transaction with the end user in Figure 9.1 were cleared through the same CCP as the transaction between the banks, Bank A's situation is straightforward. The CCP will net off the two transactions so that they do not lead to any incremental initial margin requirement for Bank A. Indeed, because the transactions always give a net positive value to the bank, margin requirements should be slightly less than they would be without the two transactions.

But let us assume that the transaction between Bank A and the end user is cleared bilaterally with no collateral being required while, as already mentioned, the transaction between Bank A and Bank B is cleared through a CCP. The transactions do then have some funding implications. First, the swap with Bank B is liable to lead the CCP requiring additional initial margin from Bank A during the life of the transaction. If we assume that the cost of funding initial margin is greater than the interest paid by the CCP on initial margin there is a cost to Bank A in funding the incremental initial margin attributable to the transaction. This is referred to as a margin valuation adjustment (MVA) and reduces the value to the bank of its transaction with the end user.[2]

The CCP's variation margin can also lead to funding requirements. Suppose that the transaction with Bank B has a negative value to Bank A so that the transaction with the end user has a positive value to Bank A. Bank A will have funds tied up in the variation margin it has posted with the CCP. It will not receive any collateral to offset this initial margin from the end user. This gives rise to a funding need because Bank A has to increase its funding from external sources. In the opposite situation, where the transaction with Bank B has a positive value and the transaction with the end user has a negative value, it receives variation margin from the CCP and does not have to provide any collateral or margin to the end user. This gives rise to a source of funding.

We continue to assume that the cost of funding margin is greater than the interest paid on it. There is a cost in the first case just considered (Bank A has to increase its funding from external sources) and a benefit in the second case (Bank A can reduce its funding from external sources). FVA is an adjustment to the value of derivatives that reflects these costs and benefits. The present value of the expected future funding cost is referred to as the funding cost adjustment (FCA) and the present value of the expected future funding benefit is referred to as the funding benefit adjustment (FBA). The funding value adjustment, FVA, reduces the value of derivatives by the excess of FCA over FBA. Whether there is a positive or negative adjustment to the value of the swaps in Figure 9.1 depends on whether the swap with Bank B is more likely to have a positive or negative value as time passes. This depends on the shape of the term structure of interest rates, as discussed in Section 7.7.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/a352edd032093b967e996d8b187b0da8f67ca3ed82568462f5a0e45a479a654b.jpg)

Figure 9.1 Swaps entered into by Bank A. The transaction with Bank B is cleared through a CCP. The transaction with the end user is cleared bilaterally.

The situation in Figure 9.1 is not the only way FVA and MVA can arise. An FVA potentially arises whenever a bank enters into an uncollateralized derivative transaction with a counterparty. When the uncollateralized derivative has a positive value, there is a funding cost. When it has a negative value, there is a funding benefit. For example, if the bank buys an uncollateralized option from a counterparty, the option has a positive value and there is a funding cost equal to the excess of the assumed cost of funding over the risk-free rate assumed in the pricing of the option. If the bank sells an uncollateralized option to the counterparty, the option has a negative value and there is a funding benefit. MVA can arise whenever a transaction gives rise to incremental initial margin requirements. As explained in earlier chapters, rules are being implemented requiring initial margin for bilaterally cleared transactions between financial institutions as well as for those cleared through CCPs.

To calculate the MVA or FVA it is necessary to answer the question: "What is the cost of funding the margin in a situation such as Figure 9.1?" This is where there is often a disagreement between theory and practice. Many banks argue that the cost of funding margin is equal to their average debt funding cost. Suppose the margin is provided in U.S. dollars. If the interest received by a bank on U.S. dollar margin is the federal funds rate minus 20 basis points and a bank's average funding cost is the federal funds rate plus 100 basis points, FVA and MVA would be calculated by these banks on the assumption of a funding cost of 120 basis points per year.

Financial economics argues that the way an investment is funded should not affect the required return on the investment. The required return should reflect the riskiness of the investment. An investment in initial margin or variation margin usually has very low risk. As such, the bank should be comfortable with a return that is close to the risk-free rate. If the return requirement on margin in our example is assumed to be the fed funds rate plus 10 basis points and the interest paid on margin is the federal funds rate minus 20 basis points, then the funding cost (or benefit) is 30 basis points, not the 120 basis points calculated earlier.

To explain why the average funding cost of the fed funds rate plus 100 basis points should not be used, Hull and White (2012) use two arguments. The first argument is that there is a gain to the bank from the 100 basis points credit spread because it might default on the debt it issues. This is similar to the DVA discussed earlier and is referred to as DVA2 by Hull and White. Because of this benefit, the bank does not have to pass the funding cost on to the derivatives desk.

For the second argument, suppose that the risk-free rate is  $2\%$  and the bank's funding cost is  $3.5\%$ . If a project comes along that is risk-free and provides a return of  $3\%$ , should the bank undertake it? The answer is that the project should be undertaken. The appropriate discount rate for the project's cash flows is  $2\%$  and the project has a positive present value when this discount rate is used. It is not correct to argue that the bank is funding itself at  $3.5\%$  and should therefore only undertake projects earning more than  $3.5\%$ .

Consider what happens as the bank enters into projects that are risk-free (or nearly risk-free). Its funding costs should come down in such a way that the incremental costs of funding a risk-free project should be  $2\%$ , not  $3.5\%$ . To take an extreme example, suppose that the bank we are considering were to double in size by undertaking entirely risk-free projects. The bank's funding cost should change to  $2.75\%$  (an average of  $3.5\%$  for the old projects and  $2\%$  for the new projects). If the average funding cost of  $3.5\%$  is used as the required return for all projects, low-risk projects will tend to seem unattractive and high-risk projects will tend to seem attractive.

Andersen et al. (2016) also question the use of average funding costs in calculating FVA. They consider the situation where debtholders do not anticipate the investment in margin that will be made by the bank and are pleasantly surprised because it leads to the bank becoming less risky.[10] There is then a transfer of wealth from the shareholders to the debtholders.

The XVA debate has an interesting analogy. In a first corporate finance course, students learn how to calculate a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a (nonfinancial) corporation and how the discount rate used for the expected cash flows of a capital investment project should be calculated. They learn that the discount rate should depend on the risk of the project, not how it is financed. For projects that are more risky than average, the discount rate should be higher than the WACC. For projects that are less risky than average, the discount rate should be lower than the WACC.

But many companies use a single discount rate for all projects. This tends to make risky projects more attractive than they should be and safe projects less attractive than they should be. With all else equal, the use of a single discount rate leads to companies becoming more risky over time.

The XVA analogy is that many of a bank's investments that we are concerned with when considering FVA and MVA are lower-than-average-risk investments. An investment in initial margin or variation margin is usually low risk compared with other things the bank does. As such, its marginal effect is to lower the average cost of the bank's funding.

The difference between the views of some financial engineers and financial economists on FVA and MVA is that financial economists work with marginal funding costs while the financial engineers work with average costs. The essence of the debate can be summarized by the following imaginary dialogue:

Financial Economist: The cost you should use for funding a project should reflect the risk of the project. By using average funding costs you are assuming that all the bank's projects are equally risky.

Financial Engineer: But tying up funds in initial margin or a low-risk hedged derivatives position prevents me from using the funds elsewhere. On average the bank gets a much higher return than it does on things like initial margin. There is a cost to low-risk, low-return projects.

Financial Economist: You talk as though funds for your business are in short supply. If you have good projects, whether they are low risk or high risk, the market will provide funding for you.

Financial Engineer: I am not sure that is how things work in practice.

# 9.3 KVA

KVA, capital valuation adjustment, is a charge to a derivatives transaction for the incremental capital requirements that the transaction gives rise to. Suppose that as a result of entering into a particular transaction a bank calculates that regulations require it to hold an extra 1 million of equity capital throughout the life of the transaction.[11] What is the cost of this?

Again there is a divergence between between financial economics theory and the opinions of many practitioners. Many practitioners would argue that if equity shareholders require a return of  $15\%$  per annum and a bank invests in a low-risk project that will require additional equity capital, the return on the additional capital should be at least  $15\%$ . (This is similar to nonfinancial companies using WACC as a hurdle rate for all projects, as discussed earlier.) In the derivatives context this means that there should be a price adjustment, a KVA, to ensure that the return on the incremental equity capital is  $15\%$ . Financial economists argue that how a company is financed should not affect how it evaluates projects (except possibly for tax effects). As a bank uses more equity to finance itself, it becomes less risky and the providers of both debt and equity capital require a lower return. This argument is over 50 years old in the finance literature and so its theoretical validity has stood the test of time. $^{12}$  Many practitioners disagree with the theory. As in the case of MVA and FVA the difference between the two sides is whether average or marginal capital costs should be used. We can imagine the following dialogue:

Financial Economist: You do not need to make a KVA. As long as derivatives book provides a return reflecting its risk your investors will be happy.

Practitioner: Equity capital requirements for derivatives have gone up since the crisis. My equity investors require a  $15\%$  per annum return. If I enter into a derivatives transaction that requires additional capital under the new regulations, I need to make sure that the return on that capital is at least  $15\%$ .

Financial Economist: But as more of the bank is financed by equity capital it becomes less risky and the return required by equity investors goes down. This is true even if the average risk of the whole bank does not change. So the marginal return required on new equity capital is low.

Practitioner: I am not sure that is how things work in practice.

# 9.4 CALCULATION ISSUES

All of the XVAs are computationally time-consuming to calculate. Monte Carlo simulations are necessary to determine expected credit exposures, expected funding costs, and expected capital requirements at future times. CVA is often actively managed by banks. They sometimes buy protection against their counterparties defaulting using credit default swaps (see Section 7.12 and Chapter 25) or similar instruments. This reduces their expected losses from defaults.

As discussed in Section 9.1, CVA and DVA must be calculated on the whole portfolio of derivatives that a bank has with a counterparty. It cannot be calculated on a transaction-by-transaction basis. This is because of the impact of netting. A new bilaterally cleared transaction with a counterparty will increase or decrease CVA and DVA depending on what happens when it is netted with other transactions that have been entered into with the counterparty. If it tends to increase credit exposure for the bank in the future, the incremental CVA will be positive; if it tends to decrease credit exposure in the future, the incremental CVA will decrease. Similarly for DVA.

The incremental FVA can be calculated on a transaction-by-transaction basis. This is because the net funding required for a portfolio of transactions at any future time is the sum of that for the individual transactions. $^{13}$  MVA for transactions cleared through a

CCP has to be calculated on a portfolio basis. In the case of the example in Figure 9.1, it is the impact of a new transaction on the initial margin required by the CCP for portfolio that Bank A is clearing through the CCP that determines the incremental initial margin requirements and therefore MVA. KVA is even more complicated. The rules used by regulators are such that a bank must in theory sometimes model the bank's whole portfolio when calculating incremental capital requirements.

# Application of Machine Learning

Because the calculation of XVAs is computationally quite time-consuming, some banks are using machine learning to get faster results. They are particularly interested in being able to quickly answer queries about the incremental effect of a proposed new transaction on the XVAs. A neural network is a tool that can be used to do this. It is a flexible algorithm that can learn any continuous relationship between the value of a target variable (the output) and the values of features (the inputs) when a huge volume of data is available. Once the network has been constructed, calculating the target from the features is very fast.

To create a neural network to calculate incremental XVAs, an analyst randomly creates many different data sets that are inputs to the calculation. (The data set will include features describing the proposed new transaction and features describing relevant aspects of existing trades with the counterparty.) Monte Carlo simulation is used to calculate the XVAs for each data set and an algorithm is used to find a neural network that replicates the Monte Carlo calculations as accurately as possible.

# SUMMARY

Banks and other derivatives market participants have for many years been concerned about counterparty credit risk. Two adjustments are the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) and debt or debit valuation adjustment (DVA). CVA is an adjustment by a bank for the possibility that its counterparty will default and it reduces the value of the derivatives portfolio it has with the counterparty. DVA is an adjustment for the possibility that the bank will default and it increases the value of the derivatives portfolio. There is no real argument about whether these adjustments should be made, but many people are less comfortable with DVA than CVA. Why should a bank benefit from the possibility that it will itself default? As the probability of a default increases, the benefit increases.

The funding valuation adjustment (FVA) is an adjustment to the value of a derivatives position arising from the funding required (or the funding generated) by a derivatives transaction. The margin valuation adjustment (MVA) quantifies the cost of funding initial margin. The capital valuation adjustment (KVA) is a valuation adjustment reflecting the impact of a derivatives position on capital requirements. Finance theory argues that the way a project is funded should not influence its valuation. In particular, the current average debt and equity costs should not be assumed to be the same as the incremental effect of a new transaction on funding costs. In spite of this, many banks do calculate MVA, FVA, and KVA based on these average costs.

# Mechanics of Options Markets

We introduced options in Chapter 1. This chapter explains how options markets are organized, what terminology is used, how the contracts are traded, how margin requirements are set, and so on. Later chapters will examine such topics as trading strategies involving options, the determination of option prices, and the ways in which portfolios of options can be hedged. This chapter is concerned primarily with stock options. It also presents some introductory material on currency options, index options, and futures options. More details concerning these instruments can be found in Chapters 17 and 18.

Options are fundamentally different from forward and futures contracts. An option gives the holder of the option the right to do something, but the holder does not have to exercise this right. By contrast, in a forward or futures contract, the two parties have committed themselves to some action. It costs a trader nothing (except for the margin/ collateral requirements) to enter into a forward or futures contract, whereas the purchase of an option requires an up-front payment.

When charts showing the gain or loss from options trading are produced, the usual practice is to ignore the time value of money, so that the profit is the final payoff minus the initial cost. This chapter follows this practice.

# 10.1 TYPES OF OPTIONS

As mentioned in Chapter 1, there are two types of options. A call option gives the holder of the option the right to buy an asset by a certain date for a certain price. A put option gives the holder the right to sell an asset by a certain date for a certain price. The date specified in the contract is known as the expiration date or the maturity date. The price specified in the contract is known as the exercise price or the strike price.

Options can be either American or European, a distinction that has nothing to do with geographical location. American options can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date, whereas European options can be exercised only on the expiration date itself. Most of the options that are traded on exchanges are American. However, European options are generally easier to analyze than American options, and some of the properties of an American option are frequently deduced from those of its European counterpart.

Figure 10.1 Profit from buying a European call option on one share of a stock. Option price = $5; strike price = $100.

# Call Options

Consider the situation of an investor who buys a European call option with a strike price of $100 to purchase 100 shares of a certain stock. Suppose that the current stock price is $98, the expiration date of the option is in 4 months, and the price of an option to purchase one share is $5. The initial investment is $500. Because the option is European, the investor can exercise only on the expiration date. If the stock price on this date is less than $100, the investor will clearly choose not to exercise. (There is no point in buying for $100 a share that has a market value of less than $100.) In these circumstances, the investor loses the whole of the initial investment of $500. If the stock price is above $100 on the expiration date, the option will be exercised. Suppose, for example, that the stock price is $115. By exercising the option, the investor is able to buy 100 shares for $100 per share. If the shares are sold immediately, the investor makes a gain of $15 per share, or $1,500, ignoring transaction costs. When the initial cost of the option is taken into account, the net profit to the investor is $1,000.

Figure 10.1 shows how the investor's net profit or loss on an option to purchase one share varies with the final stock price in this example. For instance, when the final stock price is  $120 the profit from an option to purchase one share is$ 15. It is important to realize that an investor sometimes exercises an option and makes a loss overall. Suppose that, in the example, the stock price is $102 at the expiration of the option. The investor would exercise for a gain of  $102 -$ 100 = $2 per option and realize a loss overall of $3 when the initial cost of the option is taken into account. It is tempting to argue that the investor should not exercise the option in these circumstances. However, not exercising would lead to a loss of $5, which is worse than the 3 loss when the investor exercises. In general, call options should always be exercised at the expiration date if the stock price is above the strike price.

# Put Options

Whereas the purchaser of a call option is hoping that the stock price will increase, the purchaser of a put option is hoping that it will decrease. Consider an investor who buys a European put option with a strike price of  $70 to sell 100 shares of a certain stock. Suppose that the current stock price is$ 65, the expiration date of the option is in 3 months, and the price of an option to sell one share is $7. The initial investment is $700. Because the option is European, it will be exercised only if the stock price is below $70 on the expiration date. Suppose that the stock price is $55 on this date. The investor can buy 100 shares for $55 per share and, under the terms of the put option, sell the same shares for $70 to realize a gain of $15 per share, or $1,500. (Again, transaction costs are ignored.) When the $700 initial cost of the option is taken into account, the investor's net profit is $800. There is no guarantee that the investor will make a gain. If the final stock price is above $70, the put option expires worthless, and the investor loses $700. Figure 10.2 shows the way in which the investor's profit or loss on an option to sell one share varies with the terminal stock price in this example.

Figure 10.2 Profit from buying a European put option on one share of a stock. Option price = $7; strike price = $70.

# Early Exercise

As mentioned earlier, exchange-traded stock options are usually American rather than European. This means that the investor in the foregoing examples would not have to wait until the expiration date before exercising the option. We will see later that there are some circumstances when it is optimal to exercise American options before the expiration date.

# 10.2 OPTION POSITIONS

There are two sides to every option contract. On one side is the investor who has taken the long position (i.e., has bought the option). On the other side is the investor who has taken a short position (i.e., has sold or written the option). The writer of an option receives cash up front, but has potential liabilities later. The writer's profit or loss is the reverse of that for the purchaser of the option. Figures 10.3 and 10.4 show the variation of the profit or loss with the final stock price for writers of the options considered in Figures 10.1 and 10.2.

Figure 10.3 Profit from writing a European call option on one share of a stock. Option price = $5; strike price = $100.

There are four types of option positions:

1. A long position in a call option
2. A long position in a put option
3. A short position in a call option
4. A short position in a put option.

It is often useful to characterize a European option in terms of its payoff to the purchaser of the option. The initial cost of the option is then not included in the calculation. If  $K$  is the strike price and  $S_{T}$  is the final price of the underlying asset, the payoff from a long position in a European call option is

$$
\max  (S _ {T} - K, 0)
$$

This reflects the fact that the option will be exercised if  $S_T > K$  and will not be exercised if  $S_T \leq K$ . The payoff to the holder of a short position in the European call option is

$$
- \max  (S _ {T} - K, 0) = \min  (K - S _ {T}, 0)
$$

The payoff to the holder of a long position in a European put option is

$$
\max  (K - S _ {T}, 0)
$$ and the payoff from a short position in a European put option is


$$
- \max  (K - S _ {T}, 0) = \min  (S _ {T} - K, 0)
$$

Figure 10.5 illustrates these payoffs.

# 10.3 UNDERLYING ASSETS

This section provides a first look at how options on stocks, currencies, stock indices, and futures are traded on exchanges.

# Stock Options

Most trading in stock options is on exchanges. In the United States, the exchanges include the Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com), NYSE Euronext (www.euronext.com), which acquired the American Stock Exchange in 2008, the International Securities Exchange (www.ise.com), and the Boston Options Exchange (www.bostonoptions.com). Options trade on several thousand different stocks. One contract gives the holder the right to buy or sell 100 shares at the specified strike price. This contract size is convenient because the shares themselves are usually traded in lots of 100.

# ETP Options

The CBOE trades options on many exchange-traded products (ETPs). ETPs are listed on an exchange and traded like a share of a company's stock. They are designed to replicate the performance of a particular market, often by tracking an underlying benchmark index. ETPs are sometimes also referred to as exchange-traded vehicles (ETVs). The most common ETP is an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This is usually designed to track an equity index or a bond index. For example, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF trust is designed to provide investors with the return they would earn if they invested in the 500 stocks that constitute the S&P 500 index. Other ETPs are designed to track the performance of commodities or currencies.

# Foreign Currency Options

Most currency options trading is now in the over-the-counter market, but there is some exchange trading. Exchanges trading foreign currency options in the United States include NASDAQ OMX (www.nasdaqtrader.com), which acquired the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in 2008. This exchange offers European-style contracts on a variety of different currencies. One contract is to buy or sell 10,000 units of a foreign currency (1,000,000 units in the case of the Japanese yen) for U.S. dollars. Foreign currency options contracts are discussed further in Chapter 17.

# Index Options

Many different index options currently trade throughout the world in both the over-the-counter market and the exchange-traded market. The most popular exchange-traded contracts in the United States are those on the S&P 500 Index (SPX), the S&P 100 Index (OEX), the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX), and the Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJX). All of these trade on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Most of the contracts are European. An exception is the OEX contract on the S&P 100, which is American. One contract is usually to buy or sell 100 times the index at the specified strike price. Settlement is always in cash, rather than by delivering the portfolio underlying the index. Consider, for example, one call contract on an index with a strike price of 980. If it is exercised when the value of the index is 992, the writer of the contract pays the holder (992 - 980) \times 100 = \1,200. Index options are discussed further in Chapter 17.

# Futures Options

When an exchange trades a particular futures contract, it often also trades American options on that contract. The life of a futures option normally ends a short period of time before the expiration of trading in the underlying futures contract. When a call option is exercised, the holder's gain equals the excess of the futures price over the strike price. When a put option is exercised, the holder's gain equals the excess of the strike price over the futures price. Futures options contracts are discussed further in Chapter 18.


# 10.4 SPECIFICATION OF STOCK OPTIONS

In the rest of this chapter, we will focus on stock options. As already mentioned, a standard exchange-traded stock option in the United States is an American-style option contract to buy or sell 100 shares of the stock. Details of the contract (the expiration date, the strike price, what happens when dividends are declared, how large a position investors can hold, and so on) are specified by the exchange.

# Expiration Dates

One of the items used to describe a stock option is the month in which the expiration date occurs. Thus, a January call trading on IBM is a call option on IBM with an expiration date in January. The precise expiration date is the third Friday of the expiration month and trading takes place every business day (8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Chicago time) until the expiration date.

Stock options in the United States are on a January, February, or March cycle. The January cycle consists of the months of January, April, July, and October. The February cycle consists of the months of February, May, August, and November. The March cycle consists of the months of March, June, September, and December. If the expiration date for the current month has not yet been reached, options trade with expiration dates in the current month, the following month, and the next two months in the cycle. If the expiration date of the current month has passed, options trade with expiration dates in the next month, the next-but-one month, and the next two months of the expiration cycle. Consider, for example, an option on a January cycle. At the beginning of January, options are traded with expiration dates in January, February, April, and July; at the end of January, they are traded with expiration dates in February, March, April, and July; at the beginning of May, they are traded with expiration dates in May, June, July, and October; and so on. When one option reaches expiration, trading in another is started. When there is a great deal of interest in a company, options expiring in other months may trade. Also, options expiring on Fridays other than the third Friday of a month sometimes trade. The latter are known as weekly's.

Longer-term options, known as LEAPS (long-term equity anticipation securities), also trade on many stocks in the United States. These have expiration dates up to 39 months into the future. The expiration dates for LEAPS on stocks are always the third Friday of a January.

# Strike Prices

The exchange normally chooses the strike prices at which options can be written so that they are spaced $2.50, $5, or $10 apart. Typically the spacing is $2.50 when the stock price is between $5 and $25, $5 when the stock price is between $25 and 200, and

$10 for stock prices above$ 200. As will be explained shortly, stock splits and stock dividends can lead to nonstandard strike prices.

# Terminology

For any given asset at any given time, many different option contracts may be trading. Suppose there are four expiration dates and five strike prices for options on a particular stock. If call and put options trade with every expiration date and every strike price, there are a total of 40 different contracts. All options of the same type (calls or puts) on a stock are referred to as an option class. For example, IBM calls are one class, whereas IBM puts are another class. An option series consists of all the options of a given class with the same expiration date and strike price. In other words, it refers to a particular contract that is traded. For example, IBM 160 October 2021 calls would constitute an option series.

Options are referred to as in the money, at the money, or out of the money. If  $S$  is the stock price and  $K$  is the strike price, a call option is in the money when  $S > K$ , at the money when  $S = K$ , and out of the money when  $S < K$ . A put option is in the money when  $S < K$ , at the money when  $S = K$ , and out of the money when  $S > K$ . Clearly, an option will be exercised only when it is in the money. In the absence of transaction costs, an in-the-money option will always be exercised on the expiration date if it has not been exercised previously. $^{1}$

The intrinsic value of an option is defined as the value it would have if there were no time to maturity, so that the exercise decision had to be made immediately. For a call option, the intrinsic value is therefore  $\max(S - K, 0)$ . For a put option, it is  $\max(K - S, 0)$ . An in-the-money American option must be worth at least as much as its intrinsic value because the holder has the right to exercise it immediately. Often it is optimal for the holder of an in-the-money American option to wait rather than exercise immediately. The excess of an option's value over its intrinsic value is the option's time value. The total value of an option is therefore the sum of its intrinsic value and its time value.

# FLEX Options

The Chicago Board Options Exchange offers FLEX (short for flexible) options on equities and equity indices. These are options where the traders agree to nonstandard terms. These nonstandard terms can involve a strike price or an expiration date that is different from what is usually offered by the exchange. They can also involve the option being European when it is normally American or vice versa. FLEX options are an attempt by option exchanges to regain business from the over-the-counter markets. The exchange specifies a minimum size (e.g., 100 contracts) for FLEX option trades.

# Dividends and Stock Splits

The early over-the-counter options were dividend protected. If a company declared a cash dividend, the strike price for options on the company's stock was reduced on the ex-dividend day by the amount of the dividend. Exchange-traded options are not usually adjusted for cash dividends. In other words, when a cash dividend occurs, there are no adjustments to the terms of the option contract. An exception is sometimes made for large cash dividends. When a dividend greater than  $10\%$  of the stock price is declared, a committee of the Options Clearing Corporation at the CBOE can decide to adjust the terms of call and put options on the stock. Typically the effect of the adjustment is to reduce the strike price by the amount of the dividend.


Exchange-traded options are adjusted for stock splits. A stock split occurs when the existing shares are "split" into more shares. For example, in a 3-for-1 stock split, three new shares are issued to replace each existing share. Because a stock split does not change the assets or the earning ability of a company, we should not expect it to have any effect on the wealth of the company's shareholders. All else being equal, the 3-for-1 stock split should cause the stock price to go down to one-third of its previous value. In general, an  $n$ -for- $m$  stock split should cause the stock price to go down to  $m / n$  of its previous value. The terms of option contracts are adjusted to reflect expected changes in a stock price arising from a stock split. After an  $n$ -for- $m$  stock split, the strike price is reduced to  $m / n$  of its previous value, and the number of shares covered by one contract is increased to  $n / m$  of its previous value. If the stock price declines in the way expected, the positions of both the writer and the purchaser of a contract remain unchanged.

# Example 10.1

Consider a call option to buy 100 shares of a company for  $30 per share. Suppose the company makes a 2-for-1 stock split. The terms of the option contract are then changed so that it gives the holder the right to purchase 200 shares for$ 15 per share.

Stock options are adjusted for stock dividends. A stock dividend involves a company issuing more shares to its existing shareholders. For example, a  $20\%$  stock dividend means that investors receive one new share for each five already owned. A stock dividend, like a stock split, has no effect on either the assets or the earning power of a company. The stock price can be expected to go down as a result of a stock dividend. The  $20\%$  stock dividend referred to is essentially the same as a 6-for-5 stock split. All else being equal, it should cause the stock price to decline to  $5/6$  of its previous value. The terms of an option are adjusted to reflect the expected price decline arising from a stock dividend in the same way as they are for that arising from a stock split.

# Example 10.2

Consider a put option to sell 100 shares of a company for  $15 per share. Suppose the company declares a 25\%$  stock dividend. This is equivalent to a 5-for-4 stock split. The terms of the option contract are changed so that it gives the holder the right to sell 125 shares for 12.

Adjustments are also made for rights issues. The basic procedure is to calculate the theoretical price of the rights and then to reduce the strike price by this amount.

# Position Limits and Exercise Limits

The Chicago Board Options Exchange often specifies a position limit for option contracts. This defines the maximum number of option contracts that an investor can hold on one side of the market. For this purpose, long calls and short puts are considered to be on the same side of the market. Also considered to be on the same side are short calls and long puts. The exercise limit usually equals the position limit. It defines the maximum number of contracts that can be exercised by any individual (or group of individuals acting together) in any period of five consecutive business days. Options on the largest and most frequently traded stocks have positions limits of 250,000 contracts. Smaller capitalization stocks have position limits of 200,000, 75,000, 50,000, or 25,000 contracts.


Position limits and exercise limits are designed to prevent the market from being unduly influenced by the activities of an individual investor or group of investors. However, whether the limits are really necessary is a controversial issue.

# 10.5 TRADING

Traditionally, exchanges have had to provide a large open area for individuals to meet and trade options. This has changed. Most derivatives exchanges are fully electronic, so traders do not have to physically meet. The International Securities Exchange (www.ise.com) launched the first all-electronic options market for equities in the United States in May 2000. Over  $95\%$  of the orders at the Chicago Board Options Exchange are handled electronically. The remainder are mostly large or complex institutional orders that require the skills of traders.

# Market Makers

Most options exchanges use market makers to facilitate trading. A market maker for a certain option is an individual who, when asked to do so, will quote both a bid and an ask price on the option. The bid is the price at which the market maker is prepared to buy, and the ask (or offer) is the price at which the market maker is prepared to sell. At the time the bid and ask prices are quoted, the market maker does not know whether the trader who asked for the quotes wants to buy or sell the option. The ask is always higher than the bid, and the amount by which the ask exceeds the bid is referred to as the bid-ask spread. The exchange sets upper limits for the bid-ask spread. For example, it might specify that the spread be no more than $0.25 for options priced at less than $0.50, $0.50 for options priced between $0.50 and $10, $0.75 for options priced between $10 and $20, and $1 for options priced over $20.

The existence of the market maker ensures that buy and sell orders can always be executed at some price without any delays. Market makers therefore add liquidity to the market. The market makers themselves make their profits from the bid-ask spread. They use methods such as those that will be discussed in Chapter 19 to hedge their risks.

# Offsetting Orders

An investor who has purchased options can close out the position by issuing an offsetting order to sell the same number of options. Similarly, an investor who has written options can close out the position by issuing an offsetting order to buy the same number of options. (In this respect options markets are similar to futures markets.) If, when an option contract is traded, neither investor is closing an existing position, the open interest increases by one contract. If one investor is closing an existing position and the other is not, the open interest stays the same. If both investors are closing existing positions, the open interest goes down by one contract.

# 10.6 TRADING COSTS

The types of orders that can be placed with a broker for options trading are similar to those for futures trading (see Section 2.8). A market order is executed immediately, a limit order specifies the least favorable price at which the order can be executed, and so on.

When options are traded online, the broker will typically charge a fixed fee plus a per-contract fee. For example, the base fee might be $2.50 and the per-contract fee $0.50. There is also typically a fee charged for exercising an option, and an assignment fee when a trader is short an option and is the subject of an exercise. Sometimes it is cheaper to sell an option than pay the fee for exercising it. (See www.stockbrokers.com/guides/features-fees to compare the fees charged by 16 U.S. brokers.)

A hidden cost in option trading (and in many other financial transactions) is the market maker's bid-ask spread. Suppose that, in the example just considered, the bid price was $4.00 and the ask price was $4.50 at the time the option was purchased. We can reasonably assume that a "fair" price for the option is halfway between the bid and the ask price, or $4.25. The cost to the buyer and to the seller of the market maker system is the difference between the fair price and the price paid. This is $0.25 per option, or 25 per contract.

# 10.7 MARGIN REQUIREMENTS

We discussed margin requirements for futures contracts in Chapter 2. The purpose of margin is to provide a guarantee that the entity providing margin will live up to its obligations. If a trader buys an asset such as a stock or an option for cash there is no margin requirement. This is because the trade does not give rise to future obligations. As discussed in Section 5.2, if the trader shorts a stock, margin is required because the trader then has the obligation to close out the position by buying the stock at some future time. Similarly, when the trader sells (i.e., writes) an option, margin is required because the trader has obligations in the event that the option is exercised.

Assets are not always purchased for cash. For example, when shares are purchased in the United States, an investor can borrow up to  $50\%$  of the price from the broker. This is known as buying on margin. If the share price declines so that the loan is substantially more than  $50\%$  of the stock's current value, there is a "margin call", where the broker requests that cash be deposited by the investor. If the margin call is not met, the broker sells the stock.

When call and put options with maturities less than 9 months are purchased, the option price must be paid in full. Investors are not allowed to buy these options on margin because options already contain substantial leverage and buying on margin would raise this leverage to an unacceptable level. For options with maturities greater than 9 months investors can buy on margin, borrowing up to  $25\%$  of the option value.

# Writing Naked Options

As mentioned, a trader who writes options is required to maintain funds in a margin account. Both the trader's broker and the exchange want to be satisfied that the trader will not default if the option is exercised. The amount of margin required depends on the trader's position.

A naked option is an option that is not combined with an offsetting position in the underlying stock. The initial and maintenance margin required by the CBOE for a written naked call option is the greater of the following two calculations:

1. A total of  $100\%$  of the proceeds of the sale plus  $20\%$  of the underlying share price less the amount, if any, by which the option is out of the money
2. A total of  $100\%$  of the option proceeds plus  $10\%$  of the underlying share price.

For a written naked put option, it is the greater of

1. A total of  $100\%$  of the proceeds of the sale plus  $20\%$  of the underlying share price less the amount, if any, by which the option is out of the money
2. A total of  $100\%$  of the option proceeds plus  $10\%$  of the exercise price.

The  $20\%$  in the preceding calculations is replaced by  $15\%$  for options on a broadly based stock index because a stock index is usually less volatile than the price of an individual stock.

# Example 10.3

An investor writes four naked call option contracts on a stock. The option price is $5, the strike price is $40, and the stock price is $38. Because the option is $2 out of the money, the first calculation gives

$$

4 0 0 \times (5 + 0. 2 \times 3 8 - 2) = \$ 4, 2 4 0

$$

The second calculation gives

$$

4 0 0 \times (5 + 0. 1 \times 3 8) = \$ 3, 5 2 0

$$

The initial margin requirement is therefore  $4,240. Note that, if the option had been a put, it would be$ 2 in the money and the margin requirement would be

$$

4 0 0 \times (5 + 0. 2 \times 3 8) = \$ 5, 0 4 0

$$

In both cases, the proceeds of the sale can be used to form part of the margin account.

A calculation similar to the initial margin calculation (but with the current market price of the contract replacing the proceeds of sale) is repeated every day. Funds can be withdrawn from the margin account when the calculation indicates that the margin required is less than the current balance in the margin account. When the calculation indicates that a greater margin is required, a margin call will be made.

# Other Rules

In Chapter 12, we will examine option trading strategies such as covered calls, protective puts, spreads, combinations, straddles, and strangles. The CBOE has special rules for determining the margin requirements when these trading strategies are used. These are described in the CBOE Margin Manual, which is available on the CBOE website (www.cboe.com).

As an example of the rules, consider an investor who writes a covered call. This is a written call option when the shares that might have to be delivered are already owned.

Covered calls are far less risky than naked calls, because the worst that can happen is that the investor is required to sell shares already owned at below their market value. No margin is required on the written option. However, the investor can borrow an amount equal to  $0.5\min(S,K)$ , rather than the usual  $0.5S$ , on the stock position.

# 10.8 THE OPTIONS CLEARING CORPORATION

The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) performs much the same function for options markets as the clearing house does for futures markets (see Chapter 2). It guarantees that options writers will fulfill their obligations under the terms of options contracts and keeps a record of all long and short positions. The OCC has a number of members, and all option trades must be cleared through a member. If a broker is not itself a member of an exchange's OCC, it must arrange to clear its trades with a member. Members are required to have a certain minimum amount of capital and to contribute to a special fund that can be used if any member defaults on an option obligation.

The funds used to purchase an option must be deposited with the OCC by the morning of the business day following the trade. The writer of the option maintains a margin account with a broker, as described earlier.2 The broker maintains a margin account with the OCC member that clears its trades. The OCC member in turn maintains a margin account with the OCC.

# Exercising an Option

When an investor instructs a broker to exercise an option, the broker notifies the OCC member that clears its trades. This member then places an exercise order with the OCC. The OCC randomly selects a member with an outstanding short position in the same option. The member, using a procedure established in advance, selects a particular investor who has written the option. If the option is a call, this investor is required to sell stock at the strike price. If it is a put, the investor is required to buy stock at the strike price. The investor is said to be assigned. The buy/sell transaction takes place on the third business day following the exercise order. When an option is exercised, the open interest goes down by one.

At the expiration of the option, all in-the-money options should be exercised unless the transaction costs are so high as to wipe out the payoff from the option. Some brokers will automatically exercise options for a client at expiration when it is in their client's interest to do so. Many exchanges also have rules for exercising options that are in the money at expiration.

# 10.9 REGULATION

Exchange-traded options markets are regulated in a number of different ways. Both the exchange and Options Clearing Corporations have rules governing the behavior of traders. In addition, there are both federal and state regulatory authorities. In general, options markets have demonstrated a willingness to regulate themselves. There have been no major scandals or defaults by OCC members. Investors can have a high level of confidence in the way the market is run.


The Securities and Exchange Commission is responsible for regulating options markets in stocks, stock indices, currencies, and bonds at the federal level. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is responsible for regulating markets for options on futures. The major options markets are in the states of Illinois and New York. These states actively enforce their own laws on unacceptable trading practices.

# 10.10 TAXATION

Determining the tax implications of option trading strategies can be tricky, and an investor who is in doubt about this should consult a tax specialist. In the United States, the general rule is that (unless the taxpayer is a professional trader) gains and losses from the trading of stock options are taxed as capital gains or losses. The way that capital gains and losses are taxed in the United States was discussed in Section 2.10. For both the holder and the writer of a stock option, a gain or loss is recognized when (a) the option expires unexercised or (b) the option position is closed out. If the option is exercised, the gain or loss from the option is rolled into the position taken in the stock and recognized when the stock position is closed out. For example, when a call option is exercised, the party with a long position is deemed to have purchased the stock at the strike price plus the call price. This is then used as a basis for calculating this party's gain or loss when the stock is eventually sold. Similarly, the party with the short call position is deemed to have sold the stock at the strike price plus the call price. When a put option is exercised, the seller of the option is deemed to have bought the stock for the strike price less the original put price and the purchaser of the option is deemed to have sold the stock for the strike price less the original put price.

# Wash Sale Rule

One tax consideration in option trading in the United States is the wash sale rule. To understand this rule, imagine an investor who buys a stock when the price is $60 and plans to keep it for the long term. If the stock price drops to $40, the investor might be tempted to sell the stock and then immediately repurchase it, so that the 20 loss is realized for tax purposes. To prevent this practice, the tax authorities have ruled that when the repurchase is within 30 days of the sale (i.e., between 30 days before the sale and 30 days after the sale), any loss on the sale is not deductible. The disallowance also applies where, within the 61-day period, the taxpayer enters into an option or similar contract to acquire the stock. Thus, selling a stock at a loss and buying a call option within a 30-day period will lead to the loss being disallowed.

# Constructive Sales

Prior to 1997, if a United States taxpayer shorted a security while holding a long position in a substantially identical security, no gain or loss was recognized until the

# Business Snapshot 10.1 Tax Planning Using Options

As a simple example of a possible tax planning strategy using options, suppose that Country A has a tax regime where the tax is low on interest and dividends and high on capital gains, while Country B has a tax regime where tax is high on interest and dividends and low on capital gains. It is advantageous for a company to receive the income from a security in Country A and the capital gain, if there is one, in Country B. The company would like to keep capital losses in Country A, where they can be used to offset capital gains on other items. All of this can be accomplished by arranging for a subsidiary company in Country A to have legal ownership of the security and for a subsidiary company in Country B to buy a call option on the security from the company in Country A, with the strike price of the option equal to the current value of the security. During the life of the option, income from the security is earned in Country A. If the security price rises sharply, the option will be exercised and the capital gain will be realized in Country B. If it falls sharply, the option will not be exercised and the capital loss will be realized in Country A.

short position was closed out. This means that short positions could be used to defer recognition of a gain for tax purposes. The situation was changed by the Tax Relief Act of 1997. An appreciated property is now treated as "constructively sold" when the owner does one of the following:

1. Enters into a short sale of the same or substantially identical property
2. Enters into a futures or forward contract to deliver the same or substantially identical property
3. Enters into one or more positions that eliminate substantially all of the loss and opportunity for gain.

It should be noted that transactions reducing only the risk of loss or only the opportunity for gain should not result in constructive sales. Therefore an investor holding a long position in a stock can buy in-the-money put options on the stock without triggering a constructive sale.

Tax practitioners sometimes use options to minimize tax costs or maximize tax benefits (see Business Snapshot 10.1). Tax authorities in many jurisdictions have proposed legislation designed to combat the use of derivatives for tax purposes. Before entering into any tax-motivated transaction, a corporate treasurer or private individual should explore in detail how the structure could be unwound in the event of legislative change and how costly this process could be.

# 10.11 WARRANTS, EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, AND CONVERTIBLES

Warrants are options issued by a financial institution or nonfinancial corporation. For example, a financial institution might issue 1 million put warrants on gold, each warrant giving the holder the right to sell 10 ounces of gold for 1,000 per ounce. It could then proceed to create a market for the warrants. To exercise the warrant, the holder would contact the financial institution. A common use of warrants by a non-financial corporation is at the time of a bond issue. The corporation issues call warrants giving the holder the right to buy its own stock for a certain price at a certain future time and then attaches them to the bonds to make the bonds more attractive to investors.


Employee stock options are call options issued to employees by their company to motivate them to act in the best interests of the company's shareholders (see Chapter 16). They are usually at the money at the time of issue. Accounting standards now require them to be expensed at fair market value on the income statement of the company.

Convertible bonds, often referred to as convertibles, are bonds issued by a company that can be converted into equity at certain times using a predetermined exchange ratio. They are therefore bonds with an embedded call option on the company's stock.

One feature of warrants, employee stock options, and convertibles is that a predetermined number of options are issued. By contrast, the number of options on a particular stock that trade on the CBOE or another exchange is not predetermined. (As people take positions in a particular option series, the number of options outstanding increases; as people close out positions, it declines.) Warrants issued by a company on its own stock, employee stock options, and convertibles are different from exchange-traded options in another important way. When these instruments are exercised, the company issues more shares of its own stock and sells them to the option holder for the strike price. The exercise of the instruments therefore leads to an increase in the number of shares of the company's stock that are outstanding. By contrast, when an exchange-traded call option is exercised, the party with the short position buys in the market shares that have already been issued and sells them to the party with the long position for the strike price. The company whose stock underlies the option is not involved in any way.

# 10.12 OVER-THE-COUNTER OPTIONS MARKETS

Most of this chapter has focused on exchange-traded options markets. The over-the-counter market for options has become increasingly important since the early 1980s and is now larger than the exchange-traded market. As explained in Chapter 1, the main participants in over-the-counter markets are financial institutions, corporate treasurers, and fund managers. There is a wide range of assets underlying the options. Over-the-counter options on foreign exchange and interest rates are particularly popular. The chief potential disadvantage of the over-the-counter market is that the option writer may default. This means that the purchaser is subject to some credit risk. In an attempt to overcome this disadvantage, market participants (and regulators) often require counterparties to post collateral. This was discussed in Section 2.5.

The instruments traded in the over-the-counter market are often structured by financial institutions to meet the precise needs of their clients. Sometimes this involves choosing exercise dates, strike prices, and contract sizes that are different from those offered by an exchange. In other cases the structure of the option is different from standard calls and puts. The option is then referred to as an exotic option. Chapter 26 describes a number of different types of exotic options.

# SUMMARY

There are two types of options: calls and puts. A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset for a certain price by a certain date. A put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. There are four possible positions in options markets: a long position in a call, a short position in a call, a long position in a put, and a short position in a put. Taking a short position in an option is known as writing it. Options are currently traded on stocks, stock indices, foreign currencies, futures contracts, and other assets.

An exchange must specify the terms of the option contracts it trades. In particular, it must specify the size of the contract, the precise expiration time, and the strike price. In the United States one stock option contract gives the holder the right to buy or sell 100 shares. The standard expiration of a stock option contract is the third Friday of the expiration month. Options with several different expiration months trade at any given time. Strike prices are at $2½, $5, or 10 intervals, depending on the stock price.

The terms of a stock option are not normally adjusted for cash dividends. However, they are adjusted for stock dividends, stock splits, and rights issues. The aim of the adjustment is to keep the positions of both the writer and the buyer of a contract unchanged.

Most option exchanges use market makers. A market maker is an individual who is prepared to quote both a bid price (at which he or she is prepared to buy) and an ask price (at which he or she is prepared to sell). Market makers improve the liquidity of the market and ensure that there is never any delay in executing market orders. They themselves make a profit from the difference between their bid and ask prices (known as their bid-ask spread). The exchange has rules specifying upper limits for the bid-ask spread.

Writers of options have potential liabilities and are required to maintain a margin account with their brokers. If it is not a member of the Options Clearing Corporation, the broker will maintain a margin account with a firm that is a member. This firm will in turn maintain a margin account with the Options Clearing Corporation. The Options Clearing Corporation is responsible for keeping a record of all outstanding contracts, handling exercise orders, and so on.

Not all options are traded on exchanges. Many options are traded in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. An advantage of over-the-counter options is that they can be tailored by a financial institution to meet the particular needs of a corporate treasurer or fund manager.

# Properties of Stock Options

In this chapter, we look at the factors affecting stock option prices. We use a number of different arbitrage arguments to explore the relationships between European option prices, American option prices, and the underlying stock price. The most important of these relationships is put-call parity, which is a relationship between the price of a European call option, the price of a European put option, and the underlying stock price.

The chapter examines whether American options should be exercised early. It shows that it is never optimal to exercise an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock prior to the option's expiration, but that under some circumstances the early exercise of an American put option on such a stock is optimal. When there are dividends, it can be optimal to exercise either calls or puts early.

# 11.1 FACTORS AFFECTING OPTION PRICES

There are six factors affecting the price of a stock option:

1. The current stock price,  $S_0$
2. The strike price,  $K$
3. The time to expiration,  $T$
4. The volatility of the stock price,  $\sigma$
5. The risk-free interest rate,  $r$
6. The dividends that are expected to be paid.

In this section, we consider what happens to option prices when there is a change to one of these factors, with all the other factors remaining fixed. The results are summarized in Table 11.1.

Figures 11.1 and 11.2 show how European call and put prices depend on the first five factors in the situation where  $S_0 = 50$ ,  $K = 50$ ,  $r = 5\%$  per annum,  $\sigma = 30\%$  per annum,  $T = 1$  year, and there are no dividends. In this case the call price is 7.116 and the put price is 4.677.

<table><tr><td>Variable</td><td>European call</td><td>European put</td><td>American call</td><td>American put</td></tr><tr><td>Current stock price</td><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Strike price</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>Time to expiration</td><td>?</td><td>?</td><td>+</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>Volatility</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>Risk-free rate</td><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Amount of future dividends</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>+</td></tr></table>

+ indicates that an increase in the variable causes the option price to increase or stay the same;
- indicates that an increase in the variable causes the option price to decrease or stay the same;
? indicates that the relationship is uncertain.

# Stock Price and Strike Price

If a call option is exercised at some future time, the payoff will be the amount by which the stock price exceeds the strike price. Call options therefore become more valuable as the stock price increases and less valuable as the strike price increases. For a put option, the payoff on exercise is the amount by which the strike price exceeds the stock price. Put options therefore behave in the opposite way from call options: they become less valuable as the stock price increases and more valuable as the strike price increases. Figure 11.1a–d illustrate the way in which put and call prices depend on the stock price and strike price.

# Time to Expiration

Now consider the effect of the expiration date. Both put and call American options become more valuable (or at least do not decrease in value) as the time to expiration increases. Consider two American options that differ only as far as the expiration date is concerned. The owner of the long-life option has all the exercise opportunities open to the owner of the short-life option—and more. The long-life option must therefore always be worth at least as much as the short-life option.

Although European put and call options usually become more valuable as the time to expiration increases (see Figure 11.1e, f), this is not always the case. Consider two European call options on a stock: one with an expiration date in 1 month, the other with an expiration date in 2 months. Suppose that a very large dividend is expected in 6 weeks. The dividend will cause the stock price to decline, so that the short-life option could be worth more than the long-life option. As we explain later in the chapter, it can be optimal to exercise a deep-in-the-money American put option early. This means that there are some situations where a short-maturity European put option is more valuable than a similar long-maturity European put option.

# Volatility

The precise way in which volatility is defined is explained in Chapter 15. Roughly speaking, the volatility of a stock price is a measure of how uncertain we are about future stock price movements. As volatility increases, the chance that the stock will do very well or very poorly increases. For the owner of a stock, these two outcomes tend to offset each other. However, this is not so for the owner of a call or put. The owner of a

(d) call benefits from price increases but has limited downside risk in the event of price decreases because the most the owner can lose is the price of the option. Similarly, the owner of a put benefits from price decreases, but has limited downside risk in the event of price increases. The values of both calls and puts therefore increase as volatility increases (see Figure 11.2a, b).


# Risk-Free Interest Rate

The risk-free interest rate affects the price of an option in a less clear-cut way. As interest rates in the economy increase, the expected return required by investors from the stock tends to increase. In addition, the present value of any future cash flow received by the holder of the option decreases. The combined impact of these two effects is to increase the value of call options and decrease the value of put options (see Figure 11.2c, d).

It is important to emphasize that we are assuming that interest rates change while all other variables stay the same. In particular we are assuming in Table 11.1 that interest rates change while the stock price remains the same. In practice, when interest rates rise

(fall), stock prices tend to fall (rise). The combined effect of an interest rate increase and the accompanying stock price decrease can be to decrease the value of a call option and increase the value of a put option. Similarly, the combined effect of an interest rate decrease and the accompanying stock price increase can be to increase the value of a call option and decrease the value of a put option.

# Amount of Future Dividends

Dividends have the effect of reducing the stock price on the ex-dividend date. This is bad news for the value of call options and good news for the value of put options. Consider a dividend whose ex-dividend date is during the life of an option. The value of the option is negatively related to the size of the dividend if the option is a call and positively related to the size of the dividend if the option is a put.

# 11.2 ASSUMPTIONS AND NOTATION

In this chapter, we will make assumptions similar to those made when deriving forward and futures prices in Chapter 5. We assume that there are some market participants, such as large investment banks, for which the following statements are true:

1. There are no transaction costs.
2. All trading profits (net of trading losses) are subject to the same tax rate.
3. Borrowing and lending are possible at the risk-free interest rate.

We assume that these market participants are prepared to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities as they arise. As discussed in Chapters 1 and 5, this means that any available arbitrage opportunities disappear very quickly. For the purposes of our analysis, it is therefore reasonable to assume that there are no arbitrage opportunities.

We will use the following notation:

$S_0$ : Current stock price
$K$ : Strike price of option
$T$ : Time to expiration of option

$S_{T}$ : Stock price on the expiration date

$r$ : Continuously compounded risk-free rate of interest for an investment maturing in time  $T$
C: Value of American call option to buy one share
$P$ : Value of American put option to sell one share
$c$ : Value of European call option to buy one share
$p$ : Value of European put option to sell one share

It should be noted that  $r$  is the nominal risk-free rate of interest, not the real risk-free rate of interest. The proxies used by the market for the risk-free rate of interest were discussed in Chapter 4. A simple arbitrage argument suggests that  $r > 0$  and this is the assumption we make in deriving results in this chapter. However, during some periods the monetary policies of governments have led to interest rates being negative in some currencies such as the euro, Swiss franc, and Japanese yen. Problem 11.27 considers the impact of negative interest rates on the results in this chapter.


# 11.3 UPPER AND LOWER BOUNDS FOR OPTION PRICES

In this section, we derive upper and lower bounds for option prices. These bounds do not depend on any particular assumptions about the factors mentioned in Section 11.1 (except  $r > 0$ ). If an option price is above the upper bound or below the lower bound, then there are profitable opportunities for arbitrageurs.

# Upper Bounds

An American or European call option gives the holder the right to buy one share of a stock for a certain price. No matter what happens, the option can never be worth more than the stock. Hence, the stock price is an upper bound to the option price:

$$ c \leq S _ {0} \quad \text {a n d} \quad C \leq S _ {0} \tag {11.1}
$$

If these relationships were not true, an arbitrageur could easily make a riskless profit by buying the stock and selling the call option.

An American put option gives the holder the right to sell one share of a stock for  $K$ . No matter how low the stock price becomes, the option can never be worth more than  $K$ . Hence,

$$
P \leq K \tag {11.2}
$$

For European options, we know that at maturity the option cannot be worth more than  $K$ . It follows that it cannot be worth more than the present value of  $K$  today:

$$ p \leq K e ^ {- r T} \tag {11.3}
$$

If this were not true, an arbitrageur could make a riskless profit by writing the option and investing the proceeds of the sale at the risk-free interest rate.

# Lower Bound for Calls on Non-Dividend-Paying Stocks

A lower bound for the price of a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock is

$$
S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T}
$$

We first look at a numerical example and then consider a more formal argument.

Suppose that  $S_0 = \20, K = \$ 18, r = 10\%  per annum, and  $T = 1$  year. In this case,

$$
S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T} = 2 0 - 1 8 e ^ {- 0. 1} = 3. 7 1
$$ or  $3.71. Consider the situation where the European call price is$ 3.00, which is less than the theoretical minimum of 3.71. An arbitrageur can short the stock and buy the


call to provide a cash inflow of $20.00 - $3.00 = $17.00. If invested for 1 year at 10\% per annum, the $17.00 grows to 17e^0.1×1 = $18.79. At the end of the year, the option expires. If the stock price is greater than $18.00, the arbitrageur exercises the option paying 18.00 for the stock and uses the stock to close out the short position. This leads to a profit of

$$

\$ 18.79 - \$ 18.00 = \$ 0.79

$$

If the stock price is less than $18.00, the stock is bought in the market and the short position is closed out. The arbitrageur then makes an even greater profit. For example, if the stock price is $17.00, the arbitrageur's profit is

$$

\$ 18.79 - \$ 17.00 = \$ 1.79

$$

For a more formal argument, we consider the following two portfolios:

Portfolio A: one European call option plus a zero-coupon bond that provides a payoff of  $K$  at time  $T$

Portfolio B: one share of the stock.

In portfolio A, the zero-coupon bond will be worth  $K$  at time  $T$ . If  $S_{T} > K$ , the call option is exercised at maturity and portfolio A is worth  $S_{T}$ . If  $S_{T} < K$ , the call option expires worthless and the portfolio is worth  $K$ . Hence, at time  $T$ , portfolio A is worth

$$

\max  \left(S _ {T}, K\right)

$$

Portfolio B is worth  $S_{T}$  at time  $T$ . Hence, portfolio A is always worth as much as, and can be worth more than, portfolio B at the option's maturity. It follows that in the absence of arbitrage opportunities this must also be true today. The zero-coupon bond is worth  $Ke^{-rT}$  today. Hence,

$$ c + K e ^ {- r T} \geq S _ {0}
$$ or


$$ c \geq S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T}
$$

Because the worst that can happen to a call option is that it expires worthless, its value cannot be negative. This means that  $c \geq 0$ , so that

$$ c \geq \max  \left(S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T}, 0\right) \tag {11.4}
$$

# Example 11.1

Consider a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock when the stock price is  $51, the strike price is$ 50, the time to maturity is 6 months, and the risk-free interest rate is 12\% per annum. In this case,  $S_0 = 51$ ,  $K = 50$ ,  $T = 0.5$ , and  $r = 0.12$ . From equation (11.4), a lower bound for the option price is  $S_0 - Ke^{-rT}$ , or

$$
5 1 - 5 0 e ^ {- 0. 1 2 \times 0. 5} = \$ 3. 9 1
$$

# Lower Bound for European Puts on Non-Dividend-Paying Stocks

For a European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock, a lower bound for the price is

$$
K e ^ {- r T} - S _ {0}
$$

Again, we first consider a numerical example and then look at a more formal argument.

Suppose that  $S_0 = \$ 37, K = \ $40, r = 5\%$  per annum, and  $T = 0.5$  years. In this case,

$$
K e ^ {- r T} - S _ {0} = 4 0 e ^ {- 0. 0 5 \times 0. 5} - 3 7 = \$ 2. 0 1
$$

Consider the situation where the European put price is $1.00, which is less than the theoretical minimum of $2.01. An arbitrageur can borrow $38.00 for 6 months to buy both the put and the stock. At the end of the 6 months, the arbitrageur will be required to repay 38e^0.05  $\times$  0.5 = $38.96. If the stock price is below $40.00, the arbitrageur exercises the option to sell the stock for $40.00, repays the loan, and makes a profit of

$$
\$ 40.00 - \$ 38.96 = \$ 1.04
$$

If the stock price is greater than $40.00, the arbitrageur discards the option, sells the stock, and repays the loan for an even greater profit. For example, if the stock price is $42.00, the arbitrageur's profit is

$$
\$ 42.00 - \$ 38.96 = \$ 3.04
$$

For a more formal argument, we consider the following two portfolios:

Portfolio  $C$ : one European put option plus one share

Portfolio  $D$ : a zero-coupon bond paying off  $K$  at time  $T$ .

If  $S_{T} < K$ , then the option in portfolio  $C$  is exercised at option maturity and the portfolio becomes worth  $K$ . If  $S_{T} > K$ , then the put option expires worthless and the portfolio is worth  $S_{T}$  at this time. Hence, portfolio  $C$  is worth

$$
\max  (S _ {T}, K)
$$ at time  $T$ . Portfolio D is worth  $K$  at time  $T$ . Hence, portfolio C is always worth as much as, and can sometimes be worth more than, portfolio D at time  $T$ . It follows that in the absence of arbitrage opportunities portfolio C must be worth at least as much as portfolio D today. Hence,


$$ p + S _ {0} \geq K e ^ {- r T}
$$ or


$$ p \geq K e ^ {- r T} - S _ {0}
$$

Because the worst that can happen to a put option is that it expires worthless, its value cannot be negative. This means that

$$ p \geq \max  \left(K e ^ {- r T} - S _ {0}, 0\right) \tag {11.5}
$$

# Example 11.2

Consider a European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock when the stock price is  $38, the strike price is$ 40, the time to maturity is 3 months, and the risk-free rate of interest is 10\% per annum. In this case  $S_0 = 38$ ,  $K = 40$ ,  $T = 0.25$ , and  $r = 0.10$ . From equation (11.5), a lower bound for the option price is  $Ke^{-rT} - S_0$ , or  $40e^{-0.1 \times 0.25} - 38 =$ 1.01.

# 11.4 PUT-CALL PARITY

We now derive an important relationship between the prices of European put and call options that have the same strike price and time to maturity. Consider the following two portfolios that were used in the previous section:

Portfolio A: one European call option plus a zero-coupon bond that provides a payoff of  $K$  at time  $T$

Portfolio  $C$ : one European put option plus one share of the stock.

We continue to assume that the stock pays no dividends. The call and put options have the same strike price  $K$  and the same time to maturity  $T$ .

As discussed in the previous section, the zero-coupon bond in portfolio A will be worth  $K$  at time  $T$ . If the stock price  $S_{T}$  at time  $T$  proves to be above  $K$ , then the call option in portfolio A will be exercised. This means that portfolio A is worth  $(S_{T} - K) + K = S_{T}$  at time  $T$  in these circumstances. If  $S_{T}$  proves to be less than  $K$ , then the call option in portfolio A will expire worthless and the portfolio will be worth  $K$  at time  $T$ .

In portfolio C, the share will be worth  $S_{T}$  at time  $T$ . If  $S_{T}$  proves to be below  $K$ , then the put option in portfolio C will be exercised. This means that portfolio C is worth  $(K - S_{T}) + S_{T} = K$  at time  $T$  in these circumstances. If  $S_{T}$  proves to be greater than  $K$ , then the put option in portfolio C will expire worthless and the portfolio will be worth  $S_{T}$  at time  $T$ .

The situation is summarized in Table 11.2. If  $S_{T} > K$ , both portfolios are worth  $S_{T}$  at time  $T$ ; if  $S_{T} < K$ , both portfolios are worth  $K$  at time  $T$ . In other words, both are worth

$$
\max  (S _ {T}, K)
$$ when the options expire at time  $T$ . Because they are European, the options cannot be exercised prior to time  $T$ . Since the portfolios have identical values at time  $T$ , they must have identical values today. If this were not the case, an arbitrageur could buy the less expensive portfolio and sell the more expensive one. Because the portfolios are guaranteed to cancel each other out at time  $T$ , this trading strategy would lock in an arbitrage profit equal to the difference in the values of the two portfolios.


The components of portfolio A are worth  $c$  and  $Ke^{-rT}$  today, and the components of

Table 11.2 Portfolios illustrating put-call parity.

<table><tr><td></td><td></td><td>ST&gt;KT</td><td>ST&lt;KT</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Portfolio A</td><td>Call option</td><td>ST-K</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Zero-coupon bond</td><td>K</td><td>K</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>ST</td><td>K</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Portfolio C</td><td>Put Option</td><td>0</td><td>K-ST</td></tr><tr><td>Share</td><td>ST</td><td>ST</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>ST</td><td>K</td></tr></table> portfolio  $C$  are worth  $p$  and  $S_0$  today. Hence,


$$ c + K e ^ {- r T} = p + S _ {0} \tag {11.6}
$$

This relationship is known as put-call parity. It shows that the value of a European call with a certain exercise price and exercise date can be deduced from the value of a European put with the same exercise price and exercise date, and vice versa.

To illustrate the arbitrage opportunities when equation (11.6) does not hold, suppose that the stock price is  $31, the exercise price is$ 30, the risk-free interest rate is 10\% per annum, the price of a three-month European call option is $3, and the price of a 3-month European put option is $2.25. In this case,

$$ c + K e ^ {- r T} = 3 + 3 0 e ^ {- 0. 1 \times 3 / 1 2} = \$ 3 2. 2 6

$$

$$ p + S _ {0} = 2. 2 5 + 3 1 = \$ 3 3. 2 5
$$

Portfolio C is overpriced relative to portfolio A. An arbitrageur can buy the securities in portfolio A and short the securities in portfolio C. The strategy involves buying the call and shorting both the put and the stock, generating a positive cash flow of

$$
- 3 + 2. 2 5 + 3 1 = \$ 3 0. 2 5
$$ up front. When invested at the risk-free interest rate, this amount grows to


$$

3 0. 2 5 e ^ {0. 1 \times 0. 2 5} = \\ 3 1. 0 2

$$ in three months. If the stock price at expiration of the option is greater than  $30, the call will be exercised. If it is less than$ 30, the put will be exercised. In either case, the arbitrageur ends up buying one share for 30. This share can be used to close out the short position. The net profit is therefore

$$
\$ 31.02 - \$ 30.00 = \$ 1.02
$$

For an alternative situation, suppose that the call price is $3 and the put price is $1. In this case,

$$ c + K e ^ {- r T} = 3 + 3 0 e ^ {- 0. 1 \times 3 / 1 2} = \$ 3 2. 2 6

$$

$$ p + S _ {0} = 1 + 3 1 = \$ 3 2. 0 0
$$

Portfolio A is overpriced relative to portfolio C. An arbitrageur can short the securities in portfolio A and buy the securities in portfolio C to lock in a profit. The strategy involves shorting the call and buying both the put and the stock with an initial investment of

$$
\$ 31 + \$ 1 - \$ 3 = \$ 2 9
$$

When the investment is financed at the risk-free interest rate, a repayment of 29e^0.1×0.25 = $29.73 is required at the end of the three months. As in the previous case, either the call or the put will be exercised. The short call and long put option position therefore leads to the stock being sold for $30.00. The net profit is therefore

$$
\$ 30.00 - \$ 29.73 = \$ 0.27
$$

These examples are illustrated in Table 11.3. Business Snapshot 11.1 shows how options and put-call parity can help us understand the positions of the debt holders and equity holders in a company.

Table 11.3 Arbitrage opportunities when put-call parity does not hold. Stock price = $31; interest rate = 10\%; call price = $3. Both put and call have strike price of 30 and three months to maturity.

# American Options

Put-call parity holds only for European options. However, it is possible to derive some results for American option prices. It can be shown (see Problem 11.23) that, when there are no dividends,

$$
S _ {0} - K \leq C - P \leq S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T} \tag {11.7}
$$

# Example 11.3

An American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock with strike price 20.00 and maturity in 5 months is worth 1.50. Suppose that the current stock price is 19.00 and the risk-free interest rate is 10\% per annum. From equation (11.7), we have

$$
1 9 - 2 0 \leq C - P \leq 1 9 - 2 0 e ^ {- 0. 1 \times 5 / 1 2}
$$ or


$$

1 \geq P - C \geq 0. 1 8

$$ showing that P - C lies between $0.18 and $1.00. With C at $1.50, P must lie between $1.68 and $2.50. In other words, upper and lower bounds for the price of an American put with the same strike price and expiration date as the American call are $2.50 and 1.68.

# 11.5 CALLS ON A NON-DIVIDEND-PAYING STOCK

In this section, we first show that it is never optimal to exercise an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock before the expiration date.

To illustrate the general nature of the argument, consider an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock with one month to expiration when the stock price is 70

# Business Snapshot 11.1 Put-Call Parity and Capital Structure

Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton were the pioneers of option pricing. In the early 1970s, they also showed that options can be used to characterize the capital structure of a company. Today this analysis is widely used by financial institutions to assess a company's credit risk.

To illustrate the analysis, consider a simple situation where a company has assets that are financed with zero-coupon bonds and equity. The bonds mature in five years at which time a principal payment of  $K$  is required. The company pays no dividends. If the assets are worth more than  $K$  in five years, the equity holders choose to repay the bond holders. If the assets are worth less than  $K$ , the equity holders choose to declare bankruptcy and the bond holders end up owning the company.

The value of the equity in five years is therefore  $\max (A_T - K, 0)$ , where  $A_T$  is the value of the company's assets at that time. This shows that the equity holders have a five-year European call option on the assets of the company with a strike price of  $K$ . What about the bond holders? They get  $\min (A_T, K)$  in five years. This is the same as  $K - \max (K - A_T, 0)$ , so that today the bonds are worth the present value of  $K$  minus the value of a five-year European put option on the assets with a strike price of  $K$ .

To summarize, if  $c$  and  $p$  are the values, respectively, of five-year call and put options on the company's assets with strike price  $K$ , then

$$
\text {V a l u e o f c o m p a n y s} = c
$$

$$
\text {V a l u e} = P V (K) - p
$$

Denote the value of the assets of the company today by  $A_0$ . The value of the assets must equal the total value of the instruments used to finance the assets. This means that it must equal the sum of the value of the equity and the value of the debt, so that

$$
A _ {0} = c + \left[ P V (K) - p \right]
$$

Rearranging this equation, we have

$$ c + P V (K) = p + A _ {0}
$$

This is the put-call parity result in equation (11.6) for call and put options on the assets of the company.

and the strike price is $40. The option is deep in the money, and the investor who owns the option might well be tempted to exercise it immediately. However, if the investor plans to hold the stock obtained by exercising the option for more than one month, this is not the best strategy. A better course of action is to keep the option and exercise it at the end of the month. The $40 strike price is then paid out one month later than it would be if the option were exercised immediately, so that interest is earned on the $40 for one month. Because the stock pays no dividends, no income from the stock is sacrificed. A further advantage of waiting rather than exercising immediately is that there is some chance (however remote) that the stock price will fall below $40 in one month. In this case the investor will not exercise in one month and will be glad that the decision to exercise early was not taken!

This argument shows that there are no advantages to exercising early if the investor plans to keep the stock for the remaining life of the option (one month, in this case). What if the investor thinks the stock is currently overpriced and is wondering whether to exercise the option and sell the stock? In this case, the investor is better off selling the option than exercising it. The option will be bought by another investor who does want to hold the stock. Such investors must exist. Otherwise the current stock price would not be $70. The price obtained for the option will be greater than its intrinsic value of $30, for the reasons mentioned earlier.

For a more formal argument, we can use equation (11.4):

$$ c \geq S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T}
$$

Because the owner of an American call has all the exercise opportunities open to the owner of the corresponding European call, we must have  $C \geq c$ . Hence,

$$
C \geq S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T}
$$

Given  $r > 0$ , it follows that  $C > S_0 - K$  when  $T > 0$ . This means that  $C$  is always greater than the option's intrinsic value prior to maturity. If it were optimal to exercise at a particular time prior to maturity,  $C$  would equal the option's intrinsic value at that time. It follows that it can never be optimal to exercise early.

To summarize, there are two reasons an American call on a non-dividend-paying stock should not be exercised early. One relates to the insurance that it provides. A call option, when held instead of the stock itself, in effect insures the holder against the stock price falling below the strike price. Once the option has been exercised and the strike price has been exchanged for the stock price, this insurance vanishes. The other reason concerns the time value of money. From the perspective of the option holder, the later the strike price is paid out the better.

# Bounds

Because American call options are never exercised early when there are no dividends, they are equivalent to European call options, so that  $C = c$ . From equations (11.1) and (11.4), it follows that lower and upper bounds for both  $c$  and  $C$  are given by

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/0b4b24a3ca6a1d8a0d80f1d8fb57515b53a08cd2e19b4a9fa0922f086bf11926.jpg)

$$
\max  \left(S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T}, 0\right) \quad \text {a n d} \quad S _ {0}
$$ respectively. These bounds are illustrated in Figure 11.3.


The general way in which the call price varies with the stock price,  $S_0$ , is shown in Figure 11.4. As  $r$  or  $T$  or the stock price volatility increases, the line relating the call price to the stock price moves in the direction indicated by the arrows.

# 11.6 PUTS ON A NON-DIVIDEND-PAYING STOCK

It can be optimal to exercise an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock early. Indeed, at any given time during its life, the put option should always be exercised early if it is sufficiently deep in the money.

To illustrate, consider an extreme situation. Suppose that the strike price is $10 and the stock price is virtually zero. By exercising immediately, an investor makes an immediate gain of $10. If the investor waits, the gain from exercise might be less than $10, but it cannot be more than $10, because negative stock prices are impossible. Furthermore, assuming the interest rate is positive, receiving $10 now is preferable to receiving $10 in the future. It follows that the option should be exercised immediately.

Like a call option, a put option can be viewed as providing insurance. A put option, when held in conjunction with the stock, insures the holder against the stock price falling below a certain level. However, a put option is different from a call option in that it may be optimal for an investor to forgo this insurance and exercise early in order to realize the strike price immediately. In general, the early exercise of a put option becomes more attractive as  $S_{0}$  decreases, as  $r$  increases, and as the volatility decreases.

# Bounds

From equations (11.3) and (11.5), lower and upper bounds for a European put option when there are no dividends are given by

$$

\max  \left(K e ^ {- r T} - S _ {0}, 0\right) \leq p \leq K e ^ {- r T}

$$

For an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock, the condition

$$

P \geq \max  (K - S _ {0}, 0)

$$ must apply because the option can be exercised at any time. This is a stronger condition than the one for a European put option in equation (11.5). Using the result in equation (11.2), bounds for an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock are


$$

\max  (K - S _ {0}, 0) \leq P \leq K

$$

Figure 11.5 illustrates the bounds.

Figure 11.6 shows the general way in which the price of an American put option varies with  $S_0$ . As we argued earlier, provided that  $r > 0$ , it is always optimal to exercise an American put immediately when the stock price is sufficiently low. When early exercise is optimal, the value of the option is  $K - S_0$ . The curve representing the value of the put therefore merges into the put's intrinsic value,  $K - S_0$ , for a sufficiently small value of  $S_0$ . In Figure 11.6, this value of  $S_0$  is shown as point A. The line relating the put price to the stock price moves in the direction indicated by the arrows when  $r$  decreases, when the volatility increases, and when  $T$  increases.

Because there are some circumstances when it is desirable to exercise an American put option early, it follows that an American put option is always worth more than the corresponding European put option. Furthermore, because an American put is sometimes worth its intrinsic value (see Figure 11.6), it follows that a European put option must sometimes be worth less than its intrinsic value. This means that the curve representing the relationship between the put price and the stock price for a European option must be below the corresponding curve for an American option.

Figure 11.7 shows the variation of the European put price with the stock price. Note that point B in Figure 11.7, at which the price of the option is equal to its intrinsic value, must represent a higher value of the stock price than point A in Figure 11.6 because the curve in Figure 11.7 is below that in Figure 11.6. Point E in Figure 11.7 is where  $S_0 = 0$  and the European put price is  $Ke^{-rT}$ .

# 11.7 EFFECT OF DIVIDENDS

The results produced so far in this chapter have assumed that we are dealing with options on a non-dividend-paying stock. In this section, we examine the impact of dividends. We assume that the dividends that will be paid during the life of the option are known. In many situations, this assumption is often not too unreasonable. We will use  $D$  to denote the present value of the dividends during the life of the option. In the calculation of  $D$ , a dividend is assumed to occur at the time of its ex-dividend date.

# Lower Bound for Calls and Puts

We can redefine portfolios A and B as follows:

Portfolio A: one European call option plus an amount of cash equal to  $D + Ke^{-rT}$

Portfolio B: one share

A similar argument to the one used to derive equation (11.4) shows that

$$ c \geq \max  \left(S _ {0} - D - K e ^ {- r T}, 0\right) \tag {11.8}
$$

We can also redefine portfolios C and D as follows:

Portfolio  $C$ : one European put option plus one share

Portfolio  $D$ : an amount of cash equal to  $D + Ke^{-rT}$

A similar argument to the one used to derive equation (11.5) shows that

$$ p \geq \max  (D + K e ^ {- r T} - S _ {0}, 0) \tag {11.9}
$$

# Early Exercise

When dividends are expected, we can no longer assert that an American call option will not be exercised early. Sometimes it is optimal to exercise an American call immediately prior to an ex-dividend date. It is never optimal to exercise a call at other times. This point is discussed further in Section 15.12.

# Put-Call Parity

Comparing the value at option maturity of the redefined portfolios A and C shows that, with dividends, the put-call parity result in equation (11.6) becomes

$$ c + D + K e ^ {- r T} = p + S _ {0} \tag {11.10}
$$

Dividends cause equation (11.7) to be modified (see Problem 11.24) to

$$
S _ {0} - D - K \leq C - P \leq S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T} \tag {11.11}
$$

# SUMMARY

There are six factors affecting the value of a stock option: the current stock price, the strike price, the time to expiration, the stock price volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and the dividends expected during the life of the option. The value of a call usually increases as the current stock price, the time to expiration, the volatility, and the risk-free interest rate increase. The value of a call decreases as the strike price and expected dividends increase. The value of a put usually increases as the strike price, the time to expiration, the volatility, and the expected dividends increase. The value of a put decreases as the current stock price and the risk-free interest rate increase.

It is possible to reach some conclusions about the value of stock options without making any assumptions about the volatility of stock prices. For example, the price of a call option on a stock must always be worth less than the price of the stock itself. Similarly, the price of a put option on a stock must always be worth less than the option's strike price.

A European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock must be worth more than

$$
\max  \left(S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T}, 0\right)
$$ where  $S_0$  is the stock price,  $K$  is the strike price,  $r$  is the risk-free interest rate, and  $T$  is the time to expiration. A European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock must be worth more than


$$

\max  \left(K e ^ {- r T} - S _ {0}, 0\right)

$$

When dividends with present value  $D$  will be paid, the lower bound for a European call option becomes

$$

\max  \left(S _ {0} - D - K e ^ {- r T}, 0\right)

$$ and the lower bound for a European put option becomes


$$

\max  \left(K e ^ {- r T} + D - S _ {0}, 0\right)

$$

Put-call parity is a relationship between the price,  $c$ , of a European call option on a stock and the price,  $p$ , of a European put option on a stock. For a non-dividend-paying stock, it is

$$ c + K e ^ {- r T} = p + S _ {0}
$$

For a dividend-paying stock, the put-call parity relationship is

$$ c + D + K e ^ {- r T} = p + S _ {0}
$$

Put-call parity does not hold for American options. However, it is possible to use arbitrage arguments to obtain upper and lower bounds for the difference between the price of an American call and the price of an American put.

In Chapter 15, we will carry the analyses in this chapter further by making specific assumptions about the probabilistic behavior of stock prices. The analysis will enable us to derive exact pricing formulas for European stock options. In Chapters 13 and 21, we will see how numerical procedures can be used to price American options.

# 12 CHAPTER

# Trading Strategies Involving Options

We discussed the profit pattern from an investment in a single option in Chapter 10. In this chapter we look at what can be achieved when an option is traded in conjunction with other assets. In particular, we examine the properties of portfolios consisting of (a) an option and a zero-coupon bond, (b) an option and the asset underlying the option, and (c) two or more options on the same asset.

A natural question is why a trader would want the profit patterns discussed here. The answer is that the choices a trader makes depend on the trader's judgment about how prices will move and the trader's willingness to take risks. Principal-protected notes, discussed in Section 12.1 appeal to individuals who are risk-averse. They do not want to risk losing their principal, but have an opinion about whether a particular asset will increase or decrease in value and are prepared to let the return they earn on this principal depend on whether they are right. If a trader is willing to take rather more risk than this, he or she could choose a bull or bear spread, discussed in Section 12.3. Yet more risk would be taken with a straightforward long position in a call or put option.

Suppose that a trader feels there will be a big move in price of an asset, but does not know whether this will be up or down. There are a number of alternative trading strategies. A risk-averse trader might choose a reverse butterfly spread, discussed in Section 12.3, where there will be a small gain if the trader's hunch is correct and a small loss if it is not. A more aggressive investor might choose a straddle or strangle, discussed in Section 12.4, where potential gains and losses are larger.

Further trading strategies involving options are considered in later chapters. For example, Chapter 17 shows how options on stock indices can be used to manage the risks in a stock portfolio and explains how range forward contracts can be used to hedge a foreign exchange exposure; Chapter 19 covers the way in which Greek letters are used to manage the risks when derivatives are traded; Chapter 26 covers exotic options and what is known as static options replication.

# 12.1 PRINCIPAL-PROTECTED NOTES

Options are often used to create what are termed principal-protected notes for the retail market. These are products that appeal to conservative investors. The return earned by the investor depends on the performance of a stock, a stock index, or other risky asset, but the initial principal amount invested is not at risk. An example will illustrate how a simple principal-protected note can be created.

# Example 12.1

Suppose that the 3-year interest rate is  $6\%$  with continuous compounding. This means that  $1,000e^{-0.06 \times 3} = \835.27$  will grow to \1,000 in 3 years. The difference between \ $1,000 and \$ 835.27 is \ $164.73. Suppose that a stock portfolio is worth \$ 1,000 and provides a dividend yield of  $1.5\%$  per annum. Suppose further that a 3-year at-the-money European call option on the stock portfolio can be purchased for less than \164.73. (From DerivaGem, it can be verified that this will be the case if the volatility of the value of the portfolio is less than about  $15\%$ .) A bank can offer clients a \1,000 investment opportunity consisting of:

1. A 3-year zero-coupon bond with a principal of 1,000
2. A 3-year at-the-money European call option on the stock portfolio.

If the value of the portfolio increases the investor gets whatever $1,000 invested in the portfolio would have grown to. (This is because the zero-coupon bond pays off $1,000 and this equals the strike price of the option.) If the value of the portfolio goes down, the option has no value, but payoff from the zero-coupon bond ensures that the investor receives the original 1,000 principal invested.

The attraction of a principal-protected note is that an investor is able to take a risky position without risking any principal. The worst that can happen is that the investor loses the chance to earn interest, or other income such as dividends, on the initial investment for the life of the note.

There are many variations on the product in Example 12.1. An investor who thinks that the price of an asset will decline can buy a principal-protected note consisting of a zero-coupon bond plus a put option. The investor's payoff in 3 years is then 1,000 plus the payoff (if any) from the put option.

Is a principal-protected note a good deal from the retail investor's perspective? A bank will always build in a profit for itself when it creates a principal-protected note. This means that, in Example 12.1, the zero-coupon bond plus the call option will always cost the bank less than 1,000. In addition, investors are taking the risk that the bank will not be in a position to make the payoff on the principal-protected note at maturity. (Some retail investors lost money on principal-protected notes created by Lehman Brothers when it failed in 2008.) In some situations, therefore, an investor will be better off if he or she buys the underlying option in the usual way and invests the remaining principal in a risk-free investment. However, this is not always the case. The investor is likely to face wider bid-ask spreads on the option than the bank and is likely to earn lower interest rates than the bank. It is therefore possible that the bank can add value for the investor while making a profit itself.

Now let us look at the principal-protected notes from the perspective of the bank. The economic viability of the structure in Example 12.1 depends critically on the level of interest rates and the volatility of the portfolio. If the interest rate is  $3\%$  instead of  $6\%$ , the bank has only  $1,000 - 1,000e^{-0.03 \times 3} = \86.07$  with which to buy the call option. If interest rates are  $6\%$ , but the volatility is  $25\%$  instead of  $15\%$ , the price of the option would be about \221. In either of these circumstances, the product described in Example 12.1 cannot be profitably created by the bank. However, there are a number of ways the bank can still create a viable 3-year product. For example, the strike price of the option can be increased so that the value of the portfolio has to rise by, say,  $15\%$  before the investor makes a gain; the investor's return could be capped; the return of the investor could depend on the average price of the asset instead of the final price; a knockout barrier could be specified. The derivatives involved in some of these alternatives will be discussed later in the book. (Capping the option corresponds to the creation of a bull spread for the investor and will be discussed later in this chapter.)

One way in which a bank can sometimes create a profitable principal-protected note when interest rates are low or volatilities are high is by increasing its life. Consider the situation in Example 12.1 when (a) the interest rate is 3\% rather than 6\% and (b) the stock portfolio has a volatility of 15\% and provides a dividend yield of 1.5\%. DerivaGem shows that a 3-year at-the-money European option costs about 119. This is more than the funds available to purchase it (1,000 - 1,000e^{-0.03\times 3} = \86.07). A 10-year at-the-money option costs about \217. This is less than the funds available to purchase it (1,000 - 1,000e^{-0.03\times 10} = \259.18), making the structure profitable. When the life is increased to 20 years, the option cost is about \281, which is much less than the funds available to purchase it (1,000 - 1,000e^{-0.03\times 20} = \451.19), so that the structure is even more profitable.

A critical variable for the bank in our example is the dividend yield. The higher it is, the more profitable the product is for the bank. If the dividend yield were zero, the principal-protected note in Example 12.1 cannot be profitable for the bank no matter how long it lasts. (This follows from equation (11.4).)

# 12.2 TRADING AN OPTION AND THE UNDERLYING ASSET

For convenience, we will assume that the asset underlying the options considered in the rest of the chapter is a stock. (Similar trading strategies can be developed for other underlying assets.) We will also follow the usual practice of calculating the profit from a trading strategy as the final payoff minus the initial cost without any discounting.

There are a number of different trading strategies involving a single option on a stock and the stock itself. The profits from these are illustrated in Figure 12.1. In this figure and in other figures throughout this chapter, the dashed line shows the relationship between profit and the stock price for the individual securities constituting the portfolio, whereas the solid line shows the relationship between profit and the stock price for the whole portfolio.

In Figure 12.1a, the portfolio consists of a long position in a stock plus a short position in a European call option. This is known as writing a covered call. The long stock position "covers" or protects the investor from the payoff on the short call that becomes necessary if there is a sharp rise in the stock price. In Figure 12.1b, a short position in a stock is combined with a long position in a call option. This is the reverse of writing a covered call. In Figure 12.1c, the investment strategy involves buying a European put option on a stock and the stock itself. This is referred to as a protective put strategy. In Figure 12.1d, a short position in a put option is combined with a short position in the stock. This is the reverse of a protective put.

The profit patterns in Figures 12.1a, b, c, and d have the same general shape as the profit patterns discussed in Chapter 10 for short put, long put, long call, and short call,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/186f8c1f752f68c30c9646ac28e5abd41e7ac28725c28ae7400c8d8cf92cf047.jpg)

(d) respectively. Put-call parity provides a way of understanding why this is so. From Chapter 11, the put-call parity relationship is

$$ p + S _ {0} = c + K e ^ {- r T} + D \tag {12.1}
$$ where  $p$  is the price of a European put,  $S_0$  is the stock price,  $c$  is the price of a European call,  $K$  is the strike price of both call and put,  $r$  is the risk-free interest rate,  $T$  is the time to maturity of both call and put, and  $D$  is the present value of the dividends anticipated during the life of the options.


Equation (12.1) shows that a long position in a European put combined with a long position in the stock is equivalent to a long European call position plus a certain amount  $(= Ke^{-rT} + D)$  of cash. This explains why the profit pattern in Figure 12.1c is similar to the profit pattern from a long call position. The position in Figure 12.1d is the reverse of that in Figure 12.1c and therefore leads to a profit pattern similar to that from a short call position.

Equation (12.1) can be rearranged to become

$$

S _ {0} - c = K e ^ {- r T} + D - p

$$

This shows that a long position in a stock combined with a short position in a European call is equivalent to a short European put position plus a certain amount  $(= Ke^{-rT} + D)$  of cash. This equality explains why the profit pattern in Figure 12.1a is similar to the profit pattern from a short put position. The position in Figure 12.1b is the reverse of that in Figure 12.1a and therefore leads to a profit pattern similar to that from a long put position.

# 12.3 SPREADS

A spread trading strategy involves taking a position in two or more options of the same type (i.e., two or more calls or two or more puts).

# Bull Spreads

One of the most popular types of spreads is a bull spread. This can be created by buying a European call option on a stock with a certain strike price and selling a European call option on the same stock with a higher strike price. Both options have the same expiration date. The strategy is illustrated in Figure 12.2. The profits from the two option positions taken separately are shown by the dashed lines. The profit from the whole strategy is the sum of the profits given by the dashed lines and is indicated by the solid line. Because a call price always decreases as the strike price increases, the value of the option sold is always less than the value of the option bought. A bull spread, when created from calls, therefore requires an initial investment.

Suppose that  $K_{1}$  is the strike price of the call option bought,  $K_{2}$  is the strike price of

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/b5937894b6f8bfcb687010ae22408af53ca9eee25fd38e3b7e140bbcd3c648d9.jpg)

Table 12.1 shows the total payoff that will be realized from a bull spread in different circumstances. If the stock price does well and is greater than the higher strike price, the payoff is the difference between the two strike prices, or  $K_{2} - K_{1}$ . If the stock price on the expiration date lies between the two strike prices, the payoff is  $S_{T} - K_{1}$ . If the stock price on the expiration date is below the lower strike price, the payoff is zero. The profit in Figure 12.2 is calculated by subtracting the initial investment from the payoff.


A bull spread strategy limits the investor's upside as well as downside risk. The strategy can be described by saying that the investor has a call option with a strike price equal to  $K_{1}$  and has chosen to give up some upside potential by selling a call option with strike price  $K_{2}$  ( $K_{2} > K_{1}$ ). In return for giving up the upside potential, the investor gets the price of the option with strike price  $K_{2}$ . Three types of bull spreads can be distinguished:

1. Both calls are initially out of the money.
2. One call is initially in the money; the other call is initially out of the money.
3. Both calls are initially in the money.

The most aggressive bull spreads are those of type 1. They cost very little to set up and have a small probability of giving a relatively high payoff  $(= K_{2} - K_{1})$ . As we move from type 1 to type 2 and from type 2 to type 3, the spreads become more conservative.

# Example 12.2

An investor buys for $3 a 3-month European call with a strike price of $30 and sells for $1 a 3-month European call with a strike price of $35. The payoff from this bull spread strategy is $5 if the stock price is above $35, and zero if it is below $30. If the stock price is between $30 and $35, the payoff is the amount by which the stock price exceeds $30. The cost of the strategy is $3 - $1 = 2. So the profit is:

<table><tr><td>Stock price range</td><td>Profit</td></tr><tr><td>ST≤30</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>30 &lt; ST &lt; 35</td><td>ST-32</td></tr><tr><td>ST≥35</td><td>3</td></tr></table>

Bull spreads can also be created by buying a European put with a low strike price and selling a European put with a high strike price, as illustrated in Figure 12.3. Unlike bull spreads created from calls, those created from puts involve a positive up-front cash flow to the investor, but have margin requirements and a payoff that is either negative or zero.

# Bear Spreads

An investor who enters into a bull spread is hoping that the stock price will increase. By contrast, an investor who enters into a bear spread is hoping that the stock price will decline. Bear spreads can be created by buying a European put with one strike price and selling a European put with another strike price. The strike price of the option purchased is greater than the strike price of the option sold. (This is in contrast to a bull spread, where the strike price of the option purchased is always less than the strike price of the option sold.) In Figure 12.4, the profit from the spread is shown by the solid line. A bear spread created from puts involves an initial cash outflow because the price of the put sold is less than the price of the put purchased. In essence, the investor has bought a put with a certain strike price and chosen to give up some of the profit potential by selling a put with a lower strike price. In return for the profit given up, the investor gets the price of the option sold.

Assume that the strike prices are  $K_{1}$  and  $K_{2}$ , with  $K_{1} < K_{2}$ . Table 12.2 shows the payoff that will be realized from a bear spread in different circumstances. If the stock

If the stock price is less than  $K_{1}$ , the payoff is  $K_{2} - K_{1}$ . If the stock price is between  $K_{1}$  and  $K_{2}$ , the payoff is  $K_{2} - S_{T}$ . The profit is calculated by subtracting the initial cost from the payoff.


# Example 12.3

An investor buys for $3 a 3-month European put with a strike price of $35 and sells for $1 a 3-month European put with a strike price of $30. The payoff from this bear spread strategy is zero if the stock price is above $35, and $5 if it is below $30. If the stock price is between $30 and $35, the payoff is 35 - S_T. The options cost $3 - $1 = $2 up front. So the profit is:

<table><tr><td>Stock price range</td><td>Profit</td></tr><tr><td>ST≤30</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>30 &lt; ST &lt; 35</td><td>33 - ST</td></tr><tr><td>ST≥35</td><td>-2</td></tr></table>

Like bull spreads, bear spreads limit both the upside profit potential and the downside risk. Bear spreads can be created using calls instead of puts. The investor buys a call with a high strike price and sells a call with a low strike price, as illustrated in Figure 12.5. Bear spreads created with calls involve an initial cash inflow, but have margin requirements and a payoff that is either negative or zero.

# Box Spreads

A box spread is a combination of a bull call spread with strike prices  $K_{1}$  and  $K_{2}$  and a bear put spread with the same two strike prices. As shown in Table 12.3, the payoff from a box spread is always  $K_{2} - K_{1}$ . The value of a box spread is therefore always the present value of this payoff or  $(K_{2} - K_{1})e^{-rT}$ . If it has a different value there is an arbitrage opportunity. If the market price of the box spread is too low, it is profitable to buy the box. This involves buying a call with strike price  $K_{1}$ , buying a put with strike price  $K_{2}$ , selling a call with strike price  $K_{2}$ , and selling a put with strike price  $K_{1}$ . If the market price of the box spread is too high, it is profitable to sell the box. This involves buying a call with strike price  $K_{2}$ , buying a put with strike price  $K_{1}$ , selling a call with strike price  $K_{1}$ , and selling a put with strike price  $K_{2}$ .

It is important to realize that a box-spread arbitrage only works with European options. Many of the options that trade on exchanges are American. As shown in Business Snapshot 12.1, inexperienced traders who treat American options as European are liable to lose money.

# Butterfly Spreads

A butterfly spread involves positions in options with three different strike prices. It can be created by buying a European call option with a relatively low strike price  $K_{1}$ ,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/2adf159d7c3f4f2706c7a4dea1ba1eb2669d1ee5baaf5b16de6884300a1946f4.jpg)

# Business Snapshot 12.1 Losing Money with Box Spreads

Suppose that a stock has a price of $50 and a volatility of 30\%. No dividends are expected and the risk-free rate is 8\%. A trader offers you the chance to sell on the CBOE a 2-month box spread where the strike prices are $55 and $60 for $5.10. Should you do the trade?

The trade certainly sounds attractive. In this case  $K_{1} = 55$ ,  $K_{2} = 60$ , and the payoff is certain to be  $\5$  in 2 months. By selling the box spread for  $\$ 5.10  and investing the funds for 2 months you would have more than enough funds to meet the  $\5$  payoff in 2 months. The theoretical value of the box spread today is  $5 \times e^{-0.08 \times 2 / 12} = \$ 4.93 .

Unfortunately there is a snag. CBOE stock options are American and the $5 payoff from the box spread is calculated on the assumption that the options comprising the box are European. Option prices for this example (calculated using DerivaGem) are shown in the table below. A bull call spread where the strike prices are $55 and $60 costs 0.96 - 0.26 = $0.70. (This is the same for both European and American options because, as we saw in Chapter 11, the price of a European call is the same as the price of an American call when there are no dividends.) A bear put spread with the same strike prices costs 9.46 - 5.23 = $4.23 if the options are European and 10.00 - 5.44 = $4.56 if they are American. The combined value of both spreads if they are created with European options is 0.70 + 4.23 = $4.93. This is the theoretical box spread price calculated above. The combined value of buying both spreads if they are American is 0.70 + 4.56 = $5.26. Selling a box spread created with American options for $5.10 would not be a good trade. You would realize this almost immediately as the trade involves selling a $60 strike put and this would be exercised against you almost as soon as you sold it!

<table><tr><td>Option type</td><td>Strike price</td><td>European option price</td><td>American option price</td></tr><tr><td>Call</td><td>60</td><td>0.26</td><td>0.26</td></tr><tr><td>Call</td><td>55</td><td>0.96</td><td>0.96</td></tr><tr><td>Put</td><td>60</td><td>9.46</td><td>10.00</td></tr><tr><td>Put</td><td>55</td><td>5.23</td><td>5.44</td></tr></table>

*These payoffs are calculated using the relationship  $K_{2} = 0.5(K_{1} + K_{3})$ .

buying a European call option with a relatively high strike price  $K_{3}$ , and selling two European call options with a strike price  $K_{2}$  that is halfway between  $K_{1}$  and  $K_{3}$ . Generally,  $K_{2}$  is close to the current stock price. The pattern of profits from the strategy is shown in Figure 12.6. A butterfly spread leads to a profit if the stock price stays close to  $K_{2}$ , but gives rise to a small loss if there is a significant stock price move in either direction. It is therefore an appropriate strategy for an investor who feels that large stock price moves are unlikely. The strategy requires a small investment initially. The payoff from a butterfly spread is shown in Table 12.4.

Suppose that a certain stock is currently worth 61. Consider an investor who feels that a significant price move in the next 6 months is unlikely. Suppose that the market prices of 6-month European calls are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Strike price ($)</td><td>Call price ($)</td></tr><tr><td>55</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>60</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>65</td><td>5</td></tr></table>

The investor could create a butterfly spread by buying one call with a $55 strike price, buying one call with a $65 strike price, and selling two calls with a $60 strike price. It costs $10 + $5 - (2 × $7) = $1 to create the spread. If the stock price in 6 months is greater than $65 or less than $55, the total payoff is zero, and the investor incurs a net loss of $1. If the stock price is between $56 and $64, a profit is made. The maximum profit, $4, occurs when the stock price in 6 months is $60.

Butterfly spreads can be created using put options. The investor buys two European puts, one with a low strike price and one with a high strike price, and sells two European puts with an intermediate strike price, as illustrated in Figure 12.7. The butterfly spread in the example considered above would be created by buying one put with a strike price of  $55, another with a strike price of$ 65, and selling two puts with a strike price of 60. The use of put options results in exactly the same spread as the use of call options. Put-call parity can be used to show that the initial investment is the same in both cases.

Figure 12.7 Profit from butterfly spread using put options.

A butterfly spread can be sold or shorted by following the reverse strategy. Options are sold with strike prices of  $K_{1}$  and  $K_{3}$ , and two options with the middle strike price  $K_{2}$  are purchased. This strategy produces a modest profit if there is a significant movement in the stock price.

# Calendar Spreads

Up to now we have assumed that the options used to create a spread all expire at the same time. We now move on to consider calendar spreads in which the options have the same strike price and different expiration dates.

A calendar spread can be created by selling a European call option with a certain strike price and buying a longer-maturity European call option with the same strike price. The longer the maturity of an option, the more expensive it usually is. A calendar spread therefore usually requires an initial investment. Profit diagrams for calendar spreads are usually produced so that they show the profit when the short-maturity option expires on the assumption that the long-maturity option is closed out at that time. The profit pattern for a calendar spread produced from call options is shown in Figure 12.8. The pattern is similar to the profit from the butterfly spread in Figure 12.6. The investor makes a profit if the stock price at the expiration of the short-maturity option is close to the strike price of the short-maturity option. However, a loss is incurred when the stock price is significantly above or significantly below this strike price.

To understand the profit pattern from a calendar spread, first consider what happens if the stock price is very low when the short-maturity option expires. The short-maturity option is worthless and the value of the long-maturity option is close to zero. The investor therefore incurs a loss that is close to the cost of setting up the spread initially. Consider next what happens if the stock price,  $S_{T}$ , is very high when the short-maturity option expires. The short-maturity option costs the investor  $S_{T} - K$ , and the long-maturity option is worth close to  $S_{T} - K$ , where  $K$  is the strike price of the options. Again, the investor makes a net loss that is close to the cost of setting up the spread initially. If  $S_{T}$  is close to  $K$ , the short-maturity option costs the investor either a small amount or nothing at all. However, the long-maturity option is still quite valuable. In this case a net profit is made.

Figure 12.9 Profit from calendar spread created using two put options, calculated at the time when the short-maturity put option expires.


In a neutral calendar spread, a strike price close to the current stock price is chosen. A bullish calendar spread involves a higher strike price, whereas a bearish calendar spread involves a lower strike price.

Calendar spreads can be created with put options as well as call options. The investor buys a long-maturity put option and sells a short-maturity put option. As shown in Figure 12.9, the profit pattern is similar to that obtained from using calls.

A reverse calendar spread is the opposite to that in Figures 12.8 and 12.9. The investor buys a short-maturity option and sells a long-maturity option. A small profit arises if the stock price at the expiration of the short-maturity option is well above or well below the strike price of the short-maturity option. However, a loss results if it is close to the strike price.

# Diagonal Spreads

Bull, bear, and calendar spreads can all be created from a long position in one call and a short position in another call. In the case of bull and bear spreads, the calls have different strike prices and the same expiration date. In the case of calendar spreads, the calls have the same strike price and different expiration dates.

In a diagonal spread both the expiration date and the strike price of the calls are different. This increases the range of profit patterns that are possible.

# 12.4 COMBINATIONS

A combination is an option trading strategy that involves taking a position in both calls and puts on the same stock. We will consider straddles, strips, straps, and strangles.

# Straddle

One popular combination is a straddle, which involves buying a European call and put with the same strike price and expiration date. The profit pattern is shown in Figure 12.10. The strike price is denoted by  $K$ . If the stock price is close to this strike price at expiration of the options, the straddle leads to a loss. However, if there is a sufficiently large move in either direction, a significant profit will result. The payoff from a straddle is calculated in Table 12.5.

A straddle is appropriate when an investor is expecting a large move in a stock price but does not know in which direction the move will be. Consider an investor who feels that the price of a certain stock, currently valued at $69 by the market, will move significantly in the next 3 months. The investor could create a straddle by buying both a put and a call with a strike price of $70 and an expiration date in 3 months. Suppose that the call costs $4 and the put costs $3. If the stock price stays at $69, it is easy to see that the strategy costs the investor $6. (An up-front investment of $7 is required, the call expires worthless, and the put expires worth $1.) If the stock price moves to $70, a loss of $7 is experienced. (This is the worst that can happen.) However, if the stock price jumps up to $90, a profit of $13 is made; if the stock moves down to $55, a profit of $8 is made; and so on. As discussed in Business Snapshot 12.2 an investor should carefully consider whether the jump that he or she anticipates is already reflected in option prices before putting on a straddle trade.

The straddle in Figure 12.10 is sometimes referred to as a bottom straddle or straddle purchase. A top straddle or straddle write is the reverse position. It is created by selling a call and a put with the same exercise price and expiration date. It is a highly risky strategy.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/a3c594fba5cdf87ef3a7fb8cfa0abc221b9bb3bb6f53228909308b5e2d61512a.jpg)

# Business Snapshot 12.2 How to Make Money from Trading Straddles

Suppose that a big move is expected in a company's stock price because there is a takeover bid for the company or the outcome of a major lawsuit involving the company is about to be announced. Should you trade a straddle?

A straddle seems a natural trading strategy in this case. However, if your view of the company's situation is much the same as that of other market participants, this view will be reflected in the prices of options. Options on the stock will be significantly more expensive than options on a similar stock for which no jump is expected. The V-shaped profit pattern from the straddle in Figure 12.10 will have moved downward, so that a bigger move in the stock price is necessary for you to make a profit.

For a straddle to be an effective strategy, you must believe that there are likely to be big movements in the stock price and these beliefs must be different from those of most other investors. Market prices incorporate the beliefs of market participants. To make money from any investment strategy, you must take a view that is different from most of the rest of the market—and you must be right!

If the stock price on the expiration date is close to the strike price, a profit results. However, the loss arising from a large move is unlimited.

# Strips and Straps

A strip consists of a long position in one European call and two European puts with the same strike price and expiration date. A strap consists of a long position in two European calls and one European put with the same strike price and expiration date. The profit patterns from strips and straps are shown in Figure 12.11. In a strip the investor is betting that there will be a big stock price move and considers a decrease in the stock price to be more likely than an increase. In a strap the investor is also betting that there will be a big stock price move. However, in this case, an increase in the stock price is considered to be more likely than a decrease.

# Strangles

In a strangle, sometimes called a bottom vertical combination, an investor buys a European put and a European call with the same expiration date and different strike prices. The profit pattern is shown in Figure 12.12. The call strike price,  $K_{2}$ , is higher than the put strike price,  $K_{1}$ . The payoff function for a strangle is calculated in Table 12.6.

A strangle is a similar strategy to a straddle. The investor is betting that there will be a large price move, but is uncertain whether it will be an increase or a decrease. Comparing Figures 12.12 and 12.10, we see that the stock price has to move farther in a strangle than in a straddle for the investor to make a profit. However, the downside risk if the stock price ends up at a central value is less with a strangle.

The profit pattern obtained with a strangle depends on how close together the strike prices are. The farther they are apart, the less the downside risk and the farther the stock price has to move for a profit to be realized.

The sale of a strangle is sometimes referred to as a top vertical combination. It can be appropriate for an investor who feels that large stock price moves are unlikely. However, as with sale of a straddle, it is a risky strategy involving unlimited potential loss to the investor.

# 12.5 OTHER PAYOFFS

This chapter has demonstrated just a few of the ways in which options can be used to produce an interesting relationship between profit and stock price. If European options

The easiest illustration of this involves butterfly spreads. Recall that a butterfly spread is created by buying options with strike prices  $K_{1}$  and  $K_{3}$  and selling two options with strike price  $K_{2}$ , where  $K_{1} < K_{2} < K_{3}$  and  $K_{3} - K_{2} = K_{2} - K_{1}$ . Figure 12.13 shows the payoff from a butterfly spread. The pattern could be described as a spike. As  $K_{1}$  and  $K_{3}$  move closer together, the spike becomes smaller. Through the judicious combination of a large number of very small spikes, any payoff function can in theory be approximated as accurately as desired.

# SUMMARY

Principal-protected notes can be created from a zero-coupon bond and a European call option. They are attractive to some investors because the issuer of the product guarantees that the purchaser will receive his or her principal back regardless of the performance of the asset underlying the option.

A number of common trading strategies involve a single option and the underlying stock. For example, writing a covered call involves buying the stock and selling a call option on the stock; a protective put involves buying a put option and buying the stock. The former is similar to selling a put option; the latter is similar to buying a call option.

Spreads involve either taking a position in two or more calls or taking a position in two or more puts. A bull spread can be created by buying a call (put) with a low strike price and selling a call (put) with a high strike price. A bear spread can be created by buying a put (call) with a high strike price and selling a put (call) with a low strike price. A butterfly spread involves buying calls (puts) with a low and high strike price and selling two calls (puts) with some intermediate strike price. A calendar spread involves selling a call (put) with a short time to expiration and buying a call (put) with a longer time to expiration. A diagonal spread involves a long position in one option and a short position in another option such that both the strike price and the expiration date are different.

Combinations involve taking a position in both calls and puts on the same stock. A straddle combination involves taking a long position in a call and a long position in a put with the same strike price and expiration date. A strip consists of a long position in one call and two puts with the same strike price and expiration date. A strap consists of a long position in two calls and one put with the same strike price and expiration date. A strangle consists of a long position in a call and a put with different strike prices and the same expiration date. There are many other ways in which options can be used to produce interesting payoffs. It is not surprising that option trading has steadily increased in popularity and continues to fascinate investors.

A useful and very popular technique for pricing an option involves constructing a binomial tree. This is a diagram representing different possible paths that might be followed by the stock price over the life of an option. The underlying assumption is that the stock price follows a random walk. In each time step, it has a certain probability of moving up by a certain percentage amount and a certain probability of moving down by a certain percentage amount. In the limit, as the time step becomes smaller, this model is the same as the Black-Scholes-Merton model we will be discussing in Chapter 15. Indeed, in the appendix to this chapter, we show that the European option price given by the binomial tree converges to the Black-Scholes-Merton price as the time step becomes smaller.

The material in this chapter is important for a number of reasons. First, it explains the nature of the no-arbitrage arguments that are used for valuing options. Second, it explains the binomial tree numerical procedure that is widely used for valuing American options and other derivatives. Third, it introduces a very important principle known as risk-neutral valuation.

The general approach to constructing trees in this chapter is the one used in an important paper published by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein in 1979. More details on numerical procedures using binomial trees are given in Chapter 21.

# 13.1 A ONE-STEP BINOMIAL MODEL AND A NO-ARBITRAGE ARGUMENT

We start by considering a very simple situation. A stock price is currently $20, and it is known that at the end of 3 months it will be either $22 or $18. We are interested in valuing a European call option to buy the stock for $21 in 3 months. This option will have one of two values at the end of the 3 months. If the stock price turns out to be $22, the value of the option will be $1; if the stock price turns out to be 18, the value of the option will be zero. The situation is illustrated in Figure 13.1.

It turns out that a relatively simple argument can be used to price the option in this example. The only assumption needed is that arbitrage opportunities do not exist. We set up a portfolio of the stock and the option in such a way that there is no uncertainty about the value of the portfolio at the end of the 3 months. We then argue that, because the portfolio has no risk, the return it earns must equal the risk-free interest rate. This enables us to work out the cost of setting up the portfolio and therefore the option's price. Because there are two securities (the stock and the stock option) and only two possible outcomes, it is always possible to set up the riskless portfolio.

Figure 13.1 Stock price movements for numerical example in Section 13.1.


Consider a portfolio consisting of a long position in  $\Delta$  shares of the stock and a short position in one call option (  $\Delta$  is the Greek capital letter "delta"). We calculate the value of  $\Delta$  that makes the portfolio riskless. If the stock price moves up from  $20 to$ 22, the value of the shares is  $22\Delta$  and the value of the option is 1, so that the total value of the portfolio is  $22\Delta - 1$ . If the stock price moves down from  $20 to$ 18, the value of the shares is  $18\Delta$  and the value of the option is zero, so that the total value of the portfolio is  $18\Delta$ . The portfolio is riskless if the value of  $\Delta$  is chosen so that the final value of the portfolio is the same for both alternatives. This means that

$$

2 2 \Delta - 1 = 1 8 \Delta

$$ or


$$

\Delta = 0. 2 5

$$

A riskless portfolio is therefore

Long: 0.25 shares

Short: 1 option.

If the stock price moves up to 22, the value of the portfolio is

$$

2 2 \times 0. 2 5 - 1 = 4. 5

$$

If the stock price moves down to 18, the value of the portfolio is

$$

1 8 \times 0. 2 5 = 4. 5

$$

Regardless of whether the stock price moves up or down, the value of the portfolio is always 4.5 at the end of the life of the option.

Riskless portfolios must, in the absence of arbitrage opportunities, earn the risk-free rate of interest. Suppose that, in this case, the risk-free rate is  $4\%$  per annum (continuously compounded). It follows that the value of the portfolio today must be the present value of 4.5, or

$$
4. 5 e ^ {- 0. 0 4 \times 3 / 1 2} = 4. 4 5 5
$$

The value of the stock price today is known to be 20. Suppose the option price is denoted by f. The value of the portfolio today is

$$

2 0 \times 0. 2 5 - f = 5 - f

$$

It follows that

$$

5 - f = 4. 4 5 5

$$ or


$$ f = 0. 5 4 5
$$

This shows that, in the absence of arbitrage opportunities, the current value of the option must be 0.545. If the value of the option were more than 0.545, the portfolio would cost less than 4.455 to set up and would earn more than the risk-free rate. If the value of the option were less than 0.545, shorting the portfolio would provide a way of borrowing money at less than the risk-free rate.

Trading 0.25 shares is, of course, not possible. However, the argument is the same if we imagine selling 400 options and buying 100 shares. In general, it is necessary to buy  $\Delta$  shares for each option sold to form a riskless portfolio. The parameter  $\Delta$  (delta) is important in the hedging of options. It is discussed further later in this chapter and in Chapter 19.

# A Generalization

We can generalize the no-arbitrage argument just presented by considering a stock whose price is  $S_0$  and an option on the stock (or any derivative dependent on the stock) whose current price is  $f$ . We suppose that the option lasts for time  $T$  and that during the life of the option the stock price can either move up from  $S_0$  to a new level,  $S_0u$ , where  $u > 1$ , or down from  $S_0$  to a new level,  $S_0d$ , where  $d < 1$ . The percentage increase in the stock price when there is an up movement is  $u - 1$ ; the percentage decrease when there is a down movement is  $1 - d$ . If the stock price moves up to  $S_0u$ , we suppose that the payoff from the option is  $f_u$ ; if the stock price moves down to  $S_0d$ , we suppose the payoff from the option is  $f_d$ . The situation is illustrated in Figure 13.2.

As before, we imagine a portfolio consisting of a long position in  $\Delta$  shares and a short position in one option. We calculate the value of  $\Delta$  that makes the portfolio riskless. If there is an up movement in the stock price, the value of the portfolio at the end of the life of the option is

$$
S _ {0} u \Delta - f _ {u}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/7bcecaa113cac36b513743511ba9196d16e9a95a7dba6bc4965f695b920d8980.jpg)

Figure 13.2 Stock and option prices in a general one-step tree.

If there is a down movement in the stock price, the value becomes

$$
S _ {0} d \Delta - f _ {d}
$$

The two are equal when

$$
S _ {0} u \Delta - f _ {u} = S _ {0} d \Delta - f _ {d}
$$ or


$$

\Delta = \frac {f _ {u} - f _ {d}}{S _ {0} u - S _ {0} d} \tag {13.1}

$$

In this case, the portfolio is riskless and, for there to be no arbitrage opportunities, it must earn the risk-free interest rate. Equation (13.1) shows that  $\Delta$  is the ratio of the change in the option price to the change in the stock price as we move between the nodes at time  $T$ .

If we denote the risk-free interest rate by  $r$ , the present value of the portfolio is

$$

(S _ {0} u \Delta - f _ {u}) e ^ {- r T}

$$

The cost of setting up the portfolio is

$$

S _ {0} \Delta - f

$$

It follows that

$$

S _ {0} \Delta - f = \left(S _ {0} u \Delta - f _ {u}\right) e ^ {- r T}

$$ or


$$ f = S _ {0} \Delta (1 - u e ^ {- r T}) + f _ {u} e ^ {- r T}
$$

Substituting from equation (13.1) for  $\Delta$ , we obtain

$$ f = S _ {0} \left(\frac {f _ {u} - f _ {d}}{S _ {0} u - S _ {0} d}\right) \left(1 - u e ^ {- r T}\right) + f _ {u} e ^ {- r T}
$$ or


$$ f = \frac {f _ {u} (1 - d e ^ {- r T}) + f _ {d} (u e ^ {- r T} - 1)}{u - d}
$$ or


$$ f = e ^ {- r T} \left[ p f _ {u} + (1 - p) f _ {d} \right] \tag {13.2}
$$ where


$$ p = \frac {e ^ {r T} - d}{u - d} \tag {13.3}
$$

Equations (13.2) and (13.3) enable an option to be priced when stock price movements are given by a one-step binomial tree. The only assumption needed for the equation is that there are no arbitrage opportunities in the market.

In the numerical example considered previously (see Figure 13.1),  $u = 1.1$ ,  $d = 0.9$ ,  $r = 0.04$ ,  $T = 0.25$ ,  $f_{u} = 1$ , and  $f_{d} = 0$ . From equation (13.3), we have

$$ p = \frac {e ^ {0 . 0 4 \times 3 / 1 2} - 0 . 9}{1 . 1 - 0 . 9} = 0. 5 5 0 3
$$ and, from equation (13.2), we have


$$ f = e ^ {- 0. 0 4 \times 0. 2 5} (0. 5 5 0 3 \times 1 + 0. 4 4 9 7 \times 0) = 0. 5 4 5
$$

The result agrees with the answer obtained earlier in this section.

# Irrelevance of the Stock's Expected Return

The option pricing formula in equation (13.2) does not involve the probabilities of the stock price moving up or down. For example, we get the same option price when the probability of an upward movement is 0.5 as we do when it is 0.9. This is surprising and seems counterintuitive. It is natural to assume that, as the probability of an upward movement in the stock price increases, the value of a call option on the stock increases and the value of a put option on the stock decreases. This is not the case.

The key reason is that we are not valuing the option in absolute terms. We are calculating its value in terms of the price of the underlying stock. The probabilities of future up or down movements are already incorporated into the stock price: we do not need to take them into account again when valuing the option in terms of the stock price.

# 13.2 RISK-NEUTRAL VALUATION

We are now in a position to introduce a very important principle in the pricing of derivatives known as risk-neutral valuation. This states that, when valuing a derivative, we can make the assumption that investors are risk-neutral. This assumption means investors do not increase the expected return they require from an investment to compensate for increased risk. A world where investors are risk-neutral is referred to as a risk-neutral world. The world we live in is, of course, not a risk-neutral world. The higher the risks investors take, the higher the expected returns they require. However, it turns out that assuming a risk-neutral world gives us the right option price for the world we live in, as well as for a risk-neutral world. Almost miraculously, it finesse the problem that we know hardly anything about the risk aversion of the buyers and sellers of options.

Risk-neutral valuation seems a surprising result when it is first encountered. Options are risky investments. Should not a person's risk preferences affect how they are priced? The answer is that, when we are pricing an option in terms of the price of the underlying stock, risk preferences are unimportant. As investors become more risk-averse, stock prices decline, but the formulas relating option prices to stock prices remain the same.

A risk-neutral world has two features that simplify the pricing of derivatives:

1. The expected return on a stock (or any other investment) is the risk-free rate.
2. The discount rate used for the expected payoff on an option (or any other instrument) is the risk-free rate.

Returning to equation (13.2), the parameter  $p$  should be interpreted as the probability of an up movement in a risk-neutral world, so that  $1 - p$  is the probability of a down movement in this world. (We assume  $u > e^{rT}$ , so that  $0 < p < 1$ .) The expression

$$ p f _ {u} + (1 - p) f _ {d}
$$ is the expected future payoff from the option in a risk-neutral world and equation (13.2) states that the value of the option today is its expected future payoff in a risk-neutral world discounted at the risk-free rate. This is an application of risk-neutral valuation.


To prove the validity of our interpretation of  $p$ , we note that, when  $p$  is the probability of an up movement, the expected stock price  $E(S_{T})$  at time  $T$  is given by

$$

E (S _ {T}) = p S _ {0} u + (1 - p) S _ {0} d

$$ or


$$

E (S _ {T}) = p S _ {0} (u - d) + S _ {0} d

$$

Substituting from equation (13.3) for  $p$  gives

$$

E \left(S _ {T}\right) = S _ {0} e ^ {r T} \tag {13.4}

$$

This shows that the stock price grows, on average, at the risk-free rate when  $p$  is the probability of an up movement. In other words, the stock price behaves exactly as we would expect it to behave in a risk-neutral world when  $p$  is the probability of an up movement.

Risk-neutral valuation is a very important general result in the pricing of derivatives. It states that, when we assume the world is risk-neutral, we get the right price for a derivative in all worlds, not just in a risk-neutral one. We have shown that risk-neutral valuation is correct when a simple binomial model is assumed for how the price of the stock evolves. We will prove it when the stock price follows a continuous-time stochastic process in Chapter 15. It is a result that is true regardless of the assumptions made about the evolution of the stock price.

To apply risk-neutral valuation to the pricing of a derivative, we first calculate what the probabilities of different outcomes would be if the world were risk-neutral. We then calculate the expected payoff from the derivative and discount that expected payoff at the risk-free rate of interest.

# The One-Step Binomial Example Revisited

We now return to the example in Figure 13.1 and illustrate that risk-neutral valuation gives the same answer as no-arbitrage arguments. In Figure 13.1, the stock price is currently  $20 and will move either up to$ 22 or down to $18 at the end of 3 months. The option considered is a European call option with a strike price of $21 and an expiration date in 3 months. The risk-free interest rate is 4\% per annum.

We define  $p$  as the probability of an upward movement in the stock price in a risk-neutral world. We can calculate  $p$  from equation (13.3). Alternatively, we can argue that the expected return on the stock in a risk-neutral world must be the risk-free rate of  $4\%$ . This means that  $p$  must satisfy

$$

2 2 p + 1 8 (1 - p) = 2 0 e ^ {0. 0 4 \times 3 / 1 2}

$$ or


$$

4 p = 2 0 e ^ {0. 0 4 \times 3 / 1 2} - 1 8

$$

That is,  $p$  must be 0.5503.

At the end of the 3 months, the call option has a 0.5503 probability of being worth 1 and a 0.4497 probability of being worth zero. Its expected value is therefore

$$
0. 5 5 0 3 \times 1 + 0. 4 4 9 7 \times 0 = 0. 5 5 0 3
$$

In a risk-neutral world this should be discounted at the risk-free rate. The value of the option today is therefore

$$
0. 5 5 0 3 e ^ {- 0. 0 4 \times 3 / 1 2}
$$ or 0.545. This is the same as the value obtained earlier, demonstrating that no-arbitrage arguments and risk-neutral valuation give the same answer.


# Real World vs. Risk-Neutral World

It should be emphasized that  $p$  is the probability of an up movement in a risk-neutral world. In general, this is not the same as the probability of an up movement in the real world. In our example  $p = 0.5503$ . When the probability of an up movement is 0.5503, the expected return on both the stock and the option is the risk-free rate of  $4\%$ . Suppose that, in the real world, the expected return on the stock is  $10\%$  and  $p^*$  is the probability of an up movement in this world. It follows that

$$

2 2 p ^ {*} + 1 8 \left(1 - p ^ {*}\right) = 2 0 e ^ {0. 1 0 \times 3 / 1 2}

$$ so that  $p^* = 0.6266$ .

The expected payoff from the option in the real world is then given by

$$ p ^ {*} \times 1 + (1 - p ^ {*}) \times 0
$$ or 0.6266. Unfortunately, it is not easy to know the correct discount rate to apply to the expected payoff in the real world. The return the market requires on the stock is  $10\%$  and this is the discount rate that would be used for the expected cash flows from an investment in the stock. A position in a call option is riskier than a position in the stock. As a result the discount rate to be applied to the payoff from a call option is greater than  $10\%$ , but we do not have a direct measure of how much greater than  $10\%$  it should be. Using risk-neutral valuation solves this problem because we know that in a risk-neutral world the expected return on all assets (and therefore the discount rate to use for all expected payoffs) is the risk-free rate.


# 13.3 TWO-STEP BINOMIAL TREES

We can extend the analysis to a two-step binomial tree such as that shown in Figure 13.3. Here the stock price starts at  $20 and in each of two time steps may go up by 10\%$  or down by  $10\%$ . Each time step is 3 months long and the risk-free interest rate is  $4\%$  per annum. We consider a 6-month option with a strike price of 21.

The objective of the analysis is to calculate the option price at the initial node of the tree. This can be done by repeatedly applying the principles established earlier in the chapter. Figure 13.4 shows the same tree as Figure 13.3, but with both the stock price and the option price at each node. (The stock price is the upper number and the option price is the lower number.) The option prices at the final nodes of the tree are easily calculated. They are the payoffs from the option. At node D the stock price is 24.2 and the option price is  $24.2 - 21 = 3.2$ ; at nodes E and F the option is out of the money and its value is zero.

At node C the option price is zero, because node C leads to either node E or node F and at both of those nodes the option price is zero. We calculate the option price at node B by focusing our attention on the part of the tree shown in Figure 13.5. Using the notation introduced earlier in the chapter,  $u = 1.1$ ,  $d = 0.9$ ,  $r = 0.04$ , and  $T = 0.25$ , so that  $p = 0.5503$ , and equation (13.2) gives the value of the option at node B as

It remains for us to calculate the option price at the initial node A. We do so by focusing on the first step of the tree. We know that the value of the option at node B is 1.7433 and that at node C it is zero. Equation (13.2) therefore gives the value at node A as

Figure 13.5 Evaluation of option price at node B of Figure 13.4.

$$ e ^ {- 0. 0 4 \times 3 / 1 2} (0. 5 5 0 3 \times 1. 7 4 3 3 + 0. 4 4 9 7 \times 0) = 0. 9 4 9 7
$$

The value of the option is 0.9497.

Note that this example was constructed so that  $u$  and  $d$  (the proportional up and down movements) were the same at each node of the tree and so that the time steps were of the same length. As a result, the risk-neutral probability,  $p$ , as calculated by equation (13.3) is the same at each node.

# A Generalization

We can generalize the case of two time steps by considering the situation in Figure 13.6. The stock price is initially  $S_0$ . During each time step, it either moves up to  $u$  times its value at the beginning of the time step or moves down to  $d$  times this value. The notation for the value of the option is shown on the tree. (For example, after two up movements the value of the option is  $f_{uu}$ .) We suppose that the risk-free interest rate is  $r$  and the length of the time step is  $\Delta t$  years.

Because the length of a time step is now  $\Delta t$  rather than  $T$ , equations (13.2) and (13.3) become

$$ f = e ^ {- r \Delta t} [ p f _ {u} + (1 - p) f _ {d} ] \tag {13.5}
$$

$$ p = \frac {e ^ {r \Delta t} - d}{u - d} \tag {13.6}
$$

Repeated application of equation (13.5) gives

$$ f _ {u} = e ^ {- r \Delta t} \left[ p f _ {u u} + (1 - p) f _ {u d} \right] \tag {13.7}
$$

$$ f _ {d} = e ^ {- r \Delta t} [ p f _ {u d} + (1 - p) f _ {d d} ] \tag {13.8}
$$

$$ f = e ^ {- r \Delta t} [ p f _ {u} + (1 - p) f _ {d} ] \tag {13.9}
$$

Substituting from equations (13.7) and (13.8) into (13.9), we get

$$ f = e ^ {- 2 r \Delta t} \left[ p ^ {2} f _ {u u} + 2 p (1 - p) f _ {u d} + (1 - p) ^ {2} f _ {d d} \right] \tag {13.10}
$$

This is consistent with the principle of risk-neutral valuation mentioned earlier. The variables  $p^2, 2p(1 - p)$ , and  $(1 - p)^2$  are the probabilities that the upper, middle, and lower final nodes will be reached. The option price is equal to its expected payoff in a risk-neutral world discounted at the risk-free interest rate.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/e74caa267ec4df8da57bfa82e85f107b9dfae1c0cb72632ee4a3b8bbeda5630c.jpg)

Figure 13.6 Stock and option prices in general two-step tree.

As we add more steps to the binomial tree, the risk-neutral valuation principle continues to hold. The option price is always equal to its expected payoff in a risk-neutral world discounted at the risk-free interest rate.

# 13.4 A PUT EXAMPLE

The procedures described in this chapter can be used to price puts as well as calls. Consider a 2-year European put with a strike price of  $52 on a stock whose current price is$ 50. We suppose that there are two time steps of 1 year, and in each time step the stock price either moves up by 20\% or moves down by 20\%. We also suppose that the risk-free interest rate is 5\%.

The tree is shown in Figure 13.7. In this case  $u = 1.2$ ,  $d = 0.8$ ,  $\Delta t = 1$ , and  $r = 0.05$ . From equation (13.6) the value of the risk-neutral probability,  $p$ , is given by

$$ p = \frac {e ^ {0 . 0 5 \times 1} - 0 . 8}{1 . 2 - 0 . 8} = 0. 6 2 8 2
$$

The possible final stock prices are:  $72,$ 48, and $32. In this case,  $f_{uu} = 0, f_{ud} = 4,$  and  $f_{dd} = 20$ . From equation (13.10),

$$ f = e ^ {- 2 \times 0. 0 5 \times 1} \left(0. 6 2 8 2 ^ {2} \times 0 + 2 \times 0. 6 2 8 2 \times 0. 3 7 1 8 \times 4 + 0. 3 7 1 8 ^ {2} \times 2 0\right) = 4. 1 9 2 3
$$

The value of the put is 4.1923. This result can also be obtained using equation (13.5) and working back through the tree one step at a time. Figure 13.7 shows the intermediate option prices that are calculated.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/89513597078a79945eb1293146a74989469011738726b95fb0190b7721d4af02.jpg)

# 13.5 AMERICAN OPTIONS

Up to now all the options we have considered have been European. We now move on to consider how American options can be valued using a binomial tree such as that in Figure 13.4 or 13.7. The procedure is to work back through the tree from the end to the beginning, testing at each node to see whether early exercise is optimal. The value of the option at the final nodes is the same as for the European option. At earlier nodes the value of the option is the greater of

1. The value given by equation (13.5)
2. The payoff from early exercise.

Figure 13.8 shows how Figure 13.7 is affected if the option under consideration is American rather than European. The stock prices and their probabilities are unchanged. The values for the option at the final nodes are also unchanged. At node B, equation (13.5) gives the value of the option as 1.4147, whereas the payoff from early exercise is negative  $(= -8)$ . Clearly early exercise is not optimal at node B, and the value of the option at this node is 1.4147. At node C, equation (13.5) gives the value of the option as 9.4636, whereas the payoff from early exercise is 12. In this case, early exercise is optimal and the value of the option at the node is 12. At the initial node A, the value given by equation (13.5) is

$$ e ^ {- 0. 0 5 \times 1} (0. 6 2 8 2 \times 1. 4 1 4 7 + 0. 3 7 1 8 \times 1 2. 0) = 5. 0 8 9 4
$$ and the payoff from early exercise is 2. In this case early exercise is not optimal. The value of the option is therefore  $5.0894$ .

# 13.6 DELTA

At this stage, it is appropriate to introduce delta, an important parameter (sometimes referred to as a "Greek letter" or simply a "Greek") in the pricing and hedging of options.

The delta  $(\Delta)$  of a stock option is the ratio of the change in the price of the stock option to the change in the price of the underlying stock. It is the number of units of the stock we should hold for each option shorted in order to create a riskless portfolio. It is the same as the  $\Delta$  introduced earlier in this chapter. The construction of a riskless portfolio is sometimes referred to as delta hedging. The delta of a call option is positive, whereas the delta of a put option is negative.

From Figure 13.1, we can calculate the value of the delta of the call option being considered as

$$

\frac {1 - 0}{2 2 - 1 8} = 0. 2 5

$$

This is because when the stock price changes from $18 to $22, the option price changes from $0 to $1. (This is also the value of Δ calculated in Section 13.1.)

In Figure 13.4 the delta corresponding to stock price movements over the first time step is

$$

\frac {1 . 7 4 3 3 - 0}{2 2 - 1 8} = 0. 4 3 5 8

$$

The delta for stock price movements over the second time step is

$$

\frac {3 . 2 - 0}{2 4 . 2 - 1 9 . 8} = 0. 7 2 7 3

$$ if there is an upward movement over the first time step, and


$$

\frac {0 - 0}{1 9 . 8 - 1 6 . 2} = 0

$$ if there is a downward movement over the first time step.


From Figure 13.7, delta is

$$

\frac {1 . 4 1 4 7 - 9 . 4 6 3 6}{6 0 - 4 0} = - 0. 4 0 2 4

$$ at the end of the first time step, and either


$$

\frac {0 - 4}{7 2 - 4 8} = - 0. 1 6 6 7 \quad \text {o r} \quad \frac {4 - 2 0}{4 8 - 3 2} = - 1. 0 0 0 0

$$ at the end of the second time step.


The two-step examples show that delta changes over time. (In Figure 13.4, delta changes from 0.4358 to either 0.7273 or 0; and, in Figure 13.7, it changes from  $-0.4024$  to either  $-0.1667$  or  $-1.0000$ .) Thus, in order to maintain a riskless hedge using an option and the underlying stock, we need to adjust our holdings in the stock periodically. We will return to this feature of options in Chapter 19.

# 13.7 MATCHING VOLATILITY WITH  $u$  AND  $d$

The three parameters necessary to construct a binomial tree with time step  $\Delta t$  are  $u$ ,  $d$ , and  $p$ . Once  $u$  and  $d$  have been specified,  $p$  must be chosen so that the expected return is the risk-free rate  $r$ . We have already shown that

$$ p = \frac {e ^ {r \Delta t} - d}{u - d} \tag {13.11}
$$

The parameters  $u$  and  $d$  should be chosen to match volatility. The volatility of a stock (or any other asset),  $\sigma$ , is defined so that the standard deviation of its return in a short period of time  $\Delta t$  is  $\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}$  (see Chapter 15 for a further discussion of this). Equivalently the variance of the return in time  $\Delta t$  is  $\sigma^2 \Delta t$ . The variance of a variable  $X$  is defined as  $E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2$ , where  $E$  denotes expected value. During a time step of length  $\Delta t$ , there is a probability  $p$  that the stock will provide a return of  $u - 1$  and a probability  $1 - p$  that it will provide a return of  $d - 1$ . It follows that volatility is matched if

$$ p (u - 1) ^ {2} + (1 - p) (d - 1) ^ {2} - [ p (u - 1) + (1 - p) (d - 1) ] ^ {2} = \sigma^ {2} \Delta t \tag {13.12}
$$

Substituting for  $p$  from equation (13.11), this simplifies to

$$ e ^ {r \Delta t} (u + d) - u d - e ^ {2 r \Delta t} = \sigma^ {2} \Delta t \tag {13.13}
$$

Figure 13.9 Change in stock price in time  $\Delta t$  in (a) the real world and (b) the risk-neutral world.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/137152d1650d8b83e699156e07ac55f801fd92b29c523e89a18d465d013b53ef.jpg)

When terms in  $\Delta t^2$  and higher powers of  $\Delta t$  are ignored, a solution to equation (13.13) is

$$ u = e ^ {\sigma \sqrt {\Delta t}} \quad \text {a n d} \quad d = e ^ {- \sigma \sqrt {\Delta t}}
$$

These are the values of  $u$  and  $d$  used by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979).

In the analysis just given we chose  $u$  and  $d$  to match volatility in the risk-neutral world. What happens if instead we match volatility in the real world? As we will now show, the formulas for  $u$  and  $d$  are the same.

Suppose that  $p^*$  is the probability of an up-movement in the real world while  $p$  is as before the probability of an up-movement in a risk-neutral world. This is illustrated in Figure 13.9. Define  $\mu$  as the expected return in the real world. We must have

$$ p ^ {*} u + (1 - p ^ {*}) d = e ^ {\mu \Delta t}
$$ or


$$ p ^ {*} = \frac {e ^ {\mu \Delta t} - d}{u - d} \tag {13.14}
$$

Suppose that  $\sigma$  is the volatility in the real world. The equation matching the variance is the same as equation (13.12) except that  $p$  is replaced by  $p^*$ . When this equation is combined with equation (13.14), we obtain

$$ e ^ {\mu \Delta t} (u + d) - u d - e ^ {2 \mu \Delta t} = \sigma^ {2} \Delta t
$$

This is the same as equation (13.13) except the  $r$  is replaced by  $\mu$ . When terms in  $\Delta t^2$  and higher powers of  $\Delta t$  are ignored, it has the same solution as equation (13.13):

$$ u = e ^ {\sigma \sqrt {\Delta t}} \quad \text {a n d} \quad d = e ^ {- \sigma \sqrt {\Delta t}}
$$

# Girsanov's Theorem

The results we have just produced are closely related to an important result known as Girsanov's theorem. When we move from the risk-neutral world to the real world, the expected return from the stock price changes, but its volatility remains the same. More

$$ e ^ {x} = 1 + x + \frac {x ^ {2}}{2 !} + \frac {x ^ {3}}{3 !} + \dots
$$ generally, when we move from a world with one set of risk preferences to a world with another set of risk preferences, the expected growth rates in variables change, but their volatilities remain the same. We will examine the impact of risk preferences on the behavior of market variables in more detail in Chapter 28. Moving from one set of risk preferences to another is sometimes referred to as changing the measure. The real-world measure is sometimes referred to as the  $P$ -measure, while the risk-neutral world measure is referred to as the  $Q$ -measure.


# 13.8 THE BINOMIAL TREE FORMULAS

The analysis in the previous section shows that, when the length of the time step on a binomial tree is  $\Delta t$ , we should match volatility by setting

$$ u = e ^ {\sigma \sqrt {\Delta t}} \tag {13.15}
$$ and


$$ d = e ^ {- \sigma \sqrt {\Delta t}} \tag {13.16}
$$

Also, from equation (13.6),

$$ p = \frac {a - d}{u - d} \tag {13.17}
$$ where


$$ a = e ^ {r \Delta t} \tag {13.18}
$$

Equations (13.15) to (13.18) define the tree.

Consider again the American put option in Figure 13.8, where the stock price is  $50, the strike price is$ 52, the risk-free rate is 5\%, the life of the option is 2 years, and there are two time steps. In this case,  $\Delta t = 1$ . Suppose that the volatility  $\sigma$  is 30\%. Then, from equations (13.15) to (13.18), we have

$$ u = e ^ {0. 3 \times 1} = 1. 3 4 9 9, \quad d = \frac {1}{1 . 3 4 9 9} = 0. 7 4 0 8, \quad a = e ^ {0. 0 5 \times 1} = 1. 0 5 1 3
$$ and


$$ p = \frac {1 . 0 5 1 3 - 0 . 7 4 0 8}{1 . 3 4 9 9 - 0 . 7 4 0 8} = 0. 5 0 9 7
$$

The tree is shown in Figure 13.10. The value of the put option is 7.43. (This is different from the value obtained in Figure 13.8 by assuming  $u = 1.2$  and  $d = 0.8$ .) Note that the option is exercised at the end of the first time step if the lower node is reached.

# 13.9 INCREASING THE NUMBER OF STEPS

The binomial model presented above is unrealistically simple. Clearly, an analyst can expect to obtain only a very rough approximation to an option price by assuming that stock price movements during the life of the option consist of one or two binomial steps.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/a211ddc03548f8fc834a9eaac6cb931a3fb4a5896ec8b690b0195156fa55d9ec.jpg)

Figure 13.10 Two-step tree to value a 2-year American put option when the stock price is 50, strike price is 52, risk-free rate is  $5\%$ , and volatility is  $30\%$ .

When binomial trees are used in practice, the life of the option is typically divided into 30 or more time steps. In each time step there is a binomial stock price movement. With 30 time steps there are 31 terminal stock prices and  $2^{30}$ , or about 1 billion, possible stock price paths are implicitly considered.

The equations defining the tree are equations (13.15) to (13.18), regardless of the number of time steps. Suppose, for example, that there are five steps instead of two in the example we considered in Figure 13.10. The parameters would be  $\Delta t = 2 / 5 = 0.4$ ,  $r = 0.05$ , and  $\sigma = 0.3$ . These values give  $u = e^{0.3 \times \sqrt{0.4}} = 1.2089$ ,  $d = 1 / 1.2089 = 0.8272$ ,  $a = e^{0.05 \times 0.4} = 1.0202$ , and  $p = (1.0202 - 0.8272) / (1.2089 - 0.8272) = 0.5056$ .

As the number of time steps is increased (so that  $\Delta t$  becomes smaller), the binomial tree model makes the same assumptions about stock price behavior as the Black-Scholes-Merton model, which will be presented in Chapter 15. When the binomial tree is used to price a European option, the price converges to the Black-Scholes-Merton price, as expected, as the number of time steps is increased. This is proved in the appendix to this chapter.

# 13.10 USING DerivaGem

The software accompanying this book, DerivaGem, is a useful tool for becoming comfortable with binomial trees. After loading the software in the way described at the end of this book, go to the Equity_FX_Indx_Fut_Opts_Calc worksheet. Choose Equity as the Underlying Type and select Binomial American as the Option Type.

Enter the stock price, volatility, risk-free rate, time to expiration, exercise price, and tree steps, as 50,  $30\%$ ,  $5\%$ , 2, 52, and 2, respectively. Click on the Put button and then on Calculate. The price of the option is shown as 7.428 in the box labeled Price. Now click on Display Tree and you will see the equivalent of Figure 13.10. (The red numbers in the software indicate the nodes where the option is exercised.)

Return to the Equity_FX_Indx_Fut_Opts_Calc worksheet and change the number of time steps to 5. Hit Enter and click on Calculate. You will find that the value of the option changes to 7.671. By clicking on Display Tree the five-step tree is displayed, together with the values of  $u$ ,  $d$ ,  $a$ , and  $p$  calculated above.

DerivaGem can display trees that have up to 10 steps, but the calculations can be done for up to 500 steps. In our example, 500 steps gives the option price (to two decimal places) as 7.47. This is an accurate answer. By changing the Option Type to Binomial European, we can use the tree to value a European option. Using 500 time steps, the value of a European option with the same parameters as the American option is 6.76. (By changing the Option Type to Black-Scholes European, we can display the value of the option using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula that will be presented in Chapter 15. This is also 6.76.)

By changing the Underlying Type, we can consider options on assets other than stocks. These will now be discussed.

# 13.11 OPTIONS ON OTHER ASSETS

We introduced options on indices, currencies, and futures contracts in Chapter 10 and will cover them in more detail in Chapters 17 and 18. It turns out that we can construct and use binomial trees for these options in exactly the same way as for options on stocks except that the equation for  $p$  changes. As in the case of options on stocks, equation (13.2) applies so that the value at a node (before the possibility of early exercise is considered) is  $p$  times the value if there is an up movement plus  $1 - p$  times the value if there is a down movement, discounted at the risk-free rate.

# Options on Stocks Paying a Continuous Dividend Yield

Consider a stock paying a known dividend yield at rate  $q$ . The total return from dividends and capital gains in a risk-neutral world is  $r$ . The dividends provide a return of  $q$ . Capital gains must therefore provide a return of  $r - q$ . If the stock starts at  $S_0$ , its expected value after one time step of length  $\Delta t$  must be  $S_0 e^{(r - q)\Delta t}$ . This means that

$$ p S _ {0} u + (1 - p) S _ {0} d = S _ {0} e ^ {(r - q) \Delta t}
$$ so that


$$ p = \frac {e ^ {(r - q) \Delta t} - d}{u - d}
$$

As in the case of options on non-dividend-paying stocks, we match volatility by setting  $u = e^{\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}}$  and  $d = 1 / u$ . This means that we can use equations (13.15) to (13.18), except that we set  $a = e^{(r - q)\Delta t}$  instead of  $a = e^{r\Delta t}$ .

# Options on Stock Indices

When calculating a futures price for a stock index in Chapter 5 we assumed that the stocks underlying the index provided a dividend yield at rate  $q$ . We make a similar assumption here. The valuation of an option on a stock index is therefore very similar to the valuation of an option on a stock paying a known dividend yield.

# Example 13.1

A stock index is currently 810 and has a volatility of  $20\%$  and a dividend yield of  $2\%$ . The risk-free rate is  $5\%$ . Figure 13.11 shows the output from DerivaGem for valuing a European 6-month call option with a strike price of 800 using a two-step tree. In this case,

$$
\Delta t = 0. 2 5, \quad u = e ^ {0. 2 0 \times \sqrt {0 . 2 5}} = 1. 1 0 5 2,
$$

$$ d = 1 / u = 0. 9 0 4 8, \quad a = e ^ {(0. 0 5 - 0. 0 2) \times 0. 2 5} = 1. 0 0 7 5
$$

$$ p = (1. 0 0 7 5 - 0. 9 0 4 8) / (1. 1 0 5 2 - 0. 9 0 4 8) = 0. 5 1 2 6
$$

The value of the option is 53.39.

Upper value  $=$  Underlying Asset Price

Lower value  $=$  Option Price

# Options on Currencies

As pointed out in Section 5.10, a foreign currency can be regarded as an asset providing a yield at the foreign risk-free rate of interest,  $r_f$ . By analogy with the stock index case we can construct a tree for options on a currency by using equations (13.15) to (13.18) and setting  $a = e^{(r - r_f)\Delta t}$ .

# Example 13.2

A foreign currency is currently worth 0.6100 U.S. dollars and this exchange rate has a volatility of  $12\%$ . The foreign risk-free rate is  $7\%$  and the U.S. risk-free rate is  $5\%$ . Figure 13.12 shows the output from DerivaGem for valuing a 3-month American call option with a strike price of 0.6000 using a three-step tree. In this case,

$$
\Delta t = 0. 0 8 3 3 3, \quad u = e ^ {0. 1 2 \times \sqrt {0 . 0 8 3 3 3}} = 1. 0 3 5 2
$$

$$ d = 1 / u = 0. 9 6 6 0, \quad a = e ^ {(0. 0 5 - 0. 0 7) \times 0. 0 8 3 3 3} = 0. 9 9 8 3
$$

$$ p = (0. 9 9 8 3 - 0. 9 6 6 0) / (1. 0 3 5 2 - 0. 9 6 6 0) = 0. 4 6 7 3
$$

The value of the option is 0.019.

# Options on Futures

It costs nothing to take a long or a short position in a futures contract. It follows that in a risk-neutral world a futures price should have an expected growth rate of zero. (We discuss this point in more detail in Section 18.6.) As above, we define  $p$  as the probability of an up movement in the futures price,  $u$  as the percentage up movement, and  $d$  as the percentage down movement. If  $F_0$  is the initial futures price, the expected futures price at the end of one time step of length  $\Delta t$  should also be  $F_0$ . This means that

$$ p F _ {0} u + (1 - p) F _ {0} d = F _ {0}
$$ so that


$$ p = \frac {1 - d}{u - d}
$$ and we can use equations (13.15) to (13.18) with  $a = 1$ .


# Example 13.3

A futures price is currently 31 and has a volatility of  $30\%$ . The risk-free rate is  $5\%$ . Figure 13.13 shows the output from DerivaGem for valuing a 9-month American

# SUMMARY

This chapter has provided a first look at the valuation of options on stocks and other assets using trees. In the simple situation where movements in the price of a stock during the life of an option are governed by a one-step binomial tree, it is possible to set up a riskless portfolio consisting of a position in the stock option and a position in the stock. In a world with no arbitrage opportunities, riskless portfolios must earn the risk-free interest. This enables the stock option to be priced in terms of the stock. It is interesting to note that no assumptions are required about the actual (real-world) probabilities of up and down movements in the stock price.

When stock price movements are governed by a multistep binomial tree, we can treat each binomial step separately and work back from the end of the life of the option to the beginning to obtain the current value of the option. Again only no-arbitrage arguments are used, and no assumptions are required about the actual (real-world) probabilities of up and down movements in the stock price.

A very important principle states that we can assume the world is risk-neutral when valuing an option. This chapter has shown, through both numerical examples and algebra, that no-arbitrage arguments and risk-neutral valuation are equivalent and lead to the same option prices.

The delta of a stock option,  $\Delta$ , considers the effect of a small change in the underlying stock price on the change in the option price. It is the ratio of the change in the option price to the change in the stock price. For a riskless position, an investor should buy  $\Delta$  shares for each option sold. An inspection of a typical binomial tree shows that delta changes during the life of an option. This means that to hedge a particular option position, we must change our holding in the underlying stock periodically.

Constructing binomial trees for valuing options on stock indices, currencies, and futures contracts is very similar to doing so for valuing options on stocks. In Chapter 21, we will return to binomial trees and provide more details on how they are used in practice.

# APPENDIX

# DERIVATION OF THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON OPTION-PRICING FORMULA FROM A BINOMIAL TREE

One way of deriving the famous Black-Scholes-Merton result for valuing a European option on a non-dividend-paying stock is by allowing the number of time steps in a binomial tree to approach infinity.

Suppose that a tree with  $n$  time steps is used to value a European call option with strike price  $K$  and life  $T$ . Each step is of length  $T / n$ . If there have been  $j$  upward movements and  $n - j$  downward movements on the tree, the final stock price is  $S_0u^jd^{n - j}$ , where  $u$  is the proportional up movement,  $d$  is the proportional down movement, and  $S_0$  is the initial stock price. The payoff from a European call option is then

$$
\max  \left(S _ {0} u ^ {j} d ^ {n - j} - K, 0\right)
$$

From the properties of the binomial distribution, the probability of exactly  $j$  upward and  $n - j$  downward movements is given by

$$
\frac {n !}{(n - j) ! j !} p ^ {j} (1 - p) ^ {n - j}
$$

It follows that the expected payoff from the call option is

$$
\sum_ {j = 0} ^ {n} \frac {n !}{(n - j) ! j !} p ^ {j} (1 - p) ^ {n - j} \max  \left(S _ {0} u ^ {j} d ^ {n - j} - K, 0\right)
$$

As the tree represents movements in a risk-neutral world, we can discount this at the risk-free rate  $r$  to obtain the option price:

$$ c = e ^ {- r T} \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {n} \frac {n !}{(n - j) ! j !} p ^ {j} (1 - p) ^ {n - j} \max  \left(S _ {0} u ^ {j} d ^ {n - j} - K, 0\right) \tag {13A.1}
$$

The terms in equation (13A.1) are nonzero when the final stock price is greater than the strike price, that is, when

$$
S _ {0} u ^ {j} d ^ {n - j} > K
$$ or


$$

\ln \left(S _ {0} / K\right) > - j \ln (u) - (n - j) \ln (d)

$$

Since  $u = e^{\sigma \sqrt{T / n}}$  and  $d = e^{-\sigma \sqrt{T / n}}$ , this condition becomes

$$

\ln \left(S _ {0} / K\right) > n \sigma \sqrt {T / n} - 2 j \sigma \sqrt {T / n}

$$ or


$$ j > \frac {n}{2} - \frac {\ln \left(S _ {0} / K\right)}{2 \sigma \sqrt {T / n}}
$$

Equation (13A.1) can therefore be written

$$ c = e ^ {- r T} \sum_ {j > \alpha} \frac {n !}{(n - j) ! j !} p ^ {j} (1 - p) ^ {n - j} \left(S _ {0} u ^ {j} d ^ {n - j} - K\right)
$$ where


$$

\alpha = \frac {n}{2} - \frac {\ln (S _ {0} / K)}{2 \sigma \sqrt {T / n}}

$$

For convenience, we define

$$

U _ {1} = \sum_ {j > \alpha} \frac {n !}{(n - j) ! j !} p ^ {j} (1 - p) ^ {n - j} u ^ {j} d ^ {n - j} \tag {13A.2}

$$ and


$$

U _ {2} = \sum_ {j > \alpha} \frac {n !}{(n - j) ! j !} p ^ {j} (1 - p) ^ {n - j} \tag {13A.3}

$$ so that


$$ c = e ^ {- r T} \left(S _ {0} U _ {1} - K U _ {2}\right) \tag {13A.4}
$$

Consider first  $U_{2}$ . As is well known, the binomial distribution approaches a normal distribution as the number of trials approaches infinity. Specifically, when there are  $n$  trials and  $p$  is the probability of success, the probability distribution of the number of successes is approximately normal with mean  $np$  and standard deviation  $\sqrt{np(1 - p)}$ . The variable  $U_{2}$  in equation (13A.3) is the probability of the number of successes being more than  $\alpha$ . From the properties of the normal distribution, it follows that, for large  $n$ ,

$$
U _ {2} = N \left(\frac {n p - \alpha}{\sqrt {n p (1 - p)}}\right) \tag {13A.5}
$$ where  $N$  is the cumulative probability distribution function for a standard normal variable. Substituting for  $\alpha$ , we obtain


$$

U _ {2} = N \left(\frac {\ln \left(S _ {0} / K\right)}{2 \sigma \sqrt {T} \sqrt {p (1 - p)}} + \frac {\sqrt {n} \left(p - \frac {1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt {p (1 - p)}}\right) \tag {13A.6}

$$

From equations (13.15) to (13.18), we have

$$ p = \frac {e ^ {r T / n} - e ^ {- \sigma \sqrt {T / n}}}{e ^ {\sigma \sqrt {T / n}} - e ^ {- \sigma \sqrt {T / n}}}
$$

By expanding the exponential functions in a series, we see that, as  $n$  tends to infinity,  $p(1 - p)$  tends to  $\frac{1}{4}$  and  $\sqrt{n} (p - \frac{1}{2})$  tends to

$$
\frac {(r - \sigma^ {2} / 2) \sqrt {T}}{2 \sigma}
$$ so that in the limit, as  $n$  tends to infinity, equation (13A.6) becomes


$$

U _ {2} = N \left(\frac {\ln \left(S _ {0} / K\right) + (r - \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}\right) \tag {13A.7}

$$

We now move on to evaluate  $U_{1}$ . From equation (13A.2), we have

$$

U _ {1} = \sum_ {j > \alpha} \frac {n !}{(n - j) ! j !} (p u) ^ {j} [ (1 - p) d ] ^ {n - j} \tag {13A.8}

$$

Define

$$ p ^ {*} = \frac {p u}{p u + (1 - p) d} \tag {13A.9}
$$

It then follows that

$$
1 - p ^ {*} = \frac {(1 - p) d}{p u + (1 - p) d}
$$ and we can write equation (13A.8) as


$$

U _ {1} = [ p u + (1 - p) d ] ^ {n} \sum_ {j > \alpha} \frac {n !}{(n - j) ! j !} (p ^ {*}) ^ {j} (1 - p ^ {*}) ^ {n - j}

$$

Since the expected rate of return in the risk-neutral world is the risk-free rate  $r$ , it follows that  $pu + (1 - p)d = e^{rT / n}$  and

$$

U _ {1} = e ^ {r T} \sum_ {j > \alpha} \frac {n !}{(n - j) ! j !} (p ^ {*}) ^ {j} (1 - p ^ {*}) ^ {n - j}

$$

This shows that  $U_{1}$  involves a binomial distribution where the probability of an up movement is  $p^{*}$  rather than  $p$ . Approximating the binomial distribution with a normal distribution, we obtain, similarly to equation (13A.5),

$$

U _ {1} = e ^ {r T} N \left(\frac {n p ^ {*} - \alpha}{\sqrt {n p ^ {*} (1 - p ^ {*})}}\right)

$$ and substituting for  $\alpha$  gives, as with equation (13A.6),

$$
U _ {1} = e ^ {r T} N \Bigg (\frac {\ln (S _ {0} / K)}{2 \sigma \sqrt {T} \sqrt {p ^ {*} (1 - p ^ {*})}} + \frac {\sqrt {n} (p ^ {*} - \frac {1}{2})}{\sqrt {p ^ {*} (1 - p ^ {*})}} \Bigg)
$$

Substituting for  $u$  and  $d$  in equation (13A.9) gives

$$ p ^ {*} = \left(\frac {e ^ {r T / n} - e ^ {- \sigma \sqrt {T / n}}}{e ^ {\sigma \sqrt {T / n}} - e ^ {- \sigma \sqrt {T / n}}}\right) \left(\frac {e ^ {\sigma \sqrt {T / n}}}{e ^ {r T / n}}\right)
$$

By expanding the exponential functions in a series we see that, as  $n$  tends to infinity,  $p^*(1 - p^*)$  tends to  $\frac{1}{4}$  and  $\sqrt{n}(p^* - \frac{1}{2})$  tends to

$$
\frac {(r + \sigma^ {2} / 2) \sqrt {T}}{2 \sigma}
$$ with the result that


$$

U _ {1} = e ^ {r T} N \left(\frac {\ln \left(S _ {0} / K\right) + (r + \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}\right) \tag {13A.10}

$$

From equations (13A.4), (13A.7), and (13A.10), we have

$$ c = S _ {0} N \left(d _ {1}\right) - K e ^ {- r T} N \left(d _ {2}\right)
$$ where


$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (S _ {0} / K) + (r + \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}
$$ and


$$ d _ {2} = \frac {\ln \left(S _ {0} / K\right) + (r - \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}} = d _ {1} - \sigma \sqrt {T}
$$

This is the Black-Scholes-Merton formula for the valuation of a European call option. It will be discussed in Chapter 15. An alternative derivation is given in the appendix to that chapter.

# CHAPTER

# Wiener Processes and Ito's Lemma

Any variable whose value changes over time in an uncertain way is said to follow a stochastic process. Stochastic processes can be classified as discrete time or continuous time. A discrete-time stochastic process is one where the value of the variable can change only at certain fixed points in time, whereas a continuous-time stochastic process is one where changes can take place at any time. Stochastic processes can also be classified as continuous variable or discrete variable. In a continuous-variable process, the underlying variable can take any value within a certain range, whereas in a discrete-variable process, only certain discrete values are possible.

This chapter develops a continuous-variable, continuous-time stochastic process for stock prices. A similar process is often assumed for the prices of other assets. Learning about this process is the first step to understanding the pricing of options and other more complicated derivatives. It should be noted that, in practice, we do not observe stock prices following continuous-variable, continuous-time processes. Stock prices are restricted to discrete values (e.g., multiples of a cent) and changes can be observed only when the exchange is open for trading. Nevertheless, the continuous-variable, continuous-time process proves to be a useful model for many purposes.

Many people feel that continuous-time stochastic processes are so complicated that they should be left entirely to "rocket scientists." This is not so. The biggest hurdle to understanding these processes is the notation. Here we present a step-by-step approach aimed at getting the reader over this hurdle. We also explain an important result known as Itô's lemma that is central to the pricing of derivatives.

# 14.1 THE MARKOV PROPERTY

A Markov process is a particular type of stochastic process where only the current value of a variable is relevant for predicting the future. The past history of the variable and the way that the present has emerged from the past are irrelevant.

Stock prices are usually assumed to follow a Markov process. Suppose that the price of a stock is 100 now. If the stock price follows a Markov process, our predictions for the future should be unaffected by the price one week ago, one month ago, or one year ago. The only relevant piece of information is that the price is now 100.^{1} Predictions for the future are uncertain and must be expressed in terms of probability distributions. The Markov property implies that the probability distribution of the price at any particular future time is not dependent on the particular path followed by the price in the past.

The Markov property of stock prices is consistent with the weak form of market efficiency. This states that the present price of a stock impounds all the information contained in a record of past prices. If the weak form of market efficiency were not true, technical analysts could make above-average returns by interpreting charts of the past history of stock prices. There is very little evidence that they are in fact able to do this.

It is competition in the marketplace that tends to ensure that weak-form market efficiency and the Markov property hold. There are many investors watching the stock market closely. This leads to a situation where a stock price, at any given time, reflects the information in past prices. Suppose that it was discovered that a particular pattern in a stock price always gave a  $65\%$  chance of subsequent steep price rises. Investors would attempt to buy a stock as soon as the pattern was observed, and demand for the stock would immediately rise. This would lead to an immediate rise in its price and the observed effect would be eliminated, as would any profitable trading opportunities.

# 14.2 CONTINUOUS-TIME STOCHASTIC PROCESSES

Consider a variable that follows a Markov stochastic process. Suppose that its current value is 10 and that the change in its value during a year is  $\phi(0,1)$ , where  $\phi(m,\nu)$  denotes a probability distribution that is normally distributed with mean  $m$  and variance  $\nu$ . What is the probability distribution of the change in the value of the variable during 2 years?

The change in 2 years is the sum of two normal distributions, each of which has a mean of zero and variance of 1.0. Because the variable is Markov, the two probability distributions are independent. When we add two independent normal distributions, the result is a normal distribution where the mean is the sum of the means and the variance is the sum of the variances. The mean of the change during 2 years in the variable we are considering is, therefore, zero and the variance of this change is 2.0. Hence, the change in the variable over 2 years has the distribution  $\phi(0, 2)$ . The standard deviation of the change is  $\sqrt{2}$ .

Consider next the change in the variable during 6 months. The variance of the change in the value of the variable during 1 year equals the variance of the change during the first 6 months plus the variance of the change during the second 6 months. We assume these are the same. It follows that the variance of the change during a 6-month period must be 0.5. Equivalently, the standard deviation of the change is  $\sqrt{0.5}$ . The probability distribution for the change in the value of the variable during 6 months is  $\phi(0, 0.5)$ .

A similar argument shows that the probability distribution for the change in the value of the variable during 3 months is  $\phi(0, 0.25)$ . More generally, the change during any time period of length  $T$  is  $\phi(0, T)$ . In particular, the change during a very short time period of length  $\Delta t$  is  $\phi(0, \Delta t)$ .

Note that, when Markov processes are considered, the variances of the changes in successive time periods are additive. The standard deviations of the changes in successive time periods are not additive. The variance of the change in the variable in our example is 1.0 per year, so that the variance of the change in 2 years is 2.0 and the variance of the change in 3 years is 3.0. The standard deviations of the changes in 2 and 3 years are  $\sqrt{2}$  and  $\sqrt{3}$ , respectively. Uncertainty is often measured by standard deviation. These results therefore explain why uncertainty is sometimes referred to as being proportional to the square root of time.

# Wiener Process

The process followed by the variable we have been considering is known as a Wiener process. It is a particular type of Markov stochastic process with a mean change of zero and a variance rate of 1.0 per year. It has been used in physics to describe the motion of a particle that is subject to a large number of small molecular shocks and is sometimes referred to as Brownian motion.

Expressed formally, a variable  $z$  follows a Wiener process if it has the following two properties:

Property 1. The change  $\Delta z$  during a small period of time  $\Delta t$  is

$$
\Delta z = \epsilon \sqrt {\Delta t} \tag {14.1}
$$ where  $\epsilon$  has a standard normal distribution  $\phi(0,1)$ .


Property 2. The values of  $\Delta z$  for any two different short intervals of time,  $\Delta t$ , are independent.

It follows from the first property that  $\Delta z$  itself has a normal distribution with

$$

\text {m e a n} \Delta z = 0

$$

$$

\text {s t a n d a r d} \Delta z = \sqrt {\Delta t}

$$

$$

\text {v a r i a n c e} \Delta z = \Delta t

$$

The second property implies that  $z$  follows a Markov process.

Consider the change in the value of  $z$  during a relatively long period of time,  $T$ . This can be denoted by  $z(T) - z(0)$ . It can be regarded as the sum of the changes in  $z$  in  $N$  small time intervals of length  $\Delta t$ , where

$$

N = \frac {T}{\Delta t}

$$

Thus,

$$ z (T) - z (0) = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \epsilon_ {i} \sqrt {\Delta t} \tag {14.2}
$$ where the  $\epsilon_{i}(i = 1,2,\ldots ,N)$  are distributed  $\phi (0,1)$ . We know from the second property of Wiener processes that the  $\epsilon_{i}$  are independent of each other. It follows


from equation (14.2) that  $z(T) - z(0)$  is normally distributed, with

$$

\text {m e a n} [ z (T) - z (0) ] = 0

$$

$$

\text {v a r i a n c e} [ z (T) - z (0) ] = N \Delta t = T

$$

$$

\text {s t a n d a r d} [ z (T) - z (0) ] = \sqrt {T}

$$

This is consistent with the discussion earlier in this section.

# Example 14.1

Suppose that the value,  $z$ , of a variable that follows a Wiener process is initially 25 and that time is measured in years. At the end of 1 year, the value of the variable is normally distributed with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 1.0. At the end of 5 years, it is normally distributed with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of  $\sqrt{5}$ , or 2.236. Our uncertainty about the value of the variable at a certain time in the future, as measured by its standard deviation, increases as the square root of how far we are looking ahead.

In ordinary calculus, it is usual to proceed from small changes to the limit as the small changes become closer to zero. Thus,  $dx = a dt$  is the notation used to indicate that  $\Delta x = a \Delta t$  in the limit as  $\Delta t \to 0$ . We use similar notational conventions in stochastic calculus. So, when we refer to  $dz$  as a Wiener process, we mean that it has the properties for  $\Delta z$  given above in the limit as  $\Delta t \to 0$ .

Figure 14.1 illustrates what happens to the path followed by  $z$  as the limit  $\Delta t \to 0$  is approached. Note that the path is quite "jagged." This is because the standard deviation of the movement in  $z$  in time  $\Delta t$  equals  $\sqrt{\Delta t}$  and, when  $\Delta t$  is small,  $\sqrt{\Delta t}$  is much bigger than  $\Delta t$ . Two intriguing properties of Wiener processes, related to this  $\sqrt{\Delta t}$  property, are as follows:

1. The expected length of the path followed by  $z$  in any time interval is infinite.
2. The expected number of times  $z$  equals any particular value in any time interval is infinite.

# Generalized Wiener Process

The mean change per unit time for a stochastic process is known as the drift rate and the variance per unit time is known as the variance rate. The basic Wiener process,  $dz$ , that has been developed so far has a drift rate of zero and a variance rate of 1.0. The drift rate of zero means that the expected value of  $z$  at any future time is equal to its current value. The variance rate of 1.0 means that the variance of the change in  $z$  in a time interval of length  $T$  equals  $T$ . A generalized Wiener process for a variable  $x$  can be defined in terms of  $dz$  as

$$ d x = a d t + b d z \tag {14.3}
$$ where  $a$  and  $b$  are constants.


To understand equation (14.3), it is useful to consider the two components on the right-hand side separately. The  $a$  term implies that  $x$  has an expected drift rate of  $a$  per unit of time. Without the  $b$  term, the equation is  $dx = a$  dt, which implies that

$dx / dt = a$ . Integrating with respect to time, we get

$$ x = x _ {0} + a t
$$ where  $x_0$  is the value of  $x$  at time 0. In a period of time of length  $T$ , the variable  $x$  increases by an amount  $aT$ . The  $b \, dz$  term on the right-hand side of equation (14.3) can be regarded as adding noise or variability to the path followed by  $x$ . The amount of this noise or variability is  $b$  times a Wiener process. A Wiener process has a variance rate per unit time of 1.0. It follows that  $b$  times a Wiener process has a variance rate per unit time of  $b^2$ . In a small time interval  $\Delta t$ , the change  $\Delta x$  in the value of  $x$  is given by equations (14.1) and (14.3) as


$$

\Delta x = a \Delta t + b \epsilon \sqrt {\Delta t}

$$ where, as before,  $\epsilon$  has a standard normal distribution  $\phi(0,1)$ . Thus  $\Delta x$  has a normal distribution with

mean of  $\Delta x = a\Delta t$ standard deviation of  $\Delta x = b\sqrt{\Delta t}$

variance of  $\Delta x = b^{2}\Delta t$

Similar arguments to those given for a Wiener process show that the change in the value of  $x$  in any time interval  $T$  is normally distributed with mean of change in  $x = aT$

standard deviation of change in  $x = b\sqrt{T}$ variance of change in  $x = b^{2}T$

To summarize, the generalized Wiener process given in equation (14.3) has an expected drift rate (i.e., average drift per unit of time) of  $a$  and a variance rate (i.e., variance per unit of time) of  $b^2$ . It is illustrated in Figure 14.2.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/fbb93b0ec1e92c885a7ebd79c61b4ddc2d5ae7c533153a8db36b644fd7c6d735.jpg)

Figure 14.2 Generalized Wiener process with  $a = 0.3$  and  $b = 1.5$ .

# Example 14.2

Consider the situation where the cash position of a company, measured in thousands of dollars, follows a generalized Wiener process with a drift of 20 per year and a variance rate of 900 per year. Initially, the cash position is 50. At the end of 1 year the cash position will have a normal distribution with a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of  $\sqrt{900}$ , or 30. At the end of 6 months it will have a normal distribution with a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of  $30\sqrt{0.5} = 21.21$ . Our uncertainty about the cash position at some time in the future, as measured by its standard deviation, increases as the square root of how far ahead we are looking. (Note that the cash position can become negative. We can interpret this as a situation where the company is borrowing funds.)

# Ito Process

A further type of stochastic process, known as an Itô process, can be defined. This is a generalized Wiener process in which the parameters  $a$  and  $b$  are functions of the value of the underlying variable  $x$  and time  $t$ . An Itô process can therefore be written as

$$ d x = a (x, t) d t + b (x, t) d z \tag {14.4}
$$

Both the expected drift rate and variance rate of an Ito process are liable to change over time. They are functions of the current value of  $x$  and the current time,  $t$ . In a small time interval between  $t$  and  $t + \Delta t$ , the variable changes from  $x$  to  $x + \Delta x$ , where

$$
\Delta x = a (x, t) \Delta t + b (x, t) \epsilon \sqrt {\Delta t}
$$

This equation involves a small approximation. It assumes that the drift and variance rate of  $x$  remain constant, equal to their values at time  $t$ , in the time interval between  $t$  and  $t + \Delta t$ .

Note that the process in equation (14.4) is Markov because the change in  $x$  at time  $t$  depends only on the value of  $x$  at time  $t$ , not on its history. A non-Markov process could be defined by letting  $a$  and  $b$  in equation (14.4) depend on values of  $x$  prior to time  $t$ .

# 14.3 THE PROCESS FOR A STOCK PRICE

In this section we discuss the stochastic process usually assumed for the price of a non-dividend-paying stock.

It is tempting to suggest that a stock price follows a generalized Wiener process; that is, that it has a constant expected drift rate and a constant variance rate. However, this model fails to capture a key aspect of stock prices. This is that the expected percentage return required by investors from a stock is independent of the stock's price. If investors require a  $14\%$  per annum expected return when the stock price is  $10, then, ceteris paribus, they will also require a 14\%$  per annum expected return when it is 50.

Clearly, the assumption of constant expected drift rate is inappropriate and needs to be replaced by the assumption that the expected return (i.e., expected drift divided by the stock price) is constant. If  $S$  is the stock price at time  $t$ , then the expected drift rate in  $S$  should be assumed to be  $\mu S$  for some constant parameter  $\mu$ . This means that in a short interval of time,  $\Delta t$ , the expected increase in  $S$  is  $\mu S \Delta t$ . The parameter  $\mu$  is the expected rate of return on the stock.

If the coefficient of  $dz$  is zero, so that there is no uncertainty, then this model implies that

$$
\Delta S = \mu S \Delta t
$$ in the limit, as  $\Delta t\to 0$  , so that:


$$ d S = \mu S d t
$$ or


$$

\frac {d S}{S} = \mu d t

$$

Integrating between time 0 and time  $T$ , we get

$$

S _ {T} = S _ {0} e ^ {\mu T} \tag {14.5}

$$ where  $S_0$  and  $S_T$  are the stock price at time 0 and time  $T$ . Equation (14.5) shows that, when there is no uncertainty, the stock price grows at a continuously compounded rate of  $\mu$  per unit of time.

In practice, of course, there is uncertainty. A reasonable assumption is that the variability of the return in a short period of time,  $\Delta t$ , is the same regardless of the stock price. In other words, an investor is just as uncertain about the return when the stock price is  $50 as when it is$ 10. This suggests that the standard deviation of the change in a short period of time  $\Delta t$  should be proportional to the stock price and leads to the model

$$ d S = \mu S d t + \sigma S d z
$$ or


$$

\frac {d S}{S} = \mu d t + \sigma d z \tag {14.6}

$$

Equation (14.6) is the most widely used model of stock price behavior. The variable  $\mu$  is the stock's expected rate of return. The variable  $\sigma$  is the volatility of the stock price. The variable  $\sigma^2$  is referred to as its variance rate. The model in equation (14.6) represents the stock price process in the real world. In a risk-neutral world,  $\mu$  equals the risk-free rate  $r$ .

# Discrete-Time Model

The model of stock price behavior we have developed is known as geometric Brownian motion. The discrete-time version of the model is

$$

\frac {\Delta S}{S} = \mu \Delta t + \sigma \epsilon \sqrt {\Delta t} \tag {14.7}

$$ or


$$

\Delta S = \mu S \Delta t + \sigma S \epsilon \sqrt {\Delta t} \tag {14.8}

$$

The variable  $\Delta S$  is the change in the stock price  $S$  in a small time interval  $\Delta t$ , and as before  $\epsilon$  has a standard normal distribution (i.e., a normal distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1.0). The parameter  $\mu$  is the expected rate of return per unit of time from the stock. The parameter  $\sigma$  is the stock price volatility. In this chapter we will assume these parameters are constant.

The left-hand side of equation (14.7) is the discrete approximation to the return provided by the stock in a short period of time,  $\Delta t$ . The term  $\mu \Delta t$  is the expected value of this return, and the term  $\sigma \epsilon \sqrt{\Delta t}$  is the stochastic component of the return. The variance of the stochastic component (and, therefore, of the whole return) is  $\sigma^2\Delta t$ . This is consistent with the definition of the volatility  $\sigma$  given in Section 13.7; that is,  $\sigma$  is such that  $\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}$  is the standard deviation of the return in a short time period  $\Delta t$ .


Equation (14.7) shows that  $\Delta S / S$  is approximately normally distributed with mean  $\mu \Delta t$  and standard deviation  $\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}$ . In other words,

$$

\frac {\Delta S}{S} \sim \phi (\mu \Delta t, \sigma^ {2} \Delta t) \tag {14.9}

$$

# Example 14.3

Consider a stock that pays no dividends, has a volatility of  $30\%$  per annum, and provides an expected return of  $15\%$  per annum with continuous compounding. In this case,  $\mu = 0.15$  and  $\sigma = 0.30$ . The process for the stock price is

$$

\frac {d S}{S} = 0. 1 5 d t + 0. 3 0 d z

$$

If  $S$  is the stock price at a particular time and  $\Delta S$  is the increase in the stock price in the next small interval of time, the discrete approximation to the process is

$$

\frac {\Delta S}{S} = 0. 1 5 \Delta t + 0. 3 0 \epsilon \sqrt {\Delta t}

$$ where  $\epsilon$  has a standard normal distribution. Consider a time interval of 1 week, or 0.0192 year, so that  $\Delta t = 0.0192$ . Then the approximation gives

$$
\frac {\Delta S}{S} = 0. 1 5 \times 0. 0 1 9 2 + 0. 3 0 \times \sqrt {0 . 0 1 9 2} \epsilon
$$ or


$$

\Delta S = 0. 0 0 2 8 8 S + 0. 0 4 1 6 S \epsilon

$$

# Monte Carlo Simulation

A Monte Carlo simulation of a stochastic process is a procedure for sampling random outcomes for the process. We will use it as a way of developing some understanding of the nature of the stock price process in equation (14.6).

Consider the situation in Example 14.3 where the expected return from a stock is  $15\%$  per annum and the volatility is  $30\%$  per annum. The stock price change over 1 week was shown to be approximately

$$

\Delta S = 0. 0 0 2 8 8 S + 0. 0 4 1 6 S \epsilon \tag {14.10}

$$

A path for the stock price over 10 weeks can be simulated by sampling repeatedly for  $\epsilon$  from  $\phi(0,1)$  and substituting into equation (14.10). The expression  $= \text{RAND}()$  in Excel produces a random sample between 0 and 1. The inverse cumulative normal distribution is NORMSINV. The instruction to produce a random sample from a standard normal distribution in Excel is therefore  $= \text{NORMSINV}(\text{RAND})$ . Table 14.1 shows one path for a stock price that was sampled in this way. The initial stock price is assumed to be $100. For the first period,  $\epsilon$  is sampled as 0.52. From equation (14.10), the change during the first time period is

$$

\Delta S = 0. 0 0 2 8 8 \times 1 0 0 + 0. 0 4 1 6 \times 1 0 0 \times 0. 5 2 = 2. 4 5

$$

Therefore, at the beginning of the second time period, the stock price is 102.45. The

Table 14.1 Simulation of stock price when  $\mu = 0.15$  and  $\sigma = 0.30$  during 1-week periods.

value of  $\epsilon$  sampled for the next period is 1.44. From equation (14.10), the change during the second time period is

$$

\Delta S = 0. 0 0 2 8 8 \times 1 0 2. 4 5 + 0. 0 4 1 6 \times 1 0 2. 4 5 \times 1. 4 4 = 6. 4 3

$$

So, at the beginning of the next period, the stock price is 108.88, and so on.4 Note that, because the process we are simulating is Markov, the samples for ε should be independent of each other.

Table 14.1 assumes that stock prices are measured to the nearest cent. It is important to realize that the table shows only one possible pattern of stock price movements. Different random samples would lead to different price movements. Any small time interval  $\Delta t$  can be used in the simulation. In the limit as  $\Delta t\to 0$ , a perfect description of the stochastic process is obtained. The final stock price of 111.54 in Table 14.1 can be regarded as a random sample from the distribution of stock prices at the end of 10 weeks. By repeatedly simulating movements in the stock price, a complete probability distribution of the stock price at the end of this time is obtained. Monte Carlo simulation is discussed in more detail in Chapter 21.

# 14.4 THE PARAMETERS

The process for a stock price developed in this chapter involves two parameters,  $\mu$  and  $\sigma$ . The parameter  $\mu$  is the expected return (annualized) earned by an investor in a short period of time. Most investors require higher expected returns to induce them to take higher risks. It follows that the value of  $\mu$  should depend on the risk of the return from the stock. It should also depend on the level of interest rates in the economy. The higher the level of interest rates, the higher the expected return required on any given stock.

Fortunately, we do not have to concern ourselves with the determinants of  $\mu$  in any detail because the value of a derivative dependent on a stock is, in general, independent of  $\mu$ . The parameter  $\sigma$ , the stock price volatility, is, by contrast, critically important to the determination of the value of many derivatives. We will discuss procedures for estimating  $\sigma$  in Chapter 15. Typical values of  $\sigma$  for a stock are in the range 0.15 to 0.60 (i.e.,  $15\%$  to  $60\%$ ).

The standard deviation of the proportional change in the stock price in a small interval of time  $\Delta t$  is  $\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}$ . As a rough approximation, the standard deviation of the proportional change in the stock price over a relatively long period of time  $T$  is  $\sigma \sqrt{T}$ . This means that, as an approximation, volatility can be interpreted as the standard deviation of the change in the stock price in 1 year. In Chapter 15, we will show that the volatility of a stock price is exactly equal to the standard deviation of the continuously compounded return provided by the stock in 1 year.

# 14.5 CORRELATED PROCESSES

So far we have considered how the stochastic process for a single variable can be represented. We now extend the analysis to the situation where there are two or more variables following correlated stochastic processes. Suppose that the processes followed by two variables  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$  are

$$ d x _ {1} = a _ {1} d t + b _ {1} d z _ {1} \quad \text {a n d} \quad d x _ {2} = a _ {2} d t + b _ {2} d z _ {2}
$$ where  $dz_{1}$  and  $dz_{2}$  are Wiener processes.


As has been explained, the discrete-time approximations for these processes are

$$

\Delta x _ {1} = a _ {1} \Delta t + b _ {1} \epsilon_ {1} \sqrt {\Delta t} \quad \text {a n d} \quad \Delta x _ {2} = a _ {2} \Delta t + b _ {2} \epsilon_ {2} \sqrt {\Delta t}

$$ where  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$  are samples from a standard normal distribution  $\phi (0,1)$ .

The variables  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$  can be simulated in the way described in Section 14.3. If they are uncorrelated with each other, the random samples  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$  that are used to obtain movements in a particular period of time  $\Delta t$  should be independent of each other.

If  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$  have a nonzero correlation  $\rho$ , then the  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$  that are used to obtain movements in a particular period of time should be sampled from a bivariate normal distribution. Each variable in the bivariate normal distribution has a standard normal distribution and the correlation between the variables is  $\rho$ . In this situation, we would refer to the Wiener processes  $dz_{1}$  and  $dz_{2}$  as having a correlation  $\rho$ .

Obtaining samples for uncorrelated standard normal variables in cells in Excel involves putting the instruction "=NORMINV(RAND())" in each of the cells. To sample standard normal variables  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$  with correlation  $\rho$ , we can set

$$
\epsilon_ {1} = u \quad \text {a n d} \quad \epsilon_ {2} = \rho u + \sqrt {1 - \rho^ {2}} v
$$ where  $u$  and  $\nu$  are sampled as uncorrelated variables with standard normal distributions.


Note that, in the processes we have assumed for  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$ , the parameters  $a_{1}, a_{2}, b_{1}$  and  $b_{2}$  can be functions of  $x_{1}, x_{2}$ , and  $t$ . In particular,  $a_{1}$  and  $b_{1}$  can be functions of  $x_{2}$  as well as  $x_{1}$  and  $t$ ; and  $a_{2}$  and  $b_{2}$  can be functions of  $x_{1}$  as well as  $x_{2}$  and  $t$ .

The results here can be generalized. When there are three different variables following correlated stochastic processes, we have to sample three different  $\epsilon$ 's. These have a trivariate normal distribution. When there are  $n$  correlated variables, we have  $n$  different  $\epsilon$ 's and these must be sampled from an appropriate multivariate normal distribution. The way this is done is explained in Chapter 21.

# 14.6 ITO'S LEMMA

The price of a stock option is a function of the underlying stock's price and time. More generally, we can say that the price of any derivative is a function of the stochastic variables underlying the derivative and time. A serious student of derivatives must, therefore, acquire some understanding of the behavior of functions of stochastic variables. An important result in this area was discovered by the mathematician K. Itô in 1951, $^{6}$  and is known as Itô's lemma.

Suppose that the value of a variable  $x$  follows the Itô process

$$ d x = a (x, t) d t + b (x, t) d z \tag {14.11}
$$ where  $dz$  is a Wiener process and  $a$  and  $b$  are functions of  $x$  and  $t$ . The variable  $x$  has a drift rate of  $a$  and a variance rate of  $b^2$ . Itô's lemma shows that a function  $G$  of  $x$  and  $t$  follows the process


$$ d G = \left(\frac {\partial G}{\partial x} a + \frac {\partial G}{\partial t} + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} G}{\partial x ^ {2}} b ^ {2}\right) d t + \frac {\partial G}{\partial x} b d z \tag {14.12}
$$ where the  $dz$  is the same Wiener process as in equation (14.11). Thus,  $G$  also follows an Itô process, with a drift rate of


$$

\frac {\partial G}{\partial x} a + \frac {\partial G}{\partial t} + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} G}{\partial x ^ {2}} b ^ {2}

$$ and a variance rate of


$$

\left(\frac {\partial G}{\partial x}\right) ^ {2} b ^ {2}

$$

A completely rigorous proof of Ito's lemma is beyond the scope of this book. In the appendix to this chapter, we show that the lemma can be viewed as an extension of well-known results in differential calculus.

Earlier, we argued that

$$ d S = \mu S d t + \sigma S d z \tag {14.13}
$$ with  $\mu$  and  $\sigma$  constant, is a reasonable model of stock price movements. From Itô's lemma, it follows that the process followed by a function  $G$  of  $S$  and  $t$  is


$$ d G = \left(\frac {\partial G}{\partial S} \mu S + \frac {\partial G}{\partial t} + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} G}{\partial S ^ {2}} \sigma^ {2} S ^ {2}\right) d t + \frac {\partial G}{\partial S} \sigma S d z \tag {14.14}
$$

Note that both  $S$  and  $G$  are affected by the same underlying source of uncertainty,  $dz$ . This proves to be very important in the derivation of the Black-Scholes-Merton results.

# Application to Forward Contracts

To illustrate Ito's lemma, consider a forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock. Assume that the risk-free rate of interest is constant and equal to  $r$  for all maturities. From equation (5.1),

$$
F _ {0} = S _ {0} e ^ {r T}
$$ where  $F_{0}$  is the forward price at time zero,  $S_{0}$  is the spot price at time zero, and  $T$  is the time to maturity of the forward contract.


We are interested in what happens to the forward price as time passes. We define  $F$  as the forward price at a general time  $t$ , and  $S$  as the stock price at time  $t$ , with  $t < T$ . The relationship between  $F$  and  $S$  is given by

$$

F = S e ^ {r (T - t)} \tag {14.15}

$$

Assuming that the process for  $S$  is given by equation (14.13), we can use Ito's lemma to determine the process for  $F$ . From equation (14.15),

$$

\frac {\partial F}{\partial S} = e ^ {r (T - t)}, \quad \frac {\partial^ {2} F}{\partial S ^ {2}} = 0, \quad \frac {\partial F}{\partial t} = - r S e ^ {r (T - t)}

$$

From equation (14.14), the process for  $F$  is given by

$$ d F = \left[ e ^ {r (T - t)} \mu S - r S e ^ {r (T - t)} \right] d t + e ^ {r (T - t)} \sigma S d z
$$

Substituting  $F$  for  $S e^{r(T - t)}$  gives

$$ d F = (\mu - r) F d t + \sigma F d z \tag {14.16}
$$

Like  $S$ , the forward price  $F$  follows geometric Brownian motion. It has the same volatility as  $S$  and an expected growth rate of  $\mu - r$  rather than  $\mu$ .

# 14.7 THE LOGNORMAL PROPERTY

We now use Ito's lemma to derive the process followed by  $\ln S$  when  $S$  follows the process in equation (14.13). We define

$$
G = \ln S
$$

Since

$$
\frac {\partial G}{\partial S} = \frac {1}{S}, \quad \frac {\partial^ {2} G}{\partial S ^ {2}} = - \frac {1}{S ^ {2}}, \quad \frac {\partial G}{\partial t} = 0
$$ it follows from equation (14.14) that the process followed by  $G$  is


$$ d G = \left(\mu - \frac {\sigma^ {2}}{2}\right) d t + \sigma d z \tag {14.17}
$$

Since  $\mu$  and  $\sigma$  are constant, this equation indicates that  $G = \ln S$  follows a generalized Wiener process. It has constant drift rate  $\mu -\sigma^2 /2$  and constant variance rate  $\sigma^2$ . The change in  $\ln S$  between time 0 and some future time  $T$  is therefore normally distributed, with mean  $(\mu - \sigma^2 / 2)T$  and variance  $\sigma^2 T$ . This means that

$$
\ln S _ {T} - \ln S _ {0} \sim \phi \left[ \left(\mu - \frac {\sigma^ {2}}{2}\right) T, \sigma^ {2} T \right] \tag {14.18}
$$ or


$$

\ln S _ {T} \sim \phi \left[ \ln S _ {0} + \left(\mu - \frac {\sigma^ {2}}{2}\right) T, \sigma^ {2} T \right] \tag {14.19}

$$ where  $S_{T}$  is the stock price at time  $T$ ,  $S_{0}$  is the stock price at time 0, and as before  $\phi(m, \nu)$  denotes a normal distribution with mean  $m$  and variance  $\nu$ .

Equation (14.19) shows that  $\ln S_T$  is normally distributed. A variable has a lognormal distribution if the natural logarithm of the variable is normally distributed. The model of stock price behavior we have developed in this chapter therefore implies that a stock's price at time  $T$ , given its price today, is lognormally distributed. The standard deviation of the logarithm of the stock price is  $\sigma \sqrt{T}$ . It is proportional to the square root of how far ahead we are looking.

# 14.8 FRACTIONAL BROWNIAN MOTION

Fractional Brownian motion (also known as fractal Brownian motion) provides a generalization of Brownian motion and the models involving Wiener processes that we have discussed so far in this chapter. It is used in rough volatility models for valuing derivatives, which are discussed later in the book.

First, let us quickly review the properties of Wiener processes. Suppose  $dz$  is a Wiener process,  $\sigma$  is a constant, and

$$
X = \sigma d z
$$ with  $X(0) = 0$ . Then, for  $t > s > 0$ ,


$$

E [ X (t) - X (s) ] = 0 \quad \text {a n d} \quad E [ (X (t) - X (s)) ^ {2} ] = \sigma^ {2} (t - s)

$$

In particular,  $E[(X(t))^2] = \sigma^2 t$  and  $E[(X(s))^2] = \sigma^2 s$ . The variance of the change in  $X$  between times  $s$  and  $t$  is

$$

E \left[ (X (t) - X (s)) ^ {2} \right] - \left(E [ X (t) - X (s) ]\right) ^ {2} = \sigma^ {2} (t - s)

$$

The variance per unit time is therefore constant and equal to  $\sigma^2$ . Because a Wiener process is Markov,  $X(t) - X(s)$  is uncorrelated with  $X(s)$ . Hence,

$$

\begin{array}{l} E [ X (s) X (t) ] = E [ X (s) (X (s) + X (t) - X (s)) ] \\ = E \left[ (X (s)) ^ {2} \right] + E [ X (s) (X (t) - X (s)) ] \\ = E \left[ (X (s)) ^ {2} \right] = \sigma^ {2} s \\ \end{array}

$$

In fractional Brownian motion we assume

$$

E \left[ \left(X (t) - X (s)\right) ^ {2} \right] = \sigma^ {2} (t - s) ^ {2 H}

$$ where  $H$  is referred to as the Hurst exponent. Continuing with the assumption that

$X(0) = 0$ ,  $E[(X(t)^2] = \sigma^2 t^{2H}$ , and  $E[(X(s)^2] = \sigma^2 s^{2H}$ . When  $H = 0.5$ , fractional Brownian motion becomes regular Brownian motion.

Since

$$
E \left[ (X (t) - X (s)) ^ {2} \right] = E \left[ (X (t)) ^ {2} \right] + E \left[ (X (s)) ^ {2} \right] - 2 E [ X (t) X (s) ]
$$ it follows that


$$

\begin{array}{l} E [ X (t) X (s) ] = 0. 5 \left\{E \left[ (X (t)) ^ {2} \right] + E \left[ (X (s)) ^ {2} \right] - E \left[ (X (t) - X (s)) ^ {2} \right] \right\} \\ = 0. 5 \sigma^ {2} \left[ t ^ {2 H} + s ^ {2 H} - (t - s) ^ {2 H} \right] \\ \end{array}

$$

When  $H = 0.5$ , this reduces to our earlier result for Wiener processes:  $E[X(s)X(t)] = \sigma^2 s$ . The correlation between  $X(t)$  and  $X(s)$  is

$$

\frac {0 . 5 \left[ t ^ {2 H} + s ^ {2 H} - (t - s) ^ {2 H} \right]}{s ^ {H} t ^ {H}} \tag {14.20}

$$

Fractional Brownian motion is non-Markov. If  $t > s > u$ , then

$$

\begin{array}{l} E \left[ \left(X (t) - X (s)\right) \left(X (s) - X (u)\right) \right] = E [ X (t) X (s) ] - E \left[ \left(X (s)\right) ^ {2} \right] \\ - E [ X (t) X (u) ] + E [ X (s) X (u) ] = 0. 5 \sigma^ {2} \left[ (t - u) ^ {2 H} - (t - s) ^ {2 H} - (s - u) ^ {2 H} \right] \\ \end{array}

$$

This is zero (as we expect) when  $H = 0.5$ . When  $H > 0.5$ , it is positive (so that the correlation between changes in  $X$  in successive periods of time is positive). When  $H < 0.5$ , it is negative (so that the correlation between changes in  $X$  in successive periods of time is negative).

Simulating fractional Brownian motion involves dividing the time period being considered into a number of small time steps of length  $\Delta t$ . A sample from a standard normal distribution,  $\epsilon$ , determines the change over one time step using equation (14.8). In regular Brownian motion the  $\epsilon$ 's used for different time steps are uncorrelated. In fractional Brownian motion we must build in the correlations so that equation (14.20) is satisfied. The  $\epsilon$  for the first step is chosen randomly; the  $\epsilon$  for the second step must be chosen so that  $X(2\Delta t)$  has the right correlation with  $X(\Delta t)$ ; the  $\epsilon$  for the third time step must be chosen so that  $X(3\Delta t)$  has the right correlation with both  $x(2\Delta t)$  and the  $X(\Delta t)$ ; and so on. The Cholesky decomposition procedure explained in Chapter 21, can be used to accomplish this.

Figure 14.3 shows the simulation of fractional Brownian motion over one year for values of  $H$  equal to 0.9, 0.5, and 0.1 when the time step is 0.01 years. As  $H$  decreases, the process becomes more noisy. This would become even more marked if we decreased the length of the time step further.

# SUMMARY

Stochastic processes describe the probabilistic evolution of the value of a variable through time. A Markov process is one where only the present value of the variable is relevant for predicting the future. The past history of the variable and the way in which the present has emerged from the past is irrelevant.

A Wiener process  $dz$  is a Markov process describing the evolution of a normally distributed variable. The drift of the process is zero and the variance rate is 1.0 per unit time. This means that, if the value of the variable is  $x_0$  at time 0, then at time  $T$  it is normally distributed with mean  $x_0$  and standard deviation  $\sqrt{T}$ .

A generalized Wiener process describes the evolution of a normally distributed variable with a drift of  $a$  per unit time and a variance rate of  $b^2$  per unit time, where  $a$  and  $b$  are constants. This means that if, as before, the value of the variable is  $x_0$  at time 0, it is normally distributed with a mean of  $x_0 + aT$  and a standard deviation of  $b\sqrt{T}$  at time  $T$ .

An Ito process is a process where the drift and variance rate of  $x$  can be a function of both  $x$  itself and time. The change in  $x$  in a very short period of time is, to a good approximation, normally distributed, but its change over longer periods of time is liable to be nonnormal.

One way of gaining an intuitive understanding of a stochastic process for a variable is to use Monte Carlo simulation. This involves dividing a time interval into many small time steps and randomly sampling possible paths for the variable. The future probability distribution for the variable can then be calculated. Monte Carlo simulation is discussed further in Chapter 21.

Ito's lemma is a way of calculating the stochastic process followed by a function of a variable from the stochastic process followed by the variable itself. As we shall see in Chapter 15, Ito's lemma plays a very important part in the pricing of derivatives. A key point is that the Wiener process  $dz$  underlying the stochastic process for the variable is exactly the same as the Wiener process underlying the stochastic process for the function of the variable. Both are subject to the same underlying source of uncertainty.

The stochastic process usually assumed for a stock price is geometric Brownian motion. Under this process the return to the holder of the stock in a small period of time is normally distributed and the returns in two nonoverlapping periods are independent. The value of the stock price at a future time has a lognormal distribution. The Black-Scholes-Merton model, which we cover in the next chapter, is based on the geometric Brownian motion assumption.

# APPENDIX

# A NONRIGOROUS DERIVATION OF ITO'S LEMMA

In this appendix, we show how Ito's lemma can be regarded as a natural extension of other, simpler results. Consider a continuous and differentiable function  $G$  of a variable  $x$ . If  $\Delta x$  is a small change in  $x$  and  $\Delta G$  is the resulting small change in  $G$ , a well-known result from ordinary calculus is

$$

\Delta G \approx \frac {d G}{d x} \Delta x \tag {14A.1}

$$

In other words,  $\Delta G$  is approximately equal to the rate of change of  $G$  with respect to  $x$  multiplied by  $\Delta x$ . The error involves terms of order  $\Delta x^2$ . If more precision is required, a Taylor series expansion of  $\Delta G$  can be used:

$$

\Delta G = \frac {d G}{d x} \Delta x + \frac {1}{2} \frac {d ^ {2} G}{d x ^ {2}} \Delta x ^ {2} + \frac {1}{6} \frac {d ^ {3} G}{d x ^ {3}} \Delta x ^ {3} + \dots

$$

For a continuous and differentiable function  $G$  of two variables  $x$  and  $y$ , the result analogous to equation (14A.1) is

$$

\Delta G \approx \frac {\partial G}{\partial x} \Delta x + \frac {\partial G}{\partial y} \Delta y \tag {14A.2}

$$ and the Taylor series expansion of  $\Delta G$  is

$$
\Delta G = \frac {\partial G}{\partial x} \Delta x + \frac {\partial G}{\partial y} \Delta y + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} G}{\partial x ^ {2}} \Delta x ^ {2} + \frac {\partial^ {2} G}{\partial x \partial y} \Delta x \Delta y + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} G}{\partial y ^ {2}} \Delta y ^ {2} + \dots \tag {14A.3}
$$

In the limit, as  $\Delta x$  and  $\Delta y$  tend to zero, equation (14A.3) becomes

$$ d G = \frac {\partial G}{\partial x} d x + \frac {\partial G}{\partial y} d y \tag {14A.4}
$$

We now extend equation (14A.4) to cover functions of variables following Itô processes. Suppose that a variable  $x$  follows the Itô process

$$ d x = a (x, t) d t + b (x, t) d z \tag {14A.5}
$$ and that  $G$  is some function of  $x$  and of time  $t$ . By analogy with equation (14A.3), we can write


$$

\Delta G = \frac {\partial G}{\partial x} \Delta x + \frac {\partial G}{\partial t} \Delta t + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} G}{\partial x ^ {2}} \Delta x ^ {2} + \frac {\partial^ {2} G}{\partial x \partial t} \Delta x \Delta t + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} G}{\partial t ^ {2}} \Delta t ^ {2} + \dots \tag {14A.6}

$$

Equation (14A.5) can be discretized to

$$

\Delta x = a (x, t) \Delta t + b (x, t) \epsilon \sqrt {\Delta t}

$$ or, if arguments are dropped,


$$

\Delta x = a \Delta t + b \epsilon \sqrt {\Delta t} \tag {14A.7}

$$

This equation reveals an important difference between the situation in equation (14A.6) and the situation in equation (14A.3). When limiting arguments were used to move from equation (14A.3) to equation (14A.4), terms in  $\Delta x^2$  were ignored because they were second-order terms. From equation (14A.7), we have

$$

\Delta x ^ {2} = b ^ {2} \epsilon^ {2} \Delta t + \text {t e r m s o f h i g h e r o r d e r i n} \Delta t \tag {14A.8}

$$

This shows that the term involving  $\Delta x^2$  in equation (14A.6) has a component that is of order  $\Delta t$  and cannot be ignored.

The variance of a standard normal distribution is 1.0. This means that

$$

E (\epsilon^ {2}) - [ E (\epsilon) ] ^ {2} = 1

$$ where  $E$  denotes expected value. Since  $E(\epsilon) = 0$ , it follows that  $E(\epsilon^2) = 1$ . The expected value of  $\epsilon^2\Delta t$ , therefore, is  $\Delta t$ . The variance of  $\epsilon^2\Delta t$  is, from the properties of the standard normal distribution,  $2\Delta t^2$ . We know that the variance of the change in a stochastic variable in time  $\Delta t$  is proportional to  $\Delta t$ , not  $\Delta t^2$ . The variance of  $\epsilon^2\Delta t$  is therefore too small for it to have a stochastic component. As a result, we can treat  $\epsilon^2\Delta t$  as nonstochastic and equal to its expected value,  $\Delta t$ , as  $\Delta t$  tends to zero. It follows from equation (14A.8) that  $\Delta x^2$  becomes nonstochastic and equal to  $b^2 dt$  as  $\Delta t$  tends to zero. Taking limits as  $\Delta x$  and  $\Delta t$  tend to zero in equation (14A.6), and using this last result, we obtain

$$ d G = \frac {\partial G}{\partial x} d x + \frac {\partial G}{\partial t} d t + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} G}{\partial x ^ {2}} b ^ {2} d t \tag {14A.9}
$$

This is Ito's lemma. If we substitute for  $dx$  from equation (14A.5), equation (14A.9) becomes

$$ d G = \left(\frac {\partial G}{\partial x} a + \frac {\partial G}{\partial t} + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} G}{\partial x ^ {2}} b ^ {2}\right) d t + \frac {\partial G}{\partial x} b d z.
$$

Technical Note 29 at www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~hull/TechnicalNotes provides proofs of extensions to Ito's lemma. When  $G$  is a function of variables  $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$  and

$$ d x _ {i} = a _ {i} d t + b _ {i} d z _ {i}
$$ we have


$$ d G = \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \frac {\partial G}{\partial x _ {1}} a _ {i} + \frac {\partial G}{\partial t} + \frac {1}{2} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \frac {\partial^ {2} G}{\partial x _ {i} \partial x _ {j}} b _ {i} b _ {j} \rho_ {i j}\right) d t + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \frac {\partial G}{\partial x _ {i}} b _ {i} d z _ {i} \tag {14A.10}
$$

Also, when  $G$  is a function of a variable  $x$  with several sources of uncertainty so that

$$ d x = a d t + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} b _ {i} d z _ {i}
$$ we have


$$ d G = \left(\frac {\partial G}{\partial x} a + \frac {\partial G}{\partial t} + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} G}{\partial x ^ {2}} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} b _ {i} b _ {j} \rho_ {i j}\right) d t + \frac {\partial G}{\partial x} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {m} b _ {i} d z _ {i} \tag {14A.11}
$$

In these equations,  $\rho_{ij}$  is the correlation between  $dz_{i}$  and  $dz_{j}$  (see Section 14.5).

# The Black-Scholes-Merton Model

In the early 1970s, Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton achieved a major breakthrough in the pricing of European stock options. This was the development of what has become known as the Black-Scholes-Merton (or Black-Scholes) model. The model has had a huge influence on the way that traders price and hedge derivatives. In 1997, the importance of the model was recognized when Robert Merton and Myron Scholes were awarded the Nobel prize for economics. Sadly, Fischer Black died in 1995; otherwise he too would undoubtedly have been one of the recipients of this prize.

How did Black, Scholes, and Merton make their breakthrough? Previous researchers had made similar assumptions and had correctly calculated the expected payoff from a European option. However, as explained in Section 13.2, it is difficult to know the correct discount rate to use for this payoff. Black and Scholes used the capital asset pricing model (see the appendix to Chapter 3) to determine a relationship between the market's required return on the option and the required return on the stock. This was not easy because the relationship depends on both the stock price and time. Merton's approach was different from that of Black and Scholes. It involved setting up a riskless portfolio consisting of the option and the underlying stock and arguing that the return on the portfolio over a short period of time must be the risk-free return. This is similar to what we did in Section 13.1—but more complicated because the portfolio changes continuously through time. Merton's approach was more general than that of Black and Scholes because it did not rely on the assumptions of the capital asset pricing model.

This chapter covers Merton's approach to deriving the Black-Scholes-Merton model. It explains how volatility can be either estimated from historical data or implied from option prices using the model. It shows how the risk-neutral valuation argument introduced in Chapter 13 can be used. It also shows how the Black-Scholes-Merton model can be extended to deal with European call and put options on dividend-paying stocks and presents some results on the pricing of American call options on dividend-paying stocks.

# 15.1 LOGNORMAL PROPERTY OF STOCK PRICES

The model of stock price behavior used by Black, Scholes, and Merton is the model we developed in Chapter 14. It assumes that percentage changes in the stock price in a very short period of time are normally distributed. Define

$\mu$ : Expected return in a short period of time (annualized)

$\sigma$  : Volatility of the stock price.

The mean and standard deviation of the return in time  $\Delta t$  are approximately  $\mu \Delta t$  and  $\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}$ , so that

$$
\frac {\Delta S}{S} \sim \phi (\mu \Delta t, \sigma^ {2} \Delta t) \tag {15.1}
$$ where  $\Delta S$  is the change in the stock price  $S$  in time  $\Delta t$ , and  $\phi(m, \nu)$  denotes a normal distribution with mean  $m$  and variance  $\nu$ . (This is equation (14.9).)


As shown in Section 14.7, the model implies that

$$

\ln S _ {T} - \ln S _ {0} \sim \phi \left[ \left(\mu - \frac {\sigma^ {2}}{2}\right) T, \sigma^ {2} T \right]

$$ so that


$$

\ln \frac {S _ {T}}{S _ {0}} \sim \phi \left[ \left(\mu - \frac {\sigma^ {2}}{2}\right) T, \sigma^ {2} T \right] \tag {15.2}

$$ and


$$

\ln S _ {T} \sim \phi \left[ \ln S _ {0} + \left(\mu - \frac {\sigma^ {2}}{2}\right) T, \sigma^ {2} T \right] \tag {15.3}

$$ where  $S_{T}$  is the stock price at a future time  $T$  and  $S_{0}$  is the stock price at time 0. There is no approximation here. The variable  $\ln S_{T}$  is normally distributed, so that  $S_{T}$  has a lognormal distribution. The mean of  $\ln S_{T}$  is  $\ln S_{0} + (\mu - \sigma^{2}/2)T$  and the standard deviation of  $\ln S_{T}$  is  $\sigma \sqrt{T}$ .

# Example 15.1

Consider a stock with an initial price of 40, an expected return of 16\% per annum, and a volatility of 20\% per annum. From equation (15.3), the probability distribution of the stock price S_{T} in 6 months' time is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l} \ln S _ {T} \sim \phi [ \ln 4 0 + (0. 1 6 - 0. 2 ^ {2} / 2) \times 0. 5, 0. 2 ^ {2} \times 0. 5 ] \\ \ln S _ {T} \sim \phi (3. 7 5 9, 0. 0 2) \\ \end{array}
$$

There is a  $95\%$  probability that a normally distributed variable has a value within 1.96 standard deviations of its mean. In this case, the standard deviation is  $\sqrt{0.02} = 0.141$ . Hence, with  $95\%$  confidence,

$$
3. 7 5 9 - 1. 9 6 \times 0. 1 4 1 <   \ln S _ {T} <   3. 7 5 9 + 1. 9 6 \times 0. 1 4 1
$$

This can be written  $b \pm  {2.5}$

$$ e ^ {3. 7 5 9 - 1. 9 6 \times 0. 1 4 1} <   S _ {T} <   e ^ {3. 7 5 9 + 1. 9 6 \times 0. 1 4 1}
$$ or


$$

3 2. 5 5 <   S _ {T} <   5 6. 5 6

$$

Thus, there is a  $95\%$  probability that the stock price in 6 months will lie between 32.55 and 56.56.

Figure 15.1 Lognormal distribution.

A variable that has a lognormal distribution can take any value between zero and infinity. Figure 15.1 illustrates the shape of a lognormal distribution. Unlike the normal distribution, it is skewed so that the mean, median, and mode are all different. From equation (15.3) and the properties of the lognormal distribution, it can be shown that the expected value  $E(S_T)$  of  $S_T$  is given by

$$

E \left(S _ {T}\right) = S _ {0} e ^ {\mu T} \tag {15.4}

$$

The variance  $\operatorname{var}(S_T)$  of  $S_{T}$ , can be shown to be given by

$$

\operatorname {v a r} \left(S _ {T}\right) = S _ {0} ^ {2} e ^ {2 \mu T} \left(e ^ {\sigma^ {2} T} - 1\right) \tag {15.5}

$$

# Example 15.2

Consider a stock where the current price is $20, the expected return is 20\% per annum, and the volatility is 40\% per annum. The expected stock price,  $E(S_{T})$ , and the variance of the stock price,  $\operatorname{var}(S_T)$ , in 1 year are given by

$$

E \left(S _ {T}\right) = 2 0 e ^ {0. 2 \times 1} = 2 4. 4 3 \quad \text {a n d} \quad \operatorname {v a r} \left(S _ {T}\right) = 4 0 0 e ^ {2 \times 0. 2 \times 1} \left(e ^ {0. 4 ^ {2} \times 1} - 1\right) = 1 0 3. 5 4

$$

The standard deviation of the stock price in 1 year is  $\sqrt{103.54}$ , or 10.18.

# 15.2 THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RATE OF RETURN

The lognormal property of stock prices can be used to provide information on the probability distribution of the continuously compounded rate of return earned on a stock between times 0 and  $T$ . If we define the continuously compounded rate of return per annum realized between times 0 and  $T$  as  $x$ , then

$$

S _ {T} = S _ {0} e ^ {x T}

$$ so that


$$ x = \frac {1}{T} \ln \frac {S _ {T}}{S _ {0}} \tag {15.6}
$$

From equation (15.2), it follows that

$$ x \sim \phi \left(\mu - \frac {\sigma^ {2}}{2}, \frac {\sigma^ {2}}{T}\right) \tag {15.7}
$$

Thus, the continuously compounded rate of return per annum is normally distributed with mean  $\mu - \sigma^2 / 2$  and standard deviation  $\sigma / \sqrt{T}$ . As  $T$  increases, the standard deviation of  $x$  declines. To understand the reason for this, consider two cases:  $T = 1$  and  $T = 20$ . We are more certain about the average return per year over 20 years than we are about the return in any one year.

# Example 15.3

Consider a stock with an expected return of  $17\%$  per annum and a volatility of  $20\%$  per annum. The probability distribution for the average rate of return (continuously compounded) realized over 3 years is normal, with mean

$$
0. 1 7 - \frac {0 . 2 ^ {2}}{2} = 0. 1 5
$$ or  $15\%$  per annum, and standard deviation


$$

\sqrt {\frac {0 . 2 ^ {2}}{3}} = 0. 1 1 5 5

$$ or  $11.55\%$  per annum. Because there is a  $95\%$  chance that a normally distributed variable will lie within 1.96 standard deviations of its mean, we can be  $95\%$  confident that the average continuously compounded return realized over 3 years will be between  $15 - 1.96 \times 11.55 = -7.6\%$  and  $15 + 1.96 \times 11.55 = +37.6\%$  per annum.

# 15.3 THE EXPECTED RETURN

The expected return,  $\mu$ , required by investors from a stock depends on the riskiness of the stock. The higher the risk, the higher the expected return. It also depends on the level of interest rates in the economy. The higher the level of interest rates, the higher the expected return required on any given stock. Fortunately, we do not have to concern ourselves with the determinants of  $\mu$  in any detail. It turns out that the value of a stock option, when expressed in terms of the value of the underlying stock, does not depend on  $\mu$  at all. Nevertheless, there is one aspect of the expected return from a stock that frequently causes confusion and needs to be explained.

Our model of stock price behavior implies that, in a very short period of time  $\Delta t$ , the mean return is  $\mu \Delta t$ . It is natural to assume from this that  $\mu$  is the expected continuously compounded return on the stock. However, this is not the case. The continuously compounded return,  $x$ , actually realized over a period of time of length  $T$ is given by equation (15.6) as

$$ x = \frac {1}{T} \ln \frac {S _ {T}}{S _ {0}}
$$ and, as indicated in equation (15.7), the expected value  $E(x)$  of  $x$  is  $\mu - \sigma^2 / 2$ .


The reason why the expected continuously compounded return is different from  $\mu$  is subtle, but important. Suppose we consider a very large number of very short periods of time of length  $\Delta t$ . Define  $S_{i}$  as the stock price at the end of the  $i$ th interval and  $\Delta S_{i}$  as  $S_{i+1} - S_{i}$ . Under the assumptions we are making for stock price behavior, the arithmetic average of the returns on the stock in each interval is close to  $\mu$ . In other words,  $\mu \Delta t$  is close to the arithmetic mean of the  $\Delta S_{i} / S_{i}$ . However, the expected return over the whole period covered by the data, expressed with a compounding interval of  $\Delta t$ , is a geometric average and is close to  $\mu - \sigma^{2} / 2$ , not  $\mu$ . Business Snapshot 15.1 provides a numerical example concerning the mutual fund industry to illustrate why this is so.

For another explanation of what is going on, we start with equation (15.4):

$$

E (S _ {T}) = S _ {0} e ^ {\mu T}

$$

Taking logarithms, we get

$$

\ln \left[ E \left(S _ {T}\right) \right] = \ln \left(S _ {0}\right) + \mu T

$$

It is now tempting to set  $\ln [E(S_T)] = E[\ln (S_T)]$ , so that  $E[\ln (S_T)] - \ln (S_0) = \mu T$ , or  $E[\ln (S_T / S_0)] = \mu T$ , which leads to  $E(x) = \mu$ . However, we cannot do this because  $\ln$  is a nonlinear function. In fact,  $\ln [E(S_T)] > E[\ln (S_T)]$ , so that  $E[\ln (S_T / S_0)] < \mu T$ , which leads to  $E(x) < \mu$ . (As shown above,  $E(x) = \mu - \sigma^2 / 2$ .)

# 15.4 VOLATILITY

The volatility,  $\sigma$ , of a stock is a measure of our uncertainty about the returns provided by the stock. Stocks typically have a volatility between  $15\%$  and  $60\%$ .

From equation (15.7), the volatility of a stock price can be defined as the standard deviation of the return provided by the stock in 1 year when the return is expressed using continuous compounding.

When  $\Delta t$  is small, equation (15.1) shows that  $\sigma^2\Delta t$  is approximately equal to the variance of the percentage change in the stock price in time  $\Delta t$ . This means that  $\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}$  is approximately equal to the standard deviation of the percentage change in the stock price in time  $\Delta t$ . Suppose that  $\sigma = 0.3$ , or  $30\%$ , per annum and the current stock price is 50. The standard deviation of the percentage change in the stock price in 1 week is approximately

$$

30 \times \sqrt {\frac {1}{52}} = 4.16 \%

$$

A 1-standard-deviation move in the stock price in 1 week is therefore  $50 \times 0.0416 = 2.08$ .

Uncertainty about a future stock price, as measured by its standard deviation, increases—at least approximately—with the square root of how far ahead we are looking. For example, the standard deviation of the stock price in 4 weeks is approximately twice the standard deviation in 1 week.

# Business Snapshot 15.1 Mutual Fund Returns Can Be Misleading

The difference between  $\mu$  and  $\mu - \sigma^2 / 2$  is closely related to an issue in the reporting of mutual fund returns. Suppose that the following is a sequence of returns per annum reported by a mutual fund manager over the last five years (measured using annual compounding):  $15\%$ ,  $20\%$ ,  $30\%$ ,  $-20\%$ ,  $25\%$ .

The arithmetic mean of the returns, calculated by taking the sum of the returns and dividing by 5, is  $14\%$ . However, an investor would actually earn less than  $14\%$  per annum by leaving the money invested in the fund for 5 years. The dollar value of 100 at the end of the 5 years would be

$$

1 0 0 \times 1. 1 5 \times 1. 2 0 \times 1. 3 0 \times 0. 8 0 \times 1. 2 5 = \$ 1 7 9. 4 0

$$

By contrast, a  $14\%$  return with annual compounding would give

$$

1 0 0 \times 1. 1 4 ^ {5} = \$ 1 9 2. 5 4

$$

The return that gives 179.40 at the end of five years is 12.4\%. This is because

$$

1 0 0 \times (1. 1 2 4) ^ {5} = 1 7 9. 4 0

$$

What average return should the fund manager report? It is tempting for the manager to make a statement such as: "The average of the returns per year that we have realized in the last 5 years is  $14\%$ ." Although true, this is misleading. It is much less misleading to say: "The average return realized by someone who invested with us for the last 5 years is  $12.4\%$  per year." In some jurisdictions, regulations require fund managers to report returns the second way.

This phenomenon is an example of a result that is well known in mathematics. The geometric mean of a set of numbers is always less than the arithmetic mean. In our example, the return multipliers each year are 1.15, 1.20, 1.30, 0.80, and 1.25. The arithmetic mean of these numbers is 1.140, but the geometric mean is only 1.124 and it is the geometric mean that equals 1 plus the return realized over the 5 years.

# Estimating Volatility from Historical Data

To estimate the volatility of a stock price empirically, the stock price is usually observed at fixed intervals of time (e.g., every day, week, or month). Define:

$n + 1$ : Number of observations

$S_{i}$  : Stock price at end of ith interval, with  $i = 0,1,\dots ,n$

$\tau$  : Length of time interval in years and let


$$ u _ {i} = \ln \left(\frac {S _ {i}}{S _ {i - 1}}\right) \quad \text {f o r} i = 1, 2, \dots , n
$$

The usual estimate,  $s$ , of the standard deviation of the  $u_{i}$  is given by

$$ s = \sqrt {\frac {1}{n - 1} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \left(u _ {i} - \bar {u}\right) ^ {2}}
$$ or


$$ s = \sqrt {\frac {1}{n - 1} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} u _ {i} ^ {2} - \frac {1}{n (n - 1)} \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} u _ {i}\right) ^ {2}}
$$ where  $\overline{u}$  is the mean of the  $u_{i}$ .


From equation (15.2), the standard deviation of the  $u_{i}$  is  $\sigma \sqrt{\tau}$ . The variable  $s$  is therefore an estimate of  $\sigma \sqrt{\tau}$ . It follows that  $\sigma$  itself can be estimated as  $\hat{\sigma}$ , where

$$

\hat {\sigma} = \frac {s}{\sqrt {\tau}}

$$

The standard error of this estimate can be shown to be approximately  $\hat{\sigma} / \sqrt{2n}$ .

The prices of actively traded options are not usually calculated from volatilities based on historical data. As we shall see later in this chapter, implied volatilities are used by traders. However, estimates of volatility based on historical data are used extensively in risk management. Usually risk managers set  $\tau$  equal to one day. A problem that risk managers have to deal with is that volatilities tend to change through time. There are periods of high volatility and periods of low volatility. This affects the amount of data used to estimate volatility (i.e., the choice of  $n$ ). If volatilities were constant, the accuracy of an estimate would increase as  $n$  increased. However, data that is too old may not be relevant to current market conditions. A compromise that seems to work reasonably well is to use 90 to 180 days of data. An alternative rule of thumb is to set  $n$  equal to the number of days to which the volatility is to be applied. If the estimate is to be applied over a two-year future period, two years of historical data would then be used. It is natural to look for a way of giving more weight to recent daily price movements (i.e., values of  $u_{i}$  for recent time periods). An approach known as GARCH, which will be discussed in Chapter 23 does this.

# Example 15.4

Table 15.1 shows a possible sequence of stock prices during 21 consecutive trading days. In this case,  $n = 20$ , so that

$$

\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} u _ {i} = 0. 0 9 5 3 1 \quad \text {a n d} \quad \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} u _ {i} ^ {2} = 0. 0 0 3 2 6

$$ and the estimate of the standard deviation of the daily return is


$$

\sqrt {\frac {0 . 0 0 3 2 6}{1 9} - \frac {0 . 0 9 5 3 1 ^ {2}}{2 0 \times 1 9}} = 0. 0 1 2 1 6

$$ or  $1.216\%$ . Assuming that there are 252 trading days per year,  $\tau = 1 / 252$  and the data give an estimate for the volatility per annum of  $0.01216\sqrt{252} = 0.193$ , or  $19.3\%$ . The standard error of this estimate is

$$
\frac {0 . 1 9 3}{\sqrt {2 \times 2 0}} = 0. 0 3 1
$$ or  $3.1\%$  per annum.

The foregoing analysis assumes that the stock pays no dividends, but it can be adapted to accommodate dividend-paying stocks. The return,  $u_{i}$ , during a time interval that includes an ex-dividend day is given by

$$ u _ {i} = \ln \frac {S _ {i} + D}{S _ {i - 1}}
$$ where  $D$  is the amount of the dividend. The return in other time intervals is still


$$ u _ {i} = \ln \frac {S _ {i}}{S _ {i - 1}}
$$

However, as tax factors play a part in determining returns around an ex-dividend date, it is probably best to discard altogether data for intervals that include an ex-dividend date.

# Trading Days vs. Calendar Days

An important issue is whether time should be measured in calendar days or trading days when volatility parameters are being estimated and used. As shown in Business Snapshot 15.2, research shows that volatility is much higher when the exchange is open for trading than when it is closed. As a result, practitioners tend to ignore days when the exchange is closed when estimating volatility from historical data and when calculating the life of an option. The volatility per annum is calculated from the volatility per

# Business Snapshot 15.2 What Causes Volatility?

It is natural to assume that the volatility of a stock is caused by new information reaching the market. This new information causes people to revise their opinions about the value of the stock. The price of the stock changes and volatility results. This view of what causes volatility is not supported by research. With several years of daily stock price data, researchers can calculate:

1. The variance of stock price returns between the close of trading on one day and the close of trading on the next day when there are no intervening nontrading days
2. The variance of the stock price returns between the close of trading on Friday and the close of trading on Monday

The second of these is the variance of returns over a 3-day period. The first is a variance over a 1-day period. We might reasonably expect the second variance to be three times as great as the first variance. Fama (1965), French (1980), and French and Roll (1986) show that this is not the case. These three research studies estimate the second variance to be, respectively,  $22\%$ ,  $19\%$ , and  $10.7\%$  higher than the first variance.

At this stage one might be tempted to argue that these results are explained by more news reaching the market when the market is open for trading. But research by Roll (1984) does not support this explanation. Roll looked at the prices of orange juice futures. By far the most important news for orange juice futures prices is news about the weather and this is equally likely to arrive at any time. When Roll did a similar analysis to that just described for stocks, he found that the second (Friday-to-Monday) variance for orange juice futures is only 1.54 times the first variance.

The only reasonable conclusion from all this is that volatility is to a large extent caused by trading itself. (Traders usually have no difficulty accepting this conclusion!) trading day using the formula

$$
\frac {\text {V o l a t i l i t y}}{\text {p e r a n n u m}} = \frac {\text {V o l a t i l i t y}}{\text {p e r t r a d i n g d a y}} \times \sqrt {\frac {\text {N u m b e r o f t r a d i n g d a y s}}{\text {p e r a n n u m}}}
$$

This is what we did in Example 15.4 when calculating volatility from the data in Table 15.1. The number of trading days in a year is usually assumed to be 252 for stocks.

The life of an option is also usually measured using trading days rather than calendar days. It is calculated as  $T$  years, where

$$
T = \frac {\text {N u m b e r o f t r a d i n g d a y s u n t i l o p t i o n m a t u r i t y}}{2 5 2}
$$

# 15.5 THE IDEA UNDERLYING THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION

The Black-Scholes-Merton differential equation is an equation that must be satisfied by the price of any derivative dependent on a non-dividend-paying stock. The equation is derived in the next section. Here we consider the nature of the arguments we will use.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/93276fa839e4013a56ec3a88801c351d20f6e63459f16963c6a1e01eaf691e4e.jpg)

Figure 15.2 Relationship between call price and stock price. Current stock price is  $S_0$ .

These are similar to the no-arbitrage arguments we used to value stock options in Chapter 13 for the situation where stock price movements were assumed to be binomial. They involve setting up a riskless portfolio consisting of a position in the derivative and a position in the stock. In the absence of arbitrage opportunities, the return from the portfolio must be the risk-free interest rate,  $r$ . This leads to the Black-Scholes-Merton differential equation.

The reason a riskless portfolio can be set up is that the stock price and the derivative price are both affected by the same underlying source of uncertainty: stock price movements. In any short period of time, the price of the derivative is perfectly correlated with the price of the underlying stock. When an appropriate portfolio of the stock and the derivative is established, the gain or loss from the stock position always offsets the gain or loss from the derivative position so that the overall value of the portfolio at the end of the short period of time is known with certainty.

Suppose, for example, that at a particular point in time the relationship between a small change  $\Delta S$  in the stock price and the resultant small change  $\Delta c$  in the price of a European call option is given by

$$
\Delta c = 0. 4 \Delta S
$$

This means that the slope of the line representing the relationship between  $c$  and  $S$  is 0.4, as indicated in Figure 15.2. A riskless portfolio would consist of:

1. A long position in 40 shares
2. A short position in 100 call options.

Suppose, for example, that the stock price increases by 10 cents. The option price will increase by 4 cents and the 4 \times 0.1 = \ 4$ gain on the shares is equal to the 100 \times 0.04 = \ 4 loss on the short option position.

There is one important difference between the Black-Scholes-Merton analysis and our analysis using a binomial model in Chapter 13. In Black-Scholes-Merton, the position in the stock and the derivative is riskless for only a very short period of time. (Theoretically, it remains riskless only for an instantaneously short period of time.) To remain riskless, it must be adjusted, or rebalanced, frequently. For example, the relationship between  $\Delta c$  and  $\Delta S$  in our example might change from  $\Delta c = 0.4\Delta S$  today to  $\Delta c = 0.5\Delta S$  tomorrow. This would mean that, in order to maintain the riskless position, an extra 10 shares would have to be purchased for each 100 call options sold. It is nevertheless true that the return from the riskless portfolio in any very short period of time must be the risk-free interest rate. This is the key element in the Black-Scholes-Merton analysis and leads to their pricing formulas.

# Assumptions

The assumptions we use to derive the Black-Scholes-Merton differential equation are as follows:

1. The stock price follows the process developed in Chapter 14 with  $\mu$  and  $\sigma$  constant.
2. The short selling of securities with full use of proceeds is permitted.
3. There are no transaction costs or taxes. All securities are perfectly divisible.
4. There are no dividends during the life of the derivative.
5. There are no riskless arbitrage opportunities.
6. Security trading is continuous.
7. The risk-free rate of interest,  $r$ , is constant and the same for all maturities.

As we discuss in later chapters, some of these assumptions can be relaxed. For example,  $\sigma$  and  $r$  can be known functions of  $t$ . We can even allow interest rates to be stochastic provided that the stock price distribution at maturity of the option is still lognormal.

# 15.6 DERIVATION OF THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION

In this section, the notation is different from elsewhere in the book. We consider a derivative's price at a general time  $t$  (not at time zero). If  $T$  is the maturity date, the time to maturity is  $T - t$ .

The stock price process we are assuming is the one we developed in Section 14.3:

$$ d S = \mu S d t + \sigma S d z \tag {15.8}
$$

Suppose that  $f$  is the price of a call option or other derivative contingent on  $S$ . The variable  $f$  must be some function of  $S$  and  $t$ . Hence, from equation (14.14),

$$ d f = \left(\frac {\partial f}{\partial S} \mu S + \frac {\partial f}{\partial t} + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} f}{\partial S ^ {2}} \sigma^ {2} S ^ {2}\right) d t + \frac {\partial f}{\partial S} \sigma S d z \tag {15.9}
$$

The discrete versions of equations (15.8) and (15.9) are

$$
\Delta S = \mu S \Delta t + \sigma S \Delta z \tag {15.10}
$$ and


$$

\Delta f = \left(\frac {\partial f}{\partial S} \mu S + \frac {\partial f}{\partial t} + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} f}{\partial S ^ {2}} \sigma^ {2} S ^ {2}\right) \Delta t + \frac {\partial f}{\partial S} \sigma S \Delta z \tag {15.11}

$$ where  $\Delta f$  and  $\Delta S$  are the changes in  $f$  and  $S$  in a small time interval  $\Delta t$ . Recall from

the discussion of Ito's lemma in Section 14.6 that the Wiener processes underlying  $f$  and  $S$  are the same. In other words, the  $\Delta z(= \epsilon \sqrt{\Delta t})$  in equations (15.10) and (15.11) are the same. It follows that a portfolio of the stock and the derivative can be constructed so that the Wiener process is eliminated. The portfolio is

-1: derivative
+∂f/∂S: shares.

The holder of this portfolio is short one derivative and long an amount  $\partial f / \partial S$  of shares. Define  $\Pi$  as the value of the portfolio. By definition

$$
\Pi = - f + \frac {\partial f}{\partial S} S \tag {15.12}
$$

The change  $\Delta \Pi$  in the value of the portfolio in the time interval  $\Delta t$  is given by

$$
\Delta \Pi = - \Delta f + \frac {\partial f}{\partial S} \Delta S \tag {15.13}
$$

Substituting equations (15.10) and (15.11) into equation (15.13) yields

$$
\Delta \Pi = \left(- \frac {\partial f}{\partial t} - \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} f}{\partial S ^ {2}} \sigma^ {2} S ^ {2}\right) \Delta t \tag {15.14}
$$

Because this equation does not involve  $\Delta z$ , the portfolio must be riskless during time  $\Delta t$ . The assumptions listed in the preceding section imply that the portfolio must instantaneously earn the same rate of return as other short-term risk-free securities. If it earned more than this return, arbitrageurs could make a riskless profit by borrowing money to buy the portfolio; if it earned less, they could make a riskless profit by shorting the portfolio and buying risk-free securities. It follows that

$$
\Delta \Pi = r \Pi \Delta t \tag {15.15}
$$ where  $r$  is the risk-free interest rate. Substituting from equations (15.12) and (15.14) into (15.15), we obtain


$$

\left(\frac {\partial f}{\partial t} + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} f}{\partial S ^ {2}} \sigma^ {2} S ^ {2}\right) \Delta t = r \left(f - \frac {\partial f}{\partial S} S\right) \Delta t

$$ so that


$$

\frac {\partial f}{\partial t} + r S \frac {\partial f}{\partial S} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {2} S ^ {2} \frac {\partial^ {2} f}{\partial S ^ {2}} = r f \tag {15.16}

$$

Equation (15.16) is the Black-Scholes-Merton differential equation. It has many solutions, corresponding to all the different derivatives that can be defined with  $S$  as the underlying variable. The particular derivative that is obtained when the equation is solved depends on the boundary conditions that are used. These specify the values of the derivative at the boundaries of possible values of  $S$  and  $t$ . In the case of a European call option, the key boundary condition is

$$ f = \max  (S - K, 0) \quad \text {w h e n} t = T
$$

In the case of a European put option, it is

$$ f = \max  (K - S, 0) \quad \text {w h e n} t = T
$$

# Example 15.5

A forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock is a derivative dependent on the stock. As such, it should satisfy equation (15.16). From equation (5.5), we know that the value of the forward contract,  $f$ , at a general time  $t$  is given in terms of the stock price  $S$  at this time by

$$ f = S - K e ^ {- r (T - t)}
$$ where  $K$  is the delivery price. This means that


$$

\frac {\partial f}{\partial t} = - r K e ^ {- r (T - t)}, \quad \frac {\partial f}{\partial S} = 1, \quad \frac {\partial^ {2} f}{\partial S ^ {2}} = 0

$$

When these are substituted into the left-hand side of equation (15.16), we obtain

$$
- r K e ^ {- r (T - t)} + r S
$$

This equals  $rf$ , showing that equation (15.16) is indeed satisfied.

# A Perpetual Derivative

Consider a perpetual derivative that pays off a fixed amount  $Q$  when the stock price equals  $H$  for the first time. In this case, the value of the derivative for a particular  $S$  has no dependence on  $t$ , so the  $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$  term vanishes and the partial differential equation (15.16) becomes an ordinary differential equation.

Suppose first that  $S < H$ . The boundary conditions for the derivative are  $f = 0$  when  $S = 0$  and  $f = Q$  when  $S = H$ . The simple solution  $f = QS / H$  satisfies both the boundary conditions and the differential equation. It must therefore be the value of the derivative.

Suppose next that  $S > H$ . The boundary conditions are now  $f = 0$  as  $S$  tends to infinity and  $f = Q$  when  $S = H$ . The derivative price

$$ f = Q \left(\frac {S}{H}\right) ^ {- \alpha}
$$ where  $\alpha$  is positive, satisfies the boundary conditions. It also satisfies the differential equation when


$$
- r \alpha + \frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {2} \alpha (\alpha + 1) - r = 0
$$ or  $\alpha = 2r / \sigma^2$ . The value of the derivative is therefore

$$ f = Q \left(\frac {S}{H}\right) ^ {- 2 r / \sigma^ {2}} \tag {15.17}
$$

Problem 15.31 shows how equation (15.17) can be used to price a perpetual American put option. Section 26.2 extends the analysis to show how perpetual American call and put options can be priced when the underlying asset provides a yield at rate  $q$ .

# The Prices of Tradeable Derivatives

Any function  $f(S, t)$  that is a solution of the differential equation (15.16) is the theoretical price of a derivative that could be traded. If a derivative with that price existed, it would not create any arbitrage opportunities. Conversely, if a function  $f(S, t)$  does not satisfy the differential equation (15.16), it cannot be the price of a derivative without creating arbitrage opportunities for traders.

To illustrate this point, consider first the function  $e^S$ . This does not satisfy the differential equation (15.16). It is therefore not a candidate for being the price of a derivative dependent on the stock price. If an instrument whose price was always  $e^S$  existed, there would be an arbitrage opportunity. As a second example, consider the function  $e^{(\sigma^2 - 2r)(T - t)} / S$ . This does satisfy the differential equation, and so is, in theory, the price of a tradeable security. (It is the price of a derivative that pays off  $1 / S_T$  at time  $T$ .) For other examples of tradeable derivatives, see Problems 15.19, 15.20, and 15.31.

# 15.7 RISK-NEUTRAL VALUATION

We introduced risk-neutral valuation in connection with the binomial model in Chapter 13. It is without doubt the single most important tool for the analysis of derivatives. It arises from one key property of the Black-Scholes-Merton differential equation (15.16). This property is that the equation does not involve any variables that are affected by the risk preferences of investors. The variables that do appear in the equation are the current stock price, time, stock price volatility, and the risk-free rate of interest. All are independent of risk preferences.

The Black-Scholes-Merton differential equation would not be independent of risk preferences if it involved the expected return,  $\mu$ , on the stock. This is because the value of  $\mu$  does depend on risk preferences. The higher the level of risk aversion by investors, the higher  $\mu$  will be for any given stock. It is fortunate that  $\mu$  happens to drop out in the derivation of the differential equation.

Because the Black-Scholes-Merton differential equation is independent of risk preferences, an ingenious argument can be used. If risk preferences do not enter the equation, they cannot affect its solution. Any set of risk preferences can, therefore, be used when evaluating  $f$ . In particular, the very simple assumption that all investors are risk neutral can be made.

In a world where investors are risk neutral, the expected return on all investment assets is the risk-free rate of interest,  $r$ . The reason is that risk-neutral investors do not require a premium to induce them to take risks. It is also true that the present value of any cash flow in a risk-neutral world can be obtained by discounting its expected value at the risk-free rate. The assumption that the world is risk neutral does, therefore, considerably simplify the analysis of derivatives.

Consider a derivative that provides a payoff at one particular time. It can be valued using risk-neutral valuation by using the following procedure:

1. Assume that the expected return from the underlying asset is the risk-free interest rate  $r$  (i.e., assume  $u_{r} = r$ ).
2. Calculate the expected payoff from the derivative.
3. Discount the expected payoff at the risk-free interest rate.

It is important to appreciate that risk-neutral valuation (or the assumption that all investors are risk neutral) is merely an artificial device for obtaining solutions to the Black-Scholes-Merton differential equation. The solutions that are obtained are valid in all worlds, not just those where investors are risk neutral. When we move from a risk-neutral world to a risk-averse world, two things happen. The expected payoff from the derivative changes and the discount rate that must be used for this payoff changes. It happens that these two changes always offset each other exactly.

# Application to Forward Contracts on a Stock

We valued forward contracts on a non-dividend-paying stock in Section 5.7. In Example 15.5, we verified that the pricing formula satisfies the Black-Scholes-Merton differential equation. In this section we derive the pricing formula from risk-neutral valuation. We make the assumption that interest rates are constant and equal to  $r$ . This is somewhat more restrictive than the assumption in Chapter 5.

Consider a long forward contract that matures at time  $T$  with delivery price,  $K$ . As indicated in Figure 1.2, the value of the contract at maturity is

$$
S _ {T} - K
$$ where  $S_{T}$  is the stock price at time  $T$ . From the risk-neutral valuation argument, the value of the forward contract at time 0 is its expected value at time  $T$  in a risk-neutral world discounted at the risk-free rate of interest. Denoting the value of the forward contract at time zero by  $f$ , this means that


$$ f = e ^ {- r T} \hat {E} (S _ {T} - K)
$$ where  $\hat{E}$  denotes the expected value in a risk-neutral world. Since  $K$  is a constant, this equation becomes


$$ f = e ^ {- r T} \hat {E} \left(S _ {T}\right) - K e ^ {- r T} \tag {15.18}
$$

The expected return  $\mu$  on the stock becomes  $r$  in a risk-neutral world. Hence, from equation (15.4), we have

$$
\hat {E} \left(S _ {T}\right) = S _ {0} e ^ {r T} \tag {15.19}
$$

Substituting equation (15.19) into equation (15.18) gives

$$ f = S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T}
$$

This is in agreement with equation (5.5).

# 15.8 BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON PRICING FORMULAS

The most famous solutions to the differential equation (15.16) are the Black-Scholes-Merton formulas for the prices of European call and put options. These formulas are:

$$ c = S _ {0} N \left(d _ {1}\right) - K e ^ {- r T} N \left(d _ {2}\right) \tag {15.20}
$$ and


$$ p = K e ^ {- r T} N \left(- d _ {2}\right) - S _ {0} N \left(- d _ {1}\right) \tag {15.21}
$$ where

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e4a3c432-f970-46aa-92e4-7e5c2a06d8f6/35f4442393050fd8594b9f4cd673758fb53a98c5156c14b4afb88addd9bb50bf.jpg)
Figure 15.3 Shaded area represents  $N(x)$ .


$$

\begin{array}{l} d _ {1} = \frac {\ln \left(S _ {0} / K\right) + (r + \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}} \\ d _ {2} = \frac {\ln \left(S _ {0} / K\right) + (r - \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}} = d _ {1} - \sigma \sqrt {T} \\ \end{array}

$$

The function  $N(x)$  is the cumulative probability distribution function for a variable with a standard normal distribution. In other words, it is the probability that a variable with a standard normal distribution will be less than  $x$ . It is illustrated in Figure 15.3. The remaining variables should be familiar. The variables  $c$  and  $p$  are the European call and European put price,  $S_0$  is the stock price at time zero,  $K$  is the strike price,  $r$  is the continuously compounded risk-free rate,  $\sigma$  is the stock price volatility, and  $T$  is the time to maturity of the option.

One way of deriving the Black-Scholes-Merton formulas is by solving the differential equation (15.16) subject to the boundary condition mentioned in Section 15.6. (See Problem 15.25 to prove that the call price in equation (15.20) satisfies the differential equation.) Another approach is to use risk-neutral valuation. Consider a European call option. The expected value of the option at maturity in a risk-neutral world is

$$

\hat {E} [ \max  (S _ {T} - K, 0) ]

$$ where, as before,  $\hat{E}$  denotes the expected value in a risk-neutral world. From the risk-neutral valuation argument, the European call option price  $c$  is this expected value discounted at the risk-free rate of interest, that is,

$$ c = e ^ {- r T} \hat {E} [ \max  (S _ {T} - K, 0) ] \tag {15.22}
$$

The appendix at the end of this chapter shows that this equation leads to the result in equation (15.20).

Since it is never optimal to exercise early an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock (see Section 11.5), equation (15.20) is the value of an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock. Unfortunately, no exact analytic formula for the value of an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock has been produced. Numerical procedures for calculating American put values are discussed in Chapter 21.

When the Black-Scholes-Merton formula is used in practice the interest rate  $r$  is set equal to the zero-coupon risk-free interest rate for a maturity  $T$ . As we show in later chapters, this is theoretically correct when  $r$  is a known function of time. It is also theoretically correct when the interest rate is stochastic provided that the stock price at time  $T$  is lognormal and the volatility parameter is chosen appropriately. As mentioned earlier, time is normally measured as the number of trading days left in the life of the option divided by the number of trading days in 1 year.

# Understanding  $N(d_{1})$  and  $N(d_{2})$

The term  $N(d_{2})$  in equation (15.20) has a fairly simple interpretation. It is the probability that a call option will be exercised in a risk-neutral world. The  $N(d_{1})$  term is not quite so easy to interpret. The expression  $S_{0}N(d_{1})e^{rT}$  is the expected stock price at time  $T$  in a risk-neutral world when stock prices less than the strike price are counted as zero. The strike price is only paid if the stock price is greater than  $K$  and as just mentioned this has a probability of  $N(d_{2})$ . The expected payoff in a risk-neutral world is therefore

$$
S _ {0} N (d _ {1}) e ^ {r T} - K N (d _ {2})
$$

Present-valuing this from time  $T$  to time zero gives the Black-Scholes-Merton equation for a European call option:

$$ c = S _ {0} N \left(d _ {1}\right) - K e ^ {- r T} N \left(d _ {2}\right)
$$

For another way of looking at the Black-Scholes-Merton equation for the value of a European call option, note that it can be written as

$$ c = e ^ {- r T} N \left(d _ {2}\right) \left[ S _ {0} e ^ {r T} N \left(d _ {1}\right) / N \left(d _ {2}\right) - K \right]
$$

The terms here have the following interpretation:

$e^{-rT}$ : Present value factor

$N(d_{2})$  : Probability of exercise

$S_0e^{rT}N(d_1) / N(d_2)$  Expected stock price in a risk-neutral world if option is exercised

$K$ : Strike price paid if option is exercised.

# Properties of the Black-Scholes-Merton Formulas

We now show that the Black-Scholes-Merton formulas have the right general properties by considering what happens when some of the parameters take extreme values.

When the stock price,  $S_0$ , becomes very large, a call option is almost certain to be exercised. It then becomes very similar to a forward contract with delivery price  $K$ .

From equation (5.5), we expect the call price to be

$$
S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T}
$$

This is, in fact, the call price given by equation (15.20) because, when  $S_0$  becomes very large, both  $d_1$  and  $d_2$  become very large, and  $N(d_1)$  and  $N(d_2)$  become close to 1.0. When the stock price becomes very large, the price of a European put option,  $p$ , approaches zero. This is consistent with equation (15.21) because  $N(-d_1)$  and  $N(-d_2)$  are both close to zero in this case.

Consider next what happens when the volatility  $\sigma$  approaches zero. Because the stock is virtually riskless, its price will grow at rate  $r$  to  $S_0e^{rT}$  at time  $T$  and the payoff from a call option is

$$
\max  (S _ {0} e ^ {r T} - K, 0)
$$

Discounting at rate  $r$ , the value of the call today is

$$ e ^ {- r T} \max  \left(S _ {0} e ^ {r T} - K, 0\right) = \max  \left(S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T}, 0\right)
$$

To show that this is consistent with equation (15.20), consider first the case where  $S_0 > Ke^{-rT}$ . This implies that  $\ln(S_0 / K) + rT > 0$ . As  $\sigma$  tends to zero,  $d_1$  and  $d_2$  tend to  $+\infty$ , so that  $N(d_1)$  and  $N(d_2)$  tend to 1.0 and equation (15.20) becomes

$$ c = S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T}
$$

When  $S_0 < Ke^{-rT}$ , it follows that  $\ln(S_0 / K) + rT < 0$ . As  $\sigma$  tends to zero,  $d_1$  and  $d_2$  tend to  $-\infty$ , so that  $N(d_1)$  and  $N(d_2)$  tend to zero and equation (15.20) gives a call price of zero. The call price is therefore always  $\max(S_0 - Ke^{-rT}, 0)$  as  $\sigma$  tends to zero. Similarly, it can be shown that the put price is always  $\max(Ke^{-rT} - S_0, 0)$  as  $\sigma$  tends to zero.

# 15.9 CUMULATIVE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION

When implementing equations (15.20) and (15.21), it is necessary to evaluate the cumulative normal distribution function  $N(x)$ . Tables for  $N(x)$  are provided at the end of this book. The NORMSDIST function in Excel also provides a convenient way of calculating  $N(x)$ .

# Example 15.6

The stock price 6 months from the expiration of an option is  $42, the exercise price of the option is$ 40, the risk-free interest rate is 10\% per annum, and the volatility is 20\% per annum. This means that  $S_0 = 42$ ,  $K = 40$ ,  $r = 0.1$ ,  $\sigma = 0.2$ ,  $T = 0.5$ ,

$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (4 2 / 4 0) + (0 . 1 + 0 . 2 ^ {2} / 2) \times 0 . 5}{0 . 2 \sqrt {0 . 5}} = 0. 7 6 9 3
$$

$$ d _ {2} = \frac {\ln (4 2 / 4 0) + (0 . 1 - 0 . 2 ^ {2} / 2) \times 0 . 5}{0 . 2 \sqrt {0 . 5}} = 0. 6 2 7 8
$$ and


$$

K e ^ {- r T} = 4 0 e ^ {- 0. 0 5} = 3 8. 0 4 9

$$

Hence, if the option is a European call, its value  $c$  is given by

$$ c = 4 2 N (0. 7 6 9 3) - 3 8. 0 4 9 N (0. 6 2 7 8)
$$

If the option is a European put, its value  $p$  is given by

$$ p = 3 8. 0 4 9 N (- 0. 6 2 7 8) - 4 2 N (- 0. 7 6 9 3)
$$

Using the NORMSDIST function in Excel gives

$$
N (0. 7 6 9 3) = 0. 7 7 9 1, \quad N (- 0. 7 6 9 3) = 0. 2 2 0 9
$$

$$
N (0. 6 2 7 8) = 0. 7 3 4 9, \quad N (- 0. 6 2 7 8) = 0. 2 6 5 1
$$ so that


$$ c = 4. 7 6, \quad p = 0. 8 1
$$

Ignoring the time value of money, the stock price has to rise by  $2.76 for the purchaser of the call to break even. Similarly, the stock price has to fall by$ 2.81 for the purchaser of the put to break even.

# 15.10 WARRANTS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

The exercise of a regular call option on a company has no effect on the number of the company's shares outstanding. If the writer of the option does not own the company's shares, he or she must buy them in the market in the usual way and then sell them to the option holder for the strike price. As explained in Chapter 10, warrants and employee stock options are different from regular call options in that exercise leads to the company issuing more shares and then selling them to the option holder for the strike price. As the strike price is less than the market price, this dilutes the interest of the existing shareholders.

How should potential dilution affect the way we value outstanding warrants and employee stock options? The answer is that it should not! Assuming markets are efficient the stock price will reflect potential dilution from all outstanding warrants and employee stock options. This is explained in Business Snapshot 15.3.

Consider next the situation a company is in when it is contemplating a new issue of warrants (or employee stock options). We suppose that the company is interested in calculating the cost of the issue assuming that there are no compensating benefits. We assume that the company has  $N$  shares worth  $S_0$  each and the number of new options contemplated is  $M$ , with each option giving the holder the right to buy one share for  $K$ . The value of the company today is  $NS_0$ . This value does not change as a result of the warrant issue. Suppose that without the warrant issue the share price will be  $S_T$  at the warrant's maturity. This means that (with or without the warrant issue) the total value of the equity and the warrants at time  $T$  will  $NS_T$ . If the warrants are exercised, there is a cash inflow from the strike price increasing this to  $NS_T + MK$ . This value is distributed

# Business Snapshot 15.3 Warrants, Employee Stock Options, and Dilution

Consider a company with 100,000 shares each worth $50. It surprises the market with an announcement that it is granting 100,000 stock options to its employees with a strike price of $50. If the market sees little benefit to the shareholders from the employee stock options in the form of reduced salaries and more highly motivated managers, the stock price will decline immediately after the announcement of the employee stock options. If the stock price declines to $45, the dilution cost to the current shareholders is $5 per share or 500,000 in total.

Suppose that the company does well so that by the end of three years the share price is $100. Suppose further that all the options are exercised at this point. The payoff to the employees is $50 per option. It is tempting to argue that there will be further dilution in that 100,000 shares worth $100 per share are now merged with 100,000 shares for which only $50 is paid, so that (a) the share price reduces to $75 and (b) the payoff to the option holders is only $25 per option. However, this argument is flawed. The exercise of the options is anticipated by the market and already reflected in the share price. The payoff from each option exercised is 50.

This example illustrates the general point that when markets are efficient the impact of dilution from executive stock options or warrants is reflected in the stock price as soon as they are announced and does not need to be taken into account again when the options are valued.

among  $N + M$  shares, so that the share price immediately after exercise becomes

$$
\frac {N S _ {T} + M K}{N + M}
$$

Therefore the payoff to an option holder if the option is exercised is

$$
\frac {N S _ {T} + M K}{N + M} - K
$$ or


$$

\frac {N}{N + M} \left(S _ {T} - K\right)

$$

This shows that the value of each option is the value of

$$

\frac {N}{N + M}

$$ regular call options on the company's stock. Therefore the total cost of the options is  $M$  times this. Since we are assuming that there are no benefits to the company from the warrant issue, the total value of the company's equity will decline by the total cost of the options as soon as the decision to issue the warrants becomes generally known. This means that the reduction in the stock price is

$$
\begin{array}{c} M \\ \hline N + M \end{array}
$$ times the value of a regular call option with strike price  $K$  and maturity  $T$ .


# Example 15.7

A company with 1 million shares worth $40 each is considering issuing 200,000 warrants each giving the holder the right to buy one share with a strike price of $60 in 5 years. It wants to know the cost of this. The interest rate is 3\% per annum, and the volatility is 30\% per annum. The company pays no dividends. From equation (15.20), the value of a 5-year European call option on the stock is 7.04. In this case, N = 1,000,000 and M = 200,000, so that the value of each warrant is

$$

\frac {1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 + 2 0 0 , 0 0 0} \times 7. 0 4 = 5. 8 7

$$ or  $5.87. The total cost of the warrant issue is 200,000 \times 5.87 =$ 1.17 million. Assuming the market perceives no benefits from the warrant issue, we expect the stock price to decline by  $1.17 to$ 38.83.

# 15.11 IMPLIED VOLATILITIES

The one parameter in the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing formulas that cannot be directly observed is the volatility of the stock price. In Section 15.4, we discussed how this can be estimated from a history of the stock price. In practice, traders usually work with what are known as implied volatilities. These are the volatilities implied by option prices observed in the market.[10]

To illustrate how implied volatilities are calculated, suppose that the market price of a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock is 1.875 when  $S_0 = 21$ ,  $K = 20$ ,  $r = 0.1$ , and  $T = 0.25$ . The implied volatility is the value of  $\sigma$  that, when substituted into equation (15.20), gives  $c = 1.875$ . Unfortunately, it is not possible to invert equation (15.20) so that  $\sigma$  is expressed as a function of  $S_0$ ,  $K$ ,  $r$ ,  $T$ , and  $c$ . However, an iterative search procedure can be used to find the implied  $\sigma$ . For example, we can start by trying  $\sigma = 0.20$ . This gives a value of  $c$  equal to 1.76, which is too low. Because  $c$  is an increasing function of  $\sigma$ , a higher value of  $\sigma$  is required. We can next try a value of 0.30 for  $\sigma$ . This gives a value of  $c$  equal to 2.10, which is too high and means that  $\sigma$  must lie between 0.20 and 0.30. Next, a value of 0.25 can be tried for  $\sigma$ . This also proves to be too high, showing that  $\sigma$  lies between 0.20 and 0.25. Proceeding in this way, we can halve the range for  $\sigma$  at each iteration and the correct value of  $\sigma$  can be calculated to any required accuracy.[11] In this example, the implied volatility is 0.235, or 23.5\%, per annum. A similar procedure can be used in conjunction with binomial trees to find implied volatilities for American options.

Implied volatilities are used to monitor the market's opinion about the volatility of a particular stock. Whereas historical volatilities (see Section 15.4) are backward looking, implied volatilities are forward looking. Traders often quote the implied volatility of an option rather than its price. This is convenient because the implied volatility tends to be less variable than the option price. The implied volatilities of actively traded options on an asset are often used by traders to estimate appropriate implied volatilities for other options on the asset.

# The VIX Index

The CBOE publishes indices of implied volatility. The most popular index, the SPX VIX, is an index of the implied volatility of 30-day options on the S&P 500 calculated from a wide range of calls and puts. It is sometimes referred to as the "fear factor." An index value of 15 indicates that the implied volatility of 30-day options on the S&P 500 is estimated as  $15\%$ . Information on the way the index is calculated is in Section 26.16. Trading in futures on the VIX started in 2004 and trading in options on the VIX started in 2006. One contract is on 1,000 times the index.

# Example 15.8

Suppose that a trader buys an April futures contract on the VIX when the futures price is 18.5 (corresponding to a 30-day S&P 500 volatility of  $18.5\%$ ) and closes out the contract when the futures price is 19.3 (corresponding to an S&P 500 volatility of  $19.3\%$ ). The trader makes a gain of 800.

A trade involving options on the S&P 500 is a bet on the future level of the S&P 500, which depends on the volatility of the S&P 500. By contrast, a futures or options contract on the VIX is a bet only on volatility. Figure 15.4 shows the VIX index between January 2004 and June 2020. Between 2004 and mid-2007 it tended to stay between 10 and 20. It reached 30 during the second half of 2007 and a record 80 in October and November 2008 after Lehman's bankruptcy. By early 2010, it had declined to more normal levels. It has spiked several times since 2010 because of stresses and uncertainties in financial markets. In 2020, there was another big increase because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

VIX monitors the volatility of the S&P 500. The CBOE publishes a range of other volatility indices. These are on other stock indices, commodity indices, interest rates, currencies, and some individual stocks (for example, Amazon and Goldman Sachs). There is even a volatility index of the VIX index (VVIX).

# 15.12 DIVIDENDS

Up to now, we have assumed that the stock on which the option is written pays no dividends. In this section, we modify the Black-Scholes-Merton model to take account of dividends. We assume that the amount and timing of the dividends during the life of an option can be predicted with certainty. When options last for relatively short periods of time, this assumption is not too unreasonable. (For long-life options it is usual to assume that the dividend yield rather than the dollar dividend payments are known. Options can then be valued as will be described in the Chapter 17.) The date on which the dividend is paid should be assumed to be the ex-dividend date. On this date the stock price declines by the amount of the dividend.[12]

# European Options

European options can be analyzed by assuming that the stock price is the sum of two components: a riskless component that corresponds to the known dividends during the life of the option and a risky component. The riskless component, at any given time, is the present value of all the dividends during the life of the option discounted from the ex-dividend dates to the present at the risk-free rate. By the time the option matures, the dividends will have been paid and the riskless component will no longer exist. The Black-Scholes-Merton formula is therefore correct if  $S_0$  is equal to the risky component of the stock price and  $\sigma$  is the volatility of the process followed by the risky component.[13]

Operationally, this means that the Black-Scholes-Merton formulas can be used provided that the stock price is reduced by the present value of all the dividends during the life of the option, the discounting being done from the ex-dividend dates at the risk-free rate. As already mentioned, a dividend is counted as being during the life of the option only if its ex-dividend date occurs during the life of the option.

# Example 15.9

Consider a European call option on a stock when there are ex-dividend dates in two months and five months. The dividend on each ex-dividend date is expected to be  $0.50. The current share price is$ 40, the exercise price is 40, the stock price volatility is 30\% per annum, the risk-free rate of interest is 9\% per annum, and the time to maturity is six months. The present value of the dividends is

$$
0. 5 e ^ {- 0. 0 9 \times 2 / 1 2} + 0. 5 e ^ {- 0. 0 9 \times 5 / 1 2} = 0. 9 7 4 2
$$

The option price can therefore be calculated from the Black-Scholes-Merton formula, with  $S_0 = 40 - 0.9742 = 39.0258$ ,  $K = 40$ ,  $r = 0.09$ ,  $\sigma = 0.3$ , and  $T = 0.5$ :

$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (3 9 . 0 2 5 8 / 4 0) + (0 . 0 9 + 0 . 3 ^ {2} / 2) \times 0 . 5}{0 . 3 \sqrt {0 . 5}} = 0. 2 0 2 0
$$

$$ d _ {2} = \frac {\ln (3 9 . 0 2 5 8 / 4 0) + (0 . 0 9 - 0 . 3 ^ {2} / 2) \times 0 . 5}{0 . 3 \sqrt {0 . 5}} = - 0. 0 1 0 2
$$

Using the NORMSDIST function in Excel gives

$$
N \left(d _ {1}\right) = 0. 5 8 0 0, \quad N \left(d _ {2}\right) = 0. 4 9 5 9
$$ and, from equation (15.20), the call price is


$$

3 9. 0 2 5 8 \times 0. 5 8 0 0 - 4 0 e ^ {- 0. 0 9 \times 0. 5} \times 0. 4 9 5 9 = 3. 6 7

$$ or 3.67.


Some researchers have criticized the approach just described for calculating the value of a European option on a dividend-paying stock. They argue that volatility should be applied to the stock price, not to the stock price less the present value of dividends. A number of different numerical procedures have been suggested for doing this.[14] When volatility is calculated from historical data, it might make sense to use one of these procedures. However, in practice the volatility used to price an option is nearly always implied from the prices of other options using procedures we will outline in Chapter 20. If an analyst uses the same model for both implying and applying volatilities, the resulting prices should be accurate and not highly model dependent. Another important point is that in practice, as will be explained in Chapter 18, practitioners usually value a European option in terms of the forward price of the underlying asset. This avoids the need to estimate explicitly the income that is expected from the asset. The volatility of the forward stock price is the same as the volatility of a variable equal to the stock price minus the present value of dividends.

The model we have proposed where the stock price is divided into two components is internally consistent and widely used in practice. We will use the same model when valuing American options in Chapter 21.

# American Call Options

Consider next American call options. Chapter 11 showed that in the absence of dividends American options should never be exercised early. An extension to the argument shows that, when there are dividends, it can only be optimal to exercise at a time immediately before the stock goes ex-dividend. We assume that  $n$  ex-dividend dates are anticipated and that they are at times  $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n$ , with  $t_1 < t_2 < \ldots < t_n$ . The dividends corresponding to these times will be denoted by  $D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_n$ , respectively.

We start by considering the possibility of early exercise just prior to the final ex-dividend date (i.e., at time  $t_n$ ). If the option is exercised at time  $t_n$ , the investor receives

$$

S (t _ {n}) - K

$$ where  $S(t)$  denotes the stock price at time  $t$ . If the option is not exercised, the stock price drops to  $S(t_{n}) - D_{n}$ . As shown by equation (11.4), the value of the option is then greater than

$$
S \left(t _ {n}\right) - D _ {n} - K e ^ {- r \left(T - t _ {n}\right)}
$$

It follows that, if

$$
S (t _ {n}) - D _ {n} - K e ^ {- r (T - t _ {n})} \geq S (t _ {n}) - K
$$ that is,


$$

D _ {n} \leq K \left[ 1 - e ^ {- r (T - t _ {n})} \right] \tag {15.23}

$$ it cannot be optimal to exercise at time  $t_n$ . On the other hand, if

$$
D _ {n} > K \left[ 1 - e ^ {- r \left(T - t _ {n}\right)} \right] \tag {15.24}
$$ for any reasonable assumption about the stochastic process followed by the stock price, it can be shown that it is always optimal to exercise at time  $t_n$  for a sufficiently high value of  $S(t_n)$ . The inequality in (15.24) will tend to be satisfied when the final ex-dividend date is fairly close to the maturity of the option (i.e.,  $T - t_n$  is small) and the dividend is large.


Consider next time  $t_{n-1}$ , the penultimate ex-dividend date. If the option is exercised immediately prior to time  $t_{n-1}$ , the investor receives  $S(t_{n-1}) - K$ . If the option is not exercised at time  $t_{n-1}$ , the stock price drops to  $S(t_{n-1}) - D_{n-1}$  and the earliest subsequent time at which exercise could take place is  $t_n$ . Hence, from equation (11.4), a lower bound to the option price if it is not exercised at time  $t_{n-1}$  is

$$

S \left(t _ {n - 1}\right) - D _ {n - 1} - K e ^ {- r \left(t _ {n} - t _ {n - 1}\right)}

$$

It follows that if

$$

S \left(t _ {n - 1}\right) - D _ {n - 1} - K e ^ {- r \left(t _ {n} - t _ {n - 1}\right)} \geq S \left(t _ {n - 1}\right) - K

$$ or


$$

D _ {n - 1} \leq K \left[ 1 - e ^ {- r \left(t _ {n} - t _ {n - 1}\right)} \right]

$$ it is not optimal to exercise immediately prior to time  $t_{n-1}$ . Similarly, for any  $i < n$ , if

$$
D _ {i} \leq K \left[ 1 - e ^ {- r \left(t _ {i + 1} - t _ {i}\right)} \right] \tag {15.25}
$$ it is not optimal to exercise immediately prior to time  $t_i$ .


The inequality in (15.25) is approximately equivalent to

$$

D _ {i} \leq K r \left(t _ {i + 1} - t _ {i}\right)

$$

Assuming that  $K$  is fairly close to the current stock price, this inequality is satisfied when the dividend yield on the stock is less than the risk-free rate of interest. This is often not true in low interest environments.

We can conclude from this analysis that, in many circumstances, the most likely time for the early exercise of an American call is immediately before the final ex-dividend date,  $t_n$ . Furthermore, if inequality (15.25) holds for  $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n - 1$  and inequality (15.23) holds, we can be certain that early exercise is never optimal, and the American option can be treated as a European option.

# Black's Approximation

Black suggests an approximate procedure for taking account of early exercise in call options.[15] This involves calculating, as described earlier in this section, the prices of European options that mature at times  $T$  and  $t_n$ , and then setting the American price equal to the greater of the two.[16] This is an approximation because it in effect assumes the option holder has to decide at time zero whether the option will be exercised at time  $T$  or  $t_n$ .

# SUMMARY

We started this chapter by examining the properties of the process for stock prices introduced in Chapter 14. The process implies that the price of a stock at some future time, given its price today, is lognormal. It also implies that the continuously compounded return from the stock in a period of time is normally distributed. Our uncertainty about future stock prices increases as we look further ahead. The standard deviation of the logarithm of the stock price is proportional to the square root of how far ahead we are looking.

To estimate the volatility  $\sigma$  of a stock price empirically, the stock price is observed at fixed intervals of time (e.g., every day, every week, or every month). For each time period, the natural logarithm of the ratio of the stock price at the end of the time period to the stock price at the beginning of the time period is calculated. The volatility is estimated as the standard deviation of these numbers divided by the square root of the length of the time period in years. Usually, days when the exchanges are closed are ignored in measuring time for the purposes of volatility calculations.

The differential equation for the price of any derivative dependent on a stock can be obtained by creating a riskless portfolio of the derivative and the stock. Because the derivative's price and the stock price both depend on the same underlying source of uncertainty, this can always be done. The portfolio that is created remains riskless for only a very short period of time. However, the return on a riskless portfolio must always be the risk-free interest rate if there are to be no arbitrage opportunities.

The expected return on the stock does not enter into the Black-Scholes-Merton differential equation. This leads to an extremely useful result known as risk-neutral valuation. This result states that when valuing a derivative dependent on a stock price, we can assume that the world is risk neutral. This means that we can assume that the expected return from the stock is the risk-free interest rate, and then discount expected payoffs at the risk-free interest rate. The Black-Scholes-Merton equations for European call and put options can be derived by either solving their differential equation or by using risk-neutral valuation.

An implied volatility is the volatility that, when used in conjunction with the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula, gives the market price of the option. Traders monitor implied volatilities. They often quote the implied volatility of an option rather than its price. They have developed procedures for using the volatilities implied by the prices of actively traded options to estimate volatilities for other options on the same asset.


The Black-Scholes-Merton results can be extended to cover European call and put options on dividend-paying stocks. The procedure is to use the Black-Scholes-Merton formula with the stock price reduced by the present value of the dividends anticipated during the life of the option, and the volatility equal to the volatility of the stock price net of the present value of these dividends.

It can be optimal to exercise American call options immediately before any ex-dividend date, but in practice early exercise is most likely on the final ex-dividend date. Fischer Black has suggested an approximation. This involves setting the American call option price equal to the greater of two European call option prices. The first European call option expires at the same time as the American call option; the second expires immediately prior to the final ex-dividend date.

E \left[ \max  (K - V, 0) \right] = K N (- d _ {2}) - E (V) N (- d _ {1})

$$ and use this to derive the Black-Scholes-Merton formula for the price of a European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock.


# APPENDIX

# PROOF OF THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON FORMULA USING RISK-NEUTRAL VALUATION

We will prove the Black-Scholes result by first proving another key result that will also be useful in future chapters.

# Key Result

If  $V$  is lognormally distributed and the standard deviation of  $\ln V$  is  $w$ , then

$$

E \left[ \max  (V - K, 0) \right] = E (V) N \left(d _ {1}\right) - K N \left(d _ {2}\right) \tag {15A.1}

$$ where


$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln [ E (V) / K ] + w ^ {2} / 2}{w}
$$

$$ d _ {2} = \frac {\ln [ E (V) / K ] - w ^ {2} / 2}{w}
$$ and  $E$  denotes the expected value. (See Problem 15.37 for a similar result for puts.)


# Proof of Key Result

Define  $g(V)$  as the probability density function of  $V$ . It follows that

$$

E [ \max  (V - K, 0) ] = \int_ {K} ^ {\infty} (V - K) g (V) d V \tag {15A.2}

$$

The variable  $\ln V$  is normally distributed with standard deviation  $w$ . From the properties of the lognormal distribution, the mean of  $\ln V$  is  $m$ , where

$$ m = \ln [ E (V) ] - w ^ {2} / 2 \tag {15A.3}
$$

Define a new variable

$$
Q = \frac {\ln V - m}{w} \tag {15A.4}
$$

This variable is normally distributed with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1.0. Denote the density function for  $Q$  by  $h(Q)$  so that

$$ h (Q) = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2 \pi}} e ^ {- Q ^ {2} / 2}
$$

Using equation (15A.4) to convert the expression on the right-hand side of equation (15A.2) from an integral over  $V$  to an integral over  $Q$ , we get

$$
E \left[ \max  (V - K, 0) \right] = \int_ {(\ln K - m) / w} ^ {\infty} \left(e ^ {Q w + m} - K\right) h (Q) d Q
$$ or


$$

E \left[ \max  (V - K, 0) \right] = \int_ {(\ln K - m) / w} ^ {\infty} e ^ {Q w + m} h (Q) d Q - K \int_ {(\ln K - m) / w} ^ {\infty} h (Q) d Q \tag {15A.5}

$$

Now

$$

\begin{array}{l} e ^ {Q w + m} h (Q) = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2 \pi}} e ^ {(- Q ^ {2} + 2 Q w + 2 m) / 2} = \frac {1}{\sqrt {2 \pi}} e ^ {[ - (Q - w) ^ {2} + 2 m + w ^ {2} ] / 2} \\ = \frac {e ^ {m + w ^ {2} / 2}}{\sqrt {2 \pi}} e ^ {\left[ - (Q - w) ^ {2} \right] / 2} = e ^ {m + w ^ {2} / 2} h (Q - w) \\ \end{array}

$$

This means that equation (15A.5) becomes

$$

E \left[ \max  (V - K, 0) \right] = e ^ {m + w ^ {2} / 2} \int_ {(\ln K - m) / w} ^ {\infty} h (Q - w) d Q - K \int_ {(\ln K - m) / w} ^ {\infty} h (Q) d Q \tag {15A.6}

$$

If we define  $N(x)$  as the probability that a variable with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1.0 is less than  $x$ , the first integral in equation (15A.6) is

$$

1 - N [ (\ln K - m) / w - w ] = N [ (- \ln K + m) / w + w ]

$$

Substituting for  $m$  from equation (15A.3) leads to

$$

N \left(\frac {\ln [ E (V) / K ] + w ^ {2} / 2}{w}\right) = N \left(d _ {1}\right)

$$

Similarly the second integral in equation (15A.6) is  $N(d_{2})$ . Equation (15A.6), therefore, becomes

$$

E \left[ \max  (V - K, 0) \right] = e ^ {m + w ^ {2} / 2} N \left(d _ {1}\right) - K N \left(d _ {2}\right)

$$

Substituting for  $m$  from equation (15A.3) gives the key result.

# The Black-Scholes-Merton Result

We now consider a call option on a non-dividend-paying stock maturing at time  $T$ . The strike price is  $K$ , the risk-free rate is  $r$ , the current stock price is  $S_0$ , and the volatility is  $\sigma$ . As shown in equation (15.22), the call price  $c$  is given by

$$ c = e ^ {- r T} \hat {E} [ \max  (S _ {T} - K, 0) ] \tag {15A.7}
$$ where  $S_{T}$  is the stock price at time  $T$  and  $\hat{E}$  denotes the expectation in a risk-neutral world. Under the stochastic process assumed by Black-Scholes-Merton,  $S_{T}$  is lognormal. Also, from equations (15.3) and (15.4),  $\hat{E}(S_{T}) = S_{0}e^{rT}$  and the standard deviation of  $\ln S_{T}$  is  $\sigma \sqrt{T}$ .


From the key result just proved, equation (15A.7) implies

$$ c = e ^ {- r T} \left[ S _ {0} e ^ {r T} N \left(d _ {1}\right) - K N \left(d _ {2}\right) \right] = S _ {0} N \left(d _ {1}\right) - K e ^ {- r T} N \left(d _ {2}\right)
$$ where


$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln [ \hat {E} (S _ {T}) / K ] + \sigma^ {2} T / 2}{\sigma \sqrt {T}} = \frac {\ln (S _ {0} / K) + (r + \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}
$$

$$ d _ {2} = \frac {\ln [ \hat {E} (S _ {T}) / K ] - \sigma^ {2} T / 2}{\sigma \sqrt {T}} = \frac {\ln (S _ {0} / K) + (r - \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}
$$

This is the Black-Scholes-Merton result.

# Employee Stock Options

Employee stock options are call options on a company's stock granted by the company to its employees. The options give the employees a stake in the fortunes of the company. If the company does well so that the company's stock price moves above the strike price, employees gain by exercising the options and then selling the stock they acquire at the market price.

Many companies, particularly technology companies, feel that the only way they can attract and keep the best employees is to offer them attractive stock option packages. Some companies grant options only to senior management; others grant them to people at all levels in the organization. Microsoft was one of the first companies to use employee stock options. All Microsoft employees were granted options and, as the company's stock price rose, it is estimated that over 10,000 of them became millionaires. Employee stock options have become less popular in recent years for reasons we will explain in this chapter. (Microsoft, for example, announced in 2003 that it would discontinue the use of options and award shares of Microsoft to employees instead.) But many companies throughout the world continue to be enthusiastic users of employee stock options.

Employee stock options are popular with start-up companies. Often these companies do not have the resources to pay key employees as much as they could earn with an established company and they solve this problem by supplementing the salaries of the employees with stock options. If the company does well and shares are sold to the public in an initial public offering (IPO), the options are likely to prove to be very valuable. Some newly formed companies have even granted options to students who worked for just a few months during their summer break—and in some cases this has led to windfalls of hundreds of thousands of dollars for the students.

This chapter explains how stock option plans work and how their popularity has been influenced by their accounting treatment. It discusses whether employee stock options help to align the interests of shareholders with those of top executives running a company. It also describes how these options are valued and looks at backdating scandals.

# 16.1 CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

Employee stock options often last as long as 10 to 15 years. Very often the strike price is set equal to the stock price on the grant date so that the option is initially at the money.

The following are common features of employee stock option plans:

1. There is a vesting period during which the options cannot be exercised. This vesting period can be as long as four years.
2. When employees leave their jobs (voluntarily or involuntarily) during the vesting period, they forfeit their options.
3. When employees leave (voluntarily or involuntarily) after the vesting period, they forfeit options that are out of the money and they have to exercise vested options that are in the money almost immediately.
4. Employees are not permitted to sell the options.
5. When an employee exercises options, the company issues new shares and sells them to the employee for the strike price.

# The Early Exercise Decision

The fourth feature of employee stock option plans noted above has important implications. If employees, for whatever reason, want to realize a cash benefit from options that have vested, they must exercise the options and sell the underlying shares. They cannot sell the options to someone else. This leads to a tendency for employee stock options to be exercised earlier than similar exchange-traded or over-the-counter call options.

Consider a call option on a stock paying no dividends. In Section 11.5 we showed that, if it is a regular call option, it should never be exercised early. The holder of the option will always do better by selling the option rather than exercising it before the end of its life. However, the arguments we used in Section 11.5 are not applicable to employee stock options because they cannot be sold. The only way employees can realize a cash benefit from the options (or diversify their holdings) is by exercising the options and selling the stock. It is therefore not unusual for an employee stock option to be exercised well before it would be optimal to exercise the option if it were a regular exchange-traded or over-the-counter option.

Should an employee ever exercise his or her options before maturity and then keep the stock rather than selling it? Assume that the option's strike price is constant during the life of the option and the option can be exercised at any time. To answer the question we consider two options: the employee stock option and an otherwise identical regular option that can be sold in the market. We refer to the first option as option A and the second as option B. If the stock pays no dividends, we know that option B should never be exercised early. It follows that it is not optimal to exercise option A and keep the stock. If the employee wants to maintain a stake in his or her company, a better strategy is to keep the option. This delays paying the strike price and maintains the insurance value of the option, as described in Section 11.5. Only when it is optimal to exercise option B can it be a rational strategy for an employee to exercise option A before maturity and keep the stock. As discussed in Section 15.12, it is optimal to exercise option B only when a relatively high dividend is imminent.

In practice the early exercise behavior of employees varies widely from company to company. In some companies, there is a culture of not exercising early; in others, employees tend to exercise options and sell the stock soon after the end of the vesting period, even if the options are only slightly in the money.

# 16.2 DO OPTIONS ALIGN THE INTERESTS OF SHAREHOLDERS AND MANAGERS?

For investors to have confidence in capital markets, it is important that the interests of shareholders and managers are reasonably well aligned. This means that managers should be motivated to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders. Managers are the agents of the shareholders and, as mentioned in Chapter 8, economists use the term agency costs to describe the losses experienced when the interests of agents and principals are not aligned.

Do employee stock options help align the interests of employees and shareholders? The answer to this question is not straightforward. There can be little doubt that they serve a useful purpose for a start-up company. The options are an excellent way for the main shareholders, who are usually also senior executives, to motivate employees to work long hours. If the company is successful and there is an IPO, the employees will do very well; but if the company is unsuccessful, the options will be worthless.

It is the options granted to the senior executives of publicly traded companies that are most controversial. Executive stock options are sometimes referred to as an executive's "pay for performance." If the company's stock price goes up, so that shareholders make gains, the executive is rewarded. However, this overlooks the asymmetric payoffs of options. If the company does badly then the shareholders lose money, but all that happens to the executives is that they fail to make a gain. Unlike the shareholders, they do not experience a loss. Many people think that a better type of pay for performance is a restricted stock unit. This entitles the executive to own a share of the company's stock at a particular future time (the vesting date). The gains and losses of the executives then mirror those of other shareholders. It is sometimes argued that the asymmetric payoffs of options can lead to senior executives taking risks they would not otherwise take. This may or may not be in the interests of the company's shareholders.

What temptations do stock options create for a senior executive? Suppose an executive plans to exercise a large number of stock options in three months and sell the stock. He or she might be tempted to time announcements of good news—or even move earnings from one quarter to another—so that the stock price increases just before the options are exercised. Alternatively, if at-the-money options are due to be granted to the executive in three months, the executive might be tempted to take actions that reduce the stock price just before the grant date. The type of behavior we are talking about here is of course totally unacceptable—and may well be illegal. But the backdating scandals, which are discussed later in this chapter, show that the way some executives have handled issues related to stock options leaves much to be desired.

Even when there is no impropriety of the type we have just mentioned, executive stock options are liable to have the effect of motivating executives to focus on short-term profits at the expense of longer-term performance. Managers of large funds worry that, because stock options are such a huge component of an executive's compensation, they are liable to be a big source of distraction. Senior management may spend too much time thinking about all the different aspects of their compensation and not enough time running the company.

A manager's inside knowledge and ability to affect outcomes and announcements is always liable to interact with his or her trading in a way that is to the disadvantage of other shareholders. One radical suggestion for mitigating this problem is to require executives to give notice to the market—perhaps one week's notice—of an intention to buy or sell their company's stock. (Once the notice of an intention to trade had been given, it would be binding on the executive.) This allows the market to form its own conclusions about why the executive is trading. As a result, the price may increase before the executive buys and decrease before the executive sells.

# 16.3 ACCOUNTING ISSUES

An employee stock option represents a cost to the company and a benefit to the employee just like any other form of compensation. This point, which for many is self-evident, is actually quite controversial. Many corporate executives appear to believe that an option has no value unless it is in the money. As a result, they argue that an at-the-money option issued by the company is not a cost to the company. The reality is that, if options are valuable to employees, they must represent a cost to the company's shareholders—and therefore to the company. There is no free lunch. The cost to the company of the options arises from the fact that the company has agreed that, if its stock does well, it will sell shares to employees at a price less than that which would apply in the open market.

Prior to 1995, the cost charged to the income statement of a company when it issued stock options was the intrinsic value. Most options were at the money when they were first issued, so that this cost was zero. In 1995, accounting standard FAS 123 was issued. Many people expected it to require the expensing of options at their fair value. However, as a result of intense lobbying, the 1995 version of FAS 123 only encouraged companies to expense the fair value of the options they granted on the income statement. It did not require them to do so. If fair value was not expensed on the income statement, it had to be reported in a footnote to the company's accounts.

Accounting standards have now changed to require the expensing of all stock-based compensation at its fair value on the income statement. In February 2004, the International Accounting Standards Board issued IAS 2 requiring companies to start expensing stock options in 2005. In December 2004, FAS 123 was revised to require the expensing of employee stock options in the United States starting in 2005.

The effect of the new accounting standards is to require options to be valued on the grant date and the amount to be recorded as an expense in the income statement for the year in which the grant is made. Valuation at a time later than the grant date is not required. It can be argued that options should be revalued at financial year ends (or every quarter) until they are exercised or reach the end of their lives. This would treat them in the same way as other derivative transactions entered into by the company. If the option became more valuable from one year to the next, there would then be an additional amount to be expensed. However, if it declined in value, there would be a positive impact on income.

This approach would have a number of advantages. The cumulative charge to the company would reflect the actual cost of the options (either zero if the options are not exercised or the option payoff if they are exercised). Although the charge in any year would depend on the option pricing model used, the cumulative charge over the life of the option would not. Arguably there would be much less incentive for the company to engage in the backdating practices described later in the chapter. The disadvantage usually cited for accounting in this way is that it is undesirable because it introduces volatility into the income statement.

# Alternatives to Stock Options

The accounting rules which came into effect in 2005 have led companies to consider alternatives to traditional compensation plans where at-the-money stock options are granted. We have already mentioned restricted stock units (RSUs), which are shares that will be owned by the employee at a future time (the vesting date). Many companies have replaced stock options by RSUs. A variation on an RSU is a market-leveraged stock unit (MSU), in which the number of shares that will be owned on the vesting date is equal to  $S_T / S_0$ , where  $S_0$  is the stock price on the grant date and  $S_T$  is the stock price on the vesting date.

If the stock market as a whole goes up, employees with stock options tend to do well, even if their own company's stock price underperforms the market. One way of overcoming this problem is to tie the strike price of the options to the performance of a broadly based index. Suppose that on the option grant date the stock price is  $30 and the index is 2,000. The strike price would initially be set at$ 30. If the index increased by 10\% to 2,200, then the strike price would also increase by 10\% to $33. If the index moved down by 15\% to 1,700, then the strike price would also move down by 15\% to $25.50. The effect of this is that the company's stock price performance has to beat that of the index to become in the money. As an alternative to using a broadly based index as the reference index, the company could use an index of the prices of stocks in the same industrial sector as the company.

# 16.4 VALUATION

Accounting standards give companies quite a bit of latitude in choosing a method for valuing employee stock options. In this section we review some of the alternatives.

# Using the Black-Scholes-Merton Model

A frequently used approach is based on what is known as the option's expected life. This is the average time for which employees hold the option before it is exercised or expires. The expected life can be approximately estimated from historical data on the early exercise behavior of employees and reflects the vesting period, the impact of employees leaving the company, and the tendency we mentioned in Section 16.1 for employee stock options to be exercised earlier than regular options. The Black-Scholes-Merton model is used with the life of the option,  $T$ , set equal to the expected life. The volatility is usually estimated from several years of historical data as described in Section 15.4.

It should be emphasized that using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula in this way has no theoretical validity. There is no reason why the value of a European stock option with the time to maturity,  $T$ , set equal to the expected life should be approximately the same as the value of the American-style employee stock option that we are interested in. However, the results given by the model are not unreasonable in many situations. Companies, when reporting their employee stock option expense, will frequently mention the volatility and expected life used in their Black-Scholes-Merton computations.

# Example 16.1

A company grants 1,000,000 options to its executives on November 1, 2021. The stock price on that date is  $30 and the strike price of the options is also$ 30. The options last for 10 years and vest after three years. The company has issued similar at-the-money options for the last 10 years. The average time to exercise or expiry of these options is 4.5 years. The company therefore decides to use an "expected life" of 4.5 years. It estimates the long-term volatility of the stock price, using 5 years of historical data, to be 25\%. The present value of dividends during the next 4.5 years is estimated to be $4. The 4.5-year zero-coupon risk-free interest rate is 5\%. The option is therefore valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton model (adjusted for dividends in the way described in Section 15.12) with  $S_0 = 30 - 4 = 26$ ,  $K = 30$ ,  $r = 5\%$ ,  $\sigma = 25\%$ , and  $T = 4.5$ . The Black-Scholes-Merton formula gives the value of one option as $6.31. Hence, the income statement expense is 1,000,000 × 6.31, or 6,310,000.

# Binomial Tree Approach

A more sophisticated approach to valuing employee stock options involves building a binomial tree as outlined in Chapter 13 and adjusting the rules used when rolling back through the tree to reflect (a) whether the option has vested, (b) the probability of the employee leaving the company, and (c) the probability of the employee choosing to exercise the option. The terms of the option define whether the option has vested at different nodes of the tree. Historical data on turnover rates for employees can be used to estimate the probability of the option being either prematurely exercised or forfeited at a node because the employee leaves the company. The probability of an employee choosing to exercise the option at different nodes of the tree is more difficult to quantify. Clearly this probability increases as the ratio of the stock price to the strike price increases and as the time to the option's maturity declines. If enough historical data is available, the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables can be estimated—at least approximately.

# Example 16.2

Suppose a company grants stock options that last 8 years and vest after 3 years. The stock price and strike price are both $40. The stock price volatility is  $30\%$ , the risk-free rate is  $5\%$ , and the company pays no dividends. Figure 16.1 shows how a four-step tree could be used to value the option. (This is for illustration; in practice more time steps would be used.) In this case,  $\sigma = 0.3$ ,  $\Delta t = 2$ , and  $r = 0.05$ , so that, with the notation of Chapter 13,  $a = e^{0.05 \times 2} = 1.1052$ ,  $u = e^{0.3\sqrt{2}} = 1.5285$ ,  $d = 1 / u = 0.6543$ , and  $p = (a - d) / (u - d) = 0.5158$ . The probability on the "up branches" is 0.5158 and the probability on the "down branches" is 0.4842. There are three nodes where early exercise could be desirable: D, G, and H. (The option has not vested at node B and is not in the money at the other nodes prior to maturity.) We assume that the probabilities that the holder will choose to exercise at nodes D, G, and H (conditional on no earlier exercise) have been estimated as  $40\%$ ,  $80\%$ , and  $30\%$ , respectively. We suppose that the probability of an employee leaving the company during each time step is  $5\%$ . (This corresponds to an employee turnover rate of approximately  $2.5\%$  per year.) For the purposes of the calculation, it is assumed that employees always leave at the end of a time period. If an employee leaves the company before an option has vested or when the option is out of the money, the option is forfeited. In other cases the option must be exercised immediately.

At each node:

Upper value = Underlying asset price

Lower value = Option price

Values in bold are a result of early exercise.

Figure 16.1 Valuation of employee stock option in Example 16.2.

The value of the option at the final nodes is its intrinsic value. Consider the nodes at time 6 years. Nodes I and J are easy. Since these nodes are certain to lead to nodes where the option is worth nothing, the value of the option is zero at these nodes. At node H there is a  $30\%$  chance that the employee will choose to exercise the option. In cases where the employee does not choose to exercise, there is a  $5\%$  chance that the employee leaves the company and has to exercise. The total probability of exercise is therefore  $0.3 + 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.335$ . If the option is exercised, its value is  $61.14 - 40 = 21.14$ . If it is not exercised, its value is

$$ e ^ {- 0. 0 5 \times 2} (0. 5 1 5 8 \times 5 3. 4 5 + 0. 4 8 4 2 \times 0) = 2 4. 9 5
$$

The value of the option at node H is therefore

$$
0. 3 3 5 \times 2 1. 1 4 + 0. 6 6 5 \times 2 4. 9 5 = 2 3. 6 7
$$

The value at node G is similarly

$$
0. 8 1 \times 1 0 2. 8 3 + 0. 1 9 \times 1 0 6. 6 4 = 1 0 3. 5 6
$$

We now move on to the nodes at time 4 years. At node F the option is clearly worth zero. At node E there is a  $5\%$  chance that the employee will forfeit the option because he or she leaves the company and a  $95\%$  chance that the option will be retained. In the latter case the option is worth

$$ e ^ {- 0. 0 5 \times 2} (0. 5 1 5 8 \times 2 3. 6 7 + 0. 4 8 4 2 \times 0) = 1 1. 0 5
$$

The option is therefore worth  $0.95 \times 11.05 = 10.49$ . At node D there is a 0.43 probability that the option will be exercised and a 0.57 chance that it will be retained. The value of the option is 56.44.

Consider next the initial node and the nodes at time 2 years. The option has not vested at these nodes. There is a  $5\%$  chance that the option will be forfeited and a  $95\%$  chance that it will be retained for a further 2 years. This leads to the valuations shown in Figure 16.1. The valuation of the option at the initial node is 14.97. (This compares with a valuation of 17.98 for a regular option using the same tree.)

# Exercise Multiple Approach

Hull and White suggest a simple model where an employee exercises as soon as the option has vested and the ratio of the stock price to the strike price is above a certain level. They refer to the ratio of stock price to strike price that triggers exercise as the "exercise multiple". The option can be valued using a binomial or trinomial tree. As outlined in Section 27.6, it is important to construct a binomial or trinomial tree where nodes lie on the stock prices that will lead to exercise. For example, if the strike price is  $30 and the assumption is that employees exercise when the ratio of the stock price to the strike price is 1.5, the tree should be constructed so that there are nodes at a stock price level of$ 45. The tree calculations are similar to those for Example 16.2 and take account of the probability of an employee leaving the company. To estimate the exercise multiple, it is necessary to calculate from historical data the average ratio of stock price to strike price at the time of exercise. (Exercises at maturity and those arising from the termination of the employee's job are not included in the calculation of the average.) This may be easier to estimate from historical data than the expected life because the latter is quite heavily dependent on the particular path that has been followed by the stock's price.

# A Market-Based Approach

One way of valuing an employee stock option is to see what the market would pay for it. Cisco was the first to try this in 2006. It proposed selling options with the exact terms of its employee stock options to institutional investors. This approach was rejected by the SEC on the grounds that the range of investors bidding for the options was not wide enough.

Zions Bancorp has suggested an alternative approach. It proposed that securities providing payoffs mirroring those actually realized by its employees be sold. Suppose that the strike price for a particular grant to employees is  $40 and it turns out that 1\%$  of employees exercise after exactly 5 years when the stock price is 60,  $2\%$  exercise after exactly 6 years when the stock price is $65, and so on. Then  $1\%$  of the securities owned by an investor will provide a $20 payoff after 5 years,  $2\%$  will provide a payoff of 25 after 6 years, and so on.

Zions Bancorp tested the idea using its own stock option grant to its employees. It sold the securities using a Dutch auction process. In this individuals or companies can submit a bid indicating the price they are prepared to pay and the number of options they are prepared to buy. The clearing price is the highest bid such that the aggregate number of options sought at that price or a higher price equals or exceeds the number of options for sale. Buyers who have bid more than the clearing price get their orders filled at the clearing price and the buyer who bid the clearing price gets the remainder. Zions Bancorp announced that it had received SEC approval for its market-based approach in October 2007, but the approach has not been used to any great extent.

# Dilution

The fact that a company issues new stock when an employee stock option is exercised leads to some dilution for existing stock holders because new shares are being sold to employees at below the current stock price. It is natural to assume that this dilution takes place at the time the option is exercised. However, this is not the case. As explained in Section 15.10, stock prices are diluted when the market first hears about a stock option grant. The possible exercise of options is anticipated and immediately reflected in the stock price. This point is emphasized by the example in Business Snapshot 15.3.

The stock price immediately after a grant is announced to the public reflects any dilution. Provided that this stock price is used in the valuation of the option, it is not necessary to adjust the option price for dilution. In many instances the market expects a company to make regular stock option grants and so the market price of the stock anticipates dilution even before the announcement is made.

If a company is contemplating a stock option grant that will surprise the market, the cost can be calculated as described in Example 15.7. This cost can be compared with benefits such as lower regular employee remuneration and less employee turnover.

# 16.5 THE BACKDATING SCANDAL

No discussion of employee stock options would be complete without mentioning a backdating scandal. Backdating is the practice of marking a document with a date that precedes the current date.

Suppose that a company decides to grant at-the-money options to its executives on April 30 when the stock price is $50. If the stock price was $42 on April 3, it is tempting to behave as if those the options were granted on April 3 and use a strike price of $42. This is legal provided that the company reports the options as $8 in the money on the date when the decision to grant the options is made, April 30. But it is illegal for the company to report the options as at-the-money and granted on April 3. The value on April 3 of an option with a strike price of 42 is much less than its value on April 30. Shareholders are misled about the true cost of the decision to grant options if the company reports the options as granted on April 3.

Prior to 2002, it appears that backdating was not uncommon. Early research by Yermack shows that stock prices tend to increase after reported grant dates.[10] Lie extended Yermack's work, showing that stock prices also tended to decrease before reported grant dates.[11] The period covered by this research was 1993 to 2002. The research clearly shows that stock prices tended to be at a low point on reported grant dates. The stock price on a reported grant date was on average lower than that on each of the 30 days before the grant date and lower than that on each of the 30 days after the grant date. Statistical tests carried out by the researchers showed that this could not have happened by chance. The research led regulators to conclude that backdating was occurring. In August 2002, the SEC required option grants by public companies to be reported within two business days. Heron and Lie showed that this led to a dramatic change in the stock price patterns around the grant date—particularly for those companies that complied with the SEC rule.[12] Reported grant dates were no longer low-stock-price dates. It might be argued that the patterns observed by Yermack and Lie can be explained by managers choosing grant dates after bad news or before good news, but Heron and Lie's research shows that, although there might been a tendency for this to happen, it is not the major explanation of the Yermack and Lie results.

Estimates of the number of companies that illegally backdated stock option grants in the United States vary widely. Tens and maybe hundreds of companies seem to have engaged in the practice. Many companies seem to have adopted the view that it was acceptable to backdate up to one month. Some CEOs resigned when their backdating practices came to light. In August 2007, Gregory Reyes of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., became the first CEO to be tried for backdating stock option grants. Allegedly, Mr. Reyes said to a human resources employee: "It is not illegal if you do not get caught." In June 2010, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined 15 million.

Companies involved in backdating have had to restate past financial statements and have been defendants in class action suits brought by shareholders who claim to have lost money as a result of backdating. For example, McAfee announced in December

2007 that it would restate earnings between 1995 and 2005 by  $137.4 million. In 2006, it set aside$ 13.8 million to cover lawsuits.

# SUMMARY

Until 2005, at-the-money stock option grants were a very attractive form of compensation. They had no impact on the income statement and were very valuable to employees. Accounting standards now require options to be expensed.

There are a number of different approaches to valuing employee stock options. A common approach is to use the Black-Scholes-Merton model with the life of the option set equal to the expected time to exercise or expiry of the option. Another approach is to assume that options are exercised as soon as the ratio of the stock price to the strike price reaches a certain barrier. A third approach is to try and estimate the relationship between the probability of exercise, the ratio of the stock price to the strike price, and the time to option maturity. A fourth approach is to create a market for securities that replicate the payoffs on the options.

Academic research has shown beyond doubt that many companies have engaged in the illegal practice of backdating stock option grants in order to reduce the strike price, while still contending that the options were at the money. The first prosecutions for this illegal practice were in 2007.

# CHAPTER

# Options on Stock Indices and Currencies

Options on stock indices and currencies were introduced in Chapter 10. This chapter discusses them in more detail. It explains how they work and reviews some of the ways they can be used. In the second half of the chapter, the valuation results in Chapter 15 are extended to cover European options on a stock paying a known dividend yield. It is then argued that both stock indices and currencies are analogous to stocks paying dividend yields. This enables the results for options on a stock paying a dividend yield to be applied to these types of options as well.

# 17.1 OPTIONS ON STOCK INDICES

Several exchanges trade options on stock indices. Some of the indices track the movement of the market as a whole. Others are based on the performance of a particular sector (e.g., computer technology, oil and gas, transportation, or telecoms). Among the index options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) are American and European options on the S&P 100 (OEX and XEO), European options on the S&P 500 (SPX), European options on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJX), and European options on the Nasdaq 100 (NDX). In Chapter 10, we explained that the CBOE trades LEAPS and flex options on individual stocks. It also offers these option products on indices.

One index option contract is usually on 100 times the index. (Note that the Dow Jones index used for index options is 0.01 times the usually quoted Dow Jones index.) Index options are settled in cash. This means that, on exercise of the option, the holder of a call option contract receives  $(S - K) \times 100$  in cash and the writer of the option pays this amount in cash, where  $S$  is the value of the index at the close of trading on the day of the exercise and  $K$  is the strike price. Similarly, the holder of a put option contract receives  $(K - S) \times 100$  in cash and the writer of the option pays this amount in cash.

# Portfolio Insurance

Portfolio managers can use options on a well-diversified index to limit their downside risk. Suppose that the value of the index today is  $S_0$ . Consider a manager in charge of a well-diversified portfolio whose beta is 1.0. A beta of 1.0 implies that the returns from the portfolio mirror those from the index. Assuming the dividend yield from the portfolio is the same as the dividend yield from the index, the percentage changes in the value of the portfolio can be expected to be approximately the same as the percentage changes in the value of the index. Since each contract is on 100 times the index, it follows that the value of the portfolio is protected against the possibility of the index falling below  $K$  if, for each  $100S_0$  dollars in the portfolio, the manager buys one put option contract with strike price  $K$ . Suppose that the manager's portfolio is worth  $\500,000$  and the value of the index is currently 1,000. The portfolio is worth 500 times the index. The manager can obtain insurance against the value of the portfolio dropping below  $\$ 450,000  in the next three months by buying five three-month put option contracts on the index with a strike price of 900.

To illustrate how the insurance works, consider the situation where the index drops to 880 in three months. The portfolio will be worth about $440,000. The payoff from the options will be 5 × (900 - 880) × 100 = $10,000, bringing the total value of the portfolio up to the insured value of 450,000.

# When the Portfolio's Beta Is Not 1.0

If the portfolio's beta  $(\beta)$  is not  $1.0, \beta$  put options must be purchased for each  $100S_{0}$  dollars in the portfolio, where  $S_{0}$  is the current value of the index. Suppose that the 500,000 portfolio just considered has a beta of 2.0 instead of 1.0. We continue to assume that the index is 1,000. The number of put options required is

$$
2. 0 \times \frac {5 0 0 , 0 0 0}{1 , 0 0 0 \times 1 0 0} = 1 0
$$ rather than 5 as before.


To calculate the appropriate strike price, the capital asset pricing model can be used (see the appendix to Chapter 3). Suppose that the risk free rate is  $12\%$ , the dividend yield on both the index and the portfolio is  $4\%$ , and protection is required against the value of the portfolio dropping below  $\$450,000$  in the next three months. Under the

Table 17.1 Calculation of expected value of portfolio when the index is 1,040 in three months and  $\beta = 2.0$ .

<table><tr><td>Value of index in three months:</td><td>1,040</td></tr><tr><td>Return from change in index:</td><td>40/1,000, or 4\% per three months</td></tr><tr><td>Dividends from index:</td><td>0.25 × 4 = 1\% per three months</td></tr><tr><td>Total return from index:</td><td>4 + 1 = 5\% per three months</td></tr><tr><td>Risk-free interest rate:</td><td>0.25 × 12 = 3\% per three months</td></tr><tr><td>Excess return from index over risk-free interest rate:</td><td>5 - 3 = 2\% per three months</td></tr><tr><td>Expected excess return from portfolio

Table 17.2 Relationship between value of index and value of portfolio for  $\beta = 2.0$

<table><tr><td>Value of index in three months</td><td>Value of portfolio in three months ($)</td></tr><tr><td>1,080</td><td>570,000</td></tr><tr><td>1,040</td><td>530,000</td></tr><tr><td>1,000</td><td>490,000</td></tr><tr><td>960</td><td>450,000</td></tr><tr><td>920</td><td>410,000</td></tr><tr><td>880</td><td>370,000</td></tr></table> capital asset pricing model, the expected excess return of a portfolio over the risk-free rate is assumed to equal beta times the excess return of the index portfolio over the risk-free rate. The model enables the expected value of the portfolio to be calculated for different values of the index at the end of three months. Table 17.1 shows the calculations for the case where the index is 1,040. In this case, the expected value of the portfolio at the end of the three months is  $530,000. Similar calculations can be carried out for other values of the index at the end of the three months. The results are shown in Table 17.2. The strike price for the options that are purchased should be the index level corresponding to the protection level required on the portfolio. In this case, the protection level is$ 450,000 and so the correct strike price for the 10 put option contracts that are purchased is 960. $^{1}$


To illustrate how the insurance works, consider what happens if the value of the index falls to 880. As shown in Table 17.2, the value of the portfolio is then about $370,000. The put options pay off (960 - 880) × 10 × 100 = $80,000, and this is exactly what is necessary to move the total value of the portfolio manager's position up from $370,000 to the required level of $450,000.

The examples in this section show that there are two reasons why the cost of hedging increases as the beta of a portfolio increases. More put options are required and they have a higher strike price.

# 17.2 CURRENCY OPTIONS

Currency options are primarily traded in the over-the-counter market. The advantage of this market is that large trades are possible, with strike prices, expiration dates, and other features tailored to meet the needs of corporate treasurers. Although currency options do trade on NASDAQ OMX in the United States, the exchange-traded market for these options is much smaller than the over-the-counter market.

An example of a European call option is a contract that gives the holder the right to buy one million euros with U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of 1.1000 U.S. dollars per euro. If the actual exchange rate at the maturity of the option is 1.1500, the payoff is

1,000,000 \times (1.1500 - 1.1000) = \50,000. Similarly, an example of a European put option is a contract that gives the holder the right to sell ten million Australian dollars for U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of 0.7000 U.S. dollars per Australian dollar. If the actual exchange rate at the maturity of the option is 0.6700, the payoff is 10,000,000 \times (0.7000 - 0.6700) = \300,000.

For a corporation wishing to hedge a foreign exchange exposure, foreign currency options are an alternative to forward contracts. A U.S. company due to receive sterling at a known time in the future can hedge its risk by buying put options on sterling that mature at that time. The hedging strategy guarantees that the exchange rate applicable to the sterling will not be less than the strike price, while allowing the company to benefit from any favorable exchange-rate movements. Similarly, a U.S. company due to pay sterling at a known time in the future can hedge by buying calls on sterling that mature at that time. This hedging strategy guarantees that the cost of the sterling will not be greater than a certain amount while allowing the company to benefit from favorable exchange-rate movements. Whereas a forward contract locks in the exchange rate for a future transaction, an option provides a type of insurance. This is not free. It costs nothing to enter into a forward transaction, but options require a premium to be paid up front.

# Range Forwards

A range forward contract is a variation on a standard forward contract for hedging foreign exchange risk. Consider a U.S. company that knows it will receive one million pounds sterling in three months. Suppose that the three-month forward exchange rate is 1.3200 dollars per pound. The company could lock in this exchange rate for the dollars it receives by entering into a short forward contract to sell one million pounds sterling in three months. This would ensure that the amount received for the one million pounds is 1,320,000.

An alternative is to buy a European put option with a strike price of  $K_{1}$  and sell a European call option with a strike price  $K_{2}$ , where  $K_{1} < 1.3200 < K_{2}$ . This is known as a short position in a range forward contract. The payoff is shown in Figure 17.1a. Both options are on one million pounds. If the exchange rate in three months proves to be less than  $K_{1}$ , the put option is exercised and as a result the company is able to sell the

If the company knew it was due to pay rather than receive one million pounds in three months, it could sell a European put option with strike price  $K_{1}$  and buy a European call option with strike price  $K_{2}$ . This is a long position in a range forward contract and the payoff is shown in Figure 17.1b. If the exchange rate in three months proves to be less than  $K_{1}$ , the put option is exercised against the company and as a result the company buys the one million pounds it needs at an exchange rate of  $K_{1}$ . If the exchange rate is between  $K_{1}$  and  $K_{2}$ , neither option is exercised and the company buys the one million pounds at the current exchange rate. If the exchange rate is greater than  $K_{2}$ , the call option is exercised and the company is able to buy the one million pounds at an exchange rate of  $K_{2}$ . The exchange rate paid for the one million pounds is the same as that received for the one million pounds in the earlier example and is shown in Figure 17.2.

In practice, a range forward contract is set up so that the price of the put option equals the price of the call option. This means that it costs nothing to set up the range forward contract, just as it costs nothing to set up a regular forward contract. Suppose that the U.S. and British interest rates are both  $2\%$ , so that the spot exchange rate is 1.3200 (the same as the forward exchange rate). Suppose further that the exchange rate volatility is  $14\%$ . We can use DerivaGem to show that a European put with strike price 1.3000 to sell one pound has the same price as a European call option with a strike price of 1.3414 to buy one pound. (Both are worth 0.0273.) Setting  $K_{1} = 1.3000$  and  $K_{2} = 1.3414$  therefore leads to a contract with zero cost in our example.

As the strike prices of the call and put options in a range forward contract are moved together, the range forward contract becomes a regular forward contract. The (short) range forward contract in Figure 17.1a becomes a short forward contract and the (long) range forward contract in Figure 17.1b becomes a long forward contract.

# 17.3 OPTIONS ON STOCKS PAYING KNOWN DIVIDEND YIELDS

In this section we produce a simple rule that enables valuation results for European options on a non-dividend-paying stock to be extended so that they apply to European options on a stock paying a known dividend yield. Later we show how this enables us to value options on stock indices and currencies.

Suppose that the dividend yield per year (measured with continuous compounding) is  $q$ . Dividends cause stock prices to reduce on the ex-dividend date by the amount of the dividend payment. The payment of a dividend yield at rate  $q$  therefore causes the growth rate in the stock price to be less than it would otherwise be by an amount  $q$ . If, with a dividend yield of  $q$ , the stock price grows from  $S_0$  today to  $S_T$  at time  $T$ , then in the absence of dividends it would grow from  $S_0$  today to  $S_T e^{qT}$  at time  $T$ . Alternatively, in the absence of dividends it would grow from  $S_0 e^{-qT}$  today to  $S_T$  at time  $T$ .

This argument shows that we get the same probability distribution for the stock price at time  $T$  in each of the following two cases:

1. The stock starts at price  $S_0$  and provides a dividend yield at rate  $q$ .
2. The stock starts at price  $S_0e^{-qT}$  and pays no dividends.

This leads to a simple rule. When valuing a European option lasting for time  $T$  on a stock paying a known dividend yield at rate  $q$ , we reduce the current stock price from  $S_0$  to  $S_0e^{-q\tilde{T}}$  and then value the option as though the stock pays no dividends.2

# Lower Bounds for Option Prices

As a first application of this rule, consider the problem of determining bounds for the price of a European option on a stock paying a dividend yield at rate  $q$ . Substituting  $S_0e^{-qT}$  for  $S_0$  in equation (11.4), we see that a lower bound for the European call option price,  $c$ , is given by

$$ c \geq \max  \left(S _ {0} e ^ {- q T} - K e ^ {- r T}, 0\right) \tag {17.1}
$$

We can also prove this directly by considering the following two portfolios:

Portfolio  $A$ : one European call option plus an amount of cash equal to  $Ke^{-rT}$

Portfolio B:  $e^{-qT}$  shares with dividends being reinvested in additional shares.

To obtain a lower bound for a European put option, we can similarly replace  $S_0$  by  $S_0 e^{-qT}$  in equation (11.5) to get

$$ p \geq \max  \left(K e ^ {- r T} - S _ {0} e ^ {- q T}, 0\right) \tag {17.2}
$$

This result can also be proved directly by considering the following portfolios:

Portfolio C: one European put option plus  $e^{-qT}$  shares with dividends on the shares being reinvested in additional shares

Portfolio  $D$ : an amount of cash equal to  $Ke^{-rT}$ .

# Put-Call Parity

Replacing  $S_0$  by  $S_0e^{-qT}$  in equation (11.6) we obtain put-call parity for an option on a stock paying a dividend yield at rate  $q$ :

$$ c + K e ^ {- r T} = p + S _ {0} e ^ {- q T} \tag {17.3}
$$

This result can also be proved directly by considering the following two portfolios:

Portfolio A: one European call option plus an amount of cash equal to  $Ke^{-rT}$

Portfolio C: one European put option plus  $e^{-qT}$  shares with dividends on the shares being reinvested in additional shares.

Both portfolios are both worth  $\max(S_T, K)$  at time  $T$ . They must therefore be worth the same today, and the put-call parity result in equation (17.3) follows. For American options, the put-call parity relationship is (see Problem 17.16)

$$
S _ {0} e ^ {- q T} - K \leq C - P \leq S _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T}
$$

# Pricing Formulas

By replacing  $S_0$  by  $S_0e^{-qT}$  in the Black-Scholes-Merton formulas, equations (15.20) and (15.21), we obtain the price,  $c$ , of a European call and the price,  $p$ , of a European put on a stock paying a dividend yield at rate  $q$  as

$$ c = S _ {0} e ^ {- q T} N \left(d _ {1}\right) - K e ^ {- r T} N \left(d _ {2}\right) \tag {17.4}
$$

$$ p = K e ^ {- r T} N (- d _ {2}) - S _ {0} e ^ {- q T} N (- d _ {1}) \tag {17.5}
$$

Since

$$
\ln \frac {S _ {0} e ^ {- q T}}{K} = \ln \frac {S _ {0}}{K} - q T
$$ it follows that  $d_{1}$  and  $d_{2}$  are given by


$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (S _ {0} / K) + (r - q + \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}
$$

$$ d _ {2} = \frac {\ln (S _ {0} / K) + (r - q - \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}} = d _ {1} - \sigma \sqrt {T}
$$

These results were first derived by Merton. As discussed in Chapter 15, the word dividend should, for the purposes of option valuation, be defined as the reduction in the stock price on the ex-dividend date arising from any dividends declared. If the dividend yield rate is known but not constant during the life of the option, equations (17.4) and (17.5) are still true, with  $q$  equal to the average annualized dividend yield during the option's life.

# Differential Equation and Risk-Neutral Valuation

To prove the results in equations (17.4) and (17.5) more formally, we can either solve the differential equation that the option price must satisfy or use risk-neutral valuation.

When we include a dividend yield of  $q$  in the analysis in Section 15.6, the differential equation (15.16) becomes

$$
\frac {\partial f}{\partial t} + (r - q) S \frac {\partial f}{\partial S} + \frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {2} S ^ {2} \frac {\partial^ {2} f}{\partial S ^ {2}} = r f \tag {17.6}
$$

Like equation (15.16), this does not involve any variable affected by risk preferences. Therefore the risk-neutral valuation procedure described in Section 15.7 can be used.

In a risk-neutral world, the total return from the stock must be  $r$ . The dividends provide a return of  $q$ . The expected growth rate in the stock price must therefore be  $r - q$ . It follows that the risk-neutral process for the stock price is

$$ d S = (r - q) S d t + \sigma S d z \tag {17.7}
$$

To value a derivative dependent on a stock that provides a dividend yield equal to  $q$ , we set the expected growth rate of the stock equal to  $r - q$  and discount the expected payoff at rate  $r$ . When the expected growth rate in the stock price is  $r - q$ , the expected stock price at time  $T$  is  $S_0 e^{(r - q)T}$ . A similar analysis to that in the appendix to Chapter 15 gives the expected payoff for a call option in a risk-neutral world as

$$ e ^ {(r - q) T} S _ {0} N (d _ {1}) - K N (d _ {2})
$$ where  $d_{1}$  and  $d_{2}$  are defined as above. Discounting at rate  $r$  for time  $T$  leads to equation (17.4).


# 17.4 VALUATION OF EUROPEAN STOCK INDEX OPTIONS

In valuing index futures in Chapter 5, we assumed that the index could be treated as an asset paying a known yield. In valuing index options, we make similar assumptions. This means that equations (17.1) and (17.2) provide a lower bound for European index options; equation (17.3) is the put-call parity result for European index options; equations (17.4) and (17.5) can be used to value European options on an index; and the binomial tree approach can be used for American options. In all cases,  $S_0$  is equal to the current value of the index,  $\sigma$  is equal to the volatility of the index, and  $q$  is equal to the average annualized dividend yield on the index during the life of the option expressed with continuous compounding.

# Example 17.1

Consider a European call option on an index that is two months from maturity. The current value of the index is 930, the exercise price is 900, the risk-free interest rate is

8\% per annum, and the volatility of the index is 20\% per annum. Dividend yields of 0.2\% and 0.3\% (expressed with continuous compounding) are expected in the first month and the second month, respectively. In this case  $S_0 = 930$ ,  $K = 900$ ,  $r = 0.08$ ,  $\sigma = 0.2$ , and  $T = 2/12$ . The total dividend yield during the option's life is 0.2\% + 0.3\% = 0.5\%. This corresponds to 3\% per annum. Hence,  $q = 0.03$  and

$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (9 3 0 / 9 0 0) + (0 . 0 8 - 0 . 0 3 + 0 . 2 ^ {2} / 2) \times 2 / 1 2}{0 . 2 \sqrt {2 / 1 2}} = 0. 5 4 4 4
$$

$$ d _ {2} = \frac {\ln (9 3 0 / 9 0 0) + (0 . 0 8 - 0 . 0 3 - 0 . 2 ^ {2} / 2) \times 2 / 1 2}{0 . 2 \sqrt {2 / 1 2}} = 0. 4 6 2 8
$$

$$
N \left(d _ {1}\right) = 0. 7 0 6 9, \quad N \left(d _ {2}\right) = 0. 6 7 8 2
$$ so that the call price,  $c$ , is given by equation (17.4) as


$$ c = 9 3 0 \times 0. 7 0 6 9 e ^ {- 0. 0 3 \times 2 / 1 2} - 9 0 0 \times 0. 6 7 8 2 e ^ {- 0. 0 8 \times 2 / 1 2} = 5 1. 8 3
$$

One contract, if on 100 times the index, would cost 5,183.

The calculation of  $q$  should include only dividends for which the ex-dividend dates occur during the life of the option. In the United States ex-dividend dates tend to occur during the first week of February, May, August, and November. At any given time the correct value of  $q$  is therefore likely to depend on the life of the option. This is even more true for indices in other countries. In Japan, for example, all companies tend to use the same ex-dividend dates.

If the absolute amount of the dividend that will be paid on the stocks underlying the index (rather than the dividend yield) is assumed to be known, the basic Black-Scholes-Merton formulas can be used with the initial stock price being reduced by the present value of the dividends. This is the approach recommended in Chapter 15 for a stock paying known dividends. However, it may be difficult to implement for a broadly based stock index because it requires a knowledge of the dividends expected on every stock underlying the index.

It is sometimes argued that, in the long run, the return from investing a certain amount of money in a well-diversified stock portfolio is almost certain to beat the return from investing the same amount of money in a bond portfolio. If this were so, a long-dated put option allowing the stock portfolio to be sold for the value of the bond portfolio should not cost very much. In fact, as indicated by Business Snapshot 17.1, it is quite expensive.

# Forward Prices and the Estimation of Dividend Yields

Define  $F_0$  as the forward price of the index for a contract with maturity  $T$ . As shown by equation (5.3),  $F_0 = S_0 e^{(r - q)T}$ . This means that the equations for the European call price  $c$  and the European put price  $p$  in equations (17.4) and (17.5) can be written

$$ c = F _ {0} e ^ {- r T} N \left(d _ {1}\right) - K e ^ {- r T} N \left(d _ {2}\right) \tag {17.8}
$$

$$ p = K e ^ {- r T} N \left(- d _ {2}\right) - F _ {0} e ^ {- r T} N \left(- d _ {1}\right) \tag {17.9}
$$ where


$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln \left(F _ {0} / K\right) + \sigma^ {2} T / 2}{\sigma \sqrt {T}} \quad \text {a n d} \quad d _ {2} = \frac {\ln \left(F _ {0} / K\right) - \sigma^ {2} T / 2}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}
$$

# Business Snapshot 17.1 Can We Guarantee that Stocks Will Beat Bonds in the Long Run?

It is often said that if you are a long-term investor you should buy stocks rather than bonds. Consider a U.S. fund manager who is trying to persuade investors to buy, as a long-term investment, an equity fund that is expected to mirror the S&P 500. The manager might be tempted to offer purchasers of the fund a guarantee that their return will be at least as good as the return on risk-free bonds over the next 10 years. Historically stocks have outperformed bonds in the United States over almost any 10-year period. It appears that the fund manager would not be giving much away.

In fact, this type of guarantee is surprisingly expensive. Suppose that an equity index is 1,000 today, the dividend yield on the index is  $1\%$  per annum, the volatility of the index is  $15\%$  per annum, and the 10-year risk-free rate is  $5\%$  per annum. To outperform bonds, the stocks underlying the index must earn more than  $5\%$  per annum. The dividend yield will provide  $1\%$  per annum. The capital gains on the stocks must therefore provide  $4\%$  per annum. This means that we require the index level to be at least  $1,000e^{0.04 \times 10} = 1,492$  in 10 years.

A guarantee that the return on  $1,000 invested in the index will be greater than the return on$ 1,000 invested in bonds over the next 10 years is therefore equivalent to the right to sell the index for 1,492 in 10 years. This is a European put option on the index and can be valued from equation (17.5) with  $S_0 = 1,000$ ,  $K = 1,492$ ,  $r = 5\%$ ,  $\sigma = 15\%$ ,  $T = 10$ , and  $q = 1\%$ . The value of the put option is 169.7. This shows that the guarantee contemplated by the fund manager is worth about 17\% of the fund—hardly something that should be given away!

The put-call parity relationship in equation (17.3) can be written

$$
\begin{array}{l} c + K e ^ {- r T} = p + F _ {0} e ^ {- r T} \\ F _ {0} = K + (c - p) e ^ {r T} \end{array} \tag {17.10}
$$

Working with forward prices and equations (17.8) and (17.9) is attractive because it avoids the need to estimate the dividend yield on the index directly. The dividend yield expected by the market is incorporated into forward prices. Futures prices for stock indices can be assumed to be the same as forward prices and so futures markets can be used to estimate forward prices for the maturities of the futures contracts that trade. If, as is not uncommon, European put and call options with the same strike price and maturity date are traded, equation (17.10) can be used to provide an estimate of the forward price of the index for that maturity date.

Once forward prices for a number of different maturity dates have been obtained (at least approximately), a smooth function describing the forward price as a function of maturity can be estimated, and equations (17.8) and (17.9) can be used to determine the prices of European index options for a range of maturities.

When American options on an index are valued, the average dividend yield during the life of the option must be estimated explicitly. Because  $F_0 = S_0 e^{(r - q)T}$ , the average dividend yield during the life of a futures contract can be estimated as

$$ q = r - \frac {1}{T} \ln \frac {F _ {0}}{S _ {0}}
$$

A European call and put option with the same strike price and maturity date can also be used to estimate  $q$ . From equation (17.3),

$$ q = - \frac {1}{T} \ln \frac {c - p + K e ^ {- r T}}{S _ {0}}
$$

For a particular strike price and time to maturity, the estimates of  $q$  calculated from this equation are liable to be unreliable. But when the results from many matched pairs of calls and puts are combined, a clearer picture of the term structure of dividend yields being assumed by the market emerges.

# 17.5 VALUATION OF EUROPEAN CURRENCY OPTIONS

To value currency options, we define  $S_0$  as the spot exchange rate. To be precise,  $S_0$  is the value of one unit of the foreign currency in U.S. dollars. As explained in Section 5.10, a foreign currency is analogous to a stock paying a known dividend yield. The owner of foreign currency receives a yield equal to the risk-free interest rate,  $r_f$ , in the foreign currency. Equations (17.1) and (17.2), with  $q$  replaced by  $r_f$ , provide bounds for the European call price,  $c$ , and the European put price,  $p$ :

$$ c \geq \max  \left(S _ {0} e ^ {- r _ {f} T} - K e ^ {- r T}, 0\right) \quad \text {a n d} \quad p \geq \max  \left(K e ^ {- r T} - S _ {0} e ^ {- r _ {f} T}, 0\right)
$$

Equation (17.3), with  $q$  replaced by  $r_f$ , provides the put-call parity result for European currency options:

$$ c + K e ^ {- r T} = p + S _ {0} e ^ {- r _ {f} T}
$$

Finally, equations (17.4) and (17.5) provide the pricing formulas for European currency options when  $q$  is replaced by  $r_f$ :

$$ c = S _ {0} e ^ {- r f T} N \left(d _ {1}\right) - K e ^ {- r T} N \left(d _ {2}\right) \tag {17.11}
$$

$$ p = K e ^ {- r T} N \left(- d _ {2}\right) - S _ {0} e ^ {- r _ {f} T} N \left(- d _ {1}\right) \tag {17.12}
$$ where


$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (S _ {0} / K) + (r - r _ {f} + \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}
$$

$$ d _ {2} = \frac {\ln (S _ {0} / K) + (r - r _ {f} - \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}} = d _ {1} - \sigma \sqrt {T}
$$

Both the domestic interest rate,  $r$ , and the foreign interest rate,  $r_f$ , are the rates for a maturity  $T$ .

# Example 17.2

Consider a 4-month European call option on the British pound. Suppose that the current exchange rate is 1.6000, the exercise price is 1.6000, the risk-free interest rate in the United States is  $8\%$  per annum, the risk-free interest rate in Britain is  $11\%$  per annum, and the option price is 4.3 cents. In this case,  $S_0 = 1.6$ ,  $K = 1.6$ ,  $r = 0.08$ ,  $r_f = 0.11$ ,  $T = 0.3333$ , and  $c = 0.043$ . The implied volatility can be calculated by trial and error. A volatility of  $20\%$  gives an option price of 0.0639; a volatility of  $10\%$  gives an option price of 0.0285; and so on. The implied volatility is  $14.1\%$ .

Put and call options on a currency are symmetrical in that a put option to sell one unit of currency A for currency B at strike price  $K$  is the same as a call option to buy  $K$  units of B with currency A at strike price  $1 / K$  (see Problem 17.12).

# Using Forward Exchange Rates

Because banks and other financial institutions trade forward contracts on foreign exchange rates actively, forward exchange rates are often used for valuing options. From equation (5.9), the forward exchange rate,  $F_{0}$ , for a maturity  $T$  is given by

$$
F _ {0} = S _ {0} e ^ {(r - r _ {f}) T}
$$

This relationship allows equations (17.11) and (17.12) to be simplified to

$$ c = e ^ {- r T} \left[ F _ {0} N \left(d _ {1}\right) - K N \left(d _ {2}\right) \right] \tag {17.13}
$$

$$ p = e ^ {- r T} \left[ K N \left(- d _ {2}\right) - F _ {0} N \left(- d _ {1}\right) \right] \tag {17.14}
$$ where


$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (F _ {0} / K) + \sigma^ {2} T / 2}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}
$$

$$ d _ {2} = \frac {\ln (F _ {0} / K) - \sigma^ {2} T / 2}{\sigma \sqrt {T}} = d _ {1} - \sigma \sqrt {T}
$$

Equations (17.13) and (17.14) are the same as equations (17.8) and (17.9). As we shall see in Chapter 18, a European option on the spot price of any asset can be valued in terms of the price of a forward or futures contract on the asset using equations (17.13) and (17.14). The maturity of the forward or futures contract must be the same as the maturity of the European option.

# 17.6 AMERICAN OPTIONS

As described in Chapter 13, binomial trees can be used to value American options on indices and currencies. As in the case of American options on a non-dividend-paying stock, the parameter determining the size of up movements,  $u$ , is set equal to  $e^{\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}}$  where  $\sigma$  is the volatility and  $\Delta t$  is the length of time steps. The parameter determining the size of down movements,  $d$ , is set equal to  $1 / u$ , or  $e^{-\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}}$ . For a non-dividend-paying stock, the probability of an up movement is

$$ p = \frac {a - d}{u - d}
$$ where  $a = e^{r\Delta t}$ . For options on indices and currencies, the formula for  $p$  is the same, but  $a$  is defined differently. In the case of options on an index,


$$ a = e ^ {(r - q) \Delta t} \tag {17.15}
$$ where  $q$  is the dividend yield on the index. In the case of options on a currency,


$$ a = e ^ {(r - r _ {f}) \Delta t} \tag {17.16}
$$ where  $r_f$  is the foreign risk-free rate. Example 13.1 in Section 13.11 shows how a two-step tree can be constructed to value an option on an index. Example 13.2 shows how a three-step tree can be constructed to value an option on a currency. Further examples of the use of binomial trees to value options on indices and currencies are given in Chapter 21.


In some circumstances, it is optimal to exercise American currency and index options prior to maturity. Thus, American currency and index options are worth more than their European counterparts. In general, call options on high-interest currencies and put options on low-interest currencies are the most likely to be exercised early. The reason is that a high-interest currency is expected to depreciate and a low-interest currency is expected to appreciate. Similarly, call options on indices with high-dividend yields and put options on indices with low-dividend yields are most likely to be exercised early.

# SUMMARY

The index options trading on exchanges are settled in cash. On exercise of an index call option contract, the holder typically receives 100 times the amount by which the index exceeds the strike price. Similarly, on exercise of an index put option contract, the holder receives 100 times the amount by which the strike price exceeds the index. Index options can be used for portfolio insurance. If the value of the portfolio mirrors the index, it is appropriate to buy one put option contract for each  $100S_{0}$  dollars in the portfolio, where  $S_{0}$  is the value of the index. If the portfolio does not mirror the index,  $\beta$  put option contracts should be purchased for each  $100S_{0}$  dollars in the portfolio, where  $\beta$  is the beta of the portfolio from the capital asset pricing model. The strike price of the put options purchased should reflect the level of insurance required.

Most currency options are traded in the over-the-counter market. They can be used by corporate treasurers to hedge a foreign exchange exposure. For example, a U.S. corporate treasurer who knows that the company will be receiving sterling at a certain time in the future can hedge by buying put options that mature at that time. Similarly, a U.S. corporate treasurer who knows that the company will be paying sterling at a certain time in the future can hedge by buying call options that mature at that time. Currency options can also be used to create a range forward contract. This is a zero-cost contract that can be used to provide downside protection while giving up some of the upside for a company with a known foreign exchange exposure.

The Black-Scholes-Merton formula for valuing European options on a non-dividend-paying stock can be extended to cover European options on a stock paying a known dividend yield. The extension can be used to value European options on stock indices and currencies because:

1. A stock index is analogous to a stock paying a dividend yield. The dividend yield is the dividend yield on the stocks that make up the index.
2. A foreign currency is analogous to a stock paying a dividend yield. The foreign risk-free interest rate plays the role of the dividend yield.

Binomial trees can be used to value American options on stock indices and currencies.

# Futures Options and Black's Model

The options we have considered so far provide the holder with the right to buy or sell a certain asset by a certain date for a certain price. They are sometimes termed options on spot or spot options because, when the options are exercised, the sale or purchase of the asset at the agreed-on price takes place immediately. In this chapter we move on to consider options on futures, also known as futures options. In these contracts, exercise of the option gives the holder a position in a futures contract.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the U.S. authorized the trading of options on futures on an experimental basis in 1982. Permanent trading was approved in 1987, and since then the popularity of the contract has grown very fast.

In this chapter we consider how futures options work and the differences between these options and spot options. We examine how futures options can be priced, explore the relative pricing of futures options and spot options, and discuss what are known as futures-style options.

In 1976, Fischer Black proposed a model, now known as Black's model, for valuing European options on futures. As this chapter will show, the model has proved to be an important alternative to the Black-Scholes-Merton model for valuing a wide range of European spot options.

# 18.1 NATURE OF FUTURES OPTIONS

A futures option is the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a futures contract at a certain futures price by a certain date. Specifically, a futures call option is the right to enter into a long futures contract at a certain price; a futures put option is the right to enter into a short futures contract at a certain price. Futures options are generally American; that is, they can be exercised any time during the life of the contract.

If a futures call option is exercised, the holder acquires a long position in the underlying futures contract plus a cash amount equal to the most recent settlement futures price minus the strike price. If a futures put option is exercised, the holder acquires a short position in the underlying futures contract plus a cash amount equal to the strike price minus the most recent settlement futures price. As the following examples show, the effective payoff from a futures call option is  $\max (F - K,0)$  and the effective payoff from a futures put option is  $\max(K - F, 0)$ , where  $F$  is the futures price at the time of exercise and  $K$  is the strike price.

# Example 18.1

Suppose it is August 15 and a trader has one September futures call option contract on copper with a strike price of 320 cents per pound. One futures contract is on 25,000 pounds of copper. Suppose that the futures price of copper for delivery in September is currently 331 cents, and at the close of trading on August 14 (the last settlement) it was 330 cents. If the option is exercised, the trader receives a cash amount of

$$
2 5, 0 0 0 \times (3 3 0 - 3 2 0) \text {c e n t s} = \$ 2, 5 0 0
$$ plus a long position in a futures contract to buy 25,000 pounds of copper in September. If desired, the position in the futures contract can be closed out immediately. This would leave the trader with the 2,500 cash payoff plus an amount


$$

2 5, 0 0 0 \times (3 3 1 - 3 3 0) \text {c e n t s} = \$ 2 5 0

$$ reflecting the change in the futures price since the last settlement. The total payoff from exercising the option on August 15 is 2,750, which equals 25,000(F - K), where F is the futures price at the time of exercise and K is the strike price.


# Example 18.2

A trader has one December futures put option on corn with a strike price of 600 cents per bushel. One futures contract is on 5,000 bushels of corn. Suppose that the current futures price of corn for delivery in December is 580, and the most recent settlement price is 579 cents. If the option is exercised, the trader receives a cash amount of

$$

5, 0 0 0 \times (6 0 0 - 5 7 9) \text {c e n t s} = \$ 1, 0 5 0

$$ plus a short position in a futures contract to sell 5,000 bushels of corn in December. If desired, the position in the futures contract can be closed out. This would leave the trader with the 1,050 cash payoff minus an amount


$$

5, 0 0 0 \times (5 8 0 - 5 7 9) \text {c e n t s} = \$ 5 0

$$ reflecting the change in the futures price since the last settlement. The net payoff from exercise is 1,000, which equals 5,000(K - F), where F is the futures price at the time of exercise and K is the strike price.


# Expiration Months

Futures options are referred to by the delivery month of the underlying futures contract—not by the expiration month of the option. As mentioned earlier, most futures options are American. The expiration date of a futures option contract is usually a short period of time before the last trading day of the underlying futures contract. (For example, the CME Group Treasury bond futures option expires on the latest Friday that precedes by at least two business days the end of the month before the futures delivery month.) Exceptions are the CME Group mid-curve Eurodollar and the mid-curve three-month SOFR contracts where the futures contract expires much later than the options contract.

# Options on Interest Rate Futures

In Chapter 6, we discussed the interest rate futures contracts traded by the CME Group. Options on interest rate futures are also traded by the exchange. Consider, for example, the Treasury bond futures option contract. This is an option to enter into a Treasury bond futures contract. One Treasury bond futures contract is for the delivery of bonds with a principal of 100,000. The price of the Treasury bond futures option is quoted as a percentage of the face value of the underlying Treasury bonds to the nearest sixty-fourth of 1\%.

As explained in Chapter 6, the CME's most popular contract on short-term interest rates has traditionally been its Eurodollar futures contract. As LIBOR is phased out, the exchange expects this to be replaced by the three-month SOFR futures contract. Options on Eurodollar futures have been popular and are expected to be replaced by options on three-month SOFR futures, which were launched by the CME in January 2020. It will be recalled that the Eurodollar rate is a forward-looking rate (a borrowing rate for the next three months) whereas SOFR is a backward-looking rate (calculated by compounding overnight rates for the previous three months). Eurodollar and three-month SOFR futures are designed so that a one-basis-point move in the futures price is worth 25 per contract. The same is true of options on these futures contracts.

Interest rate futures option contracts work in the same way as the other futures options contracts discussed in this chapter. For example, in addition to the cash payoff, the holder of a call option obtains a long position in the futures contract when the option is exercised and the option writer obtains a corresponding short position. The total payoff from the call, including the value of the futures position, is  $\max (F - K,0)$ , where  $F$  is the futures price at the time of exercise and  $K$  is the strike price.

Interest rate futures prices increase when bond prices increase (i.e., when interest rates fall). They decrease when bond prices decrease (i.e., when interest rates rise). An investor who thinks that short-term interest rates will rise can speculate by buying put options on Eurodollar or SOFR futures, whereas an investor who thinks the rates will fall can speculate by buying call options on Eurodollar or SOFR futures. An investor who thinks that long-term interest rates will rise can speculate by buying put options on Treasury note futures or Treasury bond futures, whereas an investor who thinks the rates will fall can speculate by buying call options on these instruments.

# Example 18.3

Suppose that the June SOFR futures is 99.35 (indicating an interest rate of  $0.65\%$  per annum) and that an investor expects short-term interest rates to decline so that overnight rates between June and September are less than  $0.5\%$  per annum. Suppose also that the price of a call option with a strike price of 99.50 is 0.05 (i.e., 5 basis points). The investor could buy a call option contract with a strike price of 99.50 for  $\$25 \times 5$ , or  $\$125$ . If the investor exercises the call when the futures price is 99.70 (indicating an interest rate of  $0.3\%$  per annum), the payoff to the investor is  $\$25 \times 20$ , or  $\$500$ , and the investor's profit is  $\$375$ .

# Example 18.4

It is August and the futures price for the December Treasury bond contract is 96.09 (or  $96\frac{9}{32} = 96.28125$ ). The yield on long-term government bonds is about  $6.4\%$  per annum. An investor who feels that this yield will fall by December might choose to buy December calls with a strike price of 98. Assume that the price of these calls is 1-04 (or  $1\frac{4}{64} = 1.0625\%$  of the principal). If long-term rates fall to  $6\%$  per annum and the Treasury bond futures price rises to 100-00, the investor will make a net profit per 100 of bond futures of


$$

1 0 0. 0 0 - 9 8. 0 0 - 1. 0 6 2 5 = 0. 9 3 7 5

$$

Since one option contract is for the purchase or sale of instruments with a face value of $100,000, the investor's profit is $937.50 per option contract bought.

# 18.2 REASONS FOR THE POPULARITY OF FUTURES OPTIONS

It is natural to ask why people choose to trade options on futures rather than options on the underlying asset. The main reason appears to be that a futures contract is, in many circumstances, more liquid and easier to trade than the underlying asset. Furthermore, a futures price is known immediately from trading on the futures exchange, whereas the spot price of the underlying asset may not be so readily available.

Consider Treasury bonds. The market for Treasury bond futures is much more active than the market for any particular Treasury bond. Also, a Treasury bond futures price is known immediately from exchange trading. By contrast, the current market price of a bond can be obtained only by contacting one or more dealers. It is not surprising that investors would rather take delivery of a Treasury bond futures contract than Treasury bonds.

Futures on commodities are also often easier to trade than the commodities themselves. For example, it is much easier and more convenient to make or take delivery of a live-cattle futures contract than it is to make or take delivery of the cattle.

An important point about a futures option is that exercising it does not usually lead to delivery of the underlying asset, as in most circumstances the underlying futures contract is closed out prior to delivery. Futures options are therefore normally eventually settled in cash. This is appealing to many investors, particularly those with limited capital who may find it difficult to come up with the funds to buy the underlying asset when an option on spot is exercised. Another advantage sometimes cited for futures options is that futures and futures options are traded on the same exchange. This facilitates hedging, arbitrage, and speculation. It also tends to make the markets more efficient. A final point is that futures options entail lower transaction costs than spot options in many situations.

# 18.3 EUROPEAN SPOT AND FUTURES OPTIONS

The payoff from a European call option with strike price  $K$  on the spot price of an asset is

$$

\max  \left(S _ {T} - K, 0\right)

$$ where  $S_{T}$  is the spot price at the option's maturity. The payoff from a European call option with the same strike price on the futures price of the asset is

$$
\max  (F _ {T} - K, 0)
$$ where  $F_{T}$  is the futures price at the option's maturity. If the futures contract matures at


the same time as the option, then  $F_{T} = S_{T}$  and the two options are equivalent. Similarly, a European futures put option is worth the same as its spot put option counterpart when the futures contract matures at the same time as the option.

Most of the futures options that trade are American-style. However, as we shall see, it is useful to study European futures options because the results that are obtained can be used to value the corresponding European spot options.

# 18.4 PUT-CALL PARITY

In Chapter 11, we derived a put-call parity relationship for European stock options. We now consider a similar argument to derive a put-call parity relationship for European futures options. Consider European futures call and put options, both with strike price  $K$  and time to expiration  $T$ . We can form two portfolios:

Portfolio A: a European futures call option plus an amount of cash equal to  $Ke^{-rT}$

Portfolio B: a European futures put option plus a long futures contract plus an amount of cash equal to  $F_0 e^{-rT}$ , where  $F_0$  is the futures price

In portfolio A, the cash can be invested at the risk-free rate,  $r$ , and grows to  $K$  at time  $T$ . Let  $F_{T}$  be the futures price at maturity of the option. If  $F_{T} > K$ , the call option in portfolio A is exercised and portfolio A is worth  $F_{T}$ . If  $F_{T} \leq K$ , the call is not exercised and portfolio A is worth  $K$ . The value of portfolio A at time  $T$  is therefore

$$

\max  (F _ {T}, K)

$$

In portfolio B, the cash can be invested at the risk-free rate to grow to  $F_0$  at time  $T$ . The put option provides a payoff of  $\max(K - F_T, 0)$ . The futures contract provides a payoff of  $F_T - F_0$ . The value of portfolio B at time  $T$  is therefore

$$

F _ {0} + \left(F _ {T} - F _ {0}\right) + \max  \left(K - F _ {T}, 0\right) = \max  \left(F _ {T}, K\right)

$$

Because the two portfolios have the same value at time  $T$  and European options cannot be exercised early, it follows that they are worth the same today. The value of portfolio A today is

$$ c + K e ^ {- r T}
$$ where  $c$  is the price of the futures call option. The daily settlement process ensures that the futures contract in portfolio B is worth zero today. Portfolio B is therefore worth


$$ p + F _ {0} e ^ {- r T}
$$ where  $p$  is the price of the futures put option. Hence


$$ c + K e ^ {- r T} = p + F _ {0} e ^ {- r T} \tag {18.1}
$$

The difference between this put-call parity relationship and the one for a non-dividend-paying stock in equation (11.6) is that the stock price,  $S_0$ , is replaced by the discounted futures price,  $F_0 e^{-rT}$ .

As shown in Section 18.3, when the underlying futures contract matures at the same time as the option, European futures and spot options are the same. Equation (18.1) therefore gives a relationship between the price of a call option on the spot price, the price of a put option on the spot price, and the futures price when both options mature at the same time as the futures contract.

# Example 18.5

Suppose that the price of a European call option on a commodity for delivery in six months is 0.56 per ounce when the strike price is 8.50. Assume that the futures price for delivery in six months is currently 8.00, and the risk-free interest rate for an investment that matures in six months is 10\% per annum. From a rearrangement of equation (18.1), the price of a European put option on the spot price with the same maturity and exercise date as the call option is

$$
0. 5 6 + 8. 5 0 e ^ {- 0. 1 \times 6 / 1 2} - 8. 0 0 e ^ {- 0. 1 \times 6 / 1 2} = 1. 0 4
$$

For American futures options, the put-call relationship is (see Problem 18.21)

$$
F _ {0} e ^ {- r T} - K <   C - P <   F _ {0} - K e ^ {- r T} \tag {18.2}
$$

# 18.5 BOUNDS FOR FUTURES OPTIONS

The put-call parity relationship in equation (18.1) provides bounds for European call and put options. Because the price of a put,  $p$ , cannot be negative, it follows from equation (18.1) that

$$ c + K e ^ {- r T} \geq F _ {0} e ^ {- r T}
$$ so that


$$ c \geq \max  \left(\left(F _ {0} - K\right) e ^ {- r T}, 0\right) \tag {18.3}
$$

Similarly, because the price of a call option cannot be negative, it follows from equation (18.1) that

$$
K e ^ {- r T} \leq F _ {0} e ^ {- r T} + p
$$ so that


$$ p \geq \max  \left(\left(K - F _ {0}\right) e ^ {- r T}, 0\right) \tag {18.4}
$$

These bounds are analogous to the ones derived for European stock options in Chapter 11. The prices of European call and put options are very close to their lower bounds when the options are deep in the money. To see why this is so, we return to the put-call parity relationship in equation (18.1). When a call option is deep in the money, a put option with the same strike price is deep out of the money. This means that  $p$  is very close to zero. The difference between  $c$  and its lower bound equals  $p$ , so that the price of the call option must be very close to its lower bound. A similar argument applies to put options.

Because American futures options can be exercised at any time, we must have

$$
C \geq \max  (F _ {0} - K, 0)
$$ and


$$

P \geq \max  (K - F _ {0}, 0)

$$

Thus, assuming interest rates are positive, the lower bound for an American option price is always higher than the lower bound for the corresponding European option price. There is always some chance that an American futures option will be exercised early.


# 18.6 DRIFT OF A FUTURES PRICE IN A RISK-NEUTRAL WORLD

There is a general result that allows us to use the analysis in Section 17.3 for futures options. This result is that in a risk-neutral world a futures price behaves in the same way as a stock paying a dividend yield at the domestic risk-free interest rate  $r$ .

One clue that this might be so is given by noting that the put-call parity relationship for futures options prices is the same as that for options on a stock paying a dividend yield at rate  $q$  when the stock price is replaced by the futures price and  $q = r$  (compare equations (18.1) and (17.3)).

To prove the result formally, we calculate the drift of a futures price in a risk-neutral world. We define  $F_{t}$  as the futures price at time  $t$  and suppose the settlement dates are at times 0,  $\Delta t$ ,  $2\Delta t$ , ... If we enter into a long futures contract at time 0, its value is zero. At time  $\Delta t$ , it provides a payoff of  $F_{\Delta t} - F_{0}$ . If  $r$  is the very-short-term ( $\Delta t$ -period) interest rate at time 0, risk-neutral valuation gives the value of the contract at time 0 as

$$ e ^ {- r \Delta t} \hat {E} \left[ F _ {\Delta t} - F _ {0} \right]
$$ where  $\hat{E}$  denotes expectations in a risk-neutral world. We must therefore have


$$ e ^ {- r \Delta t} \hat {E} \left(F _ {\Delta t} - F _ {0}\right) = 0
$$ showing that


$$

\hat {E} (F _ {\Delta t}) = F _ {0}

$$

Similarly,  $\hat{E}(F_{2\Delta t}) = F_{\Delta t}$ ,  $\hat{E}(F_{3\Delta t}) = F_{2\Delta t}$ , and so on. Putting many results like this together, we see that

$$

\hat {E} (F _ {T}) = F _ {0}

$$ for any time  $T$ .

The drift of the futures price in a risk-neutral world is therefore zero. From equation (17.7), the futures price behaves like a stock providing a dividend yield  $q$  equal to  $r$ . This result is a very general one. It is true for all futures prices and does not depend on any assumptions about interest rates, volatilities, etc.

The usual assumption made for the process followed by a futures price  $F$  in the risk-neutral world is

$$ d F = \sigma F d z \tag {18.5}
$$ where  $\sigma$  is a constant.


# Differential Equation

For another way of seeing that a futures price behaves like a stock paying a dividend yield at rate  $q$ , we can derive the differential equation satisfied by a derivative dependent on a futures price in the same way as we derived the differential equation for a derivative dependent on a non-dividend-paying stock in Section 15.6. This is


$$

\frac {\partial f}{\partial t} + \frac {1}{2} \frac {\partial^ {2} f}{\partial F ^ {2}} \sigma^ {2} F ^ {2} = r f \tag {18.6}

$$

It has the same form as equation (17.6) with  $q$  set equal to  $r$ . This confirms that, for the purpose of valuing derivatives, a futures price can be treated in the same way as a stock providing a dividend yield at rate  $r$ .

# 18.7 BLACK'S MODEL FOR VALUING FUTURES OPTIONS

European futures options can be valued by extending the results we have produced. Fischer Black was the first to show this in a paper published in 1976. Assuming that the futures price follows the (lognormal) process in equation (18.5), the European call price  $c$  and the European put price  $p$  for a futures option are given by equations (17.4) and (17.5) with  $S_0$  replaced by  $F_0$  and  $q = r$ :

$$ c = e ^ {- r T} \left[ F _ {0} N \left(d _ {1}\right) - K N \left(d _ {2}\right) \right] \tag {18.7}
$$

$$ p = e ^ {- r T} \left[ K N \left(- d _ {2}\right) - F _ {0} N \left(- d _ {1}\right) \right] \tag {18.8}
$$ where


$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (F _ {0} / K) + \sigma^ {2} T / 2}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}
$$

$$ d _ {2} = \frac {\ln (F _ {0} / K) - \sigma^ {2} T / 2}{\sigma \sqrt {T}} = d _ {1} - \sigma \sqrt {T}
$$ and  $\sigma$  is the volatility of the futures price. When the cost of carry and the convenience yield are functions only of time, it can be shown that the volatility of the futures price is the same as the volatility of the underlying asset.


# Example 18.6

Consider a European put futures option on a commodity. The time to the option's maturity is 4 months, the current futures price is  $20, the exercise price is$ 20, the risk-free interest rate is 9\% per annum, and the volatility of the futures price is 25\% per annum. In this case,  $F_0 = 20, K = 20, r = 0.09, T = 4/12, \sigma = 0.25$ , and  $\ln(F_0 / K) = 0$ , so that

$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\sigma \sqrt {T}}{2} = 0. 0 7 2 1 6
$$

$$ d _ {2} = - \frac {\sigma \sqrt {T}}{2} = - 0. 0 7 2 1 6
$$

$$
N (- d _ {1}) = 0. 4 7 1 2, \quad N (- d _ {2}) = 0. 5 2 8 8
$$
