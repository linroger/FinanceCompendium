In the last 40 years, derivatives have become increasingly important in finance. Futures and options are actively traded on many exchanges throughout the world. Many different types of forward contracts, swaps, options, and other derivatives are entered into by financial institutions, fund managers, and corporate treasurers in the over-the-counter market. Derivatives are added to bond issues, used in executive compensation plans, embedded in capital investment opportunities, used to transfer risks in mortgages from the original lenders to investors, and so on. We have now reached the stage where those who work in finance, and many who work outside finance, need to understand how derivatives work, how they are used, and how they are priced.

Whether you love derivatives or hate them, you cannot ignore them! The derivatives market is huge—much bigger than the stock market when measured in terms of underlying assets. The value of the assets underlying outstanding derivatives transactions is several times the world gross domestic product. As we shall see in this chapter, derivatives can be used for hedging or speculation or arbitrage. They can transfer a wide range of risks in the economy from one entity to another.

A derivative involves two parties agreeing to a future transaction. Its value depends on (or derives from) the values of other underlying variables. Very often the variables underlying derivatives are the prices of traded assets. A stock option, for example, is a derivative whose value is dependent on the price of a stock. However, derivatives can be dependent on almost any variable, from the price of hogs to the amount of snow falling at a certain ski resort.

Since the first edition of this book was published in 1988 there have been many developments in derivatives markets. For example:

- Many new instruments such as credit derivatives, electricity derivatives, weather derivatives, and insurance derivatives have been developed.
- Many new types of interest rate, foreign exchange, and equity derivatives now trade.
- There have been many new ideas in risk management and risk measurement.
Real option methods for capital investment appraisal have been developed.
- The financial crisis of 2008 occurred, with derivatives (perhaps unfairly) getting much of the blame.
- Many regulations affecting the over-the-counter derivatives market have been introduced.
- The "risk-free" discount rate used to value derivatives has changed and the decision has been taken to phase out LIBOR.
- Derivatives dealers now adjust the way they price derivatives to allow for credit risks, funding costs, and capital requirements.
- Collateral and credit issues are now given much more attention and have led to changes in the way derivatives are traded.
- Machine learning is now becoming widely used for managing derivatives portfolios.

The book has evolved to keep up to date with these developments. For example: the 2008 financial crisis is discussed in Chapter 8; changes in the interest rates used for derivatives pricing are discussed in Chapter 4; valuation adjustments are covered in Chapter 9; real options are explained in Chapter 36; credit derivatives are covered in Chapter 25; energy, weather, and insurance derivatives are covered in Chapter 35. Machine learning applications are discussed at various points in the book.

In this opening chapter, we take a first look at derivatives markets and how they are changing. We contrast exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives markets and review recent regulatory changes affecting the markets. We describe forward, futures, and options markets and provide examples of how they are used by hedgers, speculators, and arbitrageurs. Later in the book we will elaborate on many of the points made in this chapter.
