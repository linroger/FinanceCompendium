# 2.1 BACKGROUND

Examples of large futures exchanges are the CME Group (www.cmgroup.com), the Intercontinental Exchange (www.theice.com), Eurex (www.eurexchange.com), B3, Brazil (www.b3.com.br), the National Stock Exchange of India (www.nse-india .com), the China Financial Futures Exchange (www.cffex.com.cn), and the Tokyo Financial Exchange (www.tfx.co.jp). (See the table at the end of this book for a more complete list.)

We examine how a futures contract comes into existence by considering the corn futures contract traded by the CME Group. On June 5, a trader in New York might call a broker with instructions to buy 5,000 bushels of corn for delivery in September of the same year. The broker would immediately issue instructions to a trader to buy (i.e., take a long position in) one September corn contract. (Each corn contract is for the delivery of exactly 5,000 bushels.) At about the same time, another trader in Kansas might instruct a broker to sell 5,000 bushels of corn for September delivery. This broker would then issue instructions to sell (i.e., take a short position in) one corn contract. A price would be determined and the deal would be done. Under the traditional open outcry system, floor traders representing each party would physically meet to determine the price. With electronic trading, a computer matches the traders.

# Business Snapshot 2.1 The Unanticipated Delivery of a Futures Contract

This story (which may well be apocryphal) was told to the author of this book a long time ago by a senior executive of a financial institution. It concerns a new employee of the financial institution who had not previously worked in the financial sector. One of the clients of the financial institution regularly entered into a long futures contract on live cattle for hedging purposes and issued instructions to close out the position on the last day of trading. (Live cattle futures contracts are traded by the CME Group and each contract is on 40,000 pounds of cattle.) The new employee was given responsibility for handling the account.

When the time came to close out a contract the employee noted that the client was long one contract and instructed a trader at the exchange to buy (not sell) one contract. The result of this mistake was that the financial institution ended up with a long position in two live cattle futures contracts. By the time the mistake was spotted trading in the contract had ceased.

The financial institution (not the client) was responsible for the mistake. As a result, it started to look into the details of the delivery arrangements for live cattle futures contracts—something it had never done before. Under the terms of the contract, cattle could be delivered by the party with the short position to a number of different locations in the United States during the delivery month. Because it was long, the financial institution could do nothing but wait for a party with a short position to issue a notice of intention to deliver to the exchange and for the exchange to assign that notice to the financial institution.

It eventually received a notice from the exchange and found that it would receive live cattle at a location 2,000 miles away the following Tuesday. The new employee was sent to the location to handle things. It turned out that the location had a cattle auction every Tuesday. The party with the short position that was making delivery bought cattle at the auction and then immediately delivered them. Unfortunately the cattle could not be resold until the next cattle auction the following Tuesday. The employee was therefore faced with the problem of making arrangements for the cattle to be housed and fed for a week. This was a great start to a first job in the financial sector!

The trader in New York who agreed to buy has a long futures position in one contract; the trader in Kansas who agreed to sell has a short futures position in one contract. The price agreed to is the current futures price for September corn, say 600 cents per bushel. This price, like any other price, is determined by the laws of supply and demand. If, at a particular time, more traders wish to sell rather than buy September corn, the price will go down. New buyers then enter the market so that a balance between buyers and sellers is maintained. If more traders wish to buy rather than sell September corn, the price goes up. New sellers then enter the market and a balance between buyers and sellers is maintained.

# Closing Out Positions

The vast majority of futures contracts do not lead to delivery. The reason is that most traders choose to close out their positions prior to the delivery period specified in the contract. Closing out a position means entering into the opposite trade to the original one. For example, the New York trader who bought a September corn futures contract on June 5 can close out the position by selling (i.e., shorting) one September corn futures contract on, say, July 20. The Kansas trader who sold (i.e., shorted) a September contract on June 5 can close out the position by buying one September contract on, say, August 25. In each case, the trader's total gain or loss is determined by the change in the futures price between June 5 and the day when the contract is closed out.

Delivery is so unusual that traders sometimes forget how the delivery process works (see Business Snapshot 2.1). Nevertheless, we will review delivery procedures later in this chapter. This is because it is the possibility of final delivery that ties the futures price to the spot price.

# 2.2 SPECIFICATION OF A FUTURES CONTRACT

When developing a new contract, the exchange must specify in some detail the exact nature of the agreement between the two parties. In particular, it must specify the asset, the contract size (exactly how much of the asset will be delivered under one contract), where delivery can be made, and when delivery can be made.

Sometimes alternatives are specified for the grade of the asset that will be delivered or for the delivery locations. As a general rule, it is the party with the short position (the party that has agreed to sell the asset) that chooses what will happen when alternatives are specified by the exchange.2 When the party with the short position is ready to deliver, it files a notice of intention to deliver with the exchange. This notice indicates any selections it has made with respect to the grade of asset that will be delivered and the delivery location.

# The Asset

When the asset is a commodity, there may be quite a variation in the quality of what is available in the marketplace. When the asset is specified, it is therefore important that the exchange stipulate the grade or grades of the commodity that are acceptable. The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has specified the asset in its orange juice futures contract as frozen concentrates that are U.S. Grade A with Brix value of not less than 62.5 degrees.

For some commodities a range of grades can be delivered, but the price received depends on the grade chosen. For example, in the CME Group's corn futures contract, the standard grade is "No. 2 Yellow," but substitutions are allowed with the price being adjusted in a way established by the exchange. No. 1 Yellow is deliverable for 1.5 cents per bushel more than No. 2 Yellow. No. 3 Yellow is deliverable for 2 to 4 cents per bushel less than No. 2 Yellow depending on indicators of quality.

The financial assets in futures contracts are generally well defined and unambiguous. For example, there is no need to specify the grade of a Japanese yen. However, there are some interesting features of the Treasury bond and Treasury note futures contracts traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. For example, the underlying asset in the Treasury bond contract is any U.S. Treasury bond that has a maturity between 15 and 25 years; in the 10-year Treasury note futures contract, the underlying asset is any Treasury note with a maturity of between 6.5 and 10 years. The exchange has a formula for adjusting the price received according to the coupon and maturity date of the bond delivered. This is discussed in Chapter 6.

# The Contract Size

The contract size specifies the amount of the asset that has to be delivered under one contract. This is an important decision for the exchange. If the contract size is too large, many traders who wish to hedge relatively small exposures or who wish to take relatively small speculative positions will be unable to use the exchange. On the other hand, if the contract size is too small, trading may be expensive as there is a cost associated with each contract traded.

The correct size for a contract clearly depends on the likely user. Whereas the value of what is delivered under a futures contract on an agricultural product might be  $10,000 to$ 20,000, it is much higher for some financial futures. For example, under the Treasury bond futures contract traded by the CME Group, instruments with a face value of 100,000 are delivered.

In some cases exchanges have introduced "mini" contracts to attract smaller traders. For example, the CME Group's Mini Nasdaq 100 contract is on 20 times the Nasdaq 100 index, whereas the regular contract is on 100 times the index. (We will cover futures on indices more fully in Chapter 3.)

# Delivery Arrangements

The place where delivery will be made must be specified by the exchange. This is particularly important for commodities that involve significant transportation costs. In the case of the ICE frozen concentrate orange juice contract, delivery is to exchange-licensed warehouses in Florida, New Jersey, or Delaware.

When alternative delivery locations are specified, the price received by the party with the short position is sometimes adjusted according to the location chosen by that party. The price tends to be higher for delivery locations that are relatively far from the main sources of the commodity.

# Delivery Months

A futures contract is referred to by its delivery month. The exchange must specify the precise period during the month when delivery can be made. For many futures contracts, the delivery period is the whole month.

The delivery months vary from contract to contract and are chosen by the exchange to meet the needs of market participants. For example, corn futures traded by the CME Group have delivery months of March, May, July, September, and December. At any given time, contracts trade for the closest delivery month and a number of subsequent delivery months. The exchange specifies when trading in a particular month's contract will begin. The exchange also specifies the last day on which trading can take place for a given contract. Trading generally ceases a few days before the last day on which delivery can be made.

# Price Quotes

The exchange defines how prices will be quoted. For example, crude oil futures prices are quoted in dollars and cents. Treasury bond and Treasury note futures prices are quoted in dollars and thirty-seconds of a dollar.

# Price Limits and Position Limits

For most contracts, daily price movement limits are specified by the exchange. If in a day the price moves down from the previous day's close by an amount equal to the daily price limit, the contract is said to be limit down. If it moves up by the limit, it is said to be limit up. A limit move is a move in either direction equal to the daily price limit. Normally, trading ceases for the day once the contract is limit up or limit down. However, in some instances the exchange has the authority to step in and change the limits.

The purpose of daily price limits is to prevent large price movements from occurring because of speculative excesses. However, limits can become an artificial barrier to trading when the price of the underlying commodity is advancing or declining rapidly. Whether price limits are, on balance, good for futures markets is controversial.

Position limits are the maximum number of contracts that a speculator may hold. The purpose of these limits is to prevent speculators from exercising undue influence on the market.

# 2.3 CONVERGENCE OF FUTURES PRICE TO SPOT PRICE

As the delivery period for a futures contract is approached, the futures price converges to the spot price of the underlying asset. When the delivery period is reached, the futures price equals—or is very close to—the spot price.

To see why this is so, we first suppose that the futures price is above the spot price during the delivery period. Traders then have a clear arbitrage opportunity:

1. Sell (i.e., short) a futures contract
2. Buy the asset
3. Make delivery.

These steps are certain to lead to a profit equal to the amount by which the futures price exceeds the spot price. As traders exploit this arbitrage opportunity, the futures price will fall. Suppose next that the futures price is below the spot price during the delivery period. Companies interested in acquiring the asset will find it attractive to enter into a long futures contract and then wait for delivery to be made. As they do so, the futures price will tend to rise.

The result is that the futures price is very close to the spot price during the delivery period. Figure 2.1 illustrates the convergence of the futures price to the spot price. In Figure 2.1a the futures price is above the spot price prior to the delivery period. In

# 2.4 THE OPERATION OF MARGIN ACCOUNTS

If two traders get in touch with each other directly and agree to trade an asset in the future for a certain price, there are obvious risks. One of the traders may regret the deal and try to back out. Alternatively, the trader simply may not have the financial resources to honor the agreement. One of the key roles of the exchange is to organize trading so that contract defaults are avoided. This is where margin accounts come in.

# Daily Settlement

To illustrate how margin accounts work, we consider a trader who buys (i.e., takes a long position in) two December gold futures contracts. We suppose that the current futures price is  \$1,750 per ounce. Because the contract size is 100 ounces, the trader has contracted to buy a total of 200 ounces at this price. The trader has to keep funds in what is known as a margin account. The amount that must be deposited at the time the contract is entered into is known as the initial margin. We suppose this is\$ 6,000 per contract, or 12,000 in total. At the end of each trading day, the margin account is adjusted to reflect the trader's gain or loss. This practice is referred to as daily settlement or marking to market.

Suppose, for example, that by the end of the first day the futures price has dropped by \$9 from $1,750 to $1,741. The trader has a loss of $1,800 (= 200 × $9), because the 200 ounces of December gold, which the trader contracted to buy at \$1,750, can now be sold for only \$1,741. The balance in the margin account would therefore be reduced by $1,800 to $10,200. Similarly, if the price of December gold rose to \$1,759 by the end of the first day, the balance in the margin account would be increased by  $1,800 to$ 13,800. A trade is first settled at the close of the day on which it takes place. It is then settled at the close of trading on each subsequent day.

Daily settlement leads to funds flowing each day between traders with long positions and traders with short positions. If the futures price increases from one day to the next, funds flow from traders with short positions to traders with long positions. If the futures price decreases from one day to the next, funds flow in the opposite direction, from traders with short positions to traders with long positions. This daily flow of funds between traders to reflect gains and losses is known as variation margin.

Most individuals have to contact their brokers to trade. They are subject to what is termed a maintenance margin. This is somewhat lower than the initial margin. If the balance in the margin account falls below the maintenance margin, the trader receives a margin call and is expected to top up the margin account to the initial margin level within a short period of time. If the trader does not provide this variation margin, the broker closes out the position. In the case of the trader considered earlier, closing out the position would involve neutralizing the existing contract by selling 200 ounces of gold for delivery in December.

If the trader's contract increases in value, the balance in the margin account increases. The trader is entitled to withdraw any balance in the margin account that is in excess of the initial margin.

Table 2.1 Operation of margin account for a long position in two gold futures contracts. The initial margin is  \$6,000 per contract, or\$ 12,000 in total; the maintenance margin is  \$4,500 per contract, or\$ 9,000 in total. The contract is entered into on Day 1 at  \$1,750 and closed out on Day 16 at\$ 1,726.90.

Table 2.1 illustrates the operation of the margin account for one possible sequence of futures prices in the case of the trader considered earlier who buys two gold futures contracts. The maintenance margin is assumed to be  \$4,500 per contract, or\$ 9,000 in total. On Day 7, the balance in the margin account falls  \$1,020 below the maintenance margin level. This drop triggers a margin call from the broker for an additional\$ 4,020 to bring the account balance up to the initial margin level of \$12,000. It is assumed that the trader provides this margin by the close of trading on Day 8. On Day 11, the balance in the margin account again falls below the maintenance margin level, and a margin call for \$3,780 is sent out. The trader provides this margin by the close of trading on Day 12. On Day 16, the trader decides to close out the position by selling two contracts. The futures price on that day is  \$1,726.90, and the trader has a cumulative loss of\$ 4,620. Note that the trader has excess margin on Days 8, 13, 14, and 15. It is assumed that the excess is not withdrawn.

Most brokers pay traders interest on the balance in a margin account. The balance in the account does not, therefore, represent a true cost, provided that the interest rate is competitive with what could be earned elsewhere. To satisfy the initial margin requirements, but not subsequent margin calls, a trader can usually deposit securities with the broker. Treasury bills are usually accepted in lieu of cash at about  $90\%$  of their market value. Shares are also sometimes accepted in lieu of cash, but at about  $50\%$  of their market value.

Whereas a forward contract is settled at the end of its life, a futures contract is, as we have seen, settled daily. At the end of each day, the trader's gain (loss) is added to (subtracted from) the margin account, bringing the value of the contract back to zero. A futures contract is in effect closed out and rewritten at a new price each day.

Minimum levels for the initial and maintenance margin are set by the exchange clearing house. Individual brokers may require greater margins from their clients than the minimum levels specified by the exchange clearing house. Minimum margin levels are determined by the variability of the price of the underlying asset and are revised when necessary. The higher the variability, the higher the margin levels. The maintenance margin is usually about  $75\%$  of the initial margin.

Note that margin requirements are the same on short futures positions as they are on long futures positions. It is just as easy to take a short futures position as it is to take a long one. The spot market does not have this symmetry. Taking a long position in the spot market involves buying the asset for immediate delivery and presents no problems. Taking a short position involves selling an asset that you do not own. This is a more complex transaction that may or may not be possible in a particular market. It is discussed further in Chapter 5.

# The Clearing House and Its Members

A clearing house acts as an intermediary in futures transactions. It guarantees the performance of the parties to each transaction. The clearing house has a number of members. Brokers who are not members themselves must channel their business through a member and post margin with the member. The main task of the clearing house is to keep track of all the transactions that take place during a day, so that it can calculate the net position of each of its members.

The clearing house member is required to provide to the clearing house initial margin (sometimes referred to as clearing margin) reflecting the total number of contracts that are being cleared. The maintenance margin is set equal to the initial margin. At the end of each day, the transactions being handled by the clearing house member are settled through the clearing house. If in total the transactions have lost money, the member is required to provide variation margin to the exchange clearing house equal to the loss; if there has been a gain on the transactions, the member receives variation margin from the clearing house equal to the gain. Intraday variation margin payments may also be required by a clearing house from its members in times of significant price volatility; if margin requirements are not met, a member is closed out.

In determining margin requirements, the number of contracts outstanding is usually calculated on a net basis rather than a gross basis. This means that short positions the clearing house member is handling for clients are netted against long positions. Suppose, for example, that the clearing house member has two clients: one with a long position in 20 contracts, the other with a short position in 15 contracts. The initial margin would be calculated on the basis of five contracts. The calculation of the margin requirement is usually designed to ensure that the clearing house is about  $99\%$  certain that the margin will be sufficient to cover any losses in the event that the member defaults and has to be closed out. Clearing house members are required to contribute to a guaranty fund. This may be used by the clearing house in the event that a member defaults and the member's margin proves insufficient to cover losses.

# Credit Risk

The whole purpose of the margining system is to ensure that funds are available to pay traders when they make a profit. Overall the system has been very successful. Traders entering into contracts at major exchanges have always had their contracts honored. Futures markets were tested on October 19, 1987, when the S&P 500 index declined by over  $20\%$  and traders with long positions in S&P 500 futures found they had negative margin balances with their brokers. Traders who did not meet margin calls were closed out but still owed their brokers money. Some did not pay and as a result some brokers went bankrupt because, without their clients' money, they were unable to meet margin calls on contracts they entered into on behalf of their clients. However, the clearing houses had sufficient funds to ensure that everyone who had a short futures position on the S&P 500 got paid.

# 2.5 OTC MARKETS

Over-the-counter (OTC) markets, introduced in Chapter 1, are markets where companies agree to derivatives transactions without involving an exchange. Credit risk has traditionally been a feature of OTC derivatives markets. Consider two companies, A and B, that have entered into a number of derivatives transactions. If A defaults when the net value of the outstanding transactions to B is positive, a loss is likely to be taken by B. Similarly, if B defaults when the net value of outstanding transactions to A is positive, a loss is likely to be taken by company A. In an attempt to reduce credit risk, the OTC market has borrowed some ideas from exchange-traded markets. We now discuss this.

# Central Counterparties

We briefly mentioned CCPs in Section 1.2. These are clearing houses for standard OTC transactions that perform much the same role as exchange clearing houses. Members of the CCP, similarly to members of an exchange clearing house, have to provide both initial margin and daily variation margin. Like members of an exchange clearing house, they are also required to contribute to a guaranty fund.

Once an OTC derivative transaction has been agreed between two parties A and B, it can be presented to a CCP. Assuming the CCP accepts the transaction, it becomes the counterparty to both A and B. (This is similar to the way the clearing house of a futures exchange becomes the counterparty to the two sides of a futures trade.) For example, if the transaction is a forward contract where A has agreed to buy an asset from B in one year for a certain price, the clearing house agrees to

1. Buy the asset from B in one year for the agreed price, and
2. Sell the asset to A in one year for the agreed price.

It takes on the credit risk of both A and B.

All members of the CCP are required to provide initial margin to the CCP. Transactions are valued daily and there are daily variation margin payments to or from the member. If an OTC market participant is not itself a member of a CCP, it can arrange to clear its trades through a CCP member. It will then have to provide margin to the CCP member. Its relationship with the CCP member is similar to the relationship between a broker and a futures exchange clearing house member.

Following the financial crisis that started in 2007, regulators have become more concerned about systemic risk (see Business Snapshot 1.2). One result of this, mentioned in Section 1.2, has been legislation requiring that most standard OTC transactions between financial institutions be handled by CCPs.

# Bilateral Clearing

Those OTC transactions that are not cleared through CCPs are cleared bilaterally. In the bilaterally cleared OTC market, two companies A and B usually enter into a master agreement covering all their trades. This agreement usually includes an annex, referred to as the credit support annex or CSA, requiring A or B, or both, to provide collateral. The collateral is similar to the margin required by exchange clearing houses or CCPs from their members.

Collateral agreements in CSAs usually require transactions to be valued each day. A simple two-way agreement between companies A and B might work as follows. If, from one day to the next, the transactions between A and B increase in value to A by X (and therefore decrease in value to B by X), B is required to provide collateral worth X to A. If the reverse happens and the transactions increase in value to B by X (and decrease in value to A by X), A is required to provide collateral worth X to B. (To use the terminology of exchange-traded markets, X is the variation margin provided.) Collateral agreements and the way counterparty credit risk is assessed for bilaterally cleared transactions is discussed further in Chapter 24.

# Business Snapshot 2.2 Long-Term Capital Management's Big Loss

Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund formed in the mid-1990s, always collateralized its bilaterally cleared transactions. The hedge fund's investment strategy was known as convergence arbitrage. A very simple example of what it might do is the following. It would find two bonds, X and Y, issued by the same company that promised the same payoffs, with X being less liquid (i.e., less actively traded) than Y. The market places a value on liquidity. As a result the price of X would be less than the price of Y. LTCM would buy X, short Y, and wait, expecting the prices of the two bonds to converge at some future time.

When interest rates increased, the company expected both bonds to move down in price by about the same amount, so that the collateral it paid on bond X would be about the same as the collateral it received on bond Y. Similarly, when interest rates decreased, LTCM expected both bonds to move up in price by about the same amount, so that the collateral it received on bond X would be about the same as the collateral it paid on bond Y. It therefore expected that there would be no significant outflow of funds as a result of its collateralization agreements.

In August 1998, Russia defaulted on its debt and this led to what is termed a "flight to quality" in capital markets. One result was that investors valued liquid instruments more highly than usual and the spreads between the prices of the liquid and illiquid instruments in LTCM's portfolio increased dramatically. The prices of the bonds LTCM had bought went down and the prices of those it had shorted increased. It was required to post collateral on both. The company experienced difficulties because it was highly leveraged. Positions had to be closed out and LTCM lost about 4 billion. If the company had been less highly leveraged, it would probably have been able to survive the flight to quality and could have waited for the prices of the liquid and illiquid bonds to move back closer to each other.

It has historically been relatively rare for a CSA to require initial margin. This is changing. Starting in 2016, regulations were introduced to require both initial margin and variation margin for bilaterally cleared transactions between financial institutions. The initial margin is posted with a third party.

Collateral significantly reduces credit risk in the bilaterally cleared OTC market (and so the use of CCPs for standard transactions between financial institutions and regulations requiring initial margin for other transactions between financial institutions should reduce risks for the financial system). Collateral agreements were used by hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) for its bilaterally cleared derivatives in the 1990s. The agreements allowed LTCM to be highly levered. They did provide credit protection, but as described in Business Snapshot 2.2, the high leverage left the hedge fund exposed to other risks.

Figure 2.2 illustrates the way bilateral and central clearing work. (It makes the simplifying assumption that there are only eight market participants and one CCP). Under bilateral clearing there are many different agreements between market partici

(b) pants, as indicated in Figure 2.2a. If all OTC contracts were cleared through a single CCP, we would move to the situation shown in Figure 2.2b. In practice, because not all OTC transactions are routed through CCPs and there is more than one CCP, the market has elements of both Figure 2.2a and Figure 2.2b.

# Futures Trades vs. OTC Trades

Regardless of how transactions are cleared, initial margin when provided in the form of cash usually earns interest. The daily variation margin provided by a clearing house member for futures contracts does not earn interest. This is because the variation margin constitutes the daily settlement. Transactions in the OTC market, whether cleared through CCPs or cleared bilaterally, are usually not settled daily. For this reason, the daily variation margin that is provided by the member of a CCP or, as a result of a CSA, earns interest when it is in the form of cash.

Securities can be often be used to satisfy margin/collateral requirements. $^6$  The market value of the securities is reduced by a certain amount to determine their value for margin purposes. This reduction is known as a haircut.

# 2.6 MARKET QUOTES

Futures quotes are available from exchanges and several online sources. Table 2.2 is constructed from quotes provided by the CME Group for a number of different commodities on May 21, 2020. Quotes for index, currency, and interest rate futures are given in Chapters 3, 5, and 6, respectively.

The asset underlying the futures contract, the contract size, and the way the price is quoted are shown at the top of each section of Table 2.2. The first asset is gold. The contract size is 100 ounces and the price is quoted as dollars per ounce. The maturity month of the contract is indicated in the first column of the table.

# Prices

The first three numbers in each row of Table 2.2 show the opening price, the highest price in trading so far during the day, and the lowest price in trading so far during the day. The opening price is representative of the prices at which contracts were trading immediately after the start of trading on a day. For the June 2020 gold contract, the opening price on May 21, 2020 was  \$1,751.7 per ounce. The highest price during the day was also\$ 1,751.7 per ounce and the lowest price during the day was 1,713.3 per ounce.

# Settlement Price

The settlement price is the price used for calculating daily gains and losses and margin requirements. It is usually calculated as the price at which the contract traded immediately before the end of a day's trading session. The fourth number in Table 2.2 shows the settlement price the previous day. The fifth number shows the most recent trading price, and the sixth number shows the price change from the previous day's settlement price. In the case of the June 2020 gold contract, the previous day's settlement price was  \$1,752.1. The most recent trade was at$ 1,725.5, $26.6 lower than the previous day's settlement price. If \$1,725.5 proved to be the settlement price on May 21, 2020, the margin account of a trader with a long position in one contract would lose 2,660 on May 21, 2020 and the margin account of a trader with a short position in one contract would gain this amount on that date.

# Trading Volume and Open Interest

The final column of Table 2.2 shows the trading volume. The trading volume is the number of contracts traded in a day. It can be contrasted with the open interest, which is the number of contracts outstanding, that is, the number of long positions or, equivalently, the number of short positions.

If there is a large amount of trading by day traders (i.e., traders who enter into a position and close it out on the same day), the volume of trading in a day can be greater than either the beginning-of-day or end-of-day open interest.

# Patterns of Futures

Futures prices can show a number of different patterns. They can increase with the maturity of the futures contract, decrease with the maturity of the futures contract, or show a mixed pattern where the futures price sometimes increases and sometimes decreases with maturity. A futures market where prices increase with maturity is known as a normal market. A futures market where futures prices decrease with maturity is known as an inverted market. Table 2.2 indicates that gold, crude oil, corn, and wheat exhibited a normal market on May 21, 2020 for the range of maturities considered. Soyabean and live cattle exhibit a mixture of the two patterns: normal for some maturity ranges and inverted for others.

# 2.7 DELIVERY

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, very few of the futures contracts that are entered into lead to delivery of the underlying asset. Most are closed out early. Nevertheless, it is the possibility of eventual delivery that determines the futures price. An understanding of delivery procedures is therefore important.

The period during which delivery can be made is defined by the exchange and varies from contract to contract. The decision on when to deliver is made by the party with the short position, whom we shall refer to as trader A. When trader A decides to deliver, trader A's broker issues a notice of intention to deliver to the exchange clearing house. This notice states how many contracts will be delivered and, in the case of commodities, also specifies where delivery will be made and what grade will be delivered. The exchange then chooses a party with a long position to accept delivery.

Suppose that the party on the other side of trader A's futures contract when it was entered into was trader B. It is important to realize that there is no reason to expect that it will be trader B who takes delivery. Trader B may well have closed out his or her position by trading with trader C, trader C may have closed out his or her position by trading with trader D, and so on. The usual rule chosen by the exchange is to pass the notice of intention to deliver on to the party with the oldest outstanding long position. Parties with long positions must accept delivery notices. However, if the notices are transferable, traders with long positions usually have a short period of time to find another party with a long position that is prepared to take delivery in place of them.

In the case of a commodity, taking delivery usually means accepting a warehouse receipt in return for immediate payment. The party taking delivery is then responsible for all warehousing costs. In the case of livestock futures, there may be costs associated with feeding and looking after the animals (see Business Snapshot 2.1). In the case of financial futures, delivery is usually made by wire transfer. For all contracts, the price paid is usually the most recent settlement price. If specified by the exchange, this price is adjusted for grade, location of delivery, and so on.

There are three critical days for a contract. These are the first notice day, the last notice day, and the last trading day. The first notice day is the first day on which a notice of intention to make delivery can be submitted to the exchange. The last notice day is the last such day. The last trading day is generally a few days before the last notice day. To avoid the risk of having to take delivery, a trader with a long position should close out his or her contracts prior to the first notice day.

# Cash Settlement

Some financial futures, such as those on stock indices discussed in Chapter 3, are settled in cash because it is inconvenient or impossible to deliver the underlying asset. In the case of the futures contract on the S&P 500, for example, delivering the underlying asset would involve delivering a portfolio of 500 stocks. When a contract is settled in cash, all outstanding contracts are declared closed on a predetermined day. The final settlement price is set equal to the spot price of the underlying asset at either the open or close of trading on that day. For example, in the S&P 500 futures contract traded by the CME Group, the predetermined day is the third Friday of the delivery month and final settlement is at the opening price on that day.

# 2.8 TYPES OF TRADERS AND TYPES OF ORDERS

There are two main types of traders executing trades: futures commission merchants (FCMs) and locals. FCMs are following the instructions of their clients and charge a commission for doing so; locals are trading on their own account.

Individuals taking positions, whether locals or the clients of FCMs, can be categorized as hedgers, speculators, or arbitrageurs, as discussed in Chapter 1. Speculators can be classified as scalpers, day traders, or position traders. Scalpers are watching for very short-term trends and attempt to profit from small changes in the contract price. They usually hold their positions for only a few minutes. Day traders hold their positions for less than one trading day. They are unwilling to take the risk that adverse news will occur overnight. Position traders hold their positions for much longer periods of time. They hope to make significant profits from major movements in the markets.

# Orders

The simplest type of order placed with a broker is a market order. It is a request that a trade be carried out immediately at the best price available in the market. However, there are many other types of orders. We will consider those that are more commonly used.

A limit order specifies a particular price. The order can be executed only at this price or at one more favorable to the trader. Thus, if the limit price is \$30 for a trader wanting to buy, the order will be executed only at a price of \$30 or less. There is, of course, no guarantee that the order will be executed at all, because the limit price may never be reached.

A stop order or stop-loss order also specifies a particular price. The order is executed at the best available price once a bid or ask is made at that particular price or a less-favorable price. Suppose a stop order to sell at \$30 is issued when the market price is \$35. It becomes an order to sell when and if the price falls to 30. In effect, a stop order becomes a market order as soon as the specified price has been hit. The purpose of a stop order is usually to close out a position if unfavorable price movements take place. It limits the loss that can be incurred.

A stop-limit order is a combination of a stop order and a limit order. The order becomes a limit order as soon as a bid or ask is made at a price equal to or less favorable than the stop price. Two prices must be specified in a stop-limit order: the stop price and the limit price. Suppose that at the time the market price is \$35, a stop-limit order to buy is issued with a stop price of \$40 and a limit price of \$41. As soon as there is a bid or ask at \$40, the stop-limit becomes a limit order at 41. If the stop price and the limit price are the same, the order is sometimes called a stop-and-limit order.

A market-if-touched (MIT) order is executed at the best available price after a trade occurs at a specified price or at a price more favorable than the specified price. In effect, an MIT becomes a market order once the specified price has been hit. An MIT is also known as a board order. Consider a trader who has a long position in a futures contract and is issuing instructions that would lead to closing out the contract. A stop order is designed to place a limit on the loss that can occur in the event of unfavorable price movements. By contrast, a market-if-touched order is designed to ensure that profits are taken if sufficiently favorable price movements occur.

A discretionary order or market-not-held order is traded as a market order except that execution may be delayed at the broker's discretion in an attempt to get a better price.

Some orders specify time conditions. Unless otherwise stated, an order is a day order and expires at the end of the trading day. A time-of-day order specifies a particular period of time during the day when the order can be executed. An open order or a good-till-canceled order is in effect until executed or until the end of trading in the particular contract. A fill-or-kill order, as its name implies, must be executed immediately on receipt or not at all.

# 2.9 REGULATION

Futures markets in the United States are currently regulated federally by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC; www.cftc.gov), which was established in 1974.

The CFTC looks after the public interest. It is responsible for ensuring that prices are communicated to the public and that futures traders report their outstanding positions if they are above certain levels. The CFTC also licenses all individuals who offer their services to the public in futures trading. The backgrounds of these individuals are investigated, and there are minimum capital requirements. The CFTC deals with complaints brought by the public and ensures that disciplinary action is taken against individuals when appropriate. It has the authority to force exchanges to take disciplinary action against members who are in violation of exchange rules.

With the formation of the National Futures Association (NFA; www.nfa.futures.org) in 1982, some of responsibilities of the CFTC were shifted to the futures industry itself. The NFA is an organization of individuals who participate in the futures industry. Its objective is to prevent fraud and to ensure that the market operates in the best interests of the general public. It is authorized to monitor trading and take disciplinary action when appropriate. The agency has set up an efficient system for arbitrating disputes between individuals and its members.

The Dodd-Frank act, signed into law by President Obama in 2010, expanded the role of the CFTC. For example, it is now responsible for rules requiring that standard over-the-counter derivatives between financial institutions be traded on swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties (see Section 1.2).

# Trading Irregularities

Most of the time futures markets operate efficiently and in the public interest. However, from time to time, trading irregularities do come to light. One type of trading irregularity occurs when a trader group tries to "corner the market." The trader group takes a huge long futures position and also tries to exercise some control over the supply of the underlying commodity. As the maturity of the futures contracts is approached, the trader group does not close out its position, so that the number of outstanding futures contracts may exceed the amount of the commodity available for delivery. The holders of short positions realize that they will find it difficult to deliver and become desperate to close out their positions. The result is a large rise in both futures and spot prices. Regulators usually deal with this type of abuse of the market by increasing margin requirements or imposing stricter position limits or prohibiting trades that increase a speculator's open position or requiring market participants to close out their positions.

# 2.10 ACCOUNTING AND TAX

The full details of the accounting and tax treatment of futures contracts are beyond the scope of this book. A trader who wants detailed information on this should obtain professional advice. This section provides some general background information.

# Accounting

Accounting standards require changes in the market value of a futures contract to be recognized when they occur unless the contract qualifies as a hedge. If the contract does qualify as a hedge, gains or losses are generally recognized for accounting purposes in the same period in which the gains or losses from the item being hedged are recognized. The latter treatment is referred to as hedge accounting.

Consider a company with a December year end. In September 2020 it buys a March 2021 corn futures contract and closes out the position at the end of February 2021. Suppose that the futures prices are 350 cents per bushel when the contract is entered into, 370 cents per bushel at the end of 2020, and 380 cents per bushel when the contract is closed out. The contract is for the delivery of 5,000 bushels. If the contract does not qualify as a hedge, the gains for accounting purposes are

$$
5, 0 0 0 \times (3. 7 0 - 3. 5 0) = \$ 1, 0 0 0
$$ in 2020 and


$$

5, 0 0 0 \times (3. 8 0 - 3. 7 0) = \$ 5 0 0

$$ in 2021. If the company is hedging the purchase of 5,000 bushels of corn in February 2021 so that the contract qualifies for hedge accounting, the entire gain of 1,500 is realized in 2021 for accounting purposes.


The treatment of hedging gains and losses is sensible. If the company is hedging the purchase of 5,000 bushels of corn in February 2021, the effect of the futures contract is to ensure that the price paid (inclusive of the futures gain or loss) is close to 350 cents per bushel. The accounting treatment reflects that this price is paid in 2021.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued FAS 133 and ASC 815 explaining when companies can and cannot use hedge accounting. The International Accounting Standards Board has similarly issued IAS 39 and IFRS 9.

# Tax

Under the U.S. tax rules, two key issues are the nature of a taxable gain or loss and the timing of the recognition of the gain or loss. Gains or losses are either classified as capital gains or losses or alternatively as part of ordinary income.

For a corporate taxpayer, capital gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, and the ability to deduct losses is restricted. Capital losses are deductible only to the extent of capital gains. A corporation may carry back a capital loss for three years and carry it forward for up to five years. For a noncorporate taxpayer, short-term capital gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, but long-term capital gains are subject to a maximum capital gains tax rate of  $20\%$ . (Long-term capital gains are gains from the sale of a capital asset held for longer than one year; short-term capital gains are the gains from the sale of a capital asset held one year or less.) Taxpayers earning income above certain thresholds pay an additional  $3.8\%$  on all investment income. For a noncorporate taxpayer, capital losses are deductible to the extent of capital gains plus ordinary income up to 3,000 and can be carried forward indefinitely.


Generally, positions in futures contracts are treated as if they are closed out on the last day of the tax year. For the noncorporate taxpayer, this gives rise to capital gains and losses that are treated as if they were  $60\%$  long term and  $40\%$  short term without regard to the holding period. This is referred to as the "60/40" rule. A noncorporate taxpayer may elect to carry back for three years any net losses from the 60/40 rule to offset any gains recognized under the rule in the previous three years.

Hedging transactions are exempt from this rule. The definition of a hedge transaction for tax purposes is different from that for accounting purposes. The tax regulations define a hedging transaction as a transaction entered into in the normal course of business primarily for one of the following reasons:

1. To reduce the risk of price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to property that is held or to be held by the taxpayer for the purposes of producing ordinary income
2. To reduce the risk of price or interest rate changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made by the taxpayer.

A hedging transaction must be clearly identified in a timely manner in the company's records as a hedge. Gains or losses from hedging transactions are treated as ordinary income. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses from hedging transactions generally matches the timing of the recognition of income or expense associated with the transaction being hedged.

# 2.11 FORWARD vs. FUTURES CONTRACTS

The main differences between forward and futures contracts are summarized in Table 2.3. Both contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset for a certain price at a certain future time. A forward contract is traded in the over-the-counter market and there is no standard contract size or standard delivery arrangements. A single delivery date is usually specified and the contract is usually held to the end of its life and then settled. A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on an exchange. A range of delivery dates is usually specified. It is settled daily and usually closed out prior to maturity.

# Profits from Forward and Futures Contracts

Suppose that the sterling exchange rate for a 90-day forward contract is 1.2000 and that this rate is also the futures price for a contract that will be delivered in exactly 90 days. What is the difference between the gains and losses under the two contracts?

Under the forward contract, the whole gain or loss is realized at the end of the life of the contract. Under the futures contract, the gain or loss is realized day by day because of the daily settlement procedures. Suppose that trader A is long £1 million in

Table 2.3 Comparison of forward and futures contracts.

<table><tr><td>Forward</td><td>Futures</td></tr><tr><td>Private contract between two parties</td><td>Traded on an exchange</td></tr><tr><td>Not standardized</td><td>Standardized contract</td></tr><tr><td>Usually one specified delivery date</td><td>Range of delivery dates</td></tr><tr><td>Settled at end of contract</td><td>Settled daily</td></tr><tr><td>Delivery or final cash settlement usually takes place</td><td>Contract is usually closed out prior to maturity</td></tr><tr><td>Some credit risk</td><td>Virtually no credit risk</td></tr></table> a 90-day forward contract and trader B is long £1 million in 90-day futures contracts. (Because each futures contract is for the purchase or sale of £62,500, trader B must purchase a total of 16 contracts.) Assume that the spot exchange rate in 90 days proves to be 1.4000 dollars per pound. Trader A makes a gain of \$200,000 on the 90th day. Trader B makes the same gain—but spread out over the 90-day period. On some days trader B may realize a loss, whereas on other days he or she makes a gain. However, in total, when losses are netted against gains, there is a gain of \$200,000 over the 90-day period.


# Foreign Exchange Quotes

Both forward and futures contracts trade actively on foreign currencies. However, there is sometimes a difference in the way exchange rates are quoted in the two markets. For example, futures prices where one currency is the U.S. dollar are always quoted as the number of U.S. dollars per unit of the foreign currency or as the number of U.S. cents per unit of the foreign currency. Forward prices are always quoted in the same way as spot prices. This means that, for the British pound, the euro, the Australian dollar, and the New Zealand dollar, the forward quotes show the number of U.S. dollars per unit of the foreign currency and are directly comparable with futures quotes. For other major currencies, forward quotes show the number of units of the foreign currency per U.S. dollar (USD). Consider the Canadian dollar (CAD). A futures price quote of 0.7500 USD per CAD corresponds to a forward price quote of 1.3333 CAD per USD  $(1.3333 = 1 / 0.7500)$ .

# SUMMARY

A very high proportion of the futures contracts that are traded do not lead to the delivery of the underlying asset. Traders usually enter into offsetting contracts to close out their positions before the delivery period is reached. However, it is the possibility of final delivery that drives the determination of the futures price. For each futures contract, there is a range of days during which delivery can be made and a well-defined delivery procedure. Some contracts, such as those on stock indices, are settled in cash rather than by delivery of the underlying asset.

The specification of contracts is an important activity for a futures exchange. The two sides to any contract must know what can be delivered, where delivery can take place, and when delivery can take place. They also need to know details on the trading hours, how prices will be quoted, maximum daily price movements, and so on. New contracts must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before trading starts.

Margin accounts are an important aspect of futures markets. A trader keeps a margin account with his or her broker. The account is adjusted daily to reflect gains or losses, and from time to time the broker may require the account to be topped up if adverse price movements have taken place. The broker either must be a clearing house member or must maintain a margin account with a clearing house member. Each clearing house member maintains a margin account with the exchange clearing house. The balance in the account is adjusted daily to reflect gains and losses on the business for which the clearing house member is responsible.

In over-the-counter derivatives markets, transactions are cleared either bilaterally or centrally. When bilateral clearing is used, collateral frequently has to be posted by one or both parties to reduce credit risk. When central clearing is used, a central counterparty (CCP) stands between the two sides. It requires each side to provide margin and performs much the same function as an exchange clearing house.

Forward contracts differ from futures contracts in a number of ways. Forward contracts are private arrangements between two parties, whereas futures contracts are traded on exchanges. There is generally a single delivery date in a forward contract, whereas futures contracts frequently involve a range of such dates. Because they are not traded on exchanges, forward contracts do not need to be standardized. A forward contract is not usually settled until the end of its life, and most contracts do in fact lead to delivery of the underlying asset or a cash settlement at this time.

In the next few chapters we shall examine in more detail the ways in which forward and futures contracts can be used for hedging. We shall also look at how forward and futures prices are determined.

# Hedging Strategies Using Futures

Many of the participants in futures markets are hedgers. Their aim is to use futures markets to reduce a particular risk that they face. This risk might relate to fluctuations in the price of oil, a foreign exchange rate, the level of the stock market, or some other variable. A perfect hedge is one that completely eliminates the risk. Perfect hedges are rare. For the most part, therefore, a study of hedging using futures contracts is a study of the ways in which hedges can be constructed so that they perform as close to perfectly as possible.

In this chapter we consider a number of general issues associated with the way hedges are set up. When is a short futures position appropriate? When is a long futures position appropriate? Which futures contract should be used? What is the optimal size of the futures position for reducing risk? At this stage, we restrict our attention to what might be termed hedge-and-forget strategies. We assume that no attempt is made to adjust the hedge once it has been put in place. The hedger simply takes a futures position at the beginning of the life of the hedge and closes out the position at the end of the life of the hedge. In Chapter 19 we will examine dynamic hedging strategies in which the hedge is monitored closely and frequent adjustments are made.

The chapter initially treats futures contracts as forward contracts (that is, it ignores daily settlement). Later it explains adjustments that are necessary to take account of the difference between futures and forwards.
