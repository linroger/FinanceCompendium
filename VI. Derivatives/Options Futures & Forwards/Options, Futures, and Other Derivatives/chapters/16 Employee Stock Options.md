# 16.1 CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS

Employee stock options often last as long as 10 to 15 years. Very often the strike price is set equal to the stock price on the grant date so that the option is initially at the money.

The following are common features of employee stock option plans:

1. There is a vesting period during which the options cannot be exercised. This vesting period can be as long as four years.
2. When employees leave their jobs (voluntarily or involuntarily) during the vesting period, they forfeit their options.
3. When employees leave (voluntarily or involuntarily) after the vesting period, they forfeit options that are out of the money and they have to exercise vested options that are in the money almost immediately.
4. Employees are not permitted to sell the options.
5. When an employee exercises options, the company issues new shares and sells them to the employee for the strike price.

# The Early Exercise Decision

The fourth feature of employee stock option plans noted above has important implications. If employees, for whatever reason, want to realize a cash benefit from options that have vested, they must exercise the options and sell the underlying shares. They cannot sell the options to someone else. This leads to a tendency for employee stock options to be exercised earlier than similar exchange-traded or over-the-counter call options.

Consider a call option on a stock paying no dividends. In Section 11.5 we showed that, if it is a regular call option, it should never be exercised early. The holder of the option will always do better by selling the option rather than exercising it before the end of its life. However, the arguments we used in Section 11.5 are not applicable to employee stock options because they cannot be sold. The only way employees can realize a cash benefit from the options (or diversify their holdings) is by exercising the options and selling the stock. It is therefore not unusual for an employee stock option to be exercised well before it would be optimal to exercise the option if it were a regular exchange-traded or over-the-counter option.

Should an employee ever exercise his or her options before maturity and then keep the stock rather than selling it? Assume that the option's strike price is constant during the life of the option and the option can be exercised at any time. To answer the question we consider two options: the employee stock option and an otherwise identical regular option that can be sold in the market. We refer to the first option as option A and the second as option B. If the stock pays no dividends, we know that option B should never be exercised early. It follows that it is not optimal to exercise option A and keep the stock. If the employee wants to maintain a stake in his or her company, a better strategy is to keep the option. This delays paying the strike price and maintains the insurance value of the option, as described in Section 11.5. Only when it is optimal to exercise option B can it be a rational strategy for an employee to exercise option A before maturity and keep the stock. As discussed in Section 15.12, it is optimal to exercise option B only when a relatively high dividend is imminent.

In practice the early exercise behavior of employees varies widely from company to company. In some companies, there is a culture of not exercising early; in others, employees tend to exercise options and sell the stock soon after the end of the vesting period, even if the options are only slightly in the money.

# 16.2 DO OPTIONS ALIGN THE INTERESTS OF SHAREHOLDERS AND MANAGERS?

For investors to have confidence in capital markets, it is important that the interests of shareholders and managers are reasonably well aligned. This means that managers should be motivated to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders. Managers are the agents of the shareholders and, as mentioned in Chapter 8, economists use the term agency costs to describe the losses experienced when the interests of agents and principals are not aligned.

Do employee stock options help align the interests of employees and shareholders? The answer to this question is not straightforward. There can be little doubt that they serve a useful purpose for a start-up company. The options are an excellent way for the main shareholders, who are usually also senior executives, to motivate employees to work long hours. If the company is successful and there is an IPO, the employees will do very well; but if the company is unsuccessful, the options will be worthless.

It is the options granted to the senior executives of publicly traded companies that are most controversial. Executive stock options are sometimes referred to as an executive's "pay for performance." If the company's stock price goes up, so that shareholders make gains, the executive is rewarded. However, this overlooks the asymmetric payoffs of options. If the company does badly then the shareholders lose money, but all that happens to the executives is that they fail to make a gain. Unlike the shareholders, they do not experience a loss. Many people think that a better type of pay for performance is a restricted stock unit. This entitles the executive to own a share of the company's stock at a particular future time (the vesting date). The gains and losses of the executives then mirror those of other shareholders. It is sometimes argued that the asymmetric payoffs of options can lead to senior executives taking risks they would not otherwise take. This may or may not be in the interests of the company's shareholders.

What temptations do stock options create for a senior executive? Suppose an executive plans to exercise a large number of stock options in three months and sell the stock. He or she might be tempted to time announcements of good news—or even move earnings from one quarter to another—so that the stock price increases just before the options are exercised. Alternatively, if at-the-money options are due to be granted to the executive in three months, the executive might be tempted to take actions that reduce the stock price just before the grant date. The type of behavior we are talking about here is of course totally unacceptable—and may well be illegal. But the backdating scandals, which are discussed later in this chapter, show that the way some executives have handled issues related to stock options leaves much to be desired.

Even when there is no impropriety of the type we have just mentioned, executive stock options are liable to have the effect of motivating executives to focus on short-term profits at the expense of longer-term performance. Managers of large funds worry that, because stock options are such a huge component of an executive's compensation, they are liable to be a big source of distraction. Senior management may spend too much time thinking about all the different aspects of their compensation and not enough time running the company.

A manager's inside knowledge and ability to affect outcomes and announcements is always liable to interact with his or her trading in a way that is to the disadvantage of other shareholders. One radical suggestion for mitigating this problem is to require executives to give notice to the market—perhaps one week's notice—of an intention to buy or sell their company's stock. (Once the notice of an intention to trade had been given, it would be binding on the executive.) This allows the market to form its own conclusions about why the executive is trading. As a result, the price may increase before the executive buys and decrease before the executive sells.

# 16.3 ACCOUNTING ISSUES

An employee stock option represents a cost to the company and a benefit to the employee just like any other form of compensation. This point, which for many is self-evident, is actually quite controversial. Many corporate executives appear to believe that an option has no value unless it is in the money. As a result, they argue that an at-the-money option issued by the company is not a cost to the company. The reality is that, if options are valuable to employees, they must represent a cost to the company's shareholders—and therefore to the company. There is no free lunch. The cost to the company of the options arises from the fact that the company has agreed that, if its stock does well, it will sell shares to employees at a price less than that which would apply in the open market.

Prior to 1995, the cost charged to the income statement of a company when it issued stock options was the intrinsic value. Most options were at the money when they were first issued, so that this cost was zero. In 1995, accounting standard FAS 123 was issued. Many people expected it to require the expensing of options at their fair value. However, as a result of intense lobbying, the 1995 version of FAS 123 only encouraged companies to expense the fair value of the options they granted on the income statement. It did not require them to do so. If fair value was not expensed on the income statement, it had to be reported in a footnote to the company's accounts.

Accounting standards have now changed to require the expensing of all stock-based compensation at its fair value on the income statement. In February 2004, the International Accounting Standards Board issued IAS 2 requiring companies to start expensing stock options in 2005. In December 2004, FAS 123 was revised to require the expensing of employee stock options in the United States starting in 2005.

The effect of the new accounting standards is to require options to be valued on the grant date and the amount to be recorded as an expense in the income statement for the year in which the grant is made. Valuation at a time later than the grant date is not required. It can be argued that options should be revalued at financial year ends (or every quarter) until they are exercised or reach the end of their lives. This would treat them in the same way as other derivative transactions entered into by the company. If the option became more valuable from one year to the next, there would then be an additional amount to be expensed. However, if it declined in value, there would be a positive impact on income.

This approach would have a number of advantages. The cumulative charge to the company would reflect the actual cost of the options (either zero if the options are not exercised or the option payoff if they are exercised). Although the charge in any year would depend on the option pricing model used, the cumulative charge over the life of the option would not. Arguably there would be much less incentive for the company to engage in the backdating practices described later in the chapter. The disadvantage usually cited for accounting in this way is that it is undesirable because it introduces volatility into the income statement.

# Alternatives to Stock Options

The accounting rules which came into effect in 2005 have led companies to consider alternatives to traditional compensation plans where at-the-money stock options are granted. We have already mentioned restricted stock units (RSUs), which are shares that will be owned by the employee at a future time (the vesting date). Many companies have replaced stock options by RSUs. A variation on an RSU is a market-leveraged stock unit (MSU), in which the number of shares that will be owned on the vesting date is equal to  $S_T / S_0$ , where  $S_0$  is the stock price on the grant date and  $S_T$  is the stock price on the vesting date.

If the stock market as a whole goes up, employees with stock options tend to do well, even if their own company's stock price underperforms the market. One way of overcoming this problem is to tie the strike price of the options to the performance of a broadly based index. Suppose that on the option grant date the stock price is  \$30 and the index is 2,000. The strike price would initially be set at \$30. If the index increased by 10\% to 2,200, then the strike price would also increase by 10\% to \$33. If the index moved down by 15\% to 1,700, then the strike price would also move down by 15\% to \$25.50. The effect of this is that the company's stock price performance has to beat that of the index to become in the money. As an alternative to using a broadly based index as the reference index, the company could use an index of the prices of stocks in the same industrial sector as the company.

# 16.4 VALUATION

Accounting standards give companies quite a bit of latitude in choosing a method for valuing employee stock options. In this section we review some of the alternatives.

# Using the Black-Scholes-Merton Model

A frequently used approach is based on what is known as the option's expected life. This is the average time for which employees hold the option before it is exercised or expires. The expected life can be approximately estimated from historical data on the early exercise behavior of employees and reflects the vesting period, the impact of employees leaving the company, and the tendency we mentioned in Section 16.1 for employee stock options to be exercised earlier than regular options. The Black-Scholes-Merton model is used with the life of the option,  $T$ , set equal to the expected life. The volatility is usually estimated from several years of historical data as described in Section 15.4.

It should be emphasized that using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula in this way has no theoretical validity. There is no reason why the value of a European stock option with the time to maturity,  $T$ , set equal to the expected life should be approximately the same as the value of the American-style employee stock option that we are interested in. However, the results given by the model are not unreasonable in many situations. Companies, when reporting their employee stock option expense, will frequently mention the volatility and expected life used in their Black-Scholes-Merton computations.

# Example 16.1

A company grants 1,000,000 options to its executives on November 1, 2021. The stock price on that date is  \$30 and the strike price of the options is also \$30. The options last for 10 years and vest after three years. The company has issued similar at-the-money options for the last 10 years. The average time to exercise or expiry of these options is 4.5 years. The company therefore decides to use an "expected life" of 4.5 years. It estimates the long-term volatility of the stock price, using 5 years of historical data, to be 25\%. The present value of dividends during the next 4.5 years is estimated to be \$4. The 4.5-year zero-coupon risk-free interest rate is 5\%. The option is therefore valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton model (adjusted for dividends in the way described in Section 15.12) with  $S_0 = 30 - 4 = 26$ ,  $K = 30$ ,  $r = 5\%$ ,  $\sigma = 25\%$ , and  $T = 4.5$ . The Black-Scholes-Merton formula gives the value of one option as \$6.31. Hence, the income statement expense is 1,000,000 × 6.31, or 6,310,000.

# Binomial Tree Approach

A more sophisticated approach to valuing employee stock options involves building a binomial tree as outlined in Chapter 13 and adjusting the rules used when rolling back through the tree to reflect (a) whether the option has vested, (b) the probability of the employee leaving the company, and (c) the probability of the employee choosing to exercise the option. The terms of the option define whether the option has vested at different nodes of the tree. Historical data on turnover rates for employees can be used to estimate the probability of the option being either prematurely exercised or forfeited at a node because the employee leaves the company. The probability of an employee choosing to exercise the option at different nodes of the tree is more difficult to quantify. Clearly this probability increases as the ratio of the stock price to the strike price increases and as the time to the option's maturity declines. If enough historical data is available, the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables can be estimated—at least approximately.

# Example 16.2

Suppose a company grants stock options that last 8 years and vest after 3 years. The stock price and strike price are both \$40. The stock price volatility is  $30\%$ , the risk-free rate is  $5\%$ , and the company pays no dividends. Figure 16.1 shows how a four-step tree could be used to value the option. (This is for illustration; in practice more time steps would be used.) In this case,  $\sigma = 0.3$ ,  $\Delta t = 2$ , and  $r = 0.05$ , so that, with the notation of Chapter 13,  $a = e^{0.05 \times 2} = 1.1052$ ,  $u = e^{0.3\sqrt{2}} = 1.5285$ ,  $d = 1 / u = 0.6543$ , and  $p = (a - d) / (u - d) = 0.5158$ . The probability on the "up branches" is 0.5158 and the probability on the "down branches" is 0.4842. There are three nodes where early exercise could be desirable: D, G, and H. (The option has not vested at node B and is not in the money at the other nodes prior to maturity.) We assume that the probabilities that the holder will choose to exercise at nodes D, G, and H (conditional on no earlier exercise) have been estimated as  $40\%$ ,  $80\%$ , and  $30\%$ , respectively. We suppose that the probability of an employee leaving the company during each time step is  $5\%$ . (This corresponds to an employee turnover rate of approximately  $2.5\%$  per year.) For the purposes of the calculation, it is assumed that employees always leave at the end of a time period. If an employee leaves the company before an option has vested or when the option is out of the money, the option is forfeited. In other cases the option must be exercised immediately.

At each node:

Upper value = Underlying asset price

Lower value = Option price

Values in bold are a result of early exercise.

Figure 16.1 Valuation of employee stock option in Example 16.2.

The value of the option at the final nodes is its intrinsic value. Consider the nodes at time 6 years. Nodes I and J are easy. Since these nodes are certain to lead to nodes where the option is worth nothing, the value of the option is zero at these nodes. At node H there is a  $30\%$  chance that the employee will choose to exercise the option. In cases where the employee does not choose to exercise, there is a  $5\%$  chance that the employee leaves the company and has to exercise. The total probability of exercise is therefore  $0.3 + 0.7 \times 0.05 = 0.335$ . If the option is exercised, its value is  $61.14 - 40 = 21.14$ . If it is not exercised, its value is

$$
e^{-0.05 \times 2} (0.5158 \times 53.45 + 0.4842 \times 0) = 24.95
$$

The value of the option at node H is therefore

$$
0.335 \times 21.14 + 0.665 \times 24.95 = 23.67
$$

The value at node G is similarly

$$
0.81 \times 102.83 + 0.19 \times 106.64 = 103.56
$$

We now move on to the nodes at time 4 years. At node F the option is clearly worth zero. At node E there is a  $5\%$  chance that the employee will forfeit the option because he or she leaves the company and a  $95\%$  chance that the option will be retained. In the latter case the option is worth

$$
e^{-0.05 \times 2} (0.5158 \times 23.67 + 0.4842 \times 0) = 11.05
$$

The option is therefore worth  $0.95 \times 11.05 = 10.49$ . At node D there is a 0.43 probability that the option will be exercised and a 0.57 chance that it will be retained. The value of the option is 56.44.

Consider next the initial node and the nodes at time 2 years. The option has not vested at these nodes. There is a  $5\%$  chance that the option will be forfeited and a  $95\%$  chance that it will be retained for a further 2 years. This leads to the valuations shown in Figure 16.1. The valuation of the option at the initial node is 14.97. (This compares with a valuation of 17.98 for a regular option using the same tree.)

# Exercise Multiple Approach

Hull and White suggest a simple model where an employee exercises as soon as the option has vested and the ratio of the stock price to the strike price is above a certain level. They refer to the ratio of stock price to strike price that triggers exercise as the "exercise multiple". The option can be valued using a binomial or trinomial tree. As outlined in Section 27.6, it is important to construct a binomial or trinomial tree where nodes lie on the stock prices that will lead to exercise. For example, if the strike price is  \$30 and the assumption is that employees exercise when the ratio of the stock price to the strike price is 1.5, the tree should be constructed so that there are nodes at a stock price level of\$ 45. The tree calculations are similar to those for Example 16.2 and take account of the probability of an employee leaving the company. To estimate the exercise multiple, it is necessary to calculate from historical data the average ratio of stock price to strike price at the time of exercise. (Exercises at maturity and those arising from the termination of the employee's job are not included in the calculation of the average.) This may be easier to estimate from historical data than the expected life because the latter is quite heavily dependent on the particular path that has been followed by the stock's price.

# A Market-Based Approach

One way of valuing an employee stock option is to see what the market would pay for it. Cisco was the first to try this in 2006. It proposed selling options with the exact terms of its employee stock options to institutional investors. This approach was rejected by the SEC on the grounds that the range of investors bidding for the options was not wide enough.

Zions Bancorp has suggested an alternative approach. It proposed that securities providing payoffs mirroring those actually realized by its employees be sold. Suppose that the strike price for a particular grant to employees is  \$40 and it turns out that 1\%$  of employees exercise after exactly 5 years when the stock price is 60,  $2\%$  exercise after exactly 6 years when the stock price is \$65, and so on. Then  $1\%$  of the securities owned by an investor will provide a \$20 payoff after 5 years,  $2\%$  will provide a payoff of 25 after 6 years, and so on.

Zions Bancorp tested the idea using its own stock option grant to its employees. It sold the securities using a Dutch auction process. In this individuals or companies can submit a bid indicating the price they are prepared to pay and the number of options they are prepared to buy. The clearing price is the highest bid such that the aggregate number of options sought at that price or a higher price equals or exceeds the number of options for sale. Buyers who have bid more than the clearing price get their orders filled at the clearing price and the buyer who bid the clearing price gets the remainder. Zions Bancorp announced that it had received SEC approval for its market-based approach in October 2007, but the approach has not been used to any great extent.

# Dilution

The fact that a company issues new stock when an employee stock option is exercised leads to some dilution for existing stock holders because new shares are being sold to employees at below the current stock price. It is natural to assume that this dilution takes place at the time the option is exercised. However, this is not the case. As explained in Section 15.10, stock prices are diluted when the market first hears about a stock option grant. The possible exercise of options is anticipated and immediately reflected in the stock price. This point is emphasized by the example in Business Snapshot 15.3.

The stock price immediately after a grant is announced to the public reflects any dilution. Provided that this stock price is used in the valuation of the option, it is not necessary to adjust the option price for dilution. In many instances the market expects a company to make regular stock option grants and so the market price of the stock anticipates dilution even before the announcement is made.

If a company is contemplating a stock option grant that will surprise the market, the cost can be calculated as described in Example 15.7. This cost can be compared with benefits such as lower regular employee remuneration and less employee turnover.

# 16.5 THE BACKDATING SCANDAL

No discussion of employee stock options would be complete without mentioning a backdating scandal. Backdating is the practice of marking a document with a date that precedes the current date.

Suppose that a company decides to grant at-the-money options to its executives on April 30 when the stock price is \$50. If the stock price was \$42 on April 3, it is tempting to behave as if those the options were granted on April 3 and use a strike price of \$42. This is legal provided that the company reports the options as \$8 in the money on the date when the decision to grant the options is made, April 30. But it is illegal for the company to report the options as at-the-money and granted on April 3. The value on April 3 of an option with a strike price of 42 is much less than its value on April 30. Shareholders are misled about the true cost of the decision to grant options if the company reports the options as granted on April 3.

Prior to 2002, it appears that backdating was not uncommon. Early research by Yermack shows that stock prices tend to increase after reported grant dates.[10] Lie extended Yermack's work, showing that stock prices also tended to decrease before reported grant dates.[11] The period covered by this research was 1993 to 2002. The research clearly shows that stock prices tended to be at a low point on reported grant dates. The stock price on a reported grant date was on average lower than that on each of the 30 days before the grant date and lower than that on each of the 30 days after the grant date. Statistical tests carried out by the researchers showed that this could not have happened by chance. The research led regulators to conclude that backdating was occurring. In August 2002, the SEC required option grants by public companies to be reported within two business days. Heron and Lie showed that this led to a dramatic change in the stock price patterns around the grant date—particularly for those companies that complied with the SEC rule.[12] Reported grant dates were no longer low-stock-price dates. It might be argued that the patterns observed by Yermack and Lie can be explained by managers choosing grant dates after bad news or before good news, but Heron and Lie's research shows that, although there might been a tendency for this to happen, it is not the major explanation of the Yermack and Lie results.

Estimates of the number of companies that illegally backdated stock option grants in the United States vary widely. Tens and maybe hundreds of companies seem to have engaged in the practice. Many companies seem to have adopted the view that it was acceptable to backdate up to one month. Some CEOs resigned when their backdating practices came to light. In August 2007, Gregory Reyes of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., became the first CEO to be tried for backdating stock option grants. Allegedly, Mr. Reyes said to a human resources employee: "It is not illegal if you do not get caught." In June 2010, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined 15 million.

Companies involved in backdating have had to restate past financial statements and have been defendants in class action suits brought by shareholders who claim to have lost money as a result of backdating. For example, McAfee announced in December

2007 that it would restate earnings between 1995 and 2005 by  \$137.4 million. In 2006, it set aside\$ 13.8 million to cover lawsuits.

# SUMMARY

Until 2005, at-the-money stock option grants were a very attractive form of compensation. They had no impact on the income statement and were very valuable to employees. Accounting standards now require options to be expensed.

There are a number of different approaches to valuing employee stock options. A common approach is to use the Black-Scholes-Merton model with the life of the option set equal to the expected time to exercise or expiry of the option. Another approach is to assume that options are exercised as soon as the ratio of the stock price to the strike price reaches a certain barrier. A third approach is to try and estimate the relationship between the probability of exercise, the ratio of the stock price to the strike price, and the time to option maturity. A fourth approach is to create a market for securities that replicate the payoffs on the options.

Academic research has shown beyond doubt that many companies have engaged in the illegal practice of backdating stock option grants in order to reduce the strike price, while still contending that the options were at the money. The first prosecutions for this illegal practice were in 2007.
