## Option Premium

- Black, Scholes and Merton show that (under certain conditions) there exists a trading strategy involving only stocks and bonds that replicate the payoff at  $T$  of a call or a put option.  
- Assume a stock  $S_{t}$  has constant expected (log) return  $\mu$  and constant volatility  $\sigma$ .  
- That is, if the log return during a small time interval  $h$  be  $R_{t} = \log (S_{t + h} / S_{t})$ , assume

$$
E[R_t] = \mu \times h; \quad E[R_t^2] = \sigma^2 \times h
$$

- ( $\mu$  and  $\sigma$ , are the annualized expected log return and volatility)
- Consider now a put option with strike price  $K$  and maturity  $T$ .  
- The following trading strategy replicates the final payoff  $\max (K - S_T,0)$ .

# Option Premium by Dynamic Replication

1. At time 0:

(a) Short  $\Delta_0 = -N(-d_{1,0})$  of stocks

- Here  $N(x)$  is the standard normal cumulative density function, and  $d_{1,t}$  is

$$
d_{1,t} = \frac{\ln{(S_t / K)} + (r + \sigma^2 / 2)(T - t)}{\sigma \sqrt{T - t}}
$$

- $r$  is the continuously compounded risk free rate;  $\sigma$  is the volatility of stock returns.

(b) Buy an amount  $B_{0} = K \times e^{-r \times T} \times N(-d_{2,0})$  of Treasury Zero Coupon bonds.

Here  $d_{2,0} = d_{1,t} - \sigma \times \sqrt{T}$  

- The portfolio so constructed has value at time 0

$$
P _ {0} = B _ {0} + \Delta_ {0} S _ {0}
$$

- (it can be shown  $P_{0} > 0$ ).

2. From now on, rebalance the portfolio, to make sure that at every  $t$ , the portfolio has a position in stocks given by  $\Delta_t = -N(-d_{1,t})$

- E.g. if  $S_{t} \downarrow \Rightarrow \Delta_{t} \downarrow \Rightarrow$  short more stocks and put proceeds into bonds  $\Rightarrow B_{t} \uparrow$ .  
- Or if  $S_{t} \uparrow \Longrightarrow \Delta_{t} \uparrow \Longrightarrow$  buy back stocks by liquidating some bonds  $\Longrightarrow B_{t} \downarrow$ .

# Option Premium by Dynamic Replication

- For instance, let  $S = K = 100$ ,  $T = 1$ ,  $r = 5\%$ ,  $\sigma = 20\%$ . Then,

$$
d _ {1} = . 3 5; d _ {2} = . 1 5; N (- d _ {1}) = 0. 3 6 3 2; N (- d _ {2}) = 0. 4 4 0 4 \Longrightarrow \Delta_ {0} = - N (- d _ {1}) = - 0. 3 6 3 2
$$

- Initial short position in stocks: \(\Delta \times 100 = -N(d_{1}) \times 100 = -0.3632 \times 100 = -\\)36.32.\(
- Initial bond position: \(B_{0} = Ke^{-rT}N(-d_{2}) = \\)41.89.\(
- Initial value of the portfolio: \(P_{0} = B_{0} + \Delta_{0}S_{0} = \\)41.89 - \\(36.32 = \$5.57\(
- One day later ( $h = 1/252 = 1$  day) the stock is  $S_{h} = 99 \Rightarrow \Delta_{h} = -N(-d_{1,h}) = -.3821$
- Need to short more, and thus sell  $|\Delta_h - \Delta_0| = |-.3821 - (-0.3632)| = 0.0189$  shares.  
- Obtain cash = 0.0189 × 99 = \$1.879, and put it in bonds:

New Bond Position  $= B_{h} = B_{0}\times e^{r\times h} + \\$ 1.879 = \$41.89 - \$ 1.879 = \$43.777

New Portfolio Position = \(P_{h} = B_{h} + \Delta_{h}\times S_{h} = \\)43.777 - .3821\times 99 = \\(5.941\$

# Option Premium by Dynamic Replication

- Fact: The portfolio  $P_{t} = \Delta_{t}S_{t} + B_{t}$  obtained from the above trading strategy replicates the put option payoff.
- That is, at maturity

$$
P _ {T} = \Delta_ {T} S _ {T} + B _ {T} = \max (K - S _ {T}, 0)
$$

- Proof by simulation: Next two figures show that the strategy works, even when portfolio rebalancing is at daily interval  $(h = 1 / 252)$ .
- I simulate stock price paths. And then performed the above trading strategy.

Replicating Portfolio and Black and Scholes Price

# Black and Scholes Formula

- Since portfolio  $P_{t}$  replicates the payoff of the put option, the value of the portfolio at any time must equal the value of the put option.
- Why?  
- Arbitrage: "Buy Cheap / Sell Dear".  
- For instance, if  $P_{t} <$  Put Option Premium  $\Longrightarrow$

1. Sell option and set up the replicating portfolio (which costs  $P_{t}$ )  
2. Today make (Put Option Premium  $-P_{t}) > 0$  
3. At maturity  $T$  the replicating portfolio provides the payoff, exactly.

- In particular, at time 0, the value of the option must be

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {P u t P r e m i u m a t 0 ,} p _ {0} = P _ {0} = B _ {0} + \Delta_ {0} \times S _ {0} \\ = K \times e ^ {- r T} \times N (- d _ {2, 0}) - S _ {0} \times N (- d _ {1, 0}) \\ \end{array}
$$

- This is the celebrated "Black and Scholes" formula for option pricing.
- Similarly, a call option formula is given by

$$
\mathrm {C a l l P r e m i u m a t 0 ,} c _ {0} = S _ {0} \times N (d _ {1, 0}) - K \times e ^ {- r T} \times N (d _ {2, 0})
$$

# Delta Hedging and Dynamic Replication

- Why does the dynamic replication strategy work?
- Suppose you sold a put option and decide to hedge using the replicating portfolio  $P$ .  
- Let  $\Pi$  be the portfolio short the put  $(-p)$  and long the replicating portfolio

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Pi = - p + P \\ {\bf \Pi} = {\bf \Pi} - p + \Delta S + B \\ \end{array}
$$

- What is the sensitivity of  $\Pi$  to small variations in stocks?

$$
\frac {d \Pi}{d S} = - \frac {d p}{d S} + \Delta \times 1 + 0
$$

- The portfolio  $\Pi$  is delta hedged ( $d\ \Pi / d\ S = 0$ ) if

$$
\Delta = \frac {d p}{d S}
$$

- It can be shown that indeed  $\Delta = -N(-d_{1})$  is exactly  $d p / d S$
- This implies that for every small variation in stock  $S$ , the portfolio and the option move exactly by the same amount.
- $\Longrightarrow$  the dynamic replication works.

# Delta Hedging and Dynamic Replication

- The next figure shows the dynamic replication at work in a graph:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/f0e60057-2959-4ddd-a00e-1944e3342895/0f2a5c183d9687c52620781157024ea825199d15db5ce7abbf4df8694f3a0b02.jpg)

# Black and Scholes Formula

- Example: Consider an at-the-money option.
- The stock price is  $S = 100$ , the strike price is  $K = 100$ , the (continuously compounded) interest rate is  $r = 5\%$ , maturity is  $T = 1$ , and the return volatility  $\sigma = 30\%$ .
- We then have

$$
d _ {1} = \frac {\log \left(\frac {S}{K}\right) + (r - \delta + \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}} = \frac {\log \left(\frac {1 0 0}{1 0 0}\right) + (. 0 5 + (0 . 3 0) ^ {2} / 2) \times 1}{0 . 3 0 \sqrt {1}} = 0. 3 1 6 7;
$$

$$
d _ {2} = d _ {1} - \sigma \sqrt {T} = 0. 3 1 6 7 -. 3 \sqrt {1} = 0. 0 1 6 7
$$

- Therefore  $N(d_{1}) = 0.62425$  and  $N(d_{2}) = 0.50665$ .  
- The value of the call option is

$$
c _ {0} = S N (d _ {1}) - K e ^ {- r T} N (d _ {2}) = 1 0 0 \times 0. 6 2 4 2 5 - 1 0 0 \times e ^ {. 0 5 \times 1} \times 0. 5 0 6 6 5 = 1 4. 2 3 1 2
$$

- The value of a put option can be computed from these data by recalling that

$$
N (- d _ {1}) = 1 - N (d _ {1}) = 0. 3 7 5 7 5; \quad N (- d _ {2}) = 1 - N (d _ {2}) = 0. 4 9 3 3 5
$$

so that

$$
p _ {0} = - S N (- d _ {1}) + K e ^ {- r T} N (- d _ {2}) = - 1 0 0 \times 0. 3 7 5 7 5 + 1 0 0 \times e ^ {. 0 5 \times 1} \times 0. 4 9 3 3 5 = 9. 3 5 4 2
$$

# The Binomial Tree and Black and Scholes Formula

- To interpret the Black and Scholes formula it is convenient to go back to binomial trees discussed in TN 4.  
- Black and Scholes model assumes continuous trading
  - That is, traders can trade at any instant  $t$  
- Moreover, stock prices can take on any value, and not only the values on a tree.  
- Both conditions are approximately met as we let the time interval  $h = T / n$  in the binomial tree go to zero.  
- Indeed, as we have seen, recall that we have the following:  
- Fact: As  $n$  goes to infinity, the Binomial Tree price converges to Black and Scholes price.  
- To see the similarity of Black and Scholes formula with the one stemming from a binomial tree, consider the following example.

# The Binomial Tree and Black and Scholes Formula

$$
i = 0
$$

$$
i = 1
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} {S _ {0}} \\ {c _ {0} = e ^ {- r \times T} E ^ {*} [ \max (S _ {1} - K, 0) ]} \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} {S _ {1, u} = S _ {0} \times u} \\ {c _ {1, u} = \max (S _ {1} - K, 0) = S _ {1} - K} \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} {S _ {1, d} = S _ {0} \times d} \\ {c _ {1, d} = \max (S _ {1} - K, 0) = 0} \end{array}
$$

- Consider  $i = 0$  and  $i = 1$  with  $S_{1,u} = S_0 \times u$  and  $S_{1,d} = S_0 \times d$ .  
- Assume the price of the option has  $S_{1,u} > K > S_{1,d}$ , so that the payoffs from the tree above result.  
- Let  $q^{*}$  be the risk neutral probability of going up in the tree.

# The Binomial Tree and Black and Scholes Formula

- The price of the option at time 0 according to risk neutral pricing is the

$$
\begin{array}{l} c _ {0} = e ^ {- r \times T} E ^ {*} [ \max (S _ {1} - K, 0) ] \\ = e ^ {- r \times T} \times [ q ^ {*} \times \max (S _ {1, u} - K, 0) + (1 - q ^ {*}) \times \max (S _ {1, d} - K, 0) ] \\ = e ^ {- r \times T} \times q ^ {*} \times (S _ {1, u} - K) \\ = S _ {0} \times e ^ {- r \times T} \times q ^ {*} \times u - e ^ {- r \times T} \times K \times q ^ {*} \\ = S _ {0} \times N _ {1} - e ^ {- r \times T} \times K \times N _ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

- where, defining by  $u_{cc}$  the annualized c.c. return from an up movement  $S_{1,u} / S_0 = e^{u_{cc}\times T} = u$

$$
N _ {1} = e ^ {- r \times T} \times q ^ {*} \times u = e ^ {(u _ {c c} - r) \times T} \times q ^ {*} \quad \mathrm {a n d} \quad N _ {2} = q ^ {*}
$$

- The similarity with Black and Scholes formula is not coincidental

$$
\mathrm {C a l l} = S \times N (d _ {1}) - K \times e ^ {- r T} \times N (d _ {2})
$$

- Interpretation:

$$
\begin{array}{l} - N _ {2} = N (d _ {2}) \mathrm {r i s k n e u t r a l p r o b a b i l i t y t o b e i n t h e m o n e y a t m a t u r i t y}; \\ - N _ {1} = N (d _ {1}) \mathrm {r i s k n e u t r a l e x p e c t e d e x c e s s r e t u r n c o n d i t i o n a l o n e x e r c i s e a t} T. \\ \end{array}
$$

# The Binomial Tree and Black and Scholes Formula

- Indeed, recall we obtained the following formula in TN 4 for a large number of steps  $n$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l} c _ {0} = e ^ {- r T} E ^ {*} [ \max (S _ {T} - K, 0) ] \\ = e ^ {- r \times T} \sum_ {j = 0} ^ {n} \left(\frac {n !}{j ! (n - j) !}\right) \max (S _ {T, j} - K, 0) \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $S_{T,j} = S_0\times u^{(n - j)}\times d^j$  

- Let  $a$  be the smallest integer for which  $S_{T,j} > K$  for  $j \geq a$ , and  $S_{T,j} < K$  for  $j < a$ .  
- Putting all together:

$$
\begin{array}{l} c _ {0} = e ^ {- r \times T} \sum_ {j = a} ^ {n} \left(\frac {n !}{j ! (n - j) !}\right) (S _ {T, j} - K) \\ = S _ {0} \times N _ {1} - K \times e ^ {- r \times T} \times N _ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\mathrm {w i t h} N _ {1} = \left(e ^ {- r \times T} \sum_ {j = a} ^ {n} \left(\frac {n !}{j ! (n - j) !}\right) \times u ^ {(n - j)} \times d ^ {j}\right) \quad \mathrm {a n d} N _ {2} = \sum_ {j = a} ^ {n} \left(\frac {n !}{j ! (n - j) !}\right)
$$

- It can be shown that  $N_{1} \to N(d_{1})$  and  $N_{2} \to N(d_{2})$  as  $n \to \infty$  
- The interpretation, though, is the same as in the simple 2-period model.

# Does the Dynamic Replication Strategy Work in Reality?

- Black and Scholes formula relies on dynamic replication. Does it actually work in reality?  
- Sometimes yes: e.g. Jan - Dec 2000
- Replication of S&P500 option with  $T = 1$  year.  $\sigma =$  standard deviation of returns in 1999.

Replicating Portfolio and Black and Scholes Price

- We will return on the empirical performance of Black and Scholes model in the next TNs.

# Black and Scholes Pricing Formula

- Like futures, simple modifications to the option specification can still be treated within the Black and Scholes framework.

# 1. Options with known dividend.

- Define  $S^{*} = S - PV(D)$  where  $PV(D) = \text{Present Value of Dividends before Expiration}$ .  
- Use Black and Scholes formula with  $S^*$  instead of  $S$ .

# 2. Options with known dividend yield  $q$ .

- Define  $S^{*} = S \times e^{-q \times T}$  and use Black and Scholes formula as usual.

$$
c = S e ^ {- q T} N (d _ {1}) - K e ^ {- r T} N (d _ {2}); \quad p = K e ^ {- r T} N (- d _ {2}) - S e ^ {- q T} N (- d _ {1})
$$

$$
d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (S / K) + (r - q + \sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}; d _ {2} = d _ {1} - \sigma \sqrt {T}
$$

# 3. Options on currencies

- When you buy foreign currency, you would invest in foreign Treasuries. Thus,  $r_{foreign}$  is a dividend yield. Apply previous formula with  $q = r_{foreign}$ .

# Black and Scholes Pricing Formula

# 4. Futures Options

- Entering into a futures position does not cost anything. Thus, compared to the dynamic replication with stocks, a trader would save the riskless rate.  
- The option pricing formula is then Black and Scholes formula in which the futures price  $F$  is used instead of  $S$ , but the "dividend yield" equals the risk free rate  $q = r$ .  
- Substituting this in the previous formula:

$$
c = e ^ {- r T} [ F N (d _ {1}) - K N (d _ {2}) ]; \quad p = e ^ {- r T} [ K N (- d _ {2}) - F N (- d _ {1}) ]
$$

$$
d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (F / K) + (\sigma^ {2} / 2) T}{\sigma \sqrt {T}}; d _ {2} = d _ {1} - \sigma \sqrt {T}
$$

# Risks in Options and the Greeks

- Risk managers and traders need to control the sensitivity of options to changes in the underlying.  
- Terminology:

1. Delta: Sensitivity of option to changes in underlying

$$
\Delta = \frac {d \mathrm {O p t i o n P r i c e}}{d S} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} N (d _ {1}) & \mathrm {f o r C a l l s} \\ - N (- d _ {1}) & \mathrm {f o r P u t s} \end{array} \right.
$$

2. Gamma: Sensitivity of Delta  $\Delta$  to changes in the underlying. For both calls and puts:

$$
\Gamma = \frac {d \Delta}{d S} = \frac {N ^ {\prime} (d _ {1})}{S \sigma \sqrt {T}} \quad \mathrm {w i t h} N ^ {\prime} (x) = \frac {e ^ {- x ^ {2}} 2}{\sqrt {2 \pi}}
$$

- $\Longrightarrow$ $\Gamma =$  curvature of option price with respect to stock  $S$ ;

Put Option Profile versus Payoff at T

# Risks in Options and the Greeks

- Why for a put option  $\Theta > 0$  for low  $S$  and  $\Theta < 0$  for high  $S$ ?
- For  $S$  high, payoff is zero, but put price is positive.

* $\Longrightarrow$  As time passes (but keeping  $S$  fixed), the put price must decline.

- For  $S$  low, why is  $\Theta > 0$ ?

* Simple example: the firm goes bankrupt  $\Longrightarrow S = 0$ .  
$\ast \Longrightarrow$  Put payoff at  $T = K$  
* Value at time  $t < T$  is  $p = e^{-r(T - t)}K$ , which increases with  $t$ .

- What about call options?
- For non-dividend paying stock,  $\Theta < 0$  for call options.

* If  $S$  is very very high, option holder will receive  $S - K$  at maturity (with high probability)  
* This is the payoff of a long forward, so present value at  $t < T$  is  $c = S - Ke^{-rT} > S - K$

- Intuition: for calls, we will pay  $K$ , whose present value today is smaller than  $K$ , pushing up the price of the call.
- If the stock pays (a lot of) dividends, then  $\Theta > 0$  for high  $S$ , as the option holder misses the dividend payout during the life of the option (compared to a stock holder).

Call Option Profile versus Payoff at T with high dividend yield

# Risks in Options and the Greeks

- In Black and Scholes model, the volatility  $\sigma$  and the interest rate  $r$  are constant.  
- However, it is interesting how does a change in  $\sigma$  and  $r$  change the value of the option.

4. Rho: Change in option price due to a change in interest rate  $r$

$$
\mathrm {R h o} = \frac {d \mathrm {O p t i o n P r i c e}}{d r} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} K T e ^ {- r T} N (d _ {2}) > 0 & \mathrm {f o r C a l l s} \\ - K T e ^ {- r T} N (- d _ {2}) <   0 & \mathrm {f o r P u t s} \end{array} \right.
$$

- Intuition: it all depends on whether the option holder will pay  $K$  (call) or receive  $K$  (put). The PV of  $K$  declines as  $r$  increases, yielding the result.

5. Vega: Change in option price due to a change in volatility  $\sigma$

$$
\mathrm {V e g a} = \frac {d \mathrm {O p t i o n P r i c e}}{d \sigma} = S \sqrt {T} N ^ {\prime} (d _ {1}) > 0

# Example of Risk Management Problem

- Assume today is Feb 22, 2008 and you sold the following Capital Protected Note:
- Maturity: February 20, 2015  
 - Issue Price: \$10  
- Principal: \$10  
- Interest: 0  
- Principal Protection:  $100\%$  
- Payoff at maturity: Principal plus Supplemental Redemption Amount (SRA), if positive.

$$
S R A = \$ 10 \times 116 \% \times \frac {\text {Final Index Value} - \text {Initial Index Value}}{\text {Initial Index Value}}
$$

- Index : S&P 500, renormalized to have Initial Index Value = \$10.
- If you sell this security, then you must protect your position against increases in the stock price.
- $\Longrightarrow$  Delta-hedge  $\Longrightarrow$  need to set up the replicating portfolio.

The Capital Protected Note's Payoff

# The Capital Protected Note's Payoff

- The Capital Protected Note's payoff can be decomposed into

1. A zero coupon bond with principal \(10 and maturity \(T = 7\).  
2. 1.16 at-the-money call options on the (normalized) S&P 500 with maturity  $T = 7$ .

- The reference index is normalized so that  $S_0 = \beta \times S \& P500 = \$ 10$ .  
- On Feb 28, 2008, we had S&P 500 = 1353.1.  $\Rightarrow \beta = 10 / 1353.1$ .
- Other data on Feb 28, 2008, are as follows
- The 7-year (c.c.) interest rate was  $r = 3.23\%$ .  
- The dividend yield of SP500 is  $\delta = 2\%$ .
- Let the volatility forecast over 7-year be  $\sigma = 15\%$  
- The value of the security is

$$
\begin{array}{l} V a l u e = e ^ {- r T} \S 1 0 + 1. 1 6 \times C a l l (1 0, 1 0, r, \delta , \sigma , T) \\ = \$ 7. 9 7 6 4 + 1. 1 6 \times \$ 1. 7 \\ = \$ 9. 9 4 8 3 \\ \end{array}
$$

- Close to \$10  
- Note that an investor in CPN trades off coupons for 1.16 call options.

# Delta Hedging at time 0

- How can we hedge the short CPN?  
- Theoretically, we just need a position in the replicating portfolio:

1. Buy a zero coupon bond today for \(7.9764 (to hedge the "bond" component)  
2. Purchase 1.16 units of the replicating portfolio for the (embedded) call option.

- The replicating portfolio for each call is as follows:
- Given the call  $\Delta = e^{-\delta T}N(d_1) = 0.5747$ , we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {P o s i t i o n i n (n o r m a l i z e d) S \& P 5 0 0 = 0 . 5 7 4 7 ;} \\ \mathrm {B o n d P o s i t i o n} = C a l l (1 0, 1 0, r, \delta , \sigma , T) - \Delta \times S _ {0} \\ = 1. 7 - \Delta \times 1 0 = - 4. 0 4 7 \\ \end{array}
$$

- That is, for each call option, invest  $0.5747 \times \$10 = 5.747$  in stock and borrow  $\$ 4.047$ .

Value of Replicating Portfolio  $= 0.5747 \times 10 - 4.047 = 1.7$

- Multiply the positions above by 1.16 and we obtain the replicating portfolio for a CPN.

# Dynamic Delta Hedging

- Theoretically, if we rebalance frequently the position in stocks, the portfolio will replicate exactly the payoff the structured derivative.
- If  $S_{t}$  increases,  $\Delta$  increases and we must borrow more to invest more in stocks (how much?);  
- If  $S_{t}$  decreases,  $\Delta$  decreases and we sell some stocks and use the proceeds to repay some of the loan.

# Delta-Gamma Hedging

- There are some issues with delta-hedging

1. For any small variation in stock price we need to rebalance the portfolio  $-\Rightarrow$  with transaction costs this is expensive.  
2. Large variations in the stock price imply the hedge does not work too well.

- We can alleviate somewhat these problems by "Delta-Gamma" hedging:
- In addition to stocks, we need a position in a security with positive Gamma, such as a short-term traded option.
- Consider a portfolio  $\Pi$  which is short the  $T$ -dated call  $Call(S, T)$  (as the one implicit in the CPN), long  $N$  stock and long also  $N^c$  of  $T_1$ -date calls  $Call(S, T_1)$

$$
\Pi = - C a l l (S, T) + N \times S + N ^ {c} \times C a l l (S, T _ {1})
$$

- We want to hedge both the sensitivity of  $\Pi$  to changes in the stock  $\left(\frac{d\Pi}{dS} = 0\right)$  and the change in such sensitivity to changes in the stock, that is, the convexity

$$
\frac {d \left(\frac {d \Pi}{d S}\right)}{d S} = \frac {d \Pi^ {2}}{d S ^ {2}} = 0
$$

Delta Hedging: The Capital Protected Note

# Delta-Gamma Hedging

- The Delta-Gamma hedge then requires:

$$
\frac {d \Pi}{d S} = 0 \Longrightarrow - \frac {d C a l l (S , T)}{d S} + N + N ^ {c} \times \frac {d C a l l (S , T _ {1})}{d S} = 0 \qquad (\mathrm {D e l t a H e d g i n g})
$$

$$
\frac {d ^ {2} \Pi}{d S ^ {2}} = 0 \Longrightarrow - \frac {d ^ {2} C a l l (S , T)}{d S ^ {2}} + N ^ {c} \times \frac {d ^ {2} C a l l (S , T _ {1})}{d S ^ {2}} = 0 \qquad (\mathrm {G a m m a H e d g i n g})
$$

- Using the notation  $\Delta(S, T)$  and  $\Gamma(S, T)$  to indicate the Delta and Gamma of the option with maturity  $T$ , solving the two equations in two unknowns we obtain:

$$
N ^ {c} = \frac {\Gamma (S , T)}{\Gamma (S , T _ {1})}; N = \Delta (S, T) - N ^ {c} \times \Delta (S, T _ {1})
$$

- Note that the position in stocks is smaller (if  $N^c > 0$ ) than in the case of only Delta-hedging, as we now have to also hedge the position in the short-term call option, which is used to hedge against Gamma.

# Delta-Gamma Hedging: The Capital Protected Note

- For instance, using a 1-year option to hedge the CPN, we have

$$
C a l l (S, T) = 1. 7; \Gamma (S, T) = 0. 0 8 0 1 6; \Delta (S, T) = 0. 5 7 4 7
$$

$$
C a l l (S, T _ {1}) = 0. 6 4 4 3; \quad \Gamma (S, T _ {1}) = 0. 2 5 7 5; \quad \Delta (S, T _ {1}) = 0. 5 5 1 2
$$

we obtain

$$
\mathrm {P o s i t i o n i n s h o r t - t e r m c a l l} = N ^ {c} = 0. 3 1 1 3;
$$

$$
\mathrm {P o s i t i o n i n s t o c k} = N = 0. 4 0 3 1;
$$

$$
\mathrm {P o s i t i o n i n b o n d s} = 1. 7 - N \times S - N ^ {c} \times C a l l (S, T _ {1}) = - 2. 5 3 1 5
$$

- Next figure plots the CPN for various stock prices, along with the Delta hedge portfolio and the Delta-Gamma hedge portfolio.

Delta-Gamma Hedging: The Capital Protected Note

# Delta-Gamma Hedging: The Capital Protected Note

- The Delta-Gamma hedging strategy allows for larger swings in the stock price before calling for a rebalancing.  
- For instance, under Delta hedging, we need rebalance to when  $S < 9$  or  $S > 11$ , as the dashed line starts diverging from solid line.  
- Instead, Delta-Gamma requires rebalancing only when  $S < 8$  or  $S > 13$ , as the dotted line is very close to the solid line for a much wider range of prices.  
- Less frequent rebalancing implies lower transaction costs.  
- Of course, now we have more transaction costs because we have to rebalance also the  $T_{1}$ -option positions.  
- We need to use very liquid, exchange traded securities to minimize transaction costs on options.  
- Note that the additional benefit of the strategy is that large sudden changes in the stock price (plus/minus  $20\%$ ) are hedged.  
- A curiosity: From the figure, the CPN is valued at  \$8 for S low. In what sense this is a “capital protected note”? If the investor sells the security when S is low, he/she would not recover\$ 10.

# Options' Beta and Expected Returns

- We know that  $\Delta = N(d_{1})$  is the sensitivity of a call option price to changes in the stock price

$$
\frac {d \mathrm {C a l l}}{d S} = N (d _ {1})
$$

- What is the percentage sensitivity of the call price to percentage change in the stock price?

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\% \mathrm {age} \text {Change in Call}}{\% \mathrm {agee} \text {Change in Stock}} = \frac {\left(\frac {d \mathrm {Call}}{\mathrm {Call}}\right)}{\left(\frac {d S}{S}\right)} \\ = \frac {S}{\mathrm {C a l l}} \times \frac {d \mathrm {C a l l}}{d S} \\ = \frac {S}{\mathrm {C a l l}} \times N (d _ {1}) \\ = \frac {S N (d _ {1})}{S N (d _ {1}) - K e ^ {- r T} N (d _ {2})} \\ > 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

- $\Rightarrow$  In percentage, call options move more than the underlying stock

# Options' Beta and Expected Returns

What is the risk premium on an option?  

- Recall that a call option is given by a portfolio of stocks and bonds

$$
\mathrm {C a l l} = \Delta \times S + B
$$

- As for any portfolio,

Return on a portfolio  $=$  weighted average of the returns of the individual assets

- where the weights are given by relative positions in the assets.
- That is, let  $R_C$  be the return on the call,  $R_S$  the return on stock, and  $R_B$  the return on bonds over a small interval of time

$$
R _ {C} = w \times R _ {S} + (1 - w) \times R _ {B}
$$

where the weight on stock is

$$
w = \frac {\text {Position in Stock}}{\text {Value of Portfolio}} = \frac {\Delta \times S}{\text {Call}} = \frac {\% \text {age Change in Call}}{\% \text {agee Change in Stock}}
$$

# Options' Beta and Expected Returns

- If  $S$  is the aggregate market (e.g. S&P500), then we can think of  $w$  as the Call Option's Beta.  
- Developing the return equation and using also the notation  $w = \beta$ , we obtain

$$
(R _ {C} - R _ {B}) = \beta \times (R _ {S} - R _ {B})
$$

# Options' Beta and Expected Returns

- Given such large  $\beta$ , the excess return on a call option is much larger than the one on the stock.  
- A call option is effectively a Leveraged Investment
- We borrow  $(B)$  to purchase  $(\Delta)$  stock with minimum equity investment (Call)  
- $\Longrightarrow$  Expected Excess Return is very high:  $E\left[R_{C} - R_{B}\right] = \beta \times E\left[R_{S} - R_{B}\right]$  
- Note that  $\beta$  depends on  $S$ , so it is not constant.
- Clearly, the risk is also very high. What is the variance of call option returns?
- It is  $\beta^2 \times$  variance of stock returns:  $\sigma_C^2 = \beta^2 \times \sigma_S^2$

Example: Volatility of 4000 Call Expiring on 12/17/2021

- The volatility of the call option, computed as the 22-day standard deviation of returns, is much higher than the one of the SP500 index.

# The Risk / Return Characteristics of Options

- The Risk / Return characteristics of an investment is often measured by the Sharpe Ratio

$$
\mathrm {S h a r p e R a t i o} = \frac {\mathrm {E x p e c t e d E x c e s s R e t u r n}}{\mathrm {V o l a t i l i t y}}
$$

- The Sharpe Ratio of a Call option is therefore

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {S h a r p e R a t i o o f C a l l} = \frac {\mathrm {E x p e c t e d E x c e s s R e t u r n C a l l}}{\mathrm {V o l a t i l i t y C a l l}} \\ = \frac {E [ R _ {C} - R _ {B} ]}{\sigma_ {C}} \\ = \frac {\beta E [ R _ {S} - R _ {B} ]}{\beta \sigma_ {S}} \\ = \mathrm {S h a r p e R a t i o o f S t o c k} \\ \end{array}
$$

- The Sharpe Ratio is the same as the one of stocks (theoretically, at least)
