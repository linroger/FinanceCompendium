# Financial Instruments Observations about CDS

John Heaton

The University of Chicago

Booth School of Business

# Types of CDS, Quantities

# Types

- Single-name CDS: single reference entity such as a corporation or sovereign  
- Multi-name CDS: cover defaults in a reference portfolio such as a basic credit default swap or a CDS index (typically an index of commonly negotiated single-name CDS)

# Quantities:

- From BIS (2021): $8.5 trillion notional at end of 2020. 1.5% of notional of all global derivatives.  
- GFC likely reduced size we see even today  
- $62\%$  now with central counterparties that act like exchanges.  
- Increased size of sovereign CDS since GFC:  $4\%$  of total notional in 2007 to  $14\%$  in 2020.
