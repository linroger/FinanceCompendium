# Black and Scholes Model: Does it Work?

- Does the Black and Scholes model yield option prices similar to the market price of traded options?  
- On October 31:
- The S&P 500 index was  $S = 3871.98$  and the one month risk free rate was  $r = 3.75\%$  (c.c).  
- The dividend yield on the S&P500 is about  $q = 1.69\%$ .  
- Observed options prices with maturity end of November  $T = 1 / 12$ .

# Black and Scholes Model: Does it Work?

- Moneyness: is defined as the ratio of the strike price to the current stock price  $K / S$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Rightarrow K / S <   1 \Rightarrow K <   S \Rightarrow \mathrm {p u t s a r e O T M}, \mathrm {c a l l s a r e I T M} \\ \Rightarrow K / S > 1 \Rightarrow K > S \Rightarrow \mathrm {p u t s a r e I T M}, \mathrm {c a l l s a r e O T M} \\ \end{array}
$$

# Black and Scholes Model: Does it Work?

- Let's compare to Black Scholes using historical volatility of  $22.2\%$ .

# Black and Scholes Model: Does it Work?

BSM put prices relative to observed prices. This time with volatility set to match the "ATM" put option with strike of 3870. This "implied volatility" was  $23.1\%$ .

# Black and Scholes: What is wrong?

- Black and Scholes assume log-normal returns
- That is,  $r_{S} = \log \left(\left(S_{t + h} + \text{dividends}\right) / S_{t}\right)$  is normally distributed.
- Figure 1 plots the empirical distribution of monthly returns and the normal distribution

$\Longrightarrow$  Fat Tails: Extreme observations more likely than implied by normal.

# Black and Scholes: What is wrong?

- The Black and Scholes model assumes that the volatility of stock returns is constant.  
- But volatility is in fact Stochastic: It moves unpredictability over time.

# Black and Scholes: What is wrong?

- The Black and Scholes model assumes that trading is continuous, and prices do not jump.  
- But prices sometimes jump discretely to other levels.

# Black and Scholes Implied Volatility

- Implied Volatility: The level of volatility  $\sigma$  that once inserted in Black and Scholes formula, it matches the value of a traded option.  
- For instance, let  $put^{mkt}(K,T)$  be a traded put price at strike price  $K$  and time to maturity  $T$ . - E.g. on October 31,  $put^{mkt}(3870,1/12) = \$98.50$  
- Define:

$$
\sigma_ {I m p} \quad \mathrm {i s c h o s e n s u c h t h a t} \quad p u t ^ {m k t} (K, T) = B S P (S _ {0}, K, T, r, q, \sigma_ {I m p})
$$

- The implied volatility for this option was  $23.1\%$  
- Note:
- Every option has a potentially different implied volatility  $\sigma_{Imp}$ .

Implied Volatility Smile (or, Smirk)

# Black and Scholes Implied Volatility

- Uses of Implied Volatility:
- Gauge the general market uncertainty about future returns.

* Higher uncertainty  $\Longrightarrow$  higher option prices  $\Longrightarrow$  higher implied volatility.  
* It augments return volatility itself, as implied volatility is Forward Looking

# VIX

NOTE: the VIX uses the concept of "Volatility Swaps" where one creates a portfolio of options that is hedged against index level moves but is only exposed to volatility changes. Technically it is not an "implied volatility" as in the B-S-M model.

# Black and Scholes Implied Volatility

- Uses of Implied Volatility:
- Gauge the relative pricing of options.

* It is hard to compare prices with different strike prices or maturities.

- Different strike prices  $\Longrightarrow$  different intrinsic values  $S_{0} - K$  
- Different maturities  $\Longrightarrow$  different time value of money and uncertainty.

Option Prices across Strike Prices and maturitirs

* E.g. on May 3, 2007, put $mkt$ 1500,.12) =  $\$ 20.35$  while put $mkt$ 1475,.12) =  $\$ 12.60$ .

- Is the 7.75 dollar difference only due to the 25 dollar difference in strike prices, or "something else"?

# Black and Scholes Implied Volatility

- Using implied volatilities helps eliminating differences in intrinsic values and maturities.  
- $\Longrightarrow$  implied volatility is a simple measure of how expensive options are relative to each other.
- Implied Volatility Surface = Implied volatilities across strikes and maturities.

# Black and Scholes Model: Shall we throw it away?

- No: it is a useful benchmark.  
- It still works reasonably well to hedge against changes in stock prices
- Recall the Delta Hedging in Teaching Notes 5.
- New models have been proposed to deal with the shortcomings of Black and Scholes models.
- Deterministic and Stochastic Volatility Models

* Take into account that volatility is in fact time varying.

- Models with Price Jumps

* Take into account that jumps may occur

- Implied Tree Models

* Find the trees that actually price options

- All of these models imply that put prices are overpriced because investors seeking protection from downside (e.g. jumps) are willing to pay a larger (insurance) premium.

# Deterministic Volatility Models

- Assume that volatility  $\sigma$  depends on the stock price itself.  
- E.g. Constant Elasticity of Variance model:  $\sigma(S) = \Sigma \times S^{\alpha}$

$$
\log \left(\frac {S _ {t , t + h}}{S _ {t}}\right) = \mu \times h + S _ {t} ^ {\alpha} \times \Sigma \times \epsilon_ {t}
$$

- If  $\alpha < 0$ , a lower  $S_{t}$  implies a higher volatility.  
$\bullet \Longrightarrow$  implied volatility smirk

# Stochastic Volatility Models

- Assume that volatility  $\sigma_{t}$  is moving over time.  
E.g. let  $\sigma_t = \sqrt{v_t}$

$$
R _ {t, t + h} = \mu \times h + \sqrt {v _ {t}} \times \epsilon_ {1, t}
$$

$$
\left(v _ {t + h} - v _ {t}\right) = k \times \left(\overline {{v}} - v _ {t}\right) \times h + \Sigma \times \sqrt {v _ {t}} \times \epsilon_ {2, t}
$$

- (It is hard to ensure  $v_{t} > 0$  for every  $t$  unless interval size  $h$  is very small)
- Result: if volatility is negatively correlated with stock returns, OTM put options become relatively more expensive  $\Longrightarrow$  Volatility Smirk  
- Intuition:
- A decline in price  $\Rightarrow$  higher volatility  $\Rightarrow$  higher probability of even larger declines  $\Rightarrow$  higher price of insurance against downturns.

# Jump in Prices

- Assume that sometimes big changes in stock prices occur (e.g. October 1987)

$$
R _ {t, t + h} = \mu \times h + \sigma \times \epsilon_ {t} + \omega \times Q _ {t}
$$

- where  $Q_{t} = 0$  most of the time, but some times  $Q_{t} = 1$  (with small probability)  
- $\omega$  can be a random variable (e.g. normal), or a constant.
- Result: If  $\omega < 0$  (or  $E[\omega] < 0$ ), then OTM put options are relatively more expensive.
- If  $\omega < 0$ , it becomes more likely that bad negative outcomes occur.  
- Investors willing to pay a higher premium to insure against those bad events.
- Pricing with jumps is particularly complicated.
- The pricing formulas are not as "nice" as the Black and Scholes formula.

# An Example of "Implied Tree"

- The idea is reasonably simple.  
- In Teaching Note 4, we learnt how to go from a tree to option prices.  
- The "implied tree" methodology does the opposite: Uses (some) option prices to obtain a tree.
- For instance, consider the binomial tree model in Teaching Note 4.  
- Given  $S_{0} = 1502.39$ ,  $\sigma = 12.36\%$ ,  $r = 4.713\%$ ,  $\delta = 1.91\%$  and  $T = .12$ , we find  $u = \exp(\sigma \sqrt{T}) = 1.043746137$  and  $d = 1 / u = 0.958087378$ . Thus, the risk neutral probability

$$
q ^ {*} = \frac {e ^ {(r - \delta) T} - d}{u - d} = 0. 5 2 8 6 3 1 1 1 3
$$

- The price of the \(K = 1500\) put option come out to be \(p_0 = \\)28.394\(, higher than the traded market price \(p^{mkt}(1500,.12) = \$20.35\).

# An Example of "Implied Tree"

$$
i = 0
$$

$$
i = 1
$$

$$
S _ {1, u} = 1 5 6 8. 1 1 4
$$

$$
p _ {1, u} = 0
$$

$$
S _ {0} = 1 5 0 2. 3 9
$$

$$
q _ {0} ^ {*} = 0. 5 2 8 6 3 1 1 1 3
$$

$$
p _ {0} = e ^ {- r \times 0. 1 2} \times (1 - q _ {0} ^ {*}) \times p _ {1, d} = 2 8. 3 9 4
$$

$$
S _ {1, d} = 1 4 3 9. 4 2 1
$$

$$
p _ {1, d} = 6 0. 5 7 9
$$

- An implied tree has the same logic of implied volatility: Since the model is not working using the correct inputs, we look for an alternative specification that makes it work.
- In the above example, we can choose  $S_{1,u}$  to price the option correctly.  
- To avoid too many parameters, define  $u = S_{1,u} / S_0$  and define  $S_{1,d} = S_0 / u$ .  
- We obtain the following

# An Example of "Implied Tree"

$$
i = 0
$$

$$
i = 1
$$

$$
S _ {1, u} = 1 5 5 1. 2 6
$$

$$
p _ {1, u} = 0
$$

$$
S _ {0} = 1 5 0 2. 3 9
$$

$$
q _ {0} ^ {*} = 0. 5 4 4 6
$$

$$
p _ {0} = e ^ {- r \times 0. 1 2} \times (1 - q _ {0} ^ {*}) \times p _ {1, d} = 2 0. 3 5
$$

$$
S _ {1, d} = 1 4 5 5. 0 5 9
$$

$$
p _ {1, d} = 4 4. 9 4 1
$$

- What do we use an implied tree for?
- To price other options. For instance, if K = 1490, the put price from the binomial tree is $15.82184291, closer to the market value of p^mkt(1490,.12) = $17.05, compared to the original case (which would be $23.707)  
- With more elaborated trees, one can also price more elaborated derivatives, which have path dependencies, or American features.

# An Example of 2-step "Implied Tree"

- Once we solved for the first step, we can proceed to obtain a two step tree - We need to keep the first step fixed though  
What do we choose?

$$
- S _ {2, u u}, S _ {2, u d} = S _ {2, d u} \mathrm {a n d} S _ {2, d d}.
$$

- It is desirable to keep the tree somewhat balanced around the starting value  $S_0$ .  
  - $\Rightarrow$  choose  $S_{2,ud} = S_{2,du} = S_0$  
- Since we have two price levels to choose, we need two options.  
- The following example has \(p^{mkt}(1450,.21) = \\)14.65\) and \(p^{mkt}(1550,.21) = \$ 50.2\)

- Stochastic Volatility  
- Jumps  
- Fat tails
- Black-Scholes formula still a very useful benchmark
- To first order, prices and hedge ratios are fine
- More complicated models fit the data better and can be used to set up arbitrage strategies
- Such models do perform better than Black-Scholes model, but gains are not very large
- Black-Scholes model has become the industry standard for traders to quote options
- Trading quotes are in "implied volatility" terms.  
- Implied volatility surfaces provide a simple way to gauge the relative value of options.
