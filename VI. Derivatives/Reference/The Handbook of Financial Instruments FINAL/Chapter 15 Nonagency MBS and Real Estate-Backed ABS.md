In Chapter 14, mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac are described. In this chapter, we will look at products backed by residential mortgages that are not issued by one of these entities. These products fall into two groups: nonagency MBS and asset-backed securities backed by residential mortgage loans (i.e., real estate-backed ABS).

The classification of a security as either a nonagency MBS or a real estate-backed ABS is not always clear. This is because there are securities in which the underlying collateral is mixed with various types of mortgage-related loans. That is, the collateral backing a deal may include collateral that is a combination of standard first-lien residential mortgages, second lien mortgages, as well as other products that we will describe in this chapter—home equity loans and manufactured housing loans. The Secu

Rities Data Corporation (SDC) has established criteria for classifying a mortgage product with mixed collateral as either a nonagency MBS or an ABS. The classification rule is as follows: If at issuance more than  $50\%$  of a deal consists of either manufactured housing loans, home equity loans, second mortgage loans, or home improvement loans, then the deal is classified as an ABS. For deals in which more than  $50\%$  of the loans are first liens, SDC uses a size test to classify the deal. If more than  $50\%$  of the aggregate principal balance of the loans have a loan balance of more than \ $200,000, the deal is classified as a nonagency MBS. A deal in which 50\%$  of the loans are first liens, but more than  $50\%$  of the aggregate principal balance of the loans is less than \200,000 is classified as an ABS.

# COLLATERAL FOR RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE-BACKED SECURITIES

Mortgage loans used as collateral for an agency security are conforming loans. That is, they must meet the underwriting standards of the agency. Exhibit 15.1 identifies traditional agency loan guidelines—loan size, documentation, loan-to-value ratio, property type, and credit score. The credit score is a measure of the applicant's ability to repay the loan and is discussed later in this chapter.

The collateral for a nonagency MBS consists of nonconforming loans. A loan may be nonconforming for one or more of the following reasons:

EXHIBIT 15.1 Traditional Agency Loan Guidelines

<table><tr><td>Conforming Factor</td><td>Conforming Guideline</td></tr><tr><td>Loan Size</td><td>Limit for one unit property is 300,700 as of Jan. 1, 2002</td></tr><tr><td>Documentation</td><td>Full documentation
·Verify income (VOI)
·Verify employment (VOE)
·Verify deposit (VOA)
·Appraisal</td></tr><tr><td>Ratios</td><td>28\% Mortgage payment/monthly income
36\% Total debt /monthly income</td></tr><tr><td>Loan-to-Value (LTV)</td><td>Maximum 80\% without private mortgage insurance</td></tr><tr><td>Property Type</td><td>Single-family</td></tr><tr><td>Credit Score</td><td>FICO score &gt;660</td></tr></table>

1. The mortgage balance exceeds the amount permitted by the agency.
2. The borrower characteristics fail to meet the underwriting standards established by the agency.
3. The loan characteristics fail to meet the underwriting standards established by the agency.
4. The applicant fails to provide full documentation as required by the agency.

There are alternative lending programs for borrowers seeking nonconforming loans for any of the above reasons. A mortgage loan that is nonconforming merely because the mortgage balance exceeds the maximum permitted by the agency guideline is called a jumbo loan.

With respect to the characteristics of the borrower, a loan may fail to qualify because the borrower's credit history (as measured by the FICO score) does not meet the underwriting standards or the payment-to-income (PTI) ratio exceeds the maximum permitted. Borrowers who do satisfy the underwriting standards with respect to borrower characteristics are referred to as A credit borrowers or prime borrowers. An Alternative A loan is a loan of an A credit borrower that has a mortgage balance that is below or above the amount necessary to be conforming, but for various reasons fails to qualify to meet the underwriting standards of either the agencies or originators of jumbo loans for one or more of the following reasons:

Limited/low documentation loans

Non-conforming ratio loans

Investor property loans

Second home/vacation property loans

Self employed/foreign national loans

Cash-out refinancing

B and C borrowers or sub-prime borrowers are borrowers who fail to satisfy the underwriting standards of the agencies because of borrower characteristics. These characteristics include credit history and maximum PTI. The loans are actually scaled by originators from B to D. Every originator establishes its own profiles for classifying a loan into a rating category.

A characteristic that may result in a loan failing to meet the underwriting standards is that the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio exceeds the maximum established by the agency or the loan is not a first-mortgage lien. There are lenders who specialize in loans that exceed the maximum LTV. These lending programs are sometimes referred to as 125 LTV programs because the lender may be willing to lend up to  $125\%$  of the appraised or market value of the property. Basically, the lender is making a consumer loan based on the credit of the borrower to the extent that the loan amount exceeds the appraised or market value. For this reason, lenders with 125 programs have limited these loans to A credit borrowers. Mortgage-related products in which the underlying loans are 125 LTV loans are considered part of the ABS market and are discussed later in this chapter when ABS are covered.

For borrowers seeking a loan that is not a first lien on the property, a consumer loan in the form of a home equity loan can be obtained. A growing number of home equity loans are now first liens. There are two types of home equity loans, closed-end and open-end loans. With closed-end home equity loans, the lender provides the proceeds at the closing and the borrower must make scheduled monthly payments to amortize the loan as with a standard mortgage loan. In an open-end home equity loan, the lender provides a line of credit and the borrower takes down the line as needed. Mortgage-related products backed by home equity loans are considered part of the ABS market and will be covered later in this chapter.

In assessing whether a loan qualifies for conforming classification, the agencies require documentation (verification) of the information provided in the loan application. These include documents to verify the PTI and the LTV. To verify the PTI, documents to verify income (e.g., pay stubs or tax returns) and employment are needed, as well as a credit report. To verify the LTV, a property appraisal report and documentation of the source of the down payment are required. Failure to provide adequate documentation will result in a loan failing to conform. There are originators who will provide a loan based on no documentation ("no-doc loan") or limited documentation ("low-doc loan") with respect to verification of income. The borrowers are not necessarily subprime borrowers. They may be self-employed individuals or owners of a business where the amount reported in tax returns or paid as income would not meet the PTI standard of the agencies. Originators of no-doc and low-doc loans rely on the collateral (by limiting the LTV to  $80\%$  or less) and verification of significant assets that can be used to make the mortgage payments.

# FICO Scoring System

Developed by Fair Isaacs & Company, FICO is a credit scoring system that is used by lenders in the credit card, auto, home equity, and home mortgage markets. The system was developed to use past credit data in order to determine the likelihood of an individual borrower default over the next two years. FICO scores are based on the following variables: previous credit history

current level of indebtedness length of credit history

number of new credit inquiries type of credit available

The range of FICO scores is from a low of 365 (highest risk) to a high of 840 (lowest risk). Freddie Mac uses FICO scores as an important component in its underwriting process. For example, Freddie Mac breaks all mortgage loans into the following three buckets:

<table><tr><td>Bucket</td><td>FICO Range</td><td>Underwriting Method</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>less than 620</td><td>Cautious review</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>620 to 660</td><td>Comprehensive review</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>greater than 660</td><td>Basic review</td></tr></table>

The review that is necessary to approve a mortgage application generally increases as FICO scores decline (that is, credit risk increases). This is the case since historically default experience increases as FICO scores decline. As shown below, according to Fair Issacs & Company, historical default experience increases as FICO scores decline:

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="5">FICO Score</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&lt;579</td><td>580-619</td><td>620-659</td><td>660-730</td><td>740+</td></tr><tr><td>\% Defaults</td><td>9.5\%</td><td>5.9\%</td><td>2.7\%</td><td>1.0\%</td><td>0.1\%</td></tr></table>

According to Standard & Poor's,  $75\%$  of the U.S. population has FICO scores above 660, while only  $25\%$  of the population has FICO scores below 660.

# PREPAYMENT CONVENTIONS

Dealers involved in the underwriting and market making of real estate-backed securities have developed prepayment models for these loans. Several firms have found that the key difference between the prepayment behavior of borrowers of nonconforming mortgages and conforming mortgages is the important role played by the credit characteristics of the borrower.

Borrower characteristics and the seasoning process must be kept in mind when trying to assess prepayments for a particular deal. In the pro spectus of an offering, a base-case prepayment assumption is made—the initial speed and the amount of time until the collateral is seasoned. Thus, the prepayment benchmark is issuer specific. The benchmark speed in the prospectus is called the prospectus prepayment curve or PPC. As with the PSA benchmark described in Chapter 14, slower or faster prepayment speeds are a multiple of the PPC. For example, the PPC for a particular nonagency deal might state the following:

… a  $100\%$  Prepayment Assumption assumes conditional prepayment rates of  $1.5\%$  per annum of the then-outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loans in the first month of the life of the loans and an additional  $0.5\%$  per annum in each month thereafter until month 20. Beginning in month 20,  $100\%$  Prepayment Assumption assumes a conditional prepayment rate of  $11\%$  per annum each month.

For this deal,  $100\%$  PPC,  $80\%$  PPC, and  $150\%$  PPC would then be as follows for the first 20 months:

<table><tr><td>Month</td><td>100\% PPC (\%)</td><td>80\% PPC (\%)</td><td>150\% PPC (\%)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.5</td><td>1.2</td><td>2.3</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>2.0</td><td>1.6</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2.5</td><td>2.0</td><td>3.8</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3.0</td><td>2.4</td><td>4.5</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3.5</td><td>2.8</td><td>5.3</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>4.0</td><td>3.2</td><td>6.0</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>4.5</td><td>3.6</td><td>6.8</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5.0</td><td>4.0</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5.5</td><td>4.4</td><td>8.3</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>6.0</td><td>4.8</td><td>9.0</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>6.5</td><td>5.2</td><td>9.8</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>7.0</td><td>5.6</td><td>10.5</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>7.5</td><td>6.0</td><td>11.3</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>8.0</td><td>6.4</td><td>12.0</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>8.5</td><td>6.8</td><td>12.8</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>9.0</td><td>7.2</td><td>13.5</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>9.5</td><td>7.6</td><td>14.3</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>10.0</td><td>8.0</td><td>15.0</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>10.5</td><td>8.4</td><td>15.8</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>11.0</td><td>8.8</td><td>16.5</td></tr></table>

Unlike the PSA prepayment benchmark, the PPC is not generic. By this it is meant that the PPC is issuer specific. In contrast, the PSA prepayment benchmark applies to any type of collateral issued by an agency for any type of loan design. This feature of the PPC is important for an investor to keep in mind when comparing the prepayment characteristics and investment characteristics of the collateral between issuers and issues (new and seasoned).

# NONAGENCY MBS

As with agency MBS, there are nonagency passthrough securities and nonagency CMOs. Agency CMOs are created from pools of passthrough securities. In the nonagency market, a CMO can be created from either a pool of passthroughs or unsecuritized mortgage loans. It is uncommon for nonconforming mortgage loans to be securitized as passthroughs and then the passthroughs carved up to create a CMO. Instead, in the nonagency market a CMO is carved out of mortgage loans that have not been securitized as passthroughs. Since a mortgage loan is commonly referred to as a whole loan, nonagency CMOs are commonly referred to as whole-loan CMOs. With a nonagency MBS there is no explicit or implicit government guarantee of payment of interest and principal as there is with an agency security. Thus, there is credit risk. The nationally recognized statistical rating organizations rate nonagency securities.

# Servicer Advances

The servicer is responsible for the collection of interest and principal, which is passed along to the trustee. The servicer also handles delinquencies and foreclosures. Typically, there will be a master servicer and subservicers. These entities play a critical role and in assessing the credit risk of a nonagency MBS; the rating agencies look carefully at the quality of the servicers.

When there is a delinquency by the homeowner, the investor in a nonagency MBS may or may not be affected. This depends on whether a servicer is required to make advances. Thus, the financial capacity of the servicer to make advances is critical. Typically, a back-up servicer is used just in case the master servicer cannot meet its obligation with respect to advances. The servicer recovers advances when delinquent payments are made or the property is foreclosed and proceeds received.

There are different forms of advancing: (1) mandatory advancing, (2) optional advancing, and (3) limited advancing. The strongest form from the investor's perspective is mandatory advancing wherein failure to advance by a servicer is an event of default. However, a servicer need not advance if it can show that there is not a strong likelihood of recovery of the amount advanced when the property is ultimately disposed of. In an optional or a voluntary advancing, the servicer is not legally obligated to advance so that failure to do so is not an event of default. In a limited advancing the issuer is obligated to advance, but the amount it must advance is limited.

# Collateral Risks

For an agency backed product, the investor is not concerned with defaults except to the extent that they increase prepayment. In a nonagency security, defaults may impact the issuer's ability to return principal and pay interest to a tranche. Losses can also result through (1) borrower bankruptcy, (2) borrower fraud, and (3) special hazard risk.

# Credit Enhancements

All nonagency securities are credit enhanced. Typically a double A or triple A rating is sought for the most senior tranche in a deal. The amount of credit enhancement necessary depends on rating agency requirements and is referred to as "sizing" the transaction. There are two general types of credit enhancement structures: external and internal. We describe each type in the following sections and also how the rating agencies determine the level of credit enhancement. The same credit enhancements are also included in real estate-backed ABS.

# External Credit Enhancements

External credit enhancements come in the form of third-party guarantees that provide for first loss protection against losses up to a specified level, for example,  $10\%$ . The most common forms of external credit enhancement are (1) a corporate guarantee, (2) a letter of credit, (3) pool insurance, and (4) bond insurance.

Pool insurance policies cover losses resulting from defaults and foreclosures. Policies are typically written for a dollar amount of coverage that continues in force throughout the life of the pool. However, some policies are written so that the dollar amount of coverage declines as the pool seasons as long as two conditions are met: (1) the credit performance is better than expected and (2) the rating agencies that rated the issue approve. Since only defaults and foreclosures are covered, additional insurance must be obtained to cover losses resulting from bankruptcy (i.e., court mandated modification of mortgage debt—"cramdown"), fraud arising in the origination process, and special hazards (i.e., losses resulting from events not covered by a standard homeowner's insurance policy).

Bond insurance provides the same function as in municipal bond structures. Typically, bond insurance is not used as the primary protection but to supplement other forms of credit enhancement.

A nonagency security with external credit support is subject to the credit risk of the third-party guarantor (called event risk). Should the third-party guarantor be downgraded, the issue itself could be subject to downgrade even if the structure is performing as expected.

External credit enhancements do not materially alter the cash flow characteristics of a CMO structure except in the form of prepayment. In case of a default resulting in net losses within the guarantee level, investors will receive the principal amount as if a prepayment has occurred. If the net losses exceed the guarantee level, investors will realize a shortfall in the cash flows.

# Internal Credit Enhancements

Internal credit enhancements come in more complicated forms than external credit enhancements and may alter the cash flow characteristics of the loans even in the absence of default. The most common forms of internal credit enhancements are reserve funds, overcollateralization, and senior/ subordinated structures.

Reserve Funds Reserve funds come in two forms, cash reserve funds and excess servicing spread. Cash reserve funds are straight deposits of cash generated from issuance proceeds. In this case, part of the underwriting profits from the deal are deposited into a fund which typically invests in money market instruments. Cash reserve funds are typically used in conjunction with some form of external credit enhancement.

Excess servicing spread accounts involve the allocation of excess spread or cash into a separate reserve account after paying out the net coupon, servicing fee, and all other expenses on a monthly basis. For example, suppose that the gross weighted average coupon (gross WAC) is  $7.75\%$ , the servicing and other fees are  $0.25\%$ , and the net weighted average coupon (net WAC) is  $7.25\%$ . This means that there is excess spread of  $0.25\%$ . The amount in the reserve account will gradually increase and can be used to pay for possible future losses. This form of credit enhancement relies on the assumption that defaults occur infrequently in the very early life of the loans, but gradually increase in the following two to five years.

Overcollateralization The total par value of the tranches is the liability of the structure. So, if a structure has two tranches with a par value of 300 million, then that is the amount of the liability. The amount of the collateral backing the structure must be at least equal to the amount of the liability. If the amount of the collateral exceeds the amount of the liability of the structure, the deal is said to be overcollateralized. The amount of overcollateralization represents a form of internal credit enhancement because it can be used to absorb losses. For example, if the liability of the structure is  $300 million and the collateral's value is$ 320 million, then the structure is overcollateralized by $20 million. Thus, the first $20 million of losses will not result in a loss to any of the tranches.

Senior/Subordinated Structure In a senior/subordinated structure there is a senior tranche and at least one junior or subordinated tranche. For example, suppose a deal has 300 million as collateral. The structure may look as follows: senior tranche 270 million

subordinated tranche 30 million

This means that the first 30 million of losses are absorbed by the subordinated tranche.

There is no reason why there must be only one subordinated tranche. The structure can have more than one subordinated tranche. A senior/ subordinated structure may look like that shown in Exhibit 15.2. The first tranche to realize any losses is tranche G in the structure shown in Exhibit 15.2. This tranche is referred to as the first loss tranche. Notice that the tranche is unrated.

The basic concern in the senior/subordinated structure is that while the subordinated tranches provide a certain level of credit protection for the senior tranche at the closing of the deal, the level of protection changes over time due to prepayments. The objective after the deal closes is to distribute any prepayments such that the credit protection for the senior tranche does not deteriorate over time. There is a well developed mechanism used to address this concern called the shifting interest mechanism. We will discuss the shifting interest mechanism when we discuss structural analysis later.

# Rating Agency Determination of Credit Enhancement Levels

The rating agencies determine the appropriate amount of credit enhancement for a given pool of collateral. For example, Standard & Poor's (S&P) developed its rating standards through analysis of the Great Depression of the 1930s and the regional recessions of the 1980s (such as in Houston, Texas). S&P's analysis begins with a "prime pool" of mortgage loans. The criteria for a prime pool are as follows:

300 or more loans geographically diverse

first lien

■ single-family detached purchase mortgage

30-year term fully amortizing

fixed-rate

■ full documentation owner occupied

80\% LTV balances less than 300,000

For a prime pool, S&P has statistics by rating and loan-to-value ratio for (1) foreclosure frequency and (2) loss severity. The product of the foreclosure frequency and loss severity gives the base case loss coverage required for a prime pool. So, for example, if a AA rating is sought for a prime pool and the corresponding foreclosure and loss severity is  $10\%$  and  $40\%$ , respectively, then: base case loss coverage required for a AA prime pool  $= 10\% \times 40\% = 4\%$

Adjustments are made to the prime pool loss coverage for each deviation from the prime loan criteria. For example, there will be an adjustment based on the loan-to-value ratio. For a prime pool, the LTV criterion is  $80\%$ . Suppose that a target rating of AA is sought but that the loans have an LTV of  $90\%$  and the loans have private mortgage insurance. Assuming that the frequency foreclosure and severity loss for a AA rating for a pool which is prime except that the LTV is  $90\%$  instead of  $80\%$  is  $15\%$  and  $29\%$ , respectively, then the loss coverage required would be  $4.4\%$  ( $= 15\% \times 29\%$ ). That is, base case loss coverage increases from  $4\%$  to  $4.4\%$ .

After the adjustments for deviations from the prime loss criteria, S&P then scales the base case coverage required for a AA prime loan for any other rating that might be desired. In general, the adjustment is as follows: base case loss coverage required for a AA prime pool after adjusting for deviations from prime pool  $\times$  factor based on rating sought

The "factor based on rating sought" will be greater than 1 if a rating higher than AA is sought and less than 1 if a rating lower than AA is sought.

Rating approaches to credit enhancement levels vary by agency. Moody's philosophy is that ratings on mortgage securities are comparable to other types of securities (i.e., corporate and municipal bonds). Therefore, from the analysis of bonds that it has rated, Moody's determines expected credit losses in terms of yield impairment within each rating level. Fitch's approach is similar to S&P's, except Fitch places more emphasis on regional economics.

# Structural Analysis

An investor in a nonagency security (as well as a real estate-backed ABS) should understand the deal structure. In addition to understanding the class strarching, this involves understanding the type of senior/subordinated structure, methods of allocating losses, deal triggers, clean-up calls, and compensating interest. We discuss each of these in the sections that follow.

# Shifting Interest Structure

In a shifting interest structure, the subordinated classes are designed not to decrease as a percentage of the total outstanding principal. In this structure, amortization and interest are allocated pro-rata among all the deal's classes. Prepayments that would normally be allocated to the subordinated tranches are shifted to the senior tranches for a period of time. For example, for an initial period of five years,  $100\%$  of all prepayments on the mortgage pool are allocated to the senior tranches. After the initial prepayment lockout period, a smaller percentage of the pro-rata share of the subordinated tranche's prepayment is paid to the senior classes. A typical shifting interest structure is given in Exhibit 15.3.

In a shifting interest structure, the junior class has a claim not on a particular amount of cash flow, but on a portion of the underlying assets. Realized losses act to reduce the lowest subordinated tranche outstanding balance on a dollar for dollar basis. Hence, the first-loss tranche will be reduced by losses until its principal balance is exhausted, then the next highest rated tranche will absorb losses, and so on.

# Methods of Allocating Losses

Losses within a senior/subordinated structure are absorbed by the most junior tranche, although the timing and allocation of cash flow can vary within a deal structure. There are two traditional methods of allocating losses within a senior/subordinated structure: (1) the waterfall method and (2) the direct write-off method. Exhibit 15.4 highlights the differences between these two methods.

Several distinctions should be made between the two methods. First, under the waterfall method, multitranche subordinated structures can be adversely affected with the accrual of interest payments. For example, in the illustration given in Exhibit 15.4, the mezzanine tranche receives only  $28,333 of its scheduled$ 67,667 interest payment. Therefore, a shortfall is created that must be repaid in later periods. If credit problems persist, the unpaid interest can amount to several months without any cash flow. This problem, which arises due to the payment of the senior's share of the loss in cash, can severely impact the liquidity of the tranche in accrual status.[3]

Under the direct write-off method, the senior bond is entitled to the proceeds of the liquidated property, and any loss is written off against the most junior tranche. In addition, all interest and scheduled principal are allocated on a pro-rata basis.

# Deal Triggers

An important component to be considered when analyzing senior/subordinated tranches is the deal's "triggers." Triggers are step-down tests that allow the subordinated tranches to be reduced as a percentage of the overall deal. For example, as illustrated in Exhibit 15.5, the subordinated bonds in the standard senior/subordinated structure are locked out from unscheduled payments (prepayments) for five years. Following this lockout period, the prepayment protection gradually "steps down" until the subordinated tranches receive their full pro-rata share of prepayments in year 10.

During the initial 5-year lockout period, the subordinated bonds delever, that is, they grow as a percentage of the overall deal. This delevering can occur only if a series of tests (or covenants) are met. These tests address (1) total losses and (2) total delinquencies  $(60+$  days).

These tests are levels of credit performance required before the credit support can be reduced. The tests are applied annually after year 5, and monthly if a test is failed. Of the two tests, the loss test prevents a step-down from occurring if cumulative losses exceed a certain limit (which changes over time). The delinquency test, in its most common form, prevents any step-down from taking place as long as the current over 60-day delinquency rate exceeds  $2\%$  of the then-current pool balance.

The above step-down criteria remain in effect on older deals. However, most deals issued after October 1995 are subject to new step-down tests. Following that date new requirements were adopted by the rating agencies, particularly in the area of delinquencies. This was done largely as a result of the fact that many strong deals have performed well and have, in fact, been upgraded by the agencies, despite running delinquencies above  $2\%$  of the current pool balance. Under these new tests, the delinquency measures are less stringent and, as a result, present less extension risk for subordinated tranche holders.

# Clean-Up Calls

Nonagency deals are usually subject to a  $5\%$  to  $10\%$  clean-up call; that is, the issuer has the right to collapse a deal if the deal factor is down to 0.05 to 0.10. As shown in Exhibit 15.6, the average life can vary significantly if run to the call date. This option has two major effects on subordinated tranche holders. First, since most subordinated tranches trade at discounts to par, it has a positive impact since par is received. Second, since these calls come into play before maturity, the duration and average life will shorten.

Although most deals use a  $10\%$  clean-up call, that does not necessarily mean that these deals will be called. Reasons why many deals may not be called include:

1. Advances in computer technology allow servicers to continue to maintain pool servicing functions economically.
2. Adverse selection (last loans in a pool can be the least creditworthy) may prevent the repurchase of these loans.
3. Issuer of pool often retains economic interest in pool by controlling servicing function and/or by owning the IO-tranche.

# Compensating Interest

A feature unique to nonagency MBS is compensating interest. MBS pay principal and interest on a monthly basis. While homeowners may prepay their mortgage on any day throughout the month, the agencies guarantee and pay investors a full month of interest as if all the prepayments occur on the last day of the month. This guarantee does not apply to nonagency MBS. If a homeowner pays off a mortgage on the tenth day of the month, he will not have to pay interest for the rest of the month. Because of the payment delay (for example, 25 days), the investor will receive full principal but only 10 days of interest on the 25th of the following month.

Source: Figure 1 in "Compensating Interest: Rarely an Issue," Paine Webber Mortgage Strategist (September 8, 1998), p. 19.

This phenomenon is known as payment interest shortfall or compensating interest and is handled differently by different issuers. Some issuers will only pay up to a specified amount and some will not pay at all. Actually, it is the servicers who will pay any compensating interest. The servicer obtains the shortfall in interest from the servicing spread. The shortfall that will be made up to the investor may be limited to the entire servicing spread or part of the servicing spread. Thus, while an investor has protection against the loss of a full month's interest, the protection may be limited.

The compensating interest policies of issuers have changed dramatically over the past few years. Whereas at one time some issuers offered no compensating interest, today the compensating interest policies of the major issuers of nonagency securities provide at least 12.5 basis points of compensating interest. There are three aspects regarding the compensating interest policy that the investor should be aware of: (1) the maximum compensating interest, (2) the types of prepayments covered—prepayment in full and curtailments, and (3) the prepayment remittance cycle.

Exhibit 15.7 provides an illustration of the computation of how the maximum compensating interest is computed and how the compensation is determined. The illustration assumes that the issuer will pay compensating interest up to an amount equal to 12.5 basis points per year. Based on the assumptions in the exhibit the maximum compensating interest is 30,880.19. The interest shortfall based on the assumptions is 19,969.68. Since the maximum compensating interest available is greater than the interest shortfall, the interest shortfall will be covered.

# How Do Losses Occur?

Investors in subordinated tranches must understand how losses occur. As shown in the flowchart in Exhibit 15.8, before a pool loss can occur a loan must pass from current status into 30-, 60-, and 90-day delinquency status before finally entering the foreclosure process. During this process, the servicer plays a very important function.

It should be pointed out that the servicer will commonly advance (principal and interest) to bondholders all the way through foreclosure. These advances, which will be reimbursed once the property is liquidated, will be paid before any pool losses are calculated.

The servicer also will work to prevent any losses from occurring to bondholders. The servicer will attempt to minimize losses, once a loan becomes delinquent, by:

1. Contacting the borrower and seeking to bring the balance current.
2. Providing the borrower with a new loan schedule (to bring the balance current).
3. Encouraging owners with equity to sell the property.

If any of these strategies are successful, the servicer has prevented a delinquent loan from resulting in a pool loss.

EXHIBIT 15.8 Flowchart of the Way Losses Occur

The best defense against pool losses adversely impacting the subordinated tranches is homeowner's equity in the property. That is, the homeowner's down payment or actual perceived equity in a particular property is the first line of defense against default. Defaults rationally occur only when a negative equity condition exists. Otherwise the homeowner would sell the property to prevent default.

Empirical studies of homeowners in negative equity situations show that only a small portion of this universe will default. Statistics show that it requires a period of severe borrower stress (i.e., divorce or unemployment) coupled with a negative equity condition to result in significant levels of default. Mortgage borrowers have resisted default in most negative equity situations due to: (1) the social stigma of losing one's home, (2) fear of tarnishing one's credit rating, and (3) the ongoing need for housing. Furthermore, negative equity/default conditions are not that common to begin with because of annual versus fixed-debt burden.

For a typical 30-year loan with a  $75\%$  LTV ratio, the LTV ratio will decline to  $71.4\%$  after five years and  $66.1\%$  after ten years, assuming no housing inflation. This occurs due to normal amortization of principal over the loan's 30-year life. If any improvement in housing values is assumed (i.e.,  $2\%$  housing inflation), the LTV ratio will decline to  $64.7\%$  after five years and  $54.2\%$  after ten years. Thus credit mortgage pools have a normal tendency to improve with time.

In evaluating subordinated tranches, investors attempt to project losses and their timing. A widely used loss curve for this purpose is the Moody's loss curve shown below:

<table><tr><td>Age</td><td>Losses</td><td>Cumulative</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.5\%</td><td>0.5\%</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3.5\%</td><td>4.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>11.0\%</td><td>15.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>21.5\%</td><td>36.5\%</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>13.5\%</td><td>57.5\%</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>13.5\%</td><td>71.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>11.5\%</td><td>82.5\%</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>7.5\%</td><td>90.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>7.0\%</td><td>97.0\%</td></tr><tr><td>10+</td><td>3.0\%</td><td>100.0\%</td></tr></table>

This loss curve highlights the expected timing of losses for 30-year collateral fixed-rate single-family pools. The shape of the curve highlights the fact that losses do not typically occur during the first year

(since the foreclosure process can often last more than one year), but are typically concentrated in years 3 through 7. During these years the homeowner has not had substantial time to amortize principal or enjoy the benefit of housing inflation. This is in direct conflict with the longer part of the loss curve, where losses become quite rare due to seasoning and the build-up of the homeowner's equity.

# NAS and Super-NAS Bonds

In agency CMO deals and nonagency deals, planned amortization class tranches can be included to provide the PAC tranches with prepayment protection, the protection coming from the support tranches in the structure. In the nonagency market, another structure that provides prepayment protection for a some senior tranches is the non-accelerated senior (NAS) tranches.

# Structural Development

There have been three generations of structural development with regard to the NAS market. The phases of development are shown in Exhibit 15.9. The first generation of NAS development was the super-senior bond, which was common in nonagency CMO deals during the early 1990s. The super-senior bond was created in order to ease senior investor fears about the credit risk inherent in nonagency pools which had relatively high California loan concentrations. The thought process was that if the rating agency required  $6\%$  subordination on a deal with a high California concentration, then any potential investor credit concerns should be eased if the subordination level were raised to  $16\%$ . (See Exhibit 15.10.)

Super-senior bonds are created by splitting the senior bonds into two parts: the super-senior and the mezzanine bonds. The mezzanine bonds, despite the fact that they enjoy AAA ratings, were subordinated to the other AAA bonds in terms of loss priority.

The AAA mezzanine bonds do, however, enjoy the same hard lock-out features as the subordinated bonds in the structure. That is, during the first five years,  $100\%$  of unscheduled principal payments (i.e., the prepayments) from the collateral pool go to pay down the senior bonds. (See Exhibit 15.11.) However, unlike traditional subordinated bonds, not all mezzanine bonds are required to pass the loss and delinquency trigger tests in order to begin to receive their pro rata share of unscheduled principal payments.

The super-senior structure was phased out around 1992-1993 as the California housing market improved, but the AAA mezzanine concept reappeared in 1994 as a method to structure AAA rated bonds with call protection superior to those available in the planned amortization class (PAC) market.

EXHIBIT 15.12 Creating Super-NAS Bonds

Source: "Super-NAS Bonds: Required Summer Reading," Paine Webber Mortgage Strategist (June 9, 1998), p. 16.

Despite the popularity of the AAA mezzanine structure, the second phase of development occurred because AAA mezzanine bonds were not Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) eligible. ERISA eligibility was an important factor in bringing pension fund investors into this market. ERISA guidelines state that the subordinated status of AAA mezzanine bonds would make them ineligible investments for pension funds. Therefore, Wall Street came up with the non-accelerated senior (NAS) bond.

The NAS bond had all the benefits of the AAA mezzanine plus ERISA eligibility. This was the case since the NAS bond shared losses  $\text{pari-pasu}$  with all other senior bonds in the structure (i.e., it was not subordinated).

The NAS bond is created in a similar way to the PAC bond in that the bond has a schedule which leads to more average life volatility in the other senior bonds. Because of this schedule (i.e., complete 5-year prepay lockout followed by subordinated-like step down schedule), the NAS bond can only receive principal ahead of schedule if all other senior bonds are completely retired. Thus, all senior bonds act to buffer the NAS bond.

The latest or third state of NAS development is the super-NAS. The super-NAS was created in order to further stabilize the average life profile of the NAS bond. Structurally the super-NAS was created as shown in Exhibit 15.12.

The super-NAS is a bond with less average life variability than an ordinary NAS. The super-NAS bond is created by time tranching the NAS cash flows such that the shorter bond becomes the "super-NAS" and the longer bond cash flows are returned to the senior bonds. The result is a shorter and less volatile super-senior with a tighter principal payment window.

* PPC refers to the prospectus prepayment speed assumption. For example, 100 PPC is the assumed prepayment vector.

# NAS Percent of Deal

Another important NAS feature is the size of the NAS relative to the overall deal size. That is, NAS bonds are referred to as  $10\%$  NAS bonds,  $20\%$  NAS bonds, and so forth. This percentage represents the NAS tranche size as a percentage of the overall deal. For example, assume two NAS bonds are created, one a  $10\%$  NAS and the other a  $20\%$  NAS. (See Exhibit 15.13.) Additionally, assume both structures have  $6\%$  subordination below the NAS bonds. Comparing the structure of the two deals, the larger NAS bond (i.e.,  $20\%$  NAS) has a lower senior bonds/NAS bond ratio which results in fewer bonds to support or buffer the cash flow variability of the NAS. This means that a smaller NAS, with its lower average life variability, is a better NAS bond.

# NAS Bond Profile

Because of its schedule, the NAS bond will have a more stable average life profile than a comparable duration sequential-pay bond from the same deal. Exhibit 15.14 shows the average life profile for two Alternative A deals, one with  $10\%$  NAS and one with  $20\%$  NAS. As shown previously, the lower the percentage NAS within the deal, the more stable the average life profile of all bonds within the deal. Additionally, NAS bonds have significantly lower cash flow variability than comparable duration sequential-pay bonds. This lower variation in cash flow average lives results in lower option costs on the NAS bonds.

# Comparing Super-NAS Bonds with NAS Bonds

As mentioned earlier, super-NAS bonds are a shorter, more stable version of the standard NAS bond. Super NAS bonds also have a tighter principal payment window, since the tail NAS cash flows are placed into the senior bonds. Exhibit 15.15 compares the average life variability and principal windows of a  $20\%$  NAS bond with a similar sized superNAS Alternative A collateralized bond.

The first factor to notice is that the super-NAS has much lower average life dispersion (or range), between 75 PPC and 150 PPC, than does the NAS bond. Additionally, the base case principal window is much narrower (August 2003–September 2012) than the traditional NAS bond (August 2003–June 2028).

At slower prepayment speeds (i.e., 75 PPC), the super-NAS bond extends less than the traditional NAS bond. This is due to the fact that the bond maintains its schedule while the tail cash flow was structured into other senior bonds. This is apparent in the principal window as the final payment date extends only from September 2012 to June 2013 when prepayments slow from 100 PPC to 75 PPC.

Similarly, the super-NAS bond is subject to less contraction risk since it is a shorter average life bond in the base case. It is also apparent from Exhibit 15.14 that the average lives of both bonds at 150 PPC is 7.6 years. Additionally, note that the principal payment window under both bond structures is identical (August 2003-June 2028). The payment window on the super-NAS bond shifts out due to the fact that at these fast prepayment speeds, all of the senior bonds will be paid down prior to the end of the 10-year NAS bond shifting interest schedule. In this scenario, the super-NAS bond becomes the only AAA or senior bond remaining in the deal and must therefore assume the principal window of the underlying collateral.

As shown in Exhibit 15.16, at fast prepayment speeds, the average lives and principal windows of both the NAS and super-NAS are the same. However, at moderately faster speeds, such as at 125 PPC, the super-NAS actually extends due to the NAS tail (which was combined with the other senior bonds) providing added call protection to the super-NAS. At faster speeds, this tail is paid down and the super-NAS and NAS bonds assume the same profile.

# REAL ESTATE-BACKED ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES

In this section we discuss mortgage-related products that are classified in the marketplace as asset-backed securities. The products include bonds backed by home equity loans, 125 loans, and manufactured housing loans.

# Closed-End Home Equity Loan-Backed Securities

A home equity loan (HEL) is a loan backed by residential property. At one time, the loan was typically a second lien on property that was already pledged to secure a first lien. In some cases, the lien was a third lien. However, the character of a home equity loan has changed. Today, a home equity loan is often a first lien on property where the borrower has either an impaired credit history and/or the payment-to-income ratio is too high for the loan to qualify as a conforming loan for securitization by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac. Typically, the borrower used a home equity loan to consolidate consumer debt using the current home as collateral rather than to obtain funds to purchase a new home.

Home equity loans can be either closed-end or open-end. Our focus is on securities backed by closed-end HELs. A closed-end HEL is structured the same way as a fully amortizing residential mortgage loan. That is, it has a fixed maturity and the payments are structured to fully amortize the loan by the maturity date. There are both fixed-rate and variable-rate closed-end HELs. Typically, variable-rate loans have a ref erence rate of 6-month LIBOR and have periodic caps and lifetime caps. The cash flow of a pool of closed-end HELs is comprised of interest, regularly scheduled principal payments, and prepayments, just as with mortgage-backed securities. We will discuss open-end HELs later.

# Payment Structure

As with nonagency mortgage-backed securities discussed earlier, there are passthrough and paythrough home equity loan-backed structures. Typically, home equity loan-backed securities are securitized by both closed-end fixed-rate and adjustable-rate (or variable-rate) HELs. The securities backed by the latter are called HEL floaters and most are backed by non-prime HELs. The reference rate of the underlying loans typically is 6-month LIBOR. The cash flow of these loans is affected by periodic and lifetime caps on the loan rate. To increase the attractiveness of home equity loan-backed securities to investors, the securities typically have been created in which the reference rate is 1-month LIBOR. Because of (1) the mismatch between the reference rate on the underlying loans and that of the HEL floater and (2) the periodic and life caps of the underlying loans, there is a cap on the coupon rate for the HEL floater. Unlike a typical floater, which has a cap that is fixed throughout the security's life, the effective periodic and lifetime cap of a HEL floater is variable. The effective cap, referred to as the available funds cap or net funds cap, will depend on the amount of funds generated by the net coupon on the principal, less any fees.

Let's look at one issue, Advanta Mortgage Loan Trust 1995-2 issued in June 1995. At the offering, this issue had approximately 122 million closed-end HELs. There were 1,192 HELs—727 fixed-rate loans and 465 variable-rate loans. There were five classes (A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, and A-5) and a residual. The five classes are summarized below:

<table><tr><td>Class</td><td>Par amount ($)</td><td>Passthrough coupon rate (\%)</td></tr><tr><td>A-1</td><td>9,229,000</td><td>7.30</td></tr><tr><td>A-2</td><td>30,330,000</td><td>6.60</td></tr><tr><td>A-3</td><td>16,455,000</td><td>6.85</td></tr><tr><td>A-4</td><td>9,081,000</td><td>floating rate</td></tr><tr><td>A-5</td><td>56,917,000</td><td>floating rate</td></tr></table>

The collateral is divided into group I and group II. The 727 fixed-rate loans are included in group I and support Classes A-1, A-2, A-3, and A-4. The 465 variable-rate loans are in group II and support Classes A-5-I and A-5-II certificates. All classes receive monthly principal and interest (based on the passthrough coupon rate).

EXHIBIT 15.17 HEL ABS Structuring

The initial investors in the A-5 floating-rate certificates were given a choice between two sub-classes that offered different floating rates. Subclass A-5-I has a passthrough coupon rate equal to the lesser of (1)  $12\%$  or (2) 1-month LIBOR plus 32 basis points with a cap of  $12\%$ . Subclass A-5-II has a passthrough coupon rate equal to the lesser of (1) the interest rate for sub-class A-5-I or (2) the group II available funds cap. The available funds cap is the maximum rate payable on the outstanding Class A-5 certificates principal balance based on the interest due on the variable-rate loans net of fees and minus 50 basis points.

The Class A-4 certificate also has a floating rate. The rate is  $7.4\%$  subject to the net funds cap for group I. This is the rate that is paid until the outstanding aggregate loan balances in the trust have declined to  $10\%$  or less. At that time, Class A-4 will accrue interest on a payment date that depends on the average net loan rate minus 50 basis points and the net funds cap rate for group I.

# Credit Enhancement

All forms of credit enhancement described for nonagency MBS have been used for home equity loan-backed securities. HEL issuers typically have two alternatives when it comes to structuring an ABS transaction. The issuer can pay a premium to an insurer and have the bonds "wrapped" with a AAA guarantee, or try to sell a senior/subordinated deal where the major form of credit protection is internal credit enhancement. Exhibit 15.17 shows a diagram of these alternatives. The senior/subordinate structure was discussed earlier in this chapter. Here we will look at the wrapped deals.

If the issuer tries to have his deal wrapped, the insurer will charge the issuer a premium (which is based on the credit quality of the underlying collateral) in order to obtain the insurer's guarantee of the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal on all wrapped bonds.

Wrap insurers look at their business like catastrophe insurance; that is, they only expect a minute probability of having to pay a claim. This is the expectation for three reasons. First, HEL ABS transactions are structured so that the internal credit enhancement (i.e., the residual B-pieces, overcollateralization, and reserve accounts) would achieve an investment grade rating on a stand-alone basis. This is called a "shadow rating." Second, the deal's servicer will perform the insurer's role of advancing interest and principal due but not collected. Additionally, the servicer will pay compensating interest on prepayment interest rate shortfalls. Finally, if the deal does start to underperform, "triggers" will protect the insurer by allowing excess spread to be diverted back into the deal.

There are three additional advantages of investing in wrap deals versus senior/subordinated structures—liquidity, credit protection, and expertise. Wrap deals have the benefit of added liquidity since investors look first to the credit of the insurer rather than to the characteristics of the pool. This factor leads to much more liquidity and ability to trade in the underlying bonds. As mentioned previously, the insurer will guarantee the timely payment of interest and the ultimate full payment of principal. Additionally, the obligation is unconditional and irrevocable. This guaranty also covers instances of fraud on the part of the issuer, originator, and/or servicer. These added protections should be of great comfort to the investor and mitigate headline or pool risk. Additionally, since the pool has an investment grade shadow rating, if the AAA insurer is ever downgraded, internal credit enhancement should be adequate to maintain an investment grade rating. Finally, wrap providers bring an added layer of expertise to a transaction. That is, they perform pre-closing due diligence and review individual loan files. Additionally, the insurer monitors collateral performance and oversees the activities of the servicer. This added protection should give the investor comfort in wrapped HEL transactions.

# Open-End Home Equity Loan-Backed Securities

With an open-end HEL the homeowner is given a credit line and can write checks or use a credit card for up to the amount of the credit line. The amount of the credit line depends on the amount of equity the borrower has in the property. There is a revolving period over which the homeowner can borrow funds against the line of credit. At the end of the term of the loan, the homeowner either pays off the amount borrowed in one payment or the outstanding balance is amortized. It has been estimated that in the 1990s, HELOCs have been  $20\%$  to  $25\%$  of all home equity originations. However, only  $7\%$  of HELOCs have been securitized.

The revolving period for a HELOC is the period where the borrower can take down all or part of the line of credit. The revolving period can run from 10 to 15 years. At the end of the revolving period, the HELOC can specify either a balloon payment or an amortization schedule (of up to 10 years). Almost all HELOCs are floating-rate loans. The interest rate paid by about  $75\%$  of HELOC borrowers is reset monthly to the prime rate (as reported in the Wall Street Journal) plus a spread.

The bonds created in HELOC deals are floating-rate tranches. While the underlying loans are priced based on a spread over the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal, the securities created are based on a spread over 1-month LIBOR.

Because HELOCs are for revolving lines, the deal structures are quite different for HELOCs and closed-end HELs. As with other ABS involving revolving credit lines such as credit card deals, there is a revolving period, an amortization period, and a rapid amortization period.

# Securities Backed by 125 Loans

One of the newer segments of the mortgage market is low/no equity second mortgages. These loans have high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios which generally range between  $95\%$  to  $125\%$  (hence the name "125 LTV loans"). The origination process involved in these loans focuses on credit rather than property value. That is, 125 LTV lenders target prime borrowers or borrowers who have strong credit histories (i.e., prime or A-borrowers). The well-publicized increase in consumer debt, as well as the attractive economics of the debt consolidation loan, are the basis of the rapid growth of the 125 LTV market. The economics of the debt consolidation loan are very attractive to the high quality borrower.

The "three Cs" of traditional underwriting—credit reputation, capacity, and collateral—are modified in formulating 125 LTV loan guidelines. The primary difference in focus on 125 LTV loans is that the third "C" (collateral) is often missing in the underwriting process. Despite this fact, 125 LTV lenders do file a lien against the borrower's home. The process of securing the loan with a lien creates for most borrowers a sense of obligation. Thus, in the underwriting process, borrower credit is of utmost importance and rates are assigned assuming little or no value can be obtained by foreclosing on the property. 125 LTV lenders seek to attract a borrower with a good credit history with FICO scores in the high 680s.

The most common structure for 125 LTV loan transactions is the senior/subordinated structure. The basic structure of the deal includes a series of AAA-rated sequential-pay bonds. These bonds achieve their AAA rating by virtue of the subordinated tranches M-1 through B-2 (rated AA to BB). In a typical 125 LTV transaction, credit support comes from the following three sources: (1) excess spread, (2) overcollateralization, and (3) subordination.

Typically, prepayment assumptions are considerably slower than other types of mortgage structures, such as home equity loans, nonagency jumbo loans, and agency MBS. The reasons for these slow prepayment assumptions are threefold. First, the typical 125 LTV borrower has a negative equity situation in his or her primary asset (the house). Therefore, the borrower would be ineligible to refinance for most home loan programs. Second, the 125 LTV borrower has recently paid substantial upfront costs (i.e., 5 to 8 points) in order to get into the loan. Therefore, the economics of a rate refinancing would have to be significant given the average balance of the loan (average loan size of 30,000) to justify the refinancing. Third, most new 125 LTV loans contain prepayment penalties which make rate refinancing most uneconomical.

Additionally, prepayments on 125 LTV deals impact the structure differently than on nonagency mortgage deals. That is, like on nonagency deals, subordinated tranches are locked out from prepayments. However unlike nonagency deals, fast prepayments—particularly when they occur early in the deal's life (i.e., while the reserve fund is being built)—can weaken the overall credit structure of the deal. That is, excess spread (which is the primary credit protection on 125 LTV deals) is really like an IO. Therefore, prepayments lessen the scope of the excess spread protection by shrinking the amount of cash available to protect against losses. On the other hand, deleveraging occurs at the subordinated tranche level when prepayments occur. This is the case since the senior bonds must absorb all prepayments for a minimum of 36 months, which causes the subordinated bonds to grow as a percentage of the overall deal.

# Manufactured Housing-Backed Securities

Manufactured housing means single-family detached homes constructed off-site and transported to a plot of land or to a manufactured housing community (park). There are two types of manufactured housing (MH) units: (1) single-section (also known as "single-wides") and (2) multisections. Single-wide units, which are transported to their site in one piece, average 1,065 square feet. Multisection units are assembled at the site after being transported in pieces, and average 1,525 square feet.

The typical manufactured housing loan is a 15to 20-year fully amortizing retail installment loan. Therefore, as with residential mortgage loans and HELs, the cash flow of a pool of MH loans consists of net interest, regularly scheduled principal, and prepayments. Single-section units are usually financed over 15-year terms at rates between 300 to 350 basis points above conventional 30-year rates. Multisection units are usually financed over 20-year terms at rates between 250 to 300 basis points over conventional 30-year rates.

Manufactured housing has proven to be a market which is largely interest rate insensitive. We believe that this is the case for the following reasons. First, MH loans have small balances resulting in minimal saving from refinancings. Even a decline of 200 basis points for a typical  $35,000 \, \text{MH}$  loan would result in only a  $\$44$  monthly savings. Second, manufactured housing units, like cars, are subject to depreciation. In the early years of a loan's life, depreciation exceeds amortization leaving the borrower with little equity which is needed to refinance. Third, few refinancing options are currently available for used manufactured housing units. Finally, MH borrowers may not qualify for alternative financings because of their limited financial resources.

# OTHER PRODUCTS BACKED BY REAL ESTATE MORTGAGES

We conclude this chapter with two financial products backed by real estate mortgages—both residential and commercial. The two products are real estate investment trusts and collateralized debt obligations.

# Real Estate Investment Trusts

The major activity of a real estate investment trust (REIT) is generating income from buying, operating, and selling residential and commercial real estate. As with mutual funds, REITs are passthrough entities under the Internal Revenue Code and therefore free from taxation at the corporate level if certain provisions are satisfied. Specifically, to maintain a tax-free status, a REIT must (1) pay dividends equaling at least  $90\%$  of its taxable income and (2) more than  $75\%$  of total investment assets must be in real estate assets.

REITs are classified into the following three categories: mortgage REITs, equity REITs, and hybrid REITs. Mortgage REITs lend funds to owners of real estate (residential and commercial), as well as purchasing mortgages in the secondary market and mortgage-backed securities. The primary source of revenue is interest on the loans and MBS. The key to understanding mortgage REITs is understanding the types of mortgage obligations in which they invest and restrictions (covenants) on management activities.

The primary source of revenue for an equity REIT is rents derived from the ownership and management of real estate property. Of the three categories of REITs, equity REITs are the dominant form, representing more than  $90\%$  of all REITs. Hybrid REITs pursue investment strategies of equity REITs and mortgage REITs. That is, they invest in both properties and mortgages.

# Collateralized Debt Obligations

A collateralized debt obligation is an asset-backed security with collateral that is a diversified pool of one or more bonds. The first CDOs issued were backed by high-yield corporate bonds. Today, there are CDOs backed by residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, particularly subordinated tranches. These CDOs are referred to as ABS/MBS CDOs. A CDO issues securities to raise funds to purchase the collateral. The debt tranches are rated by the rating agencies. CDOs are discussed in more detail in Chapter 20.
