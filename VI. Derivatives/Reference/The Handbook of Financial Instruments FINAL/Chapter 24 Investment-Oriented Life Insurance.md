# Investment-Oriented Life Insurance

Frank J. Jones, Ph.D.

Chief Investment Officer

The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America

Insurance and investments are distinct concepts. This distinction leads to the development of various insurance and investment products. In practice, however, there is an overlap between some types of insurance products and investment products. This overlap occurs due partially to specific tax advantages provided to investment-oriented life insurance products. The two major types of investment-oriented life insurance are cash value life insurance and annuities.

This chapter begins with an overview of insurance. The remainder of the chapter considers the major types of investment-oriented life insurance, mainly cash value life insurance and annuities.

# INSURANCE

Insurance is defined as a contract whereby one party—the insured—substitutes a small certain cost (the insurance premium) for a large uncertain financial loss based on a future contingent event. Thus, there are two parties to an insurance contract, the insured, who pays the premium and receives protection; and the insurer (or insurance company), which collects the premium and provides the protection.

Most types of insurance provide for a prespecified payment from the insurer to the insured if and when the contingent insured event occurs and otherwise have no value. This is called pure insurance. Other types of insurance have a "cash value" even if the contingent event does not occur. This is called investment-oriented insurance. The two types of investment-oriented insurance are discussed later.

The major types of insurance, in general, are:2

Life

Health

Disability

Property (home and automobile)

Liability

Of these types, only life insurance has a cash value form in addition to pure insurance. Cash value life insurance is a very important type of investment-oriented life insurance. Therefore, let's consider life insurance in more detail.

According to a pure life insurance contract, the insurer (the life insurance company) pays the beneficiary of the contract a fixed amount if the insured dies while the life insurance contract is valid. If the insured does not die while the policy is valid, the insurance contract becomes worthless at its expiration. To provide pure life insurance contracts, the insurance company—specifically its actuaries—calculate the probability of the insured dying during the period the contract is valid. Many variables affect this probability, including physical health and whether the person smokes. The most important variable, however, is the insured's age. Specifically, the probability of death increases with age. Actuaries estimate this relationship with some degree of precision.

Obviously the insurance premium charged by the insurance company must cover the average amount paid to all insureds, the administrative and distribution costs, and a profit. The cost of pure insurance to the company depends on the probability of the insured dying during the period which increases with age, as shown in Exhibit 24.1.

Overall, the premium charged to the insured for a pure life insurance contract is shown in Exhibit 24.2, which is determined by the probability of death (the "cost" of paying the death benefit) plus the distribution and administrative costs plus the profits. Pure life insurance is called term insurance. It is applicable over the term of the policy.

EXHIBIT 24.2 Annual Premium for Yearly Renewable Term Policy

There are three types of term insurance. The most common type is called annual renewable term. According to this type, the insured has the right to renew the coverage every year without new underwriting (that is, without a new medical examination). Premiums, however, change; that is, they increase each year and become very expensive at older ages, as indicated below. A second type of term insurance, much less common, does not have the guaranteed renewability feature of the above.

The third type of term insurance is level-premium term, wherein the premium is constant during the life of the policy. Its level is higher than for annual renewable term early in the policy. However, the premium does not increase with age and is lower than an annual renewable term policy late in the life of the policy. Typically, policies of ten years or more are written on a level-premium term.

As indicated, for annual renewable term the annual premium increases significantly with age. For example, for a  $1 million term policy for a 30-year old non-smoking man, the premium will be approximately$ 500 for a 20-year level premium policy (which ends when he is 50). At ages 50, 60, and 70, the same man would pay approximately $2,500, $6,000, and $20,000, respectively, for the same type of 20-year of policy. The premiums for these policies vary significantly by issuing company.

Traditional whole life policy premiums are much higher than for term insurance, often ten times higher or more. For example, a nonsmoking 40-year old man may pay approximately $16,000 per year for a traditional whole life policy. In this case also, the premiums vary considerably by company.

The costs of non-life types of pure insurance are determined in a similar manner. However, in other types of insurance, factors other than the age of the insured may be the dominant variables. For example, location may be important in home insurance: It costs more to insure against hurricanes in Miami and Galveston than in Chicago and San Francisco. And it costs more for a young male (age is a also a factor here) than a middle-aged female to buy automobile insurance. For both, however, prior driving record is important.

# Conceptual Issues in Risk Management

Consider some conceptual issues regarding risk management from the perspective of the insured and the willingness to provide risk coverage from the perspective of the insurer.

From the perspective of the insured, insurance is a mechanism for managing risk. Individuals experience many types of risk and the manner in which they manage the risk depends on the characteristics of the risk. Two important characteristics of the risk are the severity of the risk (the cost) and the frequency of the risk.

There are, in general, also four different ways to manage the risk. Consider specifically these four ways in the context of managing the risk of fire for a house.

Avoidance: Avoid the risk-producing activity. For example, do not build a house in a hot, dry area.

Reduction: Reduce the risk of an activity. For example, build a house in a hot dry area, but add a sprinkler system.

- Retain: Continue the risk producing activity, but do not insure the risk, that is, self-insure. For example, build a house in a hot, dry area, do not buy insurance, and be prepared to pay for the house yourself if the house burns.
■ Insure: Engage in an insurance contract on the risk and pay the premium thereon. For example, buy fire insurance on your house. Fire insurance on a house in a hot, dry area will, however, be expensive.

The way in which an individual manages risk will depend on the characteristics of the risk, as summarized in Exhibit 24.3. That is, insurance is most appropriate when the frequency of the insured event is low and the severity is high. Examples of this type of risk might be a serious automobile accident, your house burning down, or the death of a young person. From the perspective of the insurer, the diversification of the risk is important. The essence of insurance is that the financial burden of the losses suffered by a few is shared among many. Suppose it is estimated that in one year, 100 out of 100,000 homeowners will experience losses caused by fire. This is determined based on data assembled about what happened in the past. Instead of those 100 homeowners bearing the entire financial burden of the losses, the burden is shared among the 100,000 homeowners through premiums for homeowners insurance, which includes protection against fire losses. It is necessary to be able to estimate in advance with reasonable accuracy the aggregate losses that will be suffered by the 100,000 homeowners.

 When the severity of loss is high, retention is not realistic--another technique is needed.

2 When the frequency of loss is high and the severity is high, insurance is very expensive.

3 When the severity of the loss is low, insurance is not needed.

The statistical concept of the "law of large members" is relevant. Considering again life insurance, assume that the probability of death during a 12-month period is  $20\%$  for a given age. If only one person of this age is insured, either  $0\%$  or  $100\%$  of the insureds die, and the insurer experiences either a large loss or a large gain. But if the insurer insures 100 people of this age at an actuarially determined premium, the insurer is likely to have a profit close to the average profit actuarially expected. The law of large numbers says there is more statistical certainty when a large number of insureds (which are diversified) are involved.

The correlation or independence of the individual events is also important. For example, providing hurricane insurance to 100 houses in Galveston, Texas does not benefit from the law of large numbers—either all or none of the houses are likely to experience a hurricane.

In the calculation of premiums, insurers estimate the future based on the past. Insurers need to feel comfortable that their estimates will apply to the future. To calculate the loss component of insurance premiums, insurers multiply their estimates of the probability of future losses times the dollar value of the loss.

# Investment-Oriented Life Insurance Products

This chapter does not consider any of the pure insurance products. Rather, it considers only various types of investment-oriented life insurance products. Such products are shown in Exhibit 24.4. Each product is discussed in more detail in this chapter.

There is an important distinction in investment-oriented life insurance with respect to whether the insured or the insurance company bears the investment risk, that is, who gains or loses if the investment experience is greater or less than expected. Exhibit 24.5 segregates the products by who bears the investment risk.

EXHIBIT 24.6 Annual Premium for Pure Life Insurance Policy

The products in the first column are called "general account products" and those in the second column are called "separate account products." The nature of this distinction is discussed later in this chapter.

In all types of pure insurance, the insurer, that is the insurance company, bears the risk of honoring the contract. That is, it is the obligation of the insurer to deliver the exact amount specified in the insurance contracts. But either the insurance company or the insured may bear the risk of underperforming.

# Cash Value Life Insurance

Consider how cash value life insurance relates to the discussion based on Exhibit 24.2 for pure life insurance. The premium for an annual pure life insurance (term insurance) contract is paid each year for a contract that expires after one year and is shown in Exhibit 24.2 which is reproduced in Exhibit 24.6. The annual term insurance premium is denoted by  $T_{1}T_{2}$ .

This premium,  $T_{1}T_{2}$ , has two important characteristics:

1. The premium increases each year for a new one-year contract, and increasingly so as age increases; and
2. If the insured does not die during the year, the insurance contract expires worthless at the end of the year (and can be replaced by paying a higher premium the next year).

This consideration provides a transition to cash value life insurance. Suppose the insurance company provided pure life insurance for a period much longer than a year, for example the insured's entire life, but charged a constant, called level, premium. In fact, level premium term life insurance is available. In this case, the level premium represents the average premium over the term of the policy. Let  $L_{1}L_{2}$  be the level premium of the term life insurance. Such a policy has no cash value.

Second, suppose that the initial (and constant) premium paid is higher than the cost of pure life insurance. This excess premium can be invested and build up cash value during the term of the policy. For example, in Exhibit 24.6  $T_{1} / T_{2}$  represents the initial cost of annual term insurance,  $L_{1} / L_{2}$  the cost of level premium term insurance, and  $C_{1} / C_{2}$  the level premium of cash value insurance. The excess amount of premium for cash value insurance over annual term,  $C_{1} - T_{1}$  at a young age, in addition to potentially covering the deficit between the cost of pure insurance and cash value insurance at an older age (e.g.,  $T_{2} - C_{2}$ ), can be entered into an investment account of the insured. This is the essence of cash value life insurance.

Each year's premium is segregated into two components by the insurance company. The first is the amount needed to pay for the pure insurance, which, as indicated, increases each year. The second goes into the insured's investment account, which is the cash value of the life insurance contract. An investment return is earned on this cash value, which further increases the cash value. The buildup of this cash value and the ability to borrow against it both have tax advantages, as discussed below. Two important observations can be made here.

First, a common marketing or sales advantage attributed to cash value life insurance is that the higher premium paid will "force" the individuals to save, whereas if they did not pay the higher insurance premium, they would use their income for consumption rather than savings. According to this rationale, the higher insurance premium is, thus, forced savings.

Whether or not this first observation has merit, the second observation unequivocally does. The federal government encourages the use of cash value life insurance by providing significant tax advantages. Thus, the second advantage of cash value life insurance is tax-advantaged savings.

There are several tax advantages to cash value life insurance. The first and major tax advantage is called "inside buildup." This means that the returns on the investment component of the premium, both income and capital gains, are not subject to taxation (income or capital gains) while held in the insurance contract. Inside buildup is a significant advantage to "saving" via a cash value life insurance policy rather than, for example, saving via a mutual fund.

The second tax advantage of a cash value life insurance policy relates to borrowing against the policy. In general, an amount equal to the cash value of the policy can be borrowed. However, there are some tax implications. The taxation of life insurance is covered in more detail in a following section.

Term insurance has become much more of a commodity product and, in fact, there are websites that provide premium quotes for term life insurance for various providers. Cash value life insurance, due to its complexity and multiple features, is not, however, a commodity.

Obviously, the cost of annual term life insurance is much lower than that of whole life insurance, particularly for the young and middle-aged. For example, while there is a wide range of premiums for both term and whole life insurance, for a 35 year old male, the annual cost of  $500,000 of annual term insurance may be$ 400 and the cost of whole life insurance may be $5,000.

# The Nature of Insurance Companies

The nature of an insurance company is quite different than that of a traditional manufacturing company. Consider, for a simple comparison, a bread manufacturing company.

The pricing of bread and the calculation of the profits of a bread manufacturing company are quite simple. The bread manufacturer buys flour and other ingredients, produces the bread with its ovens and bakers, and sells the bread soon thereafter. The costs of the inputs are straightforward (the ovens, of course, must be depreciated) and the revenues are received soon after the costs are incurred. Bread prices may be altered as the costs of the inputs vary. Profits can be measured over short periods of time.

The insurance business is much more complex. Premiums—revenues—are determined initially and may be collected once or over a long period of time. The events that trigger an insurance payout are not only deferred but are also contingent on the occurrence of a specified event, for example death or an automobile accident. Since there is a long and uncertain period between the collection of the premium and the payment of the benefit, the receipts may be invested in the interim and the investment returns represent an important but initially uncertain source of revenue. Insurance company investment practices are not considered in this chapter.

Another important distinction between bread manufacturers and insurance companies is the timing of the claim of the customer on the producing company. The purchaser of a loaf of bread is not concerned about the solvency of the bread manufacturer. The purchaser leaves the store with the bread, that is, the business is "cash and carry."

The purchaser of a life insurance contract, however, has a deferred claim on the life insurance company. This claim may arise decades from the purchase of the life insurance contract. For this reason, the customer is concerned about the long-term solvency of the life insurance company. Rating agencies provide credit ratings on life insurance companies to assist customers in this evaluation. The "claims paying ability," as assessed by these rating agencies, may be an important characteristic to customers in their overall choice of a life insurance company.

In addition, to assure that the insurance company will be able to pay the insurance benefit, if necessary, regulators require that the insurance company retain reserves (in an accounting sense) for the security of future payments. Other accounting complexities are also relevant. Thus, overall, the pricing and measurement of the profits of an insurance company are much more complex than that of a bread manufacturer. And to insure that insurance companies are solvent and pay deferred insurance claims, insurance companies are more regulated than bread manufacturers.

Thus, the fundamental difference between bread manufacturers and life insurance companies is that for bread manufacturers the timing of the costs and revenues is approximately synchronous, while for life insurance companies the timing is potentially very different. There are also significant differences in this regard between annual term insurance and whole life insurance. Companies providing annual term life insurance collect the revenue at the beginning of the year and pay the death benefit by the end of the year, if at all. Companies providing whole life insurance, however, may collect premiums for several years and make a large payment after decades.

# Stock and Mutual Insurance Companies

There are two major forms of life insurance companies, stock and mutual. A stock insurance company is similar in structure to any corporation (also called a public company). Shares (of ownership) are owned by independent shareholders and may be traded publicly. The shareholders care only about the performance of their shares, that is the stock appreciation and the dividends over time. Their holding period and, thus, their view may be short term or long term. The insurance policies are simply the products or businesses of the company in which they own shares.

In contrast, mutual insurance companies have no stock and no external owners. Their policyholders are their owners. The owners, that is the policyholders, care primarily or even solely about the performance of their insurance policies, notably the company's ability to eventually pay on the policy and to, in the interim, provide investment returns on the cash value of the policy, if any. Since these payments may occur considerably into the future, the policyholders' view will be long term. Thus, while stock insurance companies have two constituencies, their stockholders and their policyholders, mutual insurance companies only have one, since their policyholders and their owners are the same. Traditionally, the largest insurance companies have been mutual, but recently there have been many demutualizations, that is, conversions by mutual companies to stock companies. Currently several of the largest life insurance companies are stock companies.

The debate on which is the better form of insurance company, stock or mutual, is too involved to be considered in any depth here. However, consider selected comments on this issue. First, consider this issue from the perspective of the policyholder. Mutual holding companies have only one constituency, their policyholder or owner. The liabilities of many types of insurance companies are long term, particularly the writers of whole life insurance. Thus, mutual insurance companies can appropriately have a long time horizon for their strategies and policies. They do not have to make short-term decisions to benefit their shareholders, whose interests are usually short term, via an increase in the stock price or dividend, in a way that might reduce their long-term profitability or the financial strength of the insurance company. In addition, if the insurance company earns a profit, it can pass the profit onto its policyholders via reduced premiums. (Policies that benefit from an increased profitability of the insurance company are called participating policies, as discussed in the next section.) These increased profits do not have to accrue to stockholders because there are none.

Finally, mutual insurance companies can adopt a longer time frame in their investments, which will most likely make possible a higher return. Mutual insurance companies, for example, typically hold more common stock in their portfolios than stock companies. However, whereas the long time frame of mutual insurance companies may be construed an advantage over stock companies, it may also be construed as a disadvantage. Rating agencies and others assert that, due to their longer horizon and their long time frame, mutual insurance companies may be less efficient and have higher expenses than stock companies. Empirically, rating agencies and others assert that mutual insurance companies have typically significantly reduced their expenses shortly before and after converting to stock companies.

Overall, it is argued, mutual insurance companies have such long planning horizons that they may not operate efficiently, particularly with respect to expenses. Stock companies, on the other hand, have very short planning horizons and may operate to the long-term disadvantage of their policyholders to satisfy their stockholders in the short run. Recently, however, mutual insurance companies have become more cost conscientious.

Consider now the issue of stock versus mutual companies from the perspective of the insurance company. What have been the motivations of mutual insurance companies to go public (issue stock via an initial public offering [IPO]) in recent years? Several reasons are typically given. First, with the financial industry diversifying, consolidating, and growing, many insurance companies have concluded that they need to acquire other financial companies (including other insurance companies, investment companies, broker/dealers, and banks) to prosper or even survive. To conduct these acquisitions they need capital. Mutual companies cannot, by definition, issue stock and are limited in the amount of public debt they can issue—mutual insurance companies issue public debt via "surplus notes." In addition, internal surplus has been growing slowly for the insurance industry. Thus, many insurance companies have concluded that to expand as quickly as they deem essential, they have to be able to raise equity capital and, thus, go public. Second, some mutual insurance companies and their advisors believe that, at least sometimes, stock is a better "acquisition currency" than cash (typically for reasons of taxes and financial accounting), even if the mutual insurance company has enough cash for the acquisition. Finally, company stock and stock options have become a more important form of incentive compensation in many industries, and many insurance companies have concluded that to attract, retain, and motivate the desired executives, they need to be able to provide public stock in their companies.

Whereas many mutual insurance companies go public for these reasons, other mutual insurance companies continue to prosper as mutuals. And while stock insurance companies can raise capital to acquire other companies, they also become vulnerable to being acquired by other companies. Mutual companies cannot be involuntarily acquired.

# General Account versus Separate Account Products

The general account of an insurance company refers to the overall resources of the life insurance company, mainly its investment portfolio. Products "written by the company itself" are said to have a "general account guarantee," that is, they are a liability of the insurance company. When the rating agencies (Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch) provide a credit rating, these ratings are on products written by or guaranteed by the general account, specifically on the "claims-paying ability" of the company. Typical products written by and guaranteed by the general account are whole life, universal life, and fixed annuities (including GICs). Insurance companies must support the guaranteed performance of their general account products to the extent of their solvency. These are called general account products.

Other types of insurance products receive no guarantee from the insurance company's general account, and their performance is based, not on the performance of the insurance company's general account, but solely on the performance of an investment account separate from the general account of the insurance company, often an account selected by the policyholder. These products are called separate account products. Variable life insurance and variable annuities are separate account products. The policyholder selects specific investment portfolios to support these separate account products. The performance of the insurance product depends almost solely on the performance of the portfolio selected, adjusted for the fees or expenses of the insuring company (which do depend on the insurance company). The performance of the separate account products, thus, is not affected by the performance of the overall insurance company's general account portfolio.

Most general account insurance products, including whole life insurance, participate in the performance of the company's general account performance. For example, whereas a life insurance company provides the guarantee of a minimum dividend on its whole life policies, the policies' actual dividend may be greater if the investment portfolio performs well. This is called the "interest component" of the dividend. (The other two components of the dividend are the expense and mortality components.) Thus, the performance of the insurance policy participates in the overall company's performance. Such a policy is called a participating policy, in this case a participating whole life insurance policy.

In addition, the performance of some general account products may not be affected by the performance of the general account portfolio. For example, disability income insurance policies may be written on a general account, and while their payoff depends on the solvency of the general account, the policy performance (for example, its premium) may not participate in the investment performance of the insurance companies' general account investment portfolio.

Both stock and mutual insurance companies write both general and separate account products. However, most participating general account products tend to be written in mutual companies.

# Overview of Cash Value Whole Life Insurance

The details of cash value whole life insurance (CVWLI) are very complex. This section provides a simple overview of CVWLI, partially by contrasting it with term life insurance.

As discussed above, in annual term life insurance, the owner of the policy, typically also the insured, pays an annual premium which reflects the actuarial risk of death during the year. The premium, thus, increases each year. If the insured dies during the year, the death benefit is paid to the insurer's beneficiary. If the insured does not die during the year, the term policy has no value at the end of the year.

The construction and performance of CVWLI is quite different. First, the owner of the policy pays a constant premium over their life. This premium is much higher than a term policy for two reasons. First the constant premium must cover the lower insurance risk early in the policy but also the higher insurance risk later in the policy when the insured has a higher age and the annual cost of the pure insurance exceeds the level premium. Second, the premium is also higher than the average of the pure insurance over the life of the policy and this excess builds up a cash value, which represents the investment value of the policy.

Each year the excess of the premium over the pure insurance cost is invested by the insurance company in its general account portfolio. This portfolio generates a return which accrues to the policy owner's cash value. Typically, the insurance company guarantees a minimum increase in cash value, called the guaranteed cash value buildup. The insurance company, however, may provide an amount in excess of the guaranteed cash value buildup based on earnings for participating policies. What happens to this excess? Assume that the insurance company has a mutual structure, that is, it is owned by the policyholders. In this case, with no stockholders, the earnings accrue to the policyholders as dividends.

The arithmetic of the development of the cash value in a life insurance contract follows:

+ Premium
Cost of Insurance (Mortality)
- Expenses
+Guaranteed (Minimum) Cash Value Buildup
+ (Participating) Dividend

Increase (Buildup) in Cash Value

If the insurance company is owned by stockholders, some or all of the earnings might go to the stockholders as dividends.

The returns to the insurance company and, therefore, the dividends to the policyholder can increase if: (1) investment returns increase; (2) company expenses decrease; or (3) mortality costs decrease (that is, the life expectancy of the insured increases).

The dividends can be "used" by the policyholder in either of two ways. The first is to decrease the annual premium. In this case, the death benefit remains constant. The second is to increase the death benefit and the cash value of the policy. Such increases are called "paid up additions" (PUAs). In this case, the annual premium remains constant. Most policies are written in the second way.

The intended way for the life insurance policy to terminate is for the insured to die and the life insurance company to pay the death benefit to the beneficiary. There are other ways, however. First, the policy can be lapsed (alternatively called forfeited or surrendered). In this case, the owner of the policy withdraws the cash value of the policy and the policy is terminated.

There are also two non-forfeiture options—that is methods whereby an insurance policy for the insured remains. The owner can use the cash value of the policy to buy extended term insurance (the amount and term of the resulting term insurance policy depends on the cash value). In addition, the cash value of the policy can be used to buy a reduced amount of fully paid (that is, no subsequent premiums are due) whole life insurance—this is called reduced paid up.

In addition to the forfeiture option and the two non-forfeiture options of terminating the CVWLI policy, the policy could be left intact and borrowed against. This is called a policy loan. An amount equal to the cash value of the policy can be borrowed. There are two effects of the loan on the policy. First, the dividend is paid only on the amount equal to the cash value of the policy minus the loan. Second, the death benefit of the policy paid is the policy death benefit minus the loan.

The taxation of the death benefit payout, a policy lapse, and borrowing against the loan are considered next. For taxation of life insurance, it is important to recall that the insurance premium is paid by the policy owner with after-tax dollars (this is often called the cost of the policy). But the cash value is allowed to build up inside the policy with taxes deferred (or usually tax-free), often called the return on the policy.

# Taxability of Life Insurance

A major attraction of life insurance as an investment product is its taxability. Consider the four major tax advantages of life insurance.

The first tax advantage is that when the death benefit is paid to the beneficiary of the insurance policy, the benefit is free of income tax. If the life insurance policy is properly structured in an estate plan, the benefit is also free of estate taxes.

The second tax advantage is called "inside buildup"—that is, all earnings (interest, dividend, and realized capital gains) are exempt from income and capital gains taxes. Thus, these earnings are tax deferred (and when included in the death benefit become income tax free, and in some cases also estate tax free).

The third relates to the lapse of a policy. When the policy is lapsed, the owner receives the cash value of the policy. The amount taxed is the cash value minus the cost of the policy (the total premiums paid plus the dividends, if paid in cash). That is, the tax basis of the policy is the cost (accumulated premiums) of the policy. The cost, thus, increases the basis and is recovered tax-free. (Remember, however, that these costs were paid with after-tax dollars.) And, the remainder was allowed to accumulate without taxation but is taxed at the time of the lapse.

The fourth tax issue relates to borrowing against the policy—that is, a policy loan. The primary tax issue is the distinction between the cost (accumulated premium) and the excess of the policy cash value over the cost (call it the excess). When a policy loan is made, the cost is deemed to be borrowed first (that is, FIFO [first in-first out] accounting is employed). The amount up to the cash value of the policy can be borrowed and not be subject to the ordinary income tax. (An exception to this practice—for a Modified Endowment Contract—is discussed in the footnote.)

Although CVWLI has both insurance and investment characteristics, Congress provided insurance policies tax advantages because of their insurance, not their investment, characteristics. And Congress does not wish to apply these insurance-directed tax benefits to primarily investment products. In this regard, in the past some activities related to borrowing against insurance policies were considered abuses by Congress and tax law changes were made to moderate these activities. These abuses originated with a product called single-premium life insurance. This policy is one in which only a single premium is paid for a whole life insurance policy. The premium creates an immediate cash value. This cash value and the resulting investment income earned are sufficient to pay the policy's benefits. The excess investment income accumulates tax-free.

After the elimination of many tax shelters by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the sale of single-premium life insurance accelerated significantly because investors found this product to be an attractive tax shelter.

Large amounts could be paid as a premium, the earnings grew tax-free, and the owner could borrow up to the cash value without a tax liability. Single premium life insurance, thus, generated significant tax-sheltered investment income.

In 1988 (via the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 [TAMRA]), Congress developed a new policy to discourage the use of life insurance contracts with large premiums as an investment tax shelter. The test embodied in this policy was called the seven-pay test. Consider first the effect of not meeting the seven pay test, and then the test itself.

If an insurance policy did not meet the seven-pay test at time of issue, it was deemed to be a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC) and the tax advantages were reduced as follows. MECs have two important tax disadvantages relative to standard life insurance policies (non-MECs). First, policy loans on a MEC are made on a LIFO (last in-first out) basis—that is, the investment earnings, not the cost basis, is borrowed first and is taxable. The remainder of the loan up to the cash value of the policy is the cost basis and not subject to tax. Second, MECs are subject to a  $10\%$  penalty on any taxable gains borrowed before age  $59 \frac{1}{2}$  (similar provisions exist on annuities, as discussed in a later section).

Next consider the seven-pay test for determining whether the policy is a MEC. The seven-pay test is an artificial standard developed by the IRS based on the level premium concept. First, the premium for a level premium seven-year paid policy is calculated. The test or standard for determining whether an insurance policy is a MEC is that the premium actually paid on the policy during the first seven years cannot be greater than the seven-year pay level on a year-by-year basis. For example, if the seven-year pay amount calculated is  $1,000 per year for seven years, the premium paid can be no more than$ 1,000 during the first year; similarly no more than $2,000 during the first two years; and up to $7,000 during the first seven years. If the actual premiums paid are greater than any of these amounts, the policy is a MEC. Whether or not a policy is a MEC should be determined and be divulged to the policy owner before the policy is written.

If a policy is deemed a MEC when it is written, it remains a MEC throughout its life. However, a policy which is initially a non-MEC can be subsequently deemed to be a MEC if premium payments accelerate.

The following illustrates the difference in the taxation of a MEC and a non-MEC.

Cash Value: 100

Premium Paid: 20

Earnings: 80

# 1. Non-MEC

■ Loan up to 100 is non-taxable (that is, neither premium paid nor earnings is taxable)

Rationale: withdrawal is a loan, not a distribution (i.e., not included in income)

# 2. MEC

Borrow earnings (80) first—is taxable

Then borrow premium paid (20)—is not taxable

The characteristics of MECs and non-MECs are summarized in Exhibit 24.7. It is important to note that MECs have no disadvantage if the policy owner does not borrow against the policy. The MEC condition serves only to disadvantage policy loans in an insurance contract.

# INVESTMENT-ORIENTED LIFE INSURANCE

The major investment-oriented insurance products can be divided into two categories—cash value life insurance and annuities. Each has several types, which are listed in Exhibit 24.4. These products are described in the following sections.

# Cash Value Life Insurance

Cash value life insurance has been introduced above. There are two dimensions of cash value life insurance policies. The first is whether the cash value is guaranteed (called whole life) or variable (called variable life). The second is whether the required premium payment is fixed or flexible, that is whether it has a universal (flexible) feature or not. They can be combined in all ways. Thus, there are four combinations, which we discuss next. The broad classification of cash value life insurance, called whole life insurance, in addition to providing pure life insurance (as does term insurance), builds up a cash value or investment value inside the policy.

Traditional cash value life insurance, usually called whole life insurance, has a guaranteed buildup of cash value based on the investment returns on the general account portfolio of the insurance company. That is, the cash value in the policy is guaranteed to increase by a specified minimum amount each year. This is called the cash value buildup. (The guaranteed cash value buildup of many U.S. CVWLI policies tend to be in the range of  $3\% - 4\%$ .) The cash value may grow by more than this minimum amount if a dividend is paid on the policy. Dividends, however, are not guaranteed. There are two types of dividends, participating and nonparticipating. Participating dividends depend on (that is, participate in) the investment returns of the general account of the insurance company portfolio (the insurance company M&E charges also affect the dividend).

The participating dividend may be used to increase the cash value of the policy by more than its guaranteed amount. Actually, there are two potential uses of the dividend. The first is to reduce the annual premium paid on the policy. In this case, while the premium decreases, the cash value of the policy increases by only its guaranteed amount (and the face value the death benefit remains constant).

The second use is to buy more life insurance with the premium (called "paid up additions" [PUA]). In this case, the cash value of the entire policy increases by more than the guaranteed amount on the original policy (and the face value of the current policy is greater than the face value of the original policy).

In either case, the performance of the policy over time may be substantially affected by the participating dividends.

Contrary to the guaranteed or fixed cash value policies based on the general account portfolio of the insurance company, variable life insurance policies allow the policyowners to allocate their premium payments to and among several separate investment accounts maintained by the insurance company, and also to be able to shift the policy cash value among these separate accounts. As a result, the amount of the policy cash value depends on the investment results of the separate accounts the policyowners have selected. Thus, there is no guaranteed cash value or death benefit. Both depend on the performance of the selected investment portfolio.

The types of separate account investment options offered in their variable life insurance policies vary by insurance companies. Typically, the insurance company offers a selection of common stock and bond fund investment opportunities, often managed by the company itself and also by other investment managers. If the investment options perform well, the cash value buildup in the policy will be significant. However, if the policyholder selects investment options that perform poorly, the variable life insurance policy will perform poorly. There could be little or no cash value buildup, or, in the worst case, the policy could be terminated because there is not enough value in the contract to pay the mortality charge. This type of cash value life insurance is called variable life insurance. Variable life insurance, mainly their common stock investment options, grew quickly during the stock market rally of the 1990s.

The key element of universal life is the flexibility of the premium for the policyowner. The flexible premium concept separates the pure insurance protection (term insurance) from the investment (cash value) element of the policy. The policy cash value is set up as a cash value fund (or accumulation fund) to which the investment income is credited and from which the cost of term insurance for the insured (the mortality charge) is debited. The policy expenses are also debited.

This separation of the cash value from the pure insurance is called the "unbundling" of the traditional life insurance policy. Premium payments for universal life are at the discretion of the policyholder, that is, are flexible with the exceptions that there must be a minimum initial premium to begin the coverage, and there must also be a least enough cash value in the policy each month to cover the mortality charge and other expenses. If not, the policy will lapse. Both guaranteed cash value and variable life can be written on a flexible premium or fixed premium basis.

The universal feature—flexible premiums—can be applied to either guaranteed value whole life (called simply universal life) or to variable life (called variable universal life). These types are summarized in Exhibit 24.8. Variable universal life insurance combines the features of variable life and universal life policies—that is, the choice of separate account investment products and flexible premiums.

Over the last decade, term and variable life insurance have been growing at the expense of whole life insurance. The most common form of variable life is variable universal.

EXHIBIT 24.8 Types of Universal Life

<table><tr><td>Premium</td><td>Guaranteed</td><td>Variable</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed</td><td>Whole Life</td><td>Variable Life</td></tr><tr><td>Flexible</td><td>Universal Life</td><td>Variable Universal Life</td></tr></table>

Most whole life insurance policies are designed to pay death benefits when one specified insured dies. An added dimension of whole life policies is that two people (usually a married couple) are jointly insured, and the policy pays the death benefit not when the first person dies, but when the second person (the "surviving spouse") dies. This is called survivorship insurance or second-to-die insurance. This survivorship feature can be added to standard cash value whole life, universal life, variable life, and variable universal life policies. Thus, each of the four policies discussed could also be written on a survivorship basis.

In general, the annual premium for a survivorship insurance policy is lower than for a policy on a single person because, by construction, the second of two people to die has a longer life span than the first. Of the total survivorship sales during the first quarter of 2000,  $46\%$  was based on variable universal life,  $33\%$  on universal life, and  $21\%$  on whole life. Survivorship insurance is typically sold for estate planning purposes.

Exhibit 24.9 provides a summary of the various types of cash value life insurance, with (annual renewable) term insurance included for contrast.

# Uses of Life Insurance

The standard use of life insurance is to protect the survivors of an income earner. In this case, the insured is the income earner and the survivors are the beneficiaries. This is still a major use of life insurance. For this use, life insurance protects against premature death.

There are, however, many other uses. The life insurance death benefits are used to pay the estate taxes on the deceased's assets in their estate. There are also many business uses of life insurance. Split dollar life insurance, whereby the business pays for a portion or all of the premium on a life insurance policy on the executive, is used as a fringe benefit for its executives. Life insurance policies may also be written on both participants in a partnership to fund the purchase by the surviving partner of the ownership of the deceased partner according to a buy-sell agreement. There are also other business uses of life insurance.

# Annuities

By definition, an annuity is simply a series of periodic payments. Annuity contracts have been offered by insurance companies and, more recently, by other types of financial institutions such as mutual fund companies.

There are two components to annuities according to cash flows, the accumulation period and the liquidation period. During the accumulation period, the investor is providing funds, or investing. Annuities are considered primarily accumulation products rather than insurance products. During the liquidation period, the investor is withdrawing funds, or liquidating the annuity. One type of liquidation is annuitiza tion, or withdrawal via a series of fixed payments, as discussed below. This method of liquidation is the basis for the name of annuities.

There are several ways to classify annuities. One is the method of paying premiums. Annuities are purchased with single premiums, fixed periodic premiums, or flexible periodic premiums during the accumulation phase. All three are used in current practice.

A second classification is the time the income payments commence during the liquidation phase. An immediate annuity is one in which the first benefit payment is due one payment interval (month, year or other) from the purchasing date. Under a deferred annuity, there is a longer period before the benefit period begins. While an immediate annuity is purchased with a single premium, a deferred annuity may be purchased with a single, fixed periodic, or flexible periodic payments, although the flexible periodic payment is most common.

An important basis for annuities is whether they are fixed or variable annuities. Fixed annuities, as discussed in more detail below, are expressed in a fixed number of dollars, while variable annuities are expressed in a fixed number annuity units, each unit of which may have a different and changing market value. Fixed versus variable annuities is the key distinction between annuities currently provided.

Now we will look at the various types of annuities. The most common categories are variable annuities and fixed annuities.

While cash value life insurance has the appearance of life insurance with an investment feature, annuities, in contrast, have the appearance of an investment product with an insurance feature. The major advantage of an annuity is its inside buildup, that is, its investment earnings are tax deferred. However, unlike life insurance where the death benefit is not subject to income taxes, withdrawals from annuities are taxable. There are also restrictions on withdrawals. Specifically, there are IRS requirements for the taxability of early withdrawals (before age  $59 \frac{1}{2}$ ) and required minimum withdrawals (after age  $70 \frac{1}{2}$ ). These requirements and the other tax issues of annuities are very complex and considered only briefly here.

The most common types of annuities, variable and fixed annuities, are discussed below.

# Variable Annuities

Variable annuities, initiated in the United States during 1952, are, in many ways, similar to mutual funds. Given the above discussion, variable annuities are often considered to be "mutual funds in an insurance wrapper." The return on a variable annuity depends on the return of the underlying portfolio. The returns on annuities are, thus, in a word, "variable." In fact, many investment managers offer similar or identical funds separately in both a mutual fund and an annuity format. Thus, variable annuity offerings are approximately as broad as mutual fund offerings. For example, consider a large capitalization, blended stock fund. The investment manager may offer this fund in both a mutual fund and annuity format. But, of course, the two portfolios are segregated. The portfolios of these two products may be identical and, thus, the portfolio returns will be identical.

Before considering the differences, however, there is one similarity. Investments in both mutual funds and annuities are made with after-tax dollars; that is, taxes are paid on the income before it is invested in either a mutual fund or an annuity.

But there are important differences to investors in these two products. First, all income (dividend and interest) and realized capital gains generated in the mutual fund are taxable, even if the switch is not withdrawn. On the other hand, income and realized capital gains generated in the annuity are not taxable until withdrawn. Thus, annuities benefit from the same inside buildup as cash value life insurance.

There is another tax advantage to annuities. If a variable annuity company has a group of annuities in its family (called a "contract"), an investor can switch from one annuity fund to another in the contract (for example from a stock fund to a bond fund) and the switch is not a taxable event. However, if the investor shifts from a stock fund in one annuity company to a bond fund in another annuity company, it is considered a withdrawal and a reinvestment, and the withdrawal is a taxable event (there are exceptions to this, however, as will be discussed). The taxation of annuity withdrawals will also be considered.

While the inside buildup is an advantage of annuities, there are offsetting disadvantages. For comparison, there are no restrictions on withdrawals from (selling shares of) a mutual fund. Of course, withdrawals from a mutual fund are a taxable event and will generate realized capital gains or losses, which will generate long-term or short-term gains or losses and, thus, tax consequences. There are, however, significant restrictions on withdrawals from annuities. First, withdrawals before age  $59 \frac{1}{2}$  are assessed a  $10\%$  penalty (there are, however, some "hardship" exceptions to this). Second, withdrawals must begin by age  $70 \frac{1}{2}$  according to the IRS required minimum distribution rules (RMD). These mandatory withdrawals are designed to eventually produce tax revenues on annuities to the IRS. Mutual funds have no disadvantages to withdrawing before  $59 \frac{1}{2}$  nor requirements to withdraw after  $70 \frac{1}{2}$ .

There is an exception to the taxation resulting from a shift of funds from one variable annuity company to another. Under specific circumstances, funds can be so moved without causing a taxable event. Such a shift is called a 1035 exchange after the IRS rule that permits this transfer.

Another disadvantage of annuities is that all gains on withdrawals, when they occur, are taxed as ordinary income, not capital gains, whether their source was income or capital gains. For many investors, their income tax rate is significantly higher than the long-term capital gains tax rate and this form of taxation is therefore a disadvantage.

The final disadvantage of annuities is that the heirs of a deceased owner receive them with a cost basis equal to the purchase price (which means that the gains are taxed at the heir's ordinary income tax rate) rather than being stepped up to a current market value as with most investments.

Why has the IRS given annuities the same tax advantage of inside buildup that insurance policies have? The answer to this question is that annuities are structured to have some of the characteristics of life insurance, commonly called "features." There are many such features. The most common feature is that the minimum value of an annuity fund that will be paid at the investor's death is the initial amount invested. Thus, if an investor invests  $100 in a stock annuity, the stock market declines such that the value of the fund is$ 90, and the investor dies, the investor's beneficiary will receive $100, not $90. This is a life insurance characteristic of an annuity.

The above feature represents a death benefit (DB), commonly called a return of premium. However, new, and often more complicated, death benefits have been introduced, including a periodic lock-in of gains (called a "stepped up" DB); a predetermined annual percentage increase (called a "rising floor" DB); or a percentage of earnings to offset estate taxes and other death expenses (called an "earnings enhancement" DB). In addition to these death benefit features, some living benefit features have also been developed, including premium enhancements and minimum accumulation guarantees.

Obviously these features have value to the investor and, as a result, a cost to the provider. The value of a feature depends on its design and can be high or approximately worthless. And the annuity company will charge the investor for the value of these features.

The cost of the features relates to another disadvantage of annuities, specifically their expenses. The insurance company will impose a charge for the potential death benefit payment (called mortality) and other expenses, overall called M&E charges, as discussed previously for insurance policies. These M&E charges will be in addition to the normal investment management, custody, and other expenses experienced by mutual funds. Thus, annuity expenses will exceed mutual fund expenses by the annuity's M&E charges. The annuity investor does, however, receive the value of the insurance feature for the M&E charge.

Thus, the overall tradeoffs between mutual funds and annuities can be summarized as follows. Annuities have the advantages of inside buildup and the particular life insurance features of the specific annuity. But annuities also have the disadvantages of higher taxes on withdrawal (ordinary income versus capital gains), restrictions on withdrawals, and higher expenses. For short holding periods, mutual funds will have a higher after-tax return. For very long holding periods, the value of the inside buildup will dominate and the annuity will have a higher after-tax return.

What is the breakeven holding period, that is, the holding period beyond which annuities have higher after-tax returns? The answer to this question depends on several factors, such as the tax rates (income and capital gains), the excess of the expenses on the annuity, and others. The conventional wisdom is that this breakeven period is currently in the range of 7 to 10 years.[7]

# Fixed Annuities

There are several types of fixed annuities but, in general, the invested premiums grow at a rate—the credited rate—specified by the insurance company in each. This growth is accrued and added to the cash value of the annuity each year (or more frequently, such as monthly) and is not taxable as long as it remains in the annuity. Upon liquidation, it is taxed as ordinary income (to the extent that is represents previously untaxed income).

The two most common types of fixed annuities are the flexible premium deferred annuity (FPDA) and the single premium deferred annuity (SPDA). The FPDA permits contributions which are flexible in amount and timing. The interest rate paid on these contracts—the credited rate—varies and depends on the insurance company's current interest earnings and its desired competitive position in the market. There are, however, two types of limits on the rate. First, the rate is guaranteed to be no lower than a specified contract guaranteed rate, often in the range  $3\%$  to  $4\%$ . Second, these contracts often have bail-out provisions, which stipulate that if the credited rate decreases below a specified rate, the owner may withdraw all the funds (lapse the contract) without a surrender charge. Bail-out credited rates are often set at  $1\%$  to  $3\%$  below the current credited rate and are designed to limit the use of a "teaser rate" (or "bait and switch" practices), whereby an insurance company offers a high credited rate to attract new investors and then reduces the credited rate significantly, with the investor limited from withdrawing the funds by the surrender charges.

An initial credited rate, a minimum guaranteed rate, and a bailout rate are set initially on the contract. The initial credited rate, thus, may be changed by the insurance company over time. The reset (or renewal) period must also be specified—this is, the frequency with which the credited rate can be changed.

Another important characteristic of annuities is the basis for the valuation of withdrawals prior to maturity. The traditional method has been book value, that is, withdrawals are paid based on the purchase price of the bonds (bonds rather than stocks are used to fund annuities). Thus, if yields have increased, the insurance company will be paying the withdrawing investor more than the bonds are currently worth. And at this time, there is an incentive for the investor to withdraw and invest in a new higher yielding fixed annuity. Thus, book value fixed annuities provide risk to the insurance company. Surrender charges, discussed next, mitigate this risk. Another way to mitigate this risk is via market value adjusted (MVA) annuities, whereby early withdrawals are paid on the basis of the current market value of the bond portfolio rather than the book value. This practice eliminates the early withdrawal risk to the insurance company. (Obviously, all variable annuities are paid on the basis of market value rather than bonds value.)

While book value annuities were originally the entire fixed annuity market and remain the largest part of the market, MVA annuities have grown considerably in the last decade.[8]

Another characteristic of both variable and fixed annuities relates to one aspect of their sales charges. These charges are very similar for annuities and mutual funds. Mutual funds and annuities were originally provided with front-end loans, that is, sales charges imposed on the initial investment. For example, with a  $5 \%$  front-end load of a  $\$ 100$  initial investment,  $\$ 5$  would be retained by the firm for itself and the agent, and  $\$ 95$  invested in the fund for the investor.

More recently, back-end loads have been used as an alternative to front-end loads. With a back-end load, the fixed percentage charge is imposed at the time of withdrawal. Currently, the most common form of back-end load is the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), also called simply a surrender charge. This approach imposes a load which is gradually declining over time. For example, a common CDSC is a " $7\% / 6\% / 5\% / 4\% / 3\% / 2\% / 1\% / 0\%$ " charge according to which a  $7\%$  load is imposed on withdrawals during the first year,  $6\%$  during the second year,  $5\%$  during the third year, and so forth. There is no charge for withdrawals after the seventh year.

Finally, there are level loads, which impose a constant load (1\% for example) every year. Currently on annuities, a front-end load is often used along with a CDSC surrender charge.

Annuities have become very complex instruments. This section provides only an overview.

# GICS

The first major investment-oriented product developed by life insurance companies, and a form of fixed annuity, was the guaranteed investment contract (GIC). GICs were used extensively for retirement plans. With a GIC, a life insurance company agrees, in return for a single premium, to pay the principal amount and a predetermined annual crediting rate over the life of the investment, all of which are paid at the maturity date of the GIC. For example, a $10 million five-year GIC with a predetermined crediting rate of 10\% means that at the end of five years, the insurance company pays the guaranteed crediting rate and the principal. The return of the principal depends on the ability of the life insurance company to satisfy the obligation, just as in any corporate debt obligation. The risk that the insurer faces is that the rate earned on the portfolio of supporting assets is less than the guaranteed rate.

The maturity of a GIC can vary from 1 year to 20 years. The interest rate guaranteed depends on market conditions and the rating of the life insurance company. The interest rate will be higher than the yield on U.S. Treasury securities of the same maturity. These policies are typically purchased by pension plan sponsors as a pension investment.

A GIC is a liability of the life insurance company issuing the contract. The word guarantee does not mean that there is a guarantor other than the life insurance company. Effectively, a GIC is a zero-coupon bond issued by a life insurance company and, as such, exposes the investor to the same credit risk. This credit risk has been highlighted by the default of several major issuers of GICs. The two most publicized defaults were Mutual Benefit, a New Jersey-based insurer, and Executive Life, a California-based insurer, which were both seized by regulators in 1991.

The basis for these defaults is that fixed annuities are insurance company general account products and variable annuities are separate account products. For fixed annuities, the premiums become part of the insurance company, are invested in the insurance company's general account (which are regulated by state laws), and the payments are the obligations of the insurance company. Variable annuities are separate account products, that is, the premiums are deposited in investment vehicles separate from the insurance company, and are usually selected by the investor. Thus, fixed annuities are general account products and the insurance company bears the investment risk, while variable annuities are separate account products and the investor bears the investment risk.

# SPDAs and GICs

SPDAs and GICs with the same maturity and crediting rate have much in common. For example, for each the value of a $1 initial investment with a 5-year maturity and a fixed crediting rate for the five years at  $r\%$  would have a value at maturity of  $(1 + r)^{5}$ .

However, there are also significant differences. SPDAs have elements of an insurance product and so its inside buildup is not taxed as earned (it is taxed as income at maturity). SPDAs are not qualified products, that is, they must be paid for in after tax-dollars. GICs are not insurance products. GICs, however, are typically put into pension plans (defined benefit or defined contribution), which are qualified. In this case, thus, the GIC investments are paid for in after-tax dollars and receive the tax deferral of inside buildup. SPDAs are also put into qualified plans. Specifically, banks often sell IRAs funded with SPDAs.

Another difference between SPDAs and GICs is that since SPDAs are annuities, they usually have surrender charges, typically the  $7\% / 6\% / 5\% / 4\% / 3\% / 2\% / 1\% / 0\%$ , mentioned previously. Thus, if a 5-year SPDA is withdrawn after three years, there is a  $4\%$  surrender charge. GICs do not have surrender charges and can be withdrawn with no penalty (under benefit responsive provisions).

Another feature of SPDAs is the reset period, the period after which the credited rate can be changed by the writer of the product. For example, a 5-year SPDA may have a reset period after three years, at which time the credited rate can also be increased or decreased. For SPDAs, there can also be an interaction between the reset period and the surrender charge. For example, a 5-year SPDA with a 3-year reset period could be liquidated after 3 years due to a lowered crediting rate, but only with a  $4\%$  surrender charge. GICs have no reset period, that is, the credited rate is constant throughout the contract's life. Early withdrawals of GICs are at book value; they are interest rate insensitive.

SPDAs typically have a reset period of 1 year but with an initial M-year minimum guarantee  $(\mathrm{M} = 1,2,3,5,7,9)$ . SPDAs typically have a maturity based on the age of the annuitant (such as age 90 or 95), not a fixed number of years. Thus, while SPDAs typically have a maturity greater than the guarantee period, for GICs the maturity period equals the guarantee period. Common maturities for GICs and SPDAs are 1, 3, 5, and 7 years.

# Amrutization

Strictly speaking, an annuity is a guaranteed (or fixed) amount of periodic income for life. Both are accumulation products rather than income products. Either product can, however, be annuitized—that is, converted into a guaranteed lifetime income. Annuitization refers to the liquidation rather than the accumulation period. As a matter of fact, very few—less than  $1\%$ —of variable annuities are annuitized. One reason that few investors annuitize is that they fear they will die early and receive very little for the initial investment. On the other hand, the risk to individuals is that they will outlive their savings. Annuitization eliminates this risk. Traditionally, defined benefit retirement plans have provided a lifetime flow of income. But with the decline in defined benefit retirement plans, annuities can fill this vacuum.

Since the fixed payments of an annuity are for life, there is mortality risk for the annuity writer. If the annuitant dies soon, the payout by the annuity writer will be small. However, if the annuitant lives a long life, the payments by the annuity writer will be large. This characteristic introduces an underwriting element to annuities by the annuity writer. Some fixed annuities also have a survivorship feature. That is, when the annuitant dies, the payments will continue and be paid to a named survivor, usually a spouse.

Many variable annuity owners who wish to annuitize elect for a variation on a strict annuity called a systematic withdrawal plan (SWP) instead. While there are many types of SWPs, the most common type is based on a specified term rather than lifetime payments in order to assure that the payments last at least a certain amount of time (called a period-certain payout option). These plans, thus, do not eliminate the risk of outliving one's savings. Under a SWP, annuity shares are liquidated to pay regular payments that are either a fixed dollar amount or a percentage of the investor's account balance. Thus, unlike annuitization, SWPs cause a continual decline in the investor's account balance. There are also variations of the standard lifetime payout option which include life with a guaranteed period, joint and survivor life, and joint and survivor life with a guaranteed period.

# SUMMARY

Fundamentally, insurance and investment products are distinct. Insurance products provide risk protection against a wide variety of risks and have no cash value. Investment products, often called accumulation products, provide returns on an initial investment.

However, two types of products provide elements of both insurance and investments. These two are cash value life insurance and annuities. Cash value life insurance is a combination of pure life insurance with a buildup of cash value as a result of the higher premium paid relative to a pure life insurance policy. The types of cash value life insurance include whole life and variable life, and universal versions of both of these.

The second type is annuities. There are two types of annuities, variable and fixed. Variable annuities are essentially mutual funds in an insurance wrapper. The insurance elements may include both death benefits and living benefits. The returns on variable annuities depend on the particular type of investment portfolio selected by the investor.

Fixed annuities are a guaranteed yield over an investment term. The return over the term is specified at the time of the investment and is certain. Very few annuities, variable or fixed, are annuitized, that is, converted into a lifetime stream of fixed payments, despite the attractive characteristics of annuitization.

The investment element of these hybrid insurance/investment products benefits from their tax advantages. The major tax advantage of both of these types of investment-oriented insurance products is inside buildup, although the cash value life insurance products also have other significant tax benefits. Congress provided the tax advantages to these products due to their insurance characteristics, not their investment characteristics. There are, as a result, limits on the investment characteristics of these hybrid products to qualify them for the tax advantages.

The term "hedge fund" is a term of art. It is not defined in the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Additionally, "hedge fund" is not defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Commodity Exchange Act, or, finally, the Bank Holding Company Act. So what is this investment vehicle that every investor seems to know about but for which there is scant regulatory guidance?

As a starting point, we turn to the American Heritage Dictionary (third edition) which defines a hedge fund as:

An investment company that uses high-risk techniques, such as borrowing money and selling short, in an effort to make extraordinary capital gains.

Not a bad start, but we note that hedge funds are not investment companies, for they would be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Additionally, some hedge funds, such as market neutral and market timing have con servative risk profiles and do not "swing for the fences" to earn extraordinary gains.

We define hedge funds as:

A privately organized investment vehicle that manages a concentrated portfolio of public securities and derivative instruments on public securities, that can invest both long and short, and can apply leverage.

Within this definition there are five key elements of hedge funds that distinguish them from their more traditional counterpart, the mutual fund.

First, hedge funds are private investment vehicles that pool the resources of sophisticated investors. One of the ways that hedge funds avoid the regulatory scrutiny of the SEC or the CFTC is that they are available only for high net worth investors. Under SEC rules, hedge funds cannot have more than 100 investors in the fund. Alternatively, hedge funds may accept an unlimited number of "qualified purchasers" in the fund. These are individuals or institutions that have a net worth in excess of $5,000,000.

There is a penalty, however, for the privacy of hedge funds. Although they may escape the regulatory burden of U.S. agencies, they cannot raise funds from investors via a public offering. Additionally, hedge funds may not advertise broadly or engage in a general solicitation for new funds. Instead, their marketing and fundraising efforts must be targeted to a narrow niche of very wealthy individuals and institutions. As a result, the predominant investors in hedge funds are family offices, endowments, and, to a lesser extent, pension funds.

Second, hedge funds tend to have portfolios that are much more concentrated than their mutual fund brethren. Most hedge funds do not have broad securities benchmarks. The reason is that most hedge fund managers claim that their style of investing is "skill-based" and cannot be measured by a market return. Consequently, hedge fund managers are not forced to maintain security holdings relative to a benchmark; they do not need to worry about "benchmark" risk. This allows them to concentrate their portfolio only on those securities that they believe will add value to the portfolio.

Another reason for the concentrated portfolio is that hedge fund managers tend to have narrow investment strategies. These strategies tend to focus on only one sector of the economy or one segment of the market. They can tailor their portfolio to extract the most value from their smaller investment sector or segment.

Third, hedge funds tend to use derivative strategies much more predominately than mutual funds. Indeed, in some strategies, such as con vertible arbitrage, the ability to sell or buy options is a key component of executing the arbitrage. The use of derivative strategies may result in non-linear cash flows that may require more sophisticated risk management techniques to control these risks.

Fourth, hedge funds may go both long and short securities. The ability to short public securities and derivative instruments is one of the key distinctions between hedge funds and traditional money managers. Hedge fund managers incorporate their ability to short securities explicitly into their investment strategies. For example, equity long/short hedge funds tend to buy and sell securities within the same industry to maximize their return but also to control their risk. This is very different from traditional money managers that are tied to a long-only securities benchmark.

Finally, hedge funds use leverage, sometimes, large amounts. Mutual funds, for example, are limited in the amount of leverage they can employ; they may borrow up to  $33\%$  of their net asset base. Hedge funds do not have this restriction. Consequently, it is not unusual to see some hedge fund strategies that employ leverage up to 10 times their net asset base.

We can see that hedge funds are different than traditional long-only investment managers. We next discuss the history of the hedge fund development.

# HEDGE FUND REGULATION

Hedge funds are often referred to as "unregulated" investment vehicles—investment funds that manage to stay outside the reach of the securities laws. The fact is that hedge fund managers take advantage of ready-made exemptions that are part of the securities laws themselves. We briefly summarize how hedge fund managers avail themselves of these regulatory "safe harbors."

# The Securities Act of 1933

The Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") was born out of the Great Depression. With the collapse of the stock market in 1929, and the economic depression that followed, Congress sought to make the financial markets a safer place for investors. The 1933 Act was enacted to regulate the initial sale of securities to investors. Under the 1933 Act, the issuer of securities must file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and provide investors with a prospectus.

One way to avoid the lengthy registration process is to find an exemption from registration within the 1933 Act. Under the 1933 Act,

Congress provided issuers with an exemption from the registration process titled: "The Rules Governing the Limited Offer and Sale of Securities Without Registration under the Securities Act of 1933." These rules are universally known as "Regulation D." Under Rule 506 of Regulation D, a hedge fund manager can sell its limited partnership interests to an unlimited number of "accredited investors" (essentially sophisticated or high net worth investors), and to no more than 35 non-accredited investors.

# The Investment Company Act of 1940

The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Company Act") was designed to regulate investment pools. Today, this act primarily regulates the mutual fund industry. Mutual funds are investment companies for purposes of the Company Act and the SEC.

Under Section 3(a) of the Company Act, an investment company:

Means any issuer which is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities.

While this definition clearly incorporates mutual funds, it is also broad enough to encompass hedge funds. Hedge funds are investment companies for purposes of the Company Act. Falling within the jurisdiction of the Company Act means that hedge funds must adhere to the same registration requirements under Section 8 of the Company Act as do mutual funds.

However, the Company Act also provides two ready-made safe harbors of which hedge fund managers may take advantage.

First, Section 3(c)(1) of the Company Act states that an investment pool can be offered to any type of investor, sophisticated and unsophisticated, accredited and nonaccredited, provided that the hedge fund manager does not allow more than 100 investors into the fund. For smaller hedge fund managers, the 100-person limit should not be an issue. For larger hedge funds, however, that wish to attract additional capital, the 100-person limit may prove binding.

In 1996, Congress added a new paragraph 7 to Section 3(c) of the Company Act. This paragraph recognizes that an investment pool might contain many investors that are sophisticated, and consequently, might not need the oversight of the SEC.

This new type of fund is often referred to as a "3(c)(7) fund," and it is designed for sophisticated investors. Section 3(c)(7) imposes no limit on the number of investors, provided that the investors are all "Qualifield Purchasers" (generally, investors with a net worth of at least $5 million) as defined by the Company Act.

# HEDGE FUND STRATEGIES

Hedge funds invest in the same equity and fixed income securities as traditional long-only managers. Therefore, it is not the alternative "assets" in which hedge funds invest that differentiates them from long-only managers, but rather, it is the alternative investment strategies that they pursue.

In this section we review several alternative strategies that hedge funds apply. In general, some hedge funds have considerable exposure to the financial markets. This would be the long/short, global macro hedge fund or short selling players. Other hedge funds take little market exposure, but use leverage to magnify the size of their bets. These are the arbitrage hedge funds. Last there are hedge fund strategies that take little credit or market risk. These are the market neutral and market timing strategies.

# Equity Long/Short

Equity long/short managers build their portfolios by combining a core group of long stock positions with short sales of stock or stock index options/futures. Their net market exposure of long positions minus short positions tends to have a positive bias. That is, equity long/short managers tend to be long market exposure. The length of their exposure depends on current market conditions. For instance, during the great stock market surge of 1996-1999, these managers tended to be mostly long their equity exposure. However, as the stock market turned into a bear market in 2000, these managers decreased their market exposure as they sold more stock short or sold stock index options and futures.

For example, consider a hedge fund manager in 2000 who had a  $100\%$  long exposure to tobacco industry stocks and had a  $20\%$  short exposure to semiconductor stocks. The beta of the S&P Tobacco index is 0.5, and for the semiconductor index it is 1.5. The weighted average beta of the portfolio is:

$$
[ 1. 0 \times 0. 5 ] + [ - 0. 2 0 \times 1. 5 ] = 0. 2 0
$$

Beta is a well-known measure of market exposure (or systematic risk). A portfolio with a beta of 1.0 is considered to have the same stock market exposure or risk as a broad-based stock index such as the S&P 500.

According to the Capital Asset Pricing Model, the hedge fund manager has a conservative portfolio. The expected return of this portfolio according the model is:2

$$
6 \% + 0.20 \times (-9.5 \% - 6 \%) = 2.9 \%
$$

However, in 2000, the total return on the S&P Tobacco Index was  $98\%$  while for the semiconductor index it was  $-31\%$ . This "conservative" hedge fund portfolio would have earned the following return in 2000:

$$
[ 1.0 \times 98\% ] + [ - 0.20 \times -31\% ] = 104.20 \%
$$

This is a much higher return than that predicted by the Capital Asset Pricing Model.

This example serves to highlight two points. First, the ability to go both long and short in the market is a powerful tool for earning excess returns. The ability to fully implement a strategy not only about stocks and sectors that are expected to increase in value but also stocks and sectors that are expected to decrease in value allows the hedge fund manager to maximize the value of his market insights.

Second, the long/short nature of the portfolio can be misleading with respect to the risk exposure. This manager is  $80\%$  net long. Additionally, the beta of the combined portfolio is only 0.20. From this an investor might conclude that the hedge fund manager is pursuing a low risk strategy. However, this is not true. What the hedge fund manager has done is to make two explicit bets: that tobacco stocks will appreciate in value and that semiconductor stocks will decline in value.

The Capital Asset Pricing Model assumes that investors hold a well-diversified portfolio. That is not the case with this hedge fund manager. Most hedge fund managers build concentrated rather than highly diversified portfolios. Consequently, traditional models (such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model) and associated risk measures (such as beta) may not apply to hedge fund managers.

Equity long/short hedge funds essentially come in two flavors: fundamental or quantitative. Fundamental long/short hedge funds conduct traditional economic analysis on a company's business prospects compared to its competitors and the current economic environment. These managers will visit with corporate management, talk with Wall Street analysts, contact customers and competitors, and essentially conduct bottom-up analysis. The difference between these hedge funds and long-only managers is that they will short the stocks that they consider to be poor performers and buy those stocks that are expected to outperform the market. In addition, they may leverage their long and short positions.

Fundamental long/short equity hedge funds tend to invest in one economic sector or market segment. For instance, they may specialize in buying and selling internet companies (sector focus) or buying and selling small market capitalization companies (segment focus).

In contrast, quantitative equity long/short hedge fund managers tend not to be sector or segment specialists. In fact, quite the reverse. Quantitative hedge fund managers like to cast as broad a net as possible in their analysis.

These managers use mathematical analysis to review past company performance in light of several quantitative factors. For instance, these managers may build regression models to determine the impact of market price to book value (price/book ratio) on companies across the universe of stocks as well as different market segments or economic sectors. Or, they may analyze changes in dividend yields on stock price performance.

Typically, these managers build multifactor models, both linear and quadratic, and then test these models on historical stock price performance. Backtesting involves applying the quantitative model on prior stock price performance to see if there is any predictive power in determining whether the stock of a particular company will rise or fall. If the model proves successful using historical data, the hedge fund manager will then conduct an "out of sample" test of the model. This involves testing the model on a subset of historical data that was not included in the model building phase.

If a hedge fund manager identifies a successful quantitative strategy, it will apply its model mechanically. Buy and sell orders will be generated by the model and submitted to the order desk. In practice, the hedge fund manager will put limits on its model such as the maximum short exposure allowed or the maximum amount of capital that may be committed to any one stock position. In addition, quantitative hedge fund managers usually build in some qualitative oversight to ensure that the model is operating consistently.

In Exhibit 25.1, a graph of a hypothetical investment of 1,000 in an Equity Long/Short fund of funds compared to the S&P 500 is provided. In this chapter, we use data from Hedge Fund Research, Inc. (HFRI), a database of about 1,100 hedge funds.^3 The time period is

1990 through 2000. As can be seen, the returns to this strategy were quite favorable compared to the stock market.

# Global Macro

As their name implies, global macro hedge funds take a macroeconomic approach on a global basis in their investment strategy. These are top-down managers who invest opportunistically across financial markets, currencies, national borders, and commodities. They take large positions depending upon the hedge fund manager's forecast of changes in interest rates, currency movements, monetary policies, and macroeconomic indicators.

Global macro managers have the broadest investment universe. They are not limited by market segment or industry sector, nor by geographic region, financial market, or currency. Additionally, global macro managers may invest in commodities. In fact, a fund of global macro hedge funds offers the greatest diversification of investment strategies.

Global macro funds tend to have large amounts of investor capital. This is necessary to execute their macroeconomic strategies. In addition, they may apply leverage to increase the size of their macro bets. As a result, global macro hedge funds tend to receive the greatest attention and publicity in the financial markets.

The best known of these hedge funds was the Quantum Hedge Fund managed by George Soros. It is well documented that this fund made significant gains in 1992 by betting that the British pound would devalue (which it did). This fund was also accused of contributing to the "Asian Contagion" in the fall of 1997 when the government of Thailand devalued its currency, the baht, triggering a domino effect in currency movements throughout southeast Asia.

EXHIBIT 25.2 HFRI Global Macro Index

In recent times, however, global macro funds have fallen on hard times. One reason is that many global macro funds were hurt by the Russian bond default in August 1998 and the bursting of the technology bubble in March 2000. These two events caused large losses for the global macro funds.

A second reason, as indicated above, is that global macro hedge funds had the broadest investment mandate of any hedge fund strategy. The ability to invest widely across currencies, financial markets, geographic borders, and commodities is a two-edged sword. On the one hand, it allows global macro funds the widest universe in which to implement their strategies. On the other hand, it lacks focus. As more institutional investors have moved into the hedge fund marketplace, they have demanded greater investment focus as opposed to free investment reign.

Exhibit 25.2 provides a comparison of global macro hedge funds to the S&P 500 over the period 1990-2000. During this time period global macro hedge funds earned favorable returns.

# Short Selling

Short selling hedge funds have the opposite exposure of traditional long-only managers. In that sense, their return distribution should be the mirror image of long-only managers: they make money when the stock market is declining and lose money when the stock market is gaining.

These hedge fund managers may be distinguished from equity long/ short managers in that they generally maintain a net short exposure to the stock market. However, short selling hedge funds tend to use some form of market timing. That is, they trim their short positions when the stock market is increasing and go fully short when the stock market is declining. When the stock market is gaining, short sellers maintain that portion of their investment capital not committed to short selling in short-term interest rate bearing accounts.

The past 10 years has seen predominantly a strong bull market in the United States. There have been some speed bumps: the short recession of 1990-1991 and the soft landing of 1994. But for the most part, the U.S. equity market has enjoyed strong returns in the 1990s. As a result, short sellers have had to seek other markets such as Japan, or result to more market timing to earn positive results. Later, when we review the distributions of hedge funds, we will see if short sellers have been successful in pursuing other markets or in market timing.

Exhibit 25.3 presents the returns to short selling hedge funds over the period 1990-2000. As might be expected, these hedge funds underperformed the S&P 500.

# Convertible Bond Arbitrage

Hedge fund managers tend to use the term "arbitrage" somewhat loosely. Arbitrage is defined simply as riskless profits. It is the purchase of a security for cash at one price and the immediate resale for cash of the same security at a higher price. Alternatively, it may be defined as the simultaneous purchase of security A for cash at one price and the selling of identical security B for cash at a higher price. In both cases, the arbitrageur has no risk. There is no market risk because the holding of the securities is instantaneous. There is no basis risk because the securities are identical, and there is no credit risk because the transaction is conducted in cash.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/34152bb9-0c82-464c-8d95-33ab992e7f99/d8ea6ec2bb7a1ed6b5497becc3de36a8a16209942f5860e0908662f4e27fc1f8.jpg)

EXHIBIT 25.3 HFRI Short Selling Index

Instead of riskless profits, in the hedge fund world, arbitrage is generally used to mean low risk investments. Instead of the purchase and sale of identical instruments, there is the purchase and sale of similar instruments. Additionally, the securities may not be sold for cash, so there may be credit risk during the collection period. Last, the purchase and sale may not be instantaneous. The arbitrageur may need to hold onto its positions for a period of time, exposing himself to market risk.

Convertible arbitrage funds build long positions of convertible bonds and then hedge the equity component of the bond by selling the underlying stock or options on that stock. Equity risk can be hedged by selling the appropriate ratio of stock underlying the convertible option. This hedge ratio is known as the "delta" and is designed to measure the sensitivity of the convertible bond value to movements in the underlying stock.

Convertible bonds that trade at a low premium to their conversion value tend to be more correlated with the movement of the underlying stock. These convertibles then trade more like stock than they do a bond. Consequently, a high hedge ratio, or delta, is required to hedge the equity risk contained in the convertible bond. Convertible bonds that trade at a premium to their conversion value are highly valued for their bond-like protection. Therefore, a lower delta hedge ratio is necessary.

However, convertible bonds that trade at a high conversion value act more like fixed-income securities and therefore have more interest rate exposure than those with more equity exposure. This risk must be managed by selling interest rate futures, interest rate swaps, or other bonds. Furthermore, it should be noted that the hedging ratios for equity and interest rate risk are not static; they change as the value of the underlying equity changes and as interest rates change. Therefore, the hedge fund manager must continually adjust his or her hedge ratios to ensure that the arbitrage remains intact.

If this all sounds complicated, it is, but that is how hedge fund managers make money. They use sophisticated option pricing models and interest rate models to keep track of the all of moving parts associated with convertible bonds. Hedge fund managers make arbitrage profits by identifying pricing discrepancies between the convertible bond and its component parts, and then continually monitoring these component parts for any change in their relationship.

Consider the following example. A hedge fund manager purchases 10 convertible bonds with a par value of 1,000, a coupon of 7.5\%, and a market price of 900. The conversion ratio for the bonds is 20. The conversion ratio is based on the current price of the underlying stock, 45, and the current price of the convertible bond. The delta, or hedge ratio for the bonds is 0.5. Therefore, to hedge the equity exposure in the convertible bond, the hedge fund manager must short the following shares of underlying stock:

10 bonds  $\times 20$  conversion ratio  $\times 0.5$  hedge ratio  $= 100$  shares of stock

To establish the arbitrage, the hedge fund manager purchases 10 convertible bonds and sells 100 shares of stock. With the equity exposure hedged, the convertible bond is transformed into a traditional fixed income instrument with a  $7.5\%$  coupon.

Additionally, the hedge fund manager earns interest on the cash proceeds received from the short sale of stock. This is known as the "short rebate." The cash proceeds remain with the hedge fund manager's prime broker, but the hedge fund manager is entitled to the interest earned on the cash balance from the short sale (a rebate). We assume that the hedge fund manager receives a short rebate of  $4.5\%$ . Therefore, if the hedge fund manager holds the convertible arbitrage position for one year, he expects to earn interest not only from his long bond position, but also from his short stock position.

The catch to this arbitrage is that the price of the underlying stock may change as well as the price of the bond. Assume the price of the stock increases to  $47 and the price of the convertible bond increases to$ 920. If the hedge fund manager does not adjust the hedge ratio during the holding period, the total return for this arbitrage will be:

Appreciation of bond price:  $10 \times ($ 920 - $900) = $200

Appreciation of stock price:  $100 \times ($ 45 - $47) = -$200

Interest on bonds:  $10 \times \$ 1,000 \times 7.5\% = \ $750$

Short rebate:  $100 \times \$ 45 \times 4.5\% = \ $202.50 / \$952.50$  Total:

If the hedge fund manager paid for the 10 bonds without using any leverage, the holding period return is:

$$
\$ 952.50 \div \$ 9000 = 10.58 \%
$$

However, suppose that the hedge fund manager purchased the convertible bonds with  $4,500 of initial capital and$ 4,500 of borrowed money. We suppose that the hedge fund manager borrows the additional investment capital from his prime broker at a prime rate of 6\%.

Our analysis of the total return is then:

Appreciation of bond price:  $10 \times ($ 920 - $900) = $200

Appreciation of stock price:  $100 \times ($ 47 - $45) = -$200

Interest on bonds:  $10 \times \$ 1,000 \times 7.5\% = \ $750$

Short rebate:  $100 \times \$ 45 \times 4.5\% = \ $202.5$

Interest on borrowing:  $6\% \times \$  4,500 = -\ $270$

Total:682.5

And the total return on capital is:

$$
\$ 682.5 \div \$ 4,500 = 15.17 \%
$$

The amount of leverage used in convertible arbitrage will vary with the size of the long positions and the objectives of the portfolio. Yet, in the above example, we can see how using a conservative leverage ratio of 2:1 in the purchase of the convertible bonds added almost 500 basis points of return to the strategy. It is easy to see why hedge fund managers are tempted to use leverage. Hedge fund managers earn incentive fees on every additional basis point of return they earn. Further, even though leverage is a two-edged sword—it can magnify losses as well as gains—hedge fund managers bear no loss if the use of leverage turns against them. In other words, hedge fund manages have everything to gain by applying leverage, but nothing to lose.

Additionally, leverage is inherent in the shorting strategy because the underlying equity stock must be borrowed to be shorted. Convertible arbitrage leverage can range from two to six times the amount of invested capital. This may seem significant, but it is lower than other forms of arbitrage.

Convertible bonds are subject to credit risk. This is the risk that the bonds will default, be downgraded, or that credit spreads will widen. There is also call risk. Last, there is the risk that the underlying company will be acquired or will acquire another company (i.e., event risk), both of which can have a significant impact on the company's stock price and credit rating. These events are only magnified when leverage is applied.

Exhibit 25.4 plots the value of convertible arbitrage strategies versus the S&P 500. Convertible arbitrage earns a consistent return but does not outperform stocks in strong bull equity markets.

# Fixed-Income Arbitrage

Fixed-income arbitrage involves purchasing one fixed-income security and simultaneously selling a similar fixed-income security. The sale of the second security is done to hedge the underlying market risk contained in the first security. Typically, the two securities are related either mathematically or economically such that they move similarly with respect to market developments. Generally, the difference in pricing between the two securities is small, and this is what the fixed income arbitrageur hopes to gain. By buying and selling two fixed income securities that are tied together, the hedge fund manager hopes to capture a pricing discrepancy that will cause the prices of the two securities to converge over time.

Fixed income arbitrage does not need to use exotic securities. It can be nothing more than buying and selling U.S. Treasury bonds. In the bond market, the most liquid securities are the on-the-run Treasury bonds. These are the most currently issued bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. However, there are other U.S. Treasury bonds outstanding that have very similar characteristics to the on-the-run Treasury bonds. The difference is that off-the-run bonds were issued at an earlier date, and are now less liquid than the on-the-run bonds. As a result, price discrepancies occur. The difference in price may be no more than one-half or one quarter of a point (25) but can increase in times of uncertainty when investor money shifts to the most liquid U.S. Treasury bond.

Nonetheless, when held to maturity, the prices of these two bonds should converge to their par value. Any difference will be eliminated by the time they mature, and any price discrepancy may be captured by the hedge fund manager. Fixed-income arbitrage is not limited to the U.S. Treasury market. It can be used with corporate bonds, municipal bonds, sovereign debt, or mortgage backed securities.

Fixed-income arbitrage may also include trading among fixed-income securities that are close in maturity. This is a form of yield curve arbitrage. These types of trades are usually driven by temporary imbalances in the term structure.

EXHIBIT 25.5 July 2000 Yield Curve

Consider Exhibit 25.5. This was the term structure for U.S. Treasury securities in July 2000. Notice that there are "kinks" in the term structure between the 3-month and the 5-year time horizon. Kinks in the yield curve can happen at any maturity and usually reflect an increase (or decrease) in liquidity demand around the focal point. These kinks provide an opportunity to profit by purchasing and selling Treasury securities that are similar in maturity.

Consider the kink that peaks at the 2-year maturity. The holder of the 2-year Treasury security profits by rolling down the yield curve. In other words, if interest rates remain static, the 2-year Treasury note will age into a lower yielding part of the yield curve. Moving down the yield curve will mean positive price appreciation. Conversely, Treasury notes in the 3to 5-year range will roll up the yield curve to higher yields. This means that their prices are expected to depreciate.

An arbitrage trade would be to purchase a 2-year Treasury note and short a 3-year note. As the 3-year note rolls up the yield curve, it should decrease in value while the 2-year note should increase in value as it rolls down the yield curve.

This arbitrage trade will work as long as the kink remains in place. However, this trade does have its risks. First, shifts in the yield curve up or down can affect the profitability of the trade because the two securities have different maturities. To counter this problem, the hedge fund manager would need to purchase and sell the securities in the proper proportion to neutralize the differences in duration. Also, liquidity preferences of investors could change. The kink could reverse itself, or flatten out. In either case, the hedge fund manager will lose money. Conversely, the liquidity preference of investors could increase, and the trade will become even more profitable.

A subset of fixed-income arbitrage uses mortgage-backed securities (MBS). MBS represent an ownership interest in an underlying pool of individual mortgage loans. Therefore, an MBS is a fixed-income security with underlying prepayment options. MBS hedge funds seek to capture pricing inefficiencies in the U.S. MBS market.

MBS arbitrage can be between fixed-income markets such as buying MBS and selling U.S. Treasuries. This investment strategy is designed to capture credit spread inefficiencies between U.S. Treasuries and MBS. MBS trade at a credit spread over U.S. Treasuries to reflect the uncertainty of cash flows associated with MBS compared to the certainty of cash flows associated with U.S. Treasury bonds.

As noted previously, during a flight to quality, investors tend to seek out the most liquid markets such as the on-the-run U.S. Treasury market. This may cause credit spreads to temporarily increase beyond what is historically or economically justified. In this case, the MBS market will be priced "cheap" to U.S. Treasuries. The arbitrage strategy would be to buy MBS and sell U.S. Treasury, where the interest rate exposure of both instruments is sufficiently similar so as to eliminate most (if not all) of the market risk between the two securities. The expectation is that the credit spread between MBS and U.S. Treasuries will decline and the MBS position will increase in value relative to U.S. Treasuries.

MBS arbitrage can be quite sophisticated. MBS hedge fund managers use proprietary models to rank the value of MBS by their option-adjusted spread (OAS). The hedge fund manager evaluates the present value of an MBS by explicitly incorporating assumptions about the probability of prepayment options being exercised. In effect, the hedge fund manager calculates the option-adjusted price of the MBS and compares it to its current market price. The OAS reflects the MBS' average spread over U.S. Treasury bonds of a similar maturity, taking into account the fact that the MBS may be liquidated early from the exercise of the prepayment option by the underlying mortgagors.

The MBS that have the best OAS compared to U.S. Treasuries are purchased, and then their interest rate exposure is hedged to zero. Interest rate exposure is neutralized using Treasury bonds, options, swaps, futures, and caps. MBS hedge fund managers seek to maintain a duration of zero. This allows them to concentrate on selecting the MBS that yield the highest OAS.

There are many risks associated with MBS arbitrage. Chief among them are duration, convexity, yield curve rotation, prepayment risk, credit risk (for private label MBS), and liquidity risk. Hedging these risks may require the purchase or sale of other MBS products such as interest-only strips and principal-only strips, inverse floaters, U.S. Treasuries, interest rate futures, swaps, and options.

EXHIBIT 25.6 HFRI Fixed-Income Arbitrage Index

What should be noted about fixed-income arbitrage strategies is that they do not depend on the direction of the general financial markets. Arbitrageurs seek out pricing inefficiencies between two securities instead of making bets on the market. Consequently, we do not expect fixed-income arbitrage strategies to have a high correlation with either stock market returns or bond market returns. Exhibit 25.6 demonstrates that fixed-income arbitrage earns a steady return year after year regardless of the movement of the stock market.

# Merger Arbitrage

Merger arbitrage is perhaps the best-known arbitrage among investors and hedge fund managers. Merger arbitrage generally entails buying the stock of the firm that is to be acquired and selling the stock of the firm that is the acquirer. Merger arbitrage managers seek to capture the price spread between the current market prices of the merger partners and the value of those companies upon the successful completion of the merger.

The stock of the target company will usually trade at a discount to the announced merger price. The discount reflects the risk inherent in the deal; other market participants are unwilling to take on the full exposure of the transaction-based risk. Merger arbitrage is then subject to event risk. There is the risk that the two companies will fail to come to terms and call off the deal. There is also the risk that another company will enter into the bidding contest, ruining the initial dynamics of the arbitrage. Last, there is regulatory risk. Various U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies may not allow the merger to take place for antitrust reasons. Merger arbitrageurs specialize in assessing event risk and building a diversified portfolio to spread out this risk.

Merger arbitrageurs conduct significant research on the companies involved in the merger. They will review current and prior financial statements, EDGAR filings, proxy statements, management structures, cost savings from redundant operations, strategic reasons for the merger, regulatory issues, press releases, and competitive position of the combined company within the industries it competes. Merger arbitrageurs will calculate the rate of return that is implicit in the current spread and compare it to the event risk associated with the deal. If the spread is sufficient to compensate for the expected event risk, they will execute the arbitrage.

Once again, the term "arbitrage" is used loosely. As discussed above, there is plenty of event risk associated with a merger announcement. The profits earned from merger arbitrage are not riskless. As an example, consider the announced deal between Tellabs and Ciena in 1998.

Ciena owned technology that allowed fiber optic telephone lines to carry more information. The technology allowed telephone carriers to get more bandwidth out of existing fiber optic lines. Tellabs made digital connecting systems. These systems allowed carriers to connect incoming and outgoing telephonic lines as well as allow many signals to travel over one phone circuit.

Tellabs and Ciena announced their intent to merge on June 3, 1998 in a one for one stock swap. One share of Tellabs would be issued for each share of Ciena. The purpose of the merger was to position the two companies to compete with larger entities such as Lucent Technologies. Additionally, each company expected to leverage their business off of the other's customer base. Tellabs price at the time was about  $66 while that of Ciena's was at$ 57.

Shortly after the announcement, the share price of Tellabs declined to about 64 while that of Ciena's increased to about 60. Still, there was 4 of merger premium to extract from the market if the deal were completed. A merger arbitrage hedge fund manager would employ the following strategy:

Short 1000 shares of Tellabs at $64

Purchase 1000 shares of Ciena at $60

Unfortunately, the deal did not go according to plan. During the summer, Ciena lost two large customers, and it issued a warning that its third quarter profits would decline. Ciena's stock price plummeted to $15 by September. In mid-September the deal fell apart. The shares of Ciena were trading at such a discount to Tellabs' share price that it did not make economic sense to complete the merger, when Ciena's shares could be purchased cheaply on the open market. In addition, Tellabs share price declined to about $42 on earnings concerns.

By the time the merger deal fell through, the hedge fund manager would have to close out his positions:

Buy 1000 shares of Tellabs stock at $42

Sell 1000 shares of Ciena at $15

The total return for the hedge fund manager would be:

Gain on Tellabs shares: 1000 × ($64 - $42) = $22,000

Loss of Ciena shares:  $1000 \times ($ 15 - $60) = -$45,000

Short rebate on Tellabs:  $4.5\% \times 1000 \times \$ 64 \times (110 / 360) = \ $880$

Total:  $= -\$  22,120$

For a total return on invested capital of:

$$
- \$ 22,120 \div \$ 60,000 = -36.87 \%
$$

Further, suppose the hedge fund manager had used leverage to initiate this strategy, borrowing one half of the invested capital from his prime broker for the initial purchase of the Ciena shares. The total return would then be:

Gain on Tellabs shares:  $1000 \times ($ 64 - $42) = $22,000

Loss of Ciena shares:  $1000 \times ($ 15 - $60) = -$45,000

Short rebate on Tellabs:  $4.5\% \times 1000 \times \$ 64 \times (110 / 360) = \ $880$

Financing cost:  $6\% \times 500 \times \$ 60 \times (110 / 360)\quad = \quad -\ $550$

Total: = -\ 22,670

The return on invested capital is now:

$$
- \$ 22,670 \div \$ 30,000 = -75.57 \%
$$

On an annualized basis, this is a return of  $-247\%$ . This example of a failed merger demonstrates the event risk associated with merger arbitrage. When deals fall through, it gets ugly. Furthermore, the event risk is exacerbated by the amount of leverage applied in the strategy. It is estimated that Long Term Capital Management of Greenwich, Connecticut had a 4 million share position in the Tellabs-Ciena merger deal, much of it supported by leverage.

Some merger arbitrage managers only invest in announced deals. However, other hedge fund managers will invest on the basis of rumor or speculation. The deal risk is much greater with this type of strategy, but so too is the merger spread (the premium that can be captured).

EXHIBIT 25.7 HFRI Merger Arbitrage Index

To control for risk, most merger arbitrage hedge fund managers have some risk of loss limit at which they will exit positions. Some hedge fund managers concentrate only in one or two industries, applying their specialized knowledge regarding an economic sector to their advantage. Other merger arbitrage managers maintain a diversified portfolio across several industries to spread out the event risk.

Like fixed income arbitrage, merger arbitrage is deal driven rather than market driven. Merger arbitrage derives its return from the relative value of the stock prices between two companies as opposed to the status of the current market conditions. Consequently, merger arbitrage returns should not be highly correlated with the general stock market. Exhibit 25.7 highlights this point. Similar to fixed income arbitrage, merger arbitrage earns steady returns year after year.

# Relative Value Arbitrage

Relative value arbitrage might be better named the smorgasbord of arbitrage. This is because relative value hedge fund managers are catholic in their investment strategies; they invest across the universe of arbitrage strategies. The best known of these managers was Long Term Capital Management (LTCM). Once the story of LTCM unfolded, it was clear that their trading strategies involved merger arbitrage, fixed income arbitrage, volatility arbitrage, stub trading, and convertible arbitrage.

In general, the strategy of relative value managers is to invest in spread trades: the simultaneous purchase of one security and the sale of another when the economic relationship between the two securities (the "spread") has become mispriced. The mispricing may be based on historical averages or mathematical equations. In either case, the relative value arbitrage manager purchases the security that is "cheap" and sells the security that is "rich." It is called relative value arbitrage because the cheapness or richness of a security is determined relative to a second security. Consequently, relative value managers do not take directional bets on the financial markets. Instead, they take focused bets on the pricing relationship between two securities regardless of the current market conditions.

Relative value managers attempt to remove the influence of the financial markets from their investment strategies. This is made easy by the fact that they simultaneously buy and sell similar securities. Therefore, the market risk embedded in each security should cancel out. Any residual risk can be neutralized through the use of options or futures. What is left is pure security selection: the purchase of those securities that are cheap and the sale of those securities that are rich. Relative value managers earn a profit when the spread between the two securities returns to normal. They then unwind their positions and collect their profit.

We have already discussed merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, and fixed income arbitrage. Two other popular forms of relative value arbitrage are stub trading and volatility arbitrage.

Stub trading is an equity-based strategy. Frequently, companies acquire a majority stake in another company, but their stock price does not fully reflect their interest in the acquired company. As an example, consider Company A whose stock is trading at  $50. Company A owns a majority stake in Company B, whose remaining outstanding stock, or stub, is trading at$ 40. The value of Company A should be the combination of its own operations, estimated at  $45 a share, plus its majority stake in Company B's operations, estimated at$ 8 a share. Therefore, Company A's share price is undervalued relative to the value that Company B should contribute to Company A's share price. The share price of Company A should be about $53, but instead, it is trading at $50. The investment strategy would be to purchase Company A's stock and sell the appropriate ratio of Company B's stock.

Let's assume that Company A's ownership in Company B contributes to  $20\%$  of Company A's overall revenues. Therefore, the operations of Company B should contribute one fifth to Company A's share price. Therefore, a proper hedging ratio would be four shares of Company A's stock to Company B's stock.

The arbitrage strategy is:

Buy four shares of Company A stock at 4 \times \50 = \200$

Sell one share of Company B stock at  $1 \times \$ 40 = \$ 40$

The relative value manager is now long Company A stock and hedged against the fluctuation of Company B's stock. Let's assume that over three months the share price of Company B increases to $42 a share, the value of Company A's operations remains constant at $45, but now the shares of Company A correctly reflect the contribution of Company B's operations. The value of the position will be:

Value of Company A's operations:  $4 \times \$  45 = \$ 180$

Value of Company B's operations:  $4 \times \$  42 \times 20\% = \$ 33.6$

Loss on short of Company B stock:  $1 \times ($ 40 - $42) = -$2

Short rebate on Company B stock:  $1 \times \$ 40 \times 4.5\% \times 3/12 = \ $0.45$

Total: = $212.05

The initial invested capital was  $200 for a gain of$ 12.05, or 6.02\% over three months. Suppose the stock of Company B had declined to $30, but Company B's operations were properly valued in Company A's share price. The position value would be:

Value of Company A's operations:  $4 \times \$  45 = \$ 180$

Value of Company B's operations:  $4 \times \$ 30 \times 20\% = \$24$

Gain on short of Company B's stock: 1 × ($40 - $30) = $10

Short rebate on Company B's stock:  $1 \times \$ 40 \times 4.5\% \times 3/12 = \ $0.045$

Total: = $214.45

The initial invested capital was  $200 for a gain of$ 14.45, or 7.22\% over three months. For stub trading to work there must be some market catalyst such that the contribution of Company B is properly reflected in Company A's share price.

Volatility arbitrage involves options and warrant trading. Option prices contain an implied number for volatility. That is, it is possible to observe the market price of an option and back out the value of volatility implied in the current price using various option pricing models. The arbitrageur can then compare options on the same underlying stock to determine if the volatility implied by their prices are the same.

The implied volatility derived from option pricing models should represent the expected volatility of the underlying stock that will be realized over the life of the option. Therefore, two options on the same underlying stock should have the same implied volatility. If they do not, an arbitrage opportunity may be available. Additionally, if the implied volatility is significantly different from the historical volatility of the underlying stock, then relative value arbitrageurs expect the implied volatility will revert back to its historical average. This allows hedge fund managers to determine which options are priced "cheap" versus "rich." Once again, relative value managers sell those options that are rich based on the implied volatility relative to the historical volatility and buy those options with cheap volatility relative to historical volatility.

Exhibit 25.8 presents the value of relative value arbitrage compared to the S&P 500. This strategy demonstrates steady returns without much influence from the direction of the stock market.

# Event-Driven

Event-driven hedge funds attempt to capture mispricing associated with capital market transactions. These transactions include mergers and acquisitions, spin-offs, tracking stocks, reorganizations, bankruptcies, share buy-backs, special dividends, and any other significant market event.

By their nature, these special events are nonrecurring. Consequently, the market may take time to digest the information associated with these transactions, providing an opportunity for event-driven managers to act quickly and capture a premium in the market. Additionally, some of these events may be subject to certain conditions such as shareholder or regulatory approval. Therefore, there is event risk associated with this strategy. The profitability of this type of strategy is dependent upon the successful completion of the transaction within the expected time frame.

We should not expect event-driven strategies to be influenced by the general stock market, since these are company specific events, not market driven events. However, in Exhibit 25.9 we do see that the value of event-driven strategies does closely parallel that value of the S&P 500. This could be because the strong stock market of 1990s encouraged more capital market transactions.

EXHIBIT 25.9 HFRI Event-Driven Index

# Market Neutral

Our last two categories are different from the previous hedge fund strategies in that they employ little or no leverage and maintain little or no market exposure. In fact, the very nature of their programs is to limit or eliminate market exposure altogether. We start with market neutral hedge funds.

Market neutral hedge funds also go long and short the market. The difference is that they maintain integrated portfolios which are designed to neutralize market risk. This means being neutral to the general stock market as well as having neutral risk exposures across industries. Security selection is all that matters.

Market neutral hedge fund managers generally apply the rule of one alpha. $^{6}$  This means that they build an integrated portfolio designed to produce only one source of alpha. This is distinct from equity long/short managers who build two separate portfolios: one long and one short, with two sources of alpha. The idea of integrated portfolio construction is to neutralize market and industry risk and concentrate purely on stock selection. In other words, there is no "beta" risk in the portfolio either with respect to the broad stock market or with respect to any industry. Only stock selection, or alpha, should remain.

Market neutral hedge fund managers generally hold equal positions of long and short stock positions. Therefore, the manager is dollar neutral; there is no net exposure to the market either on the long side or on the short side.

Market neutral investors generally apply no leverage because there is no market exposure to leverage. However, some leverage is always inherent when stocks are borrowed and shorted. Nonetheless, the nature of this strategy is that it has minimal credit risk.

Generally, market neutral managers follow a three-step procedure in their strategy. The first step is to build an initial screen of "investable" stocks. These are stocks traded on the manager's local exchange, with sufficient liquidity so as to be able to enter and exit positions quickly, and with sufficient float so that the stock may be borrowed from the hedge fund manager's prime broker for short positions. Additionally, the hedge fund manager may limit his universe to a capitalization segment of the equity universe such as the mid-cap range.

Second, the hedge fund manager typically builds factor models. These are linear and quadratic regression equations designed to identify those economic factors that consistently have an impact on share prices. This process is very similar to that discussed with respect to equity long/short hedge fund manages. Indeed, the two strategies are very similar in their portfolio construction methods. The difference is that equity long/short managers tend to have a net long exposure to the market while market neutral managers have no exposure.

Factor models are used for stock selection. These models are often known as "alpha engines." Their purpose is to find those financial variables that influence stock prices. These are bottom-up models that concentrate solely on corporate financial information as opposed to macroeconomic data. This is the source of the manager's skill—his stock selection ability.

The last step is portfolio construction. The hedge fund manager will use a computer program to construct his portfolio in such a way that it is neutral to the market as well as across industries. The hedge fund manager may use a commercial "optimizer"—computer software designed to measure exposure to the market and produce a trade list for execution based on a manager's desired exposure to the market—or he may use his own computer algorithms to measure and neutralize risk.

Most market neutral managers use optimizers to neutralize market and industry exposure. However, more sophisticated optimizers attempt to keep the portfolio neutral to several risk factors. These include size, book to value, price/earnings ratios, and market price to book value ratios. The idea is to have no intended or unintended risk exposures that might compromise the portfolio's neutrality.

Market neutral programs tend to be labeled "black boxes." This is a term for sophisticated computer algorithms that lack transparency. The lack of transparency associated with these investment strategies comes in two forms. First, hedge fund managers, by nature, are secretive. They are reluctant to reveal their proprietary trading programs. Second, even if a hedge fund manager were to reveal his proprietary computer algorithms, these algorithms are often so sophisticated and complicated that they are difficult to comprehend.

We would expect market neutral hedge fund managers to produce returns independent of the stock market (they are neutral to the stock market). Exhibit 25.10 confirms this expectation.

# Market Timers

Market timers, as their name suggests, attempt to time the most propitious moments to be in the market, and invest in cash otherwise. More specifically, they attempt to time the market so that they are fully invested during bull markets, and strictly in cash during bear markets.

Unlike equity long/short strategies or market neutral strategies, market times use a top-down approach as opposed to a bottom-up approach. Market timing hedge fund managers are not stock pickers. They analyze fiscal and monetary policy as well as key macroeconomic indicators to determine whether the economy is gathering or running out of steam.

Macroeconomic variables they may analyze are labor productivity, business investment, purchasing managers' surveys, commodity prices, consumer confidence, housing starts, retail sales, industrial production, balance of payments, current account deficits/surpluses, and durable good orders.

They use this macroeconomic data to forecast the expected gross domestic product (GDP) for the next quarter. Forecasting models typically are based on multifactor linear regressions, taking into account whether a variable is a leading or lagging indicator and whether the variable experiences any seasonal effects.

EXHIBIT 25.11 HFRI Market Timing Index

Once market timers have their forecast for the next quarter(s) they position their investment portfolio in the market according to their forecast. Construction of their portfolio is quite simple. They do not need to purchase individual stocks. Instead, they buy or sell stock index futures and options to increase or decrease their exposure to the market as necessary. At all times, contributed capital from investors is kept in short-term, risk-free, interest bearing accounts. Treasury bills are often purchased which not only yield a current risk-free interest rate, but also can be used as margin for the purchase of stock index futures.

When a market timer's forecast is bullish, he may purchase stock index futures with an economic exposure equivalent to the contributed capital. He may apply leverage by purchasing futures contracts that provide an economic exposure to the stock market greater than that of the underlying capital. However, market timers tend to use limited amounts of leverage.

When the hedge fund manager is bearish, he will trim his market exposure by selling futures contracts. If he is completely bearish, he will sell all of his stock index futures and call options and just sit on his cash portfolio. Some market timers may be more aggressive and short stock index futures and buy stock index put options to take advantage of bear markets. In general though, market timers have either long exposure to the market or no exposure. Consequently, this is a conservative hedge fund strategy in the same mode as market neutral programs. Exhibit 25.11 confirms this analysis.

# SHOULD HEDGE FUNDS BE PART OF AN INVESTMENT PROGRAM?

A considerable amount of research has been dedicated to examining the return potential of several hedge fund styles. Additionally, a number of studies have considered hedge funds within a portfolio context, i.e., hedge funds blended with other asset classes.

The body of research on hedge funds demonstrates two key qualifications for hedge funds. First, that over the time period of 1989-2000, the returns to hedge funds were positive. The highest returns were achieved by global macro hedge funds, and the lowest returns were achieved by short selling hedge funds. Not all categories of hedge funds beat the S&P 500. However, in many cases, the volatility associated with hedge fund returns was lower than that of the S&P 500, resulting in higher Sharpe Ratios.

Second, the empirical research demonstrates that hedge funds provide good diversification benefits. In other words, hedge funds do, in fact, hedge other financial assets. Correlation coefficients with the S&P 500 range from  $-0.7$  for short selling hedge funds to 0.83 for opportunistic hedge funds investing in the U.S. markets. The less than perfect positive correlation with financial assets indicates that hedge funds can expand the efficient frontier for asset managers.

In summary, the recent research on hedge funds indicates consistent, positive performance with low correlation with traditional asset classes. The conclusion is that hedge funds can expand the investment opportunity set for investors, offering both return enhancement as well as diversification benefits.

# IS HEDGE FUND PERFORMANCE PERSISTENT?

This is the age-old question with respect to all asset managers, not just hedge funds: Can the manager repeat her good performance? This issue, though, is particularly acute for the hedge fund marketplace for two reasons. First, hedge fund managers often claim that the source of their returns is "skill-based" rather than dependent upon general financial market conditions. Second, hedge fund managers tend to have shorter track records than traditional money managers.

Unfortunately, the evidence regarding hedge fund performance persistence is mixed. The few empirical studies that have addressed this issue have provided inconclusive evidence whether hedge fund managers can produce enduring results. Part of the reason for the mixed results is the short track records of most hedge fund managers. A 3-year or 5-year track record is too short a period of time to be able to estimate an accurate expected return or risk associated with that manager.

In addition, the skill-based claim of hedge fund managers makes it more difficult to assess their performance relative to a benchmark. Without a benchmark index for comparison, it is difficult to determine whether a hedge fund manager has outperformed or underperformed her performance "bogiey." As a result, the persistence of hedge fund manager performance will remain an open issue until manager databases with longer performance track records can be developed.

# A HEDGE FUND INVESTMENT STRATEGY

The above discussion demonstrates that hedge funds can expand the investment opportunity set for investors. The question now becomes: What is to be accomplished by the hedge fund investment program? The strategy may be simply a search for an additional source of return. Conversely, it may be for risk management purposes. Whatever its purpose, an investment plan for hedge funds may consider one of four strategies. Hedge funds may be selected on an opportunistic basis, as a hedge fund of funds, as part of a joint venture, or as an absolute return strategy.

# Opportunistic Hedge Fund Investing

The term "hedge fund" can be misleading. Hedge funds do not necessarily have to hedge an investment portfolio. Rather, they can be used to expand the investment opportunity set. This is the opportunistic nature of hedge funds—they can provide an investor with new investment opportunities that she cannot otherwise obtain through traditional long only investments.

There are several ways hedge funds can be opportunistic. First, many hedge fund managers can add value to an existing investment portfolio through specialization in a sector or in a market strategy. These managers do not contribute portable alpha. Instead, they contribute above market returns through the application of superior skill or knowledge to a narrow market or strategy.

Consider a portfolio manager whose particular expertise is the biotechnology industry. She has followed this industry for years and has developed a superior information set to identify winners and losers. On the long only side the manager purchases those stocks that she believes will increase in value, and avoids those biotech stocks she believes will decline in value. However, this strategy does not utilize her superior information set to its fullest advantage. The ability to go both long and short biotech stocks in a hedge fund is the only way to maximize the value of the manager's information set. Therefore, a biotech hedge fund provides a new opportunity: the ability to extract value on both the long side and the short side of the biotech market.

The goal of this strategy is to identify the best managers in a specific economic sector or specific market segment that complements the existing investment portfolio. These managers are used to enhance the risk and return profile of an existing portfolio, rather than hedge it.

Opportunistic hedge funds tend to have a benchmark. Take the example of the biotech long/short hedge fund. An appropriate benchmark would be the AMEX Biotech Index that contains 17 biotechnology companies. Alternatively, if the investor believed that the biotech sector will outperform the general stock market, she could use a broad based stock index such as the S&P 500 for the benchmark. The point is that opportunistic hedge funds are not absolute return vehicles (discussed below). Their performance can be measured relative to a benchmark.

As another example, most institutional investors have a broad equity portfolio. This portfolio may include an index fund, external value and growth managers, and possibly, private equity investments. However, along the spectrum of this equity portfolio, there may be gaps in its investment line-up. For instance, many hedge funds combine late stage private investments with public securities. These hybrid funds are a natural extension of an institution's investment portfolio because they bridge the gap between private equity and index funds. Therefore a new opportunity is identified: the ability to blend private equity and public securities within one investment strategy. We will discuss this strategy further in our section on private equity.

Again, we come back to one of our main themes: that alternative "assets" are really alternative investment strategies, and these alternative strategies are used to expand the investment opportunity set rather than hedge it. In summary, hedge funds may be selected not necessarily to reduce the risk of an existing investment portfolio, but instead, to complement its risk and return profile. Opportunistic investing is designed to select hedge fund managers that can enhance certain portions of a broader portfolio.

Another way to consider opportunistic hedge fund investments is that they are finished products because their investment strategy or market segment complements an institutional investor's existing asset allocation. In other words, these hybrid funds can plug the gaps of an existing portfolio. No further work is necessary on the part of the institution because the investment opportunity set has been expanded by the addition of the hybrid product. These "gaps" may be in domestic equity, fixed income, or international investments. Additionally, because opportunistic hedge funds are finished products, it makes it easier to establish performance benchmarks.

Constructing an opportunistic portfolio of hedge funds will depend upon the constraints under which such a program operates. For example, if an investor's hedge fund program is not limited in scope or style, then diversification across a broad range of hedge fund styles would be appropriate. If, however, the hedge fund program is limited in scope to, for instance, expanding the equity investment opportunity set, the choices will be less diversified across strategies. Exhibit 25.12 demonstrates these two choices.

# Hedge Fund of Funds

A hedge fund of funds is an investment in a group of hedge funds, from five to more than 20. The purpose of a hedge fund of funds is to reduce the idiosyncratic risk of any one hedge fund manager. In other words, there is safety in numbers. This is simply modern portfolio theory (MPT) applied to the hedge fund marketplace. Diversification is one of the founding principles of MPT, and it is as applicable to hedge funds as it is to stocks and bonds.

# Joint Venture

As noted in the introduction, the hedge fund market is fragmented with most hedge fund managers controlling a relatively small amount of assets. This provides a good opportunity to enter into a joint venture with an emerging hedge fund manager.

The greatest challenge for any new hedge fund manager is attracting sufficient capital to achieve a critical mass. Park, Brown, and Goetzmann find the attrition rate for hedge funds is about  $15\%$  per year, while Brown, Goetzmann, and Ibbotson find that few hedge funds survive more than three years.[7] A large institutional investor can provide the necessary capital along with the stability and the credibility necessary to achieve this critical mass. In such a situation a hedge fund manager receives a much greater benefit than just the fees collected.

In return for these start-up benefits, the institution can ask for reduced fees and a potential equity stake in the manager's revenues. As the hedge fund manager increases its assets under management, the institution will share in this growth. Additionally, the institution can earn excellent returns from its hedge fund investment with a lower fee structure. This form of collaboration can produce good long-term returns for both the institutional investor and the hedge fund manager.

Another new development in the hedge fund marketplace is the hedge fund management company. These are asset management companies that build a stable of hedge fund managers by acquiring equity ownership in the hedge fund manager. This business model is similar to that for mutual fund companies established by traditional money managers.

In the mutual fund industry, a corporation is established that advises each individual mutual fund. The investment adviser registers the mutual fund company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, sells shares of the mutual fund to investors, and performs all of the necessary accounting and operational duties. The fees earned from providing investment advice to the mutual fund flow upward to the advisory company.

Similarly, hedge fund management companies take care of all of the regulatory, operational, and marketing issues for the hedge fund manager, and in return, receive an equity stake in the management and profit sharing fees earned by the hedge fund manager. These hedge fund management companies need investment capital for two reasons.

First, they need working capital to acquire hedge fund managers for their management company. Second, they need investment capital to place with their hedge fund managers. In return, an investor can receive an equity stake in the hedge fund management company, or the individual hedge fund manager and receive the benefit of a hedge fund investment.

This strategy is a combination of private equity and hedge fund investing, and it offers several advantages. First many institutional investors maintain a private equity staff. Using this staff to enter into another arena in the alternative asset world allows an institution to apply its investment experience in a new venue. This "portable expertise" is analogous to portable alpha in that it can be added to other avenues of the alternative asset market.

Second, private equity investments tend to be structured as funds or pools. This legal structure is similar (but not identical) to that for hedge funds. Consequently, private equity investors tend to have considerable experience sorting through the issues of pooled investors in an alternative asset vehicle.

Lastly, the linking of private equity and hedge fund investing is a natural evolution in alternative asset investing. The expansion of the investment opportunity set need not be done through the selection of discrete pockets of alternative assets; combinations of alternative assets will work just as well.

# Absolute Return

Hedge funds are often described as "absolute return" products. This term comes from the skill-based nature of the industry. Hedge fund managers generally claim that their investment returns are derived from their skill at security selection rather than that of broad asset classes. This is due to the fact that most hedge fund managers build concentrated portfolios of relatively few investment positions and do not attempt to track a stock or bond index. The work of Fung and Hsieh shows that hedge funds generate a return distribution that is very different from mutual funds.[9]

Further, given the generally unregulated waters in which hedge fund managers operate, they have greater flexibility in their trading style and execution than traditional long-only managers. This flexibility provides a greater probability that a hedge fund manager will reach his return targets. As a result, hedge funds have often been described as absolute return vehicles that target a specific annual return regardless of what performance might be found among market indices. In other words, hedge fund managers target an absolute return rather than determine their performance relative to an index.

All traditional long-only managers are benchmarked to some passive index. The nature of benchmarking is such that it forces the manager to focus on his benchmark and his tracking error associated with that benchmark. This focus on benchmarking leads traditional active managers to commit a large portion their portfolios to tracking their benchmark. The necessity to consider the impact of every trade on the portfolio's tracking error relative to its assigned benchmark reduces the flexibility of the investment manager.

In addition, long-only active managers are constrained in their ability to short securities. They may only "go short" a security up to its weight in the benchmark index. If the security is only a small part of the index, the manager's efforts to short the stock will be further constrained. The inability to short a security beyond its benchmark weight deprives an active manager of a significant amount of the mispricing in the marketplace. Furthermore, not only are long-only managers unable to take advantage of overpriced securities, but they also cannot fully take advantage of underpriced securities because they cannot generate the necessary short positions to balance the overweights with respect to underpriced securities.

The flexibility of hedge fund managers allows them to go both long and short without benchmark constraints. This allows them to set a target rate of return or an "absolute return."

Specific parameters must be set for an absolute return program. These parameters will direct how the hedge fund program is constructed and operated and should include risk and return targets as well as the type of hedge fund strategies that may be selected. Absolute return parameters should operate at two levels: that of the individual hedge fund manager and for the overall hedge fund program. The investor sets target return ranges for each hedge fund manager but sets a specific target return level for the absolute return program. The parameters for the individual managers may be different than that for the program. For example, acceptable levels of volatility for individual hedge fund managers may be greater than that for the program.

The program parameters for the hedge fund managers may be based on such factors as volatility, expected return, types of instruments traded, leverage, and historical drawdown. Other qualitative factors may be included such as length of track record, periodic liquidity, minimum investment, and assets under management. Liquidity is particularly important because an investor needs to know with certainty her timeframe for cashing out of an absolute return program if hedge fund returns turn sour.

EXHIBIT 25.13 An Absolute Return Strategy

<table><tr><td>Absolute Return Portfolio</td><td>Individual Hedge Fund Managers</td></tr><tr><td>Target Return: 15\%</td><td>Expected Return: 10\% to 25\%</td></tr><tr><td>Target Risk: 7\%</td><td>Target Risk: 5\% to 15\%</td></tr><tr><td>Largest Acceptable Drawdown: 10\%</td><td>Largest Drawdown: 10\% to 20\%</td></tr><tr><td>Liquidity: Semiannual</td><td>Liquidity: Semiannual</td></tr><tr><td>Hedge Fund Style: Equity-based</td><td>Hedge Fund Style: Equity L/S, Market Neutral, Merger Arbitrage, Short Selling, Event-Driven, Convertible Arbitrage</td></tr><tr><td>Length of Track Record: 3 years</td><td>Minimum Track Record: 3 years</td></tr></table>

Exhibit 25.13 demonstrates an absolute return program strategy. Notice that the return for the portfolio has a specific target rate of  $15\%$ , while for the individual hedge funds, the return range is  $10\%$  to  $25\%$ . Also, the absolute return portfolio has a target level for risk and drawdowns, while for the individual hedge funds, a range is acceptable.

However, certain parameters are synchronized. Liquidity, for instance, must be the same for both the absolute return portfolio and that of the individual hedge fund managers. The reason is that a range of liquidity is not acceptable if the investor wishes to liquidate her portfolio. She must be able to cash out of each hedge fund within the same timeframe as that established for the portfolio.

# SELECTING A HEDGE FUND MANAGER

A considerable amount of research has been dedicated to determining the economic value added of hedge funds. Yet, despite the mounting evidence regarding the value of hedge funds, very little has been written regarding the selection of hedge fund managers. In this chapter we address some practical issues to consider in establishing a hedge fund investment program.

# A Graphical Presentation of the Hedge Fund Industry

It should be no surprise to most investors that hedge funds operate differently from traditional long-only investment managers. Long-only managers typically invest in either the equity or bond market, but do not leverage their investment bets. Therefore, their investment programs have considerable market risk exposure, but very little leverage or credit risk exposure.[10]

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/34152bb9-0c82-464c-8d95-33ab992e7f99/0bc8b655d111e93faa0f09a41e6cb00411aeaceb6e2e6f18871f3610d9a46a14.jpg)

EXHIBIT 25.14 Long-Only Investments

Consider Exhibit 25.14. This exhibit plots market risk versus credit risk for several styles of long-only managers. We use a relative scale of 0 to 5 where 0 represents no exposure to financial market risk and 5 represents the maximum exposure. The same relative scale is applied with respect to credit risk.

As Exhibit 25.14 demonstrates, traditional long-only managers have considerable exposure to market risk but minimal exposure to credit risk. At one end of the scale are money market cash managers. To avoid "breaking the buck" these managers do not take any credit risk or market risk. They invest in the most liquid and creditworthy of short-term financial paper. Typically, this includes high-grade 90-day commercial paper and 90-day U.S. Treasury obligations.

At the other end of the scale are private equity managers. They take no credit risk, but have the greatest exposure to market risk. Most private equity funds, for instance, have lock-up periods between 7 and 10 years. Investments made by private equity funds are in non-public securities for which no readily available market exists. Liquidity is low, and investors are exposed to the long-term prospects of the equity market.

In between the cash managers and the private equity managers, and along the increasing scale of market risk, we find fixed-income managers, value managers, equity index managers, and growth managers.

The graphical analysis changes considerably for hedge fund managers. Exhibit 25.15 demonstrates the market versus credit risk exposures for several major styles of hedge funds. Near the zero axis we find mar ket neutral funds—those hedge funds with no market exposure (market neutral) and low leverage. Market neutral funds use limited amounts of leverage because there is no market exposure to leverage or magnify.

Along the credit risk axis, we see that the exposure to credit risk increases for merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, and fixed-income arbitrage. The use of leverage, or credit risk, is a major factor that distinguishes hedge fund managers from traditional long-only managers.

Merger arbitrage, for example, usually applies low leverage, in the range of 2:1. Recall that merger arbitrage involves buying the equity securities of the target company and selling the equity securities of the acquiring company. Although the terms of the merger are announced for all to see, the companies may sell at a discount to the announced price to reflect the uncertainty associated with the completion of the merger. Despite the offsetting positions, there may still be some residual market risk because the two merger partners are corporations whose fortunes depend somewhat on the general market conditions.

Other arbitrage hedge funds, such as convertible arbitrage, have a small market exposure but a large credit exposure. This is because arbitrage funds take small market bets but use leverage (sometimes, considerable amounts) to magnify the size of the market bets.

These types of hedge funds extract their profits from relative value trades. They trade based on relatively small price discrepancies in the market, but use large amounts of leverage to extract the most value from these small discrepancies.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/34152bb9-0c82-464c-8d95-33ab992e7f99/1982807732ee5320882c96ccf5aba370efccac0f16118f9196c4b5dc6bf3cf7e.jpg)

EXHIBIT 25.15 Hedge Funds

Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) of Greenwich, Connecticut was the best-known example of these relative value/arbitrage players. It has been well documented that LTCM used massive amounts of leverage to extract value from its relatively small market bets.[11] Consequently, we use it to define the upper boundary for credit exposure.

Equity long/short and global macro hedge funds have exposure to both credit risk and market risk. Global macro funds tend to make large bets on the direction of certain currencies, commodities, stock markets, or bond markets. Generally, global macro funds have the ability to invest across the investment spectrum and national borders in the placing of their bets. Consequently, they have a large market exposure. Global macro funds may also use leverage to magnify the size of their bets. George Soros and Julian Robertson were the best known of the macro hedge fund managers.

Long/short equity hedge funds, by their very nature, are exposed to the stock market. Also, this type of hedge fund manager sometimes uses leverage to increase the value of long/short positions.

The main point of Exhibits 25.14 and 25.15 is that hedge fund managers have risk profiles that differ considerably from that of traditional long-only investments. In particular, hedge funds often take considerable credit risk in their investment strategies.

# Three Fundamental Questions

The hedge fund industry is still relatively new because it has attracted attention only within the past decade. In fact, most of the academic research on hedge funds was conducted during the 1990s. As a result, for most hedge fund managers, a twoto three-year track record is considered long term. In fact, Park, Brown, and Goetzmann find that the attrition rate in the hedge fund industry is about  $15\%$  per year and that the half-life for hedge funds is about 2.5 years. Liang documents an attrition rate of  $8.54\%$  per year for hedge funds. Weisman indicates that relying on a hedge fund manager's past performance history can lead to disappointing investment results.[12] Consequently, performance history, while useful, cannot be relied upon solely in selecting a hedge fund manager.

Beyond performance numbers, there are three fundamental questions that every hedge fund manager should answer during the initial screening process. The answers to these three questions are critical to understanding the nature of the hedge fund manager's investment program. The three questions are:

1. What is the investment objective of the hedge fund?
2. What is the investment process of the hedge fund manager?
3. What makes the hedge fund manager so smart?

A hedge fund manager should have a clear and concise statement of its investment objective. Second, the hedge fund manager should identify its investment process. For instance, is it quantitatively or qualitatively based? Last, the hedge fund manager must demonstrate that he or she is smarter than other money managers.

The questions presented in this chapter are threshold issues. These questions are screening tools designed to reduce an initial universe of hedge fund managers down to a select pool of potential investments. They are not, however, a substitute for a thorough due diligence review. We address that subject later in this chapter. Instead, these questions can identify potential hedge fund candidates for which due diligence is appropriate.

# Investment Objective

The question of a hedge fund manager's investment objective can be broken down into three questions:

1. In which markets does the hedge fund manager invest?
2. What is the hedge fund manager's general investment strategy?
3. What is the hedge fund manager's benchmark, if any?

Although these questions may seem straightforward, they are often surprisingly difficult to answer. Consider the following language from a hedge fund disclosure document:

The principal objective of the Fund is capital appreciation, primarily through the purchase and sale of securities, commodities and other financial instruments including without limitation, stocks, bonds, notes, debentures, and bills issued by corporations, municipalities, sovereign nations or other entities; options, rights, warrants, convertible securities, exchangeable securities, synthetic and/or structured convertible or exchangeable products, participation interests, investment contracts, mortgages, mort gage and asset-backed securities, real estate and interests therein; currencies, other futures, commodity options, forward contracts, money market instruments, bank notes, bank guarantees, letters of credit, other forms of bank obligations; other swaps and other derivative instruments; limited partnership interests and other limited partnership securities or instruments; and contracts relating to the foregoing; in each case whether now existing or created in the future.

Let's analyze the above statement in light of our three investment objective questions.

Question 1: In which markets does the hedge fund manager invest?

Answer: In every market known to exist.

By listing every possible financial, commodity, or investment contract currently in existence (or to exist in the future), the hedge fund manager has covered all options, but has left the investor uniformed. Unfortunately, the unlimited nature of the hedge fund manager's potential investment universe does not help to narrow the scope of the manager's investment objective.

Question 2: What is the hedge fund manager's general strategy?

Answer: Capital appreciation.

This answer too, is uninformative. Rarely does any investor invest in a hedge fund for capital depreciation. Generally, hedge funds are not used as tax shelters. Furthermore, many institutional investors are tax-exempt so that taxes are not a consideration. Capital appreciation is assumed for most investments, including hedge funds. The above language is far too general to be informative.

Question 3: What is the manager's benchmark, if any?

Answer: There is no effective benchmark. The manager's investment universe is so widespread as to make any benchmark useless.

Unfortunately, the above disclosure language, while very detailed, discloses very little. It does cover all of the manager's legal bases, but it does not inform the investor.

Where does this manager fall within the hedge fund spectrum in Exhibit 25.15? The very broad nature of this hedge fund's investment objective places it in the global macro category. Its investment universe is far too broad to be an arbitrage fund. By the same token, its strategy is too expansive to be considered an equity long/short program. Its only appropriate category is global macro.

By contrast, consider the following language from a second hedge fund disclosure document.

The Fund's investment objective is to make investments in public securities that generate a long-term return in excess of that generated by the overall U.S. public equity market while reducing the market risk of the portfolio through selective short positions.

This one sentence answers all three investment objective questions. First, the manager identifies that it invests in the U.S. public equity market. Second, the manager discloses that it uses a long/short investment strategy. Lastly, the manager states that its objective is to outperform the overall U.S. equity market. Therefore, a suitable benchmark might be the S&P500, the Russell 1000, or a sector index.

From Exhibit 25.15, this hedge fund is clearly identified as an equity long/short strategy. Its primary purpose is to take on market risk, not credit risk.

In summary, long-winded disclosure statements are not necessary. A well-thought-out investment strategy can be summarized in one sentence.

# Investment Process

Most investors prefer a well-defined investment process that describes how an investment manager makes its investments. The articulation and documentation of the process can be just as important as the investment results generated by the process. Consider the following language from another hedge fund disclosure document:

The manager makes extensive use of computer technology in both the formulation and execution of many investment decisions. Buy and sell decisions will, in many cases, be made and executed algorithmically according to quantitative trading strategies embodied in analytical computer software running the manager's computer facilities or on other computers used to support the Fund's trading activities.

This is a "black box." A black box is the algorithmic extension of the hedge fund manager's brain power. Computer algorithms are developed to quantify the manager's skill or investment insight.

For black box managers, the black box itself is the investment process. It is not that the black boxes are bad investments. In fact, the hedge fund research indicates that proprietary quantitative trading strategies can be quite successful. $^{13}$  Rather, the issue is whether good performance results justify the lack of a clear investment process.

Black box programs tend to be used in arbitrage or relative value hedge fund programs. From Exhibit 25.15 we can see that these types of programs fall along the credit risk axis. Hedge fund managers use quantitative computer algorithms to seek out pricing discrepancies between similar securities or investment contracts. They then sell the investment that appears to be "expensive" and buy the investment that appears to be "cheap." The very nature of arbitrage programs is to minimize market risk. Leverage is then applied to extract the most value from their small net exposure to market risk.

A black box is just one example of process versus investment results. The hedge fund industry considers itself to be "skill-based." However, it is very difficult to translate manager skill into a process. This is particularly true when the performance of the hedge fund is dependent upon the skill of a specific individual.

Let's consider another, well publicized skill-based investment process. In the spring of 2000, the hedge funds headed by George Soros stumbled leading to the departure of Stanley Druckenmiller, the chief investment strategist for Soros Fund Management. The Wall Street Journal documented the concentrated skill-based investment style of this hedge fund group:

For years, [Soros Fund Management] fostered an entrepreneurial culture, with a cadre of employees battling wits to persuade Mr. Druckenmiller to invest.

" [Mr. Druckenmiller] didn't scream, but he could be very tough. It could be three days or three weeks of battling it out until he's convinced, or you're defeated."14

The above statement does not describe an investment process. It is a description of an individual. The hedge fund manager's investment analysis and decision-making is concentrated in one person. This is a pure example of "skill-based" investing. There is no discernible process.

Instead, all information is filtered through the brain of one individual. In essence, the institutional investor must trust the judgment of one person.

Mr. Druckenmiller compiled an exceptional track record as the manager of the Soros Quantum Fund. However, the concentration of decision-making authority is not an economic risk, it is a process risk.

Investors should accept economic risk but not process risk. Soros Fund Management is a well-known global macro hedge fund manager. From Exhibit 25.15 we can see that fundamental risks of an investment in a global macro fund are credit risk and market risk.

Investors are generally unwilling to bear risks that are not fundamental to their tactical and strategic asset allocations. Process risk is not a fundamental risk. It is an idiosyncratic risk of the hedge fund manager's structure and operations.

Generally, process risk is not a risk that investors wish to bear. Nor is it a risk for which they expect to be compensated. Furthermore, how would an investor go about pricing the process risk of a hedge fund manager? It can't be quantified, and it can't be calibrated. Therefore, there is no way to tell whether an institutional investor is being properly compensated for this risk.[15]

Process risk also raises the ancillary issue of lack of transparency. Skill-based investing usually is opaque. Are the decisions of the key individual quantitatively based? Qualitatively based? There is no way to really tell. This is similar to the problems discussed earlier with respect to black boxes.

To summarize, process risk cannot be quantified and it is not a risk that investors are willing to bear. Process risk also raises issues of transparency. Investors want clarity and definition, not opaqueness and amorphousness.

# What Makes the Hedge Fund Manager so Smart?

Before investing money with a hedge fund manager, an investor must determine one of the following. The hedge fund manager must be able to demonstrate that he or she is smarter than the next manager. One way to be smarter than another hedge fund manager is to have superior skill in filtering information. That is, the hedge fund manager must be able to look at the same information set as another manager but be able to glean more investment insight from that data set.

Alternatively, if the hedge fund manager is not smarter than the next manager, he must demonstrate that he has a better information set; his competitive advantage is not filtering information, but gathering it. To be successful, a hedge fund manager must demonstrate one or both of these competitive advantages.

Generally speaking, quantitative, computer-driven managers satisfy the first criteria. That is, hedge fund managers that run computer models access the same information set as everyone else, but have better (smarter) algorithms to extract more value per information unit than the next manager. These managers tend to be relative value managers.

Relative value managers extract value by simultaneously comparing the prices of two securities and buying and selling accordingly. This information is available to all investors in the marketplace. However, it is the relative value managers that are able to process the information quickly enough to capture mispricings in the market. These arbitrage strategies fall along the credit risk axis in Exhibit 25.15.

Alternatively, hedge fund managers that confine themselves to a particular market segment or sector generally satisfy the second criteria. They have a larger information set that allows them to gain a competitive edge in their chosen market. Their advantage is a proprietary information set accumulated over time rather than a proprietary data filtering system.

Consider the following statement from a hedge fund disclosure document:

The Adviser hopes to achieve consistently high returns by focusing on small and mid-cap companies in the biotechnology market.

The competitive advantage of this type of manager is his or her knowledge not only about a particular economic sector (biotechnology), but also, about a particular market segment of that sector (smalland mid-cap). This type of manger tends to take more market risk exposure than credit risk exposure and generally applies equity long/short programs (see Exhibit 25.15).

Identifying the competitive advantage of the hedge fund manager is the key to determining whether the hedge fund manager can sustain performance results. We indicated earlier that the issue of performance persistence is undecided.

Therefore, an investor cannot rely on historical hedge fund performance data as a means of selecting good managers from bad managers. Furthermore, every hedge fund disclosure document contains some variation of the following language:

Past performance is no indication of future results.

Essentially, this statement directs the investor to ignore the hedge fund manager's performance history.

To assess the likelihood of performance persistence, the investor must then determine whether the hedge fund manager is an information gatherer or an information filterer. Consider the following language from a hedge fund disclosure document.

The General Partner will utilize its industry expertise, contacts, and databases developed over the past 11 years to identify company investment ideas outside traditional sources and will analyze these investment opportunities using, among other techniques, many aspects of its proven methodology in determining value.

This hedge fund manager has a superior information set that has been developed over 11 years. It is an information gatherer. Consistent with Exhibit 25.15, this manager applies an equity long/short program within a specific market sector.

Finally, consider the following disclosure language from a merger arbitrage hedge fund manager:

[The] research group [is] staffed by experienced M&A lawyers with detailed knowledge of deal lifecycle, with extensive experience with corporate law of multiple U.S. states, U.S. and foreign securities laws regarding proxy contests, and antitrust laws (both of the U.S. and EU), and who have made relevant filings before regulators and have closed a wide variety of M&A transactions.

This hedge fund manager is an information filterer. Its expertise is sifting through the outstanding legal and regulatory issues associated with a merger and determining the likelihood that the deal will be completed.

To summarize, a good lesson is that successful hedge fund managers know the exact nature of their competitive advantage, and how to exploit it.

# DUE DILIGENCE FOR HEDGE FUND MANAGERS

Who should be selected as your hedge fund manager will depend on due diligence. Due diligence starts the initial process of building a relationship with a hedge fund manager. It is an unavoidable task that investors must follow in order to choose a manager. Due diligence is the process of identifying the best and the brightest of the hedge fund managers. This is where the investor must roll up her sleeves and get into the devilish details that can prove to be so elusive with hedge fund managers.

Due diligence consists of seven parts: structure, strategy, performance, risk, administrative, legal, and references. This section reviews each part of the due diligence procedure.

# Structural Review

The structural review defines the organization of the hedge fund manager. We start with the basics: how is the fund organized? It is important to remember that the hedge fund manager and the hedge fund are separate legal entities with different legal structures and identities. We then consider the structure of the hedge fund manager, any regulatory registrations, and key personnel.

# Fund Organization

The hedge fund manager may invest the hedge fund's assets through an offshore master trust account or fund. An offshore master trust account is often used to take into account the various tax domiciles of the hedge fund's investors. Often, a hedge fund manager will set up two hedge funds, one onshore (U.S.-based) and one offshore. Master trusts are typically established in tax neutral sites such as Bermuda or the Cayman Islands.

The purpose of the master trust is to invest the assets of both the onshore hedge fund and the offshore hedge fund in a consistent (if not identical) manner so that both hedge funds share the benefit of the hedge fund manager's insights. Investors in either fund are not disadvantaged by this structure. Instead, it allows the tax consequences to flow down to the tax code of each investor's domicile country.

Master trusts/funds are often viewed suspiciously as tax evasion vehicles. This is not their purpose. Their purpose is tax neutrality, not evasion. In Bermuda, for example, master trust funds do not pay any corporate income tax. They only pay a corporate licensing fee. Therefore, there are no adverse tax consequences to the hedge fund investors at the master trust level.

Instead, the tax consequences for the investors will depend upon their domicile. Investors in the onshore U.S.-based hedge fund are subject to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Investors in the offshore fund are subject to the tax code of their respective domicile. Therefore, master trust vehicles are used to accommodate the different tax domiciles of foreign and domestic investors.

EXHIBIT 25.16 Master Trust Account

Consider a hedge fund manager who has two investors: one based in the United States and one in France. Where should she locate her hedge fund? If she locates the hedge fund in the United States, the U.S. investor will be happy, but the French investor may have to pay double the income taxes: both in the United States and in France. The best way to resolve this problem is to set up two hedge funds, one onshore and one offshore. In addition, a master trust account is established in a tax neutral site. The hedge fund manager can then invest the assets of both hedge funds through the master trust account and each investor will be liable only for the taxes imposed by the revenue code of their respective countries.[16] Exhibit 25.16 demonstrates the master trust structure.

Hedge fund structures do not have to be as complicated as that presented in Exhibit 25.16. The majority of hedge fund managers in the United States operate only within the United States, have only an onshore hedge fund, and accept only U.S. investors. Nonetheless, the popularity of hedge fund investing has resulted in operating structures that are sometimes as creative as the hedge fund strategies themselves.

# Hedge Fund Manager Organization

First, the basics: where is the hedge fund manager located, are there any satellite offices, and where is the nearest office to the investor? These questions can be very important if the hedge fund manager operates overseas and there are significant time differences between the manager's business hours and that of the investor.

Second, an organization chart is mandatory. Who is the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Investment Officer, and Chief Operating Officer? A warning: It is not a good business plan if they are all the same person. Hedge fund managers should do what they do best: invest money and leave the operating details to someone else.

Of special importance is the Chief Financial Officer. The CFO will be the investor's most important link with the hedge fund manager after an investment is made because the CFO will be responsible for reporting the hedge fund manager's performance numbers. Consequently, the investor should make certain that the CFO has a strong background in accounting, preferably a Certified Public Accountant, a Chartered Accountant, or another professional accounting designation. Last, the investor must determine who are the senior managers in charge of trading, information systems, marketing, and research and development.

The educational and professional background of all principals should be documented. It should be determined whether they have graduate degrees, whether there are any Chartered Financial Analysts, and what was their prior investment experience before starting a hedge fund.

Another warning: Many equity long/short hedge fund managers were former long-only managers. Yet, shorting stocks is very different than going long stocks. The ability to locate and borrow stock, limit losses in a bull market, and short on the uptick rule are special talents that cannot be developed overnight.

Before investing money with a long/short hedge fund manager, an investor should find out where the hedge fund manager learned to short stocks. If it is a hedge fund manager that previously managed a long-only portfolio, chances are that she might not have much experience with respect to shorting stocks, and therefore, will be learning to short stocks with your money.

# Ownership

Ownership of the hedge fund manager must be documented. It is important to know who owns the company that advises the hedge fund. This is important for "key person" provisions of the contractual documentation.

Additionally, ownership is important for ensuring that there is a proper alignment of interests with the hedge fund manager's employees as well as retention of employment. By sharing the ownership of the hedge fund management company with key employees, the hedge fund manager can ensure proper alignment of interests as well as retention of key personnel.

# Registrations

The investor should document the regulatory registrations of the hedge fund manager. The hedge fund manager might be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an Investment Adviser under the Investment Adviser's Act of 1940. If so, the hedge fund manager must file annually Form ADV with the SEC that contains important financial and structural information regarding the hedge fund manager.

Alternatively, the hedge fund manager might be registered with the National Futures Association (NFA) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as either a Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) or a Commodity Pool Operator (CPO). The NFA is the self-regulatory organization for the managed futures industry. It is approved by the CFTC to handle all registrations for CTAs and CPOs. Also, the hedge fund manager might be registered with the NFA as an introducing broker or futures commission merchant. If, the hedge fund manager is registered as either a CTA, CPO, introducing broker or futures commission merchant, it must obey the rules and regulations of the NFA and the CFTC.

If the hedge fund manager is registered with either the SEC or the CFTC, the investor should ascertain the date of the original registration, and whether there are any civil, criminal or administrative actions outstanding against the hedge fund manager. This information must be filed with either the NFA (for the managed futures industry) or the SEC (for investment advisers).

# Outside Service Providers

The investor must document who is the hedge fund manager's outside auditors, prime broker, and legal counsel. Each of these service providers must be contacted.

First, the investor should receive the hedge fund manager's last annual audited financial statement as well as the most current statement. Any questions regarding the financial statements should be directed to the CFO and the outside auditors. Any opinion from the auditors other than an unqualified opinion must be explained by the outside auditors. Additionally, outside auditors are a good source of information regarding the hedge fund manager's accounting system and operations.

The hedge fund manager's prime broker is responsible for executing the hedge fund manager's trades, lending securities to short, and providing short-term financing for leverage. It is essential that the investor contact the prime broker because the prime broker is in the best position to observe the hedge fund manager's trading positions.

There was an incident on President's Day in 1997 where a prime broker contacted one of its hedge fund manager clients and demanded a margin call. In a margin call the prime broker demands that the hedge fund manager post more cash or collateral to cover either her short positions or her borrowing from the manager.

Margin calls can happen for several reasons. First and foremost, a short position can move against a hedge fund manager creating a large negative balance with the hedge fund manager's prime broker. To protect itself from the credit exposure to the hedge fund manager, the prime broker will make a margin call. In effect, demanding that the hedge fund manager either put up cash or more securities as collateral to cover the prime broker's credit exposure to the hedge fund manager.

Finally, the investor should speak with the hedge fund manager's outside counsel. This is important for two reasons. First, outside counsel is typically responsible for keeping current all regulatory registrations of the hedge fund manager. Second, outside counsel can inform the investor of any criminal, civil, or administrative actions that might be pending against the hedge fund manager. Outside counsel is also responsible for preparing the hedge fund managers offering document. This is with whom the investor will negotiate should an investment be made with the hedge fund manager.

# Strategic Review

The second phase of due diligence is a review of the hedge fund manager's investment strategy. This should include a clear statement of the hedge fund manager's style, the markets in which she invests, what competitive advantage the hedge fund manager brings to the table, the source of her investment ideas, and what benchmark, if any, is appropriate for the hedge fund.

# Investment Style

Earlier in this chapter, we listed several styles of hedge fund managers. While these are the major hedge fund styles, they are by no means exhaustive. The creativity of hedge fund managers is such that there are as many styles as there are colors of the rainbow.

For instance, relative value arbitrage is a hedge fund style frequently seen. Recall that relative value arbitrage compares two similar securities and buys the security that is "cheap" relative to the other security while selling the security that is relatively "rich." Relative value arbitrage can be subdivided into economic arbitrage and statistical arbitrage. Economic arbitrage compares the pricing fundamentals of two similar securities to determine if the prices set by the market are inconsistent with the fundamentals. If an inconsistency is identified, the "cheap" security is purchased and the "rich" security is sold. The hedge fund manager will hold on to these positions until the market corrects itself and the two security prices are in proper balance. This holding period may be a day, week, or several months. In some cases, it may be necessary to hold the two securities to maturity (in the case of bonds). Conversely, "stat arb" is another form of relative value arbitrage where the trading is based not on economic fundamentals, but rather, on statistical anomalies that temporarily occur in the market. Typically, these anomalies occur only for a moment or for a day at most. Consequently, statistical arbitrage is a very short-term relative value trading program with positions entered and exited within the same trading day.

Additionally, economic relative value or statistical arbitrage can occur in the fixed income, equity, or convertible bond markets. Exhibit 25.17 diagrams how an investment strategy should be documented.

# Investment Markets

Next, the investor should document in which markets the hedge fund manager invests. Recall this was one of our basic questions presented earlier in this chapter. For an equity long/short manager, the answer is obvious. Recall the following language:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/34152bb9-0c82-464c-8d95-33ab992e7f99/dcdc8df8ac66188a59f2e871e65bc505760c316470ef863199cbfe33eb45dae3.jpg)

EXHIBIT 25.17 Documenting a Hedge Fund Investment Strategy

The Fund's investment objective is to make investments in public securities that generate a long-term return in excess of that generated by the overall U.S. public equity market while reducing the market risk of the portfolio through selective short positions.

From this statement, it is clear that this manager is an equity long/short manager investing in the U.S. equity market.

For other hedge fund managers, however, the answer is not so obvious. For instance, global macro managers typically have the broadest investment mandate possible. They can invest across the world equity, bond, commodity and currency markets. Pinning down a global macro manager may be akin to picking up mercury. Nonetheless, the investor should document as best she can in what markets the hedge fund manager invests. If the hedge fund manager is a global macro manager, the investor may have to accept that the manager can and will invest in whatever market it deems fit.

The investor should also determine the extent to which the hedge fund manager invests in derivative securities. Derivatives are a two-edged sword. On the one hand they can hedge an investment portfolio and reduce risk. On the other hand, they can increase the leverage of the hedge fund and magnify the risks taken by the hedge fund manager.

# Investment Securities

Closely related to the investment markets are the types of securities in which the hedge fund manager invests. For some strategies, it will be straightforward. For instance, the sample language provided above indicates that the hedge fund manager will invest in the stock of U.S. companies.

However, other strategies will not be so clear. Recall the language where one hedge fund manager listed every security, futures contract, option, and derivative contract "in each case whether now existing or created in the future." This manager needs to be pinned down, and the due diligence checklist is the place to do it.

Oftentimes, hedge fund disclosure documents are drafted in very broad and expansive terms. The reason is that the hedge fund manager does not want to be legally bound into an investment corner. The purpose of due diligence is not to legally bind the hedge fund manager but to document the types of securities necessary to effect her investment strategy.

It is very important that the investor determine the hedge fund manager's strategy for using derivatives, the type of derivatives used, and in which markets will derivatives be purchased. Of particular concern is the extent to which hedge fund manager may "short volatility."

Shorting volatility is a strategy where hedge fund managers sell out of the money call or put options against their investment portfolio. If the options expire unexercised, the hedge fund manager receives the option premiums and this increases the return for the hedge fund. However, if the options are exercised against the hedge fund manager, significant negative results may occur.

# Benchmark

Establishing a benchmark for hedge fund managers is one of the thorniest issues facing the industry. One reason is the skill-based nature of their investment styles. Manager skill cannot be captured by a passive securities benchmark. Skill, in fact, is orthogonal to passive investing.

Second, most hedge fund managers apply investment strategies that cannot be captured by a passive securities index. For instance, it can be argued that a long-only passive equity index is not an appropriate benchmark for derivative instruments, such as options, that have nonlinear payout functions. Passive securities indices do not reflect non-linear payout strategies.

Last, hedge fund managers tend to maintain concentrated portfolios. The nature of this concentration makes the investment strategy of the hedge fund manager distinct from a broad-based securities index.

Nonetheless, some performance measure must be established for the hedge fund manager. For instance, if the hedge fund manager runs a long/short equity fund concentrating on the semi-conductor sector of the technology industry, a good benchmark would be the SOX/semi-conductor index maintained by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.

If the hedge fund manager does not believe that any index is appropriate for his strategy, then a hurdle rate must be established. Hurdle rates are most appropriate for absolute return hedge fund managers whose rate of return is not dependent upon the general economic prospects of a sector or a broad-based market index. Generally, these rates are set at the Treasury bill or LIBOR rate plus a spread.

# Competitive Advantage

Recall our question posed earlier in this chapter: What makes the hedge fund manager so smart? We made the point that the best hedge fund managers know the exact nature of their competitive advantage, and how to exploit it. This advantage must be documented as part of the due diligence process.

Another way to ask this question, is: What makes the hedge fund manager different from the other managers? For instance, there are many merger arbitrage managers. However, some invest only in announced deals while some speculate on potential deals. Some merger arbitrage funds invest in cross-border deals while others stay strictly within the boundaries of their domicile. Some participate in deals only of a certain market capitalization ranges while others are across the board. And finally, some merger arbitrage funds use options and convertible securities to capture the merger premium while others invest only in the underlying equity.

As another competitive advantage, some merger arbitrage experts develop large in-house legal staffs to review the regulatory (anti-trust) implications of the announced deals. These managers rely on their expert legal analysis to determine whether the existing merger premium is rich or cheap. They exploit the legal issues associated with the merger instead of the economic issues.

# Current Portfolio Position

This part of the due diligence is meant to provide a current snapshot of the hedge fund. First, the investor should ascertain the fund's current long versus short exposure. Additionally, the investor should determine the amount of cash that the hedge fund manager is keeping and why. Too much cash indicates an investment strategy that may be stuck in neutral.

The investor should also ascertain how many investments the hedge fund manager currently maintains in the fund. As we have previously discussed, hedge fund managers typically run concentrated exposure. Therefore, the investor is exposed to more stock specific risk than market risk. Again, this is the essence of hedge fund management: hedge fund managers do not take market risk, they take security specific risk. This stock or security specific risk is the source of the hedge fund manager's returns.

Last, the investor should ask the hedge fund manager how she has positioned the hedge fund portfolio in light of current market conditions. This should provide insight not only as to how the hedge fund manager views the current financial markets, but also her investment strategy going forward.

# Source of Investment Ideas

What is the source of the hedge fund manager's investment ideas? Does she wait until "it just hits her?" Conversely, is there a rigorous process for sourcing investment ideas. Idea generation is what hedge fund investing is all about. This is the source of the manager's skill.

The source of investment ideas is closely tied in with the nature of competitive advantage. The hedge fund manager's competitive advantage could be her research department that generates investment ideas better or faster than other hedge fund managers. Conversely, some hedge fund man agers, such as merger arbitrage managers, wait for deals to be announced in the market.

In addition, the investor should determine in which type of market does the hedge fund manager's ideas work best. Do they work best in bear markets, bull markets, flat markets, or none at all. For instance, an absolute return hedge fund manager (a manager with a hurdle rate for a benchmark) should be agnostic with respect to the direction of the market. Otherwise, an argument could be made that the hedge fund manager's performance should be compared to a market index.

# Capacity

A frequent issue with hedge fund managers is the capacity of their investment strategy. Hedge fund manager's have investment strategies that are more narrowly focused than traditional long-only managers. As a consequence, their investment strategies frequently have limited capacity. This is more the case for hedge fund managers that target small sectors of the economy or segments of the financial markets.

For instance, the convertible bond market is much smaller than the U.S. equity market. Consequently, a convertible bond hedge fund manager may have more limited capacity than an equity long/short manager. Global macro hedge fund managers, with their global investment mandate, have the largest capacity. This large capacity is derived from their unlimited ability to invest across financial instruments, currencies, borders, and commodities.

Capacity is an important issue for the investor because the hedge fund manager might dilute her skill by allowing a greater number of investors into the hedge fund than is optimal from an investment standpoint. This may result in too much money chasing too few deals.

# PERFORMANCE REVIEW

# List of Funds and Assets Under Management

First, the investor should document how many hedge funds the hedge fund manager advises and the assets under management for each fund. The investor should know the size of the hedge fund manager's empire. This is important not only for the collection of performance data, but also it may give the investor some sense of the hedge fund manager's investment capacity.

There are three important questions to ask. How long has the hedge fund manager been actively managing a hedge fund? Have her perform mance results been consistent over time? Are the investment strategies the same or different for each hedge fund?

We noted earlier that the attrition rate in the hedge fund is very high, up to  $15\%$  a year according to one study. Successful hedge fund managers have a long-term track record with consistent results. However, "long-term" in the hedge fund industry is a relative term. For hedge funds, five years is generally sufficient to qualify as long-term.

Additionally, if a hedge fund manager manages more than one hedge fund, the investment strategy and style should be documented for both. If the hedge funds follow the same style, then the issue of trade allocation must be resolved. The investor should determine how the hedge fund manager decides what trades go into which hedge fund.

# Drawdowns

Drawdowns are a common phenomenon in the hedge fund industry. Simply defined, a drawdown is a decline in the net asset value of the hedge fund. Drawdowns are not unique to the hedge fund industry, they also occur in the mutual fund industry. However, in the long-only world of mutual funds, drawdowns are often motivated by declines in market indices. This reflects the market risk associated with mutual funds.

The difference with hedge funds is that they eschew market risk in favor of stock specific risk. The amount of stock specific risk in the hedge fund is reflective of the hedge fund manager's skill level of finding overpriced and underpriced securities regardless of the condition of the general financial markets. Therefore, drawdowns in the hedge fund world indicate a lapse of hedge fund manager skill.

Hedge fund managers often claim that their industry is skill-based. This claim is a two-edged sword. On the one hand, it protects hedge fund managers from being compared to a passive long-only index as a benchmark. On the other hand, it also means that when the hedge fund declines in value, the blame rests solely with the hedge fund manager and not with the condition of the financial markets.

Therefore, it is important to measure how much a lapse of hedge fund manager skill cost the fund, and how long it took for the hedge fund manager to regain her skill and recoup the losses. Last, the hedge fund manager should explain her temporary loss of skill.

# Statistical Data

This section covers the basic summary information that is expected of all active managers. The average return over the life of the fund as well as the standard deviation (volatility) of returns and the Sharpe ratio.

As an aside, Sharpe ratios can be misleading statistics when measuring hedge fund performance because of the non-linear strategies that hedge fund managers can pursue.

Additionally, if a benchmark can be identified for the hedge fund, then the systematic risk of the hedge fund with that benchmark should be measured. This statistic is known as the beta of the hedge fund and it measures the extent by which the hedge fund returns move in tandem with the benchmark.

Also, if a benchmark is identified, then an Information Ratio (IR) statistic can be calculated. This is the excess return of the hedge fund (the returns to the hedge fund minus the returns to the benchmark) divided by the standard deviation of the excess returns. The IR measures the amount of active return that is earned for each unit of active risk exposure. As a rule of thumb, successful long-only managers generally earn an IR between 0.25 to 0.50. With respect to hedge funds, an investor should expect to receive an IR between 1 and 1.5.

# Withdrawals

Withdrawals can be detrimental to fund performance. If a hedge fund manager is fully invested at the time of a redemption request, fund performance will suffer. First, the hedge fund manager must sell securities to fund the withdrawal. This means transaction costs that would not otherwise be incurred will be charged to the fund and will be borne by all investors. Additionally, to the extent that a hedge fund manager cannot liquidate a portion of her investment strategy on a pro rata basis to fund the withdrawal, there may be a loss to the hedge fund from foregone investment opportunities.

Finally, the less liquid the securities in which the hedge fund manager invests, the greater will be these costs. Equity long/short hedge funds usually have the lowest cost associated with a withdrawal because the equity markets are typically the most liquid markets in which to transact. However, more arcane investment strategies and securities such as mortgage-backed arbitrage can have significant costs associated with a withdrawal.

Recall the incident discussed above with respect to a prime broker executing a margin call on President's Day to a mortgage-backed hedge fund manager. The timing of the margin call had severe implications for fund performance. A withdrawal request is similar to a margin call in that a hedge fund investor demands that the hedge fund manager liquidate some of her positions to fund the redemption request. The results, if unexpected, can have a negative impact on fund performance.

# RISK REVIEW

# Risk Management

Three important questions must be answered: What risks are managed? How is risk measured? How is risk managed?

First, it is important to determine what risks the hedge fund manage monitors. Does she have limits on the percentage of the portfolio that may be invested in any one company or security? Additionally, does the manager monitor her gross long exposure, gross short exposure, and net market exposure? To what extent can the manager be long and to what extent can she be short the market?

Risk can be measured through measures of standard deviation, semi-variance, Sortino measures, by value-at-risk, and by style analysis. The investor must document what type of risk measurement system the hedge fund manager applies.

Last, the investor must determine how the hedge fund manager manages the risk of her positions. As indicated above, one way to control risk is by setting limits on the size of any investment position. This is particularly important because of the concentrated nature of most hedge fund portfolios.

Another way to manage risk is to set an upper boundary on the standard deviation of the hedge fund's returns. Alternatively, the hedge fund manager could set a limit on the amount of active risk (the standard deviation of excess returns) in the hedge fund.

Two additional risks that must be discussed are short volatility risk and counterparty risk. As already mentioned, hedge fund managers can sell options as part of their investment strategy. When a hedge fund manager sells an option, she collects the option premium at the time of the sale. If the option expires unexercised, the hedge fund manager keeps the option premium and the hedge fund's returns will be increased by the amount of the option premium. However, if the option is exercised against the manager, this may have a negative impact on the hedge fund performance.

Additionally, hedge fund managers frequently trade in over-the-counter derivative instruments. These are essentially private contracts between two parties: the hedge fund manager and her counterparty. The counterparty to such trades is often a large Wall Street investment house or large money center bank. Nonetheless, when a hedge fund manager negotiates these custom derivative contracts with a counterparty, the hedge fund manager takes on the credit risk that her counterparty will fulfill its obligations under the derivative contract.

Exchange-traded derivative contracts such as listed futures and options contracts do not have this counterparty risk because the clearinghouse for the exchange will make good on any defaulted contract. However, in the over-the-counter world of derivatives, the hedge fund manager must rely on its counterparty's good faith and credit to perform its obligations under the derivative contract.

In sum, the investor must determine how the hedge fund manager looks at risk, what are the most important risk exposures in the portfolio, and how the hedge fund manager reacts to excess risk.

# Leverage

Some hedge fund managers specifically limit the leverage they will employ. This limit is typically set in the limited partnership agreement so that the hedge fund manager is legally bound to stay within a leverage limit. Nonetheless, within the leverage limit the hedge fund manager has considerable flexibility. Also, many hedge fund managers never set a limit on the amount of leverage that they may apply.

If leverage is applied, the investor should document the highest amount of leverage used by the hedge fund manager as well as the average leverage of the fund since inception. As we indicated earlier, one of the reasons for the demise of Long Term Capital Management was the massive amount of leverage employed in its strategy. While leverage can be a successful tool if employed correctly, it will have a significantly detrimental impact on hedge fund performance during periods of minimal liquidity.

# Risk Officer

Last, and most important, who monitors risk? The chief investment officer and the chief risk officer should not be the same person. If so, there is a conflict in risk control because risk management should function separately from investment management. Without this independence, there can be no assurance that risk will be properly identified and managed.

Often the chief financial officer serves as the risk officer. This is a good solution as long as the CFO is not also the chief investment officer (rarely is this the case). In the smaller hedge fund shops, this is the usual procedure. However, larger hedge funds have established a chief risk officer who monitors the hedge fund manager's positions across all hedge funds and separate accounts.

If the amount of leverage is not contractually specified in the limited partnership agreement, then the risk manager must set the limit. Even if there is a limit on leverage, the risk manager must monitor the leverage in each hedge fund to ensure that it is consistent with that fund's investmeant strategy. Finally, the risk manager should establish the position limits for any one investment within a hedge fund portfolio.

# ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW

# Civil, Criminal, and Regulatory Actions

The hedge fund manager should fully disclose all civil, criminal and regulatory actions against the hedge fund manager or any of its principals over the past five years. Normally a three-year history is asked for, but five years is also common.

The hedge fund manager may balk at listing civil or criminal actions previously or currently pending against its principals. However, in addition to the expected red flags that legal actions raise, this is necessary information for two more reasons.

First, a history of civil or criminal actions filed against one of the hedge fund manager's principals is a valuable insight into that principal's character. Given the litigious nature of current society, it would not be unusual for a principal to be involved in a civil lawsuit outside the operating business of the hedge fund. However, a pattern of such lawsuits might indicate trouble.

Second, lawsuits are distracting. They take a toll in terms of time, money, and emotions. Such a distraction could impede a principal's performance with respect to the hedge fund.

# Employee Turnover

Given the skill-based nature (or claim, thereof) of the hedge fund industry, a hedge fund manager's personnel is its most valuable resource. This is where the skill resides.

A complete list of hired and departing employees is important for three reasons. First, as previously discussed, a good hedge fund manager knows her competitive advantage and how to exploit it. One type of competitive advantage is the people employed by the hedge fund manager. Preserving this workforce may be one of the keys to maintaining her advantage.

Second, similar to lawsuits, turnover is distracting. It takes time, money, and sometimes emotions to recruit new talent. Additionally, new employees take time to come up the learning curve and comprehend all of the nuances of a hedge fund manager's investment strategy.

Last, high employee turnover may be indicative of a volatile Chief Executive Officer. If the employees do not have faith enough in the CEO to remain with the hedge fund manager, why should the investor?

# Account Representative

This is very simple. A primary contact person should be designated. This representative will handle issues regarding performance, withdrawals, increased investment, distributions, and meetings. Ideally it should be someone other than the Chief Executive Officer, whose job it is to keep the hedge fund manager on course rather than take client phone calls.

# Disaster Planning

Disaster planning was particularly important with the Y2K concerns. However, its import has not been diminished with the passing of the new millennium. Unfortunately, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 demonstrated the continued need for disaster planning. Hedge fund managers employ sophisticated trading models that require considerable computing power. This is especially true for those hedge fund managers that employ quantitative arbitrage models.

The hedge fund manager should have a recovery plan if a natural or other disaster shuts down its trading and investment operations. This plan could be leasing space at a disaster recover site owned by a computer service provider, a back up trading desk at another remote location, or the sharing of facilities with other trading desks.

Consider the simple case of a power "brown-out." How would the hedge fund manager monitor its investment positions? How would it monitor its risks? How would it trade without the use of its analytical computer programs? The hedge fund manager must have a back-up plan to address these questions.

# LEGAL REVIEW

# Type of Investment

Most hedge fund investments are structured as limited partnerships. Limited partnership units are purchased by the investor where the number of units that the investor owns entitles her to a pro rata share of the returns earned by the hedge fund.

Some hedge fund managers offer separate accounts for their investors. These are individual investment accounts that are dedicated solely to one investor. There are pros and cons of both types of investments.

In a limited partnership structure, the hedge fund manager acts as the general partner, and invests a portion of her own capital in the hedge fund side by side that of the limited partners. This ensures an alignment of interests between the hedge fund manager and her investors.

Also, a limited partnership provides a "financial firewall" for the investor. Limited partnership laws protect the limited partners so that they are at risk only to the extent of their capital committed. Therefore, the limited partner's maximum downside is known with certainty. Any excess risk is borne by the hedge fund manager as the general partner.

Separate accounts do not have the advantages of alignment of interests or financial firewalls. There is more risk associated with this type of investment. However, there are two advantages of a separate account.

First, the investor need only worry about her own motivations. In our section on Performance Review, we discussed how withdrawals of capital from a hedge fund can be detrimental to the fund's performance. Therefore, the withdrawal of capital by one limited partner could disadvantage the remaining investors in the hedge fund. With a separate account, this issue does not exist because there is only one investor per account.

Second, separate accounts facilitate reporting and risk management. In a limited partnership, the investor receives her pro rata share of the fund's return and owns a pro rata share of each individual investment. Reporting these pro rata shares, or aggregating them for risk management purposes, can be cumbersome. However, with a separate account, all gains, losses, and investments are owned  $100\%$  by the investor. This simplifies any reporting or risk management requirements.

# Fees

The standard in the hedge fund industry is "1 and 20." This means a  $1\%$  management fee and a  $20\%$  profit sharing or incentive fee. However, this structure is by no means uniform. Some of the larger hedge funds charge up to a  $3\%$  management fee and a  $30\%$  incentive fee, while some newer hedge funds may charge less than the standard "1 and 20."

In addition to the fee structure, the investor should determine how frequently fees are collected. Typically, management fees are collected on a quarterly basis, but they may also be structured semiannually or annually. Incentive fees are usually collected on an annual basis.

The investor should also determine if there is a "high watermark" or a "clawback" with respect to the incentive fees. A high watermark means that a hedge fund manager cannot collect any incentive fee until she exceeds the highest previous net asset value.

This is particularly important because of the nature of drawdowns. If a hedge fund manager suffers a drawdown, she should not collect any incentive fees while she recoups this lost value. Incentive fees should begin only after the manager has regained the lost fund value and produced new value for her investors. Most hedge funds have high watermarks.

Clawbacks are rare in the hedge fund world. They are much more common in the private equity marketplace. As its name implies, a clawback provision allows the investors in the fund to "claw back" incentive fees previously received by the hedge fund manager. Clawback arrangements generally apply if, over the life of the fund, the hedge fund manager has failed to produce an agreed upon hurdle rate.

# Lockups and Redemptions

While lock-up periods are the standard in the private equity world, they are much less common in hedge funds. However, more and more hedge funds are requiring lock-up periods for their investors. A lock-up period is just that: the investors' capital is "locked-up" for a designated period. During this time, the investor cannot redeem any part of her investment.

Lock-up periods provide two benefits. First, they give the hedge fund manager time to implement her investment strategy. Imagine how difficult it might be to implement a sophisticated investment strategy while at the same time worrying about how to fund redemption requests.

Second, we have already pointed out that ill-timed withdrawals of capital by one limited partner in a hedge fund can disadvantage the remaining investors. During the lock-up period, this is not an issue. Nervous investors have no choice but to have their capital committed for a specified period of time. Confident investors can be assured that their investment will not be undermined by a fickle limited partner.

Withdrawals and redemptions are specified in the limited partnership agreement. Some hedge funds provide monthly liquidity, but the norm is quarterly or semi-annual redemption rights. Also, limited partners typically must give notice to the hedge fund manager that they intend to redeem. This notice period can be from 30 to 90 days in advance of the redemption. The purpose of the notice is to give the hedge fund manager the ability to position the hedge fund's portfolio to finance the redemption request.

# Subscription Amount

All hedge funds have a minimum subscription amount. Generally, this amount is quite high for two reasons. First, the hedge fund manager needs sufficient investment capital to implement his investment strategy. Second, higher capital commitments ensure that only sophisticated investors with a large net worth will subscribe in the hedge fund. Hedge fund investing is not for the average investor. Rather, they are designed for sophisticated investors who can appreciate and accept the risks associated with hedge funds.

Some hedge funds may also have a maximum subscription amount. This is done so that no single investor becomes too large relative to other investors in the fund. Also, the hedge fund manager may have capacity issues that require limits on an investor's capital contribution.

# Advisory Committee

Advisory committees serve as a source of objective input for the hedge fund manager. They are comprised of representatives from the hedge fund manager and investors in the hedge fund.

Advisory committees may provide advice on the valuation of certain investments, particularly illiquid investments. The committee may advise the hedge fund manager when it is time to mark down or mark up an illiquid security where objective market prices are not available.

The advisory committee may also advise the hedge fund manager as to whether she should open up the hedge fund for new investors, and how much more capacity the hedge fund manager should take. Before, allowing new investors into the fund, the hedge fund manager may wish to seek the counsel of the advisory committee to see if the existing investors have concerns about capacity or the types of additional investors that may be allowed to invest.

While advisory committees are a useful device for control by the hedge fund limited partners, they are more common in the private equity world than with hedge funds. We will discuss this point further in our chapter on cross over funds.

# REFERENCE CHECKS

# Service Providers

We indicated previously, in the Structural Review section, the importance of speaking with a hedge fund manager's primary service providers. For instance, with respect to the outside auditors, the investor should ask when the last audit was conducted and whether the auditors issued an unqualified opinion. Additionally, the investor should inquire about any issues that outside auditors have raised with the hedge fund manager over the course of their engagement.

With respect to the prime broker, the investor should inquire how frequently margin calls have been made, the size of the calls, and whether any calls have not been met. Remember that the prime broker is in the best position to evaluate the market value of the hedge fund manager's investments. A discussion with the prime broker should give the investor a reality check whether or not the hedge fund manager is recognizing the proper value of the hedge fund's portfolio.

Legal counsel is important to check on the veracity of any civil, criminal, or regulatory actions against the hedge fund manager or its principals. This conversation should confirm those actions listed by the hedge fund manager under the Administrative Review. Last, the legal counsel can confirm the status of any regulatory registrations under which the hedge fund manager operates.

# Existing Clients

Talking to existing clients is a necessary step to check the veracity of the hedge fund manager's statements and to measure his "client responsiveness."

Typical questions to ask are: Have the financial reports been timely? Have the reports been easy to understand? Has the hedge fund manager responded positively to questions about financial performance? Has the hedge fund manager done what she said she would do (maintain her investment strategy)? What concerns does the current investor have regarding the hedge fund manager of the hedge fund's performance? Would the existing client invest more money with the hedge fund manager?

In sum, this is a chance for a prospective investor to ask current investors for their candid opinion of the hedge fund manager. If the prospective investor has any doubts regarding the hedge fund manager, these doubts should be either confirmed or dispelled.

The private equity sector purchases the private stock or equity-linked securities of non-public companies that are expected to go public or provides the capital for public companies (or their divisions) that may wish to go private. The key component in either case is the private nature of the securities purchased. Private equity, by definition, is not publicly traded. Therefore, investments in private equity are illiquid. Investors in this marketplace must be prepared to invest for the long haul; investment horizons may be as extended as 5 to 10 years.

"Private equity" is a generic term that encompasses four distinct strategies in the market for private investing. First, there is venture capital, the financing of start-up companies. Second, there are leveraged buyouts (LBOs) where public companies repurchase all of their outstanding shares and turn themselves into private companies. Third, there is mezzanine financing, a hybrid of private debt and equity financing. Last, there is distressed debt investing. These are private equity investments in established (as opposed to start-up) but troubled companies.

# VENTURE CAPITAL

Venture capital is the supply of equity financing to start-up companies that do not have a sufficient track record to attract investment capital from traditional sources (e.g., the public markets or lending institutions). Entrepreneurs that develop business plans require investment capital to implement those plans. However, these start-up ventures often lack tangible assets that can be used as collateral for a loan. In addition, start-up companies are unlikely to produce positive earnings for several years. Negative cash flows are another reason why banks and other lending institutions as well as the public stock market are unwilling to provide capital to support the business plan.

It is in this uncertain space where nascent companies are born that venture capitalists operate. Venture capitalists finance these high-risk, illiquid, and unproven ideas by purchasing senior equity stakes while the firms are still privately held. The ultimate goal is to make a buck. Venture capitalists are willing to underwrite new ventures with untested products and bear the risk of no liquidity only if they can expect a reasonable return for their efforts. Often, venture capitalists set expected target rates of return of  $33\%$  or more to support the risks they bear. Successful startup companies funded by venture capital money include Cisco Systems, Cray Research, Microsoft, and Genentech.

Initially, ERISA guidelines prohibited pension funds from investing in venture capital funds because of their illiquid and high-risk status. In 1979, the Department of Labor (which oversees ERISA) issued a clarification of the prudent person rule to indicate that venture capital and other high-risk investments should not be considered on a stand-alone basis, but rather on a portfolio basis. In addition, the rule clarified that the prudent person test is based on an investment review process and not on the ultimate outcome of investment results. Therefore, as long as a pension fund investment fiduciary follows sufficient due diligence in considering the portfolio effects of investing in venture capital, the prudent person test is met. The change in the prudent person rule allowed pension funds for the first time to wholly endorse venture capital investing.

Exhibit 26.1 demonstrates the returns to venture capital compared to the S&P 500 over a 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year investment horizon (1991-2000). We include the returns for late stage, early stage, and balanced venture capital funds. We can see that over each time horizon, the returns to venture capital dominate those of the S&P 500. This should be expected because investors should be compensated for the risk of startup companies and the lack of liquidity of their holdings.

The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year returns to venture capital appear excessive compared to the broader stock market. These returns were fueled by excessively optimistic expectations concerning the ability of new Internet companies to earn extraordinary profits as well as an extraordinarily robust U.S. economy.

A more realistic appraisal of venture capital returns is the 10-year horizon. Over a full economic cycle, venture capital returns should be expected to earn a premium over the public stock market of  $5\%$  to  $7\%$ . Over the 10-year cycle, for example, balanced and late stage venture capital investments earned a premium over the S&P 500 of  $8\%$  and  $10\%$ , respectively. Exhibit 26.1 demonstrates this long-term premium.

The new millennium began with a bang, but by the end of its first full year of 2000, ended with a whimper. The Nasdaq stock market, the primary listing ground for private companies going public through IPOs, came crashing down to earth. Throughout the late 1990s, the valuations associated with companies listed on the Nasdaq became inflated compared to companies listed in the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones 30 Industrial Companies. The Nasdaq tracked closely the valuations of the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones until the beginning of 1999. Then valuations began to diverge with the Nasdaq soaring in value compared to the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones. This created a valuation "bubble" fueled by the belief that technology stocks would take over the world. However, the bubble in burst in 2000 when new technology companies failed to produce the earnings and revenue growth forecast by optimistic Wall Street analysts. By the beginning of 2001, these three stock indices had converged back to similar values.

Going forward in the new decade of the 2000s, rational pricing has come back to the stock market as well as the venture capital market. The decline in optimism has reduced the cash flows to venture capital funds. Commitments to venture capital funds in the first six months of 2001 were  $21.4 billion, a decline of$ 27.7 billion from the first six months of 2000. Also, there were only 18 initial public offerings of U.S. companies in the first quarter of 2001, compared to 135 IPOs in the first quarter of 2000.

# The Role of a Venture Capitalist

Venture capitalists have two roles within the industry. Raising money from investors is just the first part. The second is to invest that capital with startup companies.

Venture capitalists are not passive investors. Once they invest in a company, they take an active role either in an advisory capacity or as a director on the board of the company. They monitor the progress of the company, implement incentive plans for the entrepreneurs and management, and establish financial goals for the company.

Besides providing management insight, venture capitalists usually have the right to hire and fire key mangers, including the original entrepreneur. They also provide access to consultants, accountants, lawyers, investment bankers, and most importantly, other business that might purchase the start-up company's product.

In seeking viable start-up companies to finance, venture capitalists focus on certain aspects of the entrepreneur's business opportunity. These are a business plan, intellectual property rights, prior history of the company, prior history of the management team, regulatory matters, and an exit plan.

# Business Plans

The most important document upon which a venture capitalist will base her decision to invest in a start-up company is the business plan. The business plan must be comprehensive, coherent, and internally consistent. It must clearly state the business strategy, identify the niche that the new company will fill, and describe the resources needed to fill that niche.

The business plan also reflects the start-up management team's ability to develop and present an intelligent and strategic plan of action. Therefore, the business plan not only describes the business opportunity but also gives the venture capitalist an insight to the viability of the management team.

Last, the business plan must be realistic. One part of every business plan is the assumptions about revenue growth, cash burn rate, additional rounds of capital injection, and expected date of profitability and/or IPO status. The financial goals stated in the business plan must be achievable. Additionally, financial milestones identified in the business plan can become important conditions for the vesting of management equity, the release of deferred investment commitments, and the control of the board of directors.

# Intellectual Property Rights

Most start-ups in the technology and other growth sectors base their business opportunity on the claim to proprietary technology. It is very impor tant that a start-up's claim and rights to that intellectual property be absolute. Any intellectual property owned by the company must be clearly and unequivocally assigned to the company by third parties (usually the entrepreneur and management team). A structure where the entrepreneur still owns the intellectual property but licenses it to the start-up company is disfavored by venture capitalists because license agreements can expire or be terminated, leaving the venture capitalist with a shell of a start-up company.

Generally, before a venture capitalist invests with a start-up company, it will conduct patent and trademark searches, seek the opinion of a patent counsel, and possibly ask third parties to confidentially evaluate the technology owned by the start-up company.

Additionally, the venture capitalist may ask key employees to sign non-competition agreements, where they agree not to start another company or join another company operating in the same sector as the start-up for a reasonable period of time. Key employees may also be asked to sign non-disclosure agreements because protecting a start-up company's proprietary technology is an essential element to success.

# Prior Operating History

Venture capitalists are not always the first investors in a start-up company. In fact, they may be the third source of financing for a company. Many start-up companies begin by seeking capital from friends, family members, and business associates. Next they may seek a so called "angel investor": a wealthy private individual or an institution that invests capital with the company but does not take an active role in managing or directing the strategy of the company. Then come the venture capitalists.

As a result, a start-up company may already have a prior history before presenting its business plan to a venture capitalist. At this stage, venture capitalists ensure that the start-up company does not have any unusual history such as a prior bankruptcy or failure.

The venture capitalist will also closely review the equity stakes that have been previously provided to family, friends, business associates, and angel investors. These equity stakes should be clearly identified in the business plan and any unusual provisions must be discussed. Equity interests can include common stock, preferred stock, convertible securities, rights, warrants, and stock options. There must still be sufficient equity and upside potential for the venture capitalist to invest. Finally, all prior security issues must be properly documented and must comply with applicable securities laws.

The venture capitalist will also check the company's articles of incorporation to determine whether it is in good legal standing in the state of incorporation. Further, the venture capitalist will examine the company's bylaws, and the minutes of any shareholder and board of directors meetings. The minutes of the meetings can indicate whether the company has a clear sense of direction or whether it is mired in indecision.

# The Start-up Management Team

The venture capitalist will closely review the resumes of every member of the management team. Academic backgrounds, professional work history, and references will all be checked. Most important to the venture capitalist will be the professional background of the management team. In particular, a management team that has successfully brought a previous start-up company to the IPO stage will be viewed most favorably.

In general, a great management team with a good business plan will be viewed more favorably than a good management team with a great business plan. The best business plan in the world can still fail from inability to execute. Therefore, a management team that has demonstrated a previous ability to follow and execute a business plan will be given a greater chance of success than an unproven management team with a great business opportunity.

However, this is where a venture capitalist can add value. Recognizing a great business opportunity but a weak management team, the venture capitalist can bring his or her expertise to the start-up company as well as bring in other, more seasoned management professionals. While this often creates some friction with the original entrepreneur, the ultimate goal is to make money. Egos often succumb when there is money to be made.

Last, the management team will need a seasoned chief financial officer (CFO). This will be the person primarily responsible for bringing the start-up company public. The CFO will work with the investment bankers to establish the price of the company's stock at the initial public offering. Since the IPO is often the exit strategy for the venture capitalist as well as some of the founders and key employees, it is critical that the CFO have IPO experience.

# Legal and Regulatory Issues

We have already touched on some of the legal issues regarding non-competition agreements, non-disclosure agreements, and proper filings for the issuance of equity and debt securities. In addition, the venture capitalist must also determine if patent protection is needed for the start-up's proprietary intellectual property, and if so, initiate the legal proceedings.

Also, in certain industries, federal regulatory approval is necessary before a product can be sold in the United States. Nowhere is this more important than the biotechnology and healthcare sectors. The business plan for the company must also address the time lag between product development and regulatory approval. Additionally, the venture capitalist must consider the time lag before operating profits will be achieved after regulatory approval of a new healthcare product.

Finally, there should be no litigation associated with the start-up company or its management team. Litigation takes time, money, and emotional wear and tear. It is can be a distraction for the company and its key employees. Outstanding or imminent litigation will raise the hurdle rate even higher before a venture capitalist will invest.

# Exit Plan

Eventually, the venture capitalist must liquidate her investment in the startup company to realize a gain for herself and her investors. When a venture capitalist reviews a business plan she will keep in mind the timing and probability of an exit strategy.

An exit strategy is another way the venture capitalist can add value beyond providing start-up financing. Venture capitalists often have many contacts with established operating companies. An established company may be willing to acquire the start-up company for its technology as part of a strategic expansion of its product line. Alternatively, venture capitalists maintain close ties with investment bankers. These bankers will be necessary if the start-up company decides to seek an IPO. In addition, a venture capitalist may ask other venture capitalists to invest in the startup company. This helps to spread the risk as well as provide additional sources of contacts with operating companies and investment bankers.

Venture capitalists almost always invest in the convertible preferred stock of the start-up company. There may be several rounds (or series) of financing of preferred stock before a start-up company goes public. Convertible preferred shares are the accepted manner of investment because these shares carry a priority over common stock in terms of dividends, voting rights, and liquidation preferences. Furthermore, venture capitalists have the option to convert their shares to common stock to enjoy the benefits of an IPO.

Other investment structures used by venture capitalists include convertible notes or debentures that provide for the conversion of the principal amount of the note or bond into either common or preferred shares at the option of the venture capitalist. Convertible notes and debentures may also be converted upon the occurrence of an event such as a merger, acquisition, or IPO. Venture capitalists may also be granted warrants to purchase the common equity of the start-up company as well as stock rights in the event of an IPO.

Other exit strategies used by venture capitalists are redemption rights and put options. Usually, these strategies are used as part of a company reorganization. Redemption rights and put options are generally not favored because they do not provide as large a rate of return as an acquisition or IPO. These strategies are often used as a last resort when there are no other viable alternatives. Redemption rights and put options are usually negotiated at the time the venture capitalist makes an investment in the start-up company (often called the Registration Rights Agreement).

Usually, venture capitalists require no less than the minimum return provided for in the liquidation preference of a preferred stock investment. Alternatively, the redemption rights or put option might be established by a common stock equivalent value that is usually determined by an investment banking appraisal. Last redemption rights or put option values may be based on a multiple of sales or earnings. Some redemption rights take the highest of all three valuation methods: the liquidation preference, the appraisal value, or the earnings/sales multiple.

In sum, there are many issues a venture capitalist must sort through before funding a start-up company. These issues range from identifying the business opportunity to sorting through legal and regulatory issues. Along the way, the venture capital must assess the quality of the management team, prior capital infusions, status of proprietary technology, operating history (if any) of the company, and timing and likelihood of an exit strategy.

# Venture Capital Investment Vehicles

As the interest for venture capital investments has increased, venture capitalists have responded with new vehicles for venture financing. These include limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and venture capital fund of funds.[2]

# Limited Partnerships

The predominant form of venture capital investing in the United States is the limited partnership. Venture capital funds operate either as "3(c)(1)" or "3(c)(7)" funds to avoid registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

As a limited partnership, all income and capital gains flow through the partnership to the limited partner investors. The partnership itself is not taxed. The appeal of the limited partnership vehicle has increased since 1996 with the "Check the Box" provision of the U.S. tax code.

Previously, limited partnerships had to meet several tests to determine if their predominant operating characteristics resembled more a partnership than a corporation. Such characteristics included, for instance, a limited term of existence. Failure to qualify as a limited partnership would mean double taxation for the investment fund; first at the fund level and second, at the investor level.

This changed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Services decision to let entities simply decide their own tax status by checking a box on their annual tax form as to whether they wished to be taxed as a corporation or as a partnership. "Checking the box" greatly encouraged investment funds to establish themselves as a limited partnership.

Limited partnerships are generally formed with an expected life of 7 to 10 years with an option to extend the limited partnership for another 1 to 5 years. The limited partnership is managed by a general partner who has day-to-day responsibility for managing the venture capital fund's investments as well as general liability for any lawsuits that may be brought against the fund. Limited partners, as their name implies, have only a limited (investor) role in the partnership. They do not partake in the management of the fund and they do not bear any liability beyond their committed capital.

All partners in the fund will commit to a specific investment amount at the formation of the limited partnership. However, the limited partners do not contribute money to the fund until it is called down or "taken down" by the general partner. Usually, the general partner will give one to two months notice of when it intends to make additional capital calls on the limited partners. Capital calls are made when the general partner has found a start-up company in which to invest. The general partner can make capital calls up to the amount of the limited partners' initial commitments.

An important element of limited partnership venture funds is that the general partner/venture capitalist has also committed investment capital to the fund. This assures the limited partners of an alignment of interests with the venture capitalist. Typically, limited partnership agreements specify a percentage or dollar amount of capital that the general partner must commit to the partnership.

# Limited Liability Companies

A recent phenomenon in the venture capital industry is the limited liability company (LLC). Similar to a limited partnership, all items of net income or loss as well as capital gains are passed through to the shareholders in the LLC. Also, like a limited partnership, an LLC must adhere to the safe harbors of the Investment Company Act of 1940. In addition,

LLCs usually have a life of 7 to 10 years with possible options to extend for another 1 to 5 years.

The managing director of an LLC acts like the general partner of a limited partnership. She has management responsibility for the LLC including the decision to invest in start-up companies the committed capital of the LLC's shareholders. The managing director of the LLC might itself be another LLC or a corporation. The same is true for limited partnerships; the general partner need not be an individual, it can be a legal entity like a corporation.

In sum, LLCs and limited partnerships accomplish the same goal—the pooling of investor capital into a central fund from which to make venture capital investments. The choice is dependent upon the type of investor sought. If the venture capitalist wishes to raise funds from a large number of passive and relatively uninformed investors, the limited partnership vehicle is the preferred venue. However, if the venture capitalist intends to raise capital from a small group of knowledgeable investors, the LLC is preferred.

The reason is twofold. First, LLCs usually have more specific shareholder rights and privileges. These privileges are best utilized with a small group of well-informed investors. Second, an LLC structure provides shareholders with control over the sale of additional shares in the LLC to new shareholders. This provides the shareholders with more power with respect to the twin issues of increasing the LLC's pool of committed capital and from whom that capital will be committed.

# Venture Capital Fund of Funds

A venture capital fund of funds is a venture pool of capital that, instead of investing directly in start-up companies, invests in other venture capital funds. The venture capital fund of funds is a relatively new phenomenon in the venture capital industry. The general partner of a fund of funds does not select start-up companies in which to invest. Instead, she selects the best venture capitalists with the expectation that they will find appropriate start-up companies to fund.

A venture capital fund of funds offers several advantages to investors. First, the investor receives broad exposure to a diverse range of venture capitalists, and in turn, a wide range of start-up investing. Second, the investor receives the expertise of the fund of funds manager in selecting the best venture capitalists with whom to invest money. Last, a fund of funds may have better access to popular, well-funded venture capitalists whose funds may be closed to individual investors. In return for these benefits, investors pay a management fee (and, in some cases, an incentive fee) to the fund of funds manager. The management fee can range from  $0.5\%$  to  $2\%$  of the net assets managed.

Fund of fund investing also offers benefits to the venture capitalists. First, the venture capitalist receives one large investment (from the venture fund of funds) instead of several small investments. This makes fund raising and investor administration more efficient. Second, the venture capitalist interfaces with an experienced fund of funds manager instead of several (potentially inexperienced) investors.

# Specialization within the Venture Capital Industry

Like any industry that grows and matures, expansion and maturity lead to specialization. The trend towards specialization in the venture capital industry exists on several levels, by industry, geography, stage of financing, and "special situations." Specialization is the natural by-product of two factors. First, the enormous amount of capital flowing into venture capital funds has encouraged venture capitalists to distinguish themselves from other funds by narrowing their investment focus. Second, the development of many new technologies over the past decade has encouraged venture capitalists to specialize in order to invest most profitably.

# Specialization by Industry

Specialization by entrepreneurs is another reason why venture capitalists have tailored their investment domain. Just as entrepreneurs have become more focused in their start-up companies, venture capitalists have followed suit. The biotechnology industry is a good example. Specialized start-up biotech firms have led to specialized venture capital firms.

# Specialization by Geography

With the boom in technology companies in Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, and Seattle, it is not surprising to find that many California based venture capital firms concentrate their investments on the west coast of the United States. Not only are there plenty of investment opportunities in this region, it is also easier for the venture capital firms to monitor their investments locally. The same is true for other technology centers in New York, Boston, and Texas.

Regional specialization has the advantage of easier monitoring of invested capital. Also, larger venture capital firms may overlook viable start-up opportunities located in more remote sections of the United States. Regional venture capitalists step in to fill this niche.

The downside of regional specialization is twofold. First, regional concentration may not provide sufficient diversification to a venture capital portfolio. Second, a start-up company in a less-exposed geographic region may have greater difficulty in attracting additional rounds of ven true capital financing. This may limit the start-up company's growth potential as well as exit opportunities for the regional venture capitalist.

# Stage of Financing

Venture capitalists also distinguish themselves by the point at which they will invest in a start-up company. Some venture capitalists provide first stage, or "seed capital" while others wait to invest in companies that are further along in their development. For a first time entrepreneur, seed financing can be difficult to find. Without a prior track record, most venture capitalists are skeptical of new product ideas.

Seed financing is usually in the range of  $500,000 to$ 3 million. First stage venture capitalists tend to be smaller firms because large venture capital firms cannot afford to spend the endless hours with an entrepreneur for a small investment, usually no greater than $1 to $2 million.

A new development to fill this niche is the venture capital "feeder fund." These have been established where large venture capitalists provide capital to seed venture capitalists in return for the opportunity to make a later stage investment in the start-up company if it is successful.

Most venture capital firms invest either in mid or late stage rounds of equity. Later stage financing provides for a quicker return of capital as well as a lower risk investment. Returns are expected to be lower than that for seed financing. In many cases the start-up company has a viable product by the time a second or third round of venture financing is sought. Also, with the increase flow of money into venture funds, venture capitalists have found that they have larger pools of capital to deploy. Later stage financing provides the most efficacious means to deploy large chunks of investor capital.

# Special Situation Venture Capital

In any industry, there are always failures. Not every start-up company makes it to the IPO stage. However, this opens another specialized niche in the venture capital industry: the turnaround venture deal. Turnaround deals are as risky as seed financing because the start-up company may be facing pressure from creditors. The turnaround venture capitalist exists because mainstream venture capitalists may not be sufficiently well-versed in restructuring a turnaround situation.

In summary, the growth of the venture capital industry has created the need for venture capital specialists. The range of new business opportunities is now so diverse that it is simply not possible for a single venture capital firm to stay on top of all opportunities in all industries. Therefore, by necessity, venture capitalists have narrowed their investment domain to concentrate on certain niches within the start-up universe. Specialization also leads to differentiation, which allows venture capitalists to distinguish themselves from other investment funds.

# LEVERAGED BUYOUTS

Leveraged buyouts are a way to take a company with publicly traded stock private, or a way to put a company in the hands of the current management (sometimes referred to management buyouts or MBOs). LBOs use the assets or cash flows of the company to secure debt financing either in bonds issued by the corporation or bank loans, to purchase the outstanding equity of the company. In either case, control of the company is concentrated in the hands of the LBO firm and management, and there is no public stock outstanding.

LBOs represent a mechanism to take advantage of a window of opportunity to increase the value of a corporation. Leverage buyouts can be a way to unlock hidden value or exploit existing but underfunded opportunities.

# A Theoretical Example of a Leveraged Buyout

In a perfect world, everyone makes money, and no one is unhappy. We will discuss some spectacular LBO failures below. In the meantime, we describe how a theoretical LBO should work.

Imagine a company that is capitalized with a market value of equity of  $500 million and a face value of debt of$ 100 million. The company generates an EBITDA (earnings before interest and taxes plus depreciation and amortization) of $80 million. EBITDA represents the free cash flow from operations that is available for the owners and debtors of the company. This is a 13.3\% return on capital for the company's shareholders and debtholders.

An LBO firm offers  $700 million to purchase the equity of the company and to pay off the outstanding debt. The debt is paid off at face value of$ 100 million and $600 million is offered to the equity holders (a 20\% premium over the market value) to entice them to tender their shares to the LBO offer.

The  $700 million LBO is financed with$ 600 million in debt (with a 10\% coupon rate) and $100 million in equity. The company must pay yearly debt service of $60 million to meet its interest payment obligations. After the LBO, the management of the company improves its operations, streamlines its expenses, and implements better asset utilization. The result is that the cash flow of the company improves from $80 million a year to  $120 million a year.$  By foregoing dividends and using the free cash flow to pay down the existing debt, the management of the company can own the company free and clear in about seven years.

This means that, after seven years, the LBO firm can claim the annual cash flow of 120 million completely for itself. Using a growth rate of 2\% per year and a discount rate of 12\%, this cash flow is worth:

$$
\$ 120 \text {m i l l o n} / (0. 1 2 - 0. 0 2) = \$ 1. 2 \text {b i l l o n}
$$

Therefore, the total return on the investment for the LBO transaction is:

$$
[ \$ 1.2 billion / \$ 100 million ] ^ {1/2} - 1 = 42.6 \%
$$

The amount of  $42.6\%$  represents the annual compounded return for this investment.

As this example demonstrates, the returns to LBO transactions can be quite large, but the holding period may also be commensurately long. At the end of seven years, the management of the company can reap the $1.2 billion value through one of four methods:

1. The management can sell the company to a competitor or another company that wishes to expand into the industry.
 2. Through an initial public offering. Consider the example of Gibson Greetings. This company was purchased from RCA for $81 million with all but $1 million financed by bank loans and real estate leasebacks. When Gibson Greetings went public, the 50\% equity interest owned by the LBO firm was worth about $140 million, equal to a compound annual rate of return of over 200\%.
3. Another LBO. The management of the company doubled its value from  $600 million to$ 1.2 billion. They can now refinance the company in another LBO deal where debt is reintroduced into the company to compensate management for their equity stake. In fact, the existing management may even remain as the operators of the company with an existing stake in the second LBO transaction, providing them with the opportunity for a second go round of leveraged equity appreciation.
4. Straight refinancing. This is similar to number 3 above, where a company reintroduces debt into its balance sheet to pay out a large cash dividend to its equity owners.

# How LBOs Create Value

The theoretical example given above is a good starting point for describing an LBO transaction, but there is no standard format for a buyout, each company is different, and every LBO deal has different motivations. However, there are five general categories of LBOs that illuminate how these transactions can create value.

# LBOs that Improve Operating Efficiency

A company may be bought out because it is shackled with a non-competitive operating structure. For large public companies with widespread equity ownership, the separation of ownership and management can create agency problems with ineffective control mechanisms. Management may have little incentive to create value because it has a small stake in the company, and monitoring of management's actions by a diverse shareholder base is likely to be just as minimal.

Under these circumstances, management is likely to be compensated based on revenue growth. This may result in excess expansion and operating inefficiencies resulting from too much growth. Safeway Corporation is an example where value creation came not from entrepreneurial input, but rather from greater operating efficiencies.

# Unlocking an Entrepreneurial Mindset

Another way an LBO can create value is by helping to free management to concentrate on innovations. Another frequent LBO strategy is the unwanted division. Often an operating division of a conglomerate is chained to its parent company and does not have sufficient freedom to implement its business plan. An LBO can free the operating division as a new company, able to control its own destiny. Duracell Corporation which was taken private in 1988 is an excellent example of an entrepreneurial LBO.

# The Overstuffed Corporation

One of the mainstream targets of many LBO firms are conglomerates. Conglomerate corporations consist of many different operating divisions or subsidiaries, often in completely different industries. Wall Street analysts are often reluctant to follow or "cover" conglomerates because they do not fit neatly into any one industrial category. As a result, these companies can be misunderstood by the investing public, and therefore, undervalued. Beatrice Foods (a food processing conglomerate) LBO in 1986 purchased for $6.2 billion is an example.

# Buy and Build Strategies

Another LBO value creation strategy involves combining several operating companies or divisions through additional buyouts. The LBO firm begins with one buyout and then acquires more companies and divisions that are strategically aligned with the initial LBO portfolio company. The strategy is that there will be synergies from combining several different companies into one. In some respects, this strategy is the reverse of that for conglomerates. Rather than strip a conglomerate down to its most profitable divisions, this strategy pursues a "buy and build" approach. This type of strategy is also known as a "leveraged build-up."

# LBO Turnaround Strategies

With a slowdown in the United States as well as global economies throughout 2000, turnaround LBOs have become increasingly popular. Unlike traditional buyout firms that look for successful, mature companies with low debt to equity ratios and stable management, turnaround LBO funds look for underperforming companies with excessive leverage and poor management. The targets for turnaround LBO specialists come from two primary sources: (1) ailing companies on the brink of Chapter 11 bankruptcy and (2) underperforming companies in another LBO fund's portfolio.

# LBO Fund Structures

In this section we discuss how LBO funds are structured as well as discuss their fees. While LBO funds are very similar to venture capital funds in design, they are much more creative in fee generation.

# Fund Design

Almost all LBO funds are designed as limited partnerships. This is very similar to the way hedge funds and venture capital funds are established. In fact many LBO funds have the name "partners" in their title.

Every LBO fund is run by a general partner. The general partner is typically the LBO firm, and all investment discretion as well as day to day operations vest with the general partner. Limited partners, as their name applies, have a very limited role in the management of the LBO fund. For the most part, limited partners are passive investors who rely on the general partner to source, analyze, perform due diligence, and invest the committed capital of the fund.

Some LBO funds have advisory boards comprised of the general partner and a select group of limited partners. The duties of the advisory board are to advise the general partner on conflicts of issue that may arise as a result of acquiring a portfolio company or collecting fees, provide input as to when it might be judicious to seek independent valuations of the LBO fund's portfolio companies, and to discuss whether dividend payments for portfolio companies should be in cash or securities.

# Fees

If there was ever an investment structure that could have its cake and eat it too, it would be an LBO firm. LBO firms have any number of ways to make their money.

First, consider how LBO firms gather capital. KKR for instance, received in 2000 a  $1 billion capital contribution from the State of Oregon pension fund for its newest LBO fund, the Millennium Fund. LBO firms charge a management fee for the capital committed to their investment funds. The management fee generally ranges from 1\%$  to  $3\%$  depending on the strength of the LBO firm. On KKR's newest fund, for instance, the management fee offered to some investors is  $1\%$  per year. Given that KKR expects to raise between 5 billion and $6 billion, this would indicate an annual management fee in the range of $50 to $60 million a year.

In addition, LBO firms share in the profits of the investment pool. These incentive fees usually range from  $20\%$  to  $30\%$ . Incentive fees are profit sharing fees. For instance, an incentive fee of  $20\%$  means that the LBO firm keeps one dollar out of every five earned on LBO transactions.

LBO firms also may charge fees to the corporation that it is taken private of up to  $1\%$  of the total selling price for arranging and negotiating the transaction. As an example, KKR earned  $75 million for arranging the buyout of RJR Nabisco, and$ 60 million for arranging the buyout of Safeway Stores.

Not only do LBO firms earn fees for arranging deals, they can earn break-up fees if a deal craters. Consider the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette LBO of IBP Inc. This  $3.8 billion buyout deal, first announced in October, 2000 was subsequently topped by a$ 4.1 billion takeover bid from Smithfield Foods Inc. in November, 2000. This bid was in turn topped by a $4.3 billion takeover bid from Tyson Foods Inc. in December 2000. Despite losing out on the buyout of IBP, as part of the LBO deal terms, DLJ was due a $66.5 million breakup fee from IBP because it was sold to another bidder.

In addition to earning fees for arranging the buyout of a company or for losing a buyout bid, LBO firms may also charge a divestiture fee for arranging the sale of a division of a private company after the buyout has been completed. Further, a LBO firm may charge director's fees to a buyout company if managing partners of the LBO firm sit on the company's board of directors after the buyout has occurred. In fact there are any number of ways for a LBO firm to make money on a buyout transaction.

# RISKS OF LBOs

LBOs have less risk than venture capital deals for several reasons. First, the target corporation is already a seasoned company with public equity outstanding. Indeed, many LBO targets are mature companies with undervalued assets.

Second, the management of the company has an established track record. Therefore, assessment of the key employees is easier than a new team in a venture capital deal.

Third, the LBO target usually has established products or services and a history of earning profits. However, management of the company may not have the freedom to fully pursue their initiatives. An LBO transaction can provide this freedom.

Last, the exit strategy of a new IPO in several years time is much more feasible than a venture capital deal because the company already had publicly traded stock outstanding. A prior history as a public company, demonstrable operating profits, and a proven management team make an IPO for a buyout firm much more feasible than an IPO for a start-up venture.

The obvious risk of LBO transactions is the extreme leverage used. This will leave the company with a high debt to equity ratio and a very large debt service. The high leverage can provide large gains for the equity owners, but it also leaves the margin for error very small. If the company cannot generate enough cash flow to service the coupon and interest payments demanded of its bondholders, it may end up in bankruptcy, with little left over for its equity investors. "Leveraged Fallouts" are an inevitable fact of life in the LBO marketplace.

# DEBT AS PRIVATE EQUITY

In this section we discuss two forms of private equity that appear as debt on an issuer's balance sheet. Mezzanine debt is closely linked to the leveraged buyout market, while distressed debt investors pursue companies whose fortunes have taken a turn for the worse. Like venture capital and LBOs, these strategies pursue long-only investing in the securities of target companies, and these strategies can result in a significant equity stake in a target company. In addition, like venture capital and LBOs, these two forms of private equity investing provide alternative investment strategies within the equity asset class.

Since mezzanine debt and distressed debt investors purchase the bonds of a target company, it may seem inappropriate to classify these strategies within the equity asset class. However, we will demonstrate in this chapter that these two strategies derive a considerable amount of return as equity components within a company's balance sheet.

For now, it is important to recognize that mezzanine debt and distressed debt investing can be distinguished from traditional long-only investing. The reason is that these two forms of private equity attempt to capture investment returns from economic sources that are mostly independent of the economy's long-term macroeconomic growth. For instance, the debt of a bankrupt company is more likely to rise and fall with the fortunes of the company and negotiations with other creditors than with the direction of the general stock market. While the direction of the stock market and the health of the overall economy may have some influence on a distressed company, it is more likely that the fortunes of the company will be determined by the hands of its creditors.

# Mezzanine Debt

Mezzanine debt is often hard to classify because the distinction between debt and equity can blur at this level of financing. Oftentimes, mezzanine debt represents a hybrid, a combination of debt of equity. Mezzanine financing gets its name because it is inserted into a company's capital structure between the "floor" of equity and the "ceiling" of senior, secured debt. It is from the in between nature of this type of debt that mezzanine derives its name.

Mezzanine financing is not used to provide cash for the day-to-day operations of a company. Instead, it is used during transitional periods in a company's life. Frequently, a company is in a situation where its senior creditors (banks) are unwilling to provide any additional capital and the company does not wish to issue additional stock. Mezzanine financing can fill this void.

# Mezzanine Financing to Bridge a Gap in Time

Mezzanine financing has three general purposes. First, it can be financing used to bridge a gap in time. This might be a round of financing to get a private company to the IPO stage. In this case, mezzanine financing can either be subordinated debt convertible into equity, or preferred shares, convertible into common equity upon the completion of a successful IPO.

Examples of this time-gap financing include Extricity, Inc. a platform provider for business-to-business relationship management. In May 2000, Extricity raised $50 million in mezzanine financing from a broad group of corporate and financial investors. Within a matter of days after its mezzanine round, Extricity also filed a registration statement for an IPO, but subsequently withdrew its registration statement as the market for IPOs cooled off. However, the mezzanine round of financing was sufficient to get Extricity through the next 10 months until March 2001, when the company was purchased for $168 million by Peregrine Systems Inc., a business-software maker.

# Mezzanine Financing to Bridge a Gap in the Capital Structure

A second and more common use of mezzanine financing is to bridge a gap in the capital structure of a company. In this case, mezzanine financing is used not because of time constraints but rather because of financing constraints between senior debt and equity. Mezzanine financing provides the layer of capital beyond what secured lenders are willing to provide while minimizing the dilution of a company's outstanding equity.

Mezzanine debt is used to fill the gap between senior debt represented by bank loans, mortgages and senior bonds, and equity. Consequently, mezzanine debt is junior, or subordinated, to the debt of the bank loans, and is typically the last component of debt to be retired.

Under this definition, mezzanine financing is used to fund acquisitions, corporate re-capitalizations, or production growth. More generally, mezzanine financing is used whenever the equity component of a transaction is too low to attract senior lenders such as banks and insurance companies. Senior lenders may require a lower debt-to-equity ratio than the borrower is willing to provide. Most borrowers dislike reducing their equity share price through offerings that dilute equity ownership.

# Mezzanine Financing to Bridge a Gap in an LBO

The third popular use of mezzanine debt is a tranche of financing in many LBO deals. For instance, LBO target companies may not have the ability to access the bond markets right away, particularly if the target company was an operating division of a larger entity. It may not have a separate financial history to satisfy SEC requirements for a public sale of its bonds. Consequently, a mezzanine tranche may be necessary to complete the financing of the buyout deal. Alternatively, a buyout candidate may not have enough physical assets to provide the necessary collateral in a buyout transaction. Last, bank lenders may be hesitant to lend if there is not sufficient equity committed to the transaction. Mezzanine debt is often the solution to solve these LBO financing problems.

# Mezzanine Funds

Mezzanine funds must pay attention to the same securities laws as hedge funds, venture capital funds, and buyout funds. This means that mezzanine funds must ensure that they fall within either the 3(c)(1) or the 3(c)(7) exemptions of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These "safe harbor" provisions ensure that mezzanine funds do not have to adhere to the filing, disclosure, record keeping, and reporting requirements as do mutual funds.

There are two key distinctions between venture capital funds and mezzanine funds. The first is the return expectations. Mezzanine funds seek total rates of return in the  $15\%$  to low twenties range. Compare this to LBO funds that seek returns in the mid-to-high twenties and venture capital funds that seek returns in excess of  $30\%$ .

For example, senior bank debt in a private equity transaction is usually priced at 200 to 250 basis points over LIBOR, while mezzanine financing usually bears a coupon rate of 400 to 500 basis points over Libor. In addition, mezzanine financing will contain some form of equity appreciation such as warrants or the ability to convert into common stock that raises the total return towards  $20\%$ .

Mezzanine financing is the most expensive form of debt because it is the last to be repaid. It ranks at the bottom of the creditor totem pole, just above equity. As a result, it is expected to earn a rate of return only slightly less than common equity.

Second, mezzanine funds are staffed with different expertise than a venture capital fund. Most venture capital funds have staff with heavy technology related experience including former senior executives of software, semiconductor, and Internet companies. In contrast, mezzanine funds tend to have financial professionals, experienced in negotiating "equity kickers" to be added on to the mezzanine debt offering.

Mezzanine funds have not attracted the flow of investor capital compared to venture capital funds or leveraged buyout funds. Part of the reason is that with a robust economy throughout most of the 1990s, mezzanine debt was not a necessary component of many transactions. Second, mezzanine financing tends to be small, generally in the  $20 million to$ 300 million range. Last, mezzanine debt, while it yields greater returns than junk bonds, cannot compete with the returns earned by venture capitalists and leveraged buyout funds.

Mezzanine funds look for businesses that have a high potential for growth and earnings, but do not have a sufficient cash flow to receive full funding from banks or other senior creditors. Banks may be unwilling to lend because of a short operating history or a high debt to equity ratio. Mezzanine funds look for companies that, over the next 4 to 7 years, can repay the mezzanine debt through a debt refinancing, an initial public offering, or an acquisition.

Mezzanine funds are risk lenders. This means that in a liquidation of the company, mezzanine investors expect little or no recovery of their principal. Consequently, mezzanine investors must assess investment opportunities outside of conventional banking parameters. Existing collateral and short-term cash flow are less of a consideration. Instead, mezzanine investors carefully review the management team and its business plan to assess the likelihood that future growth will be achieved by the issuing company. In sum, similar to stockholders, mezzanine debt investors assume the risk of the company's success or failure.

Investors in mezzanine funds are generally pension funds, endowments, and foundations. These investors do not have the internal infrastructure or expertise to invest directly in the mezzanine market. Therefore, they enter this alternative investment strategy as limited partners through a mezzanine fund.

Similar to hedge funds, venture capital funds and LBO funds, mezzanine funds are managed by a general partner who has full investment discretion. Many mezzanine funds are managed by merchant banks who have experience with gap financing or by mezzanine professionals who previously worked in the mezzanine departments of insurance companies and banks.

# Advantages of Mezzanine Debt to the Investor

Mezzanine debt is a hybrid. It has debt-like components but usually provides for some form of equity appreciation. This appeals to investors who are more conservative but like to have some spice in their portfolios.

High Equity-Like Returns The high returns to mezzanine debt compared to senior debt appeals to traditional fixed income investors such as insurance companies. Mezzanine debt typically has a coupon rate that is 200 basis points over that of senior secured debt. Additionally, given an insurance company's long-term investment horizon, it may be less concerned with short-term earnings fluctuations.

Further, mezzanine debt often has an equity kicker, typically in the form of warrants. These warrants may have a strike price as low as 0.01 per share. The amount of warrants included is inversely proportional to the coupon rate. The higher the coupon rate, the fewer the warrants that need to be issued.

Nonetheless, the investor receives both a high coupon payment plus participation in the upside of the company should it achieve its growth potential. The equity component can be significant, representing up to  $5\%$  to  $20\%$  of the outstanding equity of the company. For this reason, mezzanine debt is often viewed as an investment in the company as opposed to a lien on assets.

Priority of Payment Although mezzanine debt is generally not secured by collateral, it still ranks higher than equity and other unsecured creditors. Therefore, mezzanine debt is senior to trade creditors.

Schedule of Repayment Like senior secured debt, mezzanine debt usually has a repayment schedule. This schedule may not start for several years as senior debt is paid off, but it provides the certainty of when a return of capital is expected.

Board Representation A subordinated lender generally expects to be considered an equity partner. In some cases, mezzanine lenders may request board observation rights. However, in other cases, the mezzanine lender may take a seat on the board of directors with full voting rights.

Restrictions on the Borrower Although mezzanine debt is typically unsecured, it still may come with restrictions on the borrower. The mezzanine lender may have the right to approve or disapprove of additional debt, acquisitions made by the borrower, changes in the management team, and the payment of dividends.

# Distressed Debt

Distressed debt investing is the practice of purchasing the debt of troubled companies. These companies may have already defaulted on their debt or may be on the brink of default. Additionally, distressed debt may be that of a company seeking bankruptcy protection.

The key to distressed debt investing is to recognize that the term "distressed" has two meanings. First, it means that the issuer of the debt is troubled—its liabilities may exceed its assets—or it may be unable to meet its debt service and interest payments as they become due. Therefore, distressed debt investing almost always means that some workout, turnaround, or bankruptcy solution must be implemented for the bonds to appreciate in value.

Second, "distressed" refers to the price of the bonds. Distressed debt often trades for pennies on the dollar. This affords a savvy investor the opportunity to make a killing if she can identify a company with a viable business plan but a short-term cash flow problem.

# Vulture Investors and Hedge Fund Managers

Distressed debt investors are often referred to as "vulture investors," or just "vultures" because they pick the bones of under performing companies. They buy the debt of troubled companies including subordinated debt, junk bonds, bank loans, and obligations to suppliers. Their investment plan is to buy the distressed debt at a fraction of its face value and then seek improvement of the company.

Sometimes this debt is used as a way to gain an equity investment stake in the company as the vultures agree to forgive the debt they own in return for stock in the company. Other times, the vultures may help the troubled company to get on its feet, thus earning a significant return as the value of their distressed debt recovers in value. Still other times distressed debt buyers help impatient creditors to cut their losses and wipe a bad debt off their books. The vulture in return waits patiently for the company to correct itself and for the value of the distressed debt to recover.

There is no standard model for distressed debt investing, each distressed situation requires a unique approach and solution. As a result, distressed debt investing is mostly company selection. There is a low covariance with the general stock market.

The returns for distressed debt investing can be very rewarding. Distressed debt obligations generally trade at levels that yield a total return of  $20\%$  or higher. For example, by the beginning of 2001 an estimated  $15\%$  to  $20\%$  of all leveraged bank debt loans traded at 80 cents on the dollar or less.[5]

# Distressed Debt and Bankruptcy

Distressed debt investing and the bankruptcy process are inextricably intertwined. Many distressed debt investors purchase the debt while the borrowing company is currently in the throws of bankruptcy. Other investors purchase the debt before a company enters into bankruptcy proceedings with the expectation of gaining control of the company.

# Using Distressed Debt to Recycle Private Equity

LBO firms are a great source for distressed debt. "Leveraged fallouts" occur frequently, leaving large amounts of distressed debt in their wake. However, this provides an opportunity for distressed debt buyers to jump in, purchase cheaply non-performing bank loans and subordinated debt, eliminate the prior private equity investors, and assert their own private equity ownership.

# Distressed Buyouts

Even as leveraged buyout firms create distress situations, they also actively invest in this arena. After all, bankruptcy court and creditor workouts provide opportunities to purchase undervalued assets. Often, creditors are sufficiently worried about receiving any recovery that they bail out of their positions when possible, opening up the door for buyout firms to scoop up assets on the cheap.

# Converting Distressed Debt to Private Equity in a Pre-Packaged Bankruptcy

In February 2001, Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corp., the largest publicly traded U.S. movie theater chain, and one of the largest movie theater chains in the world, filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. At the same time, it signed a letter of intent with Oaktree Capital Management, LLC and the Onex Corporation to sell Loews Cineplex and its subsidiaries to the investor group. This was a "pre-packaged" bankruptcy where the debtor agrees in advance to a plan of reorganization before formerly filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.

The letter agreement proposed that Onex and Oaktree convert their distressed debt holdings of about  $250 million of senior secured bank debt and$ 180 million of unsecured company bonds into 88\% of the equity of the reorganized company. Unsecured creditors, including subordinated debtholders, would receive the other 12\% of equity. All existing equity interests would be wiped out by the reorganization. Last, the remaining holders of bank debt would receive new term loans as part of the bankruptcy process equal in recovery to about 98\% of the face amount of current debt.

In this prepackaged example, Onex and Oaktree became the majority equity owners of Loews by purchasing its bank and subordinated debt. Furthermore, their bank debt was converted to a private equity stake because all public shares of Loews were wiped out through the bankruptcy proceedings. Loews two largest shareholders, Sony Corporation (40\% equity ownership) and Vivendi Universal SA (26\%) lost their complete equity stake in Loews. In effect, the bankruptcy proceeding transformed Loews from a public company to a private one.

# Distressed Debt as an Undervalued Security

Distressed debt is not always an entree into private equity; it can simply be an investment in an undervalued security. In this instance, distressed debt investors are less concerned with an equity stake in the troubled company. Instead, they expect to benefit if the company can implement a successful turnaround strategy.

# Distressed Debt Arbitrage

If there is any way to skin an arbitrage, hedge fund managers will think of it. While this is not a private equity form of investing, it is a form of equity arbitrage best suited for hedge fund managers.

The arbitrage is constructed as follows. A hedge fund manager purchases distressed debt which she believes is undervalued. At the same time, she shorts the company's underlying stock. The idea is that if the bonds are going to decline in value, the company's stock price will decline even more dramatically because equity holders have only a residual claim behind debtholders.

Conversely, if the company's prospects improve, both the distressed debt and equity will appreciate significantly. The difference then will be between the coupon payment on the debt versus dividends paid on the stock. Since a company coming out of a workout or turnaround situation almost always conserves its cash and does not pay cash stock dividends, the hedge fund manager should earn large interest payments on the debt compared to the equity.

# Risks of Distressed Debt Investing

There are two main risks associated with distressed debt investing. First, business risk still applies. Just because distressed debt investors can purchase the debt of a company on the cheap does not mean it cannot go lower. This is the greatest risk to distressed debt investing, a troubled company may be worthless and unable to pay off its creditors. While creditors often convert their debt into equity, the company may not be viable as a going concern. If the company cannot develop a successful plan of reorganization, it will only continue its spiral downwards.

It may seem strange, but creditworthiness doesn't apply. The reason is that the debt is already distressed because the company may already be in default and its debt thoroughly discounted. Consequently, failure to pay interest and debt service has already occurred.

Instead, vulture investors consider the business risks of the company. They are concerned not with the short-term payment of interest and debt service, but rather, the ability of the company to execute a viable business plan. From this perspective, it can be said that distressed debt investors are truly equity investors. They view the purchase of distressed debt as an investment in the company as opposed to a lending facility.

The second main risk is the lack of liquidity. The distressed debt arena is a fragmented market, dominated by a few players. Trading out of a distressed debt position may mean selling at a significant discount to the book value of the debt.

In addition, purchasers of distressed debt must have long-term investment horizons. Workout and turnaround situations do not happen overnight. It may be several years before a troubled company can correct its course and appreciate in value.

This chapter covers the real estate asset class. It focuses on the investment and capital market aspects (the supply of and demand for the investment) and not on the space market aspect (the supply of and demand for space to lease) of real estate. Real estate comprises one-third of the value of global capital assets and represents approximately $10 trillion of value in the United States alone. Of this $10 trillion, approximately $3 to $4 trillion falls into the category of commercial and multifamily investment-grade real estate, which excludes farmland, timber, raw land, hotels, and owner-occupied residential real estate. Hotels, farmland, timber, and raw land are sometimes included and sometimes excluded from institutional investors' definition of real estate, but for simplicity they are not discussed in this chapter. Owner-occupied residential real estate is a separately studied class of investment.

The commercial and rental residential real estate property types covered are as follows:

Office buildings, such as central business district assets, suburban buildings, office parks, and offices attached to mixed-use projects.

Retail centers, including malls, strip centers, big box retail, high street retail, neighborhood centers, and factory outlet projects.

■ Industrial projects, including both individual buildings and those located in industrial parks, and industrial buildings of all sizes and ceiling clear heights.

- Apartment complexes located in the inner city, suburban garden style units, high-rise high end urban projects, tax exempt buildings, and condominiums converted to rental units.

Real estate investments are characterized by the following structures:

■ Private commercial real estate equity , held as individual assets or in commingled vehicles.

Private commercial real estate debt, held as either directly issued whole loans or commercial mortgages held in funds and/or commingled vehicles.

■ Public real estate equity structured as REITs or real estate operating companies (REOCs).

■ Public commercial real estate debt structured as commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).

These structures represent the quadrants of the modern real estate investment universe. Exhibit 27.1 shows the approximate value and percentage shares of each quadrant through time. Clearly the real estate investment universe has changed appreciably over the past 20 years. In the past, the private debt and equity markets dominated the real estate investment universe. While public equity had long played a small role in the real estate capitalization structure, the role has grown sharply since the early 1990s when many distressed private owners of real estate turned to the public markets to recapitalize and thereby save their companies from extreme capital shortfalls. Real estate debt markets also turned to the public markets for capital and so the commercial mortgage-backed securities industry developed.

Debt and equity and public and private markets are all covered in the chapter on real estate because while the traditional definition of real estate was limited to private equity, this definition has given way to a more modern and appropriate definition. Prior to the early 1990s, the public debt and equity markets were not of significant size and the private debt market was the province of a handful of the largest insurance companies and, therefore was not routinely considered accessible to an institutional investor.

# TWO Distinguishing CHARACTERISTICS OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS

Real estate has two unique characteristics that materially influence its risk and return behaviors. Real estate is a hybrid asset with differing degrees of debt-oriented and equity-oriented investment behaviors and real estate values rarely fall to zero and stay at that level. Each of these distinguishing characteristics is developed below.

# Real Estate is a Debt/Equity Hybrid

A mix of debt-like and equity-like behaviors drives every real estate investment's performance. For example, consider the extreme case of a building leased in its entirety on a long-term triple net lease to a credit tenant. The contractually bound fixed-lease payments to the building's owner are analogous to the payments to a bondholder and are not similar in character to the payments to an equity investor. The value of this asset varies in step with the same types of influences to which a mortgage holder or a bondholder is subject; interest rate movements, inflation, and the creditworthiness of the tenant. At the other extreme, the value of a totally vacant building is tied to conditions in the space and capital markets and not nearly as influenced by interest rates and, of course, is not influenced at all by tenant credit. There are no cash flows to equate to bond flows. As the building becomes leased it evolves from pure equity to a debt-equity hybrid, with some of the influences on value elicited from the debt markets and others from the equity markets. If the building is ultimately leased to long-term credit tenants then it becomes more debt-like than equity-like. On the other hand, if the triple net lease building loses its tenant, then it very quickly reverts to a pure equity investment. Equityoriented value generators like the demand for and the supply of space, local market economic health, the building's location, and other building-specific attributes increase in their influence on value and on volatility, and, therefore, on the investment characteristics of the asset.

Commercial mortgages also exhibit this equity-like and debt-like convolution of behaviors. The creditworthiness of a building that is the collateral underlying a mortgage is dependent upon the lease structure as described above. This creditworthiness can shift on a dime under some conditions. Most commercial mortgages are non-recourse to the borrower, but are recourse to the asset. Thus there are times when a foreclosed mortgage becomes an unintentional (or, as a deliberate strategy, an intentional) equity holding. A CMBS issue is generally comprised of a pool of mortgages, placed on underlying real estate collateral. The cash flows from the mortgages are then carved up to produce high-grade bond cash flows and low-grade or unrated equity-like cash flows from the most subordinated pieces. The tranches between the top and bottom tranches are characterized by varying degrees of equity-like and debt-like behaviors driven largely by the nature of the underlying collateral.

# Real Estate Values Rarely Disappear

The second most important characteristic of real estate investments is that the asset is highly likely to have residual value no matter what kind of battering it may have suffered in the space and capital markets. All types of investments in real estate are ultimately grounded upon a physical asset. Real estate is not an "idea" for a business, nor is it a business that is dependent upon the employment of specific people—without whom the enterprise is valueless. Instead, a building is a physical structure that can probably be put to some use in some way over some period of time. This means that only in the rarest of circumstances does the value of an asset go to zero and stay there. This reality alone puts real estate and all of its variants in a distinct class.

# Using the Debt-Equity Mix

Given the definition of real estate as a debt-equity hybrid, it only makes sense for the real estate investor to consider real estate an asset for which the debt and equity components can be purposefully weighted to suit the investor's needs. Investors increasingly use all of the quadrants to create a debt-equity mix that exposes them to the influences to which they most wish to be exposed and protects them from undesirable influences. As well, real estate investors can use the public and private trading market to execute arbitrage strategies and to manage liquidity and transactions costs.

# THE NATURE OF THE INVESTORS

Who holds these real estate investments? The lion's share of the market has been, and continues to be, controlled by life insurance companies, banks, and private investors. Although the life company holdings as a percent of the total have declined significantly because some have gone public and wanted to purge their asset bases of the less well understood and valued holdings, and also because many experienced a tough cycle in the early 1990s. It is interesting that even in the face of that tough cycle, banks have held their relative position, as have pension funds and private investors. While pension funds look like real players at a  $10\%$  share of the institutional real estate market, in fact the portion of the average pension fund portfolio that is comprised of commercial and multifamily debt and equity is only about  $4\%$  of their total investment portfolio. Within the pension fund community, many funds have no holdings in real estate, whatsoever. Life companies and banks have always used real estate investing to extract a differential spread on the more debt-like aspects of the investment universe.

Foreign investors' share of the market is likely to expand, as cross-border investing is increasingly a part of all investors' approach to their investment strategy. As domestic investors look offshore and foreign investors look to the large markets of the United States, the foreign investors' share will inevitably rise.
