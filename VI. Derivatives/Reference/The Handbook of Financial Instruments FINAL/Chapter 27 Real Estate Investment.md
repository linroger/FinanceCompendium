Real estate investments are characterized by the following structures:

■ Private commercial real estate equity , held as individual assets or in commingled vehicles.

Private commercial real estate debt, held as either directly issued whole loans or commercial mortgages held in funds and/or commingled vehicles.

■ Public real estate equity structured as REITs or real estate operating companies (REOCs).

■ Public commercial real estate debt structured as commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).

These structures represent the quadrants of the modern real estate investment universe. Exhibit 27.1 shows the approximate value and percentage shares of each quadrant through time. Clearly the real estate investment universe has changed appreciably over the past 20 years. In the past, the private debt and equity markets dominated the real estate investment universe. While public equity had long played a small role in the real estate capitalization structure, the role has grown sharply since the early 1990s when many distressed private owners of real estate turned to the public markets to recapitalize and thereby save their companies from extreme capital shortfalls. Real estate debt markets also turned to the public markets for capital and so the commercial mortgage-backed securities industry developed.

Debt and equity and public and private markets are all covered in the chapter on real estate because while the traditional definition of real estate was limited to private equity, this definition has given way to a more modern and appropriate definition. Prior to the early 1990s, the public debt and equity markets were not of significant size and the private debt market was the province of a handful of the largest insurance companies and, therefore was not routinely considered accessible to an institutional investor.

# TWO Distinguishing CHARACTERISTICS OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS

Real estate has two unique characteristics that materially influence its risk and return behaviors. Real estate is a hybrid asset with differing degrees of debt-oriented and equity-oriented investment behaviors and real estate values rarely fall to zero and stay at that level. Each of these distinguishing characteristics is developed below.

# Real Estate is a Debt/Equity Hybrid

A mix of debt-like and equity-like behaviors drives every real estate investment's performance. For example, consider the extreme case of a building leased in its entirety on a long-term triple net lease to a credit tenant. The contractually bound fixed-lease payments to the building's owner are analogous to the payments to a bondholder and are not similar in character to the payments to an equity investor. The value of this asset varies in step with the same types of influences to which a mortgage holder or a bondholder is subject; interest rate movements, inflation, and the creditworthiness of the tenant. At the other extreme, the value of a totally vacant building is tied to conditions in the space and capital markets and not nearly as influenced by interest rates and, of course, is not influenced at all by tenant credit. There are no cash flows to equate to bond flows. As the building becomes leased it evolves from pure equity to a debt-equity hybrid, with some of the influences on value elicited from the debt markets and others from the equity markets. If the building is ultimately leased to long-term credit tenants then it becomes more debt-like than equity-like. On the other hand, if the triple net lease building loses its tenant, then it very quickly reverts to a pure equity investment. Equityoriented value generators like the demand for and the supply of space, local market economic health, the building's location, and other building-specific attributes increase in their influence on value and on volatility, and, therefore, on the investment characteristics of the asset.

Commercial mortgages also exhibit this equity-like and debt-like convolution of behaviors. The creditworthiness of a building that is the collateral underlying a mortgage is dependent upon the lease structure as described above. This creditworthiness can shift on a dime under some conditions. Most commercial mortgages are non-recourse to the borrower, but are recourse to the asset. Thus there are times when a foreclosed mortgage becomes an unintentional (or, as a deliberate strategy, an intentional) equity holding. A CMBS issue is generally comprised of a pool of mortgages, placed on underlying real estate collateral. The cash flows from the mortgages are then carved up to produce high-grade bond cash flows and low-grade or unrated equity-like cash flows from the most subordinated pieces. The tranches between the top and bottom tranches are characterized by varying degrees of equity-like and debt-like behaviors driven largely by the nature of the underlying collateral.

# Real Estate Values Rarely Disappear

The second most important characteristic of real estate investments is that the asset is highly likely to have residual value no matter what kind of battering it may have suffered in the space and capital markets. All types of investments in real estate are ultimately grounded upon a physical asset. Real estate is not an "idea" for a business, nor is it a business that is dependent upon the employment of specific people—without whom the enterprise is valueless. Instead, a building is a physical structure that can probably be put to some use in some way over some period of time. This means that only in the rarest of circumstances does the value of an asset go to zero and stay there. This reality alone puts real estate and all of its variants in a distinct class.

# Using the Debt-Equity Mix

Given the definition of real estate as a debt-equity hybrid, it only makes sense for the real estate investor to consider real estate an asset for which the debt and equity components can be purposefully weighted to suit the investor's needs. Investors increasingly use all of the quadrants to create a debt-equity mix that exposes them to the influences to which they most wish to be exposed and protects them from undesirable influences. As well, real estate investors can use the public and private trading market to execute arbitrage strategies and to manage liquidity and transactions costs.

# THE NATURE OF THE INVESTORS

Who holds these real estate investments? The lion's share of the market has been, and continues to be, controlled by life insurance companies, banks, and private investors. Although the life company holdings as a percent of the total have declined significantly because some have gone public and wanted to purge their asset bases of the less well understood and valued holdings, and also because many experienced a tough cycle in the early 1990s. It is interesting that even in the face of that tough cycle, banks have held their relative position, as have pension funds and private investors. While pension funds look like real players at a  $10\%$  share of the institutional real estate market, in fact the portion of the average pension fund portfolio that is comprised of commercial and multifamily debt and equity is only about  $4\%$  of their total investment portfolio. Within the pension fund community, many funds have no holdings in real estate, whatsoever. Life companies and banks have always used real estate investing to extract a differential spread on the more debt-like aspects of the investment universe.

Foreign investors' share of the market is likely to expand, as cross-border investing is increasingly a part of all investors' approach to their investment strategy. As domestic investors look offshore and foreign investors look to the large markets of the United States, the foreign investors' share will inevitably rise.

# Private Equity

Private equity is the least volatile of all of the real estate quadrants. At a mean historic return of  $7.6\%$  and a standard deviation of  $5.3\%$ , private equity real estate appears to be an effective asset. But is the volatility understated?

The policy of most investors to mark their private assets to market only once each year creates a falsely tame picture of true mark-to-market performance. Certainly, if one were to assess the value of a stock equity only once each year its volatility would diminish significantly. On the other hand, it is reasonable to ask whether the volatility of stock equity is perhaps overstated. Doesn't there seem to be a considerable amount of noise around the mean value that cannot be explained by income volatility or by shifts in expectations or perceptions of risk? Thus, while it is likely the case that infrequent valuations do produce a dampening, it is not clear that much greater frequency would generate the truth.

Also, for the most part, private equity real estate investors are "self-policing" and conduct and pay for the valuation exercises themselves. This self-valuation is inherently conflicted and has indeed caused real concern. After the market crash of the late 1980s, there was much discussion and debate around valuation methodology and control and several significant investors took steps to separate themselves from the valuation process of the real estate assets they managed. To address these legitimate concerns, two important steps were taken by an increasing number of institutional investors. First, the valuation process is placed in the control of an independent third-party valuation enterprise and second, the valuations are conducted with greater frequency and timeliness. Both of these changes, especially the one regarding frequency, have made differences, yet we have not observed a radical shift in the volatility of the returns. So, this leads the industry to additional explanations for the low volatility of private real estate equity.

The cash flows emanating from real estate investments are in fact highly stable. Thus the values, based in large part on cash flows, are also relatively stable. Long leases, buildings rented to either single users, or those with many different users on staggered leases generate demonstrably stable cash flows that are not subject to short-lived shifts in the economic environment.

The second explanation for low volatility is that real estate is, by its very nature, a debt-equity hybrid and so each building is essentially a mixed asset portfolio in which the cross-correlation between the two differently driven behaviors operates to reduce overall volatility. Further, we know from studying the performance of different urban area markets and property types within markets that there is a great range of different cycles occurring simultaneously—in part driven by the differences in the degree of debt-like and equity-like behaviors. Thus in real estate, when the buildings and the markets are pooled into indexes, there is room for significant risk mitigation within the index. The cross-correlations among real estate market sectors are quite low. The result is that the volatility for the overall private equity real estate market looks, and may very well be, truly low.

Exhibit 27.3 presents the implied cap rate or yield across the total private equity real estate market and for each of the four major property types—office, industrial, retail, and apartment—based on data from the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREF) as calculated by PPR. Starting in the late 1970s, real estate values rose and cap rates fell gradually to a value peak in 1989. Retail values showed the greatest rise as caps fell to an unsustainable level of  $6\%$ . The second most aggressively priced property type was the office sector, which was briefly valued at a  $6\%$  cap rate, also. The recession of the early 1990s certainly had its origins in the real estate sector of the economy and values plummeted—more than  $60\%$  in many cases. There were specific situations where values fell by even more (but, again, virtually no values fell to zero and stayed there). Since that great correction, however, values and cap rates have improved and remained fairly stable on growing cash flows. By late 2001, cap rates were back to the kinds of levels sustained prior to the last cycle.

# Public Equity

Public equity is a structure applied to a pool of real estate assets that allows them to trade in the public market. The two primary structures (of course, traditional corporate structures are permissible as well) are the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), and the Real Estate Operating Company (REOC). The REOC is simply a regular corporation that operates real estate as its primary business activity. The REIT is explained next.

Contrary to its name, a REIT is not a trust—it is a tax election. A REIT is a company that offers shares for trade in the public market and generally acts as a perpetual ownership vehicle of one building or a pool of individual buildings. REITs are subject to certain rules to maintain their special tax status. For example, a REIT is required to pay out at least  $90\%$  of its accrual accounting-based earnings generated from the operations of the properties. Until 2000, REITs were encouraged to behave somewhat passively by rules constraining the volume of sales a REIT could execute in a year. These rules have been relaxed somewhat. In exchange for adherence to these rules, the income of the REIT is taxed at the investor level and not at the operating company level.

Most REITs employ leverage at the entity level and, therefore, experience greater volatility than is the case for unlevered private portfolios. The mean return for the all equity National Association of Real Estate Equity Trusts (NAREIT) was  $13.7\%$  and the standard deviation was  $15.9\%$ . Of course, the REIT also experiences public market price volatility and, therefore, leverage alone does not explain the difference between the volatility of a REIT and that of a pool of private equity. Exhibit 27.4 shows this volatility quite clearly. Total returns for REITs, over the time period shown, have ranged from a high of  $50\%$  to a low of less than  $20\%$  (excluding hotels, which are not always included in the core definition of real estate).

Clearly the volatility comes from how the income is priced and not from the income itself (see Exhibit 27.5). The behavior of the income derived from private equity and that from public real estate equity should be identical. Both income streams are derived from the cash flows obtained from leased buildings. And, in fact, the income streams are identical in character. A study done by Giliberto and Mengden showed that when public equity cash flows were priced using private market cap rates, the performance of the private market was replicated. Analogously, when private market cash flows were priced using public market yields, the performance of the private market was again replicated. So, it's all in the pricing. But which is right? Are REITs real estate or are REITs a creature of the larger stock equity markets with an entirely distinct and overwhelming pricing algorithm? This is an important question to investors who are contemplating using REITS as their sole exposure to the real estate asset class.

The answer to the question can be pursued by examining the correlation between REITs and the S&P 500 through time. Exhibit 27.6 presents this information.

The evidence suggests that while REITs were not real estate in the early 1980s up until the real estate market crash of the late 1980s, they were decidedly not stock equity in the most recent time period. In between those two extreme periods was a protracted period where REIT issuance was surging and where the correlation between REITs and the general stock market was generally drifting down. So what is the correct view to take on the question of whether or not REITs are real estate? It depends on what is happening in the larger stock equity market and the private real estate market. For example, when both the public stock equity market and the private real estate markets are rising, the correlation is likely to be very high; the two cycles feed one another. When real estate market fundamentals turn down, the divergence will rise. And, as has been the case in the 2000s, when the stock equity market is in bear mode, but property market fundamentals are structurally sound, again, the markets will experience divergent behaviors. The difference between the general stock market and the real estate market will be captured by both the public real estate markets as well as by the private markets. In other words, when the investor needs to see that real estate is real estate, and stock equity is stock equity, the difference asserts itself.

# Private Debt—Commercial and Multifamily Mortgages

Private commercial and multifamily mortgages comprise the largest portion of the real estate investment universe and are exactly what they appear to be; loans based on the value of a building for which the underlying building is collateral. These loans are almost universally non-recourse to the borrower and so the influence of the performance of the underlying collateral is of crucial importance to the performance of the loan. These loans can be fixedor floating-rate, on one building or on a portfolio of buildings, cross-collateralized or not, and amortizing or interest only. Each loan is essentially privately negotiated; there are no standards to guide underwriting, the magnitude of the proceeds, or any other aspect of the loan or the documentation of the loan.

Private debt is largely the province of life insurance companies. The distant second-largest holders of private mortgage debt are the banks and mortgage companies with the S&Ls and mutual savings banks declining in importance through time. From the late 1980s through the early 1990s, many S&Ls and other local lending entities were shut down and their holdings turned over to the Resolution Trust Corporation. The RTC was created to quickly and efficiently remove distressed assets from distressed lenders and to resell the assets at unbelievable discounts to new, presumably healthier holders. The "bad" loans were indeed rehabilitated quickly.

The spreads of ACLI loans over Treasuries are generally quite strong with the period following the real estate crash of the late 1980s posting very high spreads, and at a time when the risk was perhaps the lowest (construction had essentially shut down and the economy was recovering). Real estate markets are not immune from the general, and increasingly the global, capital markets as was evidenced by the great leap in spreads following the Russian default. Towards the end of 2001, spreads again rose as the perception of a new recession became a reality.

The heightened level of spreads is not merited by events in the commercial mortgage sector, as is clearly shown in Exhibit 27.7. While delinquencies through the last recession peaked at over  $6\%$ , delinquencies in the middle of 2001 were steady at one half of one percent. Of course, delinquencies are a lagging indicator of distress and so the final peak for this cycle is likely to be higher. Seminal research initiated by Snyderman examined cohorts of mortgage originations and found that the year in which a mortgage is originated has a tremendous impact on the ultimate performance of the mortgage. More recent research executed by Pappadopoulos suggests that default frequency, severity, and loss can be predicted using a model that integrates the conditions prevailing when a mortgage is originated and through its life, with the structure of the mortgage.

# Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS)

A newly emerged structure for holding commercial and multifamily mortgages is the CMBS. While various small efforts to securitize whole commercial loans emerged through the years preceding the passage of FIRREA and the creation of the RTC, securitization really is a child of the RTC. In the early 1990s pools of distressed loans were assembled out of failed thrifts, S&Ls, and commercial banks, and were sold at auction to the highest bidders. These pools were sometimes sold as pools of the whole loans, but as time went on it became clear that whole loans were less marketable than portfolios and structured vehicles. The RTC, working closely with Wall Street, began to sell various priorities of claims on the cash flows to meet the specific investment requirements and risk tolerances of buyers. This created a new type of lender—the conduit lender.

The conduit lender is any entity able to originate, underwrite, and securitize loans. The development of the product produced a massive response and new issuance of CMBS surged from a  $5-10 billion annual pace to today's$ 90 billion pace.

Each part of the origination and management process is identified and de-linked, increasingly executed by experts in each area. Originators, servicers, special servicers, master servicers, third-party inspectors, and environmental inspectors abound. Essentially, the whole loan has been decomposed into its dimensions of risk and each dimension is managed and invested in by an appropriate entity. This represents a far more sophisticated reengineering of a real estate investment than does the advent of REITs. REITs are no more than a publicly-traded portfolio of private equities while each tranche of each CMBS is not at all similar in behavior and risk to the underlying mortgage from which it is created. The commercial mortgage-backed security represents a revolution in real estate finance.

CMBS spreads have generally tracked spreads in the whole loan market except that the spreads really widen out for the lower and unrated tranches. Currently, the B pieces trade at 900 basis points over Treasuries while AAAs trade at 150 basis points. As was evident for whole loan spreads, there was a widening that occurred along with the Russian default and a generally heightened level of concern for credit risk in 1998. In fact, just prior to that crisis the spreads had become extremely tight as competition from conduits heated up. Even the spreads on the lowest rated and unrated pieces had tightened.

While ACLI delinquencies are quite low, CMBS delinquencies have begun to rise.[6] Some argue that along with the revolution in issuance, the credit of the whole loans used to create the CMBS has deteriorated. Perhaps a less rigorous job is in fact being done in the underwriting and in the servicing and monitoring of CMBS. If this proves true, it will set the development of the sector back.

Ultimately, however, it is likely that the CMBS market will prosper because it makes a great deal of intuitive sense. Each commercial and multifamily loan is very large, limiting the number of lenders that can offer financing. The possibly excessive spread (at least relative to corporate debt at the same credit levels) could be competed away if there were more lenders able to raise capital from smaller and smaller investors, even from individuals, as the securitized pieces can be infinitely divided. Investors in whole loans have to accept the entire return and risk spectrum while investors in CMBS can select exactly where they wish to be in the risk/return hierarchy. From a portfolio management perspective, this structure transforms an unwieldy investment into a precise tool for getting exactly what is needed for a portfolio.

# REAL ESTATE IN THE MIXED ASSET PORTFOLIO

There are five primary reasons to consider real estate for inclusion in an investment portfolio:

- Reduce the overall risk of the portfolio by combining asset classes that respond differently to expected and unexpected events
Achieve a high absolute return
Hedge against unexpected inflation
Constitute a part of a portfolio that is a reasonable reflection of the overall investment universe (an indexed, or market-neutral portfolio)
Deliver strong cash flows to the portfolio

Whether or not real estate can accomplish any of these goals, in the short term as well as over the long haul, has not been an easy question to answer. Two decades of research has yielded little bullet-proof evidence that real estate has a significant role to play in an institutional portfolio. In the analysis in the next section, a cap-weighted index comprised of the components of the real estate investment universe is used to capture the performance of real estate (see Exhibit 27.8). Of course, the cap-weighted index only represents one way to take advantage of the risk mitigation opportunities inherent across the quadrants of the real estate investment universe (all of the cross-correlations within real estate are less than 0.6). Other weighting schemes could be, and are, used by investors.

# Real Estate as a Portfolio Diversifier/Risk Reducer

Using the real estate investment universe index (PPR REI), we can calculate the optimal allocation for real estate in a mixed asset class portfolio of stocks, bonds, and cash. The overall bond market is measured by the Lehman Corporate/Government bond index, the stock market is measured by the S&P 500, and cash is measured by the Treasury bill rate. The parameters for the optimization (using quarterly returns from 1987:1 through 2001:3) are shown in Exhibit 27.9 and the results of the optimization are shown in Exhibit 27.10.

The correlations between real estate and stocks, real estate and bonds, and real estate and cash suggest that real estate can play a significant role in a mixed asset portfolio. Real estate's role extends from the lowest risk end of the efficient frontier to just past the midpoint of the mixed asset frontier. This makes sense as real estate is both a low-risk asset itself and a risk reducer in a stock and bond portfolio. Clearly, investors who wish to simply go for broke and seek the highest possible return, regardless of risk, will choose to allocate heavily toward stocks and will have no allocation to real estate as defined here. This evidence suggests that real estate is suitable for investors interested in capital preservation and who need to earn a useful rate of return. At one point along the lower half of the frontier, the model calls for an allocation of  $16\%$  to real estate. This weight drops to zero as one moves up the frontier.

# Real Estate as an Absolute Return Enhancer

The second possible reason to include real estate in an investment portfolio is to bring high absolute and/or risk-adjusted returns to the portfolio. The data in Exhibit 27.9 show that, on average, real estate did not outperform stocks and bonds in absolute terms over the past 15 years. When assessed in terms of total return per unit of risk, real estate outperforms both stocks and bonds. However, employing the more commonly used Sharpe ratio and assuming a risk-free rate of  $5.4\%$  (the cash return for the period), real estate fails to outperform stocks on a risk-adjusted basis (see Exhibit 27.11).

Thus, in the aggregate, it would not be justifiable to include real estate in a portfolio for the sole reason of bringing high absolute or risk-adjusted returns to the overall portfolio. There are, however, several other questions to ask about real estate's ability to deliver high absolute and risk-adjusted returns:

■ Did real estate outperform stocks or bonds in some quarters? Yes, there are periods in which the full quadrant definition of real estate is able to outperform stocks and bonds (in 2000 and in 2001).

- Do some components of the real estate investment universe outperform stocks or bonds on average over the period? Yes, public equity real estate well outperforms bonds during the period, but none of the components of the real estate index outperform the overall stock average.
- Do each of the components of real estate outperform stocks or bonds in individual quarters? Yes, each of the four components of the real estate investment universe experienced periods in which the real estate components' returns were above stock or bond returns. There are a good number of quarters when each component beats bonds, and even a few quarters in which all four components beat stocks.

The conclusion is that, in its aggregate investment universe form, real estate does not reliably produce high returns relative to the stock and bond investment classes. However, some real estate components provide absolute return benefits and real estate's lower volatility offers the investor some useful protection.

# Real Estate as an Inflation Hedge

Conventional wisdom has held that real estate performs as an inflation hedge. This means that if inflation is greater than expected, real estate returns will compensate for the surprise and will help offset the negative response of the other assets in the portfolio. The rationale is important if it is accurate. Real estate returns have a complicated relationship with inflation. Inflation elicits different responses in the different property types through divergent impacts on the income and value components of return, and through variation in the effects of both past and the most recent inflation. Next, we look at the response of private equity to inflation.

Past inflation is partially embedded in rents set previously because every seller of every product, including sellers of rental space, wishes to keep prices level or rising in real terms. Thus current net operating income (NOI) is partly a function of past inflation—rising if past inflation has been greater, and falling (or rising less) if past inflation has been tame. The speed with which such inflation affects NOI, or the time lag necessary to capture inflation's impact on current NOI, depends on the structure of leases, which, in turn, varies with property type. Current office NOI reflects the inflation experience of one to ten years ago while apartment NOI reflects more recent inflation. The impact of past inflation is positive for all four major property types.

Current inflation impacts the levels of current rents and expenses. Current inflation raises NOI by increasing the rental rate on new leases, but lowers NOI by raising all expenses. In the office, warehouse, and apartment markets, current inflation causes NOIs to fall as the rise in current rents associated with recent leases does not fully offset the increase in expenses, which impact the entire asset. However, in the retail sector, current inflation raises NOI, as the impact on rents and percentage rents (which apply to all or much of the square footage in the building) more than offsets the impact on the few expenses that are not passed through. Retail, then, has two characteristics (percentage rents and the generous passthrough of expenses) that render it a very capable transmitter of inflation to asset performance.

Inflation impacts the capital value return in two ways. First, it impacts current NOI, as described above, which feeds through to value via the capitalization rate. This feed is especially strong for retail assets. In addition, inflation affects the cap rate directly by influencing NOI growth expectations and, therefore, investors' demand for real estate investments. The direct capital value impact of inflation is significantly positive for apartment and office properties, but not significantly different from zero for warehouse.

Thus, the empirical assessment shows that private equity real estate is a partial inflation hedge. That said, it is also clear that the degree of inflation-hedging capacity is not uniform across property types.

As with most debt, real estate debt is not a good inflation hedge because unexpected inflation and concomitant increases in nominal interest rates negatively impact the value of outstanding securities (mortgages and CMBS). Publicly traded forms of equity real estate will capture some of the benefits of the inflation hedge but are less successful transmitters of this value than private equity because of links to the stock market, which is generally damaged by inflation. So, if inflation hedging is a key reason why an investor chooses an allocation to real estate, that investor must tilt the portfolio toward private equity.

# Real Estate as a Reflection of the Investment Universe

Real estate may have a role in a balanced investment portfolio simply because real estate is an important part of the investment universe. Any portfolio that does not include real estate is based on a bet that real estate will perform less well than is implied by the market-driven relative prices. Indeed, any allocation to real estate that does not reflect real estate's overall share in the investment universe implies a different bet from that of an indexed portfolio.

Unfortunately, determining the size of the total real estate investment universe to set the weight for real estate in an indexed portfolio has proven difficult. Using some broadly correct figures for the size of the market and data from the Flow of Funds report from the Federal Reserve Board for the size of the stock, bond, and cash sectors puts real estate at approximately  $6\%$  of the current investment universe. Of course, more recent shifts towards continued value growth in real estate and distress in the stock market, all compounded by recession, will cause further shifts in the relative weights.

# Strong Cash Flows

An important dimension of the total return derived from a real estate investment is the proportion of that return that is derived from income. On average, real estate produces a long-term average cash yield of about  $9\%$  which compares with a cash dividend from stocks that averages about  $3\%$  and a yield from bonds that averages almost  $8\%$ . If an investor is concerned with the degree of certainty of return and has a need for cash returns, then real estate can serve a useful function.

# Relevance to the Investor

It is clear that real estate has more than one role to play and that the investor needs to think about how to invest in real estate as well as whether to invest. But, in order to reach a conclusion about the role of real estate in a particular investment portfolio, it is important to think through the different types of investors and their needs.

# A Risk-Tolerant Investor

Real estate is a risk reducer at low to moderate risk and return levels and so has no role in highly risk-tolerant portfolios. Thus, investors willing and able to seek the greatest return and unconcerned with capital preservation or volatility in returns would not be inclined to allocate any part of their portfolios to real estate as defined in this chapter. Such an investor is not concerned with real estate's size in the context of the overall investment universe and presumably is not concerned about inflation.

While some parts of the real estate universe do periodically outperform equities, on average real estate is not a way to earn the greatest return. Such risk-tolerant investors might include individuals with "money to burn" or extremely overfunded corporate pension funds where the corporation wishes to go for broke as a way to add to earnings.

A final category of investor might be an extremely underfunded pension fund that needs to stretch to achieve full funding (although this behavior would be inconsistent with the risk management mantra of ERISA). There are more fiduciarily responsible ways to achieve this particular objective. There are very few investors in this group because it is somewhat irresponsible to completely disregard risk.

# A Risk-Sensitive Investor

The application of real estate as a partial solution to an investor's needs depends on the risk-sensitivity of the investor. If the investor is mostly concerned with capital preservation and has a typical actuarial return requirement, real estate will be an important part of the portfolio. The lower the return requirement and the greater the concern about risk, the greater will be the preferred allocation to real estate, up to the  $16\%$  level indicated by the allocations presented earlier in this chapter. As these investors' concern for capital preservation eases somewhat and their need for return rises, they will use less and less real estate until they have crossed the midpoint of the frontier when they will use none. The territory to the left of the midpoint of the frontier is the area relevant to low to moderate risk investors; pension funds with known liabilities and moderate actuarial rates of return, families wishing to ensure that wealth is preserved for future generations, and insurance companies and banks matching liabilities with well-understood cash flows and risk levels.

Risk-sensitive investors also generally prefer to line up with the larger investor community and are therefore interested in the size of the real estate market relative to other asset classes. An allocation that is seriously overor underweight relative to the true investment universe represents a bet away from an important norm.

Risk-sensitive investors and those who have heavy demands for cash to satisfy liability streams will also have an interest in an asset like real estate with its relatively high yields. Returns derived from capital gains are riskier than those generated in tangible, realized cash. While overall returns might be lower than those for lower-yielding assets such as stocks, the certainty and size of the cash return is greater.

# An Inflation-Sensitive Investor

If an investor must pay out a liability stream in real dollars, the inflation-hedging role of real estate is of interest. One of the best examples of such an investor is a defined-benefit pension fund. They are required to pay beneficiaries in real goods and services, not in nominal cash. Clearly, the cost of providing these health and retirement benefits is going to be greatly impacted by the incidence and the level of inflation. Another example would be a foundation or endowment interested in using a part of the cash flow from the investment portfolio to purchase art, provide students with scholarships, or create new physical plant (e.g., museums or educational facilities). All of these uses of the return from the portfolio are measured in real terms and would suffer from erosion in the purchasing power of the cash flows.

Real estate is truly one of the only vehicles able to partially preserve its value during a period of inflation. Inflation-indexed Treasury instruments are an assured way to hedge, but at the cost of lower returns. The time to put a hedge in place is before, not once, inflation occurs, so investors with real liabilities need an exposure to inflation hedges at all times.

# LEVERAGE

While owners of residences routinely use leverage as a means to avail themselves of a home, it is less routinely used by institutional investors in real estate. This is because the use of leverage raises some philosophical and operational issues for institutional investors who are invested in multiple asset types. For purposes of this chapter, positive spread leverage at "reasonable" levels is discussed.

Leverage is the simple act of borrowing money based on the value and the security of the underlying collateral, in this case a building. Again the focus is on non-recourse (to the borrower) debt. Because of the non-recourse structure, for the borrower the use of leverage is analogous to short-selling the asset. The borrower takes the proceeds and can "put" the asset to the lender at any time with no further penalties. As mentioned earlier, while it is rare for an asset's value to go to zero and stay there, it is not unheard of for a borrower to be unable to support the mortgage payment through a rough market cycle. Further, it is not unheard of for a lender to lend too much, based on an artificially inflated value. Thus the option value of the put is quite real.

An investor would choose to use leverage to:

Increase the total return on an asset

Hedge the downside risk of an asset's value

■ Enable a fixed amount of capital to be spread over a larger number of individual investments

■ Increase the yield and cash flow generated from a fixed pool of assets

- Reduce exposure to an asset or a pool of assets as a way of reducing exposure to the asset class
Enhance the ability of real estate to act as a diversifier vis-à-vis the other assets in the mixed asset portfolio

The final reason warrants further exposition. As discussed at the start of this chapter, real estate is a debt-equity hybrid. Thus, applying leverage to a building encumbered by one or more leases is a way of essentially "shorting out" the debt-like aspects of the asset's behavior. This then creates a heightened role for the equity-like aspects of the asset's behavior. This has the additional effect of enhancing the diversification effect of real estate in the context of a mixed asset portfolio; essentially "pure" real estate equity behavior is what remains.

Of course, leverage increases risk as measured by the volatility of the total return of the leveraged asset. This is inescapable. However, volatility has positive and negative dimensions to it. It often makes sense to apply leverage to assets that are, in other ways, less risky than average, thus the application of leverage does not imply that risk rises to unacceptable levels. As well, as was discussed in the section of mortgage debt and delinquency, the condition of the market when the debt is applied will greatly impact the ultimate health of the debt.

For institutional investors investing in multiple asset classes, there are benefits and issues with using leverage on the real estate portfolio. First, the diversification of the real estate portfolio itself can be enhanced with the use of leverage, assuming that appropriate allocations are made with the real estate portfolio. Second, the real estate asset produces enhanced diversification vis-à-vis stocks, bonds, and bills when it is leveraged.

However, the mixed asset investor must also wrestle with the following question—does it ever make logical sense for the same investor to be a borrower and a lender (by making fixed income investments) at the same time? And, even worse, typically the rate at which the borrowing occurs will be greater than the like-credit rate at which the lending occurs. Don't these two approaches essentially neutralize one another while also incurring transaction costs? Of course, in the stock equity world this situation is routine, because most securities are issued by companies that use leverage. The stock investor, however, does not have a choice while the real estate investor (except the REIT investor) does.

So perhaps the fixed income side of an institutional investor could lend to the real estate side? Right up until the moment where there were no problems, there would be no problems, and then the trouble would begin. The two sides of the same investor organization would be conflicted and the situation would be untenable. This would be especially true in a typical situation where the portfolio manager for each asset class is expected to defend his own return and is not accountable for the overall fund level return.

Finally, leverage must be regarded as way for the borrower to raise capital, not to use capital. If a fund is not fully deployed in highly productive investment activities, it is hard to see why leverage would make sense.

Leverage then is a useful portfolio management tool as long as the philosophical issues are put aside and the real estate portfolio manager is judged on his independent performance.

# INVESTMENT EXECUTION

In general, real estate is brought into the portfolio via:

Dedicated portfolios of individual assets executed by an in-house staff or by hiring outside managers, and/or via

- Commingled funds that are either open or closed ended. These funds may be structured as insurance company separate accounts, private REITs, trusts, or public REITs.

Real estate investment carries with it significant execution costs both in terms of the staff required (either in-house or third party) to invest and manage and in terms of the actual costs of executing any transaction. The execution costs include expected costs such as brokerage fees, but also include more subtle ones such as search and underwriting costs. Much effort can be expended on transactions that are ultimately either deemed unworthy or are lost to a competitive bid.

Because of this reality, real estate investing, with the sole exception of investors who invest in public equity, is the province of the institutional player. There are a few commingled openand closed-end vehicles available to smaller institutional investors, but there is close to nothing available for small institutions, endowments, foundations, and families, and certainly nothing (except REITS) of any magnitude available for individual investors. Given the nature of the investment process—one deal at a time, with large pools of capital required for each investment—real estate is virtually a closed shop.

This will change as the very nature of the institutional investor is changing. As a nation we are rapidly moving from defined-benefit pension plans to defined-contribution plans. The participants in the DC plans will absolutely want to be able to access a risk mitigator like real estate, and over time the investment industry will figure out how to meet their needs. REITs are a good start as they control the same types of assets that are controlled by the private vehicles. CMBS presents another opportunity for the democratization of real estate investing. As baby boomers age and begin to be more interested in cash flow and less interested in the volatility associated with growth, commercial real estate debt investing will take on new interest. But until the nut is cracked, the large institutions will dominate the field and reap the benefits, including real estate, in their portfolios.

# OVERVIEW OF ADDITIONAL ISSUES

In this section the important additional issues of private equity valuation and performance measurement and attribution are presented.

# Valuation

As alluded to in the discussion of private equity, valuation continues to be an issue, especially for private equity, but then by extension, for any collateral underlying any mortgage or tranche of CMBS. Even with public market pricing in the world of public equity, constant debate exists about the true net asset value of each REIT. While there is no magic bullet for this problem, there are some sensible changes that could be made to the methods used in the valuation industry.

Currently, appraisal professionals exist who use the three methods to estimate an asset's value; the cost approach, the comparables approach, and the income approach. In the world of modern finance only the income approach has any real merit, as it is essentially a discounted cash flow method, exactly as used for other assets. The cost approach can only be interesting to a researcher who might want to know whether values are at or below cost for the purpose of estimating the likelihood of new supply appearing in the market. Clearly, when values exceed the cost of construction, it is likely that new supply will occur. Other than that, there is absolutely no reason why value should bear any short-run relationship to cost. The comparables approach is flawed as it is inherently backward looking and valuation is inherently forward looking. When markets move, this approach is virtually guaranteed to provide an incorrect perspective.

Thus, the industry truly needs to increase the rigor of the income approach. Discount rates should be linked to careful analysis of relative risk, and future rent growth and vacancy scenarios should be better linked to thorough market analysis. The analysis should be rerun as soon as any variable in the cash flow forecast changes. Thus, values would be constantly adjusted as new information is received and there would be less room for judgments and looking over one's shoulder. The deficiency of the valuation system presents a serious challenge for the industry.

# Performance Measurement

There are several calculations employed to measure the performance of real estate investments, and several associations collect and disseminate performance statistics on certain dimensions of the real estate investment universe. The National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) collects data on the income and capital value returns for a group of private equity assets held by tax-exempt investors. Commercial Mortgage Securitization Association (CMSA) and Lehman Brothers have begun the work of documenting the performance of CMBS. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) collects and disseminates performance data on the publicly traded REIT industry. A private firm, The John B. Levy Company, produces a modeled statistic on the performance of private debt. Unfortunately, none of these sources is as comprehensive as one would like and so each "benchmark" must be used with a great deal of knowledge of the specific inclusions and limitations of the data.

In real estate, different investors use different calculations to measure performance—the internal rate of return, the time-weighted return, the average annual return, and the since-inception return are some of the measures used. In some cases, investors estimate a value in order to calculate the return and in other cases investors simply look at the cash-on-cash return of an investment. The bottom line is that there is no single standard by which real estate performance is measured.

Attribution analysis is in a very preliminary stage of development in the real estate investment community, partly because the data to support such analysis are weak and partly as a reflection of the generally less analytic predisposition of the investors (although this is changing).

# Hold/Sell in the Traditional Private Equity Market

The inverse of the sell decision is the buy decision and any decision not to sell is a decision to re-buy. The criteria for the sell decision are multileveled. There are portfolio level considerations—does the market and property type exposure of the asset help or harm the investor's ability to achieve the investment goals of the overall portfolio? There are market level considerations—does the specific market in which the asset resides continue to provide the most effective way to bring the behavior of a desired sector to the portfolio? And there are asset level considerations—is the asset itself able to bring to the market, the sector, and the portfolio the behavior that is required of the asset?

While for other asset classes the hold/sell decision can be based substantially on the criteria presented above, in real estate there is one additional consideration—the cost of selling and redeploying the proceeds of the sale. Costs include staff time, commissions, taxes, and elapsed time. Particularly in the private portions of the real estate capital markets, costs are often significant and can reach levels where it is better to do nothing than it is to rebalance the portfolio.

# CONCLUSION

Real estate is an emerging investment class in the context of some institutional portfolios. Pension funds hold very little real estate in general and almost no debt, insurance companies have long used private debt and equity and are using the public debt market increasingly, while banks are decreasing holders of debt and are not generally holders of equity. One of the major issues in real estate investment is the lack of divisible ways to invest in real estate. This causes the largest investors to have greater access to the asset than smaller investors and individuals. Increasing securitization is helping to democratize access to the class.

While real estate has a role in a mixed asset portfolio, real estate is not a reliable outperformer relative to the other major assets. Real estate is a diversifier, an inflation hedge, a good source of cash returns, and a significant segment of the overall investment capital market.
