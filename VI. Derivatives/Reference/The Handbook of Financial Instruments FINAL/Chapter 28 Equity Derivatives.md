Derivative instruments, or simply derivatives, are contracts that essentially derive their value from the behavior of cash market instruments such as stocks, stock indexes, bonds, currencies, and commodities that underlie the contract. When the underlying for a derivative is a stock or stock index, the contract is called an equity derivative. The purpose of this chapter is to explain these instruments, their investment characteristics, and to provide an overview as to how they are priced. The basic features described in this chapter for equity derivatives apply to fixed income derivatives, the subject of the next chapter.

# THE ROLE OF DERIVATIVES

Equity derivatives have several properties that provide economic benefits that make them excellent candidates for use in equity portfolio management. These properties are derived from the following four roles that derivatives serve in portfolio management: (1) to modify the risk characteristics of a portfolio (risk management); (2) to enhance the expected return of a portfolio (returns management); (3) to reduce transaction costs associated with managing a portfolio (cost management); and, (4) to achieve efficiency in the presence of legal, tax, or regulatory obstacles (regulatory management).

Institutional equity investors have the means to accomplish investment objectives with a host of products and product structures. Pension funds, for example, can structure a product to meet their asset allocation targets, to access foreign markets, or to explicitly manage risk. Products that may meet their needs include listed stock index futures and equity swaps. The choice of an instrument depends on the specific investor needs and circumstances. In each case, the benefits from structuring a derivatives solution to an investment problem either involves cost reduction, risk management, or the management of certain legal or regulatory restrictions.

Equity derivatives give investors more degrees of freedom. In the past, the implementation and management of an investment strategy for pension funds, for example, was a function of management style and was carried out in the cash market. Pension funds managed risk by diversifying among management styles. Prior to the advent of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market in the late 1980s, the first risk management tools available to investors were limited to the listed futures and options markets. Although providing a valuable addition to an investor's risk management tool kit, listed derivatives were limited in application due to their standardized features, limited size, and liquidity constraints. The OTC derivatives market gives investors access to longer-term products that better match their investment horizon and provides flexible structures to meet their exact risk/reward requirements. The number of unique equity derivative structures is essentially unlimited.

# EQUITY DERIVATIVES MARKET

The three general categories of derivatives are (1) futures and forwards, (2) options, and (3) swaps. The basic derivative securities are futures/ forward contracts and options. Swaps and other derivative structures with more complicated payoffs are regarded as hybrid securities, which can be shown to be nothing more than portfolios of forwards, options, and cash instruments in varying combinations.

Equity derivatives can also be divided into two categories according to whether they are listed or OTC. The listed market consists of options, warrants, and futures contracts. The principal listed options market consists of exchange-traded options with standardized strike prices, expirations, and payout terms traded on individual stocks, equity indexes, and futures contracts on equity indexes. A FFlexible EXchange (FLEX) Option was introduced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1993 that provides the customization feature of the OTC market, but with the guarantee of the exchange. The listed futures market consists of exchange-traded equity index futures with standardized settlement dates and settlement terms.

OTC equity derivatives are not traded on an exchange and have an advantage over listed derivatives because they provide complete flexibility and can be tailored to fit an investment strategy. The OTC equity derivatives market can be divided into three components: OTC options and warrants, equity-linked debt investments, and equity swaps. OTC equity options are customized option contracts that can be applied to any equity index, basket of stocks, or an individual stock. OTC options are privately negotiated agreements between an investor and an issuing dealer. The structure of the option is completely flexible in terms of strike price, expiration, and payout features.

A fundamental difference between listed and OTC derivatives, however, is that listed options and futures contracts are guaranteed by the exchange, while in the OTC market the derivative is the obligation of a non-exchange entity that is the counterparty. Thus, the investor is subject to credit risk or counterparty risk.

# LISTED EQUITY OPTIONS

Equity derivative products are either exchange-traded listed derivatives or over-the-counter derivatives. In this section we will look at listed equity options.

An option is a contract in which the option seller grants the option buyer the right to enter into a transaction with the seller to either buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price on or before a specified date. The specified price is called the strike price or exercise price and the specified date is called the expiration date. The option seller grants this right in exchange for a certain amount of money called the option premium or option price.

The option seller is also known as the option writer, while the option buyer is the option holder. The asset that is the subject of the option is called the underlying. The underlying can be an individual stock, a stock index, or another derivative instrument such as a futures contract. The option writer can grant the option holder one of two rights. If the right is to purchase the underlying, the option is a call option. If the right is to sell the underlying, the option is a put option.

An option can also be categorized according to when it may be exercised by the buyer. This is referred to as the exercise style. A European option can only be exercised at the expiration date of the contract. An American option can be exercised any time on or before the expiration date.

The terms of exchange are represented by the contract unit, which is typically 100 shares for an individual stock and a multiple times an index value for a stock index. The terms of exchange are standard for most contracts. The contract terms for a FLEX option can be customized along four dimensions: underlying asset, strike price, expiration date, and settlement style. These options are discussed further below.

The option holder enters into the contract with an opening transaction. Subsequently, the option holder then has the choice to exercise or to sell the option. The sale of an existing option by the holder is a closing sale.

# Listed versus OTC Equity Options

There are three advantages of listed options relative to OTC options. First, the strike price and expiration dates of the contract are standardized. Second, the direct link between buyer and seller is severed after the order is executed because of the fungible nature of listed options. The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) serves as the intermediary between buyer and seller. Finally, transaction costs are lower for listed options than their OTC counterparts.

There are many situations in which an institutional investor needs a customized option. The higher cost of OTC options reflects this customization. However, some OTC exotic option structures may prove to cost less than the closest standardized option because a more specific payout is being bought.

A significant distinction between a listed option and an OTC option is the presence of credit risk or counterparty risk. Only the option buyer is exposed to counterparty risk. Options traded on exchanges and OTC options traded over a network of market makers have different ways of dealing with the problem of credit risk. Organized exchanges reduce counterparty risk by requiring margin, marking to the market daily, imposing size and price limits, and providing an intermediary that takes both sides of a trade. The clearing process provides three levels of protection: (1) the customer's margin, (2) the member firm's guarantee, and (3) the clearinghouse. The OTC market has incorporated a variety of terms into the contractual agreement between counterparties to address the issue of credit risk and these are described when we discuss OTC derivatives.

For listed options, there are no margin requirements for the buyer of an option once the option price has been paid in full. Because the option price is the maximum amount that the option buyer can lose, no matter how adverse the price movement of the underlying, margin is not necessary. The option writer has agreed to transfer the risk inherent in a position in the underlying from the option buyer to itself. The writer, on the other hand, has certain margin requirements.

Stock options refer to listed options on individual stocks or American Depository Receipts (ADRs). The underlying is 100 shares of the designated stock. All listed stock options in the United States may be exercised any time before the expiration date; that is, they are American style options.

Index options are options where the underlying is a stock index rather than an individual stock. An index call option gives the option buyer the right to buy the underlying stock index, while a put option gives the option buyer the right to sell the underlying stock index. Unlike stock options where a stock can be delivered if the option is exercised by the option holder, it would be extremely complicated to settle an index option by delivering all the stocks that constitute the index. Instead, index options are cash settlement contracts. This means that if the option is exercised by the option holder, the option writer pays cash to the option buyer. There is no delivery of any stocks.

The most liquid index options are those on the S&P 100 index (OEX) and the S&P 500 index. Both trade on the CBOE. Index options can be listed as American or European. The S&P 500 index option contract is European, while the OEX is American. Both index option contracts have specific standardized features and contract terms. Moreover, both have short expiration cycles. There are almost 100 stock index option contracts listed across 26 separate exchanges and 20 countries. Among the latest arrivals are options traded on the Dow Jones STOXX 50 and the Dow Jones EURO 50 stock indexes. The indexes are comprised of 50 industrial, commercial, and financial European blue chip companies.

The following mechanics should be noted for index options. The dollar value of the stock index underlying an index option is equal to the current cash index value multiplied by the contract's multiple. That is,

$$
\begin{array}{l} D o l a r v a l u e \quad o f \quad t h e \quad \text {u n d e r l y i n g} \\ = \text {C a s h i n d e x v a l u e} \times \text {C o n t r a c t m u l t i p l e} \\ \end{array}
$$

For example, if the cash index value for the S&P 100 is 530, then the dollar value of the S&P 100 contract is 530 \times \100 = \$53,000.

For a stock option, the price at which the buyer of the option can buy or sell the stock is the strike price. For an index option, the strike index is the index value at which the buyer of the option can buy or sell the underlying stock index. The strike index is converted into a dollar value by multiplying the strike index by the multiple for the contract. For example, if the strike index is 510, the dollar value is  $51,000 (510 \times$ 100). If an investor purchases a call option on the S&P 100 with a strike index of 510, and exercises the option when the index value is 530, then the investor has the right to purchase the index for $51,000 when the market value of the index is $53,000. The buyer of the call option would then receive $2,000 from the option writer.

The other two categories listed in Exhibit 28.1, LEAPS and FLEX options, essentially modify an existing feature of either a stock option, an index option, or both. For example, stock option and index option contracts have short expiration cycles. Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPS) are designed to offer options with longer maturities. These contracts are available on individual stocks and some indexes. Stock option LEAPS are comparable to standard stock options except the maturities can range up to 39 months from the origination date. Index options LEAPS differ in size compared with standard index options having a multiplier of 10 rather than 100.

FLEX options allow users to specify the terms of the option contract for either a stock option or an index option. The value of FLEX options is the ability to customize the terms of the contract along four dimensions: underlying, strike price, expiration date, and settlement style. Moreover, the exchange provides a secondary market to offset or alter positions and an independent daily marking of prices. The development of the FLEX option is a response to the growing OTC market. The exchanges seek to make the FLEX option attractive by providing price discovery through a competitive auction market, an active secondary market, daily price valuations, and the virtual elimination of counterparty risk. The FLEX option represents a link between listed options and OTC products.

# Risk and Return Characteristics of Options

Now let's illustrate the risk and return characteristics of the four basic option positions—buying a call option (long a call option), selling a call option (short a call option), buying a put option (long a put option), and selling a put option (short a put option). We will use stock options in our example. The illustrations assume that each option position is held to the expiration date. Also, to simplify the illustrations, we assume that the underlying for each option is for 1 share of stock rather than 100 shares and we ignore transaction costs.

# Buying Call Options

Assume that there is a call option on stock XYZ that expires in one month and has a strike price of $100. The option price is $3. Suppose that the current or spot price of stock XYZ is $100. (The spot price is the cash market price.) The profit and loss will depend on the price of stock XYZ at the expiration date. The buyer of a call option benefits if the price rises above the strike price. If the price of stock XYZ is equal to $103, the buyer of a call option breaks even. The maximum loss is the option price, and there is substantial upside potential if the stock price rises above $103. Using a graph, Exhibit 28.2 shows the profit/loss profile for the buyer of this call option at the expiration date.

It is worthwhile to compare the profit and loss profile of the call option buyer with that of an investor taking a long position in one share of stock XYZ. The payoff from the position depends on stock XYZ's price at the expiration date. An investor who takes a long position in stock XYZ realizes a profit of  $1 for every$ 1 increase in stock XYZ's price. As stock XYZ's price falls, however, the investor loses, dollar for dollar. If the price drops by more than $3, the long position in stock XYZ results in a loss of more than $3. The long call position, in contrast, limits the loss to only the option price of $3 but retains the upside potential, which will be $3 less than for the long position in stock XYZ. Which alternative is better, buying the call option or buying the stock? The answer depends on what the investor is attempting to achieve.

# Writing Call Options

To illustrate the option seller's, or writer's, position, we use the same call option we used to illustrate buying a call option. The profit/loss profile at expiration of the short call position (that is, the position of the call option writer) is the mirror image of the profit and loss profile of the long call position (the position of the call option buyer). That is, the profit of the short call position for any given price for stock XYZ at the expiration date is the same as the loss of the long call position. Consequently, the maximum profit the short call position can produce is the option price. The maximum loss is not limited because it is the highest price reached by stock XYZ on or before the expiration date, less the option price; this price can be indefinitely high. Using a graph, Exhibit 28.2 shows the profit/loss profile for the seller of this call option at the expiration date.

# Buying Put Options

To illustrate a long put option position, we assume a hypothetical put option on one share of stock XYZ with one month to maturity and a strike price of  $100. Assume that the put option is selling for$ 2 and the spot price of stock XYZ is $100. The profit or loss for this position at the expiration date depends on the market price of stock XYZ. The buyer of a put option benefits if the price falls. Using a graph, Exhibit 28.3 shows the profit/loss profile for the buyer of this put option at the expiration date.

EXHIBIT 28.2 Profit/Loss Profile at Expiration for a Short Call Position and a Long Call Position

EXHIBIT 28.3 Profit/Loss Profile at Expiration for a Short Put Position and a Long Put Position

As with all long option positions, the loss is limited to the option price. The profit potential, however, is substantial: the theoretical maximum profit is generated if stock XYZ's price falls to zero. Contrast this profit potential with that of the buyer of a call option. The theoretical maximum profit for a call buyer cannot be determined beforehand because it depends on the highest price that can be reached by stock XYZ before or at the option expiration date.

To see how an option alters the risk/return profile for an investor, we again compare it with a position in stock XYZ. The long put position is compared with a short position in stock XYZ because such a position would also benefit if the price of the stock falls. While the investor taking a short stock position faces all the downside risk as well as the upside potential, an investor taking the long put position faces limited downside risk (equal to the option price) while still maintaining upside potential reduced by an amount equal to the option price.

# Writing Put Options

The profit and loss profile for a short put option is the mirror image of the long put option. The maximum profit to be realized from this position is the option price. The theoretical maximum loss can be substantial should the price of the underlying fall; if the price were to fall all the way to zero, the loss would be as large as the strike price less the option price the seller received. Using a graph, Exhibit 28.3 shows the profit/loss profile for the seller of this put option at the expiration date.

# The Value of an Option

Now we will look at the basic factors that affect the value of an option and discuss a well-known option pricing model.

# Basic Components of the Option Price

The price of an option is a reflection of the option's intrinsic value and any additional amount above its intrinsic value. The premium over intrinsic value is often referred to as the time value.

Intrinsic Value The intrinsic value of an option is its economic value if it is exercised immediately. If no positive economic value would result from exercising the option immediately, then the intrinsic value is zero. For a call option, the intrinsic value is positive if the spot price (i.e., cash market price) of the underlying is greater than the strike price. The intrinsic value is then the difference between the two prices. If the strike price of a call option is greater than or equal to the spot price of the underlying, the intrinsic value is zero. For example, if the strike price for a call option is  $100 and the spot price of the underlying is$ 105, the intrinsic value is $5. That is, an option buyer exercising the option and simultaneously selling the underlying would realize $105 from the sale of the underlying, which would be covered by acquiring the underlying from the option writer for $100, thereby netting a $5 gain.

When an option has intrinsic value, it is said to be in the money (ITM). When the strike price of a call option exceeds the spot price of the underlying, the call option is said to be out of the money (OTM); it has no intrinsic value. An option for which the strike price is equal to the spot price of the underlying is said to be at the money. Both at-the-money and out-of-the-money options have an intrinsic value of zero because they are not profitable to exercise. Our call option with a strike price of $100 would be (1) in the money when the spot price of the underlying is greater than $100, (2) out of the money when the spot price of the underlying is less than $100, and (3) at the money when the spot price of the underlying is equal to $100.

For a put option, the intrinsic value is equal to the amount by which the spot price of the underlying is below the strike price. For example, if the strike price of a put option is $100 and the spot price of the underlying is $92, the intrinsic value is $8. The buyer of the put option who exercises the put option and simultaneously sells the underlying will net $8 by exercising since the underlying will be sold to the writer for $100 and purchased in the market for $92. The intrinsic value is zero if the strike price is less than or equal to the underlying's spot price.

For our put option with a strike price of $100, the option would be (1) in the money when the spot price of the underlying is less than $100, (2) out of the money when the spot price of the underlying exceeds $100, and (3) at the money when the spot price of the underlying is equal to $100.

Time Value The time value of an option is the amount by which the option price exceeds its intrinsic value. The option buyer hopes that, at some time prior to expiration, changes in the market price of the underlying will increase the value of the rights conveyed by the option. For this prospect, the option buyer is willing to pay a premium above the intrinsic value. For example, if the price of a call option with a strike price of $100 is $9 when the spot price of the underlying is $105, the time value of this option is $4 ($9 minus its intrinsic value of $5). Had the current price of the underlying been $90 instead of $105, then the time value of this option would be the entire $9 because the option has no intrinsic value. Other factors being equal, the time value of an option will increase with the amount of time remaining to expiration, since the opportunity for a favorable change in the price of the underlying is greater.

There are two ways in which an option buyer may realize the value of a position taken in an option: the first is to exercise the option, and the second is to sell the option. In the first example above, since the exercise of an option will realize a gain of only  $5 and will cause the immediate loss of any time value ($ 4 in our first example), it is preferable to sell the call. In general, if an option buyer wishes to realize the value of a position, selling will be more economically beneficial than exercising. However, there are circumstances under which it is preferable to exercise prior to the expiration date, depending on whether the total proceeds at the expiration date would be greater by holding the option or by exercising it and reinvesting any cash proceeds received until the expiration date.

# Factors That Influence the Option Price

The following six factors influence the option price:

1. Spot price of the underlying
2. Strike price
3. Time to expiration of the option
4. Expected price volatility of the underlying over the life of the option
5. Short-term risk-free rate over the life of the option
6. Anticipated cash dividends on the underlying stock or index over the life of the option

EXHIBIT 28.4 Summary of Factors that Effect the Price of an American Option

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Factor</td><td colspan="2">Effect of an Increase of Factor on</td></tr><tr><td>Call Price</td><td>Put Price</td></tr><tr><td>Spot price of underlying</td><td>increase</td><td>decrease</td></tr><tr><td>Strike price</td><td>decrease</td><td>increase</td></tr><tr><td>Time to expiration of option</td><td>increase</td><td>increase</td></tr><tr><td>Expected price volatility</td><td>increase</td><td>increase</td></tr><tr><td>Short-term rate</td><td>increase</td><td>decrease</td></tr><tr><td>Anticipated cash dividends</td><td>decrease</td><td>increase</td></tr></table>

The impact of each of these factors depends on whether (1) the option is a call or a put and (2) the option is an American option or a European option. A summary of the effects of each factor on American put and call option prices is presented in Exhibit 28.4.

Notice how the expected price volatility of the underlying over the life of the option affects the price of both a put and a call option. All other factors being equal, the greater the expected volatility (as measured by the standard deviation or variance) of the price of the underlying, the more an investor would be willing to pay for the option, and the more an option writer would demand for it. This is because the greater the volatility, the greater the probability that the price of the underlying will move in favor of the option buyer at some time before expiration.

# Option Pricing Models

Several models have been developed to determine the theoretical value of an option. The most popular one was developed by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in 1973 for valuing European call options. Several modifications to their model have followed since then. We discuss this model here to give the reader a feel for the impact of the factors on the price of an option.

By imposing certain assumptions and using arbitrage arguments, the Black-Scholes option pricing model provides the fair (or theoretical) price of a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock. Basically, the idea behind the arbitrage argument in deriving this and other option pricing models is that if the payoff from owning a call option can be replicated by (1) purchasing the stock underlying the call option and (2) borrowing funds, then the price of the option will be (at most) the cost of creating the replicating strategy.

The formula for the Black-Scholes model is

$$
C = S N (d _ {1}) - X e ^ {- r t} N (d _ {2})
$$ where


$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (S / K) + (r + 0 . 5 s ^ {2}) t}{s \sqrt {t}}
$$

$d_{2} = d_{1} - s\sqrt{t}$

$\ln =$  natural logarithm

C = call option price

$S =$  price of the underlying

$K =$  strike price

$r =$  short-term risk-free rate

$e = 2.718$  (natural antilog of 1)

$t =$  time remaining to the expiration date (measured as a fraction of a year)

$s =$  standard deviation of the change in stock price

$N(\cdot) =$  the cumulative probability density2

Notice that five of the factors that we said earlier in this chapter influence the price of an option are included in the formula. However, the sixth factor, anticipated cash dividends, is not included because the model is for a non-dividend-paying stock. In the Black-Scholes model, the direction of the influence of each of these factors is the same as stated earlier. Four of the factors—strike price, price of underlying, time to expiration, and risk-free rate—are easily observed. The standard deviation of the price of the underlying must be estimated.

The option price derived from the Black-Scholes model is "fair" in the sense that if any other price existed, it would be possible to earn riskless arbitrage profits by taking an offsetting position in the underlying. That is, if the price of the call option in the market is higher than that derived from the Black-Scholes model, an investor could sell the call option and buy a certain quantity of the underlying. If the reverse is true, that is, the market price of the call option is less than the "fair" price derived from the model, the investor could buy the call option and sell short a certain amount of the underlying. This process of hedging by taking a position in the underlying allows the investor to lock in the riskless arbitrage profit. The number of shares necessary to hedge the position changes as the factors that affect the option price change, so the hedged position must be changed constantly.

To illustrate the Black-Scholes model, assume the following values:

Strike price = $45

Time remaining to expiration  $= 183$  days

Spot stock price = $47

Expected price volatility = standard deviation = 25\%

Risk-free rate  $= 10\%$

In terms of the values in the formula:

S = 47

K = 45

$\mathrm{t} = 0.5$  (183 days/365, rounded) s = 0.25

r = 0.10

Substituting these values into the equations presented earlier, we get

$$ d _ {1} = \frac {\ln (4 7 / 4 5) + [ 0 . 1 0 + 0 . 5 (0 . 2 5) ^ {2} ] 0 . 5}{0 . 2 5 \sqrt {0 . 5}} = 0. 6 1 7 2
$$

$$ d _ {2} = 0. 6 1 7 2 - 0. 2 5 \sqrt {0 . 5} = 0. 4 4 0 4
$$

From a normal distribution table:

$$
N (0. 6 1 7 2) = 0. 7 3 1 5 \text {a n d} N (0. 4 4 0 4) = 0. 6 7 0 2
$$

Then:

$$
C = 4 7 (0. 7 3 1 5) - 4 5 \left(e ^ {- (0. 1 0) (0. 5)}\right) (0. 6 7 0 2) = \$ 5. 6 9
$$

Exhibit 28.5 shows the option value as calculated from the Black-Scholes model for different assumptions concerning (1) the standard deviation, (2) the risk-free rate, and (3) the time remaining to expiration. Notice that the option price varies directly with all three factors. That is, (1) the lower (higher) the volatility, the lower (higher) the option price; (2) the lower (higher) the risk-free rate, the lower (higher) the option price; and, (3) the shorter (longer) the time remaining to expiration, the lower (higher) the option price. All of this agrees with what is shown in Exhibit 28.4 about the effect of a change in one of the factors on the price of a call option.

How do we determine the value of put options? There is a relationship among the spot price of the underlying, the call option price, and the put option price. This is called the put-call parity relationship. If we can calculate the fair value of a call option, the fair value of a put with the same strike price and expiration on the same stock can be calculated from the put-call parity relationship.

# Sensitivity of the Option Price to a Change in Factors

In employing options in investment strategies, a manager would like to know how sensitive the price of an option is to a change in any one of the factors that affect its price. Let's discuss the sensitivity of a call option's price to changes in the price of the underlying, the time to expiration, and expected price volatility.

The Call Option Price and the Price of the Underlying A manager employing options for risk management wants to know how the option position will change as the price of the underlying changes. The measure that estimates this sensitivity is an option's delta . This measure indicates the approximate change in the value of an option for a 1 change in the price of the underlying stock. Delta is measured as follows:

$$
\text {D e l t a} = \frac {\text {C h a n g e i n p r i c e o f c a l l o p t i o n}}{\text {C h a n g e i n p r i c e o f u n d e r l y i n g}}
$$

For example, a delta of 0.4 means that a  $1 change in the price of the underlying stock will change the price of the call option by approximately$ 0.40.

The delta for a call option varies from zero (for call options deep out of the money) to 1 (for call options deep in the money). The delta for a call option at the money is approximately 0.5.

The Call Option Price and Time to Expiration All other factors being constant, the longer the time to expiration, the greater the option price. Since each day the option moves closer to the expiration date, the time to expiration decreases. The theta of an option measures the change in the option price as the time to expiration decreases, or equivalently, it is a measure of time decay. Theta is measured as follows:

$$
\text {T h e t a} = \frac {\text {C h a n g e i n p r i c e o f o p t i o n}}{\text {D e c r e a s e i n t i m e t o e x p i r a t i o n}}
$$

Assuming that the price of the underlying does not change (which means that the intrinsic value of the option does not change), theta measures how quickly the time value of the option changes as the option moves toward expiration. Buyers of options prefer a low theta so that the option price does not decline quickly as it moves toward the expiration date. An option writer benefits from an option that has a high theta.

The Call Option Price and Expected Price Volatility All other factors being constant, a change in the expected price volatility will change the option price. The vega (also called kappa) of an option measures the dollar price change in the price of the option for a  $1\%$  change in the expected price volatility. That is,

$$
\mathrm{Vega} = \frac{\text{Change in option price}}{1\% \text{change in expected price volatility}}
$$

# FUTURES CONTRACTS

A futures contract is an agreement between two parties, a buyer and a seller, where the parties agree to transact with respect to the underlying at a predetermined price at a specified date. Both parties are obligated to perform over the life of the contract, and neither party charges a fee. Once the two parties have consummated the trade, the exchange where the futures contract is traded becomes the counterparty to the trade, thereby severing the relationship between the initial parties.

Each futures contract is accompanied by an exact description of the terms of the contract, including a description of the underlying, the contract size, settlement cycles, trading specifications, and position limits. The fact is that in the case of futures contracts, delivery is not the objective of either party because the contracts are used primarily to manage risk or costs.

The nature of the futures contract specifies a buyer and a seller who agree to buy or sell a standard quantity of the underlying at a designated future date. However, when we speak of buyers and sellers, we are simply adopting the language of the futures market, which refers to parties of the contract in terms of the future obligation they are committing themselves to. The buyer of a futures contract agrees to take delivery of the underlying and is said to be long futures. Long futures positions benefit when the price of the underlying rises. Since futures can be considered a substitute for a subsequent transaction in the cash market, a long futures position is comparable to holding the underlying without the financial cost of purchasing the underlying or the income that comes from holding the under lying. The seller, on the other hand, is said to be short futures and benefits when the price of the underlying declines.

The designated price at which the parties agree to transact is called the futures price. The designated date at which the parties must transact is the settlement date or delivery date. Unlike options, no money changes hands between buyer and seller at the contract's inception. However, the futures broker and the futures exchange require initial margin as a "good faith" deposit. In addition, a minimum amount of funds referred to as maintenance margin is required to be maintained in the corresponding futures account. The initial margin and the maintenance margin can be held in the form of short-term credit instruments.

Futures are marked-to-the-market on a daily basis. This means that daily gains or losses in the investor's position are accounted for immediately and reflected in his or her account. The daily cash flow from a futures position is called variation margin and essentially means that the futures contract is settled daily. Thus, the buyer of the futures contract pays when the price of the underlying falls and the seller pays when the price of the underlying rises. Variation margin differs from other forms of margin because outflows must be met with cash.

Futures contracts have a settlement cycle and there may be several contracts trading simultaneously. The contract with the closest settlement is called the nearby futures contract and is usually the most liquid. The next futures contract is the one that settles just after the near contract. The contract with the furthest away settlement is called the most distant futures contract.

# Differences between Options and Futures

The fundamental difference between futures and options is that buyer of an option (the long position) has the right but not the obligation to enter into a transaction. The option writer is obligated to transact if the buyer so desires. In contrast, both parties are obligated to perform in the case of a futures contract. In addition, to establish a position, the party who is long futures does not pay the party who is short futures. In contrast, the party long an option must make a payment to the party who is short the option in order to establish the position. The price paid is the option price.

The payout structure also differs between a futures contract and an options contract. The price of an option contract represents the cost of eliminating or modifying the risk/reward relationship of the underlying. In contrast, the payout for a futures contract is a dollar-for-dollar gain or loss for the buyer and seller. When the futures price rises, the buyer gains at the expense of the seller, while the buyer suffers a dollar-for-dollar loss when the futures price drops.

Thus, futures payout is symmetrical, while the payout for options is skewed. The maximum loss for the option buyer is the option price. The loss to the futures buyer is the full value of the contract. The option buyer has limited downside losses but retains the benefits of an increase in the value in the position of the underlying. The maximum profit that can be realized by the option writer is the option price, which is offset by significant downside exposure. The losses or gains to the buyer and seller of a futures contract are completely symmetrical. Consequently, futures can be used as a hedge against symmetric risk, while options can be used to hedge asymmetric risk.

# Features of Futures

The key elements of a futures contract include the futures price, the amount or quantity of the underlying, and the settlement or delivery date. The underlying asset of a stock index futures contract is the portfolio of stocks represented by the index.

The value of the underlying portfolio is the value of the index in a specified currency times a number called a multiplier. For example, if the current value of the S&P 500 index is 1100, then the seller of a December S&P 500 futures contract is theoretically obligated to deliver in December a portfolio of the 500 stocks that comprise the index. The multiplier for this contract is 500. The portfolio would have to exactly replicate the index with the weights of the stocks equal to their index weights. The current value of one futures contract is  $275,000 (= 1100 \times 250)$ .

However, because of the problems associated with delivering a portfolio of 500 stocks that exactly replicate the underlying index, stock index futures substitute cash delivery for physical delivery. At final settlement, the futures price equals the spot price and the value of a futures contract is the actual market value of the underlying replicating portfolio that represents the stock index. The contract is marked-to-market based on the settlement price, which is the spot price, and the contract settles.

Exhibit 28.6 provides a list of selected stock index futures traded in the United States.

# Pricing Stock Index Futures

Futures contracts are priced based on the spot price and cost of carry considerations. For equity contracts these include the cost of financing a position in the underlying asset, the dividend yield on the underlying stocks, and the time to settlement of the futures contract. The theoretical futures price is derived from the spot price adjusted for the cost of carry. This can be confirmed using risk-free arbitrage arguments.

The logic of the pricing model is that the purchase of a futures contract can be looked at as a temporary substitute for a transaction in the cash market at a later date. Moreover, futures contracts are not assets to be purchased and no money changes hands when the agreement is made. Futures contracts are agreements between two parties that establish the terms of a later transaction. It is these facts that lead us to a pricing relationship between futures contracts and the underlying. The seller of a futures contract is ultimately responsible for delivering the underlying and will demand compensation for incurring the cost of holding it. Thus, the futures price will reflect the cost of financing the underlying. However, the buyer of the futures contract does not hold the underlying and therefore does not receive the dividend. The futures price must be adjusted downward to take this into consideration. The adjustment of the yield for the cost of financing is what is called the net cost of carry. The futures price is then based on the net cost of carry, which is the cost of financing adjusted for the yield on the underlying. That is,

Futures price  $=$  Spot price + Cost of financing - Dividend yield

The borrowing or financing rate is an interest rate on a money market instrument and the yield in the case of stock index futures is the dividend yield on a portfolio of stocks that represent the stock index. The theoretical futures price derived from this process is a model of the fair value of the futures contract. It is the price that defines a no-arbitrage condition. The no-arbitrage condition is the futures price at which sellers are prepared to sell and buyers are prepared to buy, but no risk-free profit is possible.

The theoretical futures price expressed mathematically depends on the treatment of dividends. For individual equities with quarterly dividend payout, the theoretical futures price can be expressed as the spot price adjusted for the present value of expected dividends over the life of the contract and the cost of financing. The expression is given below as:

$$
F (t, T) = [ S (t) - D ] \times [ 1 + R (t, T) ]
$$ where


$F(t,T) =$  futures price at time  $t$  for a contract that settles in the future at time  $T$

$S(t)$ $=$  current spot price

$D$  = present value of dividends expected to be received over the life of the contract

$R(t,T) =$  borrowing rate for a loan with the same time to maturity as the futures settlement date

For example, if the current price of the S&P 500 stock index is 1175, the borrowing rate is  $6\%$ , the time to settlement is 60 days, and the index is expected to yield  $2.071\%$ . An annualized dividend yield of  $2.071\%$  corresponds to 4 index points when the S&P 500 stock index is 1175:

$$

1 1 7 5 \times [ 0. 0 2 0 7 1 \times (6 0 / 3 6 5) ] = 4 \text {i n d e x p o i n t s}

$$

The theoretical futures price can be calculated as follows:

$$

D = 4 / (1 + 0. 0 6) ^ {6 0 / 3 6 5} = 3. 9 6

$$

$$

R = (1 + 0.06)^{60 / 365} - 1 = 0.009624 \text {or} 0.9624 \%

$$

$$

F (t, 6 0) = [ 1 1 7 5 - 3. 9 6 ] \times 1. 0 0 9 6 2 4 = 1 1 8 2. 3 1

$$

If the actual futures price is above or below 1182.31, then risk-free arbitrage is possible. For actual futures prices greater than fair value, the futures contract is overvalued. Arbitrageurs will sell the futures contract, borrow enough funds to purchase the underlying stock index, and hold the position until fair value is restored or until the settlement date of the futures contract.


If, for example, we assume the actual futures price is 1188, then the following positions would lead to risk-free arbitrage:

■ sell the overvalued futures at 1188 borrow an amount equivalent to 1175
■ purchase a stock portfolio that replicates the index for the equivalent of 1175

The position can be unwound at the settlement date in 60 days at no risk to the arbitrageur. At the settlement date, the futures settlement price equals the spot price. Assume the spot price is unchanged at 1175. Then, collect 4 in dividends

■ settle the short futures position by delivering the index to the buyer for 1175 repay 1186.31 (1175 × 1.009624) to satisfy the loan (remember the interest rate for the 60 days is  $0.9624\%$ )

The net gain is  $[1188 + 4] - 1186.31 = 5.69$ . That is, the arbitrageur "earned" 5.69 index points or 48 basis points (5.69/1175) without risk or without making any investment. This activity would continue until the price of the futures converged on fair value.

It does not matter what the settlement price for the index is at the settlement date. This can be clearly shown by treating the futures position and stock position separately. The futures position delivers the difference between the original futures price and the settlement price or 1188 - 1175, which equals 13 index points. The long stock position earned only the dividends and no capital gain. The cost of financing the position in the stock is 11.31 and the net return to the combined short futures and long stock position is  $13(\text{futures}) + 4(\text{stock})$  less the 11.31 cost of financing, which is a net return of 5.69. Now consider what happens if the spot price is at any other level at the settlement date. Exhibit 28.7 shows the cash flows associated with the arbitrage. We can see from the results that regardless of the movement of the spot price, the arbitrage profit is preserved.

For actual futures prices less than fair value, the futures contract is undervalued. Arbitrageurs will buy the futures contract, short or sell the underlying, lend the proceeds, and hold the position until fair value is restored or until settlement date of the futures contract. If, for example, we assume the actual futures price is 1180, then the following positions would lead to risk-free arbitrage: buy the undervalued futures at 1180

■ sell or short the stock index at 1175 and collect the proceeds
■ lend the proceeds from the stock transaction at  $6 \%$

Once again the position can be unwound at the settlement date at no risk to the arbitrageur. At that time the futures settlement price equals the spot price. Regardless of the settlement price of the index, the arbitrage is preserved in this case as well. Exhibit 28.7 presents a sample of settlement price outcomes. The following process applies to the arbitrage regardless of the direction of the stock market:

■ settle the short stock position by taking futures delivery of the stock index pay the 4 index points in dividends due the index
receive the proceeds from the loan (remember the term interest rate is  $0.9624\%$ )

Buy futures at 1180

In this example, the arbitrageur "earned" 20 basis points (2.31/ 1175) or 2.31 index points without risk or without making any investment. This activity would continue until the price of the futures converged on fair value.

The theoretical futures price can also be expressed mathematically based on a security with a known dividend yield. For equities that pay out a constant dividend over the life of a futures contract, this rendition of the model is appropriate. This may apply to stock index futures contracts where the underlying is an equity index of a large number of stocks. Rather than calculating every dividend, the cumulative dividend payout or the weighted-average dividend produces a constant and known dividend yield. The cost of carry valuation model is modified to reflect the behavior of dividends. This is expressed in the following equation:

$$

F (t, T) = S (t) \times [ 1 + R (t, T) - Y (t, T) ]

$$ where  $Y(t,T)$  is the dividend yield on the underlying over the life of the futures contract and  $F(t,T), S(t)$ , and  $R(t,T)$  are as defined earlier.

For example, if the current price of a stock is 1175, the borrowing rate is  $6\%$ , the time to settlement is 60 days, and the annualized dividend yield is  $1.38\%$ , the theoretical futures price can be calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} Y = (1 + 0.0138)^{60 / 365} - 1 = 0.002256 \text{or} 0.2256\% \\ R = (1 + 0.06)^{60 / 365} - 1 = 0.009624 \text{or} 0.9624 \% \\ \mathrm {F} (t, 6 0) = 1 1 7 5 \times [ 1 + (0. 0 0 9 6 2 4 - 0. 0 0 2 2 5 6 ] = 1 1 8 3. 6 6 \\ \end{array}
$$

In practice, it is important to remember to use the borrowing rate and dividend yield for the term of the contract and not the annual rates. The arbitrage conditions outlined above still hold in this case. The model is specified differently, but the same outcome is possible. When the actual futures price deviates from the theoretical price suggested by the futures pricing model, arbitrage would be possible and likely. The existence of risk-free arbitrage profits will attract arbitrageurs.

In practice, there are several factors that may violate the assumptions of the futures valuation model. Because of these factors, arbitrage must be carried out with some degree of uncertainty and the fair value futures price is not a single price, but actually a range of prices where the upper and lower prices act as boundaries around an arbitrage-free zone. Furthermore, the violation of various assumptions can produce mispricing and risk that reduce arbitrage opportunities.

The futures price ought to gravitate toward fair value when there is a viable and active arbitrage mechanism. Arbitrage activity will only take place beyond the upper and lower limits established by transaction and other costs, uncertain cash flows, and divergent borrowing and lending rates among participants. The variability of the spread between the spot price and futures price, known as the basis, is a consequence of mispricing due to changes in the variables that influence the fair value.

The practical aspects of pricing produce a range of prices. This means that the basis can move around without offering a profit motive for arbitrageurs. The perspective of arbitrageurs in the equity futures markets is based on dollar profit but can be viewed in terms of an interest rate. The borrowing or financing rate found in the cost of carry valuation formula assuming borrowing and lending rates are the same. In practice, however, borrowing rates are almost always higher than lending rates. Thus, the model will yield different values depending on the respective borrowing and lending rates facing the user. Every futures price corresponds to an interest rate. We can manipulate the formula and solve for the rate implied by the futures price, which is called the implied futures rate. For each market participant there is a theoretical fair value range defined by its respective borrowing and lending rates and transaction costs.

# OTC EQUITY DERIVATIVES

An OTC equity derivative can be delivered on a stand-alone basis or as part of a structured product. Structured products involve packaging standard or exotic options, equity swaps, or equity-linked debt into a single product in any combination to meet the risk/return objectives of the investor and may represent an alternative to the cash market even when cash instruments are available.

The three basic components of OTC equity derivatives are OTC options, equity swaps, and equity-linked debt. These components offer an array of product structures that can assist investors in developing and implementing investment strategies that respond to a changing financial world. The rapidly changing investment climate has fundamentally changed investor attitudes toward the use of derivative products. It is no longer a question of what can an investor gain from the use of OTC derivatives, but how much is sacrificed by avoiding this marketplace. OTC derivatives can assist the investor with cost minimization, diversification, hedging, asset allocation, and risk management.

Before we provide a product overview, let's look at counterparty risk. For exchange listed derivative products, counterparty or credit risk is minimal because of the clearing house associated with the exchange. However, for OTC products there is counterparty risk. For parties taking a position where performance of both parties is required, both parties are exposed to counterparty risk. The OTC market has incorporated a variety of terms into the contractual agreement between counterparties to address the issue of credit risk. These include netting arrangements, position limits, the use of collateral, recouoning, credit triggers, and the establishment of Derivatives Product Companies (DPCs).

Netting arrangements between counterparties are used in master agreements specifying that in the event of default, the bottom line is the net payment owed across all contractual agreements between the two counterparties. Position limits may be imposed on a particular counterparty according to the cumulative nature of their positions and creditworthiness. As the OTC market has grown, the creditworthiness of customers has become more diverse. Consequently, dealers are requiring some counterparties to furnish collateral in the form of a liquid short-term credit instrument. Recouponing involves periodically changing the coupon such that the marked-to-market value of the position is zero. For long-term OTC agreements, a credit trigger provision allows the dealer to have the position cash settled if the counterparty's credit rating falls below investment grade. Finally, dealers are establishing DPCs as separate business entities to maintain high credit ratings that are crucial in competitively pricing OTC products.

# OTC Options

OTC options can be classified as first generation and second generation options. The latter are called exotic options. We describe each type of OTC option in the following sections.

# First Generation of OTC Options

The basic type of first generation OTC options either extends the standardized structure of an existing listed option or creates an option on stocks, stock baskets, or stock indexes without listed options or futures. Thus, OTC options were first used to modify one or more of the features of listed options: the strike price, maturity, size, exercise type (American or European), and delivery mechanism. The terms were tailored to the specific needs of the investor. For example, the strike price can be any level; the maturity date at any time; the contract of any size; the exercise type American or European; the underlying can be a stock, a stock portfolio, or an equity index or a foreign equity index; and the settlement can be physical, in cash, or a combination.

An example of how OTC options can differ from listed options is exemplified by an Asian option. Listed options are either European or American in structure relating to the timing of exercise. Asian options are options with a payout that is dependent on the average price of the spot price over the life of the option. Due to the averaging process involved, the volatility of the spot price is reduced. Thus, Asian options are cheaper than similar European or American options.

The first generation of OTC options offered flexible solutions to investment situations that listed options did not. For example, hedging strategies using the OTC market allow the investor to achieve customized total risk protection for a specific time horizon. The first generation of OTC options allow investors to fine tune their traditional equity investment strategies through customizing strike prices and maturities, and choosing any underlying equity security or portfolio of securities. Investors could now improve the management of risk through customized hedging strategies or enhance returns through customized buy writes. In addition, investors could invest in foreign stocks without the need to own them, and profit from an industry downturn without the need to short stocks.

# Exotics: Second Generation OTC Options

The second generation of OTC equity options includes a set of products that have more complex payoff characteristics than standard American or European call and put options. These second-generation options are sometimes referred to as "exotic" options and are essentially options with specific rules that govern the payoff. Exotic option structures can be created on a stand-alone basis or as part of a broader financing package such as an attachment to a bond issue.

Some OTC option structures are path dependent, which means that the value of the option to some extent depends on the price pattern of the underlying asset over the life of the option. In fact, the survival of some options, such as barrier options, depends on this price pattern. Other examples of path dependent options include Asian options, lookback options, and reset options. Another group of OTC option structures has properties similar to step functions. They have fixed singular payoffs when a particular condition is met. Examples of this include digital or binary options and contingent options. A third group of options is classified as multivariate because the payoff is related to more than one underlying asset. Examples of this group include a general category of rainbow options such as spread options and basket options.

Competitive market makers are now prepared to offer investors a broad range of derivative products that satisfy the specific requirements of investors. The fastest growing portion of this market pertaining to equities involves products with option-like characteristics on major stock indexes or stock portfolios.

# Equity Swaps

Equity swaps are agreements between two counterparties which provide for the periodic exchange of a schedule of cash flows over a specified time period where at least one of the two payments is linked to the performance of an equity index, a basket of stocks, or a single stock. In a standard or plain vanilla equity swap, one counterparty agrees to pay the other the total return to an equity index in exchange for receiving either the total return of another asset or a fixed or floating interest rate. All payments are based on a fixed notional amount and payments are made over a fixed time period.

Equity swap structures are very flexible with maturities ranging from a few months to 10 years. The returns of virtually any asset can be swapped for another without incurring the costs associated with a transaction in the cash market. Payment schedules can be denominated in any currency irrespective of the equity asset and payments can be exchanged monthly, quarterly, annually, or at maturity. The equity asset can be any equity index or portfolio of stocks, and denominated in any currency, hedged or unhedged.

Variations of the plain vanilla equity swap include: international equity swaps where the equity return is linked to an international equity index; currency-hedged swaps where the swap is structured to eliminate currency risk; and call swaps where the equity payment is paid only if the equity index appreciates (depreciation will not result in a payment from the counterparty receiving the equity return to the other counterparty because of call protection).

A basic swap structure is illustrated in Exhibit 28.8. In this case, the investor owns a short-term credit instrument that yields LIBOR plus a spread. The investor then enters into a swap to exchange LIBOR plus the spread for the total return to an equity index. The counterparty pays the total return to the index in exchange for LIBOR plus a spread. Assuming the equity index is the Nikkei 225, a U.S. investor could swap dollar-denominated LIBOR plus a spread for cash flows from the total return to the Nikkei denominated in yen or U.S. dollars. The index could be any foreign or domestic equity index. A swap could also be structured to generate superior returns if the financing instrument in the swap yields a higher return than LIBOR.

EXHIBIT 28.8 Equity Swaps

Equity swaps have a wide variety of applications including asset allocation, accessing international markets, enhancing equity returns, hedging equity exposure, and synthetically shorting stocks.

An example of an equity swap is a 1-year agreement where the counterparty agrees to pay the investor the total return to the S&P 500 Index in exchange for dollar-denominated LIBOR on a quarterly basis. The investor would pay LIBOR plus a spread  $\times 91 / 360 \times$  notional amount. This type of equity swap is the economic equivalent of financing a long position in the S&P 500 Index at a spread to LIBOR. The advantages of using the swap are no transaction costs, no sales or dividend withholding tax, and no tracking error or basis risk versus the index.

The basic mechanics of equity swaps are the same regardless of the structure. However, the rules governing the exchange of payments may differ. For example, a U.S. investor wanting to diversify internationally can enter into a swap and, depending on the investment objective, exchange payments on a currency-hedged basis. If the investment objective is to reduce U.S. equity exposure and increase Japanese equity exposure, for example, a swap could be structured to exchange the total returns to the S&P 500 Index for the total returns to the Nikkei 225 Index. If, however, the investment objective is to gain access to the Japanese equity market, a swap can be structured to exchange LIBOR plus a spread for the total returns to the Nikkei 225 Index. This is an example of diversifying internationally and the cash flows can be denominated in either yen or dollars. The advantages of entering into an equity swap to obtain international diversification are that the investor exposure is devoid of tracking error, and the investor incurs no sales tax, custodial fees, withholding fees, or market impact associated with entering and exiting a market. This swap is the economic equivalent of being long the Nikkei 225 financed at a spread to LIBOR at a fixed exchange rate.
