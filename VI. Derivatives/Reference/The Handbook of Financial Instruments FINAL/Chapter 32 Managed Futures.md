# Managed Futures in Agricultural Commodities

In our discussion of commodity futures in Chapter 10, we indicated that commodity prices are more likely to be susceptible to positive price surprises. The reason is that most of the news associated with agricultural products is usually negative. Droughts, floods, storms, and crop freezes are the main news stories. Therefore, new information to the agricultural market tends to result in positive price shocks instead of negative price shocks. (There is not much price reaction to the news that "the crop cycle is progressing normally.") We would expect the CTAs to capture the advantage of these price surprises and any trends that develop from them.

Exhibit 32.2 presents the return distribution for Barclays Agricultural CTA index. We use data over the period 1990-2000. From a quick review of this distribution, it closely resembles a bell curve type of distribution. However, in Exhibit 32.6, we show that this distribution in fact has a positive skew of 0.18. Therefore, compared to the negative skew observed for the passive MLMI, we can conclude that managed futures did add value compared to a passive strategy.

In addition, the value of kurtosis, while still positive at 0.69, is much smaller than that for the MLMI. In fact, the tails of the distribution for the Barclays Agricultural CTA index have probability mass close to that for a normal distribution. Therefore, CTAs were able to shift the distribution of commodity futures returns from a negative skew to a positive skew while reducing the exposure to tail risk.

EXHIBIT 32.3 Barclays Currency CTA Returns

Unfortunately, there is a tradeoff for this skill. The average return to the Barclays Agricultural CTA index of  $0.58\%$  per month is less than that for the MLMI index of  $0.73\%$ . Additionally, the Sharpe ratio for the managed futures strategy is lower than that for the MLMI. Consequently, the results for managed futures trading in the agriculture markets is mixed. On the one hand, we observe a positive shift to the distribution of returns, but on the other, a reduction in the risk and return tradeoff as measured by the Sharpe ratio.

# Managed Futures in Currency Markets

The currency markets are the most liquid and efficient markets in the world. The reason is simple, every other commodity, financial asset, household good, cheeseburger, and so on must be denominated in a currency. As the numeraire, currency is the commodity in which all other commodities and assets are denominated.

Daily trading volume in exchange-listed and forward markets for currency contracts is in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Given the liquidity, depth, and efficiency of the currency markets, we would expect the ability of managed futures traders to derive value to be small.

Exhibit 32.3 provides the distribution of returns for actively managed currency futures. We can see from this graph and later in Exhibit 32.6, that CTAs produced a distribution of returns with a very large positive skew of 1.39. This is considerably greater than that for the MLMI, and presents a strong case for skill. In addition, the average monthly return for CTAs trading in currency futures is  $0.8\%$  per month, an improvement of the average monthly return for the MLMI.

Unfortunately, this strategy also provides a higher value of kurtosis, 3.15, indicating significant exposure to outlier events. This higher exposure to outlier events translates into a higher standard deviation of returns for managed currency futures, and a lower Sharpe ratio.

The evidence for skill-based investing in managed currency futures is mixed. On the one hand, CTAs demonstrated an ability to shift the distribution of returns compared to a naive trend following strategy from negative to positive. On the other hand, more risk was incurred through greater exposure to outlier events resulting in a lower Sharpe ratio than that for the MLMI.

# Managed Futures in the Financials and Metals Markets

As we discussed, with the advent of the GNMA futures contract in the 1970s, financial futures contracts have enjoyed greater prominence than traditional physical commodity futures. However, considerable liquidity exists in the precious metals markets because gold, silver, and platinum are still purchased and sold primarily as a store of value rather than for any productive input into a manufacturing process. In this fashion, precious metal futures resemble financial assets.

Financial assets tend to have a negative skew of returns during the period 1990-2000 with a reasonably large value of leptokurtosis. Therefore, a demonstration of skill with respect to managed futures is again the ability to shift the distribution of returns to a positive skew.

Exhibits 32.4 and 32.5 demonstrate this positive skew. Managed futures in financial and precious metal futures have a positive skew of 0.58 and a small positive kurtosis of 0.49. Therefore, CTAs were able to shift the distribution of returns to the upside while reducing exposure to outlier returns.

The average monthly return, however, is  $0.63\%$ , less than that for the MLMI. Additionally, the Sharpe ratio for this CTA strategy is less than that for the MLMI. Once again, we find mixed evidence that managed futures can add value beyond that presented in a mechanical trend following strategy.

# Managed Futures in the Energy Markets

The energy markets are chock full of price shocks associated with news events. These news events tend to be positive for the price of energy related commodities and futures contracts thereon. The Arab Oil Embargo in 1973 and 1977, the Iraq/Iran war of the early 1980s, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, as well as sudden cold snaps, broken pipelines, oil refinery fires and explosions, and oil tanker shipwrecks all tend to increase the price of oil and oil related products.

If there is skill in the managed futures industry with respect to energy futures contracts, we would expect to see a positively skewed distribution with a large expected return. In addition, we would expect to see a large value of kurtosis that reflects the exposure to these outlier events.

Exhibits 32.5 and 32.6 present the results for managed futures in the energy markets.[17] The results are consistent with our expectations for skew and kurtosis. CTAs did manage to produce a positively skewed distribution of returns. Additionally, a large value of leptokurtosis is observed, consistent with the energy price shocks that affect this market in particular.

Yet, the average return for managed futures in the energy markets is a  $-0.06\%$  per month. Therefore, even though CTAs are able to shift the distribution of returns to a positive skew, the distribution is centered around a negative mean return. While a positive skew to a distribution is a favorable characteristic of any asset class, it has no utility to an investor if the asset class still loses money. Therefore, we must conclude that managed futures in the energy markets did little to add value for an investor.

Given the mixed and disappointing results observed in Exhibits 32.2 through 32.6, we explore another possible use for managed futures: downside risk protection. We examine this prospect in the next section.

# MANAGED FUTURES AS DOWNSIDE RISK PROTECTION FOR STOCKS AND BONDS

The greatest concern for any investor is downside risk. If equity and bond markets are becoming increasingly synchronized, international diversification may not offer the protection sought by investors. The ability to protect the value of an investment portfolio in hostile or turbulent markets is the key to the value of any macroeconomic diversification.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/34152bb9-0c82-464c-8d95-33ab992e7f99/2edc2c6cf8ce86739eb8847d436e1f45bf23136c348a6c06564c03af66b7f3ed.jpg)

EXHIBIT 32.7 Frequency Distribution, 60/40 Stocks/Bonds

Within this framework, an asset class distinct from financial assets has the potential to diversify and protect an investment portfolio from hostile markets. It is possible that "skill-based" strategies such as managed futures investing can provide the diversification that investors seek. Managed futures strategies might provide diversification for a stock and bond portfolio because the returns are dependent upon the special skill of the CTA rather than any macroeconomic policy decisions made by central bankers or government regimes.

Exhibit 32.7 presents the return distribution for a portfolio that was  $60\%$  the S&P 500 and  $40\%$  U.S. Treasury bonds. Our concern is the shaded part of the return distribution. This shows where the returns to the stock and bond portfolios were negative. That is, the shaded part of the distribution shows both the size and the frequency with which the combined return of  $60\%$  S&P 500 plus  $40\%$  U.S. Treasury bonds earned a negative return in a particular month. The average monthly return in the shaded part of the distribution was  $-2.07\%$ . It is this part of the return distribution that an investor attempts to avoid or limit.

We attempt to protect against the downside of this distribution by making a  $10\%$  allocation to managed futures to our initial stock and bond portfolio. Therefore, the new portfolio is a blend of  $55\%$  S&P 500,  $35\%$  U.S. Treasury bonds, and  $10\%$  managed futures. If managed futures can protect against downside risk, we can conclude that it is a valuable addition to a stock and bond portfolio.

EXHIBIT 32.8 55/35/10 Stocks/Bonds/CTA Agriculture

Once again, we use the MLMI as a benchmark to determine if CTAs can improve the downside protection over a passive trend following strategy. The MLMI provided 19 basis points of downside protection for stocks and bonds. Therefore, to demonstrate special skill (and to earn their fees), CTAs in managed futures products must provide greater than 19 basis points of downside risk protection.

Exhibit 32.8 presents the return distribution for a 55/35/10 stock/ bond/CTA agriculture portfolio. Exhibit 32.12 presents summary statistics for this portfolio. The average downside return in the shaded part of Exhibit 32.8 is  $-1.81\%$ . This is an improvement of 26 basis points over the shaded downside area presented in Exhibit 32.7. We can conclude that CTAs managing futures in the agricultural sector did, in fact, exhibit skill by providing additional downside protection beyond that offered by the passive MLMI.

In Exhibit 32.10 we show that this downside protection came at the expense of 3 basis points per month of expected return. Given that, on average, the  $60/40$  stock/bond portfolio experiences 3.8 downside months per year, the annual expected tradeoff is  $(26\mathrm{bp}\times 3.8) - (3\mathrm{bp}\times 12) = 63$  basis points.

Exhibit 32.9 presents the return distribution for a 55/35/10 stocks/bonds/CTA currency portfolio. This portfolio also provides downside protection to a stock and bond portfolio. The average monthly downside return is  $-1.96\%$ . Therefore, currency managed futures provided  $0.11\%$  of average monthly downside risk protection. This is less than provided by the MLMI, and consequently, CTAs in this sector did not demonstrate additional skill with respect to downside protection.

In Exhibit 32.10 we present the portfolio return distribution with a  $10\%$  allocation to CTA managed futures in financial and metal futures contracts. The average monthly downside return of this portfolio is  $-1.95\%$ , indicating an improvement of  $0.12\%$  per month over the standard stock and bond portfolio. However, again, this is less than the protection offered by the MLMI, and CTA skill is not apparent.

EXHIBIT 32.11 55/35/10 Stocks/Bonds/CTA Energy

Last, Exhibit 32.11 presents the return distribution for a 55/35/10 stock/bond/CTA energy portfolio. The average monthly downside return in this portfolio is  $-1.86\%$ , an improvement of 21 basis points over that for stocks and bonds alone. This outperforms the downside risk protection offered by the MLMI.

Once again, we cannot provide firm support for the managed futures industry. Although all managed futures strategies provided downside protection to a stock and bond portfolio, only two strategies (agriculture and energy futures trading) outperformed the downside protection provided by the passive trend following strategy represented by the MLMI. CTAs trading currency and financial products offered less downside protection than that provided by the MLMI. Perhaps currency and financial futures are sufficiently linked to financial assets that they offer less downside protection. In any event, our conclusion regarding the diversification potential of managed futures products is unsettled.

These results are summarized in the first panel of Exhibit 32.12 where we present average downside return compared to the 60/40 stock/bond portfolio as well as the expected returns, standard deviations, and Sharpe ratios for the four portfolios containing managed futures products. We also present the same information for the 55/35/10 stock/bond/MLMI portfolio.

In each case, a portfolio with a  $10\%$  allocation to managed futures provided a higher Sharpe ratio than that for the 60/40 stock/bond portfolio. This highlights the concept that managed futures products cannot be analyzed on a stand-alone basis. However, when considered within a portfolio context, some benefit from managed futures products can be achieved.

However, in only one case, managed energy futures products, did CTAs provide a Sharpe ratio greater than the passive strategy offered by the MLMI. Even CTA managed agriculture futures did not provide a higher Sharpe ratio than the MLMI. In fact, if we compare the second panel in Exhibit 32.12 to the first panel, it appears that almost all of the passive commodity futures indices outperformed the active CTA strategies in terms of both downside risk protection and Sharpe ratios.

The downside risk protection demonstrated by managed futures products is consistent with the research of Schneeweis, Spurgin, and Potter and Anson.[18] Specifically, they find that a combination of  $50\%$  S&P 500 stocks and  $50\%$  CTA managed futures outperforms a portfolio comprised of the S&P 500 plus protective put options. Unfortunately, our research indicates that only in limited circumstances do managed futures products offer financial benefits greater than that offered by a passive futures index.

# CONCLUSION

In this chapter we examined the benefits of managed futures products. Prior empirical research has not resolved the issue of whether managed futures products can add value either as a stand-alone investment or as part of a diversified portfolio.

On a stand-alone basis, our review indicates that managed futures products fail to outperform a naive trend following index represented by the MLMI. The MLMI is a transparent commodity futures index that mechanically applies a simple price trend following rule for buying or selling commodity futures. We did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that skill-based CTA trading can outperform this passive index of commodity futures.

On a portfolio basis, the results were more encouraging. We found that managed futures products did provide downside risk protection that, on average, ranged from  $0.11\%$  to  $0.26\%$  per downside month. Unfortunately, only in limited circumstances (energy futures products) did CTA managed products outperform passive commodity futures indices either on a Sharpe ratio basis or with respect to downside risk protection.
