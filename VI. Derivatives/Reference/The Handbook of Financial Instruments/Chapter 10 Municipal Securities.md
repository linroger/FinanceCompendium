Debt obligations are issued by state and local governments and by entities that they establish. Local government units include municipalities, counties, towns and townships, school districts, and special service system districts. Included in the category of municipalities are cities, villages, boroughs, and incorporated towns that received a special state charter. Counties are geographical subdivisions of states whose functions are law enforcement, judicial administration, and construction and maintenance of roads. As with counties, towns and townships are geographical subdivisions of states and perform similar functions as counties. A special-purpose service system district, or simply special district, is a political subdivision created to foster economic development or related services to a geographical area. Special districts provide public utility services (water, sewers, and drainage) and fire protection services. Public agencies or instrumentalities include authorities and commissions.

The number of municipal bond issuers is remarkable. One broker/ dealer's estimate places the total at 60,055. Also, Bloomberg Financial Markets' (Bloomberg) database contains 55,000 active issuers. Even more noteworthy is the number of different issues. Interactive Data, a company that provides pricing information for institutional investors, claims that it provides daily prices for more than 1.2 million individual issues in its database. Bloomberg's database contains 1.7 million issues with complete description pages.

In this chapter, we discuss the types of debt obligations issued by states, municipal governments, and public agencies and their instrumentalities. These securities are popularly referred to as municipal securities, although they are also issued by states and public agencies and their instruments.

# TAX-EXEMPT AND TAXABLE MUNICIPAL SECURITIES

There are both tax-exempt and taxable municipal securities. "Tax-exempt" means that interest on a municipal security is exempt from federal income taxation. The tax-exemption of municipal securities applies to interest income, not capital gains. The exemption may or may not extend to taxation at the state and local levels.

The state tax treatment depends on (1) whether the issue from which the interest income is received is an "in-state issue" or an "out-of-state issue," and (2) whether the investor is an individual or a corporation. The treatment of interest income at the state level will be one of the following:

■ taxation of interest from municipal issues regardless of whether the issuer is in-state or out-of-state exemption of interest from all municipal issues regardless of whether the issuer is in-state or out-of-state
exemption of interest from municipal issues that are in-state but some form of taxation where the source of interest is an out-of-state issuer.

For individuals, for those states that have a state income tax, only the following states tax interest income from in-state issuers (although there may be some exceptions for certain out-of-state issues): Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin. Exhibit 10.1 identifies those states for which out-of-state issues are exempt from taxation. This exhibit also shows the maximum state tax rate on principals and the effective state tax rate on principals. (We'll see what the last three column in Exhibit 10.1 mean later in this chapter.)

Most municipal securities that have been issued are tax-exempt. Municipal securities are commonly referred to as tax-exempt securities although taxable municipal securities have been issued and are traded in the market. Municipalities issue taxable municipal bonds to finance projects that do not qualify for financing with tax-exempt bonds. An example is a sports stadium. The most common types of taxable municipal bonds are industrial revenue bonds and economic development bonds. Since there are federally mandated restrictions on the amount of tax-exempt bonds that can be issued, a municipality will issue taxable bonds when the maximum is reached. There are some issuers who have issued taxable bonds in order to take advantage of demand outside of the United States.

There are other types of tax-exempt bonds. These include bonds issued by nonprofit organizations. Such organizations are structured so that none of the income from the operations of the organization benefit an individual or private shareholder. The designation of a nonprofit organization must be obtained from the Internal Revenue Service. Since the tax-exempt designation is provided pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, the tax-exempt bonds issued by such organizations are referred to as 501(c)(3) obligations. Museums and foundations fall into this category. Tax-exempt obligations also include bonds issued by the District of Columbia and any possession of the United States—Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The interest income from securities issued by U.S. territories and possessions is exempt from federal, state, and local income taxes in all 50 states.

# TAX PROVISIONS AFFECTING MUNICIPALS

Federal tax rates and the treatment of municipal interest at the state and local levels affect municipal security values and strategies employed by investors. There are provisions in the Internal Revenue Code that investors in municipal securities should recognize. These provisions deal with original issue discounts, the alternative minimum tax, and the deductibility of interest expense incurred to acquire municipal securities.

# Treatment of Original-Issue Discount

If at the time of issuance the original-issue price is less than its maturity value, the bond is said to be an original-issue discount (OID) bond. The difference between the par value and the original-issue price represents tax-exempt interest that the investor realizes by holding the issue to maturity.

For municipal bonds there is a complex treatment that few investors recognize when purchasing OID municipal bonds. The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 specifies that any capital appreciation from the sale of a municipal bond that was purchased in the secondary market after April 30, 1993 could be either (1) free from any federal income taxes, (2) taxed at the capital gains rate, (3) taxed at the ordinary income rate, or (4) taxed at a combination of the two rates.

The key to the tax treatment is the rule of de minimis for any type of bond. The rule states that a bond is to be discounted up to  $0.25\%$  from the par value for each remaining year of a bond's life before it is affected by ordinary income taxes. The discounted price based on this rule is called the market discount cutoff price. The relationship between the market price at which an investor purchases a bond, the market discount cutoff price, and the tax treatment of the capital appreciation realized from a sale is as follows. If the bond is purchased at a market discount, but the price is higher than the market discount cutoff price, then any capital appreciation realized from a sale will be taxed at the capital gains rate. If the purchase price is lower than the market discount cutoff price, then any capital appreciation realized from a sale may be taxed as ordinary income or a combination of the ordinary income rate and the capital gains rate. (Several factors determine what the exact tax rate will be in this case.)


The market discount cutoff price changes over time because of the rule of de minimis. The price is revised. An investor must be aware of the revised price when purchasing a municipal bond because this price is used to determine the tax treatment.

# Alternative Minimum Tax

Alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) is a taxpayer's taxable income with certain adjustments for specified tax preferences designed to cause AMTI to approximate economic income. For both individuals and corporations, a taxpayer's liability is the greater of (1) the tax computed at regular tax rates on taxable income and (2) the tax computed at a lower rate on AMTI. This parallel tax system, the alternative minimum tax (AMT), is designed to prevent taxpayers from avoiding significant tax liability as a result of taking advantage of exclusions from gross income, deductions, and tax credits otherwise allowed under the Internal Revenue Code.

One of the tax preference items that must be included is certain tax-exempt municipal interest. As a result of AMT, the value of the tax-exempt feature is reduced. However, the interest of not all municipal issues is subject to the AMT. Under the current tax code, tax-exempt interest earned on all private activity bonds issued after August 7, 1986 must be included in AMTI. There are two exceptions. First, interest from bonds that are issued by 501(c)(3) organizations (i.e., not-for-profit organizations) is not subject to AMTI. The second exception is interest from bonds issued for the purpose of refunding if the original bonds were issued before August 7, 1986. The AMT does not apply to interest on governmental or nonprivate activity municipal bonds. An implication is that those issues that are subject to the AMT will trade at a higher yield than those exempt from AMT.

# Deductibility of Interest Expense Incurred to Acquire Municipals

Ordinarily, the interest expense on borrowed funds to purchase or carry investment securities is tax deductible. There is one exception that is rel- evant to investors in municipal bonds. The Internal Revenue Code specifies that interest paid or accrued on "indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations, the interest on which is wholly exempt from taxes," is not tax deductible. It does not make any difference if any tax-exempt interest is actually received by the taxpayer in the taxable year. In other words, interest is not deductible on funds borrowed to purchase or carry tax-exempt securities.


# TYPES OF MUNICIPAL SECURITIES

Municipal securities are issued for various purposes. Short-term notes typically are sold in anticipation of the receipt of funds from taxes or receipt of proceeds from the sale of a bond issue, for example. Proceeds from the sale of short-term notes permit the issuing municipality to cover seasonal and temporary imbalances between outlays for expenditures and inflows from taxes. Municipalities issue long-term bonds as the principal means for financing both (1) long-term capital projects such as schools, bridges, roads, and airports, and (2) long-term budget deficits that arise from current operations.

An official statement describing the issue and the issuer is prepared for new offerings. Municipal securities have legal opinions that are summarized in the official statement. The importance of the legal opinion is twofold. First, bond counsel determines if the issue is indeed legally able to issue the securities. Second, bond counsel verifies that the issuer has properly prepared for the bond sale by having enacted various required ordinances, resolutions, and trust indentures and without violating any other laws and regulations.

There are basically two types of municipal security structures: tax-backed debt and revenue bonds. We describe each type as follows, as well as variants.

# Tax-Backed Debt

Tax-backed debt obligations are instruments issued by states, counties, special districts, cities, towns, and school districts that are secured by some form of tax revenue. Tax-backed debt includes general obligation debt, appropriation-backed obligations, debt obligations supported by public credit enhancement programs, and short-term debt instruments. We discuss each type as follows.

# General Obligation Debt

The broadest type of tax-backed debt is general obligation debt. There are two types of general obligation pledges: unlimited and limited. An unlimited tax general obligation debt (also called an ad valorem property tax debt) is the stronger form of general obligation pledge because it is secured by the issuer's unlimited taxing power. The tax revenue sources include corporate and individual income taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes. Unlimited tax general obligation debt is said to be secured by the full faith and credit of the issuer. A limited tax general obligation debt (also called a limited ad valorem tax debt) is a limited tax pledge because for such debt there is a statutory limit on tax rates that the issuer may levy to service the debt.

Certain general obligation bonds are secured not only by the issuer's general taxing powers to create revenues accumulated in a general fund, but also by certain identified fees, grants, and special charges, which provide additional revenues from outside the general fund. Such bonds are known as double-barreled in security because of the dual nature of the revenue sources. For example, the debt obligations issued by special-purpose service systems may be secured by a pledge of property taxes, a pledge of special fees/operating revenue from the service provided, or a pledge of both property taxes and special fees/operating revenues. In the last case, they are double-barreled.

# Appropriation-Backed Obligations

Agencies or authorities of several states have issued bonds that carry a potential state liability for making up shortfalls in the issuing entity's obligation. The appropriation of funds from the state's general tax revenue must be approved by the state legislature. However, the state's pledge is not binding. Debt obligations with this nonbinding pledge of tax revenue are called moral obligation bonds. Because a moral obliga tion bond requires legislative approval to appropriate the funds, it is classified as an appropriation-backed obligation.


An example of the legal language describing the procedure for a moral obligation bond that is enacted into legislation is as follows:

In order to further assure the maintenance of each such debt reserve fund, there shall be annually apportioned and paid to the agency for deposit in each debt reserve fund such sum, if any, as shall be certified by the chairman of the agency to the governor and director of the budget as necessary to restore such reserve fund to an amount equal to the debt reserve fund requirement. The chairman of the agency shall annually, on or before December 1, make and deliver to the governor and director of the budget his certificate stating the sum or sums, if any, required to restore each such debt reserve fund to the amount aforesaid, and the sum so certified, if any, shall be apportioned and paid to the agency during the then current state fiscal year.

The purpose of the moral obligation pledge is to enhance the creditworthiness of the issuing entity. The first moral obligation bond was issued by the Housing Finance Agency of the state of New York. Historically, most moral obligation debt has been self-supporting; that is, it has not been necessary for the state of the issuing entity to make an appropriation. In those cases in which state legislatures have been called on to make an appropriation, they have. For example, the states of New York and Pennsylvania did this for bonds issued by their Housing Finance Agency; the state of New Jersey did this for bonds issued by the Southern Jersey Port Authority.

Another type of appropriation-backed obligation is lease-backed debt. There are two types of leases. One type is basically a secured long-term loan disguised as lease. The "leased" asset is the security for the loan. In the case of a bankruptcy, the court would probably rule such an obligation as the property of the user of the leased asset and the debt obligation of the user. In contrast, the second type of lease is a true lease in which the user of the leased asset (called the lessee) makes periodic payments to the leased asset's owner (called the lessor) for the right to use the leased asset. For true leases, there must be an annual appropriation by the municipality to continue making the lease payments.

# Dedicated Tax-Backed Obligations

In recent years, states and local governments have issued increasing amounts of bonds where the debt service is to be paid from so-called dedi- cated revenues such as sales taxes, tobacco settlement payments, fees, and penalty payments. Many are structured to mimic asset-backed securities.


# Debt Obligations Supported by Public Credit Enhancement Programs

While a moral obligation is a form of credit enhancement provided by a state, it is not a legally enforceable or legally binding obligation of the state. There are entities that have issued debt that carries some form of public credit enhancement that is legally enforceable. This occurs when there is a guarantee by the state or a federal agency or when there is an obligation to automatically withhold and deploy state aid to pay any defaulted debt service by the issuing entity. Typically, the latter form of public credit enhancement is used for debt obligations of a state's school systems.

Here are some examples of state credit enhancement programs. Virginia's bond guarantee program authorizes the governor to withhold state aid payments to a municipality and divert those funds to pay principal and interest to a municipality's general obligation holders in the event of a default. South Carolina's constitution requires mandatory withholding of state aid by the state treasurer if a school district is not capable of meeting its general obligation debt. Texas created the Permanent School Fund to guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest of the debt obligations of qualified school districts. The fund's income is obtained from land and mineral rights owned by the state of Texas.

# Short-Term Debt Instruments

Short-term debt instruments include municipal notes, commercial paper, variable-rate demand obligations, and a hybrid of the last two products.

Municipal Notes Usually, municipal notes are issued for a period of 12 months, although it is not uncommon for such notes to be issued for periods as short as 3 months and for as long as 3 years. Municipal notes include bond anticipation notes (BANs) and cash flow notes. BANs are issued in anticipation of the sale of long-term bonds. The issuing entity must obtain funds in the capital market to pay off the obligation.

Cash flow notes include tax anticipation notes (TANs) and revenue anticipation notes (RANs). TANs and RANs (also known as TRANs) are issued in anticipation of the collection of taxes or other expected revenues. These are borrowings to even out irregular flows into the treasury of the issuing entity. The pledge for cash flow notes can be either a broad general obligation pledge of the issuer or a pledge from a specific revenue source. The lien position of cash flow noteholders relative to other general obligation debt that has been pledged the same revenue can be either (1) a first lien on all pledged revenue, thereby having priority over general obligation debt that has been pledged the same revenue, (2) a lien that is in parity with general obligation debt that has been pledged the same revenue, or (3) a lien that is subordinate to the lien of general obligation debt that has been pledged the same revenue.


Commercial Paper In Chapter 6, we discuss commercial paper issued by corporations. Commercial paper is also used by municipalities to raise funds on a short-term basis ranging from 1 day to 270 days. There are two types of commercial paper issued, unenhanced and enhanced. Unenhanced commercial paper is a debt obligation issued based solely on the issuer's credit quality and liquidity capability. Enhanced commercial paper is a debt obligation that is credit enhanced with bank liquidity facilities (e.g., a letter of credit), insurance, or a bond purchase agreement. The role of the enhancement is to reduce the risk of nonrepayment of the maturing commercial paper by providing a source of liquidity for payment of that debt in the event no other funds of the issuer are currently available.

Provisions in the 1986 tax act restricted the issuance of tax-exempt commercial paper. Specifically, the act limited the new issuance of municipal obligations that are tax exempt, and as a result, every maturity of a tax-exempt municipal issuance is considered a new debt issuance. Consequently, very limited issuance of tax-exempt commercial paper exists. Instead, issuers use one of the next two products to raise short-term funds.

Variable-Rate Demand Obligations Variable-rate demand obligations (VRDOs) are floating-rate obligations that have a nominal long-term maturity but have a coupon rate that is reset either daily or every 7 days. The investor has an option to put the issue back to the trustee at any time with 7 days notice. The put price is par plus accrued interest. There are unenhanced and enhanced VRDOs.

Commercial Paper/VRDO Hybrid The commercial paper/VRDO hybrid is customized to meet the cash flow needs of an investor. As with tax-exempt commercial paper, there is flexibility in structuring the maturity because a remarketing agent establishes interest rates for a range of maturities. Although the instrument may have a long nominal maturity, there is a put provision as with a VRDO. Put periods can range from 1 day to more than 360 days. On the put date, the investor can put back the bonds, receiving principal and interest, or the investor can elect to extend the maturity at the new interest rate and put date posted by the remarketing agent at that time. Thus the investor has two choices when initially purchasing this instrument: the interest rate and the put date. Interest is generally paid on the put date if the date is within 180 days. If the put date is more than 180 days forward, interest is paid semiannually.


Commercial paper dealers market these products under a proprietary name. For example, the Merrill Lynch product is called Unit Priced Demand Adjustable Tax-Exempt Securities, or UPDATES. Lehman Brothers markets these simply as money market principals and Goldman Sachs refers to these securities as flexible rate notes.

# Revenue Bonds 2

The second basic type of security structure is found in a revenue bond. Revenue bonds are issued for enterprise financings that are secured by the revenues generated by the completed projects themselves, or for general public-purpose financings in which the issuers pledge to the bondholders the tax and revenue resources that were previously part of the general fund. This latter type of revenue bond is usually created to allow issuers to raise debt outside general obligation debt limits and without voter approval.

Revenue bonds can be classified by the type of financing. These include utility revenue bonds, transportation revenue bonds, housing revenue bonds, higher education revenue bonds, health care revenue bonds, seaport revenue bonds, sports complex and convention center revenue bonds, and industrial development revenue bonds. We discuss these revenue bonds as follows. Revenue bonds are also issued by Section 501(c)3 entities (museums and foundations).

# Utility Revenue Bonds

Utility revenue bonds include water, sewer, and electric revenue bonds. Water revenue bonds are issued to finance the construction of water treatment plants, pumping stations, collection facilities, and distribution systems. Revenues usually come from connection fees and charges paid by the users of the water systems. Electric utility revenue bonds are secured by revenues produced from electrical operating plants. Some bonds are for a single issuer who constructs and operates power plants and then sells the electricity. Other electric utility revenue bonds are issued by groups of public and private investor-owned utilities for the joint financing of the construction of one or more power plants.

Also included as part of utility revenue bonds are resource recovery revenue bonds. A resource recovery facility converts refuse (solid waste) into commercially saleable energy, recoverable products, and residue to be landfilled. The major revenues securing these bonds usually are (1) fees paid by those who deliver the waste to the facility for disposal, (2) revenues from steam, electricity, or refuse-derived fuel sold to either an electric power company or another energy user, and (3) revenues from the sale of recoverable materials such as aluminum and steel scrap.

# Transportation Revenue Bonds

Included in the category of transportation revenue bonds are toll road revenue bonds, highway user tax revenue bonds, airport revenue bonds, and mass transit bonds secured by farebox revenues. For toll road revenue bonds, bond proceeds are used to build specific revenue-producing facilities such as toll roads, bridges, and tunnels. The pledged revenues are the monies collected through tolls. For highway-user tax revenue bonds, the bondholders are paid by earmarked revenues outside of toll collections, such as gasoline taxes, automobile registration payments, and driver's license fees. The revenues securing airport revenue bonds usually come from either traffic-generated sources—such as landing fees, concession fees, and airline fueling fees—or lease revenues from one or more airlines for the use of a specific facility such as a terminal or hangar.

# Housing Revenue Bonds

There are two types of housing revenue bonds: single-family mortgage revenue bonds and multifamily housing revenue bonds. The former revenue bonds are secured by the mortgages and loan repayments on 1-to-4-single-family homes. Security features vary but can include Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Veterans Administration (VA), or private mortgage insurance. Multifamily revenue bonds are usually issued for multifamily housing projects for senior citizens and low-income families. Some housing revenue bonds are secured by mortgages that are federally insured; others receive federal government operating subsidies or interest-cost subsidies. Still others receive only local property tax reductions as subsidies.

# Higher Education Revenue Bonds

There are two types of higher education revenue bonds: college and university revenue bonds and student loan revenue bonds. The revenues securing public and private college and university revenue bonds usually include dormitory room rental fees, tuition payments, and sometimes the general assets of the college or university. For student loan revenue bonds, student loan repayments are sometimes  $100\%$  guaranteed either directly by the federal government or by a state guaranty agency.


# Health Care Revenue Bonds

Health care revenue bonds are issued by private, not-for-profit hospitals (including rehabilitation centers, children's hospitals, and psychiatric institutions) and other health care providers such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs), continuing care retirement communities and nursing homes, cancer centers, university faculty practice plans, and medical specialty practices. The revenue for health care revenue bonds usually depends on federal and state reimbursement programs (such as Medicaid and Medicare), third-party commercial payers (such as Blue Cross, HMOs, and private insurance), and individual patient payments.

# Seaport Revenue Bonds

The security for seaport revenue bonds can include specific lease agreements with the benefiting companies or pledged marine terminal and cargo tonnage fees.

# Special Bond Structures

Some municipal securities have special security structures. These include insured bonds, bank-backed municipal bonds, and refunded bonds. We describe these three special security structures as follows.

# Insured Bonds

Insured bonds, in addition to being secured by the issuer's revenue, are also backed by insurance policies written by commercial insurance companies. Insurance on a municipal bond is an agreement by an insurance company to pay the bondholder any bond principal and/or coupon interest that is due on a stated maturity date but that has not been paid by the bond issuer. The payment by the bond insurer is not an advance payment of the principal to pay off the issue and interest. Rather, the payments are made according the original schedule of payments that the issuer would have had to make.

Once issued, municipal bond insurance usually extends for the term of the bond issue, and it cannot be canceled by the insurance company. Because bond insurance is an unconditional promise by the insurer to meet the principal and interest payment obligations of the issuer, should the issuer be unable to do so for the life of the bond issue, it is different from credit enhancement in the form of a letter of credit, described later.

Because municipal bond insurance reduces credit risk for the investor, the marketability of certain municipal bonds can be greatly expanded. Municipal bonds that benefit most from the insurance would include lower-quality bonds, bonds issued by smaller governmental units not widely known in the financial community, bonds that have a sound though complex and confusing security structure, and bonds issued by infrequent local-government borrowers that do not have a general market following among investors.


There are two major groups of municipal bond insurers. The first includes the "monoline" companies that are primarily in the business of insuring municipal bonds. Almost all of the companies that are now insuring municipal bonds can be characterized as monoline in structure. The second group of municipal bond insurers includes the "multiline" property and casualty companies that usually have a wide base of business, including insurance for fires, collisions, hurricanes, and health problems. Most new issues in the municipal bond market today are insured by the following monoline insurers: AMBAC Indemnity Corporation (AMBAC); Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC); Financial Security Assurance, Inc. (FSA); and Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation (MBIA Corp.). State insurance commissions regulate bond insurance companies. In addition, bond insurance companies are rated by credit rating agencies.

The credit quality considerations of bond insurers in evaluating whether or not to insure an issue are more stringent than that used by a rating agency in assigning a rating to an issue. This is because the bond insurer is making a commitment for the life of the issue. In contrast, a rating agency assigns a rating that would be expected to change in the future if there is credit deterioration of the issuer. That is, a rating agency can change a rating but an insurer cannot change its obligation. Consequently, bond insurers typically insure bonds that would have received an investment grade rating (at least triple B) in the absence of any insurance. Depending on competitive conditions and insurer costs, the premium charged for bond insurance typically ranges from  $0.1\%$  to  $2\%$  of the combined principal and interest payable over the issue's life.

# Bank-Backed Municipal Bonds

Since the 1980s, municipal obligations have been increasingly supported by various types of credit facilities provided by commercial banks. The support is in addition to the issuer's cash flow revenues. There are three basic types of bank support: letter of credit, irrevocable line of credit, and revolving line of credit.

A letter of credit is the strongest type of support available from a commercial bank. Under this arrangement, the bank is required to advance funds to the trustee if a default has occurred. An irrevocable line of credit is not a guarantee of the bond issue, though it does provide a level of security. A revolving line of credit is a liquidity-type credit facility that provides a source of liquidity for payment of maturing debt in the event no other funds of the issuer are currently available. Because a bank can cancel a revolving line of credit without notice if the issuer fails to meet certain covenants, bond security depends entirely on the creditworthiness of the municipal issuer.


# Refunded Bonds

Although originally issued as either revenue or general obligation bonds, municipal bonds are sometimes refunded. A refunding usually occurs when the original bonds are escrowed or collateralized by direct obligations guaranteed by the U.S. government. By this it is meant that a portfolio of securities guaranteed by the U.S. government are placed in a trust. The portfolio of securities is assembled such that the cash flows from the securities match the obligations that the issuer must pay. For example, suppose that a municipality has a  $7\%$  $100 million issue with 12 years remaining to maturity. The municipality's obligation is to make payments of $3.5 million every 6 months for the next 12 years and $100 million 12 years from now. If the issuer wants to refund this issue, a portfolio of U.S. government obligations can be purchased that has a cash flow of $3.5 million every 6 months for the next 12 years and 100 million 12 years from now.

Once this portfolio of securities whose cash flows match those of the municipality's obligation is in place, the refunded bonds are no longer general obligation or revenue bonds. The bonds are now supported by the cash flows from the portfolio of securities held in an escrow fund. Such bonds, if escrowed with securities guaranteed by the U.S. government, have little, if any, credit risk. They are the safest municipal bonds available.

The escrow fund for a refunded municipal bond can be structured so that the refunded bonds are to be called at the first possible call date or a subsequent call date established in the original bond indenture. Such bonds are known as prerefunded municipal bonds. While refunded bonds are usually retired at their first or subsequent call date, some are structured to match the debt obligation to the retirement date. Such bonds are known as escrowed-to-maturity bonds.

# Municipal Derivative Securities

In recent years, a number of municipal products have been created from the basic fixed-rate municipal bonds. This has been done by splitting up cash flows of newly issued bonds as well as bonds existing in the secondary markets. These products have been created by dividing the cou pon interest payments and principal payments into two or more bond classes, or tranches. The resulting bond classes may have far different yield and price volatility characteristics than the underlying fixed-rate municipal bond from which they were created.


The name derivative securities has been attributed to these bond classes because they derive their value from the underlying fixed-rate municipal bond. Two examples are municipal strip obligations and inverse floaters.

Municipal strip obligations are created when a municipal bond's cash flows are used to back zero-coupon instruments. The maturity value of each zero-coupon bond represents a cash flow of the underlying security. These are similar to the strips that are created in the Treasury market that are described in Chapter 7.

The primary vehicle to create inverse floaters is the Tender Offer Bond (TOB) programs. TOBs feature a liquidity facility, which makes these floating-rate derivatives putable and therefore eligible for money market funds. These liquidity facilities typically last 364 days and are provided by highly rated banks or broker-dealers. Several proprietary programs have been developed to market and sell plain-vanilla TOBs, which are used by mutual bond funds and insurance companies. Additionally, TOBs are used in more exotic combination trades by a few Wall Street structured products areas. Salomon Smith Barney's proprietary program is called "ROCs & ROLs." The short-term certificates are called ROCs or Residual Option Certificates. The inverse floaters are called the "ROLs" or Residual Option Longs. Lehman's is called RIBS and Trust Receipts, and Morgan Stanley's proprietary program is called municipal trust certificates.

# DEBT RETIREMENT STRUCTURE

Municipal securities are issued with one of two debt retirement structures or a combination of both. Either a bond has a serial maturity structure or a term maturity structure. A serial maturity structure requires a portion of the debt obligation to be retired each year. A term maturity structure provides for the debt obligation to be repaid on a final date.

The various provisions explained in Chapter 1 for paying off an issue prior to maturity—call provisions and sinking fund provisions—are also found in municipal securities. In revenue bonds there is a *catastrophe* call provision that requires the issuer to call the entire issue if the facility is destroyed.

For housing revenue bonds, the repayment of principal is made with each payment by the borrower. More specifically, there is a schedule of principal repayments. We will explain this when we cover mortgage-backed securities in later chapters. Moreover, as will be explained, a borrower has the right to pay off a mortgage prior to the maturity date. Any principal repayment in excess of the scheduled principal repayment is called a prepayment.

# CREDIT RISK

Investors rely on the credit ratings that are assigned by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, or simply rating companies. While there are three commercial rating companies, the two dominant companies with respect to rating municipal debt obligations are Standard & Poor's and Moody's. We discuss these ratings when we cover corporate debt obligations in Chapter 11. The factors that should be considered in assessing the credit risk of an issue are summarized next.

In assessing the credit risk of tax-backed debt, four basic categories are considered. The first category includes information on the issuer's debt structure to determine the overall debt burden. The second category relates to the issuer's ability and political discipline to maintain sound budgetary policy. The third category involves determining the specific local taxes and intergovernmental revenues available to the issuer, as well as obtaining historical information both on tax collection rates, which are important when looking at property tax levies, and on the dependence of local budgets on specific revenue sources. The final category of information is an assessment of the issuer's overall socioeconomic environment. The major factors here include trends of local employment distribution and composition, population growth, real estate property valuation, and personal income.

Revenue bonds are issued for either project or enterprise financings where the bond issuers pledge to the bondholders the revenues generated by the operating projects financed, or for general public-purpose financings in which the issuers pledge to the bondholders the tax and revenue resources that were previously part of the general fund. While there are numerous security structures for revenue bonds, the underlying principle in assessing the credit risk is whether the project being financed will generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy the obligations due bondholders.

The trust indenture and legal opinion should explain what are the revenues for the bonds and how they realistically may be limited by federal, state, and local laws and procedures. The importance of this is that although most revenue bonds are structured and appear to be supported by identifiable revenue streams, those revenues sometimes can be negatively affected directly by other levels of government.


# Flow-of-Funds Structure for Revenue Bonds

For a revenue bond, the revenue of the enterprise is pledged to service the debt of the issue. The details of how revenue received by the enterprise will be disbursed are set forth in the trust indenture. Typically, the flow of funds for a revenue bond is as follows. First, all revenues from the enterprise are put into a revenue fund. From the revenue fund, disbursements for expenses are made to the following funds: operation and maintenance fund, sinking fund, debt service reserve fund, renewal and replacement fund, reserve maintenance fund, and surplus fund.

# TAX RISK

The investor in municipal securities is exposed to tax risk. There are two types of tax risk to which tax-exempt municipal security investors are exposed. The first is the risk that the federal income tax rate will be reduced. The higher the marginal tax rate, the greater the value of the tax-exemption feature. As the marginal tax rate declines, the price of a tax-exempt municipal security will decline.

The second type of tax risk is that a municipal bond issued as a tax-exempt issue may be eventually declared by the Internal Revenue Service to be taxable. This may occur because many municipal revenue bonds have elaborate security structures that could be subject to future adverse congressional action and IRS interpretation. A loss of the tax-exemption feature will cause the municipal bond to decline in value in order to provide a yield comparable to similar taxable bonds.

# SECONDARY MARKET

Municipal bonds are traded in the over-the-counter market supported by municipal bond dealers across the country. Markets are maintained on smaller issuers (referred to as "local credits") by regional brokerage firms, local banks, and by some of the larger Wall Street firms. Larger issuers (referred to as "general market names") are supported by the larger brokerage firms and banks, many of whom have investment banking relationships with these issuers. There are brokers who serve as intermediaries in the sale of large blocks of municipal bonds among dealers and large institutional investors. Some municipal bonds are traded via the Internet.


In the municipal bond markets, an odd lot of bonds is  $25,000 or less in par value for retail investors. For institutions, anything less than$ 100,000 in par value is considered an odd lot. Dealer spreads depend on several factors. For the retail investor, the spread can range from as low as one-quarter of one point ( $12.50 per$ 5,000 par value) on large blocks of actively traded bonds to four points ( $200 per$ 5,000 of par value) for odd lot sales of an inactive issue. For institutional investors, the dealer spread rarely exceeds one-half of one point ( $25 per$ 5,000 of par value).

The convention for both corporate and Treasury bonds is to quote prices as a percentage of par value with 100 equal to par. Municipal bonds, however, generally are traded and quoted in terms of yield (yield to maturity or yield to call). The price of the bond in this case is called a basis price. The exception is certain long-maturity revenue bonds. A bond traded and quoted in dollar prices (actually, as a percentage of par value) is called a dollar bond.

Actual price and trade information for specific municipal bonds is available on a daily basis at no charge via the Internet at www.investing inbonds.com. This is the homepage of the Bond Market Association. The trade information provided is from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and Standard & Poor's J.J. Kenny. The original source of the trades reported are dealer-to-dealer transactions and dealer-to-institutional customer and retail (individual investor) transactions.

# YIELDS ON MUNICIPAL BONDS

Because of the tax-exempt feature of municipal bonds, the yield on municipal bonds is less than that on Treasuries with the same maturity. Exhibit 10.2 demonstrates this point.

Shown in the exhibit is the yield on AAA general obligation municipal bonds and the yield on same-maturity U.S. Treasuries. The yield ratio is the ratio of the municipal yield to the yield of a same-maturity Treasury security. Notice that the yield ratio increases with maturity. The ratio has changed over time. The higher the tax rate, the more attractive the tax-exempt feature and the lower the yield ratio.

EXHIBIT 10.2 Yield Ratio AAA General Obligation Municipal Bonds to U.S. Treasuries of the Same Maturity (February 12, 2002)

A common yield measure used to compare the yield on a tax-exempt municipal bond with a comparable taxable bond is the equivalent taxable yield. The equivalent taxable yield is computed as follows:

$$
\text {E q u i v a l e n t} = \frac {\text {T a x - e x e m p t y i e l d}}{1 - \text {M a r g i n a l t a x r a t e}}
$$

For example, suppose an investor in the  $40\%$  marginal tax bracket is considering the acquisition of a tax-exempt municipal bond that offers a yield of  $3.0\%$ . The equivalent taxable yield is  $5\%$ , as shown below:

$$
\text{Equivalent taxable yield} = \frac {0.03}{(1 - 0.40)} = 0.05 = 5 \%
$$

When computing the equivalent taxable yield, the traditionally computed yield to maturity is not the tax-exempt yield if the issue is selling at a discount because only the coupon interest is exempt from federal income taxes. Instead, the yield to maturity after an assumed tax rate on the capital gain is computed and used in the numerator of the formula above. The yield to maturity after an assumed tax on the capital gain is calculated.

# Yield Spread Relationships within the Municipal Market

Yield spreads within the municipal bond market are attributable to various factors. Unlike the taxable fixed income market, there is no risk-free interest rate benchmark. Instead, the benchmark interest rate is for a generic triple-A rated general obligation bond or a revenue bond. Thus, the benchmark triple-A rated issue or index is the base rate used in the municipal bond market.

# Tax Treatment at the State and Local Levels

State and local governments may tax interest income on municipal issues that are exempt from federal income taxes. Earlier in this chapter we discussed that a state can either tax or exempt the interest depending on whether the source of the interest is from an in-state or out-of-state issuer. The implication is that two municipal securities with the same credit rating and the same maturity may trade at some spread because of the relative demand for bonds of municipalities in different states. For example, in high-income-tax states such as New York and California, the demand for bonds of municipalities will drive down their yield relative to municipalities in a low-income-tax state such as Florida.

Since there is an advantage of buying in-state issues rather than out-of-state issues for individual investors in states that tax interest income on out-of-state issues, the question is: What is the yield given up? The last three columns in Exhibit 10.1, labeled "Basis Point Reduction," can be used by an individual investor to answer that question. It shows for in-state yield levels of  $3\%$ ,  $5\%$ , and  $6\%$ , approximately how much must be deducted from the out-of-state issue to obtain the same in-state yield. Take for example, an investor in Oregon who is considering an in-state issue offering a  $3\%$  yield. From the exhibit, the basis point reduction can be seen to be 16. This means that if a municipal issuer outside of Oregon is offering a yield of  $3.17\%$  (assuming the same credit rating), then this would be the same as investing in a municipal issue in Oregon offering a yield of  $3\%$ .

Corporations issue various types of financial instruments to raise funds. In general, corporate financial instruments can be classified as either a debt obligation or equity. In turn, equity can be classified as either common stock or preferred stock. In Chapter 4, common stock is covered. In Chapter 12, preferred stock is explained. Basically, the common stockholders are the residual owners of the firm. Preferred stockholders have priority over common stockholders in the case of distribution of dividends and proceeds in the case of liquidation of the firm.

The debt obligations of a corporation include bonds, medium-term notes, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, and bank loans. The key feature of corporate debt obligations is that they have a priority over the claims of equity holders in the case of bankruptcy. In this chapter we will focus on corporate bonds and medium-term notes. Other than the way in which they are issued, there is no difference between corporate bonds and medium-terms notes. Asset-backed securities, commercial paper, and banks loans are covered in Chapters 17, 6, and 19, respectively.

# CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY AND CREDITOR RIGHTS

The holder of a corporate debt instrument has priority over the equity owners in a bankruptcy proceeding. Moreover, there are creditors who have priority over other creditors. The law governing bankruptcy in the United States is the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978.


One purpose of the act is to set forth the rules for a corporation to be either liquidated or reorganized. The liquidation of a corporation means that all the assets will be distributed to the holders of claims of the corporation and no corporate entity will survive. In a reorganization, a new corporate entity will result. Some security holders of the bankrupt corporation will receive cash in exchange for their claims, others may receive new securities in the corporation that results from the reorganization, and others may receive a combination of both cash and new securities in the resulting corporation.

Another purpose of the bankruptcy act is to give a corporation time to decide whether to reorganize or liquidate and then the necessary time to formulate a plan to accomplish either a reorganization or liquidation. This is achieved because when a corporation files for bankruptcy, the act grants the corporation protection from creditors who seek to collect their claims. The petition for bankruptcy can be filed either by the company itself, in which case it is called a voluntary bankruptcy, or by its creditors, in which case it is called an involuntary bankruptcy. A company that files for protection under the bankruptcy act generally becomes a "debtor-in-possession," and continues to operate its business under the supervision of the court.

The bankruptcy act comprises 15 chapters, each chapter covering a particular type of bankruptcy. Chapter 7 deals with the liquidation of a company; Chapter 11 deals with the reorganization of a company. When a company is liquidated, creditors receive distributions based on the "absolute priority rule" to the extent assets are available. The absolute priority rule is the principle that senior creditors are paid in full before junior creditors are paid anything. For secured and unsecured creditors, the absolute priority rule guarantees their seniority to equity-holders.

# The Rights of Creditors: Theory versus Practice

What actually occurs in a bankruptcy? That is, does the absolute priority rule hold in a liquidation and a reorganization? In liquidations, the absolute priority rule generally holds. In contrast, studies of actual reorganizations under Chapter 11 have found that the violation of absolute priority is the rule rather than the exception.

There are several possible explanations suggested as to why in a reorganization the distribution made to claimholders will diverge from that required by the absolute priority principle. The first explanation is that the longer the negotiation process among the parties, the greater the bankruptcy costs and the smaller the amount to be distributed to all parties. This is because the longer the negotiation process among the parties, the more likely that the company will be operated in a manner that is not in the best interest of the creditors and, as a result, the smaller the amount remaining for distribution. Since all impaired classes including equityholders generally must approve the plan of reorganization, creditors often convince equityholders to accept the plan by offering to distribute some value to them.


A second explanation is that the violation of absolute priority reflects a contracting process between stockholders and senior creditors that gives recognition to the ability of management to preserve value on behalf of stockholders. According to this view, creditors are less informed than management about the true economic operating conditions of the firm. Because the distribution to creditors in the plan of reorganization is based on the valuation by the firm, creditors without perfect information easily suffer the loss. Managers generally have a better understanding than creditors or stockholders about a firm's internal operations, while creditors and stockholders can have better information about industry trends. Management may therefore use its superior knowledge to present the data in a manner that reinforces its position.

The essence of another explanation is that the increasing complexity of firms that declare bankruptcy will accentuate the negotiating process and result in an even higher incidence of violation of the absolute priority rule. The likely outcome is further supported by the increased number of official committees in the reorganization process, as well as the increased number of financial and legal advisors.

There are some who argue that creditors will receive a higher value in reorganization than they would in liquidation in part because of the costs associated with liquidation. These additional costs include commissions and Chapter 7-specific costs. The commissions associated with liquidation can be significant. The commission charged on the sale of a particular asset could be as high as  $20\%$  of the gross proceeds from the asset. Total liquidation costs can be significant.

Finally, the lack of symmetry in the tax system (negative taxes are not permitted, although loss deductions may be carried forward) results in situations in which the only way to use all current loss deductions is to merge. The tax system may encourage continuance or merger and discourage bankruptcy.

# SECURED DEBT

A corporate debt issue can be secured or unsecured. Here we look at secured debt. By secured debt it is meant that some form of collateral is pledged to ensure repayment of the debt.

# Utility Mortgage Bonds

Debt secured by real property such as plant and equipment is called mortgage debt. The largest issuers of mortgage debt are the electric utility companies. Other utilities, such as telephone companies and gas pipeline and distribution firms, have also used mortgage debt as sources of capital, but generally to a lesser extent than electrics.

Most electric utility bond indentures do not limit the total amount of bonds that may be issued. This is called an open-ended mortgage. The mortgage generally is a first lien on the company's real estate, fixed property, and franchises, subject to certain exceptions or permitted encumbrances owned at the time of the execution of the indenture or its supplement. The after-acquired property clause also subjects to the mortgage property that is acquired by the company after the filing of the original or supplemental indenture.

To provide for proper maintenance of the property and replacement of worn-out plant, maintenance fund, maintenance and replacement fund, or renewal and replacement fund, provisions are placed in indentures. These clauses stipulate that the issuer spend a certain amount of money for these purposes. Depending on the company, the required sums may be around  $15\%$  of operating revenues. As defined in other cases, the figure is based on a percentage of the depreciable property or amount of bonds outstanding.

Another provision for bondholder security is the release and substitution of property clause. If the company releases property from the mortgage lien (such as through a sale of a plant or other property that may have become obsolete or no longer necessary for use in the business, or through the state's power of eminent domain), it must substitute other property or cash and securities to be held by the trustee, usually in an amount equal to the released property's fair value. It may use the proceeds or cash held by the trustee to retire outstanding bonded debt. Certainly, a bondholder would not let go of the mortgaged property without substitution of satisfactory new collateral or adjustment in the amount of the debt because the bondholder should want to maintain the value of the security behind the bond. In some cases the company may waive the right to issue additional bonds.


Although the typical electric utility mortgage does not limit the total amount of bonds that may be issued, certain issuance tests or bases usually have to be satisfied before the company can sell more bonds. New bonds are often restricted to no more than  $60\%$  to  $66 \frac{1}{3}\%$  of the value of net bondable property. A further earnings test found often in utility indentures requires interest charges to be covered by pretax income available for interest charges of at least two times.

Mortgage bonds go by many different names. The most common of the senior lien issues are first mortgage bonds, first refunding mortgage bonds, first and refunding mortgage bonds, and first and general mortgage bonds.

There are instances when a company might have two or more layers of mortgage debt outstanding with different priorities. This situation usually occurs because companies cannot issue additional first mortgage debt (or the equivalent) under the existing indentures. Often this secondary debt level is called general and refunding mortgage bonds (G&R). In reality, this is mostly second mortgage debt.

# Other Mortgage Debt

Nonutility companies do not offer much mortgage debt nowadays; the preferred form of debt financing is unsecured. In the past, railroad operating companies were frequent issuers of mortgage debt. In many cases, a wide variety of secured debt might be found in a company's capitalization. One issue may have a first lien on a certain portion of the right of way and a second mortgage on another portion of the trackage, as well as a lien on the railroad's equipment, subject to the prior lien of existing equipment obligations. Certain railroad properties are not subject to such a lien. Railroad mortgages are often much more complex and confusing to bond investors than other types of mortgage debt.

In the broad classification of industrial companies, only a few have first mortgage bonds outstanding. Mortgages may also contain maintenance and repair provisions, earnings tests for the issuance of additional debt, release and substitution of property clauses, and limited after-acquired property provisions. In some cases, shares of subsidiaries might also be pledged as part of the lien. Some mortgage bonds are secured by a lien on a specific property rather than on most of a company's property, as in the case of an electric utility.

# Other Secured Debt

Debt can be secured by many different assets. Collateral trust debentures, bonds, and notes are secured by financial assets such as cash, receivables, other notes, debentures, or bonds, and not by real property. Collateral trust notes and debentures have been issued by companies engaged in vehicle leasing. The eligible collateral is held by a trustee and periodically marked to market to ensure that the market value has a liquidation value in excess of the amount needed to repay the entire outstanding bonds and accrued interest. If the collateral is insufficient, the issuer must bring the value of the collateral up to the required amount by a designated date. If the issuer is unable to do so, the trustee would then sell collateral and redeem bonds.


Another collateralized structure allows for the defeasance or "mandatory collateral substitution," which provides the investor assurance that it will continue to receive the same interest payments until maturity. Instead of redeeming the bonds with the proceeds of the collateral sale, the proceeds are used to purchase a portfolio of U.S. government securities in such an amount that the cash flow is sufficient to meet the principal and interest payments on the bond. Because of the structure of these issues, the rating agencies (discussed below) have assigned such issues their highest credit rating. The rating is based on the strength of the collateral and the issue's structure, not on the issuer's credit standing.

# Equipment Trust Financing: Railroads

Railroads and airlines have financed much of their rolling stock and aircraft with secured debt. The securities go by various names such as equipment trust certificates (ETCs), in the case of railroads, and secured equipment certificates, guaranteed loan certificates, and loan certificates in the case of airlines. Railroads probably comprise the largest and oldest group of issuers of secured equipment financing.

The credit ratings for equipment trust certificates are higher than on the same company's mortgage debt or other public debt securities. This is due primarily to the collateral value of the equipment, its superior standing in bankruptcy compared with other claims, and the instrument's generally self-liquidating nature. The railroad's actual creditworthiness may mean less for some equipment trust investors than for investors in other railroad securities or, for that matter, other corporate debt obligations.

Equipment trust certificates are issued under agreements that provide a trust for the benefit of the investors. Each certificate represents an interest in the trust equal to its principal amount and bears the railroad's unconditional guarantee of prompt payment, when due, of the principal and dividends (the term dividends is used because the payments represent income from a trust and not interest on a loan). The trustee holds the title to the equipment, which when the certificates are retired, passes to, or vests in, the railroad, but the railroad has all other ownership rights. It can take the depreciation and can utilize any tax benefits on the subject equipment. The railroad agrees to pay the trustee sufficient rental for the principal payments and the dividends due on the certificates, together with expenses of the trust and certain other charges. The railroad uses the equipment in its normal operations and is required to maintain it in good operating order and repair (at its own expense). If the equipment is destroyed, lost, or becomes worn out or unsuitable for use (i.e., suffers a "casualty occurrence"), the company must substitute the fair market value of that equipment in the form of either cash or additional equipment. Cash may be used to acquire additional equipment unless the agreement states otherwise. The trust equipment is usually clearly marked that it is not the railroad's property.


Immediately after the issuance of an ETC, the railroad has an equity interest in the equipment that provides a margin of safety for the investor. Normally, the ETC investor finances no more than  $80\%$  of the cost of the equipment and the railroad the remaining  $20\%$ . Although modern equipment is longer-lived than that of many years ago, the ETC's length of maturity is still generally the standard 15 years (there are some exceptions).

The structure of the financing usually provides for periodic retirement of the outstanding certificates. The most common form of ETC is the serial variety. It is usually issued in 15 equal maturities, each one coming due annually in years 1 through 15. There are also sinking fund equipment trust certificates where the ETCs are retired through the operation of a normal sinking fund, one-fifteenth of the original amount issued per year.

The standing of railroad or common carrier ETCs in bankruptcy is of vital importance to the investor. Because the equipment is needed for operations, the bankrupt railroad's management will more than likely reaffirm the lease of the equipment because, without rolling stock, it is out of business. Cases of disaffirmation of equipment obligations are very rare indeed, but if equipment debt were to be disaffirmed, the trustee could repossess and then try to release or sell it to others. Any deficiency due the equipment debtholders would still be an unsecured claim against the bankrupt railway company. Standard-gauge, nonspecialized equipment should not be difficult to release to another railroad.

The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 provides specifically that railroads be reorganized, not liquidated, and subchapter IV of Chapter 11 grants them special treatment and protection. One very important feature found in Section 77(j) of the preceding Bankruptcy Act was carried over to the new law. Section 1168 states that Section 362 (the automatic stay provision) and Section 363 (the use, sale, or lease of property section) are not applicable in railroad bankruptcies. It protects the rights of the equipment lenders while giving the trustee the chance to cure any defaults. Railroad bankruptcies usually do not occur overnight but creep up gradually as the result of steady deterioration over the years. New equipment financing capability becomes restrained. The outstanding equipment debt at the time of bankruptcy often is not substantial and usually has a good equity cushion built in. Equipment debt of noncommon carriers such as private car leasing lines does not enjoy this special protection under the Bankruptcy Act.


# Airline Equipment Debt

Airline equipment debt has some of the special status that is held by railroad equipment trust certificates. Like railroad equipment obligations, certain equipment debt of certified airlines, under Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, is not subject to Sections 362 and 363 of the Act, namely the automatic stay and the power of the court to prohibit the repossession of the equipment. The creditor must be a lessor, a conditional vendor, or hold a purchase money security interest with respect to the aircraft and related equipment. The secured equipment must be new, not used. It gives the airline 60 days in which to decide to cancel the lease or debt and to return the equipment to the trustee. If the reorganization trustee decides to reaffirm the lease in order to continue using the equipment, it must perform or assume the debtor's obligations, which become due or payable after that date, and cure all existing defaults other than those resulting solely from the financial condition, bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of the airline. Payments resume, including those that were due during the delayed period. Thus, the creditor will get either the payments due according to the terms of the contract or the equipment.

The equipment is an important factor. If the airplanes are of recent vintage, well-maintained, fuel efficient, and relatively economical to operate, it is more likely that a company in distress and seeking to reorganize would assume the equipment lease. However, if the outlook for reorganization appears dim from the outset and the airplanes are older and less economical, the airline could very well disaffirm the lease. In this case, releasing the aircraft or selling it at rents and prices sufficient to continue the original payments and terms to the security holders might be difficult. Of course, the resale market for aircraft is on a plane-by-plane basis and highly subject to supply and demand factors. Multimillion-dollar airplanes have a somewhat more limited market than do boxcars and hopper cars worth only a fraction of the value of an airplane.

The lease agreement required the airline to pay a rental sufficient to cover the interest, amortization of principal, and a return to the equity participant. The airline was responsible for maintaining and operating the aircraft, as well as providing for adequate insurance. It must also keep the equipment registered and record the ETC and lease under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. In the event of a loss or destruction of the equipment, the company may substitute similar equipment of equal value and in as good operating condition and repair and as airworthy as that which was lost or destroyed. It also has the option to redeem the outstanding certificates with the insurance proceeds.


Do not be misled by the title of the issue just because the words "secured" or "equipment trust" appear. Investors should look at the collateral and its estimated value based on the studies of recognized appraisers compared with the amount of equipment debt outstanding. Is the equipment new or used? Do the creditors benefit from Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act? Because the equipment is a depreciable item and subject to wear, tear, and obsolescence, a sinking fund starting within several years of the initial offering date should be provided if the debt is not issued in serial form. Of course, the ownership of the aircraft is important as just noted. Obviously, one must review the obligor's financials because the investor's first line of defense depends on the airline's ability to service the lease rental payments.

# UNSECURED DEBT

We have discussed many of the features common to secured debt. Take away the collateral and we have unsecured debt.

Unsecured debt, like secured debt, comes in several different layers or levels of claim against the corporation's assets. But in the case of unsecured debt, the nomenclature attached to the debt issues sounds less substantial. For example, "general and refunding mortgage bonds" may sound more important than "subordinated debentures," even though both are basically second claims on the corporate body. In addition to the normal debentures and notes, there are junior issues; for example, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, in addition to senior unsecured debt, had public issues designated as "senior subordinated" and "junior subordinated notes," representing the secondary and tertiary levels of the capital structure. The difference in a high-grade issuer may be considered insignificant as long as the issuer maintains its quality. But in cases of financial distress, the junior issues usually fare worse than the senior issues. Only in cases of very well-protected junior issues will investors come out whole—in which case, so would the holders of senior indebtedness. Thus, many investors are more than willing to take junior debt of high-grade compa nies; the minor additional risk, compared to that of the senior debt of lower-rated issuers, may well be worth the incremental income.


Subordination of the debt instrument might not be apparent from the issue's name. This is often the case with bank and bank-related securities. For example, the term "capital notes" would not sound like a subordinated debt instrument to most inexperienced investors unfamiliar with the jargon of the debt world. Yet capital notes are junior securities.

# Credit Enhancements

Some debt issuers have other companies guarantee their loans. This is normally done when a subsidiary issues debt and the investors want the added protection of a third-party guarantee. The use of guarantees makes it easier and more convenient to finance special projects and affiliates, although guarantees are extended to operating company debt.

There are also other types of third-party credit enhancements. Some captive finance subsidiaries of industrial companies enter into agreements requiring them to maintain fixed charge coverage at such a level so that the securities meet the eligibility standards for investment by insurance companies under New York State law. The required coverage levels are maintained by adjusting the prices at which the finance company buys its receivables from the parent company or through special payments from the parent company. These supplemental income maintenance agreements, while usually not part of indentures, are very important considerations for bond buyers.

Another credit-enhancing feature is the letter of credit (LOC) issued by a bank. A LOC requires the bank to make payments to the trustee when requested so that monies will be available for the bond issuer to meet its interest and principal payments when due. Thus the credit of the bank under the LOC is substituted for that of the debt issuer. Insurance companies also lend their credit standing to corporate debt, both new issues and outstanding secondary market issues, a common practice for municipal bonds.

While a guarantee or other type of credit enhancement may add some measure of protection to a debtholder, caution should not be thrown to the wind. In effect, an investor's job may become even more complex because an analysis of both the issuer and the guarantor should be performed. In many cases, only the latter is needed if the issuer is merely a financing conduit without any operations of its own. However, if both concerns are operating companies, it may very well be necessary to analyze both because the timely payment of principal and interest ultimately will depend on the stronger party. A downgrade of the enhancer's claims-paying ability reduces the value of the bonds.

# Negative Pledge Clause

One of the important protective provisions for unsecured debtholders is the negative pledge clause. This provision, found in most senior unsecured debt issues and a few subordinated issues, prohibits a company from creating or assuming any lien to secure a debt issue without equally securing the subject debt issue(s) (with certain exceptions). Designed to prevent other creditors from obtaining a senior position at the expense of existing creditors, "it is not intended to prevent other creditors from sharing in the position of debenture holders."2 Again, it is not necessary to have such a clause unless the issuer runs into trouble. But like insurance, it is not needed until the time that no one wants arrives.

Negative pledge clauses are not just boiler plate material added to indentures and loan agreements to give lawyers extra work. They have provided additional security for debtholders when the prognosis for corporate survival was bleak.

# INDENTURES

As we have seen, corporate debt securities come with an infinite variety of features, yet we have just scratched the surface. While prospectuses may provide most of the needed information, the indenture is the more important document. The indenture sets forth in great detail the promises of the issuer. Here we will look at what indentures of corporate debt issues contain. For corporate debt securities to be publicly sold, they must (with some permitted exceptions) be issued in conformity with the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. This act requires that debt issues subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have a trustee. Also, the trustee's duties and powers must be spelled out in the indenture.

Some corporate debt issues are issued under a blanket indenture or open-ended indenture; for others a new indenture must be written each time a new series of debt is sold. A blanket indenture is often used by electric utility companies and other issuers of general mortgage bonds, but it is also found in unsecured debt. The initial or basic indenture may have been entered into 30 or more years ago, but as each new series of debt is created, a supplemental indenture is written.

# Covenants

Certain limitations and restrictions on the borrower's activities are set forth in the indenture. Some covenants are common to all indentures, such as to pay interest, principal, and premium, if any, on a timely basis, to pay all taxes and other claims when due unless contested in good faith, and to maintain all properties used and useful in the borrower's business in good condition and working order. These are often called affirmative covenants since they call upon the debtor to make promises to do certain things.

Negative covenants require the borrower not to take certain actions. Borrowers want the least restrictive loan agreement available, while lenders should want the most restrictive, consistent with sound business practices. A company might be willing to include additional restrictions (up to a point) if it can get a lower interest rate on the loan. When companies seek to weaken restrictions in their favor, they are often willing to pay more interest or give other consideration.

An infinite variety of restrictive covenants can be placed on borrowers, depending on the type of debt issue, the economics of the industry and the nature of the business, and the lenders' desires. Some of the more common restrictive covenants include various limitations on the company's ability to incur debt, since unrestricted borrowing can lead a company and its debt-holders to ruin. Thus, debt restrictions may include limits on the absolute dollar amount of debt that may be outstanding or may require a ratio test (e.g., debt may be limited to no more than  $60\%$  of total capitalization or that it cannot exceed a certain percentage of net tangible assets).

There may be an interest coverage test or fixed-charge coverage test of which there are two types. One, a maintenance test, requires the borrower's ratio of earnings available for interest or fixed charges to be at least a certain minimum figure on each required reporting date (such as quarterly or annually) for a certain preceding period. The other type, a debt incurred test, only comes into play when the company wishes to do additional borrowing. In order to take on additional debt, the required interest or fixed-charge coverage figure adjusted for the new debt must be at a certain minimum level for the required period prior to the financing. Incurrence tests are generally considered less stringent than maintenance provisions. There could also be cash flow tests or requirements and working capital maintenance provisions.

# CORPORATE BOND RATINGS

Many large institutional investors and many investment banking firms have their own credit analysis departments. Few individual investors and institutional bond investors, though, do their own analysis. Instead, they rely primarily on nationally recognized statistical rating organizations that perform credit analyses and issue their conclusions in the form of ratings. The three commercial rating companies are Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's Corporation, and Fitch.


# Rating Symbols

The rating systems use similar symbols, as shown in Exhibit 11.1. In all systems the term high grade means low credit risk, or conversely, high probability of future payments. The highest-grade bonds are designated by Moody's by the symbol Aaa, and by the other two rating systems by the symbol AAA. The next highest grade is denoted by the symbol Aa (Moody's) or AA (the other two rating systems); for the third grade all rating systems use A. The next three grades are Baa or BBB, Ba or BB, and B, respectively. There are also C grades.

Bonds rated triple A (AAA or Aaa) are said to be prime; double A (AA or Aa) are of high quality; single A issues are called upper medium grade; and triple B are medium grade. Lower-rated bonds are said to have speculative elements or be distinctly speculative.

All rating agencies use rating modifiers to provide a narrower credit quality breakdown within each rating category. S&P and Fitch use a rating modifier of plus and minus. Moody's uses 1, 2, and 3 as its rating modifiers.

Bond issues that are assigned a rating in the top four categories are referred to as investment-grade bonds. Issues that carry a rating below the top four categories are referred to as noninvestment-grade bonds or speculative bonds, or more popularly as high-yield bonds or junk bonds. Thus, the corporate bond market can be divided into two sectors: the investment-grade and noninvestment-grade markets.

A bond issue may be assigned a "dual" rating if there is a feature of the bond that rating agencies believe would alter the credit risk. For example, Standard & Poor's assigns a dual rating to putable bonds. The first rating is the normal rating based on the likelihood of repayment of principal and interest as due in the absence of the put feature. The second rating reflects the ability of the issuer to repay the principal at the put date if the bondholder exercises the put option.

# The Rating Process

The rating process involves the analysis of a multitude of quantitative and qualitative factors over the past, present, and future. Ratings should be prospective because future operations should provide the wherewithal to repay the debt. The ratings apply to the particular issue, not the issuer. While bond analysts rely on numbers and calculate many ratios to get a picture of the company's debt-servicing capacity, a rating is only an opinion or judgment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its obligations when due, whether during prosperity or during times of stress. The purpose of ratings is to rank issues in terms of the probability of default, taking into account the special features of the issue, the relationship to other obligations of the issuer, and current and prospective financial conditions, and operating performance.

In conducting its examination, the rating agencies consider the four Cs of credit—character, capacity, collateral, and covenants. The first of the Cs stands for character of management, the foundation of sound credit. In assessing management quality, the analysts at Moody's, for example, try to understand the business strategies and policies formulated by management. Following are factors that are considered: strategic direction, financial philosophy, conservatism, track record, succession planning, and control systems.

The next C is capacity or the ability of an issuer to repay its obligations. In assessing the ability of an issuer to pay, an analysis of the financial statements is undertaken. In addition to management quality, the factors examined by Moody's, for example, are industry trends, the regulatory environment, basic operating and competitive position, financial position and sources of liquidity, company structure (including structural subordination and priority of claim), and parent company support agreements.

The third C, collateral, is looked at not only in the traditional sense of assets pledged to secure the debt, but also to the quality and value of those unpledged assets controlled by the issuer. In both senses the collateral is capable of supplying additional aid, comfort, and support to the debt and the debtholder. Assets form the basis for the generation of cash flow that services the debt in good times as well as bad.

The final C is for covenants, the terms and conditions of the lending agreement. As discussed earlier, covenants lay down restrictions on how management operates the company and conducts its financial affairs.

Ratings of bonds change over time. Issuers are upgraded when their likelihood of default (as assessed by the rating company) decreases, and downgraded when their likelihood of default (as assessed by the rating company) increases. The rating companies publish the issues that they are reviewing for possible rating change.

To help investors understand how ratings change over time, the rating agencies publish this information periodically in the form of a table. This table is called a rating transition matrix. The table is useful for investors to assess potential downgrades and upgrades. A rating transition matrix is available for different holding periods. Typically these tables show that for investment-grade bonds, the probability of a downgrade is much higher than for an upgrade. Second, the longer the transition period, the lower the probability that an issue will retain its original rating.

# SPECULATIVE-GRADE BONDS

Speculative-grade bonds are those rated below investment grade by the rating agencies (i.e., BB+ and lower by Fitch and S&P, and Ba1 and less by Moody's). They may also be unrated, but not all unrated debt is speculative. Also known as junk bonds, promoters have given these securities other euphemisms such as high-interest bonds, high-opportunity debt, and high-yield securities. While some of these terms may be misleading to the uninitiated, they are used throughout the investment world, with "junk" and "high yield" the most popular. We will also use "junk" and "high yield" in this chapter.


Speculative-grade bonds may not be high-yielders at all because they may not be paying any interest, and there may be little hope for the resumption of interest payments; even the return expected from a reorganization or liquidation may be low. Some high-yield instruments may not be speculative-grade at all because they may carry investment-grade ratings. The higher yields may be due to fears of premature redemption of high-coupon bonds in a lower interest rate environment. The higher yields may be caused by a sharp decline in the securities markets, which has driven down the prices of all issues, including those with investment merit.

While the term "junk" tarnishes the entire less-than-investment-grade spectrum, it is applicable to some specific situations. Junk bonds are not useless stuff, trash, or rubbish as the term would imply. At times, investors overpay for their speculative-grade securities so they feel that they may have purchased junk or worthless garbage. But this is also the case when they have overpaid for high-grade securities. There are other times when profits may be made from buying junk bonds; certainly then, these bonds are not junk but something that may be quite attractive. Also, not all securities in this low-grade sector of the market are on the verge of default or bankruptcy. Many issuers might be on the fringe of the investment-grade sector. Market participants should be discriminating in the choice of their terminology.

# Types of Issuers

Several types of issuers fall into the less-than-investment-grade high-yield category. These include original issuers, fallen angels, and restructuring and leveraged buyouts.

Original issuers may be young, growing corporations lacking the stronger balance sheet and income statement profile of many established corporations, but often with lots of promise. Also called venture capital situations or growth or emerging market companies, the debt is often sold with a story projecting future financial strength. From this we get the term "story bond." There are also the established operating firms with financials neither measuring up to the strengths of investment-grade corporations nor possessing the weaknesses of companies on the verge of bankruptcy.

Fallen angels are formerly companies with investment-grade-rated debt that have come upon hard times with deteriorating balance sheet and income statement financial parameters. They may be in default or near bankruptcy. In these cases, investors are interested in the workout value of the debt in a reorganization or liquidation, whether within or outside of the bankruptcy courts. Some refer to these issues as "special situations."

Restructurings and leveraged buyouts are companies that have deliberately increased their debt burden with a view toward maximizing shareholder value. The shareholders may be the existing public group to which the company pays a special extraordinary dividend, with the funds coming from borrowings and the sale of assets. Cash is paid out, net worth decreased and leverage increased, and ratings drop on existing debt. Newly issued debt gets junk bond status because of the company's weakened financial condition.

In a leveraged buyout (LBO), a new and private shareholder group owns and manages the company. The debt issue's purpose may be to retire other debt from commercial and investment banks and institutional investors incurred to finance the LBO. The debt to be retired is called "bridge financing" because it provides a bridge between the initial LBO activity and the more permanent financing.

# Unique Features of Some Issues

Often actions taken by management that result in the assignment of a noninvestment-grade bond rating result in a heavy interest payment burden. This places severe cash flow constraints on the firm. To reduce this burden, firms involved with heavy debt burdens have issued bonds with deferred coupon structures that permit the issuer to avoid using cash to make interest payments for a period of 3 to 7 years. There are three types of deferred coupon structures: (1) deferred-interest bonds, (2) step-up bonds, and (3) payment-in-kind bonds.

Deferred-interest bonds are the most common type of deferred coupon structure. These bonds sell at a deep discount and do not pay interest for an initial period, typically from 3 to 7 years. (Because no interest is paid for the initial period, these bonds are sometimes referred to as zero-coupon bonds.) Step-up bonds do pay coupon interest, but the coupon rate is low for an initial period and then increases ("steps up") to a higher coupon rate. Finally, payment-in-kind (PIK) bonds give the issuer an option to pay cash at a coupon payment date or give the bondholder a similar bond (i.e., a bond with the same coupon rate and a par value equal to the amount of the coupon payment that would have been paid). The period during which the issuer can make this choice varies from 5 to 10 years.


An extendible reset bond is a bond structure that allows the issuer to reset the coupon rate so that the bond will trade at a predetermined price. The coupon rate may reset annually or even more frequently, or reset only one time over the life of the bond. Generally, the coupon rate at the reset date will be the average of rates suggested by two investment banking firms. The new rate will then reflect (1) the level of interest rates at the reset date and (2) the credit spread the market wants on the issue at the reset date. The difference between an extendible reset bond and a floating-rate bond is that for the latter the coupon rate resets according to a fixed spread over the reference rate, with the index spread specified in the indenture. The amount of the index spread reflects market conditions at the time the issue is offered. The coupon rate on an extendible reset bond, in contrast, is reset based on market conditions (as suggested by several investment banking firms) at the time of the reset date. Moreover, the new coupon rate reflects the new level of interest rates and the new spread that investors seek.

The advantage to investors of extendible reset bonds is that the coupon rate will reset to the market rate—both the level of interest rates and the credit spread—in principle keeping the issue at par value. In fact, experience with extendible reset bonds has not been favorable during the recent period of difficulties in the high-yield bond market.

"Clawback provisions" in speculative-grade bond issues grant the issuer a limited right to redeem a portion of the bonds during the non-call period if the proceeds are from an initial public stock offering. The disadvantage of a clawback provision for the investor is that the bonds can be called at a point in time just when the issuer's finances have been strengthened through access to the equity market.

# Default and Recovery Statistics

We conclude our discussion of high-yield corporate bonds with a discussion of default and recovery statistics. From an investment perspective, default rates by themselves are not of paramount significance: it is perfectly possible for a portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to suffer defaults and to outperform Treasuries at the same time, provided the yield spread of the portfolio is sufficiently high to offset the losses from default.

Furthermore, because holders of defaulted bonds typically recover a percentage of the face amount of their investment, the default loss rate can be substantially lower than the default rate. The default loss rate is defined as follows:


default loss rate  $=$  default rate  $\times$  recovery rate

For example, a default rate of  $5\%$  and a recovery rate of  $30\%$  means a default loss rate of only  $3.5\%$  ( $70\%$  of  $5\%$ ).

Therefore, focusing exclusively on default rates merely highlights the worst possible outcome that a diversified portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds would suffer, assuming all defaulted bonds would be totally worthless.

In their 1987 study, Altman and Nammacher found that the annual default rate for low-rated corporate debt was  $2.15\%$ , a figure that Altman has updated since to  $2.40\%$ . The firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert (DBL), a major issuer of high-yield bonds at one time, also estimated default rates of about  $2.40\%$  per year. Asquith, Mullins, and Wolff, however, found that nearly one out of every three high-yield corporate bonds defaults. The large discrepancy arises because the studies use three different definitions of "default rate"; even if applied to the same universe of bonds (which they are not), all three results could be valid simultaneously.

Altman and Nammacher define the default rate as the par value of all high-yield bonds that defaulted in a given calendar year, divided by the total par value outstanding during the year. Their estimates (2.15\% and 2.40\%) are simple averages of the annual default rates over a number of years. DBL took the cumulative dollar value of all defaulted high-yield bonds, divided by the cumulative dollar value of all high-yield issuance, and further divided by the weighted average number of years outstanding to obtain an average annual default rate. Asquith, Mullins, and Wolff use a cumulative default statistic. For all bonds issued in a given year, the default rate is the total par value of defaulted issues as of the date of their study, divided by the total par amount originally issued to obtain a cumulative default rate. Their result (that about one in three high-yield bonds default) is not normalized by the number of years outstanding.

Although all three measures are useful indicators of bond default propensity, they are not directly comparable. Even when restated on an annualized basis, they do not all measure the same quantity. The default statistics from all studies, however, are surprisingly similar once cumulative rates have been annualized. Altman and Kishore find for the period 1971 to 1997 that the arithmetic average default rate for the entire period was  $2.6\%$ , and the weighted average default rate (i.e., weighted by the par value of the amount outstanding for each year) was  $3.3\%$ . For a more recent time period, 1985 to 1997, the arithmetic average default rate was higher,  $3.7\%$ .[8]

Next let's look at the historical loss rate realized by investors in high-yield corporate bonds. Just as with default rates, there are different methodologies that can be used to compute recovery rates. For example, the methodology for computing the default loss rate by Altman and Kishore is as follows. First, the default loss of principal is computed by multiplying the default rate for the year by the average loss of principal. The average loss of principal is computed by first determining the recovery per  $100 of par value. They quantify the recovery per$ 100 of par value using the weighted average price of all issues after default. The difference between par value of 100 and the recovery of principal is the default loss of principal.

Several studies have found that the recovery rate is closely related to the bond's seniority. Altman and Kishore computed the weighted average recovery rate for 777 bond issues that defaulted between 1978 and 1997 for the following bond classes: (1) senior-secured, (2) senior-unsecured, (3) senior-subordinated, (4) subordinated, and (5) discount and zero-coupon. The recovery rate for senior-secured bonds averaged  $59\%$  of face value, compared with  $49\%$  for senior-unsecured,  $35\%$  for senior-subordinated, and  $32\%$  for subordinated bonds.

# CORPORATE BOND INDEXES

The three broad-based U.S. bond market indexes are the Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate Index, the Salomon Smith Barney (SSB) Broad Investment-Grade Bond Index (BIG), and the Merrill Lynch Domestic Market Index. The three broad-based U.S. bond market indexes are computed daily and are "market-value weighted." This means that for each issue, the ratio of the market value of an issue relative to the market value of all issues in the index is used as the weight of the issue in all calculations.


Each index is broken into sectors. The Lehman index, for example, is divided into the following six sectors: (1) Treasury sector, (2) agency sector, (3) mortgage passthrough sector, (4) commercial mortgage-backed securities sector, (5) asset-backed securities sector, and (6) credit sector. The credit sector in the Lehman Brothers index includes corporate issues. In all three indexes, the only issues that are included are investment-grade issues.

The three investment banking firms that created the broad-based bond market indexes have also created separate high-yield indexes. In addition, the firms of CS First Boston and Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette have created indexes for this sector. The number of issues included in each high-yield index varies from index to index. The types of issues permitted (e.g., convertible, floating-rate, payment-in-kind) also varies.

# MEDIUM-TERM NOTES

Medium-term notes (MTNs) are debt instruments with the unique characteristic that they are offered continuously to investors by an agent of the issuer. Investors can select from several maturity ranges: 9 months to 1 year, more than 1 year to 18 months, more than 18 months to 2 years, and so on up to any number of years. MTNs are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Rule 415 (the "shelf registration rule"), which gives a corporation the maximum flexibility for issuing securities on a continuous basis. MTNs are also issued by foreign corporations, federal agencies, supranational institutions, and foreign countries. The MTN market is primarily institutional, with individual investors being of little import.

The term "medium-term note" to describe this corporate debt instrument is misleading. Traditionally, the term "note" or "medium-term" was used to refer to debt issues with a maturity greater than 1 year but less than 15 years. Certainly this is not a characteristic of MTNs since they have been sold with maturities from 9 months to 30 years, and even longer. For example, in July 1993, Walt Disney Corporation issued a security with a 100-year maturity off its medium-term note shelf registration.

Borrowers have flexibility in designing MTNs to satisfy their own needs. They can issue fixed- or floating-rate debt. The coupon payments can be denominated in U.S. dollars or in a foreign currency.

An issuer with an active MTN program will post the rates for the maturity ranges it wishes to sell. The purchaser may usually set the maturity as any business day within the offered maturity range, subject to the borrower's approval. This is a very important benefit of MTNs because it enables a lender to match maturities with its own specific requirements. As they are continuously offered, an investor can enter the market when portfolio needs require and will usually find suitable investment opportunities.


There are issuers of MTNs that couple their offerings with transactions in the derivative markets (options, futures/forwards, swaps, caps, and floors) to create debt obligations with more interesting risk/return features than are available in the corporate bond market. These are called structured notes. Structured notes allow institutional investors who are restricted to investing in investment-grade debt issues the opportunity to participate in other asset classes to make a market play. For example, an investor who buys an MTN whose coupon rate is tied to the performance of the S&P 500 is participating in the equity market without owning common stock. If the coupon rate is tied to a foreign stock index, the investor is participating in the equity market of a foreign country without owning foreign common stocks.

# YIELD AND YIELD SPREADS

Corporate bond yields trade at a spread (i.e., a higher yield) over Treasury securities with the same maturity (or duration). The spread reflects the credit risk and liquidity risk associated with corporate bonds relative to Treasury securities. The size of the spread varies over time depending on the market's expectation regarding the concerns with defaults. For example, yield spreads for corporates tend to widen (i.e., increase) in recessions and narrow (i.e., decrease) in prosperous economic periods. At a given point in time, the spread varies with the credit rating. Specifically, the lower the credit rating of a corporate bond, the greater the spread. So, for example, a double A rated corporate bond will offer a lower spread than a single A rated corporate bond.

For corporate bonds that are callable, a portion of the spread reflects the call risk associated with holding a callable corporate bond relative to a Treasury security with a comparable maturity. The measure commonly used for a spread that adjusts for the risks associated with a bond being called is the option-adjusted spread.

Exhibit 11.2 shows the spread over Treasuries for corporate bonds issued by industrial, utility, finance, and bank entities as reported by Lehman Brothers. The spreads are for bullet issues (i.e., issues that are noncallable for life) and are reported by maturity and credit rating. The exhibit shows the 90-day high, low, and average for the week ending

September 7, 2001. Basically, it is a term structure of credit spreads. For callable and putable securities, an option-adjusted spread is calculated. Exhibit 11.3 shows the estimated spread for the 20 largest issuers in the credit sector of the Lehman Brothers Index on September 7, 2001. Exhibit 11.4 shows the approximate spreads for the largest issues in the Lehman High Yield Index on the same date.

Within the corporate bond market there is a spread based on maturity for issues of the same credit quality. For example, 1-year single A corporate bonds will offer a different spread than 10-year single A corporate bonds. In the Treasury securities market we saw this type of relationship between yield and maturity which in graphical form is called the Treasury yield curve. There are corporate yield curves by credit rating. That is, there is a AAA corporate yield curve and a BBB corporate yield curve. Typically credit spread increases with maturity. In addition, the shape of the yield curve is not the same for all credit ratings. The lower the credit rating, typically, the steeper the yield curve. For each corporate yield curve, a corporate yield spread curve by credit rating can be obtained by simply subtracting the corresponding yield on the Treasury yield curve.

# CONVERTIBLE BONDS

A convertible bond is a corporate bond issue that can be converted into common stock at the option of the bondholder. We conclude this chapter with a description of the basic features of convertible bonds and their investment characteristics.

# Basic Features of Convertible Bonds

The conversion provision of a bond grants the bondholder the right to convert the security into a predetermined number of shares of common stock of the issuer. An exchangeable bond grants the bondholder the right to exchange the security for the common stock of a firm other than the issuer of the security. In our discussion, we use the term convertible bond to refer to both convertible and exchangeable bonds.

# Conversion Ratio

The number of shares of common stock that the bondholder will receive from exercising the call option of a convertible bond is called the conversion ratio. The conversion privilege may extend for all or only some portion of the bond's life, and the stated conversion ratio may change over time. It is always adjusted proportionately for stock splits and stock dividends.

For example, suppose that the Izzobaf Corporation issued a convertible bond with a conversion ratio of 25.32 shares. This means that for each 1,000 of par value of this issue the bondholder exchanges for Izzobaf's common stock, he will receive 25.32 shares.

At the time of issuance of a convertible bond, the issuer effectively grants the bondholder the right to purchase the common stock at a price equal to:

This price is referred to in the prospectus as the stated conversion price. Sometimes the issue price of a convertible bond may not be equal to par. In such cases, the stated conversion price at issuance is usually determined by the issue price.

The stated conversion price for the Izzobaf convertible issue is:

$$
\text {S t a t e d c o n v e r s i o n p r i c e} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 , 0 0 0}{2 5 . 3 2} = \mathbb {S} 3 9. 4 9
$$

# Call Provisions

Almost all convertible issues are callable by the issuer. Typically there is a noncall period (i.e., a time period from the time of issuance that the convertible bond may not be called). Some issues have a provisional call feature that allows the issuer to call the issue during the noncall period if the stock reaches a certain price.

# Put Provision

A put option grants the bondholder the right to require the issuer to redeem the issue at designated dates for a predetermined price. Some convertible bonds are putable. Put options can be classified as "hard" puts and "soft" puts. A hard put is one in which the convertible bond must be redeemed by the issuer only for cash. In the case of a soft put, the issuer has the option to redeem the convertible bond for cash, common stock, subordinated notes, or a combination of the three.

# Traditional Analysis of Convertible Bonds

There have been sophisticated models for valuing corporate bonds using option pricing theory since a convertible bond has several embedded options—the right to convert by the bondholder, the right to call by the issuer, and, if the issue is putable, the right to put the issue by the bondholder. In this section we discuss the traditional analysis used to analyze convertible bonds so that their investment characteristics can be appreciated.

# Minimum Value of a Convertible Bond

The conversion value or parity value of a convertible bond is the value of the security if it is converted immediately. That is,

Conversion value = Market price of common stock × Conversion ratio

The minimum price of a convertible bond is the greater of

1. Its conversion value, or
2. Its value as a security without the conversion option—that is, based on the convertible bond's cash flows if not converted. This value is called its straight value or investment value.

If the convertible bond does not sell for the greater of these two values, arbitrage profits could be realized. For example, suppose the conversion value is greater than the straight value, and the convertible bond is selling at its straight value. An investor can buy the convertible bond at the straight value and convert it. By doing so, the investor realizes a gain equal to the difference between the conversion value and the straight value. Suppose, instead, the straight value is greater than the conversion value, and the convertible bond is selling at its conversion value. By buying the convertible bond at the conversion value, the investor will realize a higher yield than a comparable straight security.

To illustrate, assuming that the market price per share of Izzobaf's common stock is currently  $33, then for Izzobaf's convertible issue the conversion value per$ 1,000 of par value is equal to:

$$
\text {C o n v e r s i o n v a l u e} = \$ 3 3 \times 2 5. 3 2 = \$ 8 3 5. 5 6
$$

Therefore, the conversion value per $100 of par value is $83.556.

Suppose that given the appropriate yield for a straight bond issued by Izzobaf's convertible would result in a straight price of $98.19 per $100 par value. Since the minimum value of the Izzobaf convertible bond is the greater of the conversion value and the straight value, the minimum value is 98.19.

# Market Conversion Price

The price that an investor effectively pays for the common stock if the convertible bond is purchased and then converted into the common stock is called the market conversion price or conversion parity price. It is found as follows:

$$
\text {M a r k e t c o n v e r s i o n p r i c e} = \frac {\text {M a r k e t p r i c e o f c o n v e r t i b l e b o n d}}{\text {C o n v e r s i o n r a t i o}}
$$

The market conversion price is a useful benchmark because once the actual market price of the stock rises above the market conversion price, any further stock price increase is certain to increase the value of the convertible bond by at least the same percentage. Therefore, the market conversion price can be viewed as a breakeven price.

An investor who purchases a convertible bond rather than the underlying stock pays a premium over the current market price of the stock. This premium per share is equal to the difference between the market conversion price and the current market price of the common stock. That is,

Market conversion premium per share
= Market conversion price - Current market price

The market conversion premium per share is usually expressed as a percentage of the current market price as follows:

$$
\text {M a r k e t c o n v e r s i o n p r e m i u m r a t i o} = \frac {\text {M a r k e t c o n v e r s i o n p r e m i u m p e r s h a r e}}{\text {M a r k e t p r i c e o f c o m m o n s t o c k}}
$$

Why would someone be willing to pay a premium to buy the stock? Recall that the minimum price of a convertible bond is the greater of its conversion value or its straight value. Thus, as the common stock price declines, the price of the convertible bond will not fall below its straight value. The straight value therefore acts as a floor for the convertible bond's price. The straight value at some future date, however, is unknown; the value will change as interest rates in the market change.

Assuming the following for the Izzobaf convertible bond:

Market price per  $1,000 of par value =$ 1,065.00

Conversion ratio  $= 25.32$

Then the calculation of the market conversion price, market conversion premium per share, and market conversion premium ratio for the Izzobaf convertible bond is shown below:

$$
\text {M a r k e t c o n v e r s i o n p r i c e} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 1 , 0 6 5}{2 5 . 3 2} = \mathbb {S} 4 2. 0 6
$$

Market conversion premium per share =  $42.06 -$ 33 = 9.06

Market conversion premium ratio = \frac{9.06}{33} = 0.275 or 27.5\%

# Current Income of Convertible Bond versus Common Stock

As an offset to the market conversion premium per share, investing in the convertible bond rather than buying the stock directly generally means that the investor realizes higher current income from the coupon interest paid than would be received as common stock dividends paid on the number of shares equal to the conversion ratio. Investors evaluating a convertible bond typically compute the time it takes to recover the premium per share by computing the premium payback period (which is also known as the breakeven time). This is computed as follows:

# Market conversion premium per share Favorable income differential per share where the favorable income differential per share is equal to the following for a convertible bond:


Coupon interest - (Conversion ratio  $\times$  Common stock dividend per share)

# Conversion ratio

The premium payback period does not take into account the time value of money.

Assume for the Izzobaf convertible bond, the coupon rate is  $5.75\%$ . We know that the market conversion premium per share is 9.06. The favorable income differential per share is found as follows:

Coupon interest from bond = 0.0575 \times \1,000 = \$57.50

Conversion ratio  $\times$  Dividend per share  $= 25.32 \times \0.90 = \$ 22.79  Therefore,

Favorable income differential per share =  $\frac{\$57.50 - \$22.79}{25.32} = \$1.37$ and


$$
\text {P r e m i u m p a y b a c k p e r i o d} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 9 . 0 6}{\mathbb {S} 1 . 3 7} = 6. 6 \text {y e a r s}
$$

Without considering the time value of money, the investor would recover the market conversion premium per share in about 7 years.

# Downside Risk with a Convertible Bond

Investors usually use the straight value as a measure of the downside risk of a convertible bond because the price of the convertible bond cannot fall below this value. Thus, the straight value acts as the current floor for the price of the convertible bond. The downside risk is measured as a percentage of the straight value and computed as follows:

$$
\text {P r e m u i m o v e r s t r a i g h t v a l u e} = \frac {\text {M a r k e t p r i c e o f t h e c o n v e r t i b l e b o n d}}{\text {S t r a i g h t v a l u e}} - 1
$$

The higher the premium over straight value, all other factors constant, the less attractive the convertible bond.

Despite its use in practice, this measure of downside risk is flawed because the straight value (the floor) changes as interest rates change. If interest rates rise, the straight value falls, making the floor fall. Therefore, the downside risk changes as interest rates change.

For our hypothetical convertible bond, the Izzobaf bond, since the market price of the convertible bond is $106.5 and the straight value is $98.19, the premium over straight value is:

$$
\text{Premium over straight value} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 106.5}{\mathbb {S} 98.19} - 1 = 0.085 \text {or} 8.5 \%
$$

# The Upside Potential of a Convertible Bond

The evaluation of the upside potential of a convertible bond depends on the prospects for the underlying common stock. Thus, the techniques for analyzing common stocks on equity analysis should be employed.

# Investment Characteristics of a Convertible Bond

The investment characteristics of a convertible bond depend on the common stock price. If the price is low, so that the straight value is considerably higher than the conversion value, the security will trade much like a straight bond. The convertible bond in such instances is referred to as a bond equivalent or a busted convertible.

When the price of the stock is such that the conversion value is considerably higher than the straight value, then the convertible bond will trade as if it were an equity instrument; in this case it is said to be a common stock equivalent. In such cases, the market conversion premium per share will be small.

Between these two cases, bond equivalent and common stock equivalent, the convertible bond trades as a hybrid security, having the characteristics of both a bond and common stock.

# The Risk/Return Profile of a Convertible Bond

Let's use the Izzobaf convertible bond to compare the risk/return profile from investing in a convertible bond or the underlying common stock. The stock can be purchased in the market for $33. By buying the convertible bond, the investor is effectively purchasing the stock for $42.06 (the market conversion price per share). Let's look at the potential profit and loss, assuming that Izzobaf's stock price rises to $50 and a scenario in which the stock price falls to $25.

If the stock price rises to $50, the direct purchase of the stock would generate a profit of $17 per share ($50 - $33), or a return of 34\%. If the convertible bond is purchased, the conversion value is $1,266 per $1,000 of par value (conversion ratio of 25.32 times $50). Assuming that the straight value per $1,000 of par value is unchanged at $981.90, the minimum value for the convertible bond is $1,266. Since the initial price of the convertible bond per  $1,000 of par value is$ 1,065, the profit is  $201, and the return is 18.9\% ($ 201/ $1,065). The lower return by buying the convertible bond rather than the stock is because a higher price was effectively paid for the stock. Specifically, by buying the convertible bond, a per share price of$ 42.06 was paid. The profit per share is then $7.94, which produces the return of 18.9\% ( $7.94/42.06).


Now let's look at what would happen if Izzobaf's stock price declines to $25. If the stock is purchased, there would be a loss of $8 per share or, equivalently, a return of -24\%. For the convertible bond, the conversion value would be $633 (conversion ratio of 25.3 times $25). However, the convertible bond's minimum price is the greater of the convertible bond value and the straight value. Assuming the straight value stays at $981.90, this would be the value of the convertible bond. The loss on the convertible bond is therefore $83.10 or 7.8\% ($83.10/$1,065).

One of the critical assumptions in this analysis is that the straight value does not change except for the passage of time. If interest rates rise, the straight value will decline. Even if interest rates do not rise, the perceived creditworthiness of the issuer may deteriorate, causing investors to demand a higher yield.

The scenario clearly demonstrates that there are benefits and drawbacks to investing in convertible bonds. The disadvantage is the upside potential given up because a premium per share must be paid. An advantage is the reduction in downside risk (as determined by the straight value).
