Emerging markets debt (EMD) warrants consideration in diversified portfolios based upon its normal return potential, risk characteristics, and portfolio diversification benefits. Fundamental investment analysis of this market requires an understanding of sovereign credit risk and the compositional complexities of the emerging market bonds themselves. The normal return potential of the market, in conjunction with its low correlation to other bond and equity markets, offers the opportunity to improve a portfolio's risk/reward profile.

In the broadest sense, the group of emerging countries includes all nations not considered industrialized or already "developed." Since the latter group has only two dozen or so members, the emerging country universe encompasses most of the world's population and geography. However, because most emerging countries have no investable debt securities, only a subset of these countries comprises the emerging markets debt universe. Hence, the more precise terminology is emerging market, rather than emerging country.


While convention and market terminology lump all of these countries into one market, there are profound, fundamental differences among them. Many Latin American countries have a history of poor macroeconomic management and suffer from deep social inequality, but their recent economic performances have largely improved. Eastern Europe is recovering from decades of central planning, but some countries have pre-war histories of success with capitalism. Opening these markets up to the rest of the world has the potential of producing large growth rates. Africa is generally income-poor, but commodity-rich. Finally, a number of Southeastern Asian countries have very high savings rates, resulting in exportation rather than importation of capital. As more emerging countries develop sovereign bond markets, interregional and inter-country differences will expand diversification opportunities, improving the risk/return profile of the asset class.

Emerging market issuers rely on international investors for capital. Emerging markets cannot finance their fiscal deficits domestically because domestic capital markets are poorly developed and local investors are unable or unwilling to lend to the government. Although emerging market issuers differ greatly in terms of credit risk, dependence on foreign capital is the most basic characteristic of the asset class. After the Asian crisis in 1997, investors realized that even investment-grade sovereign issuers can run into problems when access to foreign capital is constrained.

The growth of emerging market economies and the greater reliance of emerging markets on bond financing lead to an increase in importance of developing countries' debt securities in the international marketplace. While still small in comparison to that of industrialized country debt, the overall size of the market (see Exhibit 13.1) has expanded from  $1.4\%$  of the World Bond Market in 1993 to  $4.8\%$  in 2000, making it an important sector of the global capital market. From 1992 to 2000, total trading volume of EMD securities has quadrupled (see Exhibit 13.2). In this chapter we review EMD generally, examine different security structures, and provide some perspective on the long-term and current attractiveness of this asset class.

# EMERGING MARKETS DEBT INSTRUMENTS

Sovereign EMD instruments can be divided into three segments: Brady bonds, Eurobonds, and local issues. The characteristics and histories of these market segments are examined in this section. This section also discusses emerging market corporate bonds and popular index alternatives.

Most emerging market bonds are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, Euro-denominated issuance has grown from  $17\%$  of total EMD issuance in 1997 to  $31\%$  of total issuance in 2000.[2] Euro-denominated EMD securities are typically held in retail accounts, have lower issuance size and are less liquid than comparable U.S. dollar-denominated bonds.

Due to relative illiquidity and less attractive spreads of Euro-denominated EMD, U.S.-based emerging markets debt investors hold the bulk of their assets in U.S. dollar-denominated securities. Unlike emerging market equity and developed foreign bond markets, direct currency risk (i.e., the risk of foreign exchange losses) is not a major consideration for a U.S.-based investor. U.S. interest rate risk, however, is important to the sovereign market just as it is to the U.S. high yield and corporate bond markets. Trading occurs primarily in New York and secondarily in London. Most issues settle via the ordinary Euroclear mechanism; costly local custody arrangements are unnecessary. So while the sovereign market has several characteristics in common with traditional U.S. bond markets, it remains unique in nature due to sovereign default risk.

# The Brady Plan and Resulting Bonds

Narrowly defined, the Brady Plan refers to an innovative debt renegotiation format, whereby defaulted sovereign bank loans were written down and converted into bonds; the bonds themselves also have unique structures. Mexico was the first Brady Plan participant in 1989. More broadly, the Brady Plan encompasses the entire set of economic policy prescriptions that developing countries adopted in order to receive additional international aid. This aid allowed them to meet their responsibilities under the Brady Plan.

The Brady Plan differed from previous approaches in a number of respects. For the first time, underlying structural problems of the debtor countries were addressed (such as protected markets and controlled prices). Typically, the principal amount of the defaulted loans was effectively reduced by  $35\%$  to  $50\%$ ; sometimes interest and interest arrears were also reduced. This principal forgiveness had the effect of both raising the loans' value in the secondary market and lowering the borrowers' debt burden. Further, the commercial banks' loans to private and sovereign entities were transformed into sovereign bonds, thus enhancing their appeal to investors. Exhibit 13.3 shows the debt reduction obtained by some countries that participated in a Brady Plan restructuring.

The features of Brady bonds vary. Most were issued with a final maturity between 10 and 30 years and have semiannual coupons; many Brady bonds have amortizing principal payments. Coupons may be fixed, floating, step-up or a hybrid combination. Unique features such as principal collateral, rolling interest guarantees, and value recovery rights were added to Brady bonds in order to improve creditworthiness and attract investors.

U.S. Treasury zero-coupon securities were purchased to serve as collateral for a bond's principal payment. High quality money market instruments were purchased to serve as collateral for the rolling interest guarantee. Rolling interest guarantees cover either two or three coupon payments; after a coupon payment is made, the guarantee rolls to cover the next set of coupon payments. If the collateral is used, the issuer has no obligation to replace it. Due to collateralization, Brady bonds require special analytical methods to calculate basic bond statistics; these methods are discussed later in this chapter.

Value recovery rights provide the investor with additional upside if the debt service capacity of the debtor improves. Some value recovery rights are known as oil warrants because their value is linked to a country's oil export receipts. Large oil exporters (Mexico, Nigeria, Venezuela) attached oil warrants to some of their Brady bonds. Other countries, such as Bulgaria, enhanced some Brady bonds with value recovery rights whose value was linked to GDP growth.

Exhibit 13.4 describes the most common types of Brady bonds. Brady bonds still command a large portion of EMD trading volume. However, since new debt is raised in the Eurobond format, the relative importance of Brady bonds will decline over time.

The Brady Plan is generally associated with overall economic improvement in the participating countries, but it is not clear that the Plan caused this improvement. Perhaps alternative debt resolutions would also have led to economic gains, or perhaps positive global economic trends were more important than the Plan itself. While the economic ramifications of the Brady Plan may be debated, it was instrumental in launching a new debt market.


# Eurobonds

Eurobonds are internationally issued securities denominated in hard currencies. Most Eurobonds have a fixed coupon and a bullet maturity.

As a portion of trading volume, Eurobonds now make up the largest portion of the emerging debt market. The importance of Eurobonds will continue to increase because new debt is raised in the Eurobond format and countries opportunistically exchange Brady debt for Eurobonds. Exchanging Brady bonds for Eurobonds is attractive if a country can issue Eurobonds for lower yields than existing Brady bonds. In some cases, countries have chosen to exchange Brady bonds for Eurobonds in order to receive cash flow savings through lower coupons/amortizations or to release the treasury collateral backing certain Bradys.

Eurobonds were serviced during the 1980s bank loan crisis. A possible motivation behind such an admirable repayment history may have been that these obligations were small compared to bank debt, so that defaulting on them was much less economical. A second possible motivation may derive from the unique nature of bonds relative to loans. Debt restructuring negotiations of loans are easier because loans involve a small, easily identified and relatively homogeneous group of creditors, i.e., banks. It is difficult for a bank to not restructure its loan to a country and to free-ride on other banks' willingness to do so. By contrast, bond holders are a large and diverse group with no incentives to stay on good terms with the country. This makes broad approval of a bond restructuring more difficult.

Both Eurobonds and Brady bonds are held by a diverse group of creditors, however there is a market perception that distressed sovereign issuers could try to selectively default on Bradys while they continue to service Eurobonds. Since Eurobonds represent the structure of future issuance, a selective default will allow a sovereign to maintain some type of reputation in the capital markets.

The recent growth of the Eurobond market makes future preferential treatment less likely. Since Eurobonds are now a larger portion of a sovereign's total debt, future restructurings are likely to include Eurobonds in order to meaningfully decrease a country's debt burden. The recent restructuring of Ecuadorian bonds (Eurobonds and Bradys) took approximately a year from the time of default suggesting that sovereign restructurings are possible despite a diverse group of bond holders. In addition,

Ecuador was unable to selectively default on its Bradys; it restructured both Eurobonds and Brady bonds.

# Local Issues

Several developing countries have functioning and relatively liquid domestic debt markets. Local issues are issued under local law. The bulk of local issues are denominated in local currencies, but a large portion is denominated in major currencies (USD, Euro, Yen) or linked to a major currency. Because of historically high and variable inflation rates and volatile exchange rates, most emerging market, local currency-denominated bonds are short-term instruments. Besides evaluating direct currency risk, international investors need to be compensated for the lack of protection offered by local laws and potential settlement difficulties. Foreign investor interest may grow as governance of local financial markets improves, but the 1998 Russian Treasury bill (GKO) default will be a reminder that hinders investor enthusiasm.

# Corporate Bonds

The risk analysis of an EMD corporation hinges on its ownership type and its sensitivity to domestic economy. EMD corporations may be owned by the sovereign, an established multinational or have local ownership. A corporation may sell its product domestically (e.g., a cable operator) or it may earn hard-currency by exporting its product (e.g., an oil company).

Rating agencies have historically limited a corporation's debt rating to its country's sovereign credit rating because corporate debt manifests specific corporate business risk in addition to the sovereign risk of its government. In effect, a sovereign ceiling limited a corporation's credit ratings. The theory behind the sovereign ceiling is that the sovereign entity ultimately controls the corporation's access to foreign currency and its tax burden. Essentially, the corporation depends on a benevolent legal and institutional framework from the sovereign government and, therefore, is never a better credit risk than the sovereign itself.

Recently, both Standard and Poor's and Moody's have weakened the sovereign ceiling by allowing certain corporates to receive ratings above their sovereign ceiling. Standard and Poor's sometimes rates corporations above their respective sovereign ceiling if they operate in highly dollarized economies, if they are geographically diversified, or if they have offshore parent support or structural enhancements. Moody's allows corporates to be rated above the sovereign ceiling if there are external support mechanisms (i.e., support from a multinational parent), if there is a low chance of a moratorium in the event of a sovereign default, and if the borrower has access to foreign exchange.


In the debt crises of the 1980s, Latin countries imposed a blanket debt moratorium on all foreign currency borrowers, many of which were corporations and banks. In recent sovereign defaults (Ecuador, Pakistan, Russia, and Ukraine), corporate access to foreign currency was not restricted by the government, but there were few corporate foreign currency borrowers. Because every sovereign default is different, is difficult to predict how future distressed sovereigns will act.

With the exception of a few foreign-owned exporters, there remain strong arguments in support of the sovereign ceiling. Some argue that a particular international corporation, like a government-owned oil company, may be so vital to the country's access to foreign currency, that the corporation's credit reputation may supersede the country's ability to access international capital markets. However, while a nationally vital corporation may receive government assistance, it does not follow that its bondholders in general will prosper. Thus, one would expect most corporate issues to offer higher yields than their sovereign counterparts.

Although corporate debt has grown as a percentage of total emerging markets debt, most EMD corporate debt lacks the liquidity to facilitate active institutional investing. In many cases, market segmentation due to retail investing and liquidity constraints leads to relative prices of EMD corporate bonds versus sovereign bonds that are not justified, given the additional risks.

# Emerging Markets Debt Indices

The J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global (EMBI Global) is currently the most widely used benchmark by EMD investors (Exhibit 13.5). The EMBI Global consists of only U.S. dollar-denominated, sovereign bonds and does not use ratings as an inclusion criterion for issuers. The EMBI Global contains countries with investment-grade long-term foreign-currency ratings such as China, non-rated issuers such as Nigeria, and defaulted issuers such as Ivory Coast. As of December 31, 2000, there were 27 issuers in the EMBI Global.

In order for a country to be included in the EMBI Global it must meet either an income per capita criterion or a debt restructuring criterion. Countries that meet the income per capita criterion are classified in the lower or medium income per capita tier by the World Bank (income per capita less than 9,635). Countries that meet the debt restructuring criterion have restructured their external or local debt within the last 10 years. Popular emerging markets equity indices also use income per capita to classify countries for inclusion.

Once a country meets the criteria to be included in the EMBI Global, a particular bond must meet certain liquidity requirements. The liquidity requirements used by EMD indices are stringent in comparison to those used by other bond indices. In order to be included in the EMBI Global, a bond must have at least 500 million face amount outstanding, at least 2.5 years to maturity, verifiable prices, and verifiable cash flows.[5] The liquid nature of the EMBI Global Index facilitates the trading of index swaps and allows investors to quickly implement top-down strategy changes.

As of December 31, 2000, the market capitalization of the EMBI Global was 189 billion and had the following instrument composition: Brady bonds (38\%), Eurobonds (55\%), local issues (5\%), and loans (2\%).

Lack of diversification is the greatest concern voiced by investors regarding the EMD asset class in general and about EMD indices in particular. EMD indices have historically had high exposure to a small number of large individual issuers, such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico and to the Latin American region overall.

Index providers have responded to investor concerns by switching from ratings-based to GDP/capita-based country inclusion criteria (thus including higher-rated sovereigns) and by lowering liquidity requirements. From December 1995 to December 2000, the proportion of Latin

American issuers in J.P. Morgan's EMD indices fell from  $88\%$  to  $66\%$  and the number of issuers increased from 9 to 27.[6]

The EMBI Global has poor issuer diversification when compared to U.S. high-yield and U.S. investment-grade credit indices. While most U.S. high-yield and U.S. investment grade credit indices have hundreds of issuers, the EMBI Global only contains 27 sovereign issuers. Three issuers in the EMBI Global have a market weight in the index that is over  $10\%$ : Argentina  $(20\%)$ , Brazil  $(20\%)$ , and Mexico  $(15\%)$ . However, since an EMD portfolio is usually a small piece of an institutional investor's portfolio, issuer diversification should be less of a concern.

Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch calculate EMD indices that are broader than the EMBI Global; these indices are part of larger index mappings for global high-yield and U.S. bond plus strategies.[7] Lehman and Merrill indices include EMD corporates and non-dollar EMD securities. J.P. Morgan introduced a Euro-denominated EMD benchmark in May 2001; at inception, the index contained 15 countries and had a market cap of Euro 43.2 billion.

# ANALYTICS/MARKETCONVENTIONS

The myriad of bond types in the Brady market: fixed-rate, floating, step-up-to-fixed, step-up-to-floating coupons, together with different collateralization structures and amortization schedules make standard yield calculations and comparisons inapplicable. For example, comparing the yield on a collateralized bond of country A to the yield on an uncollateralized bond of country B does not provide information as to the yield on the risky sovereign cash flows, which is important to the investor. As a result, a number of conventions have been established by market participants in order to facilitate relative value comparisons among the different developing country bonds and between these bonds and other fixed income securities. Indeed, a new vocabulary has been created for the developing country debt market. The purpose of these analytical tools is to evaluate the sovereign portion of the bond independent of the collateral.

# Stripped Yield and Stripped Spread

Brady bonds are unique in that for a number (but not all) of these bonds, two (or more) semiannual coupon payments are collateralized with money market securities, while the principal payment at maturity is collateralized with U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds. A purchase of this type of Brady bond is effectively an investment in a combination of AA money market securities, a U.S. zero-coupon government bond, and a series of sovereign payments. Yield to maturity, if calculated in the standard way, is thus a weighted average of the riskless yields of the collateral and the risky yields of the sovereign payments. "Stripped yield" avoids this averaging by solving for the interest rate that the market applies solely to those cash flows which are sensitive to the sovereign credit risk. For example, on December 29, 2000, the Brazilian Par Brady bond had a yield to maturity of  $9.18\%$  and a stripped yield of  $14.65\%$ .

The correct analytical procedure is to value the collateral by discounting the collateral cash flows at the appropriate spot interest rate and to subtract this collateral value from the bond's market price; the remainder is the price of the sovereign cash flows. Given the sovereign cash flows and their derived price, the yield to maturity can then be calculated. In short, the bond is separated into collateral and sovereign components.

The term "stripped yield" is used because the collateral is stripped away from the Brady bond for analytical purposes, indicating the interest rate the market applies to the sovereign's credit. Stripped yield, sovereign yield, and sovereign stripped yield are interchangeable terms. The "stripped spread" is simply the stripped yield less the equivalent Treasury yield. Exhibit 13.6 illustrates the valuation process for a hypothetical Brady bond. Collateral cash flows are discounted at U.S. Treasury rates while sovereign cash flows are priced at Treasury rates plus a sovereign credit spread.

The coupon collateral is a contingent, or rolling, interest guarantee. If the sovereign borrower makes its coupon payment, the collateral remains in place and rolls forward to cover the next scheduled coupon payment. In the event of default, interest collateral would be paid to the bondholder in lieu of the sovereign's payments. Market participants disagree on the exact valuation methodology for the interest guarantee because of differing opinions on contingent valuations. Some use probability models to estimate the timing of the contingent guarantee, others assume that the immediate coupon payments are riskless, and yet others ignore the rolling interest guarantee altogether for yield calculations. Stripped spread comparisons of various Brady issues are only meaningful in the context of a particular model.

EXHIBIT 13.6 Brady Bonds Valuation — An Illustration

Note: Valuing the collateral by discounting the collateral cash flows at the approximate U.S. "spot" interest rate, allows the present value of the collateral (16) to be subtracted from the market price of the bond (47) to derive the present value of the sovereign cash flows (31). Given the timing of these sovereign cash flows, a yield to maturity on the stripped sovereign portion can then be calculated.

# Risk Measures

In addition to yield calculations, market participants have adapted traditional price sensitivity measures to the special features of Brady bonds. Interest rate duration estimates a bond's price responsiveness to changes in U.S. interest rates—all cash flows are revalued given changes in the U.S. yield curve. A bond is less sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates if the bond's coupons are floating (i.e., reset at a spread above Treasury yields). The investor is also concerned with isolating the bond's price response to a change in creditworthiness. Since only a portion of the bond's cash flows are exposed to sovereign credit risk (in some cases as little as  $50\%$ ), a change in stripped spread will result in the repricing of only a subset of the cash flows (the sovereign cash flows).

Thus, in addition to the standard interest rate duration measure, "spread duration" measures the bond's price responsiveness to movements in the stripped spread. If an overall widening of credit spreads is expected, the portfolio manager now has the tool to estimate which bonds will be more or less adversely affected. A Brady bond's spread duration is a function of the collateralization level, stripped yield level, and cash flow timing. Exhibit 13.7 compares spread and interest rate durations for various bonds in Brazil.

The high spread volatility of EMD bonds makes accurate risk measurement a necessity. Exhibit 13.8 compares the historical volatilities of various countries in the EMD Index. While the volatility of EMD Index stripped spread changes is approximately  $50\%$ , volatility of individual countries varies from  $35\%$  in South Africa to  $92\%$  in Russia. Exhibit 13.8 also shows that EMD spread volatility is much higher than the volatility of U.S. Treasury yields, so that most of the risk in an EMD portfolio comes from credit selection rather than U.S. yield curve exposure.

Since volatility of EMD bonds varies significantly from country to country, portfolio managers are using more advanced techniques to measure a portfolio's risk exposure. One technique is to adjust bond spread durations by a sensitivity measure that adjusts for volatility and correlation with the overall market.

# Attribution of Returns

As previously noted, sovereign bonds are issued in a myriad of formats (various combinations of floating/fixed rate and collateralized/uncollateralized). The characteristics of one country's bonds may differ greatly from another country's because of aforementioned differences in collateralization level, stripped yields, and maturity. In short, investors should be careful when comparing total returns across countries because of the significantly different bond formats. Because investors can manage or hedge general U.S. interest rate exposure outside of the sovereign market, a sovereign bond's total return can most usefully be separately attributed to U.S. interest rate exposure and to sovereign spread performance.

To illustrate these distinct effects, Exhibit 13.9 reviews December 2000 EMBI Global returns. The returns are divided into a U.S. Yield Factor and a Spread Factor. In December, U.S. interest rates declined by 35 basis points for 10-year bonds and 18 basis points for 30-year bonds. The impact of U.S. interest rate changes varied across countries. Bulgaria, which has predominantly floating-rate issues, had a slightly negative U.S. Yield Curve Factor, while the bulk of Chile's return came from the U.S. Yield Curve Factor (Chile has a fixed-rate 10-year bond in the Index).

Sovereign credit spread (incremental income) plus spread change effect (principal). Evolving assessments of creditworthiness had very differing return impacts as shown in the spread factor. Credit risk declined in Nigeria after the government reached a tentative agreement with the Paris Club to reschedule 23 billion dollars of principal and interest payments. Contrary to earlier speculation, private bondholders were not forced to restructure their claims. In contrast, Cote d'ivoire credit risk increased as the country continued to spiral towards political and economic collapse.


# SOVEREIGN CREDIT ANALYSIS

A country's bond spreads are related to its willingness and capacity to repay its debt. The latter depends directly on the amount of obligations coming due at a point in time and the foreign exchange resources and refinancing opportunities available at that time. Both economic and political factors should be considered when analyzing the resources available for a sovereign.

# Economic Considerations

Many economic measures are relevant to assessing the credit risk of a developing country. One manner of organizing economic and financial considerations is to compartmentalize measures into three categories: structural, solvency, and serviceability. In addition to making the analysis more manageable by removing redundancies, this categorization produces a term structure of credit risk, akin to the well-known notion of the term structure of interest rates. An understanding of individual country politics, as well as the role of various international agencies, is also an essential part of sovereign credit analysis.

# Structural

Measures belonging to this category describe the long-term fundamental health of the country. They include economic variables such as reliance on a particular commodity for export earnings, welfare indicators such as per capita GNP, and social/economic measures such as income distribution. These variables generally are not directly linked to default, but countries with poor structural fundamentals are likely to develop economic problems. Further, given two countries that are similar in other respects, the one with the inferior structural measures will have a lower capacity to tolerate adverse economic shocks.

# Solvency

In contrast to the structural variables, the solvency class contains intermediate term measures of a country's economic health. In particular, these variables should reflect the country's ability, over time, to meet its central government debt obligations. Both internal and external debt are included. Countries with inferior solvency measures, all else being equal, have higher default risk because international debt service competes with local economic constituencies for resources.

# Serviceability

The factors in this category are of short-term, if not immediate, concern. They reflect the country's foreign exchange reserve position relative to its obligations (and are therefore usually presented in ratio form). Some examples include: debt service (\% exports) and external debt (\% GDP). Despite good or improving fundamentals and strong solvency measures, a developing country may be forced into a crisis if its reserves are (or will become) deficient, or if alternative reserve sources, such as the International Monetary Fund, are circumscribed. Recent experience suggests that serviceability, or liquidity, is a paramount concern.[9]

# Political Considerations

Peculiar to analyzing developing country investments are certain critical political issues such as international aid and policy instability. The United States and multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and IMF have invested a great deal of political and financial capital in the recovery of developing countries and their return to the global marketplace. Therefore, an event which would ordinarily raise the likelihood of default may actually induce international organizations to assist the emerging country and reduce the probability of default. Alternatively, the movement to representative government and open markets is a recent phenomenon, and in many developing countries, there are few institutions in place to serve as anchors to these policies. The resignation or death of one key policy maker may be enough to alter economic policy. In sum, political factors can cut both ways: the politics of individual countries are often fragile, but international politics often have acted as counterbalances in the past.

In recent years, multilateral organizations have launched a debate and an initiative to make financial aid conditional on bondholder participation in providing financial relief to distressed sovereigns.[10] In 1999, Romania withstood an initiative from the IMF to default on its Eurobond payments and did not restructure its Eurobonds. At this stage, it is unclear if multilateral agencies are willing or able to influence a sovereign's relationship with its bondholders. However, it is likely that sovereign bondholders will take a more active roll in resolving financial crises in emerging markets.

While nascent representative governments may suffer from institutional instability, it is important to recognize that these countries have undergone profound political change in a short time. Most countries have moved from military rule to competitive, multiparty democracies within the decade. For example, in 1982, approximately  $80\%$  of the emerging market countries' populations were under communist or military rule; now approximately  $97\%$  are governed by democratic rule.


# Willingness to Pay

Some argue that sovereign risk analysis is doomed to failure because, notwithstanding the ability to pay, a country may be unwilling to make good on its debt obligations. Distinguishing sovereign risk from corporate or municipal credit risk on this basis alone exposes a deficient understanding of default risk. Borrowers default when their competing economic interests override the damage done by default. Default is never a casual decision. Issuers wait until they are completely destitute to make this decision. Corporations and municipalities are faced with the same decision as sovereign borrowers: at what point are you willing to capitulate and damage your reputation?

For example, in 1991, Columbia Gas Systems found the burden of high-priced, long-term gas supply contracts of the energy shortage era so damaging to its future that management declared bankruptcy and forced its suppliers to renegotiate the supply contracts to lower prices. Similarly, Orange County, California viewed the financial implications of their failed investment scheme so negatively that they too declared bankruptcy. Orange County taxpayers perceived little ownership of the problem because of the obscure nature of the investment scheme and its genitor. Most important, both borrowers were willing to default even though the debtors had substantial resources available to pay creditors and suppliers. The point is that economic strain creates a willingness issue for borrowers of all types.[11]

# Sovereign Credit Perspective

Exhibit 13.10 provides some perspective on the economic performance and financial measures of the primary EMD countries relative to developed countries. The figure compares statistics for the 10 largest emerging market debtors with G7 statistics. Developing countries' inflation performance is clearly inferior, but savings rates and central government debt measures compare favorably with those for industrialized countries and the Maastricht hurdles related to European Monetary Union. In particular, the average developing country central government debt/GDP ratio of  $50\%$  compares well to the  $80\%$  average debt/GDP ratio for the industrialized countries.

This juxtaposition highlights the fact that the major risk in emerging economies is often not the government's debt load on the economy, but access to foreign exchange. Because of previous poor policy management, weak banking systems, and ineffective leadership, many emerging countries are forced to borrow in foreign currency (usually U.S. dollars). Developing countries access foreign currency through foreign direct investment, exports, portfolio investment, and official loans, all of which depend upon sound economic management and stable political leadership. This access to dollars, which is a serviceability issue, can largely be a matter of investor confidence in policy makers and is a unique risk to this market. Total external debt (public and private foreign currency denominated debt) relative to GDP for emerging countries is not significantly different from that of developed countries, but, in some cases, these developing countries have difficulty accessing foreign currency through exports or through foreign direct investment.


This additional risk aside, three macro trends may lead investors to be optimistic that emerging countries will continue their economic development process and eventually become better credit risks. First, the retreat of communism and the Soviet State signal an end to dismal economic incentives for much of the world. Second, the movement to more democratic forms of government should, in the long run, stimulate a more competitive marketplace of ideas and policies. Lastly, the high rate of integration (trade, tourism, information technology, etc.) and the rapid pace of technological change make economic isolation more costly and less acceptable to the populace.

The current economic position of emerging countries is in some ways not radically different from their developed counterparts. What differentiates them is that emerging market borrowers have less institutional stability, less demonstrated commitment to free market principles, and less reliable access to foreign exchange. These problems lead primarily to a weaker serviceability measure, but do not necessarily imply structural infirmity or insolvency.

# PORTFOLIO CONSIDERATIONS

Since the beginning of 1991 when Brady bonds became viable assets for institutional investors, the EMD Index has outperformed the broad global and U.S. bond markets by a wide margin. Exhibit 13.11 displays EMD Index return premia (defined as total return less U.S. cash return) along with return premia for other market indices. Of course, given the nature of the risk inherent in these bonds and the immaturity of the market, volatility is also greater. The portfolio benefits of EMD are illustrated in Exhibit 13.12, which shows a simplified efficient frontier, including Emerging Debt Markets. The efficient frontier including Emerging Debt Markets has dominated the Developed Markets alternative since 1990. Other major indices are also plotted for comparative purposes.

# Correlations

An attractive feature of the emerging sovereign market is its low correlation to other asset classes, including other U.S. bond markets, as illustrated in Exhibit 13.13. Emerging market spreads also have no historic correlation with U.S. Treasury yields. Sometimes, EMD spreads have declined following a monetary easing in the U.S. Other times, investors shift from risk assets, such as EMD, to low risk assets causing Treasury yields and EMD spreads to move in opposite directions. Low correlation to other fixed income assets makes EMD an attractive addition to a diversified portfolio.

EXHIBIT 13.14 Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus Conditional Annualized Volatility (December 1990-December 2000)

# Return Volatility

Exhibit 13.14 provides a perspective on return premia volatility. The average annualized return volatility between December 1990 and December 2000 is  $15.6\%$ . The conditional annualized volatility, which measures short-term volatility, shows dramatic volatility spikes.[12] Returns are vola tile for two distinct reasons. First, the economic development process in these countries is inherently volatile. These countries are attempting to abandon long-ingraind social, economic, and political structures in a very short period of time. Second, return volatility often has less to do with the credit risk of the borrowers than the perspective of the investors. A casual observer of this market's return pattern might draw the conclusion that sovereign credit risk itself fluctuates wildly. A closer examination would reveal the scarcity of long-term investors, despite the inappropriateness of this sector for those with brief time horizons and high liquidity needs. As a result, much of the historical volatility was driven by liquidity considerations and speculation. Fundamentals did not change as rapidly as market price fluctuations would imply.


Events in the winter of 1994/1995 in the emerging debt market resembled the precipitous price declines in the U.S. high-yield bond market in 1989 and the mortgage market in 1994. In both cases, investors had taken on more risk than they understood or appreciated (corporate credit risk and interest rate option risk, respectively) and had enjoyed very good absolute returns for a significant period of time. Moreover, these securities were particularly ill-suited for their respective owners. In the case of high-yield bonds, the investment horizon of retail mutual fund investors was a poor match for this illiquid and volatile market. In the case of the mortgage market, portfolio managers of retail-oriented, short-term government bond funds (and others) were heavily invested in securities with extreme prepayment sensitivity. When interest rates began to rise, reversing a three-year trend, homeowner prepayments slowed abruptly. The value of many sensitive securities declined precipitously as prepayment assumptions were reassessed.

The emerging debt market mirrored these examples in two respects: (1) it produced uniformly stellar returns over a preceding 3-year period and (2) mutual fund managers placed billions of dollars of these securities in retail-oriented mutual funds that had liquidity and risk tolerances inconsistent with the nature of the securities. The panic liquidation of these investments after the Mexican peso devaluation caused tremendous illiquidity in the market, pushing prices down well below fundamental value.

EMD prices declined precipitously again in August 1998 during Russia's financial crisis. Once again, three prior years of uninterrupted, high returns had caused investors to become complacent regarding sovereign credit risk. In the Russian case, many leveraged foreign investors speculated in local currency Treasury Bills (GKOs) which went into default with an approximate  $90\%$  loss. The losses in the GKO market damaged the U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign debt market as leveraged investors liquidated their positions and other participants reassessed their assumptions.

Long-term investors such as mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies have gradually replaced banks, flight capital, and hedge funds as the primary holders of EMD bonds. As the investor base evolves, volatility due to liquidity panics should lessen.

# Expected Return

The long-term expected return on the sovereign, or risky, cash flows is a function of yield, default probability, and recovery value.

Default probability is crucial to expected returns, yet is a very difficult decision area. International bond defaults have occurred since the 1820s (including U.S. borrowers). Other major default episodes occurred in the 1870s, 1930s, and 1980s. Generally, past crises were due to poor use of loaned funds or worldwide economic depression or recession. Exhibit 13.15 reviews the circumstances of previous debt crises.

In this light, certain developments have improved the EMD credit environment. As more investment is being privately channeled, such as FDI, rather than publicly placed, borrowers are no longer wasting resources on armaments or huge white elephants. Currency and bond markets provide emerging market politicians with constant feedback about the appropriateness of their policies. Moreover, as the number of EMD issuers expands, the probability of simultaneous economic difficulties should diminish.


If investors are willing to expose their portfolios to implicit sovereign risk through multinational equity commitments, they would be well served to consider the pricing of explicit sovereign risk. If the optimistic economic assumptions girding the emerging markets earnings estimates of multinational corporations are reasonable, then implicit sovereign default expectations appear too high. In short, if equity investors prosper through international expansion into emerging economies, host country defaults are unlikely.

The restructuring of Russia's defaulted Soviet debt and Ecuador's Brady Bonds in 2000 suggest that EMD recovery rates may be higher than U.S. corporate recovery rates. Before restructuring, Russian and Ecuadorian bonds traded at 33 and 36, respectively. Prior to credit deterioration and subsequent default, these bonds traded at approximately 50. The exact recovery amount for these bonds is difficult to calculate because, being themselves the result of a former debt restructuring, they were not issued at par and traded immediately at deep discounts. But investors that bought these bonds in the secondary market prior to credit deterioration/default realized recovery values even higher than the historical corporate bond recovery rate (48\% of original face).

In the short run, the discount rates applied to bond cash flows will drive prices and returns; but in the long run, the cash flows themselves determine returns. Presuming that debt relief would be sufficient to resume debt repayments, cash flows can then be estimated by projecting the probability and timing of any future default/renegotiation. Holding the discount rate constant, a cash flow reduction roughly translates into a proportional return reduction. Thus, if a debtor immediately reduced its coupon payments on a 30-year obligation by  $40\%$  (and then made all future payments), the expected holding period return would decrease by approximately  $45\%$ . If the stated cash flows were priced to return  $14\%$ , the  $40\%$  coupon reduction would drop expected returns to approximately  $7.8\%$ . Each year that passes without a default significantly boosts returns; the expected return climbs to  $10.8\%$  if rescheduling does not occur until year seven.

Exhibit 13.16 examines return scenarios given varying recovery rates and varying pricing yields. (The pricing yield is simply the yield to maturity given the price of the cash flows.) The top graph illustrates that at the currently high pricing yields, holding period returns climb rapidly as default is avoided. Also, after ten years of payments, returns are relatively insensitive to recovery assumptions, due to high compounding rates. The bottom graph indicates that for a given principal recovery assumption of  $60\%$ , returns are more variable at higher pricing yields.

EXHIBIT 13.17 Conditional Default Probability versus Return Recovering Rate Assumption  $= 60\%$  (Varying Price Yield)

Another manner of assessing prospective returns is to consider the implied conditional probability of default (conditional upon no previous default and equally probable in any year). That is, given market pricing, recovery estimates, and required return, what is the implied annual probability of default? Exhibit 13.17 plots annual default probability (for three pricing scenarios) versus probability-weighted return, assuming a  $60\%$  recovery value. For example, if the sovereign cash flow is priced to yield  $14\%$ , the recovery assumption in the event of default is  $60\%$ , and the required return is  $10\%$ , then the implied annual conditional default probability is approximately  $15\%$ . Framed in this manner, the investor can judge the reasonableness of this default assumption in light of intermediate global economic trends and portfolio diversification effects.

In summary, sovereign default episodes are relatively rare and no easier to anticipate than large macroeconomic shifts. Pricing yields, recovery value assumptions, and default probabilities determine expected returns.

# Asset Allocation

Exhibit 13.18 highlights the equilibrium risk/reward position of emerging markets debt as a class relative to other financial markets (risk defined as beta: the asset class volatility relative to that of a globally diversified portfolio). The risk/reward position is much closer to traditional equity markets than other bond markets. The forward looking estimates of  $16\%$  annualized standard deviation of return premia and 0.46 correlation to the global market translate into an estimated beta of 1.12, given a  $6.6\%$  global market risk assumption. In light of these portfolio characteristics, limited performance history and judgments regarding liquidity and sovereign risks, risk premium in equilibrium is estimated at  $3.6\%$  per year (i.e. the incremental return over cash required by a globally diversified investor). Consequently, despite the high estimate of volatility, Emerging Markets Debt as an asset class provides an attractive portfolio risk/reward trade-off in equilibrium. One manner of framing this trade-off is the Treynor ratio, or risk premium relative to beta; from this viewpoint, Emerging Markets Debt compares favorably to other asset classes.


Exhibit 13.19 shows the differences in spreads between emerging market bonds and similarly rated U.S. corporates. As of December 2000, BBB- and BB-rated emerging market bonds had spreads that were 99 and 257 basis points higher than similarly rated U.S. corporate spreads, while B-rated emerging market bonds had spreads that were 13 basis points lower than B-rated U.S. corporate spreads. The spread difference between BBB-rated EMD and U.S. corporate bonds has historically shown little volatility. In contrast, the difference between EMD and corporate spreads for B-rated bonds has varied significantly.

Sources: Emerging Market Debt spread information from J.P.Morgan. U.S. corporate spread information from Merrill Lynch.

In December 2000, U.S. High-Yield (B- and BB- rated bonds) spreads were at relatively low levels compared to EMD spreads due to the recent difficulties in the technology and telecommunications sectors. At the end of 2000, Moody's U.S. high-yield default rate stood at  $5.6\%$  and was expected to increase to levels last seen in 1991.

# ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES

All U.S. dollar fixed-income sectors (mortgage, investment grade corporates, high yield, Eurobonds, and Brady bonds) are exposed to the risk that spreads over U.S. Treasury rates change. That is, despite a constant Treasury curve, incremental yield (spread) above this curve may increase or decrease for a number of reasons related to perceived risks in the sector. The change in spread impacts total returns just as a change in the underlying Treasury curve does.

Active management opportunities exist because spreads across countries are less than perfectly correlated and because bond structures vary within a country. Exhibit 13.20 shows the correlation of stripped spreads across countries. Each country's perceived creditworthiness does not move in lock-step with the overall market, as noted in the discussion of return attribution. This variation translates into active management opportunities as investors compare the price of sovereign credit risk (spread) versus their own assessment of that sovereign credit risk (value).

EXHIBIT 13.21 Brazil versus Argentina Stripped Spread Difference (through December 2000)

One example of inter-country spread volatility is illustrated in Exhibit 13.21. Even though Argentine and Brazilian spreads are highly correlated, they have provided several opportunities for active manage- ment strategies. During the Mexican crisis in 1994, Argentine banks suffered large withdrawals and spreads on Argentine bonds widened accordingly while Brazilian spreads were less affected. During the Brazilian devaluation in 1999, Brazilian spreads increased relative to Argentine spreads.


Opportunities also arise from instrument selection within a country. During times of market volatility, Brady bonds have historically traded at a large discount to Eurobonds. As discussed earlier in this chapter, some market participants argue that, under duress, countries may choose to service Eurobond obligations over Brady obligations just as they discriminated against the old bank loans.

If default risk and volatility distinctions do not warrant higher credit spreads on Brady issues, perhaps the sheer complexity of the Brady formats may explain the relative mispricing. Just as U.S. high-yield bond portfolio managers are often unfamiliar with sovereign credit analysis, others are equally uncomfortable with the unique analytical aspects of the Brady market. Exhibit 13.22 plots the sovereign (stripped) spread of an Argentine Brady bond versus the spread of a Republic of Argentina Eurobond. Despite having identical sovereign credit risk, the Brady bond traded at spreads 400 basis points over the Eurobond during the Russian crisis in 1998 and the Brazilian devaluation in early 1999.

EXHIBIT 13.23 Brazilian Bond Spreads, Brady Bond Comparison (Brazilian FLIRB versus Brazilian C-bond) (through December 2000)

Periods of high volatility cause spread curves to invert and exaggerate spread differences between benchmark securities and less liquid bonds. Exhibit 13.23 looks at the spread differences between two Brazilian Brady bonds: the FLIRB and the C-bond. During the Russian crisis (August 1998) and after Brazil devalued its currency (January 1999), the spread difference between the FLIRB and the C-bond got as high as 600 basis points due to both spread curve inversion and the relatively lower liquidity of the FLIRB.[13]

Emerging markets debt is an asset class with a smaller dedicated investor base than other asset classes. According to market estimates, the dedicated investors such as mutual funds and pension funds make up at most  $10\%$  to sovereign debt holders; crossover and local investors make up the remainder. In contrast, dedicated investors account for at least  $40\%$  of U.S. high-yield capitalization. Crossover investors make most of their investments in mature markets but will devote a small proportion of their investment funds to EMD.[14]

Since crossover investors are a large portion of EMD bond holders, their entry and exit into the market contributes to high emerging market volatility. Crossover preferences for certain types of bonds, particularly corporate bonds, create active management opportunities for the dedicated investor that can purchase corporates opportunistically at distressed levels.

# CONCLUSION

Emerging markets debt is an asset class with unique characteristics. Complex security structures, sovereign macroeconomic analysis and unique risk/return characteristics are particular to emerging markets debt.

Emerging markets debt is characterized by periods of high volatility where prices diverge from fundamentals. A lack of a dedicated investor base in EMD contributes to volatility and creates pricing anomalies between instruments. A fundamentally-based, active management style benefits from this volatility and inefficient pricing.

The following factors support the addition of emerging markets debt to a diversified portfolio:

■ With the resolution of the Latin debt crisis and the decline of communism, emerging market countries have shifted decisively towards capitalism and democracy.
Emerging markets debt has grown as an asset class. As of December 2000, it constituted approximately  $4.8\%$  of the World Bond Market.
Emerging markets debt has returned  $15.9\%$  annually in premia terms between December 1990 and December 2000.
Emerging markets debt has low correlation with other segments of the U.S. bond market.
