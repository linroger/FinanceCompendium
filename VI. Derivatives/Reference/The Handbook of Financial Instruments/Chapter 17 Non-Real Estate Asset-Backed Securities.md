Asset-backed securities are securities backed by loans or receivables. The securitization of residential mortgage loans is by far the largest type of asset that has been securitized and these securities are covered in Chapters 14 and 15. The collateral includes standard residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and manufactured housing loans. Securities backed by commercial mortgage loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), are covered in Chapter 16. For asset-backed securities not backed by real estate, the largest sector is securities backed by credit card receivables, covered in Chapter 18.

In this chapter, we discuss the basic features of asset-backed securities and the credit risks associated with investing in them. We then look at several types of asset-backed securities not backed by real estate or credit card receivables.

# FEATURES OF AN ABS

Before we discuss the major types of asset-backed securities, let's first look at the general features of the underlying collateral and the structure.

# Credit Enhancement

All asset-backed securities are credit enhanced. This means that support is provided for one or more of the bondholders in the structure. Credit enhancement levels are determined relative to a target rating desired by the issuer for a security by each rating agency. There are two general types of credit enhancement structures: external and internal. We describe each type in Chapter 15.

# Amortizing versus Nonamortizing Assets

The collateral for an ABS can be classified as either amortizing or non-amortizing assets. Amortizing assets are loans in which the borrower's periodic payment consists of scheduled principal and interest payments over the life of the loan. The schedule for the repayment of the principal is called an amortization schedule. The standard residential mortgage loan falls into this category. Auto loans and closed-end home equity loans are amortizing assets. Any excess payment over the scheduled principal payment is called a prepayment.

In contrast to amortizing assets, nonamortizing assets do not have a schedule for the periodic payments that the individual borrower must make. Instead, a nonamortizing asset is one in which the borrower must make a minimum periodic payment. If that payment is less than the interest on the outstanding loan balance, the shortfall is added to the outstanding loan balance. If the periodic payment is greater than the interest on the outstanding loan balance, then the difference is applied to the reduction of the outstanding loan balance. There is no schedule of principal payments (i.e., no amortization schedule) for a nonamortizing asset. Consequently, the concept of a prepayment does not apply. Credit card receivables and open-end home equity loans are examples of nonamortizing assets.

For an amortizing asset, projection of the cash flows requires projecting prepayments. One factor that may affect prepayments is the prevailing level of interest rates relative to the interest rate on the loan. In projecting prepayments it is critical to determine the extent to which borrowers take advantage of a decline in interest rates below the loan rate in order to refinance the loan.

As with nonagency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) which are described in Chapter 15, modeling defaults for the collateral is critical in estimating the cash flows of an asset-backed security. Proceeds that are recovered in the event of a default of a loan prior to the scheduled principal repayment date of an amortizing asset represents a prepayment and are referred to as an involuntary prepayment. Projecting prepayments for amortizing assets requires an assumption of the default rate and the recovery rate. For a nonamortizing asset, while the concept of a prepayment does not exist, a projection of defaults is still necessary to project how much will be recovered and when.


The analysis of prepayments can be performed on a pool level or a loan level. In pool-level analysis it is assumed that all loans comprising the collateral are identical. For an amortizing asset, the amortization schedule is based on the gross weighted average coupon (GWAC) and weighted average maturity (WAM) for that single loan. Pool-level analysis is appropriate where the underlying loans are homogeneous. Loan-level analysis involves amortizing each loan (or group of homogeneous loans).

The maturity of an asset-backed security is not a meaningful parameter. Instead, the average life of the security is calculated. This measure is introduced in Chapter 14.

# Fixed-Rate versus Floating-Rate

There are fixed-rate and floating-rate asset-backed securities. Floating-rate asset-backed securities are typically created where the underlying pool of loans or receivables pay a floating rate. The most common are securities backed by credit card receivables, home equity line of credit receivables, closed-end home equity loans with an adjustable rate, student loans, Small Business Administration loans, and trade receivables. With the use of derivative instruments, fixed-rate collateral also can be used to create a structure that has one or more floating-rate tranches. For example, there are automobile loan-backed securities with a fixed rate that can be pooled to create a structure with floating-rate tranches.

# Passthrough versus Paythrough Structures

How a mortgage passthrough security is created is explained in Chapter 14. A pool of mortgage loans is used as collateral and certificates (securities) are issued with each certificate entitled to a pro rata share of the cash flow from the pool of mortgage loans. So, if a 100 million mortgage pool is the collateral for a passthrough security and 10,000 certificates are issued, then the holder of one certificate is entitled to 1/10,000 of the cash flow from the collateral.

The same type of structure, a passthrough structure, can be used for an asset-backed security deal. That is, each certificate holder is entitled to a pro rata share of the cash flow from the underlying pool of loans or receivables. For example, consider the following asset-backed security structure: senior tranche


280 million

10,000 certificates issued subordinated tranche


20 million

1,000 certificates issued

Each certificate holder of the senior tranche is entitled to receive 1/10,000 of the cash flow to be paid to the senior tranche from the collateral. Each certificate holder of the subordinated tranche is entitled to receive 1/1,000 of the cash flow to be paid to the subordinated tranche from the collateral.

How a passthrough security can be used to create a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) is also explained in Chapter 14. That is, passthrough securities are pooled and used as collateral for a CMO. Another name for a CMO structure is a paythrough structure. In the case of an ABS, the loans are either pooled and issued as a passthrough security or as a paythrough security. That is, unlike in the agency mortgage-backed securities market, a passthrough is not created first and then the passthrough is used to create a paythrough security. This is the same process as with a nonagency mortgage-backed security.

In a paythrough structure, the senior tranches can be simple sequentialpays, as described for CMOs in Chapter 14. Or, there could be a planned amortization class (PAC) structure with, say, senior tranche 1 being a short average life PAC, senior tranche 2 being a long average life tranche, and the other two senior tranches being support tranches.

It is important to emphasize that the senior-subordinated structure is a mechanism for redistributing credit risk from the senior tranche to the subordinated tranches and is referred to as credit tranching. When the senior tranche is carved up into tranches with different exposures to prepayment risk in a paythrough structure, prepayment risk can be transferred among the senior tranches as in a nonagency CMO. This is referred to as prepayment tranching or time tranching.

# Optional Clean-Up Call Provisions

For asset-backed securities there is an optional clean-up call provision granted to the issuer. There are several types of clean-up call provisions.

In a percent of collateral call, the outstanding bonds can be called at par value if the outstanding collateral's balance falls below a predetermined percent of the original collateral's balance. This is the most common type of clean-up call provision for amortizing assets, and the predetermined level is typically  $10\%$ .

A percent of bonds clean-up call provision is similar to a percent of collateral call except that the percent that triggers the call is the percent of the amount of the bonds outstanding relative to the original amount of bonds issued. In structures where there is more than one type of collateral, such as in home equity loan-backed securities, a percent of tranche clean-up call provision is used.

A call on or after specified date operates just like a standard call provision for corporate, agency, and municipal securities. In a latter of percent or date call the outstanding bonds can be called if either (1) the collateral outstanding reaches a predetermined level before the specified call date or (2) the call date has been reached even if the collateral outstanding is above the predetermined level.

In an auction call, common in certain types of home equity loan-backed securities, at a certain date a call will be exercised if an auction results in the outstanding collateral being sold at a price greater than its par value. The premium over par value received from the auctioned collateral is retained by the trustee and eventually paid to the issuer through the residual.

In addition to the above clean-up call provisions, which permit the trustee to call the bonds, there may be an insurer call. Such a call permits the insurer to call the bonds if the collateral's cumulative loss history reaches a predetermined level.

# CREDIT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING IN ABS

In evaluating credit risk, the rating agencies focus on four areas:

■ asset risks
■ structural risks legal and regulatory considerations
third parties to the structure

We discuss each area below.

# Asset Risks

Evaluating asset risks involves the analysis of the credit quality of the collateral. The rating agencies will look at the underlying borrower's ability to pay and the borrower's equity in the asset. The latter will be a key determinant as to whether the underlying borrower will default or sell the asset and pay off a loan. The rating agencies will look at the experience of the originators of the underlying loans and will assess whether the loans underlying a specific transaction have the same characteristics as the experience reported by the issuer.

The concentration of loans is examined. The underlying principle of asset securitization is that a large number of borrowers in a pool will reduce the credit risk via diversification. If there are a few borrowers in the pool that are significant in size relative to the entire pool balance, this diversification benefit can be lost, resulting in a higher level of default risk. This risk is called concentration risk. In such instances, rating agencies will set concentration limits on the amount or percentage of receivables from any one borrower. If the concentration limit at issuance is exceeded, the issue will receive a lower credit rating than if the concentration limit was not exceeded. If after issuance the concentration limit is exceeded, the issue may be downgraded.


The rating agencies will use statistical analysis to assess the most likely loss to an investor in an ABS tranche due to the performance of the collateral. The rating agencies will analyze various scenarios, and from the results of these scenarios they can determine an expected (or weight average) loss for the investor in a tranche and the variability of the loss.

# Structural Risks

As explained earlier in this chapter, the payment structure of an asset-backed deal can be either a passthrough or paythrough structure. The former simply has one senior tranche and the cash flow is distributed on a pro rata basis to the bondholders. In a paythrough structure, the senior tranche is divided into more than one tranche and there are payment rules as to how the cash flows from the collateral are to be distributed amongst the senior tranches.

The decision as to whether a passthrough or paythrough structure is used is made by the issuer. Once selected, the rating agencies examine the extent to which the cash flow from the collateral can satisfy all of the obligations of the ABS deal. The cash flow of the underlying collateral is interest and principal repayment. The cash flow payments that must be made are interest and principal to investors, servicing fees, and any other expenses for which the issuer is liable. The rating companies analyze the structure to test whether the collateral's cash flows match the payments that must be made to satisfy the issuer's obligations. This requires that the rating agency make assumptions about losses and delinquencies and consider various interest rate scenarios after taking into consideration credit enhancements.

In considering the structure, the rating agencies will consider (1) the loss allocation (how losses will be allocated to the tranches in the structure), (2) the cash flow allocation (i.e., in a paythrough structure the priority rules for the distribution of principal and interest), (3) the interest rate spread between the interest earned on the collateral and the interest paid to the tranches plus the servicing fee, (4) the potential for a trigger event to occur that will cause the rapid amortization of a deal, and (5) how credit enhancement may change over time.

# Legal Structure

A corporation issuing an ABS seeks a rating on the securities it issues that is higher than its own corporate rating. This is done by using the underlying loans as collateral for a debt instrument rather than the general credit of the issuer. Typically, however, the corporate entity (i.e., seller of the collateral) retains some interest in the collateral. For example, the corporate entity can retain a subordinated tranche. Because the corporate entity retains an interest, rating companies want to be assured that a bankruptcy of that corporate entity will not allow the issuer's creditors access to the collateral. That is, there is concern that a bankruptcy court could redirect the collateral's cash flows or the collateral itself from the security holders in an ABS transaction to the creditors of the corporate entity if it became bankrupt.

To solve this problem, a bankruptcy-remote special-purpose vehicle (SPV) is formed. The issuer of the asset-backed security is then the SPV. Legal opinion is needed stating that in the event of bankruptcy of the seller of the collateral, counsel does not believe that a bankruptcy court will consolidate the collateral sold with the assets of the seller.

The SPV is set up as a wholly owned subsidiary of the seller of the collateral. Although it is a wholly owned subsidiary, it is established in such a way that it is treated as a third-party entity relative to the seller of the collateral. The collateral is sold to the SPV, which, in turn, resells the collateral to the trust. The trust holds the collateral on behalf of the investors. The SPV holds the interest retained by the seller of the collateral.

# Third-Party Providers

In an ABS deal there are several third parties involved. These include third-party credit enhancers, the servicer, a trustee, issuer's counsel, a guaranteed investment contract provider (this entity insures the reinvestment rate on investable funds), and accountants. The rating agency will investigate all third-party providers. For the thirty-party enhancers, the rating agencies will perform a credit analysis of their ability to pay.

All loans must be serviced. Servicing involves collecting payments from borrowers, notifying borrowers who may be delinquent, and, when necessary, recovering and disposing of the collateral if the borrower does not make loan repayments by a specified time. These responsibilities are fulfilled by a third party to an ABS transaction, the servicer. Moreover, while still viewed as a "third party" in many asset-backed securities transactions, the servicer is likely to be the originator of the loans used as the collateral.

In addition to the administration of the loan portfolio as just described, the servicer is responsible for distributing the proceeds collected from the borrowers to the different bondholders in an ABS trans- action according to the payment priorities. Where there are floating-rate securities in the transaction, the servicer will determine the interest rate for the period. The servicer may also be responsible for advancing payments when there are delinquencies in payments (that are likely to be collected in the future), resulting in a temporary shortfall in the payments that must be made to the bondholders.


The role of the servicer is critical in an ABS transaction. Therefore, rating agencies look at the ability of a servicer to perform all the activities that a servicer will be responsible for before they assign a rating to the bonds in a transaction. For example, the following factors are reviewed when evaluating servicers: servicing history, experience, underwriting standard for loan originations, servicing capabilities, human resources, financial condition, and growth/competition/business environment. Based on its analysis, a rating agency determines whether the servicer is acceptable or unacceptable. Transactions including the latter are not rated, or the rating agency may require a backup servicer if there is a concern about the ability of a servicer to perform.

Remember that the issuer is not a corporation with employees. It simply has loans and receivables. The servicer therefore plays an important role in ensuring that the payments are made to the bondholders.

# REVIEW OF SEVERAL NON-REAL ESTATE ABS

The list of non-real estate assets that have been securitized continues to grow. Below we restrict our discussion to a few asset types that have been securitized—auto loan-backed securities, student-loan backed securities, SBA-loan backed securities, aircraft ABS, franchise-loan backed securities, and rate reduction bonds.

# Auto Loan-Backed Securities

Auto loan-backed securities represent one of the oldest and most familiar sectors of the ABS market. A key factor in the appeal of auto ABS securities is the historically strong credit quality of the underlying collateral. Of the most active sectors in the ABS arena—autos, credit cards, home equity loans (HELs)—autos are generally considered to have the strongest credit quality (that is, before credit enhancement brings virtually all senior securities across sectors to a triple-A rating).

Auto ABS are issued by:

1. the financial subsidiaries of auto manufacturers (domestic and foreign)
2. commercial banks

3. independent finance companies and small financial institutions specializing in auto loans

The auto loan market has traditionally played a major role in the ABS universe, representing about  $16\%$  of the outstanding ABS market. Since 1999 there has been explosive growth in this sector attributed largely to the "prime market"—specifically, to loans originated by the Big Three auto company part of that market. Other parts of the prime auto loan sector also had strong increases, with Japanese captive finance companies leading the way.

Prime auto loans are of fundamentally high credit quality for the following reasons. First, they are a secured form of lending (credit cards are unsecured lending). Second, they begin to repay principal immediately through amortization (credit cards require only a minimum payment). Third, they are short-term in nature (HELs have 15-30 year maturities). Finally, for the most part, major issuers of auto loans have tended to follow reasonably prudent underwriting standards.

Unlike the sub-prime mortgage industry, there is less consistency on what actually constitutes various categories of prime and sub-prime auto loans. According to Moody's, the prime market is composed of issuers typically having cumulative losses (on a static pool basis) of less than  $3\%$ ; near-prime issuers that have cumulative losses of  $3 - 7\%$ ; and sub-prime issuers with losses exceeding  $7\%$ .

# Cash Flows and Prepayments

The cash flow for auto loan-backed securities consists of regularly scheduled monthly loan payments (interest and scheduled principal repayments) and any prepayments. For securities backed by auto loans, prepayments result from

■ sales and trade-ins requiring full payoff of the loan
■ repossession and subsequent resale of the automobile
■ loss or destruction of the vehicle
■ payoff of the loan with cash to save on the interest cost
■ refinancing of the loan at a lower interest cost

While refinancings may be a major reason for prepayments of mortgage loans, they are of minor importance for automobile loans. Moreover, the interest rates for automobile loans underlying some deals are substantially below market rates since they are offered by manufacturers as part of a sales promotion.

Prepayments for auto loan-backed securities are measured in terms of the absolute prepayment speed (ABS). The ABS measure is the monthly prepayment expressed as a percentage of the original collateral amount. As explained in Chapter 14, the single monthly mortality rate (SMM) is a monthly conditional prepayment rate (CPR) that expresses prepayments based on the prior month's balance.

# Structures

There are auto loan-backed deals that are passthrough structures and paythrough structures. In the typical passthrough structure there is a senior tranche and a subordinate tranche. There is also an interest-only class. While more deals are structured as passthroughs, this structure is typically used for smaller deals. Larger deals usually have a paythrough structure.

Since inception of the grantor trust passthrough in the mid-1980s through late-1999, only a few innovations have been introduced into this sector. These included an owner's trust structure (which permitted branching), the securitization of non-prime loans, and the use of auto leases as collateral. Other than those few developments, the sector was, for the most part, relatively boring and predictable. Investors came to appreciate that this area was dominated by the "Big Three" auto makers, offered low credit losses, and represented a safe, liquid part of the short end of the ABS maturity spectrum.

However, several interesting developments in 2000 and 2001 made the auto sector somewhat less steady. First was the introduction of a soft bullet in late-1999, a structure that had been the norm in credit cards for many years. Second was the shift towards greater floating-rate issuance, a sharp contrast to the long-term convention of fixed-rate auto ABS. The final change was use of an initial revolving period, which extends the average life of the securities.

Although none of these structural changes are revolutionary, on balance they represent a major change in the auto sector. This is important, because the greater diversity of security types has attracted a wider range of investors. Below we examine these relatively new features.

Soft Bullets Perhaps the most interesting innovation was the introduction of the soft bullet structure. Since the inception of auto ABS in the mid-1980s, auto ABS have been structured with amortizing principal payments. This cash flow structure of the security mirrors the underlying payments on the collateral, which typically are 4- to 5-year amortizing loans. Although the owner trust structure allowed for prioritization of cash flows across different classes, the amortization of principal had not been dealt with until 2001.

The Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust (CARAT) 1999-2 issue by GMAC in August 1999 marked the first time that investors were able to buy auto loan ABS with a soft bullet maturity. Exhibit 17.1 presents the details of the different classes from that deal. This structure was able to offer soft bullet classes instead of amortizing classes, because it included a new type of security that could (1) absorb the amortizing principal cash flows prior to the bullet date and (2) provide the cash flow to meet the bullet principal payment at maturity.

In the CARAT structure, this security was christened a "variable pay term note" (VPTN). At origination, the deal contained a VPTN-1 class that received all principal payments until class A-1 targeted final maturity date, at which point the VPTN-1 class would be paid down. At that point the trust would issue a new VPTN-2 class, the proceeds from which would be used to pay down the A1 class. During the next period, principal payments would go to pay down the VPTN-2 class. On the maturity date of the A2 class, a new class, VPTN-3, would be issued; the proceeds would pay off the A2 bullet class. This process of creating new variable notes and paying them down continues until all the bullet securities are paid off.

Beginning with the CARAT 2000-2 deal, GMAC modified its soft bullet structure by using a single variable pay note rather than a series of notes. At the maturity date of each bullet class, the VTPN in this revised structure is increased by the amount needed to pay off the bullet class. Then the enlarged variable pay note is paid down until the next bullet maturity date.

Ford's soft bullet deals utilized a structure similar to that in the early CARAT deals. The first such Ford deal, Ford 2000-B, was issued in April 2000.

Since the initial CARAT soft bullet deal, the use of the soft bullet structure has been irregular. So far, only GMAC (via CARAT deals) and Ford have used the structure. Ford used it on three deals in 2000: Ford Credit Auto Owner Trusts 2000-B, 2000-D, and 2000-F. Ford has not revisited the soft bullet structure as of this writing. On the other hand, GMAC has used it exclusively since the initial CARAT 1999-2.

Floating-Rate Autos The second major change in the auto sector was the increased issuance of floaters. In response to the volatile environment for corporates in 2001 and early 2002, the auto ABS market experienced a dramatic increase in floater issuance. Until that time, auto loans were almost exclusively a fixed-rate product. Floating-rate issuance in 2000 accounted for only  $4.3\%$  of total auto ABS issuance. In the first half of 2001, however, that percentage shot up to  $25.5\%$ .

An example of a floating-rate auto loan ABS is the Toyota Motor Credit of May 2001 (Toyota Auto Receivables 2001-B Owner Trust), the first auto deal entirely comprised of floating-rate tranches. This \$1.5 billion issue was divided into four tranches, three of which were sold publicly. The fourth tranche, a \$418 million money-market class, was placed privately. Details of this issue are presented in Exhibit 17.2.

Revolving Period Another recent innovation, introduced in the Ford 2000-F deal, is an initial revolving period during which the securities receive no principal payments. Instead, during this time, collateral payments are used to purchase additional receivables. After the revolving period ends, the securities pay down in sequential order. The revolving period in this deal added 1.5 years to the average life of each class. We can see this in Exhibit 17.3, which compares average lives of Ford 2000-F tranches with those from Ford 2000-D, a deal typical of other Ford soft bullet deals. The advantage to investors is that they can purchase an auto ABS with a longer average life than found in other auto deals. However to our knowledge, this is the only public auto deal using this technique, which suggests that demand for this structure was not great enough to encourage a follow-up deal.[2]


# Student Loan-Backed Securities

Student loans are made to cover college cost (undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs such as medical school and law school) and tuition for a wide range of vocational and trade schools. Securities backed by student loans are popularly referred to as SLABS (student loan asset-backed securities).

The student loans that have been most commonly securitized are those that are made under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). Under this program, the government makes loans to students via private lenders. The decision by private lenders to extend a loan to a student is not based on the applicant's ability to repay the loan. If a default of a loan occurs and the loan has been properly serviced, then the government will guarantee up to  $98\%$  of the principal plus accrued interest.

Loans that are not part of a government guarantee program are called alternative loans. These loans are basically consumer loans, and the lender's decision to extend an alternative loan will be based on the ability of the applicant to repay the loan. Alternative loans have been securitized.

Congress created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to provide liquidity in the mortgage market by allowing these government-sponsored enterprises to buy mortgage loans in the secondary market. Congress created the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) as a government-sponsored enterprise to purchase student loans in the secondary market and to securitize pools of student loans. Sallie Mae is the major issuer of SLABS, and its issues are viewed as the benchmark issues. Other entities that issue SLABS are either traditional corporate entities (e.g., the Money Store and PNC Bank) or nonprofit organizations (Michigan Higher Education Loan Authority and the California Educational Facilities Authority). The SLABS of the latter typically are issued as tax-exempt securities and therefore trade in the municipal market.

# Collateral

There are different types of student loans under the FFELP, including subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans, Parental Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS), and Supplemental Loans to Students (SLS). These loans involve three periods with respect to the borrower's payments—deferment period, grace period, and loan repayment period. Typically, student loans work as follows. While a student is in school, no payments are made by the student on the loan. This is the deferment period. Upon leaving school, the student is extended a grace period of usually 6 months when no payments on the loan must be made. After this period, payments are made on the loan by the borrower.

Prepayments typically occur due to defaults or loan consolidation. Even if there is no loss of principal faced by the investor when defaults occur, the investor is still exposed to contraction risk. This is the risk that the investor must reinvest the proceeds at a lower spread and, in the case of a bond purchased at a premium, the premium will be lost. Studies have shown student loan prepayments are insensitive to the level of interest rates. Consolidation of a loan occurs when the student who has loans over several years combines them into a single loan. The proceeds from the consolidation are distributed to the original lender and, in turn, distributed to the bondholders.

# Structures

Structures on student loan floaters have experienced more than the usual amount of change since 2000. The reason for this is quite simple. The underlying collateral—student loans—is exclusively indexed to 3-month Treasury bills, while a large percentage of securities are issued as LIBOR floaters. This creates an inherent mismatch between the collateral and the securities.

EXHIBIT 17.4 Alternative Structures for Student Loan ABS

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Collateral Index</td><td colspan="2">Internal to the Deal From 3rd Party</td><td rowspan="2">Security Issued</td></tr><tr><td>Swap</td><td>Cap</td></tr><tr><td>3-mo. T-Bill</td><td>no</td><td>no</td><td>T-Bill/student loan rate cap</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>no</td><td>no</td><td>3-mo. LIBOR/student loan rate cap</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>no</td><td>yes</td><td>3-mo. LIBOR/capless</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3-mo. T-Bill/3-mo. LIBOR</td><td>no</td><td>3-mo. LIBOR/capless</td></tr></table>

Issuers have dealt with the mismatch in a variety of ways. Some issued Treasury bill floaters which eliminate the mismatch, others issued hedged or unhedged LIBOR floaters, while others switched back and forth between the two. Recently, some have issued both Treasury and LIBOR floaters in the same transaction.

Exhibit 17.4 lists the main structural permutations from which issuers can chose. They can issue securities linked to Treasury bills. If they chose this route, there is minimal mismatch risk because the coupon on the bonds will rise and fall in line with the index on the collateral. Such floaters are essentially capless, although typically they do contain a "student loan rate" cap for liquidity management purposes.

Investors who prefer LIBOR-indexed assets, and who want to invest in student loan floaters from such an issuer, are forced to enter into an interest rate swap outside the deal. The other issuance selection is to issue LIBOR floaters. When no cap protection is provided, the bonds have an available funds cap (i.e., a student loan rate cap). This cap is generally defined as the monthly or quarterly cash flow from the student loan rate, less servicing and administration fees. The student loan rate is a weighted average of the various types of loans in a particular deal plus the rates on the special allowance supplement (SAP) payments.

If LIBOR spiked relative to the 3-month Treasury bill rate, or if bills dropped in a flight to quality, it is possible there would be insufficient funds available to meet bond interest payments. In such structures, it is typical to have a make-up or carryover provision. Once the index on the collateral rises (or the coupon on the bonds falls) sufficiently, the increased cash flow is used to make up the interest carryover amount. While it is conceivable that the spread between Treasuries and LIBOR could widen and stay permanently at a level that the shortfall might never be recouped, this is a highly unlikely event based on historical experience.


It is important to bear in mind that when an ABS structure contains a basis mismatch, it is not only the investor, but the issuer that bears a risk. Student loan deals (like deals in many other ABS classes) have excess spread, i.e., roughly the difference between the net coupon on the collateral and the coupon on the bonds.

In mortgage-related ABS, the excess spread is much larger than in the student loan sector, and is used to absorb monthly losses. Since losses in federally guaranteed student loans are relatively small, the vast majority of the excess spread flows back to the issuer. Hence, the Treasury bill/LIBOR basis risk is of major concern to issuers. When an issuer incorporates a swap in the deal, it not only reduces the risk to the investor (by eliminating the effect of an available funds cap) but reduces risk to the issuer, as well, by protecting a level of excess spread. When a cap is purchased, it is primarily for the benefit of the investor, because the cap only comes into play once the excess spread in the deal has been effectively reduced to zero.

The indices used on private and public student loan ABS transactions since the earliest deals in 1993 have shifted over time (even though throughout this period, the index on the underlying loans was always 3-month Treasury bills). During 1993-1995, most issuers, with the notable exception of Sallie Mae, used 1-month LIBOR, which indicated strong investor preference for LIBOR floaters. By contrast, from Sallie Mae's first deal in late 1995-on, that issuer chose to issue Treasury bill floaters to minimize interest rate risk.

In 1999, Congress changed the formula for the special allowance supplement (SAP) paid to banks that originate student loans. Student loan rates are capped. If interest rates increase to a point where the student loan rate is capped out, the Education Department supplements the students' payments to the lending bank. Traditionally, these SAP payments, like the student loan rate, were indexed to the 3-month Treasury-bill rate. Under the new formula, SAP payments on newly originated loans are indexed to 3-month commercial paper. Since SAP payments can represent a sizeable amount of the cash flow in a student loan deal, and commercial paper is highly correlated to LIBOR, this change reduces the "natural" mismatch between student loan collateral and student loan ABS.

# SBA Loan-Backed Securities

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is an agency of the U.S. government empowered to guarantee loans made by approved SBA lenders to qualified borrowers. The loans are backed by the full faith and credit of the

U.S. government. Most SBA loans are variable-rate loans where the reference rate is the prime rate. The rate on the loan is reset monthly on the first of the month or quarterly on the first of January, April, July, and October. SBA regulations specify the maximum coupon allowable in the secondary market. Newly originated loans have maturities between 5 and 25 years.

The Small Business Secondary Market Improvement Act passed in 1984 permitted the pooling of SBA loans. When pooled, the underlying loans must have similar terms and features. The maturities typically used for pooling loans are 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years. Loans without caps are not pooled with loans that have caps.

Most variable-rate SBA loans make monthly payments consisting of interest and principal repayment. The amount of the monthly payment for an individual loan is determined as follows. Given the coupon formula of the prime rate plus the loan's quoted margin, the interest rate is determined for each loan. Given the interest rate, a level payment amortization schedule is determined. This level payment is paid until the coupon rate is reset.

The monthly cash flow that the investor in an SBA-backed security receives consists of: the coupon interest based on the coupon rate set for the period

the scheduled principal repayment (i.e., scheduled amortization) prepayments

Prepayments for SBA-backed securities are measured in terms of CPR. Voluntary prepayments can be made by the borrower without any penalty. There are several factors contributing to the prepayment speed of a pool of SBA loans. A factor affecting prepayments is the maturity date of the loan. It has been found that the fastest speeds on SBA loans and pools occur for shorter maturities. The purpose of the loan also affects prepayments. There are loans for working capital purposes and loans to finance real estate construction or acquisition. It has been observed that SBA pools with maturities of 10 years or less made for working capital purposes tend to prepay at the fastest speed. In contrast, loans backed by real estate that are long maturities tend to prepay at a slow speed. All other factors constant, pools that have capped loans tend to prepay more slowly than pools of uncapped loans.

# Aircraft ABS

Aircraft financing has gone through an evolution over the past several years. It started with mainly bank financing, then moved to equipment trust certificates (ETCs), then to enhanced ETCs (EETCs), and finally to aircraft ABS. Today, both EETCs and aircraft ABS are widely used.

EETCs are corporate bonds that share some of the features of structured products, such as credit tranching and liquidity facilities. Aircraft ABS differ from EETCs in that they are not corporate bonds, and they are backed by leases to a number of airlines instead being tied to a single airline. The rating of aircraft ABS is based on the cash flow from the pool of aircraft leases or loans and the collateral value of that aircraft, not on the rating of lessee airlines.

One of the major characteristics that set aircraft ABS apart from other forms of aircraft financing is their diversification. ETCs and EETCs finance aircraft from a single airline. An aircraft ABS is usually backed by leases from a number of different airlines, located in a number of different countries and flying a variety of aircraft types. This diversification is a major attraction for investors. In essence, they are investing in a portfolio of airlines and aircraft types rather than a single airline—as in the case of an airline corporate bond. Diversification also is one of the main criteria that rating agencies look for in an aircraft securitization. The greater the diversification, the higher the credit rating, all else being equal.

# Aircraft Leasing

Although there are various forms of financing that might appear in an aircraft ABS deal—including operating leases, financing leases, loans, or mortgages—to date, the vast majority of the collateral in aircraft deals has been operating leases. In fact, all of the largest deals have been issued by aircraft leasing companies. This does not mean that a diversified finance company or an airline itself might not at some point bring a lease-backed or other aircraft ABS deal. It just means that so far, aircraft ABS have been mainly the province of leasing companies. Airlines, on the other hand, are active issuers of EETCs.

Aircraft leasing differs from general equipment leasing in that the useful life of an aircraft is much longer than most pieces of industrial or commercial equipment. In a typical equipment lease deal, cash flow from a particular lease on a particular piece of equipment only contributes to the ABS deal for the life of the lease. There is no assumption that the lease will be renewed. In aircraft leasing, the equipment usually has an original useful life of  $20+$  years, but leases run for only around 4-5 years. This means that the aircraft will have to be re-leased on expiration of the original leases. Hence, in the rating agencies' review, there's a great deal of focus on the risks associated with re-leasing the aircraft.

The risk of being able to put the plane back out on an attractive lease can be broken down into three components: (1) the time it takes to release the craft, (2) the lease rate, and (3) the lease term. Factors that can affect re-leasing include:

■ General health of the economy —Although there is a long-term, secular rise in both passenger and freight miles flown, the airline industry is well known for its sharp cyclical swings, and it typically experiences sharp declines during recessions.
■ Health of the airline industry —Periods of overbuilding (which there have been) can create sharp declines in aircraft values and lease rates.
- Obsolescence — Older aircraft run the risk of becoming technically (or legislatively) obsolete. The older the aircraft, in general, the more difficult it is to obtain high lease rates on renewal.
Type of aircraft—Today, wide-body aircraft are less in demand than are narrow-bodied craft. This is partly from the recession in Asia as of this writing. Most of the Pacific fleet are wide-bodies; and with the decline of demand, a surplus developed. Some aircraft are more desirable for freighters than others. For example, in the air freight business, some McDonnell Douglas aircraft are viewed as virtually indestructible and valuable because they can fly (almost) indefinitely.

# Servicing

Servicing is important in many ABS sectors, but it is crucial in a lease-backed aircraft deal, especially when the craft must be re-marketed when their lease terms expire before the term of the aircraft ABS. It is the servicer's responsibility to re-lease the aircraft. To fulfill that function in a timely and efficient manner, the servicer must be both well-established and well-regarded by the industry.

As Moody's states, the servicer "should have a large and diverse presence in the global aircraft marketplace in terms of the number of aircraft controlled. Market share drives the ability of a servicer to meet aircraft market demand and deal with distressed airlines."4

The servicer is also the key to maintaining value of the aircraft, through monitoring usage of the craft by lessees. If a lessee is not maintaining an aircraft properly, it is the servicer's responsibility to correct that situation. Because of servicers' vital role to the securitization, the rating agencies spend a great deal of effort ascertaining how well a servicer is likely to perform.

# Defaults

In addition to the risk from needing to re-lease craft, rating agencies are also concerned about possible defaults. Because of protections under Section 1110 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, and international statutes that favor aircraft creditors, there is relatively little risk of losing an aircraft. There are, however, repossession costs, plus the loss of revenues during the time it takes to reposseess and restore the aircraft to generating lease income.


The rating agencies will "stress" an aircraft financing by assuming a default rate, a period of time, and cost for repossessing the aircraft. A major input into base default assumptions is the credit rating of airline lessees. For this part of the review, the ABS rating analyst relies on the corporate rating of the airline.

While there is little risk of not recovering the aircraft in event of a default, the rating agencies do carefully review the legal and political risks that the aircraft may be exposed to, and evaluate the ease with which the aircraft can be repossessed in the event of a default, especially if any of the lessees are in developing countries.

# Enhancement Levels

In aircraft ABS, as in every other ABS sector, the rating agencies attempt to set enhancement levels that are consistent across asset types. That is, the risk of not receiving interest or principal in an aircraft deal rated a particular credit level should be the same as in a credit card or home equity deal (or, for that matter, even for a corporate bond) of the same rating. The total enhancement ranges from  $34\%$  to  $47\%$ .

Since the early deals, there has been a change in enhancement levels. Early deals depended largely on the sale of aircraft to meet principal payments on the bonds. Since then, the aircraft ABS relied more on lease revenue. Since lease revenue is more robust than sales revenue, the enhancement levels have declined. To understand why a "sales" deal requires more enhancement than a "lease" deal, consider the following. If an aircraft is sold during a recession, the deal suffers that entire decline in market value. On the other hand, if a lease rate declines during a recession, the deal sustains only the loss on the re-lease rate.

# Franchise-Loan Backed Securities

Franchise loan securities are a hybrid between the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and ABS markets. They are often backed by real estate, as in CMBS, but the deal structures are more akin to ABS. Also, franchise loans resemble Small Business Administration (SBA) loans and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) more than they do consumer loan-backed ABS securities. Greater reliance is placed on examining each franchise loan within the pool than on using aggregate statistics. In a pool of 100 to 200 loans (typical franchise loan group sizing) each loan is significant. By contrast within the consumer sector, any individual loan from a pool of 10,000 loans (as in home equity deals) does not represent as large a percentage, thus is not considered quite as important.

Franchise loans are similar to SBA loans in average size, maturity, and end use. But whereas most SBA loans are floating-rate loans indexed to the prime rate, most securitized franchise loans are fixed-rate; if they are floating, they are likely to be LIBOR-linked.

Franchise loans are used to fund working capital, expansion, acquisitions, and renovation of existing franchise facilities.

The typical securitized deal borrower owns a large number of units, as opposed to being a small individual owner of a single franchise unit. However, individual loans are usually made on a single unit, secured either by the real estate, the building, or the equipment in the franchise.

The consolidation within the industry and the emergence of large operators of numerous franchise units have improved industry credit performance. A company owning 10 to 100 units is in a better position to weather a financial setback than is the owner of a single franchise location.

Loans can be either fixed or floating rate, and are typically closed-end, fully amortizing with maturities of 7 to 20 years. If secured by equipment, maturities range from 7 to 10 years. If they are secured by real estate, maturities usually extend 15 to 20 years.

# Security Characteristics

Because franchise loan collateral is relatively new to the ABS market, and deal size is small, most of these securitized packages have been issued as a 144A. Issuers also prefer the 144A execution for competitive reasons, because they are reluctant to publicly disclose details of their transactions.

Deals typically range from  $100 -$ 300 million, and are customarily backed by 150 to 200 loans. Average loan size is around \$500,000, while individual loans may range from  \$15,000 -2,000,000.

Most deals are structured as sequential-pay bonds with a senior/sub-ordinate credit enhancement. Prepayments can occur if a franchise unit closes or is acquired by another franchisor. However, few prepayments have been experienced within securitized deals as of this writing, and most loans carry steep prepayment penalties that effectively discourage rate refinancing. Those penalties often equal  $1\%$  of the original balance of the loan.

# Major Sectors

The vast majority of franchise operations consist of three types of retail establishments: restaurants, specialty retail stores, and retail energy outlets. The restaurant category has three major subsectors: quick service restaurants (QSRs), casual restaurants, and family restaurants. Exhibit 17.5 shows some of the franchise "concepts" that fall within these categories.

# EXHIBIT 17.5 Types of Retail Establishments

# Restaurants

Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs):

McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Pizza Hut

Casual

T.G.I. Fridays, Red Lobster, Don Pablo's

Family

Denny's, Perkins, Friendly's

Specialty Retail

Convenience stores, Blockbuster, 7-11, Jiffy Lube,

Meineke Muffler

Energy Retail

Texaco

A "concept" is simply another name for a particular franchise idea, since each franchise seeks to differentiate itself from its competitors. Hence, even though Burger King and Wendy's are both QSRs specializing in sandwiches, their menu and style of service are sufficiently different that each has its own business/marketing plan—or "concept." For example, Wendy's has long promoted the "fresh" market, as the firm mandated fresh (not frozen) beef patties in their hamburgers, and helped pioneer the industry's salad bars. Burger King is noted for its "flame broiled" burgers, as well as having it "your way."

In addition to segmenting the industry by functional types, it is also segmented by credit grades. For example, Fitch developed a credit tiering system based on expected recoveries of defaulted loans. Tier I concepts have a much lower expected default level than Tier II concepts, etc. Many financial and operational variables go into these tiered ratings, including the number of outlets nationwide (larger, successful concepts benefit from better exposure, national advertising, etc.); concept "seasoning" (especially if it has weathered a recession); and viability in today's competitive environment (yesterday's darlings may have become oversaturated, or unable to respond to changing tastes or trends by revamping and updating).

# Risk Considerations

There are several risk factors to be aware of when comparing franchise loan pools, and the following are some of the most important.

Number of Loans/Average Size High concentrations of larger loans represent increased risk, just as in any other pool of securitized loans.

Loan-to-Value Ratio LTVs can be based on either real estate or business values. It is important to determine which is being used in a particular deal in order to make a valid comparison with other franchise issues. Note that when business value is used to compute LTV, it is common for a nationally recognized accounting firm to provide the valuation estimate.

Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio The fixed charge coverage ratio (FCCR) is calculated as follows:

$$
\mathrm {F C C R} = \frac {\text {a d j u s t e d f r e e c a s h f l o w l e s s o c u p a n c y c o s t s}}{\text {o c c u p a n c y c o s t s p l u s d e b t s e r v i c e}}
$$

Typical FCCRs range from 1.00-3.00, and average around 1.5. A deal with most unit FCCRs below 1.5 would be viewed as having greater risk than average, while one with most FCCRs above 1.5 would be perceived as having less risk than average.

Diversification As in all ABS sectors, a primary risk factor is the degree of diversification. In a franchise loan deal, important areas for diversification include franchise owner, concept, and location.

A typical franchise pool includes loans to 10-15 franchisees, each having taken out loans on 5-20 individual units. A large concentration of loans to any single franchise operator might increase deal risk. However, such concentration is sometimes allowed, and rating agencies will not penalize extensively, if that particular franchisee has a very strong record and the individual franchise units have strong financials. It might even be better to have a high concentration of high quality loans than a more diverse pool of weaker credits.

Concept diversification is also important. Franchise loans extend for 10 to 20 years, and a profitable concept today may become unprofitable as the loans mature.

It is not as important that pooled loans include representation across several major sectors (such as more than one restaurant subsector, or loans from all three major groups). Many finance companies specialize in one or two segments of the industry, and know their area well. Thus a deal from only one of the major sectors does not add any measurable risk as long as there is diversification by franchisee and concept.

Geographical diversification is also important, as it reduces risk associated with regional economic recessions.

Control of Collateral A key factor in the event of borrower (franchisee) default is control of the collateral. If a franchise loan is secured by a fee simple mortgage, the lender controls disposition of collateral in a bankruptcy. However, if that collateral is a leasehold interest (especially if the lessor is a third party and not the franchisor), the lender may not be able to control disposition in the event of default.

# Rate Reduction Bonds

The concept of rate reduction bonds (RRBs)—also known as stranded costs or stranded assets—grew out of the movement to deregulate the electric utility industry and bring about a competitive market environment for electric power. Deregulating the electric utility market was complicated by large amounts of "stranded assets" already on the books of many electric utilities. These stranded assets were commitments that had been undertaken by utilities at an earlier time with the understanding that they would be recoverable in utility rates to be approved by the states' utility commissions. However, in a competitive environment for electricity, these assets would likely become uneconomical, and utilities would no longer be assured that they could charge a high enough rate to recover the costs. To compensate investors of these utilities, a special tariff was proposed. This tariff, which would be collected over a specified period of time, would allow the utility to recover its stranded costs.

This tariff, which is commonly known as the competitive transition charge (or CTC), is created through legislation. State legislatures allow utilities to levy a fee, which is collected from their customers. Although there is an incremental fee to the consumer, the presumed benefit is that the utility can charge a lower rate as a result of deregulation. This reduction in rates would more than offset the competitive transition charge. In order to facilitate the securitization of these fees, legislation typically designates the revenue stream from these fees as a statutory property right. These rights may be sold to an SPV, which may then issue securities backed by future cash flows from the tariff.

The result is a structured security similar in many ways to other ABS products, but different in one critical aspect—the underlying asset in a RRB deal is created by legislation, which is not the case for other ABS products.

In the first quarter of 2001 there was a good deal of concern regarding RRBs. The sector came under intense scrutiny as a result of the financial problems experienced by California's major utilities. Yet despite the bankruptcy motion filed by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) in 2001—a bellwether issuer of RRBs—rating agencies maintained their triple-A ratings on California's existing RRB issues. This is not the first time the RRB sector had found itself in turmoil. Over much of 1998, the sector was roiled by a movement in California to overturn the existing legislation which had been created specifically for RRB securitization. This put existing RRB issues in jeopardy; however, the ultimate result (voter initiative was defeated) proved to be positive for this product. The ability of this asset class to retain its rating despite a significant credit crisis at an underlying utility, as well as a serious challenge to the legislation that allows for the creation of these securities, speaks volumes for the soundness of the structures of RRB deals.


# Structure

As noted previously, state regulatory authorities and/or state legislatures must take the first step in creating RRB issues. State regulatory commissions decide how much, if any, of a specific utility's stranded assets will be recaptured via securitization. They will also decide upon an acceptable time frame and collection formula to be used to calculate the tariff (the CTC). When this legislation is finalized, the utility is free to proceed with the securitization process.

The basic structure of an RRB issue is straightforward. The utility sells its rights to future CTC cash flows to an SPV created for the sole purpose of purchasing these assets and issuing debt to finance this purchase. In most cases, the utility itself will act as the servicer since it collects the CTC payment from its customer base along with the typical electric utility bill. Upon issuance, the utility receives the proceeds of the securitization (less the fees associated with issuing a deal), effectively reimbursing the utility for its stranded costs immediately.

RRBs usually have a "true-up" mechanism. This mechanism allows the utility to recalculate the CTC on a periodic basis over the term of the deal. Because the CTC is initially calculated based on projections of utility usage and the ability of the servicer to collect revenues, actual collection experience may differ from initial projections. In most cases, the utility can re-examine actual collections, and if the variance is large enough (generally a  $2\%$  difference), the utility will be allowed to revise the CTC charge. This true-up mechanism provides cash flow stability as well as credit enhancement to the bondholder.

# Enhancement Levels

Credit enhancement levels required by the rating agencies for RRB deals are very low relative to other ABS asset classes. Although exact amounts and forms of credit enhancement may vary by deal, most transactions require little credit enhancement because the underlying asset (the CTC) is a statutory asset and is not directly affected by economic factors or other exogenous variables. Furthermore, the true-up mechanism virtually assures cash-flow stability to the bondholder.

As an example, the Detroit Edison Securitization Funding 1 issued in March 2001 was structured with  $0.50\%$  initial cash enhancement (funded at closing) and  $0.50\%$  overcollateralization (to be funded in equal semiannual increments over the term of the transactions). This total of  $1\%$  credit enhancement is minuscule in comparison to credit cards (for example), which typically require credit enhancement in the  $12\% - 15\%$  range for large bank issuers.

# Unique Risks

RRBs are subject to risks that are very different from those associated with more traditional structured products (e.g., credit cards, HELs, etc.). For example, risks involving underwriting standards do not exist in the RRB sector, since the underlying asset is an artificial construct. Underwriting standards are a critical factor in evaluating the credit of most other ABS. Also, factors that tend to affect the creditworthiness of many other ABS products—such as levels of consumer credit or the economic environment—generally do not have a direct effect RRBs. Instead, other unique factors must be considered when evaluating this sector. The most critical risks revolve around the legislative process and environment plus the long-term ability of the trust to collect future revenues to support the security's cash flows.

In examining a specific RRB deal, several points must be considered.

■ Is the CTC determined by legislation to be a property right? If the legislation defines the fee as a property right, then the utility may sell these rights to an SPV for securitization.
■ Is the transfer considered a true sale? This determines actual ownership of the asset. A true sale safeguards the trust from future claims that may be made against the utility itself, and fully separates the assets from the utility (this true sale now allows for current California RRBs to maintain their triple-A ratings).
■ Is the CTC irrevocable? Since the CTC is created by legislation, it is important to consider whether future legislation could challenge or modify the existing legislation. It is also wise to consider the overall legislative environment, to attempt quantifying the likelihood of any future challenge to existing legislation.
■ Is the utility a good generator and servicer? Since the asset that securitizes an RRB deal is based on a future cash flow stream, the ability of a utility to generate and collect fees must be considered. Electric power is an essential service, so even utilities that find themselves in financial distress usually continue to generate power and collect fees (as is the case in California as of this writing).

Credit card asset backed securities (ABS) have been issued in the public debt market since 1987. Over the years, they have become the largest and most liquid sector in the ABS market. Average annual new issuance of credit card ABS since 1995 has been about  \$46 billion, with a peak amount of\$ 58.2 billion in 2001. Because of its liquidity, transparency, and relatively high credit quality issuers, credit card ABS has become something of a safe haven in times of trouble for ABS investors. Indeed, investors making their first foray into ABS generally dip their toes into credit cards before diving in to the many other asset types available.

The size of the credit card ABS sector corresponds with the growth in the credit card market overall as consumers have come to rely on credit cards as a convenient method of payment for an expanding universe of goods and services, and as a means of accessing credit. In this chapter, we summarize the key structural features of credit card securitizations and provide an overview of the credit card ABS market.

# SECURITIZATION OF CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES

The earliest credit card securitizations in the late 1980s were executed as a means of diversifying the funding sources for banks active in the credit card market. In the early 1990s, the banking industry faced the imposition of stricter capital standards by regulators. Securitization provided a vehicle to help meet these new standards by reducing balance sheet assets and thereby improving regulatory capital ratios. Securitization also allowed for specialized credit card banks to enter the market and grow rapidly without having to rely heavily on customer deposit accounts as a funding source. These specialty banks, such as MBNA, First USA, and Capital One, were able to access the credit markets directly and achieve funding costs that were more comparable with established bankcard issuers. Much of the increased competition and innovation in the credit card market seen during the 1990s can be traced to these banks, which could not have grown as rapidly as they did without the benefits afforded by securitization.


# Basic Master Trust Structure

The structure used for credit card securitization until 1991 was a standalone trust formed with a dedicated pool of credit card accounts and the receivables generated by those accounts. Each securitization required a new trust and a new pool of collateral. Since 1991, the master trust has become the predominant structure used in the credit card market (see Exhibit 18.1). As the name implies, the credit card issuer establishes a single trust that can accept numerous additions of accounts and receivables and issue additional securities. All of the securities issued by the master trust are supported by the cash flows from all of the receivables contributed to it. The collateral pool is not segregated to support any individual securities.

EXHIBIT 18.1 Basic Master Trust Structure

Step 1: Receivables from designated accounts are transferred to the master trust.
Step 2: Pro rata share of charge-offs and cash flows are allocated to investors.
Step 3: Pro rata share of charge-offs and cash flows are allocated to the seller.

For the credit card issuer, this structure lowers costs and provides greater flexibility because a new trust need not be established using a unique set of accounts each time additional securities are issued. From the investors' point of view, assessing the credit quality of a new issue requires less effort because there is only one pool of collateral to review. As the collateral pool grows, it becomes more diversified. While the characteristics of the collateral pool can change over time due to changes in interest rates, underwriting criteria, industry competition, and so on, any change in a master trust would be more gradual than would the differences in stand alone pools.

# Master Owner Trust Structures

The state of the art in credit card structures has evolved since 2000 to the master note trust or master owner trust (MOT) structure. The most prolific credit card ABS issuers have already adopted, or are in the process of readying, issuance vehicles that make use of the latest technology. The securities issued by the MOT are still backed by a revolving pool of credit card receivables, and the credit analysis required of the underlying collateral pool is not affected. However, there are important structural differences from previously issued credit card ABS using earlier master trust technology.

Most issuers adopting the MOT structure already have existing credit card master trusts, and some banks service more than one outstanding master trust because of the consolidation that has taken place in the credit card industry. Exhibit 18.2 presents an example of a MOT structured for an issuer currently active in the ABS market. The issuer's existing credit card master trust issues a "collateral certificate," which is treated like any other series issued by the master trust. The collateral certificate represents an undivided interest in the assets of the master trust, and is allocated its proportionate share of principal collections, finance charges, losses, and servicing fees. For credit card banks with more than one existing credit card master trust, it is conceivable that each one could issue a collateral certificate that could be used to back ABS. The cash flows allocated to the collateral certificate are passed through to the MOT. Securities are issued by the MOT to ABS investors.

Credit card ABS issuers may prefer the MOT structure for several different reasons. First, MOT structures can incorporate flexibility similar to that of a corporate medium-term-note program. For example, different classes of a series can be issued at different times, in varying sizes, and with different maturity profiles. Flexibility of this sort allows the issuer to be opportunistic with regard to the market timing of a new issue, and to tailor securities to a target investor base. This characteris- tic of the MOT is sometimes referred to as a "de-linked" issuance structure because the AAA securities can be issued separately from the A-rated or BBB-rated securities that provide credit enhancement for the senior notes. Most credit card ABS currently outstanding have been issued as a single series with senior and subordinate classes issued concurrently and having the same maturity. The subordinate classes support only the senior class with which they were issued.


In the MOT structure, all of the subordinate classes outstanding support all of the senior classes outstanding. These are known as "shared enhancement series" (see Exhibit 18.2). Senior securities can only be issued to the extent that there is a sufficient amount of subordinate notes already outstanding. For example, in order to issue Class B securities, there must be a sufficient amount of Class C notes outstanding to support them. A "sufficient amount" is that amount determined by the rating agencies to provide credit enhancement to maintain the desired ratings on the notes.

EXHIBIT 18.2 Master Owner Trust Structure

Shared Enhancement Series

In turn, to issue Class A securities there must be the appropriate amount of Class B and Class C notes outstanding. The subordinate notes are allowed to have a different maturity date than the Class A notes. If a class of subordinate notes matures prior to the senior class, then a replacement subordinate note must be issued prior to the existing subordinate note's maturity. To the extent that a replacement note is not issued before paying the maturing note, then principal collections will be deposited into an account that will be used to support the senior notes. Thus, the senior notes will always have the required amount of credit enhancement outstanding. Senior notes benefit from subordination up to and including the required amount. They do not have the benefit of subordinate notes issued in excess of the required amount. Even if de-linked series are issued, other securities issued by MOTs still can be structured to allow for the issuance of credit card ABS in a single series with "linked" subordinate classes that do not provide shared enhancement (classic credit card ABS). Series 2 and Series 3 in Exhibit 18.2 depict such a scenario.

Another reason for the MOT structure is that issuers can expand their potential investor base by structuring securities to be issued as notes rather than as passthrough certificates. By doing this, all classes of a series issued, including the subordinate classes, can achieve ERISA eligibility. This feature is important because pension funds, a significant source of fixed income investor funds, can only buy securities that meet ERISA guidelines. In this way, the total investor base for credit card ABS expands, especially for the subordinate bonds where liquidity has lagged the senior classes. In addition to expanding the investor base, the flexibility in the MOT structure allows for better and more timely execution of reverse-inquiry issuance.

# Investor Interest/Seller Interest

Credit card master trusts allocate cash flow between the ABS investors and the credit card issuer. The "investor interest" is simply the principal amount owed to investors in the ABS. The "seller interest" is a residual ownership interest that the credit card issuer is required to maintain. This seller interest aligns the incentives of the seller with that of the investors because it has a pari passu claim on the cash flows. The minimum required seller interest for most master trusts tends to be in the  $4\%$  to  $7\%$  range of outstanding receivables. The seller interest in a master trust is likely to be higher in practice, in some cases much higher, than the minimum. For example, the average seller interest for trusts included in the Banc One Capital Markets Credit Card Performance Index tend to be in the  $20\%$  to  $25\%$  range. The actual level of seller interest will be driven by the issuer's strategy with regard to its use of securitization for its funding needs.

The seller interest absorbs seasonal fluctuations in the amount of outstanding receivables, and is allocated dilutions from returned merchandise and ineligible receivables. The seller interest does not provide credit enhancement for the ABS. Credit enhancement for the ABS, discussed more fully later, is provided by subordinated securities, which are part of the investor interest, or by other means provided for in the structure of the series.

As an issuer's credit card business grows, accounts that meet the eligibility criteria can be added to a master trust. An account addition normally requires rating agency approval unless it is a relatively small percentage of the current balance (usually  $10\%$  to  $15\%$ ). Sellers are obligated to add accounts if the seller interest falls below its required minimum level. If the seller is unable to add accounts to the trust, then an early amortization event is triggered and investors begin receiving principal payments immediately. The risk of an early amortization gives the seller a powerful incentive to keep the seller interest above the minimum level.

# The Credit Card ABS Life Cycle

Under normal circumstances, the life cycle of credit card ABS is divided into two periods: the revolving period and the amortization period. We discuss each period below.

# Revolving Period

During the revolving period, investors receive interest payments only. Principal collections on the receivables are used to purchase new receivables or to purchase a portion of the seller interest if there are not enough new receivables generated by the designated accounts. The revolving period is used by an issuer to finance short-term credit card loans over a longer time period. The revolving period is used to maintain a stable average life and to create more certainty for the expected maturity date.

# Amortization Period

After the end of the revolving period, the amortization period begins and principal collections are used to repay ABS investors. The amortization period may be longer or shorter depending on the monthly payment rate of the accounts in the master trust. The payment rate is the percentage of the outstanding receivables balance paid each month. Trusts with lower monthly payment rates will require longer amortization periods. For example, credit card ABS with a 5-year expected maturity might revolve for 48 months, and then enter amortization for the final 12 months of its life. This part of the credit card ABS life cycle is usually accomplished through one of two mechanisms: controlled amortization or controlled accumulation.

EXHIBIT 18.3 Controlled Amortization

In a controlled amortization, principal is paid to the ABS investors in equal payments (see Exhibit 18.3). The example assumes one series issued out of the master trust with two classes, a Class A senior certificate and a Class B subordinated certificate. During the 4-year revolving period, investors receive only interest payments. Principal collections are used to purchase new receivables. The total amount of receivables varies over time, and these fluctuations are absorbed by the seller interest. At the beginning of year five, the revolving period ends and a controlled amortization begins. Investors receive principal payments in 12 equal installments. Principal collections not needed to repay ABS investors are used to purchase new receivables. Interest payments continue based on the declining principal balance of the ABS. The Class B amount remains fixed during Class A amortization, and the seller interest grows proportionately until the ABS investors are repaid.

In a controlled accumulation, principal collections needed to repay ABS investors are deposited into a trust account each month and held until maturity after the end of the revolving period (see Exhibit 18.4). This example again assumes a simple senior/subordinated structure and a 4-year revolving period. After the end of the revolving period, principal collections are trapped in an account in 12 equal installments to be used to repay the Class A investors. Excess principal collections are used to purchase new receivables. Interest payments to investors during the accumulation period are made based on the original outstanding invested amount. A single "bullet" payment of principal is made at maturity to the ABS investors. This structural device developed as a way to emulate the cash flow characteristics of a corporate bond.

# Early Amortization

Under certain circumstances, such as poor credit performance or a financially troubled servicer, an early amortization of the ABS could occur. Trigger events are put in place to reduce the length of time that investors would be exposed to a troubled transaction. Exhibit 18.5 lists common early amortization trigger events found in credit card master trusts. If an early amortization trigger is hit, then a transaction that is in its revolving period stops revolving and immediately begins to pass prin icipal collections through to the ABS investors. One structural enhancement available to protect investors allows for principal to be passed through on an uncontrolled, or rapid amortization, basis. This mechanism diverts principal due to the seller toward payment of the ABS in order to get investors repaid more quickly.


# Cash Flow Allocations

Credit card master trusts may have a large number of series outstanding at any one time. As a result, the allocation of cash flows can become complex. This section discusses the key elements of master trust cash flows.

# Groups

A credit card master trust may utilize the concept of a "group," which is a structural device used to help allocate cash flow. Within the hierarchy of the master trust, one or more groups may be established, and each series of securities issued to investors will be assigned to a group. At its highest level, the master trust allocates cash on a pro rata basis between the investor interest and seller interest. The investor interest is subdivided further on a pro rata basis at the group level. While many trusts have only one group that encompasses all of the series issued, other trusts may have two or more. In trusts with more than one group, series with similar characteristics could be grouped together. For example, a master trust with two groups could place all of the fixed-rate coupon series in one group and all of the floating-rate coupon series in a second group. The sharing of excess principal or finance charge collections, if called for in the master trust structure, will be determined at the group level.

# Finance Charge Allocations

The components of the finance charge collected by a master trust include the monthly interest on the account balance, annual or late fees, recoveries on charged-off receivables, interchange, $^{1}$  and discounted receivables. $^{2}$  When expressed as a percentage of the trust's receivables balance, finance charges are called the portfolio yield.

Finance charge collections are allocated by most master trusts pro rata based on the outstanding invested amount of each series. This "floating" allocation adjusts as a series amortizes or accumulates principal collections in a principal funding account. Excess finance charge collections may or may not be shared by series in the same group depending on the structure of the master trust. Some master trusts, such as Discover Card Master Trust, utilize a "fixed" allocation of finance charges. In this structure, the proportion to be allocated to a particular series is fixed at the end of the revolving period and is based on the original principal balance of the series. This structure allows for a greater relative proportion of finance charge collections to go to amortizing series. In an early amortization, a portion of the seller's finance charges can be reallocated to investors to cover any potential shortfall when the portfolio is under stress.

Master trusts that allocate finance charges pro rata based on the size of the series invested amount are known as "nonsocialized" master trusts. Finance charges are available to each series to cover its allocated charge-offs, servicing fees, and to pay the coupon to the ABS investors each month. Some nonsocialized master trusts do not share excess finance charges. In other nonsocialized trusts, once all of the expenses are covered, the series included in the same group may share excess finance charges. If excess finance charges are shared by the series in a group, then they are distributed to the other series based on need. Any excess finance charges left over are considered excess spread.

The advantage of a nonsocialized master trust is that the risk of early amortization can be isolated at the series level. The disadvantage is that high coupon series are at a relatively greater risk of early amortization if there is a shortfall in finance charge collections. The sharing of excess finance charges helps mitigate, but does not eliminate, this risk. Most master trusts, such as the Sears Credit Card Master Trust II, are structured as nonsocialized trusts that allow for sharing excess finance charges.

An alternative structure, used by a small number of credit card ABS issuers, is a "socialized" master trust. In such a structure, finance charges are allocated to series within a group based on need. Need is determined by the costs of each series—the coupon, servicing fees, and allocated charge-offs. Charge-offs are allocated to a series pro rata based on its size within the group. The expenses for the group are the weighted average of the expenses for each series. Series with higher coupon costs will receive a larger allocation of finance charge collections. The advantage of socialization is that finance charge collections are combined to help support higher cost series, and thus help avoid an early amortization. However, the fates of all series are linked. All series in a group will make payments as expected, or they will all enter early amortization together. Citibank Credit Card Master Trust I and Household Affinity Master Trust I are two examples of socialized master trusts.


# Principal Collections

Principal collections are allocated on a pro rata basis to each series in the same group based on the size of its invested amount. The allocation of principal to each series is determined by where it is in the ABS life cycle. Series that are in their revolving period receive no principal collections. Their principal collections can be reallocated, and may be shared with other series that are amortizing. Sharing principal collections is a structural enhancement that helps to ensure the timely payment of principal to ABS investors. Principal that is not needed to repay investors is reinvested in new receivables.

For a series in its amortization or accumulation period, principal collections allocated to it will be used to repay investors. The allocation of principal is determined by the size of the invested amount of the series at the end of its revolving period. Even though the certificates are amortizing, the allocation percentage to the series will be fixed based on its original invested amount. If the credit card ABS accumulate principal or amortize over 12 months, then  $\frac{1}{12}$  of the principal amount of that series will be paid to it. Principal collections in excess of what is necessary for amortization, depending on the structure of the trust, may be shared with other series in the same group as needed to meet their amortization schedules. Otherwise, excess principal is used to purchase additional receivables.

# Credit Enhancement

In order to establish an investment grade rating on credit card ABS, credit enhancement is necessary to absorb losses. The amount of credit enhancement needed will vary from one master trust to another based on the desired rating level and the credit performance of an issuer's credit card portfolio. Early credit card transactions carried letters-of-credit from commercial banks as credit enhancement. However, downgrades of a number of credit enhancers exposed ABS investors to downgrades on their investments. While some issuers still rely on surety bonds, internal forms of credit enhancement have become the norm.

# Excess Spread

Excess spread is perhaps the most important measure of the health of a credit card master trust, is a key early amortization trigger, and is the first line of defense against losses. Excess spread is simply the cash flow left over each month after the investor coupon, servicing fees, and charge-offs have been allocated to each series. The calculation of excess spread is fairly straightforward, as shown in Exhibit 18.6, with the values expressed as an annualized percentage of the outstanding receivables balance. If the 3-month moving average of excess spread for a particular series in a non-socialized master trust falls below zero, then an early amortization event with regard to that series has occurred. In socialized master trusts, the excess spread for all series in the same group will be equal because they share finance charge collections based on the weighted-average cost of the group. An early amortization trigger based on a decline in excess spread will, therefore, affect all series in the group.


# Cash Collateral Account

A cash collateral account (CCA) is a cash reserve account funded at closing and held by the trust. The cash to fund the CCA is usually lent by a third party and invested in high-grade, short-term securities. The CCA is used to protect against shortfalls in cash flow due to rising charge-offs, and any draws on it are reimbursed from future excess spread.

# Collateral Invested Amount

An alternative to a cash reserve is a collateral invested amount (CIA), which is a privately placed subordinated tranche of a series. The CIA is placed with a third-party investor, and the investor may or may not require a rating on the CIA. The CIA is an improvement for the issuer over the CCA because this tranche is backed by collateral from the master trust rather than cash. Like the CCA, the CIA is available to protect against shortfalls in cash flow due to declining excess spread. The CIA tranche has the benefit of a spread account, which is not available as credit enhancement to other investors. Draws on the CIA also are reimbursed through excess spread.

EXHIBIT 18.7 Credit Card Series Structure

# Subordination

As credit card ABS have evolved, structures have become more complex. Letters-of-credit have given way to CCAs or CIAs, which in turn have been replaced with rated subordinated securities. The subordinated classes also are placed with public ABS investors and tend to be rated in the single-A or triple-B categories. A typical structure might include AAA-rated Class A senior certificates, a single-A rated Class B subordinated tranche, and a Class C tranche issued to investors rated at triple-B level (see Exhibit 18.7). The Class C tranche is credit enhanced by a spread account that can trap additional cash out of excess spread if certain credit performance triggers are tripped. Using subordinated tranches allows the issuer to monetize a larger portion of its collateral portfolio, and allows it to reach a wider investor audience. As noted above, the development of the master owner trust is the latest step toward a liquid, ERISA-eligible, subordinated credit card ABS market sector.

# Rating Agency Considerations

Rating agency criteria have evolved over time as new structures, such as rated C-pieces or the master owner trust, have been introduced. In general, the rating criteria from the agencies are not substantially different for the MOT structure than it was for the classic credit card master trusts. Stressing the historical performance of critical variables related to the cash flows tests the structural integrity of credit card ABS. The rating agencies generally require three to five years of historical data, and will examine vintage data in order to estimate loss curves and the ultimate level of charge-offs. Once baseline performance is determined, then different cash flow stresses are used depending on the desired rating. The key quantitative variables for analyzing credit card securitizations include portfolio yield, charge-offs, monthly payment rate, monthly purchase rate, and the investor coupon. Each is discussed below.


■ Portfolio yield, as noted above, is a measure of the income generated by the credit card receivables. While portfolio yield is driven largely by the APR on accounts and fees, usage by account holders also plays an important role. All else being equal, a portfolio with proportionately more revolving accounts relative to convenience users will translate into a higher portfolio yield.
- Charge-offs are the credit losses experienced by the portfolio, and are taken by most issuers at 180 days past due. Peak losses on a static pool basis for credit card accounts have been observed at about 24 months of seasoning.
The monthly payment rate is an important variable in the analysis because high payment rates can be a source of strength and implied credit enhancement. A large proportion of convenience users, while depressing portfolio yield, can sharply increase payment rates. A higher payment rate means that investors can be repaid more quickly during an early amortization.
Related to the payment rate is the purchase rate, which is the generation of new receivables by the designated accounts. Higher purchase rates mean more receivables are being generated to support outstanding ABS. Bankruptcy of the seller of the receivables, such as a department store chain, is the main risk with regard to the purchase rate because cardholders may stop using the card. As the amount of receivables declines, the credit quality of the portfolio may deteriorate.
Floating-rate ABS generally require more credit enhancement than fixed-rate transactions because the rating agencies assume in their stress scenarios that market interest rates increase dramatically. Higher funding costs for the ABS reduce the available excess spread.

The stress tests run by the rating agencies force portfolio yields, payment rates, and purchase rates down sharply at the same time that charge-offs rise. This combination compresses excess spread and causes an early amortization of the transaction. Exhibit 18.8 shows generic stress scenarios for credit card ABS transactions for Standard & Poor's. The rating agencies may deviate from these benchmark levels depending on the qualitative factors of a seller's business. Some of the key qualitative elements that go into the rating analysis are new account underwriting, servicing and collections, marketing, card type (private label versus general purpose), geographic diversification, strategic objectives of the firm, account seasoning, and the competitive position of issuer. These qualitative factors, among others, determine how the generic stress factors will be modified and applied to an individual issuer's credit card portfolio.


# THE CREDIT CARD ABS MARKET

Credit card ABS is the largest and most liquid part of the ABS market. In 2001, total new public issuance of credit card ABS reached  \$58.2 billion, and we expect issuance to remain at high levels in the near future. In addition, there are about\$ 270 billion of credit card ABS outstanding. The large number of issuers and dollar amount outstanding makes this sector particularly active for secondary trading. Consequently, pricing spreads for credit card ABS tend to be used as a benchmark for comparison to other ABS sectors.

During the past decade, the credit card industry has experienced rapid growth and increasing competition. That dynamic culminated in sharp increases in outstanding receivables in 1995 and 1996, and was reflected in the amount of new credit card ABS issued during that period. However, rapid growth and intense competition also led to problems with asset quality (see Exhibit 18.9). Charge-offs rose steadily and excess spreads dropped from the middle of 1995 through the middle of 1997 as consumer bankruptcy rates reached record levels. It has been generally acknowledged that competition for new accounts, the use of introductory "teaser rates," and weaker underwriting led to many of the credit problems seen in the credit card sector.

EXHIBIT 18.9 Banc One Capital Markets Credit Card Performance Indices

Credit performance stabilized in the late 1990s as credit card companies re-examined their marketing strategies and underwriting procedures. Charge-off rates slowly fell back to about  $5\%$  by the summer of 2000, but excess spreads remained relatively high as banks instituted more thorough risk-based pricing of customer accounts (see Exhibit 18.9). As the economy slowed and the recession took hold, charge-off rates began to climb again, and peaked at about  $6\%$  by year-end 2001. Nevertheless, excess spreads have increased sharply due to dramatically lower interest rates. The majority of ABS are issued as floating-rate notes. As LIBOR rates fell, funding costs dropped, and margins on credit card master trusts soared to record levels.

# Industry Consolidation

To better meet their credit underwriting and customer service needs, stronger credit card companies invested heavily in technology, and increased their scale of operations to spread the costs of that investment over more accounts. Many smaller or weaker firms have been unable or unwilling to meet the challenge of the new competitive environment, and have decided to exit the business. As a result, consolidation has been one of the key themes in the credit card business for the past few years. To illustrate, at the start of 1987 there were slightly more than  \$80 billion of credit card receivables outstanding in the United States, and the top ten credit card companies had a combined market share of about 40\%$ . By the end of 2000, there were about 700 billion of outstanding credit card receivables, and the top ten credit card companies had a combined market share of  $68\%$  (see Exhibit 18.10).

As the credit card industry has consolidated, so has the market for credit card ABS. The three largest credit card issuers accounted for about  $45\%$  of credit card ABS outstanding as of year-end 2001, and the top five were responsible for approximately  $63\%$ . While consolidation has reduced the number of issuers in the market, the overall credit quality of those that remain has improved. Seven of the top ten sponsors have corporate debt ratings of A2/A or better. From the standpoint of liquidity and issuer quality, this sector is the strongest in the ABS market.

# Credit Card Market Segments

The major issuers of credit card ABS fall into four major categories: commercial banks, consumer finance companies, independent networks, and retailers. Some examples of the issuers in each of these categories follow:

■ Commercial Banks: Bank One, Citibank, Chase, BankAmerica
Consumer Finance: MBNA, Household, Capital One, Providian
Independent Networks: Discover, American Express
■ Retailers: Sears, Target, World Financial Network, Federated

# General Purpose Cards

The credit card ABS market is divided into two major segments: general-purpose cards and private label cards. The larger of these two segments includes transactions sponsored by issuers of general-purpose credit cards. General-purpose credit cards include both Visa and MasterCard cards issued by commercial banks and consumer finance companies, as well as the independent networks of merchants built by Discover Card and American Express. This group of issuers represents the vast majority of the credit card ABS market. Issuers of general-purpose cards tend to price new ABS at tighter spreads relative to private label issuers. Tiering in that market favors the largest, most frequent issuers with stable credit performance. Nevertheless, most issuers price new credit card ABS transactions within a very tight range of only a few basis points. At this point in time, Citibank and MBNA are generally considered to be the benchmark issuers in this market segment.

# Teaser Rate Cards

In an attempt to gain market share in the face of fierce competition, credit card issuers devised a number of innovations to establish brand loyalty with new customers. Low-price cards, with no annual fee and up-front "teaser" rates, have been used to lure customers away from competitors. These accounts often allow the new customer to transfer existing balances from other, higher interest rate cards. The teaser rate usually is in effect for 6 to 12 months, and then steps up to a higher rate based on the borrower's credit risk. Balance transfers have been used to great effect by card issuers, though many borrowers have become adept at rolling balances from one card to another at the end of the teaser rate period. One of the problems with this approach is the potential for adverse selection in the account base. Borrowers with poor credit are more likely to respond to a teaser rate, and may be less likely to roll balances to a new card in the future because they have less credit options. Most credit card banks have moved away from the blanket marketing of teaser rate accounts to concentrate on other ways to establish brand loyalty among cardholders.


# Affinity and Co-Branded Programs

One of the uses of the technological investment made by credit card issuers has been in the customer retention effort. A package of interest rates, credit limits, and other services can be offered to entice customers to stay once the teaser period ends. These packages may come in thousands of possible combinations, and are offered based on the credit profile and card usage patterns of the cardholder. The method of "mass customization" is made possible by the sophisticated computer systems that search for new customers in huge databases, and track the credit performance and profitability of existing customers. One of the most successful issuers practicing a mass customization strategy is Capital One.

Two popular products created by issuers to differentiate themselves in the minds of cardholders and retain them as customers are affinity and co-branded programs. Affinity cards are issued by a bank in association with a special interest group, such as a college alumni association, professional group, or sports team. The group receives a fee from the bank, and the bank uses its affinity program to attract a certain demographic group to use its card. Co-branded cards are programs that associate a bank's credit card with a particular commercial firm. Customers can earn certain rewards from the commercial firm for making purchases with the card, such as mileage awards toward free tickets on airlines, which is probably the most popular of the bank co-brand programs.

# Private Label Credit Cards

The other, much smaller segment of the credit card market includes private label credit cards, which are sponsored by retailers for use in their own stores. This segment has been dominated by issuance from Sears, which represents about one-third of the private label market. Retail credit card accounts are most often viewed by the sponsor as a means to increase sales, and credit underwriting may not be as stringent as it is for general-purpose credit cards. As a result, charge-offs tend to be higher on private label credit card master trusts than they are for general-purpose card master trusts. On the other hand, APRs and portfolio yields do tend to be higher to compensate for the greater risk in the private label portfolio. Private label credit card ABS transactions tend to be less frequent and somewhat smaller, and as result they tend to price at a concession to ABS transactions sponsored by general-purpose card issuers. Nevertheless, good value can be found among private label issuers by investors willing to investigate them.


# CONCLUSION

The credit card ABS market currently is the largest and most liquid asset-backed sector. For this reason, it is viewed by many as a safe haven for ABS investors in stressful market times. Indeed, spreads on credit card ABS are usually the first to recover from market dislocations. Over the past several years, a growing economy, healthy consumer balance sheets, and greater acceptance of credit cards for non-traditional uses led to a sharp increase in outstanding receivables. Meanwhile, the market weathered a deteriorating credit situation from 1995 through 1997. Nevertheless, a growing need for technology and intense competition led to consolidation in the industry, though competition still appears to be quite strong. Increasing issuance in the European market should produce a more global credit card ABS market in coming years, and additional innovations are sure to follow. Given the commitment most credit card issuers have made to the ABS market, it seems likely that the credit card ABS market should continue to be a benchmark sector for the foreseeable future.

The leveraged loan market has evolved since the mid-1980s to an institutional investor-driven segment of the capital markets from the sole province of banks. Though the market retains some of the vestiges of a private market—including cumbersome documentation and transfer provisions and some measure of non-public information—institutional accounts now represent more than  $50\%$  of the funding for leveraged loans. As of September 30, 2001, roughly 80 institutional investors were active in the leveraged loan market.

These accounts are divided into three main segments: (1) retail mutual funds, (2) securitization vehicles, primarily collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), and (3) proprietary accounts of insurance companies, hedge funds, and a small number of pension funds; hedge funds and pensions tend to invest through total rate of return swaps.

As the institutional investor base has grown, banks' appetite for leveraged loans has receded. In fact, most banks now are afflicted with anorexia when it comes to buying new loan assets. Since 1999, the number of banks that have actively bought leveraged loans on a retail basis has withered to 31 as of September 30, 2001 from 110. The reasons are straightforward:
- Most banks are husbanding their capital for fee-generating businesses rather than investing in credit products; in fact, the chance of capturing fees as a memeber of the bond syndicate is one of the most powerful draws to bring banks into leveraged loan syndicates.
■ With default up over this period (discussed later) and credit quality deteriorating, even those banks that remain active have pulled in their horns.
The banking industry has endured wave upon wave of consolidation with underwriting banks buying up many of their best bank investors. Examples: in recent years Fleet Bank has bought Bank of Boston and Summit bank and First Union has bought Corestates and Wachovia.
The Japanese banks have become very reticent players in recent years. During the first three quarters of 2001, these banks bought just  $2\%$  of primary leveraged loans. As recently as 1994, Japanese banks represented  $17\%$  of the primary market.

# WHAT IS A SYNDICATED LOAN?

Syndicated loans are loans that are sufficiently large that they are provided by a group of banks under one master credit agreement, just like bonds. And, just like bonds, the loan is led by an arranger or a group of coarrangers and syndicated to a group of banks and institutional investors.

Syndicating loans has been a practice of banks long before J. Pierpont Morgan came on the scene in the late 1800s and helped to popularize this form of fund raising by tapping European capital providers for American corporations. But the syndicated loan market is a relatively recent innovation. It was more or less invented in the mid-1980s as a way to finance large leveraged buyout loans like RJR Nabisco. The syndicated loan market has evolved over the past decade from something of a backwater lending segment to a capital markets-like model, particularly in the leveraged loan segment where institutional investors now predominate. Today, the leveraged loan market sports many of the trappings of the bond market—though loans continue to be private instruments and loan investors often receive information from the issuer that is not filed with the SEC—including third-party ratings and a trade association focused on increasing the efficacy of settlement and trading, mark-to-market pricing, news and data, and market statistics.

And since the early 1990s, as discussed previously, institutional investors have steadily increased their participation as banks have withdrawn. Institutional investors buy only non-investment grade loans—specifically, only term loans. As a result, in this chapter we'll focus on these tranches, or "institutional loans" in market parlance. These are floating-rate, funded loans with back-end loaded amortization that are, virtually without exception, secured. Most loans are secured by all assets, though there are cases where capital stock in operating units are the primary form of collateral and still others where it is inventories and receivables. Leveraged loans are almost always for non-investment grade or non-rated companies, though there is the occasional BBB or BBB- issuer that is forced to tap the institutional loan market for secured, funded debt. These issuers are usually in the throes of financial distress or a large transaction that requires them to leverage up their balance sheets.


Leveraged loans bought by institutional investors have traditionally paid a rate of interest in the range of  $2.0\%$  to  $5.0\%$  over LIBOR. The issuer is given the option to fix the rate of the loan in 1- to 12-month intervals at the prevailing LIBOR rate plus the spread. In most cases, the issuer is given a great deal of flexibility and can have numerous LIBOR contracts under a single facility. That is, in a 100 million loan, the issuer may have three equal sized LIBOR contracts one of which is set for three months, one for six months, and one for nine months.

# STRUCTURING AND SYNDICATING LOANS

In structuring and syndicating a loan, agent banks must deal with two primary constituencies: (1) the borrower and (2) potential lenders.

The borrower is the client, paying the agent a fee to structure and syndicate the loan. The fee increases with the complexity of the loan. If the loan is a plain vanilla (or standard) loan to an large, high-quality company, there will be little or no fee. And, often, these borrowers will syndicate a loan themselves, using the agent simply to set documentation and administer the process. As the risk of the borrower or the transaction increases, so does the fee. As a result, the most profitable loans are those to leveraged borrowers.

Lenders are the "retail" market for a syndicated loan. An agent must gauge market appetite for a particular credit before pricing it. An agent will price a loan where it believes it will clear the market. The loan market, however, remains unique among the major capital markets because loans are priced and then syndicated over several weeks or months period. In the bond market, by contrast, a bond is priced to market on the day of the offering, ensuring that pricing will clear the market.

Once pricing and structure are set, the agent(s)—often with borrower approval or at least knowledge—will set several commitment tiers for the retail market. Lenders are usually paid an upfront fee based on their commitment tier, with larger commitments bringing larger fees. After the syndication is complete, the agent(s) will make allocations to the syndicate group based on how well the loan was subscribed (how much money was raised). If, for instance, a  \$100 million is raised for a\$ 100 million syndicated loan, lenders will be allocated exactly what they committed. If, however, 200 million was raised, lenders may be allocated only half of the amount they committed.


There are three types of syndications:

Underwritten Deal— In an underwritten deal, the agent or agents guarantee the entire commitment and then syndicate the loan. Even if the agent syndicate less than the committed amount, it must provide the funds. Fully underwritten deals can be used as a competitive tool by agents to win mandates. They also tend to be more richly priced because the agent is on the hook if potential lenders balk.
- Best Efforts—In a best-efforts syndicate, the agent or agents commit to underwrite less than the entire amount of the loan; leaving it at the mercy of the market. If other lenders elect not to join the deal, then the credit will not close. Best-efforts syndications tend to be used for risky borrowers or complex transactions, when the chances that the other lenders will pass on the deal are higher. Pricing and fees tend to be lower than those paid to a fully underwritten syndication.

Club Deal —Smaller deals (usually 200 million or less) that are pre-marketed to a group of relationship banks. The agent is generally a first among equals.

# Buying Syndicated Loans

Investors generally buy loans in the primary or secondary market in initial investments of at least  $2 to$ 5 million and incremental investments of 1 million. As we discuss later, the assignment provisions of loans are cumbersome and transfer fees are often costly.

Most participants say that committing 500 million to the leveraged loan is the minimum required to be a "player" and be consistently invited into the primary by large underwriters. Those who want to commit less generally invest through a fund manager. There are, however, a number of hedge funds that buy opportunistically through total rate of return swaps as part of their overall high-yield investment strategy.

There are four primary ways that institutional investors buy leveraged loans.

# Retail Mutual Funds

At the close of 2001, there were roughly 30 of these funds with net assets of about 23 billion according to one source, Lipper. Most retail loan funds are closed-end, continuously offered vehicles that are redeemable through tenders conducted quarterly. Some of the newer funds, however, have monthly or even daily redemptions. These are the exception, though, not the rule.


# Securitization Vehicles

Since the mid-1990s, loan vehicles—or collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) as they are popularly known—have become the largest form of institutional investment in the loan market. At the end of 2001, these vehicles held roughly  \$70 billion of leveraged loans. Like all asset-backed securities, CLOs carve up the risk into various layers of liabilities, typically a AAA-rated senior tranche, a AA rated senior tranche, a BBB or BB mezzanine tranche and, of course, an equity tranche. The typically run 5 to 7 years and are highly structured with all sorts of covenant tests including industry diversification and minimum collateral rating. The size of these vehicles ranges from\$ 300 million to a billion; though the rule in 2001 was for deals of 300–600 million.

# Proprietary Investing

Proprietary investing is done mainly by insurance companies who have internal managers. Again, a 500 million commitment of capital is required for a seat at the table.

# Managed Accounts

While managed accounts are used by endowments, insurance companies also use them to dip their toes in the loan market. These accounts can run between 50 million and several hundred million dollars. The investor pays a fee to access a manager's relationship with underwriters and his or her position in the market.

# Total Rate of Return Swaps

Total rate of return swaps are primarily used by hedge funds to invest in loans. These swaps allow the funds to take a leveraged position in the performance of one loan or a basket of loans in exchange for a fee.

# WINNING A MANDATE

Normally, a borrower will solicit several bids from potential agents before awarding a mandate to one or more agents. Potential agents will normally include the borrower's traditional agent, large relationship lenders and, perhaps, other lenders that have expertise in the borrower's industry or segment. Potential agents will propose pricing and structure based on comparables (the most recent credits of similar, or comparable, borrowers), taking into account several driving factors discussed below.


# Borrower Risk

The likelihood that a borrower will be unable to repay the loan on time. It is based on the borrower's financial condition, industry segment and conditions within that industry, economic variables, and intangibles like company management. Borrower Risk will often be determined by a rating from Standard & Poor's Corp. (S&P) or Moody's Investors Service. These ratings range (at close) from AAA for the most creditworthy borrowers to B- for the least. The market is divided, roughly, into two segments: Investment Grade (borrowers rated BBB- or higher by S&P or Baa3 or higher by Moody's) and Leveraged (borrowers rated lower by either agency). Borrower risk varies widely within each of these broad segments. If a borrower rating is not available (either because the company is too small or has no public debt to rate) then financial measures, like revenue size, leverage, and coverage (see the next section for an explanation) are used to determine risk.

# Facility Risk

Facility risk is the potential loss to the bank if the borrower does indeed default. This is based on the collateral (if any) backing the loan and the amount of other debt and equity that are subordinated to the loan.

# Sponsor

If a transaction has a strong sponsor group, agents may be able to offer the borrower more attractive pricing. Many leveraged companies are owned by a group of equity sponsors. These are entities, like Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts (KKR), which invest in many companies that have leveraged capital structures. To the extent the sponsor or sponsor group has a strong following in the syndicated loan market, a loan is easier to syndicate and, therefore, can be priced lower. If the sponsor group does not have a loyal set of relationship lenders, by contrast, the deal may need to be priced higher to attract potential investors.

# Supply/Demand

With respect to supply and demand, two factors are important—deal size and market activity. The size of the deal must be weighed against potential market demand. Clearly, the larger the deal in comparison to market demand, the higher the pricing must be to attract lenders. By contrast, if demand far outstrips the deal size, the pricing can be set tighter. Market activity is similar to the last point. If there are many deals competing for market attention, an agent must make sure that its deal will be compelling by setting pricing higher. If, by contrast, the market is dry, pricing can be set more aggressively.


# TYPES OF SYNDICATED LOAN FACILITY

# Revolving Credit

In a revolving credit (RC), borrowers can draw down, repay, and reborrow. The facility acts much like a credit card, except that borrowers are charged a fee on unused amounts. Many revolvers to leveraged grade borrowers are tied to the Borrowing Base lending formula. This limits borrowing to a certain percentage of collateral, most often receivables and inventory. There a number of options that can be offered within a RC:
- Swingline — A small overnight borrowing line typically provided by the agent.
Multi-Currency—The borrower may have the right to borrow in several currencies.
Competitive Bid Option (CBO)—Allows borrowers to solicit the best bids from its syndicate group. The agent will conduct what amounts to an auction to raise funds for the borrower. The best bids are accepted and used. Typically available to large, investment-grade borrowers.
■ Term-Out—Many RCs allow the borrower to term-out borrowings at a given conversion date. Under the option, borrowers may take what is outstanding under the facility and pay it off on a predetermined repayment schedule.
Evergreen - The option for the borrower with consent of the syndicate group to extend the facility each year for an additional year.

# 364-Day Facility

A 364-day facility is precisely that—a revolving credit that runs 364 days. The reason is that regulatory capital guidelines set a one-year cutoff on whether banks must reserve capital against unused amounts under revolving credits. Therefore, banks offer more attractive undrawn fees (commitment and/or annual fees) on 364-day facilities than on multiyear RCs.

# Term Loan

With a term loan, or installment loan, the borrower may draw down the loan during a set initial commitment period. Then the borrower repays the loan based on a scheduled series of repayments or a one-time payment at maturity (bullet payment). A common example is an auto loan.

# Amortizing Term Loan

An amortizing term loan is a term loan with a progressive repayment schedule that typically run six years or less in term. These loans are normally syndicated to banks along with revolving credits as part of a syndication.

# Institutional Term Loan

Institutional term loans (B/C/D Term Loans) are term loan facilities carved out for nonbank, institutional investors. These loans are priced higher than amortizing term loans because they have longer maturities and back-end loaded repayment schedules. The loans are named in alphabetical order: TLb/c/d.

# Letter of Credit

There are a number of different letters of credit (LC) which, simply put, are guarantees provided by the bank to pay off debt or obligations if the borrower cannot.

# Equipment Lines

Equipment lines provide credit that may be drawn down for a given period to purchase specified assets or equipment. The lines are then repaid over a specified period. Repaid amounts may not be borrowed.

# SYNDICATING A LOAN BY FACILITY

Most loans in the leveraged market comprise a revolving credit, an amortizing term loan (TLa) and several institutional term loan tranches. Most loans are structured and syndicated to accommodate the two primary syndicated lender constituencies: Banks (domestic and foreign) and institutional investors (primarily mutual funds and insurance companies).

Most times, loan facilities are divided into two pieces to appeal to these groups:

■ Pro Rata—This comprises the RC and TLa, which are packaged together and normally syndicated to banks. In some deals, however, institutional investors take pieces of the TLa and, less often, RC.
- Institutional — This comprises institutional term loans. In most deals these facilities are packaged together and sold to institutional investors, though some banks are buyers of institutional term loans.

# SECONDARY SALES

After the loan is syndicated and closed, the lender may sell pieces of their commitment to other lenders. New lenders may buy basically in two ways: assignments and participations.

# Assignments

The assignee becomes a direct signatory to the loan and receives interest and principal payments directly from the administrative agent. Assignments typically require the consent of the borrower and agent. Consent may be withheld only if a reasonable objection is made. The amount of the assignment usually must exceed a certain amount (typically  $5 -$ 10 million) and the assigning bank must pay a fee to the administrative agent (the fee can range broadly but usually is  $2,000 -$ 3,500). This fee also may be less if the assignee is an existing lender that is just increasing its position in the loan.

Traditionally arrangers have waived assignments for their best institutional accounts on secondary trades that they've executed. And since 2001, several league table banks have instituted policies where they would waive fees on trades made away from them—on loans for which they are the administrative agent—if, of course, the dealer that made that particular trade adopted a similar policy. At this writing, in December 2001, five or six of the 25 active dealers had adopted such a policy, so it was not yet a market convention. But, institutional accounts, discussed previously, are gaining increasing power in the market and are exerting a great deal of pressure on the sell side to do away with fees altogether.

# Participations

A participation is an agreement between a lender and a participant. The participant is essentially participating in the lender's loan. The lender remains the official holder of the loan with the participant owning the rights to the amount purchased. Consents, fees, or minimums are almost never required. The participant only has the right to vote on material changes in the loan document (rate, term, and collateral). Non-material changes do not require approval of participants. A participation can be a more risky way of purchasing a loan because if the lender becomes insolvent or defaults, the participant does not have a direct claim on the loan. In this case, the participant become a creditor of the lender and often must wait for claims to be sorted out in order to collect on its participation.


# PRICING

# Rates

Bank loans usually offer borrowers different interest rate options. Several of these options allow borrowers to lock in a given rate for a one-month to one-year period. Pricing on many loans is tied to performance grids, which adjust pricing by one or more financial criteria. Pricing is typically tied to rating in investment-grade loans and financial ratios in leveraged loans. Communications loans are invariably tied to the borrower's debt to cash flow ratio. Pricing options include those described below.

# Prime

This is a floating-rate option. Borrowed funds are priced at a spread over the reference bank's prime lending rate. The rate is reset daily and borrowers may be repaid at any time without penalty. This is typically an overnight option, because the prime option is more costly to the borrower than LIBOR or CDs.

# LIBOR (or Eurodollars)

Interest on borrowings is set at a spread over LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) for a period of one month to one year. The corresponding LIBOR rate is used to set pricing. Borrowings cannot be prepaid before the end of the period unless the borrower receives the consent of banks or reimburses the banks for any potential loss resulting from the prepayment.

# CD

This option works precisely like the LIBOR option except the base rate is certificates of deposit (CDs) sold by a bank to institutional investors.

# Other Fixed-Rate Options

There are a number of other options that are less common but work like the LIBOR and CD options. These include federal funds (the overnight rate charged by the Federal Reserve to member banks) and cost of funds (the bank's own funding rate).


# Fees

There are a number of fees associated with syndicated loans. They are described as follows.

# Upfront Fee

More recently as the market has matured, participants have taken to adopting bond market parlance and referring to this fee as an original issue discount. In any case, it is the fee paid by the borrower to the banks for making the loan. The fee is often tiered, with the agent (or agents) receiving a larger amount in consideration of structuring and/or underwriting the loan, thereby assuming greater risk. Once pricing and structure are set, the agent(s)—often with borrower approval or at least knowledge—will set several fee tiers for the retail market, with lenders making larger commitments and receiving higher fees. Most often, fees are paid on a lender's final allocation. For example, a loan has two fee tiers: 100 basis points (or 1.0\%) for 25 million commitments and 50 basis points for 15 million commitments. A lender committing to the \$25 million tier will be paid on its final allocation rather than on its initial commitment. In this example, the loan is oversubscribed and lenders committing \$25 million are allocated \$20 million; these lenders will receive a fee of \$200,000 (or 1.0\% of 20 million). Sometimes upfront fees will be structured as a percent of final allocation plus a flat fee. This happens most often for larger fee tiers to encourage potential lenders to step up for larger commitments. The flat fee is paid regardless of the lender's final allocation.

# Commitment Fee

A commitment fee, of up to  $0.50\%$  annually, is paid to lenders on undrawn amounts under a revolving credit or a term loan prior to draw down. On term loans, this fee is usually referred to as a "ticking" fee.

# Facility Fee

Facility fees are paid on a facility's entire committed amount, regardless of usage. This fee is often charged on revolving credits to investment-grade borrowers, instead of a commitment fee. The reason: These facilities typically have competitive bid options (CBOs) that allow a borrower to solicit the best bid from its syndicate group for a given borrowing. The lenders that do not lend under the CBO are still paid for their commitment.

# Administrative Agent Fees

The agent is typically paid an annual fee to administer the loan (including distributing interest payments to the syndicated group, updating lender lists and managing borrowings). For secured loans (particularly those backed by receivables and inventory) the agent often collects a collateral monitoring fee, to ensure that the promised collateral is in place.

# Letter of Credit Fees

There are several types of letter of credit fees. The most common—a fee for standby or financial letters of credit—guarantees that lenders will support various corporate activities. Because these LCs are considered borrowed funds under capital guidelines, the fee is typically the same as the LIBOR margin. Fees for commercial LCs (those supporting inventory or trade) are typically lower because actual collateral is submitted). The LC is usually issued by a fronting bank (usually the agent) and syndicated to the lender group on a pro rata basis. The group receives the LC fee on their respective shares, while the fronting bank receives an issuing (or fronting, or facing) fee for issuing and administering the LC. This fee is almost always 12.5–25.0 bps (0.125–0.250\%) of the LC commitment.

# Cancellation/Prepayment Fees

Cancellation/prepayment fees are found only in loans to the most risky borrowers. They are fees paid to banks if the borrower repays early. Most have a sliding scale, so that borrowings prepaid in year one are charged a higher fee, which declines over time. Prepayment fees are often featured on Amortization Extended Loans (Axels), a version of institutional term loans from Goldman Sachs.

# VOTING RIGHTS

Amendments (changes) to a loan agreement must be approved by a certain percentage of lenders. Most loan agreements have three levels of approval:

■ Required Lenders—Typically the percentage of lenders required to approve non-material amendments and waivers. This number is usually a simple majority. In addition, changes affecting one facility within a deal almost always require the approval of a majority of that facility's lenders.
Full Vote—Approval of all lenders (including participants) is required to approve material changes. These are typically RATS rights (Rate, amortization, term, and security/collateral), though, as described below, sometimes changes in amortization and collateral may be approved by a lower percentage of lenders (a supermajority).
- Supermajority — Many loans also have a supermajority voting tier (typically  $67 - 80\%$ ) under which certain material changes can be made. These include changes in amortization (in-term repayments) and release of collateral.

# COVENANTS

Loan agreements have a series of restrictions which dictate, to varying degrees, how borrowers can operate and how they can carry themselves financially. For instance, one covenant may require the borrower to maintain its fiscal-year end. Another may prohibit the borrower from taking on new debt. Most agreements also have financial compliance covenants. For instance, a borrower must keep a certain level of equity; if not, banks have the right to terminate the agreement or push the borrower into default. The size of the covenant package increases in proportion to a borrower's financial risk. Agreements to investment-grade companies are usually thin and easy. Agreements to leveraged borrowers often are much more onerous. There are three primary covenant types that are described next.

# Affirmative Covenants

Affirmative covenants state what the borrower must do to be in compliance with the loan. An example would be that the borrower must maintain insurance. These covenants are usually boiler-plate and require a borrower to pay the bank interest and fees, maintain insurance, pay taxes, and so forth.

# Negative Covenants

Negative covenants limit the borrower's activities. An example would be a limit on new investments. Negative covenants are highly structured and customized to a borrower's specific condition. They can limit the type and amount of investments, new debt, liens, asset sales, acquisitions and guarantees.

# Financial Covenants

Financial covenants enforce minimum financial performance measures on the borrower. For example, the borrower must maintain a higher level of current assets than current liabilities. These covenants become more tightly wound and extensive as a borrower's risk increases. In general, there are five types of financial covenants:
- Coverage—The borrower must maintain a minimum level of cash flow or earnings, relative to specified expenses, most often interest, debt service (interest and repayments), fixed charges (debt service, capital expenditures and/or rent).
Leverage—A maximum level of debt relative to either equity or cash flow. The debt to cash flow level is far more common.
- Current Ratio—The borrower must maintain a minimum ratio of current assets (cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inventories) to current liabilities (accounts payable, short-term debt of less than one year). Sometimes, a Quick Ratio is substituted. The only difference: Inventories are not excluded from the numerate.
Tangible Net Worth (TNW)—Most borrowers are required to have a minimum level of TNW (net worth less intangible assets such as goodwill, intellectual assets, excess value paid for acquired companies). There often is a build-up provision increasing the minimum by a percentage of net income or equity issuance.
Maximum Capital Expenditures—Borrower must limit capital expenditures (purchases of property, plant, and equipment) to a certain amount. The amount may be increased by some percentage of cash flow or equity issuance. Also, the borrower often can carry forward amounts not used in the current year to the next year.

# Mandatory Prepayments

Usually, leveraged loans require a borrower to prepay with proceeds of excess cash flow, asset sales, and debt or equity issuance.

Excess Cash Flow—Typically defined as Cash Flow after all cash expenses, required Dividends, Debt Repayments, Capital Expenditures and changes in Working Capital. Typical percent:  $50 - 75\%$ .
■ Asset Sales—Net proceeds of asset sales, normally excluding receivables or inventories. Typical percent:  $100\%$ .
- Debt Issuance—Net proceeds from debt issuance. Typical percent:  $100\%$ .
Equity Issuance—Net proceeds of equity issuance. Typical percent: 25-50\%.

# CHAPTER 20
