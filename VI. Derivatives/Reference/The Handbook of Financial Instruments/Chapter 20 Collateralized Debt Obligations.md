A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is an asset-backed security backed by a diversified pool of one or more of the following types of debt obligations:

U.S. domestic investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds
U.S. domestic bank loans emerging market bonds
special situation loans and distressed debt foreign bank loans
■ asset-backed securities residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities

When the underlying pool of debt obligations consists of bond-type instruments (corporate and emerging market bonds), a CDO is referred to as a collateralized bond obligation (CBO). When the underlying pool of debt obligations are bank loans, a CDO is referred to as a collateralized loan obligation (CLO).

In this chapter we explain the basic CDO structure, the types of CDOs, the risks associated with investing in CDOs, and the general principles for creating a portfolio of CDOs.

# STRUCTURE OF A CDO

In a CDO structure, there is an asset manager responsible for managing the portfolio. There are restrictions imposed (i.e., restrictive covenants) as to what the asset manager may do and certain tests that must be satisfied for the CDO securities to maintain the credit rating assigned at the time of issuance. We'll discuss some of these requirements later.

The funds to purchase the underlying assets (i.e., the bonds and loans) are obtained from the issuance of debt obligations. These debt obligations are referred to as tranches. The tranches are:

■ senior tranches mezzanine tranches
subordinate/equity tranche

There will be a rating sought for all but the subordinate/equity tranche. For the senior tranches, at least an A rating is typically sought. For the mezzanine tranches, a rating of BBB but no less than B is sought. Since the subordinate/equity tranche receives the residual cash flow, no rating is sought for this tranche.

The ability of the asset manager to make the interest payments to the tranches and pay off the tranches as they mature depends on the performance of the underlying assets. The proceeds to meet the obligations to the CDO tranches (interest and principal repayment) can come from

■ coupon interest payments from the underlying assets maturing assets in the underlying pool
sale of assets in the underlying pool

In a typical structure, one or more of the tranches is a floating-rate security. With the exception of deals backed by bank loans that pay a floating rate, the asset manager invests in fixed-rate bonds. Now that presents a problem—paying tranche investors a floating rate and investing in assets with a fixed rate. To deal with this problem, the asset manager uses derivative instruments to be able to convert a portion of the fixed-rate payments from the assets into floating-rate cash flow to pay floating-rate tranches. In particular, interest rate swaps are used. This instrument allows a market participant to swap fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments or vice versa. Because of the mismatch between the nature of the cash flows of the assets in which the manager invests and the floating-rate liability of any of the tranches, the asset manager must use an interest rate swap. A rating agency will require the use of swaps to eliminate this mismatch.


# Arbitrage versus Balance Sheet Transactions

CDOs are categorized based on the motivation of the sponsor of the transaction. If the motivation of the sponsor is to earn the spread between the yield offered on the assets in the underlying pool and the payments made to the various tranches in the structure, then the transaction is referred to as an arbitrage transaction. If the motivation of the sponsor is to remove debt instruments (primarily loans) from its balance sheet, then the transaction is referred to as a balance sheet transaction. Sponsors of balance sheet transactions are typically financial institutions such as banks seeking to reduce their capital requirements by removing loans due to their higher risk-based capital requirements. Our focus in this chapter is on arbitrage transactions.

# ARBITRAGE TRANSACTIONS

The key as to whether it is economically feasible to create an arbitrage CDO is whether a structure can offer a competitive return for the subordinate/equity tranche.

To understand how the subordinate/equity tranche generates cash flows, consider the following basic 100 million CDO structure with the coupon rate to be offered at the time of issuance as follows:

<table><tr><td>Tranche</td><td>Par value</td><td>Coupon type</td><td>Coupon rate</td></tr><tr><td>Senior</td><td>80,000,000</td><td>Floating</td><td>LIBOR + 70 basis points</td></tr><tr><td>Mezzanine</td><td>10,000,000</td><td>Fixed</td><td>Treasury rate + 200 basis points</td></tr><tr><td>Subordinate/Equity</td><td>10,000,000</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr></table>

Suppose that the collateral consists of bonds that all mature in 10 years and the coupon rate for every bond is the 10-year Treasury rate plus 400 basis points. The asset manager enters into an interest rate swap agreement with another party with a notional principal of 80 million in which it agrees to do the following:

Pay a fixed rate each year equal to the 10-year Treasury rate plus 100 basis points
Receive LIBOR

The interest rate agreement is simply an agreement to periodically exchange interest payments. The payments are benchmarked off a notional principal. This amount is not exchanged between the two parties. Rather it is used simply to determine the dollar interest payment of each party. This is all we need to know about an interest rate swap in order to understand the economics of an arbitrage CDO transaction. Keep in mind, the goal is to show how the subordinate/equity tranche can be expected to generate a return.

Let's assume that the 10-year Treasury rate at the time the CDO is issued is  $7\%$ . Now we can walk through the cash flows for each year. Look first at the collateral. The collateral will pay interest each year (assuming no defaults) equal to the 10-year Treasury rate of  $7\%$  plus 400 basis points. So the interest will be:

$$
\text {I n t e r s t f r o m c o l l a t e r a l :} 1 1
$$

Now let's determine the interest that must be paid to the senior and mezzanine tranches. For the senior tranche, the interest payment will be:

$$
\text {I n t e r s t} = \text {s e n i o r} = 8 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 \times (\mathrm {L I B O R} + 7 0 \mathrm {b p})
$$

The coupon rate for the mezzanine tranche is  $7\%$  plus 200 basis points. So, the coupon rate is  $9\%$  and the interest is:

$$
\text {I n t e r s t t o m e z z a n i n e t r a n c h e :} 9 \% \times \ 10,000,000 = \$ 900,000
$$

Finally, let's look at the interest rate swap. In this agreement, the asset manager is agreeing to pay some third party (we'll call this party the "swap counterparty") 7\% each year (the 10-year Treasury rate) plus 100 basis points, or 8\%. But 8\% of what? As explained above, in an interest rate swap payments are based on a notional principal. In our illustration, the notional principal is \$80 million. The asset manager selected the \$80 million because this is the amount of principal for the senior tranche. So, the asset manager pays to the swap counterparty:

$$
\text{Interest to swap counterparty:} 8 \% \times \ 80,000,000 = \ 6,400,000
$$

The interest payment received from the swap counterparty is LIBOR based on a notional amount of 80 million. That is,

Interest from swap counterparty: 80,000,000 × LIBOR

Now we can put this all together. Let's look at the interest coming into the CDO:

Interest from collateral = 11,000,000

Interest from swap counterparty = 80,000,000 × LIBOR

Total interest received = $11,000,000 + $80,000,000 × LIBOR

The interest to be paid out to the senior and mezzanine tranches and to the swap counterparty include:

Interest to senior tranche = 80,000,000 × (LIBOR + 70 bp)

Interest to mezzanine tranche = 900,000

Interest to swap counterparty = 6,400,000

Total interest paid = $7,300,000 + $80,000,000 × (LIBOR + 70bp)

Netting the interest payments coming in and going out we have:

Total interest received = $11,000,000 + $80,000,000 × LIBOR

-Total interest paid = \ 7,300,000 + \$ 80,000,000 \times (\text{LIBOR} + 70\text{bp})

Net interest =  $\overline{3,700,000 - 80,000,000 \times (70\mathrm{bp})}$

Since 70 bp times \$80 million is \$560,000, the net interest remaining is $3,140,000 (= $3,700,000 - \$560,000). From this amount any fees (including the asset management fee) must be paid. The balance is then the amount available to pay the subordinate/equity tranche. Suppose that these fees are \$614,000. Then the cash flow available to the subordinate/equity tranche is \$2.5 million. Since the tranche has a par value of \$10 million and is assumed to be sold at par, this means that the potential return is 25\%.

Obviously, some simplifying assumptions have been made. For example, it is assumed that there are no defaults. It is assumed that all of the issues purchased by the asset manager are noncallable (or not prepayable) and therefore the coupon rate would not decline because issues are called. Moreover, as explained later, after some period the asset manager must begin repaying principal to the senior and mezzanine tranches. Consequently, the interest swap must be structured to take this into account since the entire amount of the senior tranche is not outstanding for the life of the collateral. Despite these simplifying assumptions, the illustration does demonstrate the basic economics of the CDO, the need for the use of an interest rate swap, and how the subordinate/equity tranche will realize a return.

# Early Termination

A deal can be terminated early if certain events of default occur. These events basically relate to conditions that are established that would materially adversely impact the performance of the underlying assets. Such events include (1) the failure to comply with certain covenants, (2) failure to meet payments (interest and/or principal) to the senior tranches, (3) bankruptcy of the issuing entity of the CDO, and (4) departure of the portfolio management team if an acceptable replacement is not found.

# Types of Arbitrage Transactions

Arbitrage transactions can be divided into two types depending on what the primary source of the proceeds from the underlying assets are to satisfy the obligation to the tranches. If the primary source is the interest and maturing principal from the underlying assets, then the transaction is referred to as a cash flow transaction. If instead the proceeds to meet the obligations depend heavily on the total return generated from the portfolio (i.e., interest income, capital gain, and maturing principal), then the transaction is referred to as a market value transaction.

# CASH FLOW TRANSACTIONS

In a cash flow transaction, the objective of the asset manager is to generate cash flow for the senior and mezzanine tranches without the need to actively trade bonds. Because the cash flows from the structure are designed to accomplish the objective for each tranche, restrictions are imposed on the asset manager. The asset manager is not free to buy and sell bonds. The conditions for disposing of issues held are specified and are usually driven by credit risk considerations. Also, in assembling the portfolio, the asset manager must meet certain requirements set forth by the rating agency or agencies that rate the transaction.

There are three relevant periods. The first is the ramp-up period. This is the period that follows the closing date of the transaction where the asset manager begins investing the proceeds from the sale of the debt obligations issued. This period usually lasts from 1 to 2 years. The reinvestment period or revolving period is where principal proceeds are reinvested and is usually for 5 or more years. In the final period, the portfolio assets are sold and the debtholders are paid off as described as follows.

# Distribution of Income

Income is derived from interest income from the underlying assets and capital appreciation. The income is then used as follows. Payments are first made to the trustee and administrators and then to the senior asset manager. Once these fees are paid, then the senior tranches are paid their interest. At this point, before any other payments are made, certain tests must be passed. These tests are called coverage tests and are discussed later. If the coverage tests are passed, then interest is paid to the mezzanine tranches. Once the mezzanine tranches are paid, interest is paid to the subordinate/equity tranche.


In contrast, if the coverage tests are not passed, then payments are made to protect the senior tranches. The remaining income after paying the fees and senior tranche interest is used to redeem the senior tranches (i.e., pay off principal) until the coverage tests are brought into compliance. If the senior tranches are paid off fully because the coverage tests are not brought into compliance, then any remaining income is used to redeem the mezzanine tranches. Any remaining income is then used to redeem the subordinate/equity tranche.

# Distribution of Principal Cash Flow

The principal cash flow is distributed as follows after the payment of the fees to the trustees, administrators, and senior managers. If there is a shortfall in interest paid to the senior tranches, principal proceeds are used to make up the shortfall. Assuming that the coverage tests are satisfied, during the reinvestment period the principal is reinvested. After the reinvestment period or if the coverage tests are failed, the principal cash flow is used to pay down the senior tranches until the coverage tests are satisfied. If all the senior tranches are paid down, then the mezzanine tranches are paid off and then the subordinate/equity tranche is paid off.

After all the debt obligations are satisfied in full and if permissible, the subordinate/equity investors are paid. Typically, there are also incentive fees paid to management based on performance. Usually, a target return for the subordinate/equity investors is established at the inception of the transaction. Management is then permitted to share on some pro rata basis once the target return is achieved. Later when we explain how to assess a CDO, we will see that the incentive fee structure is an important factor.

# Restrictions on Management

The asset manager must monitor the collateral to ensure that certain tests are being met. There are two types of tests imposed by rating agencies: quality tests and coverage tests.

# Quality Tests

In rating a transaction, the rating agencies are concerned with the diversity of the assets. Consequently, there are tests that relate to the diver sity of the assets. These tests are called quality tests. An asset manager may not undertake a trade that will result in the violation of any of the quality tests. Quality tests include


a minimum asset diversity score a minimum weighted average rating
maturity restrictions
■ restrictions imposed on the concentration of bonds in certain countries or geographical regions for collateral consisting of emerging market bonds

Diversity Score An asset diversity score is a measure that is constructed to gauge the diversity of the collateral's assets. Moody's has developed a measure. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to discuss this measure and the theory underlying its construction. Rather, what is important to understand is that every time the composition of the portfolio changes, a diversity score is computed. There is a minimum diversity score needed to achieve a particular rating.

Weighted Average Rating A measure is also needed to gauge the credit quality of the collateral's assets. Certainly one can describe the distribution of the credit ratings of a portfolio in terms of the percentage of the collateral's assets in each credit rating. However, such a measure would be of limited use in establishing tests for a minimum credit rating for the portfolio. There is a need to have one figure that summarizes the rating distribution.

Moody's and Fitch have developed a measure to summarize the rating distribution. This measure is commonly referred to as the weighted average rating factor (WARF) for the collateral's assets. This involves assigning a numerical value to each rating. These numerical values are referred to as "rating factors." For example, Moody's assigns a rating factor of 1 for Aaa rated issues scaling up to 10,000 for Ca rated issues. For each issue in the collateral portfolio, the current face value of the issue is multiplied by its corresponding rating factor. The values are then summed to give the WARF and a WARF value would then correspond to a rating for the collateral portfolio. The asset manager must maintain a minimum average rating score.

Unlike Moody's and Fitch, S&P uses a different system. S&P specifies required rating percentages that the collateral portfolio must maintain. Specifically, S&P requires strict percentage limits for lower rated assets in the portfolio.

# Coverage Tests

There are tests to ensure that the performance of the collateral is sufficient to make payments to the various tranches. These tests are called coverage tests. There are two types of coverage tests: par value tests and interest coverage tests. Recall that if the coverage tests are violated, then income from the collateral is diverted to pay down the senior tranches.


Par value test A separate par value test is used for each rated bond issued in the transaction. A par value test specifies that the par value of the collateral's portfolio be at least a specified percentage above the liability to the bondholders. For example, suppose that the par value of the senior notes in a CDO deal is  \$50 million. The par value test might specify that the collateral's par value must be 120\%$  of the par value of the senior notes. That is, the par value of the collateral must be at least 60 million (\$50 million times  $120\%$ ). Basically, this is an overcollateralization test for a rated bond issued since it is a measure of the cushion provided by the collateral's assets over the obligation to the bondholders in terms of par value.

The percentage in the par value test is called the trigger, and as indicated, the trigger is different for each rated bond. Specifically, the trigger declines as the rating declines. For example, if the trigger for the senior tranches is  $120\%$ , then the trigger will be less than  $120\%$  for the mezzanine tranches. This simply means that the overcollateralization in terms of par value declines as the rating of a bond issued in the transaction declines.

Interest coverage test While par value tests focus on the market value of the collateral relative to the par value of the bonds issued, interest coverage tests look at the ability to meet interest payments when due.

# MARKET VALUE TRANSACTIONS

Cash flow transactions are dependent on the ability of the collateral to generate sufficient current cash flow to pay interest and principal on the rated tranches issued by the CDO. The ratings are based on the effect of collateral defaults and recoveries on the receipt of timely interest and principal payments from the collateral. The asset manager focuses on controlling defaults and recoveries. Overcollateralization, in terms of par value of the collateral's assets, provides important structural protection for bondholders. If par value (overcollateralization) tests are not met, then cash flow is diverted from the mezzanine and subordinated tranches to pay down senior notes, or cash flow is trapped in a reserve account. There are no forced collateral liquidations.

In contrast, market value transactions depend upon the ability of the asset manager to maintain and improve the market value of the collateral. Funds to be used for liability principal payments are obtained from liquidating the collateral. Liability interest payments can be made from collateral interest receipts, as well as collateral liquidation proceeds. Ratings are based on collateral price volatility, liquidity, and market value. The asset manager focuses on maximizing total return while minimizing volatility.


Overcollateralization tests are conducted regularly. However, in market value transactions, the overcollateralization tests are based on the market value of the collateral portfolio, not the par value. Market value overcollateralization tests require that the market value of assets multiplied by the "advance rates" (discussed later) be greater than or equal to debt outstanding. If that is not the case, collateral sales and liability redemptions may be required to bring overcollateralization ratios back into compliance.[2] As with cash value transactions, market value transactions do have diversity, concentration, and other portfolio constraints, albeit less than cash flow transactions. Exhibit 20.1 summarizes the salient features of cash flow versus market value transactions.

Why are market value structures used? While market value deals are a distinct minority of CBOs, they are the structure of choice for certain types of collateral (such as distressed debt), where the cash flows are not predictable with a reasonable degree of certainty. It is very difficult to use unpredictable cash flows within the confines of a cash flow structure. Moreover, market value structures may also appeal to asset managers and equity buyers who like the greater trading flexibility inherent in these deals. Finally, market value transactions also facilitate the purchase of assets that mature beyond the life of the transaction, because the price volatility associated with the forced sale of these assets is explicitly considered.

Let's illustrate the structure with the hypothetical transaction shown in Exhibit 20.2. The first column of the exhibit shows the capital structure of the transaction. The capital structure includes a senior facility, senior notes, senior-mezzanine notes, subordinate notes, and equity. The senior facility is a floating-rate revolving loan. This structure has a subordinated tranche as well as an equity tranche. The second column shows the capital structure at the closing date.

During the ramp-up period, the asset manager obtains additional funding based on the target leverage. The additional leverage is provided from the senior borrowing facility and additional amount provided by senior notes. Additional equity is also injected. The last column shows the capital structure when the transaction is fully ramped up.

* Advance rate: percentage of the market value of a particular asset that may be issued as rated debt. Advance rates depend upon the price volatility and quality of price/return data and the liquidity of the assets. Assets with lower price volatility and greater liquidity are typically assigned higher advance rates.

EXHIBIT 20.2 Illustration of a Hypothetical Market Value Transaction (in millions of dollars)

<table><tr><td>Capital Structure</td><td>At Closing Date</td><td>Fully Ramped Up</td></tr><tr><td>Senior facility</td><td>$0</td><td>$364</td></tr><tr><td>Senior note</td><td>40</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>Senior-subordinated notes</td><td>80</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Subordinated notes</td><td>40</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Equity</td><td>8</td><td>160</td></tr></table>

The order of priority of the principal payments in the capital structure is as follows. Fees are paid first for trustees, administrators, and managers. After these fees are paid, the senior facility and the senior notes are paid. The two classes in the capital structure are treated pari passu (i.e., equal in their rights to their claim on cash proceeds from the underlying assets). That is, their payments are pro rated if there is a shortfall. If the senior facility or senior notes are amortizing, they would have the next priority on the cash proceeds from the underlying assets with respect to the payment of the principal due. The senior-subordinated notes would be paid, followed by the subordinated notes. All of this assumes that the overcollateralization tests are satisfied. If not, the senior notes are then paid down until the overcollateralization tests are brought into compliance.

# The Rating Process

The credit enhancement for a market value deal is the cushion between the current market value of the collateral and the face value of the structure's obligations. Within this framework, the collateral must normally be liquidated (either in whole or in part) if the ratio of the market value of the collateral to the debt obligations falls below a predetermined threshold. The liquidated collateral is used to pay down debt obligations, which brings the structure back into compliance.

The biggest risk in a market value transaction is a sudden decline in the value of the collateral pool. Thus, the rating agencies focus on the price volatility and liquidity of the assets that may be incorporated into these structures. Volatility and liquidity are assumed to be reflected in a set of advance rates that are designed to provide a cushion against market risk, and represent adjustments to the value of each asset.

A market value deal simply requires that the market value of the collateral times the advance rate (the adjustment to the value of the assets to provide a cushion against market risk) be greater than the book value of the liabilities. Moody's and Fitch, the rating agencies that have rated the majority of market value deals thus far, both use a set of advance rates to determine how much rated debt can be issued against the market value of an asset.

To get a handle on what this all means, Exhibit 20.3 shows Moody's advance rates in the simplest case of a one-tranche structure—one with subordination provided only by the advance rate. In producing the advance rates shown in Exhibit 20.3, Moody's assumed the following regarding portfolio diversification:

1. Maximum allowable investment in one issuer  $= 5\%$
2. Maximum allowable investment in any one industry  $= 20\%$
3. Maximum allowable investment in any one asset type  $= 100\%$

Thus, the least diversified portfolio consists of 20 issuers, 5 industries, and one asset type.

If an asset class consists of performing high-yield bonds rated B, and the deal is carved only into a bond rated A2 and equity, then (from Exhibit 20.3) Moody's advance rate would be 0.79. Thus, the market value of the deal times the advance rate (0.79 in this case) must be greater than the market value of the bonds. If a deal has several tranches, then the par value of the debt within each rating is weighted to find the weighted average advance rate. Thus, if the liabilities consisted of equal parts of bonds rated A2 (with an advance rate of 0.79) and those rated Baa2 (with an advance rate of 0.83), then the weighted average advance rate would be 0.81. Note that if there were greater diversification within this deal, then the advance rates would be somewhat higher.

In addition to the protection provided by advance rates, Fitch also has a required quarterly minimum net worth test to protect the rated debt. This requires that  $60\%$  of the original equity remains to protect the senior tranche, and  $30\%$  to protect the subordinated tranche. If the equity falls below that, noteholders of the senior tranche may vote to accelerate payment of the debt, at which point the asset manager must liquidate assets and fully pay down the debt related to the test that has failed.

Advance rates are the crucial variable in market value deals. Advance rates determined by the rating agencies are actually a combination of three factors—price volatility of the securities, correlation among securities, and liquidity.

Many CBO investors have tended to steer away from the debt in market value deals, believing that purchasing the debt is like making an investment in a hedge fund. As a result, market value deals trade at similar or slightly wider spreads than cash flow deals launched at the same time. However, the protections built into market value deals are quite powerful from the bondholder's point of view, and that this paper will eventually trade tighter than paper from cash flow deals with the same rating issued at the same time. Investors should regard the rated bonds in market value deals (offered at similar or slightly wider spreads than equivalently rated bonds in cash flow deals) as a buying opportunity.

# SYNTHETIC CDOS

A synthetic CDO is so named because the CDO does not actually own the pool of assets on which it has the risk. Stated differently, a synthetic CDO absorbs the economic risks, but not the legal ownership, of its reference credit exposures. Synthetic CDO structures are now widely used in both arbitrage and balance sheet transactions.

The building block for synthetic securitizations is a credit derivative.3 More specifically, it a credit default swap, which allows institutions to transfer the economic risk, but not the legal ownership, of underlying assets. A credit default swap is conceptually similar to an insurance policy. A protection buyer (generally the CDO's asset manager) purchases protection against default risk on a reference pool of assets. Those assets can consist of any combination of loans, bonds, derivatives, or receivables. The protection buyer pays a periodic fee (like an insurance premium) and receives, in return, payment from the protection seller (the CDO investors) in the event of a "credit event" affecting any item in the reference pool.

Credit events on a debt instrument generally include: bankruptcy or failure to pay when due, cross default/cross acceleration, repudiation, and restructuring. The bottom line is that the CDO and its investors receive a periodic fee (for accepting the economic risks on the reference pool), and the CDO pays out to the asset manager in the event a defined "credit event" occurs on those reference assets. In the event a credit event occurs, there is an intent that the protection buyer be made whole: The protection buyer should be paid the difference between par and the "fair value" of the securities.

What is the motivation for the creation of synthetic CDOs? By embedding a credit default swap within a CDO structure, financial institutions can shed the economic risk of assets without having to notify any borrowers, or worse, seek borrowers' consent to put their loans into "other hands." In traditional balance sheet collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), transfer of a loan to any special purpose vehicle (SPV) requires at least customer notification, and often customer consent. Thus synthetic

CDOs were initially set up to accommodate European bank balance sheet deals, as it is considered particularly bad form and poor customer relationship management on that continent to sell customer loans.

From an investor's perspective, the concern with synthetic CDOs has been the downgrading of some of the earlier deals. The downgrading reflected the concerns of the rating agencies with respect to the composition of reference pools. Current deals build in substantially better investor protection than was the case in early synthetic CDOs. This improved protection centers on two basic areas: narrowing the definition of credit events in the credit default swap and improving pool disclosure.

# MANAGING A CDO PORTFOLIO

Portfolio managers have accumulated positions in a number of CDOs. Some even have quite an extensive collection, with positions in more than 100 different CDO deals. Yet most portfolio managers tend to look at buying each additional CDO as if they were buying their first. In doing that, they spend a disproportionate amount of time trying to evaluate the manager, and often end up trying to differentiate on the basis of track records.

Although one should look at individual deals, it is crucial to look at the incentive structure in a CDO. Performance of existing CDOs provides much more information than do track records of CDO managers. Moreover, it is of utmost import to manage a portfolio of CDOs within general portfolio framework and parameters.

The key to diversification in CDOs comes from holding different types of collateral. A CDO with a low diversity score may actually increase the diversity of a portfolio, depending on its contents. Style (or asset class) is the most important factor in explaining investment returns.

# General Rules For CDO Portfolio Management

Here are four general rules for CDO portfolio management:

Rule 1. In picking managers, track records cannot be taken at face value. Common sense goes a long way.

Rule 2. Look at the incentive structure for a manager. If possible, see how strong an impact that has had in outstanding deals.

Rule 3. Collect CDOs backed by different types of collateral. Asset class is a far more important determinant of returns than is choice of specific managers. Buy a certain type of CDO when you believe the underlying collateral is cheap.

Rule 4. Look at diversity on a portfolio basis. Buying a number of CDOs, backed by different types of collateral, creates your own diversification. So don't necessarily avoid CDOs with low diversity scores.

We discuss the reasoning behind each of these rules below.

# Track Records

When marketing a CDO deal, the first words spoken to the investor are often "The most important aspect of picking a CDO is selecting a manager; so look at the track record of this manager." But we believe it is very difficult for investors to assess a manager on track records alone, as they do not necessarily allow easy comparison. The best one can hope to establish is that a manager has been managing that particular asset class for a long period of time, their investment approach can be articulated clearly, and risk management parameters are strictly adhered to.

There is good reason to be very skeptical about track records. They contain three biases—"creation bias," "survivorship bias," and "size bias." A discussion of these biases are beyond the scope of this chapter. It should be noted, however, that there is a good deal of academic literature on these biases as they pertain to the equity mutual fund arena. The same biases apply to fixed income funds, as well.

# Common Sense

Rule 1 states that the key to evaluating manager performance is to use common sense. Don't be duped by performance numbers. Here is what to look for:

Make sure the firm has a track record with every asset class it is including, and that the asset manager is not stretching into asset classes in which they have not historically been active.
Make sure the firm has a disciplined, consistent approach to investing, which is followed in good times and bad.
- Look at the stability of both the firm and the manager. A management team that has been at a firm for a long period of time, with significant equity, is less likely to leave. (Ideally, CDO investors would like to handcuff managers to the firm for the life of their deal. One obviously can't do that, but bigger manager stakes mean there's less likelihood of leaving.) Moreover, the longer a group of people has been working together, the less chance of a sudden shift in strategy.

There is an assumption on the part of investors that Wall Street dealers who underwrite CDOs act as gatekeepers, allowing only the top-notch performing managers to pass through their pearly gates. That blind trust is to some extent misplaced. More money management firms wish to manage CDOs than there is dealer pipeline capacity. Thus, a dealer wants to underwrite CDOs (from managers) they believe will sell quickly.

However there are often other considerations, including overall quality of the relationship between the dealer and an asset manager, as well as help the asset manager can provide in marketing the deal and taking some of the equity. Consider two asset managers; one has a very good track record, the other only an average one. The manager with the average track record will take all the equity in the CDOs, plus some of the subordinate securities. The manager with the better track record wants the underwriters to market all the equity. Who will the underwriters pick? It's a no brainer—the manager with the average track record who is willing to provide more help in underwriting the deal.

Realize that the Wall Street dealer community does require at least a minimum performance threshold. The manager's investment philosophy and track record do have to be good enough to market the deal. Moreover, since dealers are looking at the overall quality of the relationship between the dealer and asset manager, as well as an asset manager's willingness to take down some of the equity, it's natural that larger, better established money management firms are likely to have an edge. This is a good thing for investors, per our common sense tests above.

# Checking Out the Incentive Structures in Existing CDO Deals

One of the most important pieces of analysis in evaluating a new CDO deal is to look at how managers have responded to incentive structures on their outstanding deals. In most deals, the deal manager owns between  $25\%$  and  $49.5\%$  of the equity. (If they owned  $50\%$  or more, the entire deal would get consolidated onto their balance sheet.) We believe that in a CDO structure, a deal manager usually has a powerful incentive to keep cash flow going to the equity tranche, even if that works to the detriment of bondholders and net asset value of the deal.

Recall that cutting off cash flows to the equity tranche due to violation of coverage tests generally cuts seriously into equity holders' return. Once equity holders lose the cash flows, it is difficult to get them back later on, since the deal begins to de-lever. Thus, when the manager is also the equity holder, he has every incentive to avoid tripping the overcollateralization and interest coverage tests. Let's look at how this can be done.

Asset managers are often able to forestall violation of coverage tests by judicious portfolio trading. If the overcollateralization test is close to being tripped, selling a bond trading at par, and buying two bonds priced at 50, can temporarily boost the overcollateralization test. Additionally, sometimes if a bond is priced at 75 on the way to 40, it might also be kept in the pool. Moody's acknowledged this problem in a Special Report where it stated:


We have noted some managers that are lax in righting a deteriorating portfolio, while concurrently distributing excess interest out of the structure. These collateral managers do not actively utilize the O/C test at a possible corrective lever that can efficiently be used to remedy a deteriorating deal. Some common examples include cases where a collateral manager is tardy at treating a security as a defaulted securities, buying deep discounted securities, or holding on to severely impaired securities.

It is very difficult for an equity holder to manage a deal and totally ignore their own incentive interests. However, some managers can be egregiously self-serving. This can usually be spotted by looking for a huge deterioration in WARF scores or a big growth in the allocation to assets that fall into the CCC rated bucket.

Realize that poor performance on previous deals is not necessarily indicative of abusive management. Often, market conditions have deteriorated, and most CDOs of that asset type have been impacted. Thus, if a deal is performing poorly, it is very important to look at the reasons why.

# Diversification

Thus far, we have examined what to focus on when looking at an individual deal—making the case that rather than focusing on the manager's track record, focus on the performance of outstanding CDO deals, and how the manager has balanced his or her interests with those of the noteholders. We now shift gears, and argue that not only should CDO buyers look at individual deals, but they should look at their CDO holding in a portfolio framework.

The key to managing a CDO portfolio is diversification. One of the few indisputable facts is that the types of securities purchased (the style) is key—far more important than skills of a particular manager. Roger Ibbotson, one of the key researchers in the performance area, writes: relying on past performance is not as simple as it appears. The investment styles of mutual funds typically explain more than 90 percent of the variation in returns. Just knowing that a fund is a large or small capitalization fund, a growth or value fund, an inter-


national stock fund, or a combination of these categories largely explains its performance. The skill of the manager is demonstrated relative to the fund's investment style. . .

While it is indisputable that style matters, there is a question as to whether good or poor performance in one period is indicative of the performance going forward. That is, are some managers just far superior to others? While there have been studies of mutual funds that have examined this issue, in short, the debate seems to be whether style (asset class) accounts for  $90\%$  or  $99\%$  of return variation. There is no disputing the fact that it is the key factor. Bottom line—diversify across asset classes.

Many investors buying a large number of positions still tend to look at each purchase individually. Yes, it is important to look at each deal, but some parameters may be unacceptable if a particular deal was the only one purchased, and less important when the security will become part of a portfolio. Diversity is one such parameter.

In fact, it is important to look at holdings on a consolidated basis. Adding deals with low diversification may, in some circumstances, help a CDO portfolio. For example, a REIT-only deal may have a low diversity score, but if it is part of a larger CDO portfolio, and REIT holdings elsewhere are limited, then the purchase may actually increase diversification. By contrast, if one purchased three high-yield deals within a short period of time, each with very high diversity scores, the additional diversification provided by buying all three deals may actually be limited, as they may own substantially the same securities. The rating agencies generally tend to require less subordination on a deal with a higher diversity score. However, when an investor purchases a large number of CDOs, they are creating their own diversification.

In point of fact, favoring deals with low diversity scores actually conflicts with the Rule 3—trying to collect CDOs backed by different types of collateral. High-yield and investment-grade corporate deals tend to have much higher diversity scores than do ABS or CBO deals backed by CDO collateral deals. Thus, if one was trying to accumulate deals with low diversity scores, you would be accumulating predominately ABS deals and not achieving that desired diversification.

Thus, the practical advice is

1. an investor should not shun low diversity score deals since the investor also creates his or her own diversification; and
2. an investor should look at holdings in his or her CDO portfolio on a consolidated basis.
