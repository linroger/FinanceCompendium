The rapid formation and widespread use of defined-contribution pension plans in the United States over the last 15 to 25 years has significantly impacted the U.S. financial markets. The key feature of all of these plans that has profoundly impacted investment management trends has been the shift in responsibility for investment decision-making from plan sponsors to individual plan participants. For conservative participants whose primary investment objective is preservation of capital, stable-value investments have been widely used in both the corporate and public plan sectors due their attractive yields, stability, and safety.

A stable-value investment is an instrument in which contractual terms provide for a guaranteed return of principal at specified rate of interest. Examples of stable-value assets include fixed annuities and traditional guaranteed investment contracts (GICS), bank investment contracts (BICs), and GIC alternatives such as separate-account GICs and synthetic GICs. Stable-value pooled funds, which are professionally managed collective trusts investing in these assets, are also utilized. Growth in stable-value assets has paralleled that of the overall defined-contribution market, rising to over \$225 billion by December 2001.

A key feature of a stable-value asset is its treatment from an accounting standpoint. According to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), stable-value instruments can be held at contract value, provided that established criteria are met. Contract value is the acquisition cost of the contract plus accrued interest, adjusted to reflect any additional deposits or withdrawals. This is also referred to as book value. Book-value accounting eliminates the market-value fluctuations experienced by other asset classes and contributes to the high, risk-adjusted returns of stable-value instruments.

Initially, traditional GICs were the dominant stable-value instrument. This was true of the corporate market initially and remains the case for a majority of the public fund plans. The perceived risk in these products was minimal and they faced little, if any, competition until the insolvency of several major GIC issuers. While these defaults proved to be a great challenge to an industry unaccustomed to such difficulties, they also proved to be the catalyst for tremendous change resulting in the development of a new generation of products, popularly known as synthetic GICs. Investors, and ultimately plan participants, now benefit from a broader variety of products, providers, and strategies.

This chapter will review the various instruments utilized in today's stable-value portfolios with an emphasis on GIC alternatives, the most rapidly growing segment of the market. Also discussed are contract terms and portfolio management considerations along with some thoughts on the future direction of the stable-value asset class.

# STABLE-VALUE PRODUCTS

Stable-value products include investment contracts (GICs and BICs), GIC alternatives, separat account GICs, synthetic GICs, buy-and-hold synthetics, actively-managed synthetics, alpha synthetics, and stable-value pooled funds.

# Investment Contracts

Traditional guaranteed investment contracts (also called guaranteed insurance, interest, or income contracts) were the foundation of today's stable-value industry. A GIC is issued by an insurance company, utilizing a group annuity contract format. As insurance contracts, the obligation is backed by the general account of the issuer. In an effort to diversify its depositor base and obtain funding at attractive rates, the banking industry began issuing competing bank investment contracts (BICs) in 1987. While providing stable-value portfolios with industry diversification, BICs achieved only modest market share as a limited number of issuers constrained supply.


While different in legal structure and regulatory purview, GICs and BICs are functionally similar in that the issuer of the contract receives a deposit of funds from a qualified investor and, in return, guarantees a specified rate of interest for a predetermined period of time. Interest is accrued on either a simple interest or a fully compounded basis and paid either annually or at the end of the contract term. The contracts include a variety of terms (discussed later), the most important of which is a guarantee that payments will be made at the contract's book value for qualified participant withdrawals. This feature allows these contracts to be valued at their book value rather than at some calculated market value equivalent.

While traditional GICs still play an important role in most stable-value portfolios, diversification considerations relative to life insurance industry exposure have led to their diminishing use vis-à-vis GIC alternatives. Although some portfolios have significant investments in traditional GICs, more often these products are evaluated versus other investment alternatives and purchased on the basis of their relative value—similar to corporate bonds in a marketable bond portfolio.

# GIC Alternatives

Designed to preserve the benefits of traditional GICs while providing added portfolio diversification and investor control, GIC alternatives now account for a significant and increasing amount of the stable-value marketplace. The two primary forms of alternatives are separate-account GICs offered through life insurance companies and synthetic contracts issued by insurance companies, banks, and other financial institutions.

# Separate-Account GICs

Separate-account GICs are the closest cousins to traditional GICs in that they are contractually issued as a group annuity policy with terms negotiated between the parties. However, unlike a GIC—which is backed by the general assets of the issuer—in a separate account, the insurance company segregates the assets on its balance sheet for the exclusive benefit of the contract holder. Legal ownership remains with the insurance company, but the contract holder's beneficial interest in the securities has been clearly established in most states. Therefore, in the event of an insolvency, the assets are not subject to claims of general policy holders.

The separate-account assets may be managed by the insurance company or, in some cases, by an outside money manager selected by the contract holder with the approval of the insurance company. An initial crediting rate of interest is established which reflects the yield of the underlying securities as well as the insurance company's underwriting, administration, and investment management fees.


The contract may have a specific maturity date or the assets may be managed to a constant duration, in which case the contract has no specified maturity date (referred to as "evergreen"). Additional flexibility is provided to the contract holder within this structure to establish individual investment guidelines for maturity, credit quality, and diversification. A variety of terms and conditions may be included in the contract, but the key feature is the provision for payments to plan participants at book value for qualified withdrawals.

# Synthetic GICs

Synthetic GICs provide the features of a separate-account GIC with the additional advantage that the contract holder retains actual ownership and custody of the assets underlying the contract. In a typical synthetic structure, the investor purchases a fixed-income security (or portfolio of securities) and enters into a contract with a third-party guarantor. This third party is typically a bank or an insurance company, which agrees to accommodate benefit payments and other qualified participant withdrawals at the contract's book value. The contract is typically referred to as a wrapper agreement, and the issuer is called a wrap provider.

The investor retains ownership of the underlying pool of securities and receives an interest crediting rate equal to the annualized effective yield of the securities with an adjustment for fees and other factors. Additionally, the contract guarantees the investor a minimum rate of interest, usually  $0\%$ , to protect against a loss of principal. In exchange for these considerations, the wrap provider receives a fee that varies according to the risk assumed.

A synthetic GIC arrangement may involve as many as four parties, including an investor, a wrap provider, an outside money manager, and a trustee/custodian. One financial institution may provide all services for an investor (bundled product) or the service providers may be different entities (unbundled product). Regardless of the parties involved, the structural mechanics are similar. The terms of the wrap agreement transform a portfolio of marketable securities, whose values fluctuate, into a synthetic GIC.

# Buy-and-Hold Synthetics

In a buy-and-hold synthetic structure, the investor purchases a single security which is usually held to its final maturity. The contract's crediting rate generally remains fixed, although rate resets may occur if expected or actual cash flows change. In these respects, buy-and-hold synthetics closely resemble traditional GICs. To date, asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities have been used heavily in buy-and-hold structures due to their high credit quality and relatively attractive yields. The buy-and-hold synthetic can also be structured with an interest rate swap embedded within a wrap agreement. With this version of the product, a floating-rate security is purchased and the floating interest rate is exchanged for a fixed rate. A wide array of features have been used in these arrangements, although use of callable, extendible, or amortizable (based on the performance of an index) structures have been most common.


# Actively Managed Synthetics

The rationale behind the utilization of managed synthetics is the belief that active investment management enhances investment returns and leads to higher contract crediting rates. Added benefits include broader diversification and the ability to buy and sell securities or adjust the portfolio's duration, which enhances flexibility. Portfolios are constructed using the full range of fixed-income securities including U.S. Treasuries and agencies, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and corporate bonds.

More complex instruments, such as interest rate swaps, futures, and options are also utilized, although to a lesser degree. The interest earned by investors over time equals the total return on the underlying portfolio of securities, less wrap and investment management fees. With managed synthetics, the volatility of annual returns is greatly reduced because of book value accounting. Exhibit 23.1 illustrates the smoothing effects of a wrap contract on a portfolio of marketable securities. Quarterly returns from the Lehman Brothers Intermediate Government/Corporate Bond Index are charted over a recent 10-year period. Overlaid on this exhibit are the returns that would have resulted in each period had the index had been wrapped, net of annual wrap fees of 10 basis points. As can be seen, the wrapped portfolio's quarterly returns are considerably more stable.

Managed synthetics are available in two forms, immunized and constant duration (evergreen). An immunized contract has a fixed maturity and, hence, the duration of the underlying portfolio is lowered over time to meet the maturity date. Evergreen contracts are managed within established duration bands and a specific maturity date is not usually established. To date, evergreen contracts have been the most commonly used managed synthetic.

EXHIBIT 23.1 Quarterly Return Comparisons (January 1987-June 2001)

# Alpha Synthetics

A newer hybrid referred to as the alpha synthetic combines the characteristics of the buy-and-hold and managed structures. In the alpha structure, an interest rate swap is embedded in a wrap contract. The investor agrees to pay the total return of an established benchmark for a specified period of time in exchange for a fixed rate of return known as the base rate. The base rate paid is a function of current Treasury yields and interest rate swap spreads relative to the index selected. The portfolio is then actively managed to outperform the selected index and any positive performance margin, referred to as portfolio alpha, is earned by the investor.

The initial crediting rate usually equals the base rate less wrap and investment management fees. Sometimes an estimate of the expected outperformance of the manager is added to the base rate to establish the initial crediting rate. The crediting rate is then reset periodically, often annually, to reflect the actual performance of the portfolio.

# Stable-Value Pooled Funds

Individual stable-value portfolios may typically invest in most, if not all, of the products described in this chapter. However, many employee benefit plans have opted to utilize a professionally managed stable-value collective fund rather than attempt to manage their own portfolio. This is especially true in small to midsize plans, where it is increasingly diffi cult to attain appropriate portfolio diversification without incurring significant transaction costs. In addition, many larger plans utilize a pooled fund vehicle as a buffer within their portfolio to provide immediate liquidity for qualified withdrawals. Such a liquidity fund or buffer is often a contractual requirement stipulated by the issuer to minimize the likelihood of tapping its contracts for book-value payments. For that reason, investing in a stable-value collective fund can serve to enhance a portfolio's overall yield given that, over time, it outperforms shorter-term investments such as money market funds.


Stable-value pooled funds operate similar to mutual funds except that they are exempt from registration as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The funds are collective trusts offered through banks and trust companies to fiduciary clients and can accept only qualified employee benefit plans as investors—including any plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Service Code and deferred-compensation plans described in section 457 of the Code. The funds are typically valued daily in the same way as mutual funds and, therefore, offer substantial flexibility to a plan sponsor for investing participant contributions and paying out plan benefits. Pooled funds invest in the full range of stable-value products, offering to a plan ongoing professional management, broad diversification, high credit quality, and competitive returns.

# THE EVOLUTION OF STABLE VALUE

Having defined the various stable-value products available today, a review of the market from an historical perspective may provide some insight into both the current use of these products within the context of portfolio management and where stable value may evolve in the future.

# The Beginnings

Following enactment of the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the concept began to emerge of plan participants directing their own investments in defined-contribution plans. A significant result of this legislation was the increased utilization of guaranteed annuity contracts (GACs), which would hold a dominant position within these plans for years to come. Offered by the life insurance industry, which has been in the forefront of pension development and management in the United States, the GAC (also referred to as an immediate participation guarantee contract) was a nonmaturing contract featuring a fixed rate of interest that was convertible to an individual annuity upon retirement. This option was popular until the substantial rise in interest rates in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the comparatively low rates of interest of the GAC created dissatisfaction among participants versus the double-digit, short-term market rates available at the time. These events prompted the creation of the guaranteed investment contract (GIC) of today, which retained the fixed-rate feature while offering relatively short, set maturity dates to allow for more rapid reinvestment and competitive returns.


Concurrent with these events, there were significant overhauls in the U.S. tax code, ultimately providing for tax-deferred contributions by participants to qualified employee benefit plans—including the  $401(\mathrm{k})$  plan. These modifications prompted explosive growth in defined contribution plan formation, rising employee participation, and placed the investment decision-making responsibility in the hands of the individual plan participant. GICs were easy to understand. The fixed-rate, fixed-maturity structure was quite similar to bank certificates of deposit (CDs), so they were a likely beneficiary of the changes and grew rapidly. This growth attracted competition and, in 1987, a limited number of banks began issuing BICs to compete with GICs.

During this period, many plan sponsors managed their GIC options internally and purchased GIC and BIC contracts directly from the issuers or through consultants or GIC brokers. Some plans utilized a single insurance company's GIC, offering either a class year structure (participants received a new rate each year on their contributions) or a blended rate, which changed each year. In an effort to provide a diversified GIC option to smaller plans or to larger plans in their startup phase, many banks began offering GIC pooled funds in the mid-1980s. These funds featured independent professional management, credit oversight, diversification, and a mutual-fund-type structure and liquidity (subject to certain restrictions).

# The Rise of Alternatives (Synthetics)

Traditional GICs were thought to be relatively safe, offering a guarantee of principal and interest to the participant. This perception began to change in the wake of the savings & loan crisis of the late 1980s, which was accompanied by credit concerns about banks and insurance companies, as well. It culminated with the default and seizure of Executive Life by the California state insurance commissioner in 1991.

In response to the growing credit and diversification concerns of GIC investors, Bankers Trust began offering the first synthetic GIC alternative in 1990, called BASIC—benefits accessible securities investment contract—which provided a book-value guarantee (wrapper) on an individ- ual marketable fixed-income security. Bankers Trust followed in 1991 with the managed BASIC, which wrapped a portfolio of securities.


As synthetics gradually filtered into the marketplace, Bankers Trust was one of a limited number of active issuers. Purchasers of these early products tended to be more sophisticated investors, such as plan sponsors that managed their pension plans internally or professional stable-value managers. Following the highly publicized defaults of Mutual Benefit Life (1992) and Confederation Life (1994), however, synthetic GICs became widely used to enhance portfolio diversification and to reduce credit risk.

A time line of key market developments appears in Exhibit 23.2. The insurance industry quickly followed Bankers Trust's lead. It responded with a wrap contract of its own as well as increased efforts to market separate account GICs that offer features similar to wrapper agreements, although asset ownership and custody remained with the insurance company. Pooled funds also grew in popularity as plan sponsors sought to hire outside fiduciaries to manage their portfolios following issuer defaults. The larger, well diversified pooled funds were found to be an attractive alternative to in-house management.

# The Stable-Value Market Today

Because of its unique position in the defined contribution market, the stable-value market has evolved from the old GIC mantle to an entire industry with its own association. Many stable-value professionals are now advancing the argument that stable value is an asset class separate to itself, given its unique risk/return characteristics. Indeed, many plan sponsors and plan participants must agree, as stable-value assets, by some estimates, now exceed \$225 billion.

While traditional GICs historically captured the largest share of invested assets within the stable-value market, they have recently been eclipsed by synthetic GICs as the dominant asset as investors have been attracted to the diversification and improved flexibility synthetics provide. According to data released by the Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association (LIMRA) and the Stable Value Investment Association, synthetic GICs now have a  $51\%$  market share ( \$115 billion) as compared with traditional GICs which now have a 40\%$  market share (91 billion). The migration toward synthetics has been especially prevalent among professional stable-value managers. According to Hueler Analytics, synthetic GICs accounted for  $67\%$  of stable-value pooled fund assets as of September 30, 2001. A breakdown of stable-value assets by product market share is provided in Exhibit 23.3.

Enticed by rising demand and relatively attractive fees, numerous wrap providers have now entered the market. Banks, including the domestic branches of foreign institutions, now dominate with an estimated  $67\%$  share of total wrapped assets. Insurance companies, despite some restrictions that have limited their ability to provide synthetics, have captured  $33\%$  of the market. A list of active wrap providers appears in Exhibit 23.4.

# STABLE-VALUE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

Stable-value portfolio management has changed dramatically in recent years as the combination of innovative products and new providers has virtually redefined how portfolios are structured and managed. The increased use of GIC alternatives such as synthetics has advanced portfolio management to the point where most traditional bond management strategies can be emulated within stable-value portfolios, while maintaining the low return volatility characteristics of stable value through book-value wrappers. In fact, major bond market participants such as multinational banks, securities dealers, and fixed-income managers have been at the forefront of product development and industry change as they have sought ways to apply their expertise to a market which, until recently, had been dominated by insurance companies.


This section highlights some general considerations in managing the traditional stable-value portfolio, with an emphasis on the use of synthetics. It also discusses some of the relevant contract terms and considerations impacting the portfolio structuring process.

# Stable-Value Portfolio Objectives

Consistent with the role of stable value as the safe option in most defined contribution plans today, the overriding objective in managing these portfolios is preservation of principal. Liquidity to meet participant withdrawals is an additional factor, as is earning a fairly stable return which exceeds that of shorter-maturity alternatives. Portfolio management strategies should address these objectives and should guide the selection of individual issues.

# Credit Quality

All holdings in a stable-value portfolio—whether traditional GICs/BICs, wrap contracts, or assets underlying wrap contracts—must be high-quality instruments. A stringent credit review process is used initially to review issuers and to monitor them on an ongoing basis. Most managers establish minimum credit quality rating standards of single-A or double-A and require that the overall quality rating of the portfolio exceed Aa3 as measured by Moody's Investors Service or AA- by Standard & Poor's. Synthetic GICs can improve portfolio credit quality, since their underlying securities are often obligations of the U.S. government or its agencies, well structured mortgage/asset-backed securities, or highly rated corporate bonds. Investors must look deeper than the financial statements and the opinions of the rating agencies, however. Factors including the issuer's mix of business, amount of leverage, investment portfolio structure and liquidity, and the breadth and depth of management must also be explored.

# Diversification

Diversification is a critical element in any portfolio management process and was a particularly thorny issue in stable-value portfolios prior to the advent of synthetics. Fiduciaries of employee benefit plans are charged with adequately diversifying portfolios under ERISA to minimize the risk of large losses. It could be argued that many stable-value portfolios historically did not fulfill this obligation because they were exposed almost entirely to financial services companies, often with large exposures to single issuers. As discussed earlier, defaults in the early 1990s drew attention to the diversification issue, however, and led to the propagation of synthetics.

Prudent diversification standards limit portfolio assets invested in a single issuer to no more than  $10\%$ . Most fixed-income practitioners limit holdings of non-U.S. government issues to no more than  $5\%$  and broadly diversify among different fixed-income sectors, industries, and security types. A similar result can be achieved in stable-value portfolios by looking through to the securities underlying synthetics. Traditional

GICs/BICs should be viewed as an important sector of the portfolio, but limited by industry diversification guidelines similar to other holdings.

Diversification constraints should be measured according to the net exposure to an individual issuer or sector. For contract issuers, full principal exposure of traditional issues and the difference between the market and book values of their synthetic contracts should be totaled. Likewise, credit exposure is measured for all underlying holdings. A well-diversified stable-value portfolio is portrayed in Exhibits 23.5 and 23.6. As shown, diversification is properly measured at both the aggregate portfolio and underlying security levels.

# Maturity Structure

The maturity structure of stable-value portfolios must ensure that liquidity is adequate for meeting participant withdrawals. Generally, a buffer of available cash equal to at least  $5\%$  of the portfolio is invested in a stable-value collective fund, a money market fund, or other liquid, short-term instruments. Individual portfolio holdings are then structured with longer maturities to provide funds at regular intervals. Laddering the portfolio in this fashion assures that funds are available to accommodate liquidity needs and reinvest at current market rates. Portfolio maturity structures are typically short, averaging two to three years, with the longest holdings rarely exceeding five to seven years.

EXHIBIT 23.6 Hypothetical Stable-Value Portfolio—Securities Level Diversification

Synthetic contracts, however, have greatly improved the flexibility in portfolio maturity structuring, since the underlying securities are highly marketable. Liquidity may be constrained if the underlying securities' market value is significantly below their book value. When market value is near book value or higher, however, the portfolio manager is more able to meet unusual withdrawal requirements or shift the composition of the portfolio.

When structuring maturities, actively managed synthetics with constant durations must be factored into the equation. The average maturity of each active portfolio may be used as a proxy for the contract's maturity. However, managed contracts neither mature nor provide cashflow contributions within the broader portfolio structure.

# Duration and Convexity

Previously, the exclusive use of traditional GICs precluded the need to understand duration or convexity. However, the use of synthetics requires portfolio managers to track the duration characteristics of the securities underlying synthetics within a stable-value fund. Sophisticated analytical systems are required for this effort. Again, given the principal protection objective of stable-value funds, the volatility of underlying securities should be consistent with a two- to three-year average matu rity. Volatility measurement is especially important when securities that possess various cash-flow characteristics, such as mortgage passthrough or mortgage/asset-backed securities are used. Guidelines must be established for active managers to assure that the use of higher-risk mortgage securities is limited. The negative convexity in these instruments can dramatically affect cash flows, which impacts the market value of the underlying portfolio and, thus, the crediting rate of the contract.


# Asset Allocation Among Synthetic Structures

Portfolio strategies devised at the aggregate portfolio level must specify the allocation levels for different types of synthetic contracts as well as different issuers. No specific formula for allocation exists, for it depends upon the manager's level of comfort with synthetics, as well as his or her expertise. One approach is, first, to determine allocations to cash and traditional contracts, then allocate remaining assets to synthetic structures with a balance between buy-and-hold and actively managed contracts. The buy-and-hold structures provide cash flow to the broader portfolio and should be structured with portfolio guidelines for credit quality, diversification, and maturity in mind.

Actively managed synthetics are structured to achieve certain return objectives, but must also comply with the aggregate portfolio guidelines. A benchmark is commonly selected and management guidelines are established relative to this bogey. The amount of latitude given to investment managers should be carefully considered. Wrap providers that are liable for the shortfalls incurred when a portfolio's market value drops below book value will typically limit the investment manager's ability to move the portfolio's duration away from its benchmark. Wrap providers also limit, if not ban completely, the use of higher-risk securities, which allows them to quantify potential liabilities and contain risk.

# Portfolio Management—Another View

More recently, larger plan sponsors have taken a less traditional approach in managing their stable-value portfolios, choosing to view them in a way that is more similar to their other fixed-income options, only with a book-value wrapper. This allocation strategy involves hiring one or more active fixed-income managers for the fund, each with a particular area of expertise or style, to manage actively all of the assets in the plan option—similar to the way they would structure their marketable bond fund or their defined-benefit plan fixed-income portfolio. The plan sponsor then secures one or more book-value wrapper agreements to provide for portfolio valuations at book.

Each manager must adhere to a set of investment guidelines agreed upon with the plan sponsor and wrap provider. The sponsor may maintain a liquidity reserve for payment of normal plan benefit payments to reduce the likelihood of book-value payments from the active synthetic contracts.

If the plan's cash flow history has consistently been positive, the plan sponsor may retain little or no reserve. But the sponsor will be required by the wrap provider to purchase only experience-rated (participating) contracts, so that any shortfall between the market value of the portfolio and book value in the event of a payout will be recovered from the plan rather than absorbed by the wrap provider.

# Contract Considerations

Given that there are no industry standards governing the various types of stable-value contracts, they may vary materially from one issuer to another. As such, a thorough contract review is imperative and should be completed prior to the contract's final execution. All contracts will have terms dealing with the legal representations and warranties of the parties as well as provisions relating to the calculation of the credited rate of interest; contract withdrawals; terminations, including formulae for market-value adjustment; and the hierarchy for withdrawals within the total plan (that is, pro rata or LIFO).

Synthetic contracts are more complex, requiring additional provisions relating to the treatment of any losses realized from the liquidation of the underlying securities in the event of a withdrawal or termination. Synthetic contracts may be experience rated or non-experience rated (also called participating or nonparticipating). If experience rated, any losses realized from security sales to fund a withdrawal would be borne by the plan and recovered through a lower crediting rate of interest to participants. For non-experience-rated contracts, the risk of loss is borne by the issuer. As might be expected, non-experience-rated contracts have a somewhat higher fee than experience-rated contracts to compensate the issuer for the additional risk.

# THE FUTURE OF STABLE VALUE

The tremendous change occurring recently in stable-value products, providers, and strategies will continue to reshape the market in coming years. While aggregate industry assets will more than likely experience only modest growth until the long-awaited retirement of baby boomers begins sometime around the year 2007, significant shifts will continue within the market in terms of product use and development, portfolio management strategies, and the players themselves. This section briefly highlights some of the market's major trends and provides some thoughts about the future.


From a product standpoint, pooled funds and actively managed synthetics are likely to continue to experience solid growth at the expense of traditional GICs, the use of which is expected to decline further. Separate account GICs will be utilized, but to a lesser extent than synthetics. Fixed-income managers are the clear beneficiary of the movement to managed synthetics and they will continue to play a bigger and bigger role in the marketplace. Indeed, one of the more interesting developments to watch will be the vanishing distinction between fixed-income managers and stable-value managers.

For the stable-value asset manager, market growth in the immediate future will largely be attained by successfully capturing other segments of the defined-contribution market, such as public deferred compensation plans (457) and retirement plans for tax-exempt organizations (403[b]). These sectors are just beginning to follow the corporate market in offering more diversified stable-value options including synthetic GICs and pooled funds at the expense of bank savings vehicles and fixed annuities.

Product innovations are continuing, as well. The SEC recently registered a stable-value fund for the first time. The mutual fund provides a professionally managed, well diversified fund in a format that is popular with participants, providing them with the ability to track their investments daily in the newspapers together with "portability" at retirement. Innovations continue as well within synthetic structures, including wrapping of specialized fixed-income styles and other asset classes such as high-yield, international bonds, and even equities.

While these newer structures are still a comparatively small part of the market, the quest for higher yields is beginning to manifest itself in riskier strategies. Plan sponsors must take care to understand all of the strategies that are utilized in their stable-value option and make sure they are comfortable that appropriate risk levels are maintained given the objective of principal preservation stated for this investment option.

On the issuer side, wrap fees have continued to plummet as these contracts have virtually become commoditized. Fees for wrapper agreements are averaging 8 to 12 basis points, and many deals have been struck at lower levels. It is likely that continued declines in wrap fees will cause consolidation on the issuer side of the industry, with the emergence of a few very large players.

A final trend that is being promoted within the industry relates to stable value as a distinct asset class, highly efficient in terms of risk and return. With attractive yields and low volatility of returns, many in the industry are beginning to recommend stable value as a substitute in balanced funds for traditional bond portfolios. Given the higher risk-adjusted returns, investors could reduce risk (volatility) in their portfolios by utilizing stable value in place of marketable bonds. Likewise, investors could increase their exposure to equities and improve expected returns while maintaining the same level of return volatility by utilizing stable value in balanced account options.


Whether stable value becomes a staple in balanced account strategies remains to be seen. What is clear is that participants applaud the high-return/low-volatility nature of stable-value investments and will likely continue to allocate a large portion of their fixed-income investments to this asset class in the future.
