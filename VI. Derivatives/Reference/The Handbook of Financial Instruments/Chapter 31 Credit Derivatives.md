With the exception of holders of default-free instruments such as U.S. Treasuries or British Gilts, a key risk run by investors in bonds is credit risk, the risk that the bond issuer will default on the debt. To meet the need of investors to hedge this risk, the market uses credit derivatives. These are financial instruments originally introduced to protect banks and other institutions against losses arising from credit events. As such, they are instruments designed to lay off or take on credit risk. Since their inception, they have been used by portfolio managers to enhance returns, to trade credit, for speculative purposes, and as hedging instruments.

In this chapter we provide a description of the main types of credit derivatives and how they may be used by fixed-income portfolio managers. We also consider how the risks in credit default swaps may sometimes not be fully understood, and how this highlights the need for more awareness on the legal and documentation aspects of such instruments.

# CREDIT RISK

Credit derivatives allow investors to manage the credit risk exposure of their portfolios or asset holdings, essentially by providing insurance against a deterioration in credit quality of the borrowing entity. $^{1}$  If there is a technical default by the borrower $^{2}$  or an actual default on the loan itself and the bond is marked down in price, the losses suffered by the investor can be recouped in part or in full through the payout made by the credit derivative.


Credit risk is the risk that a borrowing entity will default on a loan, either through inability to maintain the interest servicing or because of bankruptcy or insolvency leading to inability to repay the principal itself. When technical or actual default occurs, bondholders suffer a loss as the value of their asset declines, and the potential greatest loss is that of the entire asset.

The extent of credit risk fluctuates as the fortunes of borrowers change in line with their own economic circumstances and the macroeconomic business cycle. The magnitude of risk is described by a firm's credit rating. Rating agencies undertake a formal analysis of the borrower, after which a rating is announced. The issues considered in the rating analysis include:

■ the financial position of the firm itself, for example, its balance sheet position and anticipated cash flows and revenues;
■ other firm-specific issues such as the quality of the management and succession planning;
■ an assessment of the firm's ability to meet scheduled interest and principal payments, both in its domestic and foreign currencies; the outlook for the industry as a whole, and competition within it;
■ general assessments for the domestic economy.

Another measure of credit risk is the credit risk premium, which is the difference between yields on the same-currency government benchmark bonds and corporate bonds. This premium is the compensation required by investors for holding bonds that are not default-free. The credit premium required will fluctuate as individual firms and sectors are perceived to offer improved or worsening credit risk, and as the general health of the economy improves or worsens.

# Credit Risk and Credit Derivatives

Credit derivatives are financial contracts designed to reduce or eliminate credit risk exposure by providing insurance against losses suffered due to credit events. A payout under a credit derivative is triggered by a credit event. As banks define default in different ways, the terms under which a credit derivative is executed usually include a specification of what constitutes a credit event.


The principle behind credit derivatives is straightforward. Investors desire exposure to nondefault-free debt because of the higher returns that this offers. However such exposure brings with it concomitant credit risk. This can be managed with credit derivatives. At the same time, the exposure itself can be taken on synthetically if, for instance, there are compelling reasons why a cash market position cannot be established. The flexibility of credit derivatives provides users with a number of advantages and as they are over-the-counter (OTC) products, they can be designed to meet specific user requirements.

We focus on credit derivatives as instruments that may be used to manage risk exposure inherent in a corporate or non-AAA sovereign bond portfolio. They may also be used to manage the credit risk of commercial loan books. The intense competition amongst commercial banks, combined with rapid disintermediation, has meant that banks have been forced to evaluate their lending policy, with a view to improving profitability and return on capital. The use of credit derivatives assists banks with restructuring their businesses, because they allow banks to repackage and parcel out credit risk, while retaining assets on balance sheet (when required) and thus maintain client relationships.

As the instruments isolate certain aspects of credit risk from the underlying loan or bond and transfer them to another entity, it becomes possible to separate the ownership and management of credit risk from the other features of ownership associated with the assets in question. This means that illiquid assets such as bank loans, and illiquid bonds can have their credit risk exposures transferred; the bank owning the assets can protect against credit loss even if it cannot transfer the assets themselves.

The same principles carry over to the credit risk exposures of portfolio managers. For fixed-income portfolio managers some of the advantages of credit derivatives include the following: they can be tailor-made to meet the specific requirements of the entity buying the risk protection, as opposed to the liquidity or term of the underlying reference asset;

in theory, they can be "sold short" without risk of a liquidity or delivery squeeze, as it is a specific credit risk that is being traded. In the cash market it is not possible to "sell short" a bank loan, for example, but a credit derivative can be used to establish synthetically the economic effect of such a position; as they theoretically isolate credit risk from other factors such as client relationships and interest rate risk, credit derivatives introduce a formal pricing mechanism to price credit issues only. This means a market can develop in credit only, allowing more efficient pricing, and it becomes possible to model a term structure of credit rates;

they are off-balance sheet instruments and, as such, incorporate tremendous flexibility and leverage, exactly like other financial derivatives. For instance, bank loans are not particularly attractive investments for certain investors because of the administration required in managing and servicing a loan portfolio. However an exposure to bank loans and their associated return can be achieved by, say, a total return swap while simultaneously avoiding the administrative costs of actually owning the assets. Hence credit derivatives allow investors access to specific credits while allowing banks access to further distribution for bank loan credit risk.

Thus credit derivatives can be an important instrument for bond portfolio managers as well as commercial banks, who wish to increase the liquidity of their portfolios, gain from the relative value arising from credit pricing anomalies, and enhance portfolio returns. Some key applications are summarized below.

# Diversifying the Credit Portfolio

A bank or portfolio manager may wish to take on credit exposure by providing credit protection on assets that it already owns, in return for a fee. This enhances income on their portfolio. They may sell credit derivatives to enable non-financial counterparties to gain credit exposures, if these clients do not wish to purchase the assets directly. In this respect the bank or asset manager performs a credit intermediation role.

# Reducing Credit Exposure

A bank can reduce credit exposure either for an individual loan or a sectoral concentration, by buying a credit default swap. This may be desirable for assets in their portfolio that cannot be sold for client relationship or tax reasons. For fixed-income managers a particular asset or collection of assets may be viewed as favorable holdings in the long-term, but is at risk from short-term downward price movement. In this instance a sale would not fit in with long-term objectives, however short-term credit protection can be obtained via a credit swap.

# Acting as a Credit Derivatives Market Maker

A financial entity may wish to set itself up as a market maker in credit derivatives. In this case it may or may not hold the reference assets directly, and depending on its appetite for risk and the liquidity of the market, it can offset derivative contracts as and when required.

# Credit Event

The occurrence of a specified credit event will trigger payment of the default payment by the seller of protection to the buyer of protection. Contracts specify physical or cash settlement. In physical settlement, the protection buyer transfers to the protection seller the deliverable obligation (usually the reference asset or assets), with the total principal outstanding equal to the nominal amount specified in the default swap contract. The protection seller simultaneously pays to the buyer  $100\%$  of the nominal. In cash settlement, the protection seller hands to the buyer the difference between the nominal amount of the default swap and the final value for the same nominal amount of the reference asset. This final value is usually determined by means of a poll of dealer banks.

The following may be specified as credit events in the legal documentation between counterparties:

■ downgrade in S&P and/or Moody's credit rating below a specified minimum level;
■ financial or debt restructuring, for example occasioned under administration or as required under U.S. bankruptcy protection;
■ bankruptcy or insolvency of the reference asset obligor;
■ default on payment obligations, such as bond coupon and continued nonpayment after a specified time period.
■ technical default, for example the nonpayment of interest or coupon when it falls due; a change in credit spread payable by the obligor above a specified maximum level.

The 1999 ISDA credit default swap documentation specifies bankruptcy, failure to pay, obligation default, debt moratorium, and restructuring to be credit events. Note that it does not specify a rating downgrade to be a credit event.

EXHIBIT 31.1 Credit Default Swap

# CREDIT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

We now review some of the more common credit derivative instruments.

# Credit Default Swap

The most common credit derivative is the credit default swap, credit swap, or default swap. This is a bilateral contract in which a periodic fixed fee or a one-off premium is paid to a protection seller, in return for which the seller will make a payment on the occurrence of a specified credit event. The fee is usually quoted as a basis point multiplier of the nominal value. The swap can refer to a single asset, known as the reference asset or underlying asset, or a basket of assets. The default payment can be paid in whatever way suits the protection buyer or both counterparties. For example it may be linked to the change in price of the reference asset or another specified asset, it may be fixed at a predetermined recovery rate, or it may be in the form of actual delivery of the reference asset at a specified price. The basic structure is illustrated at Exhibit 31.1.

The credit default swap enables one party to transfer its credit exposure to another party. Banks may use default swaps to trade sovereign and corporate credit spreads without trading the actual assets themselves; for example someone who has gone long a default swap (the protection buyer) will gain if the reference asset obligor suffers a rating downgrade or defaults, and can sell the default swap at a profit if he can find a buyer counterparty. This is because the cost of protection on the reference asset will have increased as a result of the credit event. The original buyer of the default swap need never have owned a bond issued by the reference asset obligor.


The maturity of the credit swap does not have to match the maturity of the reference asset and in most cases does not. On default the swap is terminated and default payment by the protection seller or guarantor is calculated and handed over. The guarantor may have the asset delivered to him and pay the nominal value, or may cash settle the swap contract.

# Credit Default Swap Example

XYZ plc credit spreads are currently trading at 120 bps over the benchmark government bond for 5-year maturities and 195 bps over for 10-year maturities. A portfolio manager hedges a 10 million holding of 10-year paper by purchasing the following credit default swap, written on the 5-year bond. This hedge protects for the first five years of the holding, and in the event of XYZ's credit spread widening, will increase in value and may be sold on or before expiry at a profit. The 10-year bond holding also earns 75 bps over the shorter-term paper for the portfolio manager.

Term: 5 years

Reference credit: XYZ plc 5-year bond

Credit event: The business day following occurrence of specified credit event

Default payment: Nominal value of bond  $\times$  [100 - price of bond after credit event]

Swap premium:  $3.35\%$

Assume that midway into the life of the swap there is a technical default on the XYZ plc 5-year bond, such that its price now stands at  $28. Under the terms of the swap the protection buyer delivers the bond to the seller, who pays out$ 7.2 million to the buyer.

# Credit Options

Credit options are also bilateral OTC financial contracts. A credit option is a contract designed to meet specific hedging or speculative requirements of an entity, which may purchase or sell the option to meet its objectives. A credit call option gives the buyer the right without the obligation to purchase the underlying credit-sensitive asset, or a credit spread, at a specified price and specified time (or period of time). A credit put option gives the buyer the right without the obligation to sell the underlying credit-sensitive asset or credit spread. By purchasing credit options banks and other institutions can take a view on credit spread movements for the cost of the option premium only, without recourse to actual loans issued by an obligor. The writer of credit options seeks to earn premium income.


Credit option terms are similar to those used for conventional equity options. A call option written on a stock grants the purchaser the right but not the obligation to purchase a specified amount of the stock at a set price and time. A credit option can be used by bond investors to hedge against a decline in the price of specified bonds, in the event of a credit event such as a ratings downgrade. The investor would purchase an option whose payoff profile is a function of the credit quality of the bond, so that a loss on the bond position is offset by the payout from the option.

As with conventional options, there are both vanilla credit options and exotic credit options. The vanilla credit option grants the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy (or sell if a put option) an asset or credit spread at a specified price (the strike price) for a specified period of time up to the maturity of the option. A credit option allows a market participant to take a view on credit only, and no other exposure such as interest rates. As an example consider an investor who believes that a particular credit spread, which can be that of a specific entity or the average for a sector (such as "all AA-rated sterling corporates"), will widen over the next six months. She can buy a 6-month call option on the relevant credit spread, for which a one-off premium (the price of the option) is paid. If the credit spread indeed does widen beyond the strike price during the six month period, the option will be in-the-money and the investor will gain. If not, the investor's loss is limited to the premium paid.

Exotic credit options are options that have one or more of their parameters changed from the vanilla norm; the same terms are used as in other option markets. Examples include the barrier credit option, which specifies a credit-event that would trigger (activate) the option or inactivate it. A digital credit option would have a payout profile that would be fixed, irrespective of how much in-the-money it was on expiry, and a zero payout if it expired out-of-the-money.

# Credit-Linked Note

Credit-linked notes exist in a number of forms, but all of them contain a link between the return they pay and the credit-related performance of the underlying reference asset. A standard credit-linked note is a security, usually issued by an investment-graded entity, that has an interest payment and fixed maturity structure similar to a vanilla bond. The performance of the note however, including the maturity value, is linked to the performance of specified underlying assets as well as that of the issuing entity. The notes are often used by borrowers to hedge against credit risk, and by investors to enhance the yield received on their holdings. Essentially credit-linked notes are hybrid instruments that combine a credit derivative with a vanilla bond. The credit-linked note pays regular coupons, however the credit derivative element is usually set to allow the issuer to decrease the principal amount if a credit event occurs.


For example consider an issuer of credit cards that wants to fund its (credit card) loan portfolio via an issue of debt. In order to reduce the credit risk of the loans, it issues a 2-year credit-linked note. The principal amount of the bond is  $100\%$  as usual, and it pays a coupon of  $7.50\%$ , which is 200 basis points above the 2-year benchmark yield. If, however, the incidence of bad debt amongst credit card holders exceeds  $10\%$  then the terms state that note holders will only receive back £85 per £100 nominal. The credit card issuer has in effect purchased a credit option that lowers its liability in the event that it suffers from a specified credit event, which in this case is an above-expected incidence of bad debts. The credit card bank has issued the credit-linked note to reduce its credit exposure, in the form of this particular type of credit insurance. If the incidence of bad debts is low, the note is redeemed at par. However if there is a high incidence of such debt, the bank will only have to repay a part of its loan liability.

Investors may wish to purchase the credit-linked note because the coupon paid on it will be above what the credit card bank would pay on a vanilla bond it issued, and higher than other comparable investments in the market. In addition, such notes are usually priced below par on issue. Assuming the notes are eventually redeemed at par, investors will also have realized a substantial capital gain.[7]

# The Total Return Swap

A total return swap (TRS), sometimes known as a total rate of return swap or TR swap, is an agreement between two parties to exchange the total return from a financial asset between them. This is designed to transfer the credit risk from one party to the other. It is one of the principal instruments used by banks and other financial instruments to manage their credit risk exposure, and as such, is a credit derivative. One definition of a TRS states that a TRS is a swap agreement in which the total return of a bank loan or credit-sensitive security is exchanged for some other cash flow, usually tied to LIBOR or some other loan or credit-sensitive security.[8]

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/34152bb9-0c82-464c-8d95-33ab992e7f99/5805a19b1e851c087a36a904468e977833d601794616ff14fae51821c8db35bb.jpg)
EXHIBIT 31.2 Total Return Swap

In some versions of a TRS the underlying reference asset is actually sold to the counterparty, with a corresponding swap transaction agreed alongside; in other versions there is no physical change of ownership of the underlying asset. The TRS trade itself can be to any maturity term, that is, it need not match the maturity of the underlying security. In a TRS the total return from the underlying asset is paid over to the counterparty in return for a fixed or floating cash flow. This makes it slightly different to other credit derivatives, as the payments between counterparties to a TRS are connected to changes in the market value of the underlying asset, as well as changes resulting from the occurrence of a credit event.

Exhibit 31.2 illustrates a generic TR swap. The two counterparties are labelled as banks, but the party termed "Bank A" can be any financial institution, including cash-rich fixed income portfolio managers such as insurance companies and hedge funds. In Exhibit 31.2 Bank A has contracted to pay the "total return" on a specified reference asset, while simultaneously receiving a LIBOR-based return from Bank B. The reference or underlying asset can be a bank loan such as a corporate loan or a sovereign or corporate bond. The total return payments from Bank A include the interest payments on the underlying loan as well as any appreciation in the market value of the asset. Bank B will pay the LIBOR-based return; it will also pay any difference if there is a depreciation in the price of the asset. The economic effect is as if Bank B owned the underlying asset, and as such, TR swaps are synthetic loans or securities. A significant feature is that Bank A will usually hold the underlying asset on its balance sheet, so that if this asset was originally on Bank B's balance sheet, this is a means by which the latter can have the asset removed from its balance sheet for the term of the TR swap. If we assume Bank A has access to LIBOR funding, it will receive a spread on this from Bank B. Under the terms of the swap, Bank B will pay the difference between the initial market value and any depreciation, so it is sometimes termed the "guarantor" while Bank A is the "beneficiary."


The total return on the underlying asset is made up of the interest payments and any change in the market value if there is capital appreciation. The value of an appreciation may be cash settled, or alternatively there may be physical delivery of the reference asset on maturity of the swap, in return for a payment of the initial asset value by the total return "receiver." The maturity of the TR swap need not be identical to that of the reference asset, and in fact it is rare for it to be so.

The swap element of the trade will usually pay on a quarterly or semiannual basis, with the underlying asset being revalued or marked-to-market on the refixing dates. The asset price is obtained from an independent third-party source such as Bloomberg or Reuters, or as the average of a range of market quotes. If the obligor of the reference asset defaults, the swap may be terminated immediately, with a net present value payment changing hands according to what this value is, or it may be continued with each party making appreciation or depreciation payments as appropriate. This second option is only available if there is a market for the asset, which is unlikely in the case of a bank loan. If the swap is terminated, each counterparty will be liable to the other for accrued interest plus any appreciation or depreciation of the asset. Commonly under the terms of the trade, the guarantor bank has the option to purchase the underlying asset from the beneficiary bank, and then deal directly with the loan defaulter.

There are a number of reasons why portfolio managers may wish to enter into TR swap arrangements. One of these is to reduce or remove credit risk. Using TR swaps as a credit derivative instrument, a party can remove exposure to an asset without having to sell it. In a vanilla TR swap, the total return payer retains the rights to the reference asset, although in some cases servicing and voting rights may be transferred. The total return receiver gains an exposure to the reference asset without having to pay out the cash proceeds that would be required to purchase it. As the maturity of the swap rarely matches that of the asset, the swap receiver may gain from the positive funding or carry that derives from being able to roll over short-term funding of a longer-term asset.[10] The total return payer on the other hand benefits from protection against market and credit risk for a specified period of time, without having to liquidate the asset itself. On maturity of the swap the total return payer may reinvest the asset if it continues to own it, or it may sell the asset in the open market. Thus the instrument may be considered to be a synthetic repo. $^{11}$  A TR swap agreement entered into as a credit derivative is a means by which banks can take on unfunded off-balance sheet credit exposure. Higher-rated banks that have access to LIBID funding can benefit by funding on-balance sheet assets that are credit protected through a credit derivative such as a TR swap, assuming the net spread of asset income over credit protection premium is positive.


A TR swap conducted as a synthetic repo is usually undertaken to effect the temporary removal of assets from the balance sheet. This may be desired for a number of reasons, for example if the institution is due to be analyzed by credit rating agencies or if the annual external audit is due shortly. Another reason a bank may wish to temporarily remove lower credit-quality assets from its balance sheet is if it is in danger of breaching capital limits in between the quarterly return periods. In this case, as the return period approaches, lower quality assets may be removed from the balance sheet by means of a TR swap, which is set to mature after the return period has passed.

Banks have employed a number of methods to price credit derivatives and TR swaps. Space does not permit an in-depth discussion of the different pricing techniques here. Essentially the pricing of credit derivatives is linked to that of other instruments; however the main difference between credit derivatives and other off-balance sheet products such as equity, currency, or bond derivatives is that the latter can be priced and hedged with reference to the underlying asset, which can be problematic when applied to credit derivatives. Credit products pricing uses statistical data on likelihood of default, probability of payout, level of risk tolerance, and a pricing model. With a TR swap the basic concept is that one party "funds" an underlying asset and transfers the total return of the asset to another party, in return for a (usually) floating return that is a spread over LIBOR. This spread is a function of: the credit rating of the swap counterparty;

the amount and value of the reference asset; the credit quality of the reference asset;
the funding costs of the beneficiary bank; any required profit margin;

the capital charge associated with the TR swap.

The TR swap counterparties must consider a number of risk factors associated with the transaction, which include: the probability that the TR beneficiary may default while the reference asset has declined in value, and

■ the reference asset obligor defaults, followed by default of the TR swap receiver before payment of the depreciation has been made to the payer or "provider".

The first risk measure is a function of the probability of default by the TR swap receiver and the market volatility of the reference asset, while the second risk is related to the joint probability of default of both factors as well as the recovery probability of the asset.

# APPLICATIONS FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGERS

Credit derivatives have allowed market participants to separate and disaggregate credit risk, and thence to trade this risk in a secondary market.[12] Initially portfolio managers used them to reduce credit exposure; subsequently they have been used in the management of portfolios to enhance portfolio yields and in the structuring of synthetic collateralized debt obligations. We summarize portfolio managers' main uses of credit derivatives next.

# Enhancing Portfolio Returns

Asset managers can derive premium income by trading credit exposures in the form of derivatives issued with synthetic structured notes. The multitranching aspect of structured products enables specific credit exposures (credit spreads and outright default), and their expectations to be sold to meet specific areas of demand. By using structured notes such as credit-linked notes tied to the assets in the reference pool of the portfolio manager, the trading of credit exposures is crystallized as added yield on the asset manager's fixed income portfolio. In this way the portfolio manager has enabled other market participants to gain an exposure to the credit risk of a pool of assets but not to any other aspects of the portfolio, and without the need to hold the assets themselves.

EXHIBIT 31.3 Reducing Credit Exposure

# Reducing Credit Exposure

Consider a portfolio manager that holds a large portfolio of bonds issued by a particular sector (say, utilities) and believes that spreads in this sector will widen in the short term. Previously, in order to reduce its credit exposure it would have to sell bonds, however this may crystallize a mark-to-market loss and may conflict with its long-term investment strategy. An alternative approach would be to enter into a credit default swap, purchasing protection for the short term; if spreads do widen these swaps will increase in value and may be sold at a profit in the secondary market. Alternatively the portfolio manager may enter into total return swaps on the desired credits. It pays the counterparty the total return on the reference assets, in return for LIBOR. This transfers the credit exposure of the bonds to the counterparty for the term of the swap, in return for the credit exposure of the counterparty.

Consider now the case of a portfolio manager wishing to mitigate credit risk from a growing portfolio (say, one that has just been launched). Exhibit 31.3 shows an example of an unhedged credit exposure to a hypothetical credit-risky portfolio. It illustrates the manager's expectation of credit risk building up to 250 million as the portfolio is ramped up, and then reducing to a more stable level as the credits become more established. A 3-year credit default swap entered into shortly after provides protection on half of the notional exposure, shown as the broken line. The net exposure to credit events has been reduced by a significant margin.

# Credit Switches and Zero-Cost Credit Exposure

Protection buyers utilizing credit default swaps must pay a premium in return for laying off their credit risk exposure. An alternative approach for an asset manager involves the use of credit switches for specific sectors of the portfolio. In a credit switch the portfolio manager purchases credit protection on one reference asset or pool of assets, and simultaneously sells protection on another asset or pool of assets.[13] For example, the portfolio manager would purchase protection for a particular fund and sell protection on another. Typically the entire transaction would be undertaken with one investment bank, which would price the structure so that the net cash flows would be zero. This has the effect of synthetically diversifying the credit exposure of the portfolio manager, enabling the manager to gain and/or reduce exposure to desired sectors.

# Exposure to Market Sectors

Investors can use credit derivatives to gain exposure to sectors for which they do not wish to have a cash market exposure. This can be achieved with an index swap, which is similar to a TR swap, with one counterparty paying a total return that is linked to an external reference index. The other party pays a LIBOR-linked coupon or the total return of another index. Indices that are used include the government bond index, an high-yield index or a technology stocks index. Assume that an investor believes that the bank loan market will outperform the mortgage-backed bond sector; to reflect this view the investor enters into an index swap in which he pays the total return of the mortgage index and receives the total return of the bank loan index.

Another possibility is synthetic exposure to foreign currency and money markets. Again we assume that an investor has a particular view on an emerging market currency. If he wishes, he can purchase a short-term (say one-year) domestic coupon-bearing note, whose principal redemption is linked to a currency factor. This factor is based on the ratio of the spot value of the foreign currency on issue of the note to the value on maturity. Such currency-linked notes can also be structured so that they provide an exposure to sovereign credit risk. The downside of currency-linked notes is that if the exchange rate goes the other way, the note will have a zero return, in effect a negative return once the investor's funding costs have been taken into account.

# Credit Spreads

Credit derivatives can be used to trade credit spreads. Assume that an investor has negative views on a certain emerging market government bond credit spread relative to U.K. gilts. The simplest way to reflect this view would be to go long a credit default swap on the sovereign, paying X basis points. Assuming that the investor's view is correct and the sovereign bonds decrease in price as their credit spread widens, the premium payable on the credit swap will increase. The investor's swap can then be sold into the market at this higher premium.


# Application of Total Return Swaps

Total return swaps are widely used by a range of different market participants including bank and repo market makers. We summarize some applications by portfolio managers in this section.

# Capital Structure Arbitrage

A capital structure arbitrage describes an arrangement whereby investors exploit mispricing between the yields received on two different loans by the same issuer. Assume that the reference entity has both a commercial bank loan and a subordinated bond issue outstanding, but that the former pays LIBOR plus 330 basis points while the latter pays LIBOR plus 230 basis points. An investor enters into a total return swap in which it effectively is purchasing the bank loan and selling short the bond. The nominal amounts will be at a ratio, for argument's sake let us say 2:1, as the bonds will be more price-sensitive to changes in credit status than the loans.

The trade is illustrated in Exhibit 31.4. The investor receives the "total return" on the bank loan, while simultaneously paying the return on the bond in addition to LIBOR plus 30 basis points, which is the price of the TR swap. The swap generates a net spread of 175 basis points, given by  $[(100\mathrm{bps}\times \frac{1}{2}) + 250\mathrm{bps}\times \frac{1}{2})]$ .

# Synthetic Repo

A portfolio manager believes that a particular bond that it does not hold is about to decline in price. To reflect this view the portfolio manager may do one of the following.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/34152bb9-0c82-464c-8d95-33ab992e7f99/80d4b256889067cfe154318df0c45534bfe0364e59e3400cdfcf758212f3b3b7.jpg)
EXHIBIT 31.4 Total Return Swap in Capital Structure Arbitrage

Sell the Bond in the Market and Cover the Resulting Short Position in Repo The cash flow out is the coupon on the bond, with capital gain if the bond falls in price. Assume that the repo rate is floating, say LIBOR plus a spread. The manager must be aware of the funding costs of the trade, so that unless the bond can be covered in repo at general collateral rates,[14] the funding will be at a loss. The yield on the bond must also be lower than the LIBOR plus spread received in the repo.

As an Alternative, Enter into a TR Swap The portfolio manager pays the total return on the bond and receives LIBOR plus a spread. If the bond yield exceeds the LIBOR spread, the funding will be negative, however the trade will gain if the trader's view is proved correct and the bond falls in price by a sufficient amount. If the breakeven funding cost (which the bond must exceed as it falls in value) is lower in the TR swap, this method will be used rather than the repo approach. This is more likely if the bond is special.

# Overview of TR Swap Applications

Total return swaps are increasingly used as synthetic repo instruments, most commonly by investors that wish to purchase the credit exposure of an asset without purchasing the asset itself. This is conceptually similar to what happened when interest-rate swaps were introduced, which enabled banks and other financial institutions to trade interest-rate risk without borrowing or lending cash funds.

Under a TR swap an asset such as a bond position may be removed from the balance sheet. In order to avoid an adverse impact on regular internal and external capital and credit exposure reporting, a bank may use TR swaps to reduce the amount of lower-quality assets on the balance sheet. This can be done by entering into a short-term TR swap with say, a 2-week term that straddles the reporting date. Bonds are removed from the balance sheet if they are part of a sale plus TR swap transaction. This is because legally the bank selling the asset is not required to repurchase bonds from the swap counterparty, nor is the total return payer obliged to sell the bonds back to the counterparty (or indeed sell the bonds at all on maturity of the TR swap).

# RISKS IN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS

As credit derivatives can be tailored to specific requirements in terms of reference exposure, term to maturity, currency, and cash flows, they have enabled market participants to establish exposure to specific entities without the need for them to hold the bond or loan of that entity. This has raised issues of the different risk exposure that this entails compared to the cash equivalent. A Moody's special report highlights the unintended risks of holding credit exposures in the form of default swaps and credit-linked notes.[15] Under certain circumstances it is possible for credit default swaps to create unintended risk exposure for holders, by exposing them to greater frequency and magnitude of losses compared to that suffered by a holder of the underlying reference credit.

In a credit default swap, the payout to a buyer of protection is determined by the occurrence of credit events. The definition of a credit event sets the level of credit risk exposure of the protection seller. A wide definition of "credit event" results in a higher level of risk. To reduce the likelihood of disputes, counterparties can adopt the ISDA Credit Derivatives definitions to govern their dealings. The Moody's report states that the current ISDA definitions do not unequivocally separate and isolate credit risk, and in certain circumstances credit derivatives can expose holders to additional risks. A reading of the report would appear to suggest that differences in definitions can lead to unintended risks being taken on by protection sellers. Two examples from the report are cited next as an illustration.

# Extending Loan Maturity

The bank debt of Conseco, a corporate entity, was restructured in August 2000. The restructuring provisions included deferment of the loan maturity by three months, higher coupon, corporate guarantee, and additional covenants. Under the Moody's definition, as lenders received compensation in return for an extension of the debt, the restructuring was not considered to be a "diminished financial obligation," although Conseco's credit rating was downgraded one notch. However under the ISDA definition, the extension of the loan maturity meant that the restructuring was considered to be a credit event, and thus triggered payments on default swaps written on Conseco's bank debt. Hence this was an example of a loss event under ISDA definitions that was not considered by Moody's to be a default.

# Risks of Synthetic Positions and Cash Positions Compared

Consider two investors in XYZ, one of whom owns bonds issued by XYZ while the other holds a credit-linked note (CLN) referenced to XYZ. Following a deterioration in its debt situation, XYZ violates a number of covenants on its bank loans, but its bonds are unaffected. XYZ's bank accelerates the bank loan, but the bonds continue to trade at 85 cents on the dollar, coupons are paid, and the bond is redeemed in full at maturity. However the default swap underlying the CLN cites "obligation acceleration" (of either bond or loan) as a credit event, so the holder of the CLN receives  $85\%$  of par in cash settlement and the CLN is terminated. However the cash investor receives all the coupons and the par value of the bonds on maturity.

These two examples illustrate how, as credit default swaps are defined to pay out in the event of a very broad range of definitions of a "credit event," portfolio managers may suffer losses as a result of occurrences that are not captured by one or more of the ratings agencies' rating of the reference asset. This results in a potentially greater risk for the portfolio manager compared to his position were he to actually hold the underlying reference asset. Essentially, therefore, it is important for the range of definitions of a "credit event" to be fully understood by counterparties, so that holders of default swaps are not taking on greater risk than is intended.

# CONCLUSIONS

Credit derivatives are well established instruments in the fixed-income markets, and their flexibility mirrors that of an earlier generation of derivatives such as swaps and options. This chapter has highlighted how they may be used both to hedge credit risk exposure as well as to enhance portfolio returns. It is clear though, that users need to be aware of the risks involved in writing credit swaps, such that the legal terms underpinning each contract are clearly defined and communicated.

Managed futures refers to the active trading of futures contracts and forward contracts on physical commodities, financial assets, and currencies. The purpose of the managed futures industry is to enable investors to profit from changes in futures prices. In this chapter managed futures as an investment vehicle are discussed.

# INDUSTRY BASICS

The managed futures industry is another skill-based style of investing. Investment managers attempt to use their special knowledge and insight in buying and selling futures and forward contracts to extract a positive return. These futures managers tend to argue that their superior skill is the key ingredient to derive profitable returns from the futures markets.

There are three ways to access the skill-based investing of the managed futures industry: public commodity pools, private commodity pools, and individual managed accounts. Commodity pools are investment funds that pool the money of several investors for the purpose of investing in the futures markets. They are similar in structure to hedge funds, and are considered a subset of the hedge fund marketplace.

Every commodity pool must be managed by a general partner. Typically, the general partner for the pool must register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures Association as a

Commodity Pool Operator (CPO). However, there are exceptions to the general rule.

Public commodity pools are open to the general public for investment in much the same way a mutual fund sells its shares to the public. Public commodity pools must file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission before distributing shares in the pool to investors. An advantage of public commodity pools is the low minimum investment and the frequency of liquidity (the ability to cash out).

Private commodity pools are sold to high net worth investors and institutional investors to avoid the lengthy registration requirements of the SEC and sometimes to avoid the lengthy reporting requirements of the CFTC. Otherwise, their investment objective is the same as a public commodity pool. An advantage of private commodity pools is usually lower brokerage commissions and greater flexibility to implement investment strategies and extract excess return from the futures markets.

Commodity pool operators (for either public or private pools) typically hire one or more Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) to manage the money deposited in the pool. CTAs are professional money managers in the futures markets.

Like CPOs, CTAs must register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA) before managing money for a commodity pool. In some cases a managed futures investment manager is registered as both a CPO and a CTA. In this case, the general partner for a commodity pool may also act as its investment adviser.

Last, wealthy and institutional investors can place their money directly with a CTA in an individually managed account. These separate accounts have the advantage of narrowly defined and specific investment objectives as well as full transparency to the investor.

CTAs may invest in both exchange-traded futures contracts and forward contracts. A forward contract has the same economic structure as a futures contract with one difference; it is traded over the counter. Forward contracts are private agreements that do not trade on a futures exchange. Therefore, they can have terms that vary considerably from the standard terms of an exchange-listed futures contracts. Forward contracts accomplish the same economic goal as futures contracts but with the flexibility of custom tailored terms.

# HISTORY OF MANAGED FUTURES

Organized futures trading began in the United States in the 1800s with the founding of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) in 1848. It was founded by 82 grain merchants and the first exchange floor was above a flour store. Originally, it was a cash market where grain traders came to buy and sell supplies of flour, timothy seed, and hay.


In 1851, the earliest futures contract in the United States was recorded for the forward delivery of 3,000 bushels of corn, and two years later, the CBOT established the first standard futures contract in corn. Since then, the heart and soul of the CBOT has been its futures contracts on agricultural crops grown primarily in the midwestern states: corn, wheat, and soybeans. Therefore, commodity futures exchanges were founded initially by grain producers and buyers to hedge the price risk associated with the harvest and sale of crops.

Other futures exchanges were established for similar reasons. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), for example, lists futures contracts on livestock. Chicago was once famous for its stockyards where cattle and hogs were herded to the market. Ranchers and buyers came to the CME to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase and sale of cattle and hogs.

Other exchanges are the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) where futures contracts on energy products are traded. The Commodity Exchange of New York (now the COMEX division of the NYMEX) lists futures contracts on precious and industrial metals. The New York Coffee, Sugar, and Cocoa Exchange lists futures contracts on (what else?) coffee, sugar, and cocoa. The New York Cotton Exchange lists contracts on cotton and frozen concentrated orange juice. $^{1}$  The Kansas City Board of Trade lists futures contracts on wheat and financial products such as the Value Line stock index.

Over the years, certain commodities have risen in prominence while others have faded. For instance, the heating oil futures contract was at one time listed as inactive on the NYMEX for lack of interest. For years, heating oil prices remained stable, and there was little interest or need to hedge the price risk of heating oil. Then along came the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973, and this contract quickly took on a life of its own as did other energy futures contracts.

Conversely, other futures contracts have faded away because of minimal input into the economic engine of the United States. For instance, rye futures traded on the CBOT from 1869 to 1970, and barley futures traded from 1885 to 1940. However, the limited importance of barley and rye in finished food products led to the eventual demise of these futures contracts.

As the wealth of America grew, a new type of futures contract has gained importance: financial futures. The futures markets changed dramatically in 1975 when the CBOT introduced the first financial futures contract on Government National Mortgage Association mortgage-backed certificates. This was followed two years later in 1977 with the introduction of a futures contract on the U.S. Treasury Bond. Today this is the most actively traded futures contract in the world.

The creation of a futures contract that was designed to hedge financial risk as opposed to commodity price risk opened up a whole new avenue of asset management for traders, analysts, and portfolio managers. Now, it is more likely that a financial investor will flock to the futures exchanges to hedge her investment portfolio than a grain purchaser will trade to hedge commodity price risk. Since 1975, more and more financial futures contracts have been listed on the futures exchanges. For instance, in 1997 stock index futures and options on the Dow Jones 30 Industrial Companies were first listed on the CBOT. The S&P 500 stock index futures and options (first listed in 1983) are the most heavily traded contracts on the CME. Additionally, currency futures were introduced on the CME in the 1970s (originally listed as part of the International Monetary Market).

With the advent of financial futures contracts more and more managed futures trading strategies were born. However, the history of managed futures products goes back more than 50 years.

The first public futures fund began trading in 1948 and was active until the 1960s. This fund was established before financial futures contracts were invented, and consequently, traded primarily in agricultural commodity futures contracts. The success of this fund spawned other managed futures vehicles, and a new industry was born.

The managed futures industry has grown from just  $1 billion under management in 1985 to$ 35 billion of funds invested in managed futures products in 2000. The stock market's return to more rational pricing in 2000 helped fuel increased interest in managed futures products. Still, managed futures products are a fraction of the estimated size of the hedge fund marketplace of $400 to $500 billion. Yet, issues of capacity are virtually nonexistent in the managed futures industry compared to the hedge fund marketplace where the best hedge funds are closed to new investors.

Similar to hedge funds, CTAs and CPOs charge both management fees and performance fees. The standard "1 and 20" (1\% management fee and 20\% incentive fee) are equally applicable to the managed futures industry although management fees can range from 0\% to 3\% and incentive fees from 10\% to 35\%.

Unfortunately, until the early 1970s, the managed futures industry was largely unregulated. Anyone could advise an investor as to the merits of investing in commodity futures, or form a fund for the purpose of investing in the futures markets. Recognizing the growth of this industry, and the lack of regulation associated with it, in 1974 Congress promulgated the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).


Under the CEA, Congress first defined the terms Commodity Pool Operator and Commodity Trading Advisor. Additionally, Congress established standards for financial reporting, offering memorandum disclosure, and bookkeeping. Further, Congress required CTAs and CPOs to register with the CFTC. Last, upon the establishment of the National Futures Association (NFA) as the designated self-regulatory organization for the managed futures industry, Congress required CTAs and CPOs to undergo periodic educational training.

Today, there are four broad classes of managed futures trading; agricultural products, energy products, financial and metal products, and currency products. Before examining these categories we review the prior research on the managed futures industry.

# PRIOR EMPIRICAL RESEARCH

There are two key questions with respect to managed futures:

1. Will an investment in managed futures improve the performance of an investment portfolio?
2. Can managed futures products produce consistent returns?

The case for managed futures products as a viable investment is mixed. Elton, Gruber, and Rentzler, in three separate studies, examine the returns to public commodity pools. In their first study, they conclude that publicly offered commodity funds are not attractive either as standalone investments or as additions to a portfolio containing stocks and/or bonds. In their second study, they find that the historical return data reported in the prospectuses of publicly offered commodity pools are not indicative of the returns that these funds actually earn once they go public. In fact, they conclude that the performance discrepancies are so large that the prospectus numbers are seriously misleading. In their last study, they did not find any evidence that would support the addition of commodity pools to a portfolio of stocks and bonds and that commodity funds did not provide an attractive hedge against inflation. Last, they find that the distribution of returns to public commodity pools to be negatively skewed. Therefore, the opportunity for very large negative returns is greater than for large positive returns.


Irwin, Krukemeyer, and Zulaf, $^{3}$  Schneeweis, Savanyana, and McCarthy, $^{4}$  and Edwards and Park $^{5}$  also conclude that public commodity funds offer little value to investors as either stand-alone investments or as an addition to a stock and bond portfolio. However, Irwin and Brorsen find that public commodity funds provide an expanded efficient investment frontier. $^{6}$

For private commodity pools, Edwards and Park find that an equally weighted index of commodity pools have a sufficiently high Sharpe Ratio to justify them as either a stand-alone investment or as part of a diversified portfolio. Conversely, Schneeweis et al. conclude that private commodity pools do not have value as stand-alone investments but they are worthwhile additions to a stock and bond portfolio.

With respect to separate accounts managed by CTAs, McCarthy, Schneeweis, and Spurgin find that an allocation to an equally weighted index of CTAs provides valuable diversification benefits to a portfolio of stocks and bonds. In a subsequent study, Schneeweis, Spurgin, and Potter find that a portfolio allocation to a dollar weighted index of CTAs results in a higher portfolio Sharpe ratio. Edwards and Park find that an index of equally weighted CTAs performs well as both a stand-alone investment and as an addition to a diversified portfolio.[11]


An important aspect of any investment is the predictability of returns over time. If returns are predictable, then an investor can select a commodity pool or a CTA with consistently superior performance. Considerable time and effort has been devoted to studying the managed futures industry to determine the predictability and consistency of returns. Unfortunately, the results are not encouraging.

For instance, Edwards and Ma find that once commodity funds go public through a registered public offering, their average returns are negative.[12] They conclude that prior pre-public trading performance for commodity pools is of little use to investors when selecting a public commodity fund as an investment. The lack of predictability in historical managed futures returns is supported by the research of McCarthy, Schneeweis, and Spurgin;[13] Irwin, Zulauf, and Ward;[14] and the three studies by Elton, Gruber, and Renzler.[15] In fact, Irwin et al conclude that a strategy of selecting CTAs based on historical good performance is not likely to improve upon a naive strategy of selecting CTAs at random.

In summary, the prior research regarding managed futures is unsettled. There is no evidence that public commodity pools provide any benefits either as a stand-alone investment or as part of a diversified portfolio. However, the evidence does indicate that private commodity pools and CTA managed accounts can be a valuable addition to a diversified portfolio. Nonetheless, the issue of performance persistence in the managed futures industry is unresolved. Currently, there is more evidence against performance persistence than there is to support this conclusion.

In the next section, we begin to analyze the performance in the managed futures industry by examining the return distributions for different CTA investment styles. We then consider the potential for downside risk protection from managed futures.

# RETURN DISTRIBUTIONS OF MANAGED FUTURES

Similar to our analysis for hedge funds and passive commodity futures, we examine the distribution of returns for managed futures. We use the Barclays Managed Futures Index to determine the pattern of returns associated with several styles of futures investing.

Managed futures products may be good investments if the pattern of their returns is positively skewed. One way to consider this concept is that it is similar to owning a Treasury bill plus a lottery ticket. The investor consistently receives low, but positive returns. However, every once in a while an extreme event occurs and the CTA is able to profit from the movement of futures prices. This would result in a positive skew.

To analyze the distribution of returns associated with managed futures investing, we use the Barclays CTA managed futures indices that divide the CTA universe into four actively traded strategies: (1) CTAs that actively trade in the agricultural commodity futures; (2) CTAs that actively trade in currency futures; (3) CTAs that actively trade in financial and metal futures; and, (4) CTAs that actively trade in energy futures.

Managed futures traders have one goal in mind: to capitalize on price trends. Most CTAs are considered to be trend followers. Typically, they look at various moving averages of commodity prices and attempt to determine whether the price will continue to trend up or down, and then trade accordingly. Therefore, it is not the investment strategy that is the distinguishing factor in the managed futures industry, but rather, the markets in which CTAs and CPOs apply their trend following strategies.[16]

In this chapter we use the Mount Lucas Management Index (MLMI) as a benchmark by which to judge CTA performance. The MLMI is a passive futures index. It applies a mechanical and transparent rule for capitalizing on price trends in the futures markets. It does not represent active trading. Instead, it applies a consistent rule for buying or selling futures contracts depending upon the current price trend in any particular commodity futures market. In addition, the MLMI invests across agricultural, currency, financial, energy, and metal futures contracts. Therefore, it provides a good benchmark by which to examine the four managed futures strategies.

Exhibit 32.1 shows the distribution of returns for the MLMI. The distribution is negatively skewed. Therefore, a simple or naive trend following strategy will produce a distribution of returns that has more neg- ative return observations below the median than positive observations above the median. In reviewing the distribution of returns for managed futures strategies, we keep in mind that the returns are generated from active management. One demonstration of skill is the ability to shift a distribution of returns from a negative skew to a positive skew. Therefore, if CTAs do in fact have skill, we would expect to see distribution of returns with a positive skew.


Further, the passive MLMI strategy produces a distribution of returns with considerable leptokurtosis. This indicates that the tails of the distribution have greater probability mass than a normal, bell-shaped distribution. This indicates that a passive trend following strategy has significant exposure to outlier events. Consequently, we would expect to observe similar leptokurtosis associated with managed futures.

Last, the average return for the MLMI strategy was  $0.73\%$  per month. If managed futures strategies can add value, we would expect them to outperform the average monthly return earned by the naive MLMI strategy.
