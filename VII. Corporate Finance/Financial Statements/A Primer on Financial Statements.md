How much risk is there in this firm, and what is the cost of its debt and equity financing?

As we will see in this chapter, accounting statements allow us to get some information on all of these situations.

At this point we see in our chapter, according which the authors do not get so much information on all of these questions, but risk. In the chapters that follow, we will examine some of the ways in which we can get beyond these limitations.

How Accountants measure earnings

The two basis principles that govern how accountants measure earnings stem to be the following:

The first is the principle of accrual accounting.

Expected to generate benefits over multiple periods; for instance, the cost of buying land and buildings are treated as capital expenses.

<table><tr><td>Item</td><td>Accounting Principles</td><td>Issues in Measurement</td></tr><tr><td>Revenues</td><td>Only revenues from sales during the period, and revenue from sales (i.e., net revenues). These costs, such as fixed sales made in previous periods, are not included in sales, and sales from the current period even if not collected as included.</td><td>• In the case of &quot;average&quot; orders, or where the average is a total amount, it can be posted as the work in completed.• Some firms, to inflate income in the current period, try to record as much as possible on sale before the end of the period.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">(intrinsic) Operating Expenses (not including depreciation)</td><td>These obligations incurred to generate revenue in the current period should be included as part of operating expenses. Labor, material, insurance, administrative costs are all operating expenses. The depreciation expense for the current period is not used in profit or inventory into the next period.</td><td rowspan="2">• Accounting rules require that depreciation and amortization be shown as operating expenses in the period in which they are incurred.• For example, there are no other items that allow for general returns in the current period.• If assets are leased, and the tax (qualifies for treatment as an operating lease), these items are also treated as operating expenses.• Finally, use little depreciation.</td></tr><tr><td>Inventory has to be valued to estimate operating expenses, and firms can choose to value inventory based upon what they paid for the period (IFRS), at the beginning of the period (LIFO) on an average price.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">(intrinsic) Depreciation and Amortization</td><td>Any expense that is expected to generate revenue in the current period is called a capital expense. A capital expense is written off over lifetime, and the write-off cost each year is called depreciation (if it is a finite life). An amortization of it as an intangible income may be recorded.</td><td>• In the US, depreciation has to be reduced to zero, but the depreciation for the asset (book value). In some countries, depreciation has been allowed to revalue assets.• The accounting depreciation may lead little depreciation to the economic depreciation (which measures depreciation due to using the asset).</td></tr><tr><td>Since the value that an asset loses each period is subjective, depreciation is not measured. They can be classified into two groups – straight losses and accumulated losses. The latter is used to measure the different depreciation methods for tax and operating expenses. For tax purposes, they tend to use accelerated depreciation (since a tax loss is not necessarily a cost). For reporting purposes, they tend to use straight for depreciation.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>• Operating Income (EBIT)</td><td>When operating expenses and depreciation are subtracted from operating income, the net income is more easily computed. This is designed to measure the income generated by a firm&#x27;s assets in place.</td><td>• To the extent that R&amp;D expenses are really capital expenses, firms are less likely to have fully financing expenses, and accounting depreciation methods for tax and operating expenses may not account for depreciation, the operating income can be misleading.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">(intrinsic) Interest Repayments</td><td>The most direct source of interest expense for firms either from a direct lender (such as a bank) or from a public interest grant gets written off each period, and the latter is used to obtain the asset grows written off in the earlier period.</td><td rowspan="3">• Interest expenses are tax always available, but their share may be subtracted out to arrive at taxable income.• Some firms have non-tax interest expense, but their share may be deductible; they need to be tracked for cash flow purposes.</td></tr><tr><td>If firms have substantial interest income (i.e., taxes seizures that qualify as capital losses).</td></tr><tr><td>If firms have substantial interest income (i.e., taxes seizures that qualify as capital losses).</td></tr><tr><td>• Taxable Income</td><td>If the depreciation reported in the tax depreciation, setting the interest expense represented in the income should yield the taxable income.</td><td>• To the extent that firms use different approaches for accounting for depreciation (for tax and operating purposes, the latter is preferred), the reported statements will be different and generally higher than the taxable income in the tax books.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">(intrinsic) Taxes</td><td>These are the taxes due and payable only to the current period.

Just adding the share of common stock to the equity options are entitled to a poor way of dealing with them. • Some options hold shares on the equity of the firm.</td></tr><tr><td>• Earnings per Share</td><td>The earnings per share can be reconciled on a primary or fairly diluted basis.</td><td></td></tr></table>

How Accountants Value Assets

The assets of a firm are measured and reported on in a firm's balance sheet. In general, the assets of a firm can be categorized into fixed assets, current assets, intangible assets and financial assets. There seem to be three basic principles that underlie how accountants

sure asset 1

${a}_{i} \in  a\;{a}_{i}$  分母最小值为  $k$  .

An Abihele Belief in Book Value as the Best Estimate of Value: Accounting estimates of asset value begin with the book value, and unless a substantial reason to do otherwise is given, the historical cost is viewed as the best estimate of the value of an asset.

voly and  i be u  t   a. It is better to under estimate value than over estimate it. When there is more than one approach that can be used to value an asset, accounting conversion seems to take the view that the more conservative (lower) estimate of value should be used rather than the

less conservative (higher) estimate of value. Thus, when both market and book value are available for an asset, accounting rules often require that you use the lesser of the two numbers.

The principles governing the accounting measurement of each of these asset categories is provided below:

<table><tr><td>Asset Category</td><td>Description</td><td>Value (in €)</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed Assets</td><td>Fixed assets refer to tangible assets with long lives. Generally accepted accounting principles in the literature state that the asset is a fixed asset or assets at historical states, adjusted for any retained loss as value from the age of the asset. The loss in value is called depreciation.</td><td>• The accounting depreciation of an asset follows mechanisms relative – straight line (where an equal amount is written off each year or accelerated). It bears no resemblance to depreciation.• In the presence of inflation, the asset can be used in similar periods under valuation of older asset. The asset has value little or no further depreciation of the asset.</td></tr><tr><td>Current Assets</td><td>Current assets refer to assets with short lives (generally less than a year). Included here are items representing the history of items that are used and finished goods, accounts receivable and cash.• The accounting conversion is for accounts receivable to be recorded at the end of the firm, based upon the billing at the time of the credit sale. Firms can set aside a portion of their income to cover expected bad debts, from credit sales, and accounts receivable will be reduced by this reserve.• Cash is valued at fair value, and inventory can be viewed as one of these approaches – the cost of the book of inventory (BIO), at the beginning of the period (LIO) or a weighted average.</td><td>• The discussion given forms on valuing inventory and considering expected bad debts does give rise to game playing. During periods of inflation, for instance, from FIEI LIO, there is decrease reported earnings. Furthermore, the balance sheet method only made for reporting purposes. The amount of income the firm nor its cash flows is affected.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Financial Investments</td><td>Financial investments are categorized into three types:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Minority–passive investments where the financial investment in another firm is less than 20% of the ownership of the firm. If this investment is long term, it is recorded at both book value and the interest or dividend from it shows in the income statement. If it is short term, it is marked to market, and the gains or losses recorded each period.• Minority–active investments where the financial investment in another firm is between 20 and 50% of the ownership of the firm. Here, the interest is recorded at the original acquisition cost, but is adjusted back to a proportional share of profits or losses made by the firm each period. (Equity approach)Majority–active investments where the financial investment in another firm is between 50% and 100% of the ownership of the firm. Here, the financial statements of the two firms (assets and liabilities) are consolidated to be consolidated. The entire assets of the two firms (assets and liabilities) are consolidated.</td><td>• Financial investments have an observable market value. When they are measured, the book value is much lower than market value, it does seem to suggest that they are misvaluated.</td></tr><tr><td>Intangible Assets</td><td>When one firm acquires another and the acquired intangible assets are accounted, the difference between the acquisition price and the book value of the acquired firm is calculated. It is amortized over 40 years through the amortization is not tax deductible.• When firms acquire patents or copyright from other companies, the amount of revenue from acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets on the balance sheet. The amortization of these assets is usually tax deductible:</td><td>• Goodwill is not really an asset. The fair value measures assets in place and the market value is a measure of growth and development. This is a measure of growth and development opportunities on acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets. However, it overrepresents more than any intangible assets once acquired.• The treatment of patents as intangibles when they are acquired from companies, patents developed through interest streams, they do not skew up on the balance sheet.</td></tr></table>

How Accountants Value Liabilities

□

The principles that underlie how accountants measure liabilities and equity are the following:

The first It must be

- The firm cannot avoid the obligation, and

The transaction giving rise to the obligation

In keeping with the earlier principles of conservation in cat

to keep  $\mu_{\mathrm{b}}$  with the same principle as in (1.2).

The second principle is that the value of both the liabilities value of liabilities and derivatives is inversely related to the

value of liabilities and equities is technically linked to how they value asset. accounting measurement of both liabilities and equity.

These amounts reflect the actual amounts due, and should be clearly close to market value.’</td><td>‘In general, current liabilities should be recorded at values close to the fair value’</td></tr><tr><td>‘When interest rates increase after long-term debt is issued, the debt reported on the books will be higher than the actual market value and the market value will be lower than market value if interest rates decrease after the debt is borrowed.’</td></tr><tr><td>‘When debt is issued in a foreign currency, the value has to be adjusted to reflect changes in exchange rates.’</td></tr><tr><td>‘When debt is issued in a market value, the value is shown at book value. When it is consumed, it is treated as equity.’</td></tr><tr><td>Other Long Term Liabilities</td><td>There are three primary items that relate to long-term debt for treatment as capital leases, the future value of long-term debt, as shown as long-term debt. Second, if the future value of long-term debt is healthcare claims underlined the understanding is shown as a long-term debt limit. Third, if the debt is managed to adjust taxes on income tax expense (including accelerated depreciation and amortization) or valuation adjustments (in methods), the deferred taxes is shown as a liability.’</td><td>‘These long term liabilities, unlike long-term debt, are not directly used for financial purposes. While they may represent liabilities in the short-term, the absence of a cash flow claim implies that we should be able to determine whether there is a future amount that is not also clear what claims these claim holders would have if, the firm failed to meet obligations.</td></tr><tr><td>Preferred Stock</td><td>Preferred stock represents shares with a fixed市值. In some cases, the dividend is cumulated and paid. If the premium is set to zero, preferred stock is valued at market value, with any assumed surplus dividend available. Cumulative preferred stock is treated similarly but it is treated as equity on consideration of equity.’</td><td>‘Accountholders have historically traded preferred stock as quasi-equity or even in equity. They rest their arguments on the basis of the market value of the preferred stock, which cannot force a firm into default, and that if it has no market value, they must also analyse, prefer stock looks like very expensive, unsecured debt.’</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Common Equity</td><td rowspan="2">The accounting measure of equity is based on the equity share of a company’s equity share on the balance sheet reflects the original proceeds received by the firm when it issued the equity, aggregated by any transactions with other companies, and retained losses (if any) and reduced by any period dividends paid out during the period.</td><td>‘When companies buy back stock for reasons other than the value of equity, it increases the stock or using it to cover option exercises, they are allowed to show the stock as a treasury stock, which reduces the book value of the equity. This means that the stock is now a valuable source of treasury stock on the books for extended period, and have to reduce their book value of equity. The value of repurchased stock in the case of actions such as stock buybacks occurs at the current market price, their can be used to reduce the value of stock buybacks occur on the market value of equity.’</td></tr><tr><td>‘If firms that have significant losses over extended periods or carry out massive stock buybacks can end up with negative book values of equity.’</td></tr></table>

How Accountants Measure Profitability

While the income statement allows us to estimate how profitable a firm in absolute terms, it is just as important that we gauge the profitability of the firm in terms of percentage returns. There are two basic gauges used to measure profitability. One is to examine the

The profitability relative to the capital employed to get a rate of return on investment. This can be done either from the viewpoint of jobs or from the viewpoint of profits.

The return on equity, for example, may be calculated for those firms.</td></tr><tr><td>Net Margin</td><td>Net Income / Sales</td></tr><tr><td>Operating Margin</td><td>EBIT (-1-tax rate)/Sales</td></tr></table>

In Summary

Financial statements remain the primary source of information for most investors and analysts. While an understanding of every detail and FASB rule may not be necessary, it is important that the basics be understood. This primer attempts to explain the basics of financial statements and the generally accepted accounting principles that underlie their construction, and the various financial ratios that often accompany financial analyses. As long as there is a recognition that financial statements and financial ratios are a means to
