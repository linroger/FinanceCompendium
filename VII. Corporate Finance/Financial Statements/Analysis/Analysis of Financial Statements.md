# Preface
In _Analysis of Financial Statements, Third Edition_, we introduce you to the tools and techniques of financial analysis. We provide a foundation for financial analysis with the goal of assisting you in the analysis of the financial condition and operating performance of a company.
This book was first published in 1999. The most significant difference between the previous two editions and this third edition is the role of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which affects disclosures and regulation of many entities and brought attention to the importance of credit analysis. We have incorporated the changes from the Dodd-Frank Act throughout this book—and we emphasize, too, the importance of assessing the quality of financial data.
Although it is important to understand how to calculate financial ratios, look at trends, use credit models, and the like, it is even more important to understand the data that you are working with. The recent financial crisis, which tested the financial condition and performance of companies, has brought to the forefront the need to understand the quality of the data as well as the risk.
Financial analysis and the reliance on financial data quality are important for both traditional fundamental equity investing and quantitative equity investing—the two major styles of equity investing. In traditional fundamental equity investing, a portfolio manager—and any like analyst— begins with a broad universe of stocks and screens those stocks to a smaller group for further analysis based on certain criteria such as earnings growth, profit margins, and market share. The portfolio manager analyzes a smaller group of stocks using the techniques described in this book in consultation with a team of equity analysts. Thus, the need to understand the economic meaning of financial data, and whether adjustments must be made, are required at both levels of analysis by the portfolio manager, who follows a fundamental equity investing approach—that is, the screening and valuation analysis of individual stocks. With quantitative equity investing, the portfolio manager uses financial data to build a statistical model of stock valuation, whose explanatory variables are obtained from financial and economic data, and then applies the model to a broad universe of stocks.
The focus is on determining the financial and economic variables that should be included in the model. The portfolio manager then uses the model to select stocks. Understanding the financial data is, of course, paramount in this approach even if individual stocks are not analyzed in detail.
We structure this book into three parts:
In Part One, we introduce you to financial analysis, discuss the available financial information, and then focus on the quality of the information.
In Part Two, we present different ways of analyzing financial data, including financial ratios and cash flow analysis. We also discuss the pitfalls that you may encounter in financial analysis, citing numerous actual cases to illustrate these pitfalls.
In Part Three, we apply the financial analysis tools developed in Part
Two to equity valuation, credit analysis, and fundamental factor models.
We close the book with a recap of the lessons that we have learned.
New to the third edition of _Analysis of Financial Statements_ are the 10 multiple choice questions that appear at the end of each chapter, which allows you to assess your comprehension of the important topics discussed before going on to the next chapter. The answer key is provided at the end
- f the book.

# Part One The Basics
# CHAPTER 1 Introduction
The investments arena is large, complex, and dynamic. These characteristics make it interesting to study, but also make it challenging to keep up. What changes? Laws and regulations, the introduction of new types of securities, innovations in markets and trading, company events
(such as the passing of the CEO or a settlement of a lawsuit), and a persistently changing economy to name a few. Add to this mix the political, technological, and environmental changes that occur throughout the world every day, and you have quite a task to understand investment opportunities and investment management.
There is a wealth of financial information about companies available to financial analysts and investors. The popularity of the Internet as a source
- f information has made vast amounts of information available to everyone, displacing print as a means of communication. Consider the amount of information available about Microsoft Corporation. Not only can investors find annual reports, quarterly reports, press releases, and links to the companies' filings with regulators on Microsoft's web site, anyone can download data for analysis in spreadsheet form and can listen in on
Microsoft's management's conversations with analysts.
The availability and convenience of information has eased the datagathering task of financial analysis. What remains, however, is the more challenging task of analyzing this information in a meaningful way. Recent scandals involving financial disclosures increase the importance of knowing just how to interpret financial information. In response to these scandals,
Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002, which increases the responsibility of publicly traded corporations, accounting firms
1 performing audits, company management, and financial analysts  And while this Act is an attempt to restore faith in financial disclosures, investors and analysts must still be diligent in interpreting financial data in a meaningful way.
This need for diligence is evident in the financial crisis of 2007–2008, which tested analysts' and investors' abilities to understand complex securities and their accounting representation. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) passed in 2010 in response to the crisis, added requirements pertaining to corporate governance, security regulation, the regulation of the financial services
 industry, and consumer protections And, while there will likely be additional disclosures of some of the more complex instruments as a result
- f this act, financial instruments are constantly evolving, and analysts and investors have to stay abreast of these innovations and their implications for analysis.
The purpose of this book is to assist the analyst and investor in understanding financial information and using this information in an effective manner.
## WHAT IS FINANCIAL ANALYSIS?
Our focus in this book is on _financial analysis_, which is the selection, evaluation, and interpretation of financial data and other pertinent information to assist in evaluating the operating performance and financial condition of a company. The operating performance of a company is a measure of how well a company has used its resources—its assets, both tangible and intangible, to produce a return on its investment. The financial condition of a company is a measure of its ability to satisfy its obligations, such as the payment of interest on its debt in a timely manner.
Financial reporting is the collection and presentation of current and historical financial information of a company. This reporting includes the annual reports sent to shareholders, the filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) for publicly traded companies, and press releases and other reports made by the company. Financial analysis takes that information—and much more—and makes sense out of it in terms of what it says about the company's past performance and condition and, more importantly, what it says about the company's future performance and condition.
The financial analyst must determine what information to analyze (e.g., financial reports, market information, economic information) and how much information (5 years? 10 years?) to review. The analyst must sift through the vast amount of information, selecting the information that is most important in assessing the company's current and future performance and condition. A part of this analysis requires the analyst to assess the quality of the information. Though publicly traded companies must report their financial information according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), there is still some leeway that the reporting company has within these principles. The analyst must understand the extent of this leeway and what this implies for the company's future performance.
The analyst has many tools available in the analysis of financial information. These tools include financial ratio analysis and quantitative analysis. The key to analysis, however, is understanding how to use these tools in the most effective manner.
What happens if we're not looking closely at financial information? Lots.
Several of the scandals that arose in the past few years were actually detectable using basic financial analysis and common sense. It is not possible to spot all cases of fraud and manipulation, but there are some telltale signs that should raise caution flags in analysis. Examples of these signs include:
Revenue growth that is out of line with others in the same industry or not reasonable given the current economic climate.
Profits that are increasing at a much faster rate than cash flows generated from operations.
Debt disappearing from the balance sheet.
### Example: Enron
Consider Enron Corporation, which filed for bankruptcy in 2001 following a financial-reporting scandal. Enron's revenues grew from a little over
\$9.1 billion to over \$100 billion in the 10-year period from 1995 through
2000 as we show in Exhibit 1.1; in other words, its revenues grew at an average rate of over 61\% per year. During this period, Enron's debts grew too, from 76\% of its assets to over 82\% of its assets. Enron experienced significant growth and reported significant debt, becoming one of the largest corporations in the United States within 15 years of becoming a publicly traded corporation.
EXHIBIT 1.1 Enron's Revenues, 1995–2000
_Source of data:_ Enron, Inc. 10-K filings, various years.
An interesting aspect of Enron's growth is that the company produced revenues far in excess of what other companies of similar size could produce. For example, in 2000, Enron produced over \$5 million in revenues per employee, whereas Exxon Mobil could only produce \$2 million per
 employee and General Electric only 0.4 million per employee
Enron became embroiled in an accounting scandal that involved, in part, removing debt from its balance sheet into special purpose entities. While the scandal proved shocking, Enron had actually provided information in its financial disclosures that hinted at the problems. Enron disclosed in footnotes to its 2000 10-K filing that it had formed wholly owned and majority-owned limited partnerships “for the purpose of holding 1.6 billion of assets contribute by Enron.” [Enron 10-K, 2000] The result?
**1.** Assets and liabilities of Enron did not appear directly in its balance sheet.
**2.** Gains on Enron stock invested in by these partnerships found their way to Enron's income statement.
The most notorious deal involved Joint Energy Development Investment
Limited Partnership II (JEDI II). Enron executives created this partnership using Enron funds and loans fed through Chewco Investments. Though accounted for as a special purpose entity (SPE), and hence its assets and liabilities were removed from Enron's balance sheet, there was insufficient independent ownership of the entity to qualify JEDI II as a SPE because

Chewco was, essentially, Enron
In all of this, keep in mind that Enron left a trail for the analyst to find in the filings of Enron and these entities. The limited partnerships and their relation to Enron were reported in the footnotes to Enron's filings and in
- ther filings with the SEC. Not all the pieces were there, but enough to raise concerns.
### Example: AIG
As another example, consider AIG, an insurance company that settled a case of fraud in 2010 after six years for 725 million. Along with anticompetitive charges and stock price manipulation, AIG was accused of accounting manipulations perpetrated between 1999 and 2005 that inflated its claims reserves by reporting what was, essentially, a deposit with a
5 reinsurance company as a reinsurance transaction  The result of this inflation represented that it had more assets available to meet claims than it actually had, making itself look more profitable and less risky. As you can see in Exhibit 1.2, AIG reported underwriting profits instead of losses in
2000 and 2001, which then overstated net income, especially in 2000 and
EXHIBIT 1.2 AIG Profits, 2000–2004
_Source of data:_ AIG 10-K filings with the SEC, various years.
Were there bread crumbs to follow? A few. First, AIG was known for its
- paque accounting:
It's been an open secret for years on Wall Street that no one outside the company really understood its accounting. AIG has long been called
“opaque” on Wall Street, which is what analysts say when they can't

figure out a company's books because much of the detail is off the books
Second, reinsurance accounting at the time was murky, so the arrangement with General Re, which involved an unusual insurance product that increased AIG's loss reserves to acceptable levels, should have raised questions. The particular ‘insurance’ product itself was unusual.
A typical insurance product involves the insurance company receiving a periodic premium to insure for a particular type of loss (e.g., some sort of casualty). If a loss does not occur, the insurance company comes out ahead; if a loss event occurs, the insured is protected from loss by the insurance company. The AIG contract was a bit different: A multiyear insurance contract, with the premium up front that would cover most or all of the potential losses, with any unused premium refunded at the end of the contract. This AIG product is more of a loan than it is an insurance contract, which would require different accounting. However, AIG reported the
 proceeds from this product as insurance, not as a loan
Following the bread crumbs should have at least raised concerns about the financial performance and financial condition of AIG. And opaque accounting should be a significant crumb to follow.
## WHERE DO WE FIND THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION?
There are many sources of information available to analysts and investors.
One source of information is the company itself, preparing documents for regulators and distribution to shareholders. Another source is information prepared by government agencies that compile and report information about industries and the economy. Still another source is information prepared by financial service firms that compile, analyze, and report financial and other information about the company, the industry, and the economy.
The basic information about a company can be gleaned from publications
(both print and Internet), annual reports, and sources such as the federal government and commercial financial information providers. The basic information about a company consists of the following:
Type of business (e.g., manufacturer, retailer, service, utility).
Primary products.
Strategic objectives.
Financial condition and operating performance.
Major competitors (domestic and foreign).
Degree of competitiveness of the industry (domestic and foreign).
Position of the company in the industry (e.g., market share).
Industry trends (domestic and foreign).
Regulatory issues (if applicable).
Corporate governance.
Economic environment.
Recent and planned acquisitions and divestitures.
A thorough financial analysis of a company requires examining events that help explain the company's present condition and effect on its future prospects. For example, did the company recently incur some extraordinary losses? Is the company developing a new product, or acquiring another company? Current events can provide useful information to the analyst.
A good place to start is with the company itself and the disclosures that it makes—both financial and otherwise. Most of the company-specific information for a publicly traded company can be picked up through company annual reports, press releases, and other information that the company provides to inform investors and customers. Information about competitors and the markets for the company's products must be determined through familiarity with the products of the company and its competitors.
Information about the economic environment can be found in many available sources. We take a brief look at the different types of information in the remainder of this chapter.
## WHO GETS WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION AND WHEN?
### Disclosures Required by Regulatory Authorities
Companies whose stock is traded in public markets are subject to a number
- f securities laws that require specific disclosures. We list several of these securities laws in Exhibit 1.3.
Publicly traded companies are required by these securities laws to disclose information through filings with the SEC, the federal agency that administers federal securities laws.

The SEC, by law, has the authority to specify accounting principles for corporations under its jurisdiction. The SEC has largely delegated this responsibility to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). While recognizing the FASB Accounting Standards Codification as authoritative, the SEC also issues accounting rules, often dealing with supplementary disclosures  8

Therefore, the financial information provided in the company's

10-K filing is more comprehensive than that provided in its annual report provided to shareholders.

### Form 10-K

The Form 10-K filing contains the information provided in the annual report (that is, balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, statement of stockholders' equity, and footnotes), plus additional disclosures, such as the management discussion and analysis (MDA). For most large corporations, the 10-K must be filed within 60 days after close of

 a corporation's fiscal year We provide a list of the required disclosures for

Form 10-K in Exhibit 1.5, as identified using the SEC's numbering system

- f requirements. The disclosure requirements in the 10-K have changed
- ver time as the SEC seeks additional information from companies regarding risk, internal controls, and the company's auditing firm.
**EXHIBIT 1.5** Required Disclosures of the Form 10-K Filing
**13.** Certain relationships and related transactions
**14.** Principal accounting fees and services
**15.** Exhibits and financial statement schedules
The MDA is generally viewed as an important disclosure, providing additional transparency of financial statements. In the MDA, which is Item
7 of a company's 10-K filing, the company's management provides a discussion of risks, trends, unusual or infrequent events, and uncertainties that pertain to the company and is a useful device for management to explain the financial results in terms of the company's strategies, recent actions (e.g., mergers) and the company's competitors. We summarize the
Item 7 items in Exhibit 1.6.
**EXHIBIT 1.6** Required Discussion in Item 7 of the 10-K MD&A
**1.** Liquidity
**2.** Capital resources
**3.** Known material trends
**4.** Results of operations, including unusual or infrequent events or economic changes, known trends and uncertainties, discussion of any material change in revenues, and impact of inflation
**5.** Off-balance sheet arrangements, including the business purpose and importance
**6.** Contractual obligations, including leases
In addition, the company's management must provide a discussion of significant components of revenues and expenses that are important in understanding the company's results of operations. The MDA also provides information that may help reconcile previous years' financial results with the current year's results. The MDA must also provide additional information about off-balance sheet arrangements, as well as a table that
 discloses contractual obligations As a result of rulemaking arising from the
Dodd-Frank Act, companies are required to disclose additional information, including information on liquidity, capital resources, and shortterm borrowing.
### Form 10-Q

A similar form, Form 10-Q, must be filed within 35 days after close of a

 corporation's fiscal quarter This filing is similar to the 10-K, yet there is

Exhibit 1.7.

much less detailed information, as you can see in

**EXHIBIT 1.7** Required Disclosures of the Form 10-Q Filing

**Part I**

**1.** Financial statements

**2.** Management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations

**3.** Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

**4.** Legal proceedings

**2.** Unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds

**3.** Defaults upon senior securities

**4.** Submission of matters to a vote of security holders

**5.** Other information

**6.** Exhibits

### Form 8-K

The 8-K statement is an occasional filing that provides useful information about the company that is not generally found in the financial statements. A company files the 8-K statement within four business days of the event.

There are currently 22 specific events for which a company is required to file the 8-K statement, as we detail in Exhibit 1.8.12 Previous to the SOX Act and the resulting SEC rules, the company was required to file an 8-K for any of eight events. The SOX Act shifted four additional requirements from the 10-K disclosures and added eight additional events.

**EXHIBIT 1.8** Events Requiring Discloser of 8-K

### Proxy Statement

In addition to the financial statement and management discussion information available in the periodic 10-Q and 10-K filings, companies provide useful non-financial information in proxy statements. The _proxy_

_statement_ is the company's notification to the shareholders of matters to be voted upon at a shareholders' meeting. The proxy statement provides an array of information on issues such as:

The reappointment of the independent auditor.

Compensation (salary, bonus, and options) of the top five executives and the stock ownership of executives and directors.

Detailed information about proposals subject to a vote by the shareholders.

### Other Filings

In addition, when a corporation offers a new security to the public, the SEC requires that the corporation prepare and file a registration statement. The registration statement presents financial statement data, along with detailed information about the new security. A condensed version of this statement, referred to as a _prospectus_, is made available to potential investors.

### Documents Distributed to Shareholders

The objective of financial reporting is to provide information that is useful to present and potential investors and creditors and other users in making

13 rational investment, credit, and similar decisions

With that objective in mind, the financial reports prepared and distributed by the company should help users in assessing “the amounts, timing and uncertainty of prospective net cash inflows of the enterprise.  14 Therefore, uncertainty of prospective net cash inflows of the enterprise.  14 Therefore, the financial reports to shareholders are not simply a presentation of the basic financial statements—the balance sheet, the income statement, the statement of cash flows, and the statement of stockholders' equity—but also a devise to communicate additional nonfinancial information, such as information about the relevant risks and uncertainties of the company. To that end, recent changes in accounting standards have broadened the extent and type of the information presented within the financial statements and in notes to the financial statements. For example, companies are now required to disclose risks and uncertainties related to their operations, how they use estimates in the preparation of financial statements, and the vulnerability of

 the company to geographic and customer concentrations

The annual report is the principal document used by corporations to communicate with shareholders. It is not an official SEC filing; consequently, companies have significant discretion in deciding on what types of information is reported and the way it is presented. The annual report presents the financial statements, notes to these statements, a discussion of the company by management, the report of the independent accountants, and financial information on operating segments, product and

 services, geographical areas, and major customers Along with this basic information, annual reports may present 5or 10-year summaries of key financial data, quarterly data, and other descriptions of the business or its products.

### Issues

There are a number of issues that should be considered in using the financial statement data provided in company annual and quarterly reports.

We discuss many of these issues in later chapters that focus on financial analysis, cash flow analysis, and earnings quality.

Consider the following examples:

The restatement of prior years' data.

The different accounting standards used by non-U.S. companies.

There may be “off-balance sheet” activity.

#### The Restatement of Prior Years' Data

When a company reports financial data for more than one year, which is

- ften the case, previous years' financial data is restated to reflect any changes in accounting methods or acquisitions that have taken place since the previous data had been reported. Consider a company that restates its
2010 income statement when it changes an accounting method in 2011. If, for example, the analyst were looking at the company and its competitive position in 2010, the analyst would want to use the as-reported 2010 data.
If, on the other hand, the analyst is looking at trends in some of the data in an effort to forecast future performance or conditions, the restated 2010 data is more appropriate.
#### The Different Accounting Standards Used by Non-U.S. Companies

Another concern is dealing with financial statements of non-U.S. reporting entities. There are several reasons for this concern. First, as of this writing, there are no internationally acceptable standards of financial reporting. This includes not only the accounting methods that are acceptable for handling certain economic transactions and the degree of disclosure, but other issues.

Specifically, there is no uniform treatment of the frequency of disclosure.

Some countries require only annual or semiannual reporting rather than quarterly as in the United States.

There is an effort to “harmonize” accounting standards around the world, to make statements more comparable. The International Accounting

Standards Board (IASB) and the FASB are working toward the development of international accounting standards. In addition, the IASB and the FASB have agreed to produce joint pronouncements regarding new accounting standards. Beginning January 1, 2005, most companies listed in the European Union (EU) were required to prepare their financial statements according to the International Financial Reporting Standards

(IFRS), which are promulgated by the IASB. The adoption of IFRS, along with the convergence of the standards of IASB and FASB, are significant

 strides toward consistent international accounting standards

#### There May Be “Off-Balance Sheet” Activity

There is always some investment or financing activity that simply does not show up in financial statements. Though there have been improvements in accounting standards that have moved much of this activity to the financial statements (e.g., leases, pension benefits, postretirement benefits, asset retirement obligations), opportunities remain to conduct business that is not represented adequately in the financial statements. An example is the case

- f joint ventures. As long as the investing corporation does not have a controlling interest in the joint venture, the assets and financing of the venture can remain off of the balance sheet. Limited information is provided in notes to the statements, but this information is insufficient to adjudge the performance and risks of the joint venture.
The opportunity to keep some information from the financial statements places a greater burden on the financial analyst to dig deep into the company's notes to the financial statements, filings with the SEC, and the financial press.
### Interviewing Company Representatives

Interviewing representatives of a company may produce additional information and insight into the company's business. The starting place for the interview is the company's investors' relations (IR) office, which is generally well prepared to address the analyst's questions.

The key is for the analyst to do his or her homework before meeting with the IR officer so that the interview questions can be well focused. This preparation includes understanding the company's business, its products, the industry in which it operates, and its recent financial disclosures. The analyst must understand the industry-specific terminology and any industryspecific accounting methods. In the telecommunications industry, for example, the analyst must understand measures such as gigahertz and minutes-in-use, and such terms as bandwidth, point-of-presence, and

 spectrum As another example, an analyst for the oil and gas industry should understand that a degree-day is a measure of temperature variation from a reference temperature.

The analyst must keep in mind that the IR officer has an obligation to treat all investors in a fair manner, which means that the IR officer cannot give a financial analyst material information that is not also available to

- thers. There is also information that the IR officer cannot give the analyst.
For example, in a very competitive industry it may not be appropriate to give monthly sales figures for specific products. The analyst must understand the competitive nature of the industry and understand what information is typically not revealed in the industry.
Because the analyst comes armed with knowledge of the company's financial statements, the questions should focus on taking a closer look at the information provided by these disclosures:
Extraordinary or unusual revenues and expenses.
Large differences between earnings from cash flows.
Changes in how data is reported.
Explanations for deviations from consensus earnings expectations.
How the company values itself versus the market's valuation.
Sales to major customers.
An analyst that uses a statistical model to develop forecasts for the company or its industry may, of course, require very specific data that may not be readily available in the financial statements.
It is sometimes useful to determine what the company expects to earn in the future. Though companies may be reluctant to provide a specific earnings forecast, they will sometimes respond to a query regarding analysts' consensus earnings forecasts. In their response about analysts' forecasts, the company may reveal their own forecast. If a company provides a forecast of its earnings, the analyst must consider the forecast in light of the company's previous forecasting; for example, some companies may consistently underestimate future earnings in order to avoid a negative earnings surprise. Further, the company's forecast or response to a consensus forecast might be accompanied by significant defensive disclosures that concern the risks that the company may not meet projected earnings.
### Regulation FD

In an attempt to “level the playing field,” the SEC in 2000 adopted new rules regarding selective disclosure.19 These rules, in the form of the Fair

Disclosure regulation, are referred to as Regulation FD. Basically, if a publicly traded company or anyone acting on its behalf makes material, nonpublic information available to certain persons, the company must make a _public_ disclosure of this information. All intentional disclosures must be made simultaneously to the public. If someone makes an _un_ intentional disclosure, the company is required to make a prompt, public disclosure of the information.

### Information Prepared by Government Agencies

Federal and state governmental agencies provide a wealth of information that may be useful in analyzing a company, its industry, or the economic environment.

### Company-Specific Information

One the most prominent innovations in the delivery of company information is the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering and Retrieval (EDGAR)

[system that is available on the Internet (www.sec.gov). The EDGAR system](http://www.sec.gov/) provides on-line access to most SEC filings for all public domestic companies from 1994 forward. The EDGAR system provides real-time access to filings, providing up-to-date information accessible to everyone.

In addition to the EDGAR system at the SEC site, several financial service companies provide free or fee access to the information in the

EDGAR system in different database forms that assist in searching or database creation tasks  20

### Industry Data

The analysis of a company requires that the analyst look at the other firms that operate in the same line of business. The purpose of examining these

- ther companies is to get an idea of the market in which the company's products are sold: What is the degree of competition? What are the trends?
What is the financial condition of the company's competitors?
Several government agencies provide information that is useful in an analysis of an industry. The primary governmental providers of industry data are the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Economic
Analysis, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce. A recent innovation is the creation of Stat-USA, a fee-based collection of governmental data. Stat-USA is an electronic provider of industry and sector data that are produced by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The available data provided for different industries include gross domestic product, shipments of products, inventories, orders, and plant capacity utilization  21
The government classification of businesses into industries is based on

Classification (SIC) system in 1997, though many analysts and data

 providers continue to use the SIC system The NAICS is a six-digit system that classifies businesses using 350 different classes. The broadest classification comprises the first two digits of the six-digit code and is listed in Exhibit 1.9. The NAICS is now the basis for the classification of industry-specific data produced by governmental agencies. Like the SIC system before it, the NAICS will, over time, become the basis for the classification of companies for industry-specific data used by nongovernmental information providers as well.

### Economic Data

Another source of information for financial analysis is economic data, such as the gross domestic product and consumer price index, which may be useful in assessing the recent performance or future prospects of a firm or industry. For example, suppose you are evaluating a firm that owns a chain

- f retail outlets. What information do you need to judge the firm's performance and financial condition? You need financial data, but they do not tell the whole story. You also need information on consumer spending, producer prices, and consumer prices. These economic data are readily

### Information Prepared by Financial Service Companies

A whole industry exists to provide financial and related information about individual companies, industries, and the economy. The ease and low cost

- f providing such data on the Internet has fostered a proliferation of information providers. However, the prominent providers in today's
Internet-based world are some of the same providers that were prominent in print medium.
### Company-Specific Information

Information about an individual company is available from a vast number

- f sources, including the company itself through its own web pages. In addition to relaying the company's financial information that is presented by the company through its communication with shareholders and regulators, there are many financial service firms that compile the financial data and present analyses.
Exhibit 1.11.
We list several sources of data on individual companies in
This is by no means an exhaustive listing because of the large and evergrowing number of information providers. The providers distinguish themselves in the market for information through the breadth of coverage
(in terms of the number of companies in their data base), the depth of coverage (in terms of the extensive nature of their data for individual companies), or their specialty (e.g., the collection of analyst recommendations and forecasts). These resources are available online, some free and some fee-based.

A number of financial information providers offer industry-specific data and compile financial data by industry. Some services, such as Standard &

Poor's Compustat, SNL Financial, and Value Line, provide industry data based on their large universe of companies covered in their database of individual company financial data.

### Economic Data

Much of the economic data that are used in financial analysis are taken from government sources, though some information is independently produced through surveys and research.

There are many commercial services that collect and disseminate this and

- ther information. These services include:
[AP Business News (www.ap.org)](http://www.ap.org/)
[Thomson Reuters (www.reuters.com)](http://www.reuters.com/)
[Business Wire (www.businesswire.com)](http://www.businesswire.com/)

_Investors.com_ [(www.investors.com)](http://www.investors.com/)
_Financial Times_ [(www.ft.com)](http://www.ft.com/)
[In addition, databases, such as the HIS Global Insight (www.ihs.com),](http://www.ihs.com/)
- ffer historical series of economic and financial data.
Government and organizations' databases provide economic data, including:

World Bank (data.worldbank.org)
[International Monetary Fund (IMF) (www.imf.org)](http://www.imf.org/)
[Eurostat (ec.europa.eu/Eurostat/)](http://ec.europa.eu/Eurostat/)
The continued globalization of financial systems results in the growing availability of economic and financial data.
## WHAT DOES SARBANES-OXLEY MEAN TO COMPANIES AND INVESTORS?

The financial scandals that arose recently created problems in terms of the public's confidence in the capital markets, companies' financial disclosures, and the reliance on the auditing by public accounting firms. In response to this lack of confidence, the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002 was passed in mid-2002  24 ~~T~~ he SOX act has changed the landscape with respect to financial disclosures, corporate governance, auditing, and penalties for financial misdeeds. We provide a list of key provisions that affect financial

|Title<br>III|Corporate Responsibility<br>Requires that members of the client's audit committee be independent (i.e., not an<br>employee of the client or consultant or advisor other than in capacity as a member of the<br>board of directors.) [Sec. 301].<br>Requires certification of the annual and quarterly filings with the SEC by the chief<br>financial officer and the chief executive officer, attesting to the internal controls of the<br>firms [Sec. 302].<br>Prohibits improper influence on audits [Sec. 303].<br>Specifies forfeiture of bonuses and profits on securities in the event of financial<br>restatements [Sec. 304].<br>Prohibits insider trading during pension fund blackouts and requires sufficient<br>communication to fund participants and beneficiaries in the event of a blackout period<br>[Sec. 306].|

|Title<br>V|Analyst Conflicts of Interest<br>Increase the independence of analysts and investment banking activities and requires<br>disclosure of potential conflicts of interest of analysts [Sec. 501].|
|Title<br>VIII|Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability<br>Imposes criminal penalties for destruction of documents [Sec. 802].<br>Provides whistleblower protection in fraud actions. [Sec. 806].<br>Provides criminal penalties for defrauding shareholders. [Sec. 807].|
|Title<br>IX|White-Collar Crime Penalty Enhancements<br>Provides increased criminal penalties for white-collar crimes, such as mail and wire<br>fraud [Sec. 902].<br>Imposes criminal penalties for false certification of financial reports [Sec. 906].|
|Title<br>XI|Corporate Fraud and Accountability<br>Imposes fines and possible imprisonment for tampering with documents in an<br>investigation [Sec. 1102].|

### Auditors

The role of the auditing accounting firm is to attest to whether the client company is providing financial statements that are prepared consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. Consider the Supreme Court of

: the United States opinion in the case of _United States v. Arthur Young_

This “public watchdog” function demands that the accountant maintain total independence from the client at all times and requires complete fidelity to the public trust. … Public faith in the reliability of a corporation's financial statements depends upon the public perception of the outside auditor as an independent professional. … If investors were to view the auditor as an advocate for the corporate client, the value of the

 audit function itself might well be lost

The establishment of an oversight board for accounting firms and the requirements pertaining to auditor independence are in response to the problems encountered when the relationship between the auditor and the audit client becomes too close, inhibiting the audit firm from being the

“public watchdog” of the client's compliance with generally accepted accounting principles. Consider the case of Enron Corporation discussed earlier in this chapter. In 2000, the year before the scandal erupted, Enron paid its auditing accounting firm a total of \$52 million in fees: \$25 million

 for audit services and 27 million for consulting services

### Corporate Responsibility

There are a number of provisions in the SOX act that affect the responsibilities of publicly traded corporations and build upon previous attempts to strengthen the role of the audit committee, which is a committee

27 comprised of members of the company's board of directors  The SOX act provisions affect the corporate governance with respect to the composition

- f the audit committee that has responsibilities related to financial reporting, monitoring choices of accounting policies, monitoring the internal control process, and overseeing the engagement and performance
- f the auditors.
In addition to the enhanced role of the audit committee, the SOX act and subsequently issued rules prohibit insider trading during a pension blackout
 period A blackout period is a period of time in which participants in a
 period A blackout period is a period of time in which participants in a participant-directed pension plan cannot trade employer securities. This is, again, a response to problems observed at firms involved in scandals in which the executives were able to sell their stock in the company before the
 company's demise, but other employees were not able to do so
### Financial Disclosures

Financial disclosures were enhanced in three ways with the SOX act. First, more information must be disclosed regarding off-balance sheet transactions. Second, companies are required to reconcile pro forma financial information with financial information determined using generally accepted accounting principles. Pro forma results are financial statement information, such as earnings, that are calculated by the company using

 their own creative approach to accounting

In addition, companies must now make disclosures regarding the corporation's governance, such as whether there is a financial expert on the audit committee, and whether there is a code of ethics for financial officers.

Further, there are greater restrictions on loans to executives.

### Analysts

There is a potential for a conflict of interest in the case of financial analysts that are employed by firms that perform investment banking functions. One

- f the important functions of an investment banking firm is to help companies bring stock and bond issues to the market, providing capital for corporations. If the investment banking part of the company is not sufficiently independent of the financial analysts of the same company, who may be making stock or bond recommendations, there is a potential for biased ratings on the stock or bond issue.
The goal of the analyst provisions in the SOX act, among other actions taken by the SEC, is to insure that there is no link between the investment
 banking and the financial analyst functions within a company
### Accountability

There are a number of deterrents to financial fraud included in the SOX act.

There are criminal penalties included for defrauding shareholders, destroying documents, false certification of financial reports, and mail fraud. There is also increased protection of whistleblowers. Many of the expanded criminal penalties are the direct result of recent scandals.

## WHAT DOES THE DODD-FRANK ACT MEAN FOR COMPANIES AND INVESTORS?

We summarize the provisions of the 2010 financial reform act by section in

Exhibit 1.14.

Much of the act focuses on the stability of the financial system, especially in an attempt to prevent a similar, significant financial crisis that affects the economy to the extent of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Titles I, II, III, V, VI, and XI of this act focus primarily on changes in the regulation of financial services firms. The act is designed to end the government bailouts for firms that are “too big to fail” by requiring institutions to have more capital (which acts as a safety-net), identifying troubled institutions in advance, and providing for a liquidation of a troubled financial institution.

|EXHIBIT 1.14 Key Provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act|Col2|
|---|---|
|||
|Title<br>I|Financial Stability Creates the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which has members<br>representing the primary financial regulators, including the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the<br>Comptroller of the Currency, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Creates the<br>Office of Financial Research, which analyzes and reports on the financial services industry,<br>especially those firms that may have a significant effect on the economy.|
|Title<br>II|Orderly Liquidation Authority Establishes the FDIC as the primary authority for liquidating a<br>troubled financial institution. Advised by the Financial Stability Oversight Council.|
|Title<br>III|Transfer Power to the Comptroller, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve Dissolving the Office<br>of Thrift Supervision, transferring its responsibilities to other regulators.|
|Title<br>IV|Regulation of Advisers to Hedge funds and Others Increase reporting of investment advisors.<br>Redefines “accredited investor.” Requires studies on accredited investor requirements, self-|
|Col1|regulatoryauthorityforprivatefunds andshortselling<br>, .|

|Title<br>V|Insurance Creates the Federal Insurance Office, which monitors insurance companies and<br>coordinates with state regulators.|
|Title<br>VI|Improvements to Regulation Reduces the participation of banking institutions in hedge funds<br>and private equity funds.|
|Title<br>VII|Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Increases the regulation of credit derivatives.<br>Requires that swaps are cleared through an exchange or clearinghouse.|
|Title<br>VIII|Payment, Clearing, and Settlement Supervision Requires the Federal Reserve to create<br>standards to manage systemic risk.|
|Title<br>IX|Investor Protections and Improvements to the Regulation of Securities Creates Office of<br>Investor Advocate. Increases disclosures for individual investors in financial products.<br>Enhances whistleblower programs. Increases regulation of credit rating firms. Increases the<br>risk assumed by parties securitizing assets. Increases disclosure on executive compensation<br>and provides shareholder vote on compensation tri-annually.|
|Title<br>X|Bureau of Financial Protection Creates the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection within<br>the Federal Reserve System, charged with research, consumer financial education, and<br>consumer protection.|
|Title<br>XI|Federal Reserve System Created new position, the Vice Chairman for Supervision, on the<br>Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Increases responsibility of the Federal<br>Reserve to develop and monitor standards pertaining to risk management and liquidity.|
|Title<br>XII|Improving access to Mainstream Financial Institutions Increase participation of lowand<br>middle-income individuals in the banking system.|
|Title<br>XIII|Pay it Back Act Requires that funds not used or returned in the Troubled Asset Relief<br>Program [TARP] be used to offset the federal deficit.|
|Title<br>XIV|Mortgage Reform and Anti-predatory Lending Act Reform the mortgage lending process,<br>enhancing standards for lending and appraisals. Provides minimum underwriting standards for<br>all home mortgages. Requires development of programs to assist existing high-risk home<br>mortgage borrowers.|
|Title<br>XV|Miscellaneous Includes unrelated provisions for mine safety, conflict mineral mining, loans<br>issued by the International Monetary Fund, and other issues.|
|Title<br>XVI|Section 1256 contracts Exclude swaps and other specified derivatives from capital gain or loss<br>tax provisions that require mark-to-market for non-dealers.|

Titles IV, VII, IX and XII are intended to protect individual investors and borrowers, by more closely regulating the providers of financial products, financial service providers, and credit ratings. The creation of the Office of

Financial Research will likely result in more data available to evaluate firms in the financial services industry by providing metrics, research, and stress test results of financial service firms, among other things. There is also increased regulation of credit-rating agencies by the SEC, including additional public disclosures about credit rating decisions. This should result in more information to investors and creditors about not only the rated companies, but also about the ratings process.

A controversial provision relates to executive compensation. The law requires the disclosure to shareholders of the relation between executive compensation and performance, as well as the relation between the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the median compensation of all other employees. The purpose of this provision is to give shareholders additional power to affect compensation.

The remaining titles are dedicated primarily to “housekeeping” provisions that deal with unspent emergency bailout funds, and other matters.32 Though implementation of the act is still on-going and elements of the act may be adjusted with legislation, the provisions that affect the financial analysis of a company are likely to continue the trend towards increased disclosure of publicly traded companies.

## SUMMARY

Financial analysis is the selection, evaluation, and interpretation of financial data and other information with the objective of formulating forecasts of future cash flows of a company. Financial analysis is different from financial reporting; financial reporting conveys past and current financial information, whereas financial analysis is forward-looking. A challenge of financial analysis is to sort through the wealth of information and develop a meaningful analysis of a company.

Companies prepare and distribute information for regulators and shareholders. This information includes annual and quarterly financial reports (e.g., 10-K, 10-Q). Additional information may be gathered from 8K filings, company press releases, proxy statements, and through interviewing a company's representatives. Government agencies and commercial services prepare and disseminate information about individual companies, industries, and the economy.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has changed financial reporting and disclosures through additional disclosure requirements and through enhanced penalties for financial misconduct. The SOX act has also changed the responsibilities of the company's audit committee, as well as the relation with the auditor. In addition, this act has provisions that require the independence of the financial analyst from any investment banking functions of the analyst's employer.

The Dodd-Frank Act was a reaction to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and is intended to increase disclosures and to provide regulators with the tools necessary to identify entities facing financial difficulties that are “too big to fail” and to forestall another crisis of these proportions.

A key lesson from the issues that inspired the SOX Act and the DoddFrank Act is that analysts and investors must keep up with innovations in financial instruments, transactions, and disclosures.

# CHAPTER 2 Financial Statements

Financial statements are summaries of the operating, financing, and investment activities of a business. Financial statements should provide information useful to both investors and creditors in making credit, investment, and other business decisions. And this usefulness means that investors and creditors can use these statements to predict, compare, and

1 evaluate the amount, timing, and uncertainty of future cash flows  In other words, financial statements provide the information needed to assess a company's future earnings and, therefore, the cash flows expected to result from those earnings. In this chapter, we discuss the four basic financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, the statement of cash flows, and the statement of shareholders' equity.

## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES: WHAT ARE THEY?

The accounting data in financial statements are prepared by the firm's management according to a set of standards, referred to as _generally_

_accepted accounting principles_ (GAAP). These accounting principles were codified July 1, 2009, which was, essentially, an integration of standards, bulletins, implementation guides, opinions, and other literature that

 comprised GAAP prior to this codification

The financial statements of a company whose stock is publicly traded must, by law, be audited at least annually by an independent public accountant (i.e., an accountant who is not employed by the firm). In such an audit, the accountants examine the financial statements and the data from which these statements are prepared and attest—through the published auditor's opinion—that these statements have been prepared according to

GAAP. The auditor's opinion focuses whether the statements conform to

GAAP and that there is adequate disclosure of any material change in accounting principles.

The financial statements are created using several assumptions that affect how we use and interpret the financial data:

_Transactions are recorded at historical cost._ Therefore, the values shown in the statements are not market or replacement values, but rather reflect the original cost (adjusted for depreciation in the case of depreciable assets).

_The appropriate unit of measurement is the dollar._ While this seems logical, the effects of inflation, combined with the practice of recording values at historical cost, may cause problems in using and interpreting these values.

_The statements are recorded for predefined periods of time._ Generally, statements are produced to cover a chosen fiscal year or quarter, with the income statement and the statement of cash flows spanning a period's time and the balance sheet and statement of shareholders' equity as of the end of the specified period. But because the end of the fiscal year is generally chosen to coincide with the low point of activity in the operating cycle, the annual balance sheet and statement of shareholders' equity may not be representative of values for the year.

_Statements are prepared using accrual accounting and the matching_

_principle._ Most businesses use the _accrual accounting_, where income and revenues are matched in timing such that income is recorded in the period in which it is earned and expenses are reported in the period in which they are incurred _in an attempt to generate revenues_ . The result

- f the use of accrual accounting is that reported income does not necessarily coincide with cash flows. Because the financial analyst is concerned ultimately with cash flows, he or she often must understand how reported income relates to a company's cash flows.
_It is assumed that the business will continue as a going concern._ The assumption that the business enterprise will continue indefinitely justifies the appropriateness of using historical costs instead of current market values because these assets are expected to be used up over time instead of sold.
_Full disclosure requires providing information beyond the financial_
_statements._ The requirement that there be full disclosure means that, in addition to the accounting numbers for such accounting items as revenues, expenses, and assets, narrative and additional numerical disclosures are provided in notes accompanying the financial statements. An analysis of financial statements is therefore not complete without this additional information.
_Statements are prepared assuming conservatism._ In cases in which more than one interpretation of an event is possible, statements are prepared using the most conservative interpretation.
The financial statements and the auditors' findings are published in the firm's annual and quarterly reports sent to shareholders and the 10K and
10Q filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Also included in the reports, among other items, is a discussion by management, providing an overview of company events. The annual reports are much more detailed and disclose more financial information than the quarterly reports.
## WHAT DO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TELL US?
### The Balance Sheet

The _balance sheet_ is a report of the assets, liabilities, and equity of a firm at a point in time, generally at the end of a fiscal quarter or fiscal year. _Assets_ are resources of the business enterprise, which are comprised of current or long-lived assets. How did the company finance these resources? This was accomplished with liabilities and equity. _Liabilities_ are obligations of the business enterprise that must be repaid at a future point in time, whereas

_equity_ is the ownership interest of the business enterprise. The relation between assets, liabilities, and equity is simple, as reflected in the balance

- f what is owned and how it is financed, referred to as the _accounting_
:
_identity_
### Assets

Assets are anything that the company owns that has a value. These assets may have a physical existence or not. Examples of physical assets include inventory items held for sale, office furniture, and production equipment. If an asset does not have a physical existence, we refer to it as an intangible asset, such as a trademark or a patent. You can't see or touch an intangible asset, but still contributes value to the company.

Assets may also be current or long-term depending on how fast the company would be able to convert them into cash. Assets are generally reported in the balance sheet in order of liquidity, with the most liquid asset listed first and the least liquid listed last.

The most liquid assets of the company are the current assets. Current assets are assets that can be turned into cash in one operating cycle or one year, whichever is longer. This contrasts with the noncurrent assets, which cannot be liquidated quickly.

There are different types of current assets. The typical set of current assets is the following:

Cash, bills, and currency are assets that are equivalent to cash (e.g., bank account).

_Marketable securities_, which are securities that can be readily sold.

_Accounts receivable_, which are amounts due from customers arising from trade credit.

_Inventories_, which are investments in raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods for sale.

A company's need for current assets is dictated, in part, by its operating cycle. The operating cycle is the length of time it takes to turn the investment of cash into goods and services for sale back into cash in the form of collections from customers. The longer the operating cycle, the greater is a company's need for liquidity. For most firms, the operating cycle is less than or equal to one year.

Noncurrent assets comprise both physical and nonphysical assets. Plant assets are physical assets, such as buildings and equipment and are reflected in the balance sheet as gross plant and equipment and net plant and equipment. Gross plant and equipment, or gross property, plant, and equipment, is the total cost of investment in physical assets; that is, what the company originally paid for the property, plant, and equipment that it currently owns. Net plant and equipment, or net property, plant, and equipment, is the difference between gross plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation, and represents the book value of the plant and equipment assets. Accumulated depreciation is the sum of depreciation taken for physical assets in the firm's possession. Therefore,

Gross plant and equipment

_Less_ Accumulated depreciation

_Equals_ Net plant and equipment

Companies may present just the net plant and equipment figure on the balance sheet, placing the detail with respect to accumulated depreciation in a footnote. Interpreting financial statements requires knowing a bit about how assets are depreciated for financial reporting purposes. Depreciation is the allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life (or economic life).

In the case of the fictitious Sample Company, whose balance sheet we show in

Exhibit 2.1, the original cost of the fixed assets (i.e., plant, property, and equipment)—less any write-downs for impairment—for the year 2012 is

900 million. The accumulated depreciation for Sample in 2012 is

\$250 million; this means that the total of depreciation taken on existing fixed assets over time is \$250 million. The net property, plant, and equipment account balance is 650 million. This is also referred to as the book value or carrying value of these assets.

|EXHIBIT 2.1 The Sample Company Balance Sheet|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||||
|As of December 31, 2012 (in millions)|2012|2011|
|Cash|\$40|\$30|
|Accounts receivable|100|90|
|Inventory|180|200|
|Other current assets|10|10|
|TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS|\$350|\$330|
|Property, plant, and equipment|\$900|\$800|
|Less accumulated depreciation|270|200|
|Net property, plant, and equipment|\$630|\$600|
|Intangible assets|20|20|
|AsofDecember31 2012(inmillions)<br>,|2012|2011|
|---|---|---|
|TOTAL ASSETS|\$1,000|\$950|
|Accounts payable|\$150|\$140|
|Current maturities of long-term debt|60|40|
|TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES|\$180|\$165|
|Long-term debt|300|250|
|TOTAL LIABILITIES|\$380|\$325|
|Minority interest|30|15|
|Common stock|50|50|
|Additional paid-in capital|100|100|
|Retained earnings|500|400|
|TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY|650|550|
|TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY|\$1,000|\$950|

Intangible assets are assets that are not financial instruments, yet have no physical existence, such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, franchises, and formulae. Intangible assets may be amortized over some period, which is akin to depreciation. Keep in mind that a company may own a number of intangible assets that are not reported on the balance sheet. A company may

- nly include an intangible asset's value on its balance sheet if (1) there are likely future benefits attributable specifically to the asset, and (2) the cost of the intangible asset can be measured.
Suppose a company has an active, ongoing investment in research and development to develop new products. It must expense what is spent on research and development (R&D) each year because for a given investment in R&D, it likely doesn't meet the two criteria because it isn't until much later, after the R&D expense is made, that the economic viability of the investment is determined. If, on the other hand, a company buys a patent from another company, this cost may be capitalized and then amortized over the remaining life of the patent. So when you look at a company's assets on its balance sheet, you may not be getting the complete picture of what it
- wns.
### Liabilities

We generally use the terms “liability” and “debt” as synonymous terms, though “liability” is actually a broader term, encompassing not only the explicit contracts that a company has, in terms of short-term and long-term debt obligations, but also includes obligations that are not specified in a contract, such as environmental obligations or asset retirement obligations.

Liabilities may be interest bearing, such as a bond issue, or noninterest bearing, such as amounts due to suppliers.

In the balance sheet, liabilities are presented in order of their due date and are often presented in two categories, current liabilities and long-term liabilities. Current liabilities are obligations due within one year or one

- perating cycle (whichever is longer). Current liabilities consist of:
_Accounts payable_, which are amounts due to suppliers for purchases on credit.
Wages and salaries payable, which are amounts due employees.
Current portion of long-term indebtedness.
Short-term bank loans.
Long-term liabilities are obligations that are due beyond one year. There are different types of long-term liabilities, including:
_Notes payables_ and _bonds_, which are indebtedness (loans) in the form
   of securities.
_Capital leases_, which are rental obligations that are long-term, fixed commitments.
_Asset retirement liability_, which is the contractual or statutory
- bligation to retire or decommission the asset and restore the site to required standards at the end of the asset's life.
_Deferred taxes_, which are taxes that may have to be paid in the future that are currently not due, though they are expensed for financial reporting purposes. Deferred taxes arise from differences between
 accounting and tax methods (e.g., depreciation methods)
### Equity

The equity of a company is the ownership interest. The book value of equity, which for a corporation is often referred to as shareholders' equity or stockholders' equity, is basically the amount that investors paid the company for their ownership interest, plus any earnings (or less any losses), and minus any distributions to owners. For a corporation, equity is the amount that investors paid the corporation for the stock when it was initially sold, plus or minus any earnings or losses, less any dividends paid.

Keep in mind that for any company, the reported amount of equity is an accumulation over time since the company's inception (or incorporation, in the case of a corporation).

Shareholders equity is the carrying or book value of the ownership of a company. Shareholders' equity is comprised of

Par value A nominal amount per share of stock (sometimes prescribed by law), or the stated value, which is a nominal amount per share of stock assigned for accounting purposes if the stock has no par value.

_Plus_ Additional paid-in-capital

Also referred to as _capital surplus_, the amount paid for shares of stock by investors in excess of par or stated value.

_Less_ Treasury stock The accounting value of shares of the firm's own stock bought by the firm.

_Plus_ Retained earnings

_Plus_ Accumulated comprehensive income or loss

The accumulation of prior and current periods' earnings and losses, less any prior or current periods' dividends.

The total amount of income or loss that arises from transactions that result in income or losses, yet are not reported through the income statement. Items giving rise to this income include foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments.

As an example, consider what The Coca-Cola Company reported on its

|2010 balance sheet: 4|Col2|
|---|---|
|In millions|Year ended December 31, 2010 (in millions)|
|Common stock, \$0.25 par value|\$880|
|Capital surplus|10,057|
|Reinvested earnings|49,278|
|Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)|–1,450|
|Less treasury stock|−27,762|
|Shareowners' equity|31,003|

The book value of equity for Coca-Cola at the end of 2010 is

\$31.003 billion. With 2.308 billion shares outstanding, Coca-Cola's book value of equity per share of stock is \$31.003 ÷ 2.308 = 13.433 per share.

This differs from its market value as of December 31, 2010, which was

\$149.63 billion, or \$64.83 per share.

### A Note on Minority Interest

On many companies' consolidated financial statements, you will notice a balance sheet account entitled “Minority Interest.” When a company owns a substantial portion of another company, the accounting principles require that the company consolidate that company's financial statements into its

- wn. Basically what happens in consolidating the financial statements is that the parent company will add the accounts of the subsidiary to its accounts (i.e., Subsidiary inventory + Parent inventory = Consolidated
 inventory)
If the parent does not own 100\% of the subsidiary's ownership interest, an account is created, referred to as _minority interest_, which reflects the amount of the subsidiary's assets _not_ owned by the parent. This account will be presented between liabilities and equity on the consolidated balance sheet. Is it a liability or an equity account? It's neither.
A similar addition and adjustment takes place on the income statement.
The minority interest account on the income statement reflects the income
(or loss) in proportion to the equity in the subsidiary not owned by the parent.
### Structure of the Balance Sheet

Consider a simple balance sheet for the Sample Company that we show in

Exhibit 2.1 for fiscal years ending 2011 and 2012, with the most recent fiscal year's data presented in the left-most column of data. You will notice that the accounting identity holds; that is, total assets are equal to the sum of the total liabilities and the total shareholders' equity.

U.S. companies typically report asset accounts in the balance sheet in the

- rder of liquidity, with the most liquid asset first, cash. The liability accounts are reported in the order in which they are due, with trade credit generally listed first, and long-term debt listed last. Within the equity accounts, the accounts begin with what shareholders have paid in, what they have paid out in the form of Treasury stock, and then earnings, less dividends, in the retained earnings.
Companies that adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) will generally present the assets so that noncurrent assets are listed first, followed by current assets. This is done to emphasize the importance
- f the noncurrent assets, such as plant and equipment, in the operation of the business. In addition, these companies typically report equity before liabilities, and within liabilities include the noncurrent liabilities before current liabilities.
### The Income Statement

The _income statement_ is a summary of operating performance over a period

- f time (e.g., a fiscal quarter or a fiscal year). We start with the revenue of the company over a period of time and then subtract the costs and expenses related to that revenue. The bottom line of the income statement consists of the owners' earnings for the period. To arrive at this “bottom line”, we need to compare revenues and expenses. The basic structure of the income statement includes the following:
Sales or revenues Represent the amount of goods or services sold, in terms of price paid by customers.
_Less_ Cost of goods sold
(or cost of sales)
The amount of goods or services sold, in terms of cost to the firm.
_Equals_ Gross profit The difference between sales and cost of goods sold.
_Less_ Selling and general expenditures
Salaries, administrative, marketing expenditures, etc.
_Equals_ Operating profit Income from operations (ignores effects of financing decisions and taxes); earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), operating income, and
			   operating earnings.
_Less_ Interest expense Interest paid on debt.
_Equals_ Net income before taxes
Earnings before taxes.
_Less_ Taxes Taxes expense for the current period.
_Equals_ Net income Operating profit less financing expenses (e.g., interest) and taxes.
_Less_ Preferred stock dividends
_Equals_ Earnings available to common shareholders
Dividends paid to preferred shareholders.
Net income less preferred stock dividends; residual income.
Though the structure of the income statement varies by company, the basic idea is to present the operating results first, followed by nonoperating results. The _cost of sales_, also referred to as the _cost of goods sold_, is deducted from revenues, producing a _gross profit_ ; that is, a profit without considering all other general operating costs. These general operating expenses are those expenses related to the support of the general operations
- f the company, which includes salaries, marketing costs, and research and development. Depreciation, which is the amortized cost of physical assets, is also deducted from gross profit. The amount of the depreciation expense represents the cost of the wear and tear on the property, plant, and equipment of the company.
Once we have the operating income, we have summarized the company's performance with respect to the operations of the business. But there is generally more to a company's performance. From operating income, we deduct interest expense and add any interest income. Further, adjustments are made for any other income or cost that is not a part of the company's core business.
There are a number of other items that may appear as adjustments to arrive at net income. One of these is extraordinary items, which are defined as unusual and infrequent gains or losses. Another adjustment would be for the expense related to the write-down of an asset's value.
In the case of the Sample Company, whose income statement is presented in Exhibit 2.2, the income from operations—its core business—is
190 million, whereas the net income (i.e., the “bottom line”) is
100 million.

|Operating profit|190|

### Earnings Per Share

Companies provide information on _earnings per share_ (EPS) in their annual and quarterly financial statement information, as well as in their periodic press releases. Generally, EPS is calculated as net income, divided by the number of shares outstanding. Companies must report both basic and

 diluted earnings per share

_Basic earnings per share_ is net income (minus preferred dividends), divided by the average number of shares outstanding. _Diluted earnings per_

_share_ is net income (minus preferred dividends), divided by the number of shares outstanding considering all dilutive securities (e.g., convertible debt,

- ptions). Diluted earnings per share, therefore, gives the shareholder information about the potential dilution of earnings. For companies with a large number of dilutive securities (e.g., stock options, convertible preferred stock, or convertible bonds), there can be a significant difference between basic and diluted EPS. You can see the effect of dilution by comparing the basic and diluted EPS.
Consider Goggle, Inc. We provide its basic and diluted earnings per share in Exhibit 2.3.
These two per share amounts differ slightly, primarily due to
 restricted stock options

### More on Depreciation

There are different methods that can be used to allocate an asset's cost over its life. Generally, if the asset is expected to have value at the end of its economic life, the expected value, referred to as a _salvage value_ (or _residual_

_value_ ), is not depreciated; rather, the asset is depreciated down to its salvage value. There are different methods of depreciation that we classify as either straight-line or accelerated. _Straight-line depreciation_ allocates the cost

(less salvage value) in a uniform manner (equal amount per period) throughout the asset's life. _Accelerated depreciation_ allocates the asset's cost (less salvage value) such that more depreciation is taken in the earlier years of the asset's life. There are alternative accelerated methods available,

 8 including

_Declining balance method_, in which a constant rate is applied to a

_declining_ amount (the undepreciated cost).

_Sum-of-the-years' digits method_, in which a _declining_ rate is applied to the asset's .

_depreciable basis_

A common declining balance method is the _double-declining balance_

_method_ (DDB), which applies the rate that is twice that of the straight-line rate. In this case, the straight-line rate is 10\% per year; therefore, the declining balance rate is 20\% per year. We apply this rate of 20\% against the original cost of \$1,000,000, resulting in a depreciation expense in the first year of $200,000. In the second year, we apply this 20\% against the undepreciated balance of $1,000,000 – \$200,000 = 800,000, resulting in a

9,10

 depreciation of 160,000

For this same asset, the sum-of-the-years' digits (SYD) depreciation for the first year is the rate of 10/55, or 18.18\%, applied against the depreciable basis of \$1,000,000 – \$100,000 = 900,000:

We calculate the denominator as the “sum of years”:

In the second year, we apply the rate of 9 ÷ 55 against the 900,000, and so on.

Accelerated methods result in higher depreciation expenses in earlier years, relative to straight-line, as you can see in Exhibit 2.4. As a result, accelerated methods result in lower reported earnings in earlier years, relative to straight-line. When comparing companies, it is important to understand whether the companies use different methods of depreciation because the choice of depreciation method affects both the balance sheet

(through the carrying value of the asset) and the income statement (through the depreciation expense).

EXHIBIT 2.4 Comparison of Depreciation Expense and Book Value

_Note:_ Depreciation expense each year for an asset with an original cost of \$1,000,000, a salvage value of \$10,000, and a 10-year useful life.

A major source of deferred income taxes and deferred tax assets is the accounting methods used for financial reporting purposes and tax purposes.

In the case of financial accounting purposes, the company chooses the method that best reflects how its assets lose value over time, though most companies use the straight-line method. However, for tax purposes the company has no choice but to use the prescribed rates of depreciation, using the _Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System_ (MACRS). For tax purposes, a company does not have discretion over the asset's depreciable life or the rate of depreciation—they must use the MACRS system.

The MACRS system does not incorporate salvage value and is based on a declining balance system. The depreciable life for tax purposes may be longer than or shorter than that used for financial reporting purposes. For example, the MACRS rate for a 3and 5-year assets are as follows:

|Year|3 -year|5 -year|
|---|---|---|
|1|33.33\%|20.00\%|
|2|44.45\%|32.00\%|
|3|14.81\%|19.20\%|
|4|7.41\%|11.52\%|
|5||11.52\%|
|6||5.76\%|

You will notice the fact that a 3-year asset is depreciated over four years and a 5-year asset is depreciated over six years. That's the result of using what is referred to as a half-year convention—using only half a year's worth

- f depreciation in the first year of an asset's life. This system results in a leftover amount that must still be depreciated in the last year (i.e., the fourth year in the case of a 3-year asset and the sixth year in the case of a 5-year asset). We provide a comparison of straight-line and MACRS depreciation in Exhibit 2.5.
You can see that the methods produce different depreciation expenses, which result in the different income amounts for tax and financial reporting purposes.
EXHIBIT 2.5 Depreciation for Financial Accounting Purposes vs. Tax
Purposes
_Note:_ Consider an asset that costs \$200,000 and has a salvage value of \$20,000. If the asset has a useful life of eight years, but is classified as a 5-year asset for tax purposes, the depreciation and book value of the asset will be different between the financial accounting records and the tax records.
### The Statement of Cash Flows

The _statement of cash flows_ is the summary of a firm's cash flows, summarized by operations, investment activities, and financing activities.

We provide a simplified cash flow statement (Exhibit 2.6) for the fictitious

Sample Company. _Cash flow from operations_ is cash flow from day-to-day

- perations. Cash flow from operating activities is basically net income adjusted for (1) noncash expenditures and income, and (2) changes in working capital accounts.
**EXHIBIT 2.6** The Sample Company Statement of Cash Flows for the Period Ending December 31,
2012 (in millions)

|Netincome|100|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||||
|Adddepreciation|50|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Subtract increase in accounts receivable|–10||
|Add decrease in inventory|20||
|Add increase in accounts payable|50||
|CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS (CFO)||210|
|Retire debt|– 100||
|CASH FLOW FOR FINANCING (CFF)||–100|
|Purchase of equipment|– 100||
|CASH FLOW FOR INVESTMENT (CFI)||–100|
|CASH FLOW FOR INVESTMENT (CFI)|||
|CHANGE IN CASH FLOW||10|

The adjustment for changes in working capital accounts is necessary to adjust net income that is determined using the accrual method to a cash flow amount. Increases in current assets and decreases in current liabilities are positive adjustments to arrive at the cash flow; decreases in current assets and increases in current liabilities are negative adjustments to arrive at the cash flow.

_Cash flow for/from investing_ is the cash flows related to the acquisition

(purchase) of plant, equipment, and other assets, as well as the proceeds from the sale of assets. _Cash flow for/from financing activities_ is the cash flow from activities related to the sources of capital funds (e.g., buyback common stock, pay dividends, issue bonds).

Not all of the classifications required by accounting principles are consistent with the true flow for the three types of activities. For example, interest expense is a financing cash flow, yet it affects the cash flow from

- perating activities because it is a deduction to arrive at net income. This inconsistency is also the case for interest income and dividend income, both
- f which result from investing activities, but show up in the cash flow from
- perating activities through their contributions to net income.
The sources of a company's cash flows can reveal a great deal about the company and its prospects. For example, a financially healthy company tends to consistently generate cash flows from operations (that is, positive
- perating cash flows) and invests cash flows (that is, negative investing cash flows). To remain viable, a company must be able to generate funds from its operations; to grow, a company must continually make capital investments.
The change in cash flow—although referred to as the net cash flow—is the bottom line in the statement of cash flows and is equal to the change in the cash account as reported on the balance sheet. For the Sample
Company, shown in Exhibit 2.6, the net change in cash flow is a positive
\$10 million; this is equal to the change in the cash account from \$50 to
60 million.
By studying the cash flows of a company over time, we can gauge a company's financial health. For example, if a company relies on external financing to support its operations (that is, cash flows from financing and not from operations) for an extended period of time, this is a warning sign
- f financial trouble up ahead.
We provide two examples of patterns in Exhibit 2.7: General Motors and
Ford, both U.S. automobile manufacturers. Both companies generated cash flows from operations in 2007, but General Motors had a significant cash flow _for_ - perations (that is, a negative cash flow) in 2008, which led up to its bankruptcy filing in June 1, 2009. Leading up to the bankruptcy, General
Motors received a 20.645 billion loan from the U.S. Department of the
Treasury; \$16.645 billion before filing for bankruptcy, \$4 billion after filing. General Motors received 33 billion of debtor-in-possession financing immediately after filing for bankruptcy, but before emerging from bankruptcy on July 10, 2009. You can see this in Exhibit 2.7: General
Motors had outflows to sustain its operations, but substantial inflows from the government and debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing.
EXHIBIT 2.7 Two Examples of Cash Flow Patterns: General Motors and
Ford Motor Company
_Source:_ 10-K filings, various years.
The cash flow pattern of Ford Motor Company is more indicative of cash flows of a healthy business. The downturn in the economy is evident in
2008, but Ford was able to recover, generating positive cash flows from
- perations, making investments, and reducing its debt obligations.
### The Statement of Stockholders' Equity

The _statement of stockholders' equity_ (also referred to as the _statement of_

_shareholders' equity_ ) is a summary of the changes in the equity accounts, including information on stock options exercised, repurchases of shares, and Treasury shares. The basic structure is to include a reconciliation of the balance in each component of equity from the beginning of the fiscal year with the end of the fiscal year, detailing changes attributed to net income, dividends, purchases, or sales of Treasury stock. The components are common stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, and Treasury stock. For each of these components, the statement begins with the balance

- f each at the previous fiscal period and then adjustments are shown to produce the balance at the end of the current fiscal period.
In addition, there is a reconciliation of any gains or losses that affect stockholders' equity but which do not flow through the income statement, such as foreign-currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains on investments. These items are of interest because they are part of comprehensive income, and hence income to owners, but they are not represented on the company's income statement.
### Why Bother about the Footnotes?

Footnotes to the financial statements contain additional information, supplementing or explaining financial statement data. These notes are presented in both the annual report and the 10-K filing (with the SEC), though the latter usually provides a greater depth of information.

The footnotes to the financial statements provide information pertaining to:

_The significant accounting policies and practices that the company_

_uses_

. This helps the analyst with interpreting the results, comparing the results to other companies and to other years for the same company, and assessing the quality of the reported information.

_Income taxes_ . The footnotes tell us about the company's current and deferred income taxes, breakdowns by the type of tax (e.g., federal vs.

state), and the effective tax rate that the company is paying.

_Pension plans_ . The detail about pension plans, including the pension assets and the pension liability, is important in determining whether a company's pension plan is overfunded or underfunded.

_Leases_ . You can learn about both the capital leases, which are the longterm lease obligations that are reported on the balance sheet, and about the future commitments under operating leases, which are not reflected

   on the balance sheet.
_Long-term debt_ . You can find detailed information about the maturity dates and interest rates on the company's debt obligations.
The phrase “the devil is in the details” applies aptly to the footnotes of a company's financial statement. Through the footnotes, a company is providing information that is crucial in analyzing a company's financial health and performance. If footnotes are vague or confusing, as they were in the case of Enron prior to the break in the scandal, the analyst must ask questions to help understand this information.
## ACCOUNTING FLEXIBILITY

The generally accepted accounting principles provide some choices in the manner in which some transactions and assets are accounted. For example, a company may choose to account for inventory, and hence costs of sales, using _Last-in_, _First-out_ (LIFO) or _First-in_, _First-out_ (FIFO). This is intentional because these principles are applied to a broad set of companies and no single set of methods offers the best representation of a company's condition or performance for all companies. Ideally, a company's management chooses those accounting methods and presentations that are most appropriate for the company.

A company's management has always had the ability to manage earnings through the judicious choice of accounting methods within the GAAP framework. The company's “watchdogs” (i.e., the independent auditors) should keep the company's management in check. However, recent scandals have revealed that the watchdog function of the independent accounting firms was not working well. Additionally, some companies' management used manipulation of financial results and outright fraud to distort their financial picture.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 offers some comfort in terms of creating the oversight board for the auditing accounting firms. In addition, the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and the International

Accounting Standards Board (IASB) are tightening some of the flexibility that companies had in the past.

### Pro Forma Financial Data

_Pro forma financial information_ is really a misnomer—the information is neither pro forma (that is, forward looking), nor reliable financial data.

What is it? It is popularly referred to as _creative accounting_ . This practice started during the Internet–tech boom in the 1990s and persists today: companies release financial information that is prepared according to its

- wn liking, using accounting methods that they create.
Why did companies start doing this? What's wrong with GAAP? During the Internet–tech stock boom, many start-up companies quickly went public and then felt the pressure to generate profits. However, profits in that industry were hard to come by during that period of time. What some companies did is generate financial data that they included in company releases that reported earnings not calculated using GAAP—but rather by methods of their own. In some cases, these alternative methods hid a lot of the ills of these companies.
Another reason for presenting other accounting for earnings per share is to provide a value that is comparable with previous or future years by eliminating nonrecurring transactions. In these cases, when you read the press release you will see phrases such as “would have been,”
“comparable,” “adjusted,” or “excluding the impact of.” Essentially, these are pro forma earnings without referring to them as pro forma.
We show a few examples of the differences between a company's pro
Exhibit 2.8.
forma net income and net income per GAAP in As you can see in these examples, the pro forma amounts may differ substantially from the amounts according to GAAP.
**EXHIBIT 2.8** Examples of Pro Forma or Comparable vs. GAAP Earnings per Share

|Col1|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||Earnings per Share|Earnings per Share|
|2010 Diluted Earnings per Share|Pro Forma or Comparable|U.S. GAAP|
|Baxter|\$3.98|\$2.39|
|Garmin|\$1.23|\$0.86|
|Goldman Sachs|\$15.22|\$13.18|
|Franklin Electric|\$1.94|\$1.66|
|_Source of data:_ Individual company press releases.|_Source of data:_ Individual company press releases.|_Source of data:_ Individual company press releases.|

The use of pro forma or “would-have-been” financial data may be helpful, but also may be misleading to investors. Analysts routinely adjust published financial statement data to remove unusual, nonrecurring items.

This can give the analyst a better predictor of the continued performance of the company. So what is wrong with the company itself doing this? There is nothing wrong unless it becomes misleading, such as a company including its nonrecurring gains yet not including its nonrecurring losses. In concern for the possibility of misleading information being given to investors, the

SEC requires that if companies release pro forma financial data, they must

11 also reconcile this data with GAAP

## HOW DOES ACCOUNTING IN THE UNITED STATES DIFFER FROM ACCOUNTING OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES?

The generally accepted accounting standards in the United States (U.S.

GAAP) differ from those used in other countries around the world, sometimes with regard to the principles themselves and sometimes with regard to the interpretation of the principles. But not for long. What is happening is an international convergence of accounting standards. The first major step was the agreement in 2002 between two major standard setting bodies—the Financial Accounting Standards Board of the United States and the International Accounting Standards Board—to work together for

 eventual convergence of accounting principles The second major step was the requirement of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by the European Commission, effective in 2005. The third step was a formal agreement in 2008. The fourth step was the action by the SEC to allow presentation of IFRS for non-U.S. companies without the previously required IFRS-U.S. GAAP reconciliation.

IFRS are promulgated by the IASC and must be used by all publicly traded and private companies in the European Union. IFRS are also used, in varying degrees, by companies in Australia, Hong Kong, Russia, and China.

IFRS, like GAAP, uses historical cost as the main accounting convention.

However, IFRS permits the revaluation of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment (PPE), and investment property. IFRS also requires fair valuation of certain categories of financial instruments and certain biological assets. In contrast, U.S. GAAP prohibits revaluations except for certain categories of financial instruments, which must be carried at fair value. Despite these differences, the convergence of U.S. GAAP and IFRS is imminent.

## SUMMARY

Much of the financial data that are used in financial analysis are drawn from the company's financial statements. It is important to understand these data so that we can interpret this information and use them in the analysis of a company's past financial condition and performance, so that we have an idea of what to expect in the future.

There are four basic financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, the statement of cash flows, and the statement of stockholders' equity. The balance sheet and the statement of shareholders' equity are statements with values of accounts at a point in time. In the case of the balance sheet, the company presents data as of the end of the most recent two years. In the case of the statement of shareholders' equity, the balances in accounts are reconciled from the beginning of the latest fiscal year to the end. The income statement and the statement of cash flows provide data on earnings and cash flows over the period, whether that period be a fiscal quarter of year.

The information conveyed in the footnotes is essential to the understanding of these financial statements. There is detail in these footnotes that gives us a better idea of the financial health of the company.

In addition to being able to read the financial statements and the accompanying footnotes, an analyst must understand the accounting principles that guide companies in the preparation of these financial statements. Not only must the analyst understand the accounting methods that a company uses, but the choices that a company has made among the available accounting methods as well.

There is a goal among regulatory bodies around the world to develop one set of accounting principles to be used by companies worldwide. The

International Financial Reporting Standards and the coordination of FASB and IASB in an effort to move toward convergence are significant steps toward this goal.

# CHAPTER 3 The Quality of Financial Information

Shareholders and creditors depend on the financial statements of companies that are prepared according to generally accepted accounting standards

(GAAP). These financial statements have important economic consequences that include determining management compensation, the credit quality of the company's debt obligations, and compliance with loan covenants. Yet despite the important economic consequences of these financial statements, a company's management has considerable flexibility in the choice of accounting methods and estimates. This flexibility, however, creates a situation in which the accounting choices that a company makes affect reported financial information.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the regulations and changes in accounting standards that followed increase the transparency of financial statements. Financial reporting by companies is considered _transparent_ when it is easy for investors to understand the company's performance and financial condition. We associate transparency with a high quality of financial information. In terms of valuing companies, those companies with more transparent financial information will be associated with higher values than companies with nontransparent information, if everything else is the same. This is because the opaqueness of the financial information in the latter company increases the uncertainty with respect to the current and future performance of the company and, for that reason, reduces the company's value.

Aside from the lack of comparability that it presents, the wide latitude that management has in making choices and estimates allows for earnings management. _Earnings management_ is the judicious choice of accounting methods for financial reporting to produce results that are in the best interests of the company or its management. This is different from earnings manipulation, which has a more sinister connotation, though it is admittedly sometimes difficult to distinguish management from manipulation. Earnings management involves working within the bounds of GAAP, whereas earnings manipulation involves violating GAAP.

Do companies manage earnings? There is sufficient academic research that suggests that companies do manage earnings, whether for managers' self-interests or for some other reasons (e.g., to comply with debt covenant

 provisions or to minimize political costs) The risk of this type of

 provisions or to minimize political costs) The risk of this type of management is great when management's compensation depends on

 reported financial data, such as earnings The risk is also great when

 reported financial data, such as earnings The risk is also great when management is overly concerned with achieving analyst earnings forecasts

- r the company is near financial data–based constraints, such as debt covenant restrictions.
The analyst must be able to detect earnings management, earnings manipulation, or any other type of management or manipulation of financial data. Financial data may be managed in many ways and it is a challenge of financial analysis to detect such management. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the quality of financial information that companies report. There are many ways that companies can obscure the view of their financial performance and we point out some of the devices that companies may use either intentionally or unintentionally.
We discuss several avenues for financial information management in this chapter and discuss what to look for in financial data. In particular, we discuss:
Accruals management.
Revenue and expense recognition.
Non-operating and non-recurring items.
Goodwill impairment.
Inventory accounting.
Depreciation.
Income and expenses related to segments.
After discussing the detective work that can reveal earnings management, we discuss some of the tell-tale signs to look for in an analysis of financial statements.
## IT'S ALL IN THE TIMING
### Accruals Management

Accruals are the accounting adjustments that relate earnings to cash flows.

We typically classify accruals into two types: _discretionary accruals_ and

_nondiscretionary accruals_ . A large part of earnings management deals with accruals and, in particular, discretionary accruals.

We expect that working capital accounts will move in accordance with revenues and that depreciation is proportionate to plant, property, and equipment. Therefore, we expect that accruals will increase as revenues increase and depreciation will increase as the company increases its investment in plant and equipment. Consider the sales of goods on credit. A sale on credit does not generate a cash flow, but rather increases accounts receivable (an accrual) and income. The accruals arising from sales on credit are part of the normal course of business and fall into the class of nondiscretionary accruals; as sales increase, the balance in the accounts receivable account should increase as well.

Aside from these nondiscretionary accruals that arise from the normal course of business there are also discretionary accruals, which should catch the attention of the financial analyst. The problem that the financial analyst faces is that accruals are not conveniently disclosed on the financial statements as discretionary or nondiscretionary. Therefore, the analyst must pay attention to particular aspects of accruals that may signal earnings

 management

An example of a discretionary accrual that bears watching is the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate of the uncollectible accounts receivable and serves to reduce the value of accounts receivable on the balance sheet. The amount of receivables that are uncollectible is determined by management's judgment, considering past experience, the quality of the current customer accounts, the economy, and the company's collection policies. But because the allowance is an estimate, there is some flexibility for management to determine in any given period the change in the value of doubtful accounts.

Determining whether earnings are managed by varying the allowance is not possible, yet there are some tell-tale signs: the relationship between the allowance and the balance in accounts receivable—that is, the percentage of uncollectible accounts—should be relatively constant unless there is a change in the economy overall or a change in customer base (i.e., extending credit to a broader range of credit quality). And for most companies, the allowance rate (allowance for doubtful accounts divided by the gross accounts receivable) is relatively constant. Further, because of similarities in customers within an industry, we should also find similar (but not identical) rates of uncollectible accounts within an industry.

There are companies that appear to change the rate of uncollectible accounts as their fortunes change. The ratio of the allowance of uncollectible accounts should be rather constant over time, varying primarily when there is change in product mix, a downturn in the economy,

- r a change in credit policies.
Consider the Washington Post's allowances for doubtful accounts, as we show in Exhibit 3.1.
In years in which revenues began to decline and profitability changed, the allowance rate decreased. The ratio of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to accounts receivable averaged around 18.6\% over the 1997–2011 period.
EXHIBIT 3.1 Profit Margins and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts as a
Percentage of Receivables for Washington Post, Fiscal Years 1997 through
_Source of data:_ Washington Post Company, 10-K filings by the various years.
Aside from looking at the relationship between specific accounts and reserves, another screen that is useful is to compare the trend in net income to that of cash flows from operations. The two trends should be moving in the same direction at the same time. We expect that the amount of cash flow from operations will be different from that of net earnings, but we expect that the changes in each series should follow a similar path. A misalignment may suggest a problem with accruals.
Let's compare two companies using this method over the period 1989–
2010. First, consider General Electric. The cash flow from operations and net income follow similar paths, as we show in Exhibit 3.2(A). The correlation between these two series is 0.92, which indicates that these series are similar in terms of trends  4 This is not the same conclusion we series are similar in terms of trends  4 This is not the same conclusion we draw from looking at the paths of cash flow from operations and net income for Eastman Kodak, as shown in Exhibit 3.2(B). In this case, the correlation
- f the two series is 0.32. The paths of these series are similar in the case of the earlier years for Eastman Kodak, but beginning after 2006, the paths converge. Eastman Kodak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy January 19,
2012.5
EXHIBIT 3.2 Cash Flow from Operation and Net Income: General Electric and Eastman Kodak
_Sources of data:_ General Electric, 10-K filings, various years; Eastman Kodak, 10-K filings, various years.
Keep in mind that there may be reasons why a company's net income and cash flow from operations differ, such as write-downs of asset values. In performing a financial analysis of a company, however, the analyst may want to identify the reasons why these two series diverge.
### Revenue and Expense Recognition

One of the basic guiding principles of accounting is that revenues and expenses are matched: revenues are recognized (that is, included in income) in the period in which they are earned, and expenses are matched with revenues, matched to coordinate with the corresponding revenue. And because most companies use the accrual method of accounting, revenues and expenses recognized in a period do not necessarily correspond with the cash inflows and outflows that are the basis of the revenues and expenses.

The accrual basis of accounting relies on management's discretion in determining the timing of revenue and expense recognition. Along with management's discretion, however, is the potential to manipulate income through judicious timing of revenues and expenses.

The principle of conservatism in accounting suggests that if there is some flexibility in the recognition of revenues and expenses, the most conservative approach should be used. However, the recognition of revenues and expenses requires judgment and there are many cases in which the timing decisions have raised concerns over the quality of a company's earnings. The primary techniques that have been used to inflate revenues or income are cookie-jar reserves and channel stuffing.

_Cookie-jar reserves_ are a method of income smoothing. In a typical cookie jar scheme, a company makes inappropriate assumptions about liabilities (e.g., loan losses), often overstating them in good earnings years.

And then, in a future period when earnings are not as good as expected, they reverse this transaction, hence reaching into the “cookie jar.”

_Channel stuffing_ is the inflation of revenues of manufacturers or suppliers, and hence earnings, by forcing distributors or retail outlets to take

- n more units of products than they are able to sell. By forcing customers to take on more inventory than is reasonable given demand, there are likely significant returns to suppliers after the close of the fiscal period. Therefore, channel stuffing speeds up revenues and earnings at the expense of future periods' revenues and earnings.
The classic channel stuffing case is that of Sunbeam in the 1990s, but there have been other cases since then  6 Consider the case of McAfee there have been other cases since then  6 Consider the case of McAfee
Corporation. The SEC alleged that McAfee executives provided false and
 7 misleading financial statements through several devices
_Channel stuffing_, which resulted in inflating revenues starting in 1998 by inducing distributors to take on more inventory than necessary by creating a wholly owned subsidiary to repurchase any oversold inventory at a profit to the distributors.
Paying cash to distributors in place of offering discounts, giving the appearance that they were being paid in full by the distributors.
Improper accounting of revenues, recognizing revenues in period before permissible according to GAAP.
The results of these actions were to inflate revenues and net income in the
 years 1998 through 2000, among other things
It is not possible to detect all of these misdeeds by reading through its financial statements because some items, such as the existence of a
9 subsidiary to buy-back products, were never disclosed  But were there

McAfee growth appears to be steady, but its primary competitor,
Symantec, had slow revenue growth in 1998.

We provide McAfee's revenues and net income before and after the restatement in Exhibit 3.3.
As you can see, if McAfee had not violated accounting principles, it would have reported falling revenues and a loss in
1998, rather than the increasing revenues and positive net income that it had reported. For its accounting misdeeds, McAfee restated its financial statements and paid a 50 million settlement.

### Extraordinary and Nonrecurring Items

In general, a company's earnings and cash flows should be generated from the operations of its business, rather than through nonrecurring means. A close examination of the sources of revenues in the income statement and notes may reveal nonoperating gains and losses. These nonoperating items are presented under various names, including “special,” “nonrecurring,” and

“unusual.”

Nonrecurring items are the result of unusual events and are reported as part of operating expenses. For example, if a company that operates retail stores closes several of its stores, it would record a charge for the costs associated with these closings. As another example, a company that is on the losing side of a lawsuit would report the settlement or penalty as a nonrecurring charge against income.

A special type of nonrecurring item is the voluntary effect of a change in accounting principle. If the company changes an accounting principle in the current period, the company applies the change retrospectively, revising

14 past earnings to reflect the effect in each period presented  If it is not

14 past earnings to reflect the effect in each period presented  If it is not practical to represent the cumulative effect of the change to earnings in the current or recent years (say, because the effect cannot be attributed to a particular year), the entire charge is presented in the balance sheet as an

 adjustment to shareholders' equity

Extraordinary items are defined as unusual and infrequent and are presented in the income statement after continuing operations and net of tax. There is a subtle distinction between nonrecurring items that are included in operating results and extraordinary items that are reported in the nonoperating portion of the income statement. These nonrecurring items are unavoidable and, with recent changes in accounting standards, may become more frequent. From the point of view of the analyst, these items are important in at least two respects:

**1.** These items make the bottom line earnings more volatile and, hence, more difficult to use as a basis for predictions about future earnings.

**2.** These items may signal important company events, such as writedowns of inventory or fixed plant assets.

In the 1980s and 1990s, many companies had significant restructuring charges and may have used these to manage earnings. However, some companies, such as International Business Machines (IBM), now consider

15 restructuring charges part of their normal business and hence do not

 separate these changes as special

Further, many companies report nonrecurring and extraordinary items that have become quite ordinary, reporting gains and losses each year arising from these sources. This makes it difficult for the analyst to determine the result of the operations of the company and what is simply transitory.

Consider the example of Eastman Kodak. We show Eastman Kodak's

- perating earnings and net income in Exhibit 3.4 over the period 1989–
2011. We calculated operating earnings for this example as the difference between revenues and the sum of cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development costs. The difference between operating earnings and net income is largely the result
- f nonrecurring charges including:
Restructuring costs.

Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
Other income and charges.

There are, of course, recurring charges, including goodwill amortization
(in those years in which permitted), interest expense, and taxes, that result in a difference in these two series. Eastman Kodak had restructuring charges in 18 of these 23 years and in many of these years the charges made
 up the bulk of the difference between operating earnings and net income
### Deferred Taxes

A large difference between reported income and taxable income may suggest the inclusion of revenues or expenses in the reported income that are not recognized for tax purposes in the current period. But examining the difference between accounting net income and taxable income is not possible because the tax returns are not made public. However, examining the sources and changes in deferred taxes—using notes to the financial statements—can provide some clues about how accounting and taxable income diverge.

Differences between income reported in the financial statements and taxable income arise from many sources, including differences in accounting for:

Depreciation

Installment sales

Leases

Warranties

Pensions

It is quite common for companies to report a deferred tax liability or asset, and for this liability or asset to grow over time as the company's earnings and assets grow. What should catch the analyst's attention, however, is when the relationship between reported earnings and taxable income diverges significantly, as indicated by a significant change in the deferred tax liability or asset.

### Goodwill Hunting

The accounting for the combination of companies from mergers and acquisitions is carried out using the _purchase method_, whereby the acquired company's assets are valued at fair value and any excess of the purchase price of the acquired company over this fair value is goodwill, an intangible asset  19

The purchase method requires that assets of the acquired company be revalued, but this is not a straightforward process because many assets, such as intangibles, do not have discernible market price. The possible consequences of using the purchase method include:

Increased cost of goods sold as revalued inventory of the acquired company is sold.

Goodwill created and reported as an asset on the balance sheet.

Depreciation expense may be increased because of increased value for depreciable assets of the acquired company.

Any debt discount resulting from a revaluation of debt must be amortized.

What is goodwill? _Goodwill_ is the difference between the purchase price

- f the acquired company and the fair value of the acquired company's assets. If the difference is positive, as it is most often, the amount is recorded as an intangible asset. Each year, the surviving company evaluates the current balance in goodwill to determine its value. If the value is less than the carrying amount (i.e., the amount reported on the balance sheet), the asset is considered to have an impaired value and goodwill is written down to the current value.
Prior to 2002, companies amortized goodwill over a period not to exceed
40 years. The accounting principles changed with FASB, Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, that requires companies to test the
 goodwill annually for impairment A write-down for impairment would hurt the earnings in the year of the write-down, but would result in improved returns on assets in the future years. This is because the writedown would not affect earnings in years beyond the write-down, yet would result in lower assets in the future years.
Many companies wrote off goodwill beginning in 2002, coinciding with a tough economic period, writing down goodwill during years in which earnings were low. For example, America Online, Inc., and Time Warner,
Inc., merged in 2001, creating AOL-Time Warner Inc. With this merger,
AOL-Time Warner created goodwill of approximately \$99 billion, and wrote down \$54.235 billion of goodwill in 2002—the year after this goodwill was “created” through the merger. In subsequent years, the returns
- n assets are slightly higher than they would have been if there was no write down (e.g., 2.73\% with the write-down vs. 1.89\% without the writedown).
For example, in 2003 and 2004, Yahoo! paid \$2.9 billion to acquire other companies, \$2.1 billion of which was allocated to goodwill and the rest was allocated to tangible assets and amortizable intangible assets (e.g., patents).
In other words, more than 72\% of what it paid for in these acquisitions could not be attributed to identifiable tangible or intangible assets. One of its acquisitions in 2003 was the 290 million paid for Inktomi, with only
49 million attributed to assets of Inktomi. Yahoo!'s goodwill increased to
4 billion by 2007, followed by Yahoo! recognizing goodwill impairment of
487.5 million in 2008.
The perplexing thing about goodwill is that it is really an intangible asset that is truly difficult to identify. If a company pays more for another company than what can be identified as tangible or intangible assets, what type of asset is this? Is it simply the amount by which one company has
_overpaid_ to acquire another company?
Of course, there are some companies that do not wish to take the earnings

“hit” that a write-down in goodwill would entail For example, the value of goodwill is most likely to decline during a recessionary economic environment. However, this is the environment in which companies may be hesitant to report a loss from goodwill impairment that, although a noncash event, would reduce reported net income.
In its study of goodwill impairment, Duff & Phelps—an independent
 22 provider of financial advisory services—found that
Impairments are related to economic declines. For example, during the recent financial crisis, financial service companies had a larger proportion of impairments, compared to other industries.
Impairments tend to follow a decline in performance, with investors anticipating goodwill impairments.
Events that are likely to trigger impairment include legal or regulatory issues, changes in the economic climate, and changes in competition in the company's market.
## TOO MANY CHOICES?

Accounting principles offer choices for companies' management because

- ne method does not fit all companies. For example, Company A's assets may depreciate quickly, whereas Company B's may lose value by a constant amount each period. Therefore, allowing Company A and Company B to choose different methods to better represent their assets' depreciation results in a better quality of financial statement for both companies. However, when do choices become earnings management? This is one of the challenges of analysis.
### Inventory Accounting Choice of Method

The method chosen to account for inventory affects the value of inventory

- n the balance sheet, the cost of goods sold and earnings reported on the income statement, taxable income, and taxes. Therefore, the method affects not only the reported financial statements, but cash flows as well. There are three basic methods of accounting for inventory which differ in the assumptions regarding the cost flow of goods and cost of inventory remaining at the end of the period:
**1.** _FIFO_ ( _first in, first out_ ), which assumes that the first items purchased are the first items sold.
**2.** _LIFO_ ( _last in_, _first out_ ), which assumes that the last items purchased are the first items sold.
**3.** _Average cost_, which assumes that the cost of items sold is the cost of all items purchased.
FIFO assumes that inventory items sold are the ones that have been in inventory the longest, so the cost of the older inventory items is recorded as the cost of goods sold, whereas LIFO assumes that any items sold are the
- nes that have been acquired recently, so the cost of the newer inventory items is recorded as the cost of goods sold. During a period of rising prices,
LIFO produces an estimate of profit that is closest to the true profit, whereas during a period of falling prices, FIFO produces the more accurate estimate of profit. Depending on whether prices are rising or falling, the choice of inventory method affects the values reported in the financial

|statements:|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Comparing Amounts Reported Using FIFO<br>and LIFO for:|During a Period of<br>Rising Prices|During a Period of<br>Falling Prices|
|Inventory on balance sheet|FIFO > LIFO|FIFO < LIFO|
|Cost of goods sold on income statement|FIFO < LIFO|FIFO > LIFO|
|Gross profit on income statement|FIFO > LIFO|FIFO < LIFO|
|Taxes|FIFO > LIFO|FIFO < LIFO|

The average cost method produces estimates that fall somewhere between the values produced by FIFO and LIFO.

The financial analyst must understand also how the choice of inventory method affects the volatility of operating earnings. If selling prices are less flexible than prices of materials, a company's profits will be more volatile with the FIFO method as compared to the LIFO method. As a further note, if a company reduces its inventory substantially during a period and uses

LIFO accounting, there will be an artificial earnings boost from the sale of

- lder, lower-priced inventory.
Because the method of inventory accounting affects the values shown in the financial statements, the financial analyst needs to know where to find the necessary information. In some cases, the company reports the method
- f inventory accounting in the balance sheet alongside the inventory account or, as is often the case, in the note that describes the company's accounting principles (usually Note 1). Additionally, if the company uses
LIFO, an inventory note details the difference in inventory valuations if
FIFO had been used if that difference is material. However, for companies using FIFO for inventory accounting, data necessary to convert FIFO into
LIFO are not made available.
Companies in the same industry may use different methods of accounting for inventory, making comparisons among companies more difficult.
Consider the household products industry. Colgate-Palmolive, KimberlyClark, and Procter & Gamble use both LIFO and FIFO in different proportions. Kimberly-Clark, for example, uses LIFO for U.S. inventories, but FIFO for non-U.S. inventories. Procter & Gamble, on the other hand, uses FIFO for most of their inventory, but uses LIFO for the cosmetics and commodities inventories. The variety in the use of inventory methods makes it challenging for the analyst.
### Write-Downs

Companies are permitted to write-down the value of inventory when the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the inventory. Though healthy companies may experience the need to write-down inventory because of shifts in customer demand, questions arise:

Is the company writing down inventory with the expectation of selling it at a higher profit in future periods?

Is the company not writing down devalued inventory so that they do not dampen earnings?

Either of these cases would not be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, but an analyst needs to ask the right questions in addressing the motive for the write-down.

Questions an analyst may ask about a write-down of inventory include the following:

Is the company writing down its inventory on a timely basis?

What changes in business have caused the loss in value of inventory?

When the inventory is written down, does the company still have possession of the inventory? Will this inventory be sold in future periods?

There are cases of companies writing down inventory in one period and later selling this inventory at a higher profit margin in future periods. For example, the SEC alleges that Sunbeam Corporation wrote down the value

- f perfectly good inventory by 2.1 million in one year, only to sell this
23 inventory in the next period for a 2.1 million greater profit  There are also
23 inventory in the next period for a 2.1 million greater profit  There are also cases in which a company did not write down inventory in a timely manner,
 resulting in an overstatement of earnings for the period
### Depreciation Methods of Depreciation

A company's depreciation expense can have an important effect on the firm's financial statements. Depreciation arises from the firm's investing activities, and it directly affects the firm's reported net income and asset values. The depreciation method and choice of useful life decisions affect the quality of earnings. For example, if assets are more productive in earlier years of their useful lives, the use of an accelerated method provides a higher quality of earnings relative to the use of the straight-line method.

Depreciation allocates the cost of the asset, less residual value, over the expected economic life of the asset. The _economic life_, also referred to as the _useful life_, is the number of years the asset is expected to be of use to the company. The _residual value_, also referred to as the _salvage value_, is the expected value of the asset at the end of its useful life. Depreciation thus provides a means for expensing the portion of the asset's cost that is expected to be used up during its life.

There are three classes of depreciation methods for financial reporting purposes. The first is _straight-line depreciation_, in which an equal amount

- f depreciation expense is taken each period of the asset's useful life. The second, referred to as _accelerated depreciation_, is more rapid depreciation than straight-line resulting in greater depreciation expense in the earlier years of an asset's life. The third class is _units of production_, whereby an estimate is made of the use of the asset (e.g., hours) and then the expense in any period reflects the usage in that period (e.g., number of hours used).
Over the life of the asset, the same amount of depreciation is expensed against income, no matter the method, as we demonstrated in Chapter 2.
However for any given period it makes a difference on the financial statements as to which method a company uses. Accelerated methods produce higher depreciation expense in the earlier years, and hence lower earnings vis-à-vis the straight-line method. Accelerated methods also reduce the carrying value, shown on the company's balance sheet, faster in earlier years.
Most companies use straight-line depreciation for financial reporting purposes, though this does not mean that depreciation is directly comparable among companies because depreciable lives of assets may differ among companies. Limited information on depreciation methods and useful lives is provided in notes to the financial statements. The extent of this type of information varies widely.
### Change in Estimates

The useful life and the salvage value of an asset are simply estimates.

Companies review these estimates and occasionally change them— changing the depreciable life of an asset, whether lengthening or shortening the life, or changing the estimate of salvage value, affects the income statement and balance sheet, and hence the comparability of financial statements in different periods. A financial analyst must be aware of these changes and how they affect any comparisons overtime that are made for a given company.

When a company revises the depreciable life of an existing asset, for example, this is considered a change in accounting estimate. The company is required to account for the change in the period in which it occurs, but it is not permitted to restate prior period's financial accounts retroactively; in

- ther words, the company makes a prospective disclosure, not a
 retrospective disclosure The company is required to disclose the effect on income from continuing operations, net income, and any per-share effect.
Consider a company that is depreciating a 1 million asset, with a
100,000 salvage value, over 20 years. If the company revises the estimate
- f the useful life from 20 to 30 years in the eleventh year of the asset's life, this will lower the depreciation expense from 45,000 per year to
\$22,500 per year in year 11, resulting in higher earnings (by \$22,500) for the years 11 through 20 than with the original estimate. This revision also affects the carrying value of the asset (i.e., cost less accumulated
Exhibit 3.5.
depreciation), as we show in
EXHIBIT 3.5 Example of the Balance Sheet Effect of a Revision in the
Useful Life of an Asset
The recent change in accounting standards with respect to accounting changes should increase the transparency of financial statements with respect to these types of changes, though the disclosures are made only in the year of the change, not the subsequent years. Therefore, the analyst must consider how these changes affect the company's future years' profitability.
### Pension Valuation Assumptions

A _pension plan_ is an agreement under which an employer agrees to pay benefits to employees once the employee's period of service ends. A pension plan may either be a _defined contribution plan_, in which the employer makes only a specified contribution, or a _defined benefit plan_, in which a specific monetary benefit is promised. In the case of a defined benefit plan, these benefits depend on certain requirements specified by the employer, such as the employee's age and number of years of service.

The employer creates a pension fund, which is an intermediary used by the employer to meet the promised obligations. The employer makes payments to the fund and the fund invests these funds and makes pension payments to employees.

In terms of accounting for pension plans, defined contribution and defined benefit plans differ. In a defined contribution plan, accounting for the plan's obligation and assets is easy—the pension cost equals the contributions made and the employer reports an asset or liability reflecting the difference between actual payments made and the required payments. In the case of a defined benefit, the promised payments are not known with certainty and represent a liability because benefits will be paid in the future.

In this case, the employer invests in assets, the plan assets, which are intended to pay off the expected pension liability. The unknowns are:

**1.** _The expected return on plan assets_ . This is a forecast of return on the

 assets set aside to meet the pension obligations

**2.** _The discount rate_ . The discount rate reflects the time value of money with respect to the pension liability.

**3.** _The rate of compensation increase_ . For pension plans in which benefits are provided on the basis of compensation at a future point in time, the rate at which the employees' compensation will increase.

Companies report a pension expense on the income statement and a pension liability on the balance sheet. The pension expense is a result of a calculation that considers employees' earned pension benefits during the period, the time value of money, and the expected return on the pension plan's assets. In addition, companies are required to provide detail in a footnote to their financial statements with respect to the value of assets, the expected liability, and the assumptions used in these calculations, among

- ther things. A recent change in accounting standards now requires companies to explain the basis for estimating the return on plan asset, the discount rate, and the rate of compensation increase (in the case of pay
 related plans) These assumptions are important because they affect both
 related plans) These assumptions are important because they affect both
 the expense and the liability
It is important to understand just what a pension obligation is and how much of it shows up in the liabilities—and how much else there is that is
_not_ reported in liabilities. The pension liability that appears on the balance sheet may not be easy to find. To find the information we need, we must search the footnotes, but we have to know what we are looking for. Once in the footnotes, we have to sift through the various accounts. For example, there are three obligations that may be reported:
**1.** The _accumulated benefit obligation_ (ABO) is the present value of pension benefits earned as of the balance sheet date based on current salaries.
**2.** The _projected benefit obligation_ (PBO) is the present value of pension benefits earned as of the balance sheet date based on projected salaries. This is relevant for plans with benefits that depend on career average or final pay.
**3.** The _vested benefit obligation_ (VBO) is the present value of the pension benefits for employees vested in the pension plan.
Our goal is to find the _funding status_, which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation (or accumulated benefit obligation if the pension obligation is not pay related) and the fair value of plan assets (i.e., the value of assets set aside to meet this obligation). Muddying the waters is the fact that when a company changes its plans, any change in costs is spread (i.e., amortized) over the remaining service life of employees.
Though the accounting rules regarding disclosure were greatly improved in
2007, there remains some pension expense that slips by the income statement and goes directly to shareholders' equity.29
As an example of funding, Ford's pension obligation for U.S. plans as of
2011 was underfunded (i.e., the value of the plans' assets are less than the
- bligation) by \$9.4 billion for the United States and \$6 billion non-U.S. The funded status is negative (i.e., it is _under_ funded), which is represented as a
 component of accrued liabilities Though Ford reported a 2011 pension expense of \$900 million in the retirement benefits footnote, there was also a charge of \$1.19 million to shareholders' equity for employee related benefits that is reported as a component of comprehensive income/(loss) for the year. Despite enhanced disclosures in pension benefits, the analyst must pull information from the statement of shareholders' equity, the accrued liabilities footnote, and the retirement benefits footnote.
~~s~~ 31
Companie may revise the assumptions that they use in the calculation of the benefit obligation and the pension expense. These revisions, which are a change in an accounting estimate, affect the pension expense on the income statement and the liability (or asset) on the balance sheet. The effect each assumption has on the obligation and expense is as follows:
Therefore, if a company tends to use a low discount rate, a return on plan assets that is close to the discount rate, and a high rate of salary increase, it is conservative, and hence its earnings are of higher quality.
Looking at Ford's U.S. pension plan assumptions over time, as we show in Exhibit 3.6(A), we see that the assumptions have changed, most notably the discount rate. We provide the funding status and pension expense for each of these years in Exhibit 3.6(B). You can also see in Exhibit 3.6 that
Ford's pension plan is underfunded in the years 2008–2011; that is, the benefit obligation exceeds the value of the pension assets.
EXHIBIT 3.6 Ford Motor Company U.S. Pension Plan
_Sources:_ Ford Motor Company, 10-K filings, various years.
How do we interpret the effect of the change in the assumptions? The expected change in compensation is, for the most part, fixed by its union contract and, as you can see, was negotiated downward in 2003 and 2006.
However, Ford can change its discount rate or its assumed return on assets.
Consider the discount rate, which was revised downward through the period
1999 through 2004. If nothing else was changed, this would reduce the funding status (that is, make it worse) and increase the pension expense. So why did the pension expense go down in 1999 through 2001? Because the expected return on plan assets increased during this same period. In the
2003–2004 fiscal years, however, the expected return on assets was kept the same, yet both the discount rate and the rate of compensation increase declined; the net result was an increase in the pension expense.
So what's an analyst to do? Dig through the pension and retirement benefits footnote, ferret out the funding status, examine any changes in assumptions and how these affect both the pension expense and the funding status, and examine closely the company's explanation of those changes.
## SO WHAT'S THEIR BUSINESS?

We tend to focus on the basic financial statements in evaluating a company's performance. However, we can learn a lot about a company by taking a look at the reporting on its business segments. Companies are required to report on its business segments, providing profit and loss,

 specific revenue and expense items, and assets attributed to the segment

Companies are also required to provide a discussion of how they determined a business segment.

There are two primary reasons for focusing on business segment results.

First, in terms of making predictions for future periods, it is easier to make predictions for individual segments of a company than for a company as a whole because a company's segments' performance may be affected by different factors. Another reason for focusing on business segments is to assess the quality of earnings. If a company is deriving much of its profits from a business segment that is not its primary segment in terms of the company mission and investment of its assets, then this may suggest that the earnings of the company are not sustainable and/or of lower quality.

Consider the case of Krispy Kreme, the donut retailer and franchiser.

Krispy Kreme went public in 1999 and was the darling of Wall Street as its stock soared. But as its stock soared, its financial condition soured. As we show in Exhibit 3.7, Krispy Kreme derived less of its income over time from its stores and franchise operations, and more from a segment named

“KKM&D.” Taking a closer look at KKM&D in the management discussion and company description, you can see that KKM&D is the segment of Krispy Kreme that sells equipment to the franchisors. By requiring franchisors to purchase the equipment at substantial margins,

Krispy Kreme has increased its revenues and profit. In fiscal year 2003,

Krispy Kreme derived 32\% of its operating income from equipment sales.

However, this is short-lived because once the franchisors have purchased the equipment, this segment will not provide future profit and growth unless additional franchises are sold. As we show in Exhibit 3.7, the portion of revenues from KKM&D diminished in the years following 2003, but then

 increased to close to 36\% of revenues in fiscal year 2010

EXHIBIT 3.7 Sources of Revenues for Krispy Kreme, 1999–2010

## RESTATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

Companies restate their financial results if there was an error in the previously reported results or the company is correcting financial results because of detected fraudulent reporting, a misinterpretation of accounting rules, or aggressive accounting that the company backs away from. For example, Office Depot announced in April 2011 that it was restating its

2010 fiscal year results. This restatement involved an interpretation of a tax loss carryback, and was of sufficient magnitude to change what was a profit to a loss  34

The General Accounting Office (GAO) examined over 1,000 restatements

35 by publicly traded companies during the period 2002 through 2006  The most common reason for restatement in its analysis was related to costs and expenses, which is attributed to the increased emphasis on internal controls and quality of financial statements. Approximately 16\% of companies disclosed a restatement during this period.

Another analysis of restatements, this one by Audit Analytics, examines

 restatements over a 10-year period It provides results that indicate that the number of restatements per year have declined since 2006 and have declined in terms of the degree of restatement. However, “stealth” restatements have remained, and actually reached a peak in 2008. A _stealth_

_restatement_ is a restatement that is disclosed as part of a current financial filing with the SEC, instead of as a separate 8-K filing. Though the SEC is discouraging stealth restatements, they still occur.

The fact that there was an error should at least get the analyst's attention.

Some errors result from a misunderstanding of the application of accounting principles. Some errors result from intentional misapplication of accounting principles. The analyst needs to take a close look at SEC filings to determine the reasons behind the restatement. Another reason to look at restatements is when using data to make predictions of future performance.

The restated data should be more useful in making such predictions.

Consider the case of Overstock.com, Inc., which announced a restatement

- f its 2008 fiscal year results in February 2010. The company disclosed the restatement in their Form 12b-25, the Notification of Late Filing. In this
 filing, the company disclosed that there were numerous accounting errors
Do investors react to restatements? Yes, but the amount depends on the
 type of restatement If the restatement relates to the integrity of the management, the market reaction is most severe. On the other hand, if the restatement is attributed to technical issues, the market reaction is small.
The market reaction to Overstock.com's restatement, which was the third in three years, was minimal, as you can see in Exhibit 3.8(B).
EXHIBIT 3.8 Overstock.com, Inc.
_Source of data:_ Overstock.com Inc., 10-K filings with the SEC; and Yahoo! Finance.
The market reaction to the Overstock.com restatement was not significant, but that is not the case with all restatements. The market reaction to Office Depot's announcement of a restatement of 2010 results after the close of trading on March 31, 2011, was a drop of approximately
Exhibit 3.9.
10\% on the following trading day, April 1, 2011, as we show in

## TELL-TALE SIGNS

There are a number of tell-tale signs that can alert the analyst to actual or potential problems. These signs may be obvious, such as a qualification in an auditor's report, or may require a bit of digging into the numbers, such as an analysis of deferred taxes.

### The Independent Auditor's Opinion

There are many caution flags that financial analysts may heed with regard to the company's independent auditor. In general, the independent accounting firm attests to the audit of the company's financial statements.

There are several different possible results from the engagement of an auditor to review of the company's financial statements:

_An unqualified opinion_ . This is the good news. This means that the auditor believes that the financial statements are presented fairly in conformity with GAAP.

_A qualified opinion_ . This needs further research by the analyst. An auditor issues a qualified opinion when it believes that the financial statements present the company's financial position, results of

- perations, and cash flows in conformity with GAAP, except for some matter that remains qualified. This qualification will be spelled out in
- pinion and will relate to either the scope of the audit, a departure from
GAAP, or doubt about the company continuing as a going concern.
_An adverse opinion_ . This is bad news. An auditor issues an adverse
- pinion when it believes that the financial statements do not present the company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. This opinion is issued when there are significant departures from GAAP.
_A disclaimer of opinion_ . This is bad news too. The auditor issues this
- pinion when it is unable to form an opinion regarding the financial statements.
_s_
_A withdrawal of opinion_ ( ). This is terrible news. In this case, the auditor is withdrawing previously issued opinions because of some egregious situation, such as suspected illegal activities by the audited company.
Most auditors' reports of publicly traded companies' financial statements are unqualified, which means that the auditor is stating that the financial statements are prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles and that these statements present fairly the results of operations.
Occasionally, as the need arises because of changes in accounting principles, an unqualified report may have some explanatory language added. This type of explanation is the result of the changes in accounting principles and is generally not a cause for concern. But any time there is a qualification or any other type of opinion, the analyst must pay close attention.
Another caution flag is an unjustified change in independent auditors or a change in auditor that is the result of a disagreement with the auditor.
Companies may change auditors for a number of reasons. The requirements imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 limit the nonaudit engagements of accounting firms, and hence a shuffling of companies among accounting firms to reduce the possible conflicts of interest related to nonaudit services is expected. However, auditor changes as a result of a
 disagreement are worth looking at
Consider the disagreement between Overstock.com and Grant Thornton in 2009. Grant Thornton was the auditor for less than one year for
Overstock.com  The disagreements became a public squabble, and then were followed by restatements for accounting errors.
As a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the management of public companies must now include in its annual report a report on the company's internal control over financial reporting. The Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board has added this additional responsibility of auditors. This additional requirement is to attest to the management's assessment of the company's internal control over financial reporting. In attesting to the internal controls, the auditor expresses an opinion and notes whether there is a control deficiency, a significant deficiency, or a material weakness with respect to the internal controls.
### Other Signs

There are a number of other warning signs that the financial analyst can look for in the financial information. We list several of these signs in

Exhibit 3.10, though each may not be applicable for every company. For example, examining inventory changes for a company with relatively little inventory (e.g., Walt Disney Company) or examining receivable balances for a company that does not typically extend customer credit (e.g., WalMart Stores) would not be fruitful.

The financial analyst must consider the company's history, the industry in which it operates, and the effects of the economy on the company when analyzing potentially troubling signs. Understanding the company's revenue and expense cycle is important in detecting subtle shifting of these items between periods. Understanding the changes in the company's industry is important for comparisons of the industry's conditions with those of the individual company (e.g., an industry-wide slow-down in customer payments). Understanding the economy and how the company may be affected by current conditions is important for detecting unusual changes in income or assets.

## SUMMARY

The analysis of the financial condition and performance of a company requires understanding the quality of the financial data that is being analyzed. The management of a company has a great deal of room in selecting among accounting methods within the bounds of GAAP, though the changes resulting from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the move toward convergence with Internal Financial Reporting Standards have resulted in fewer degrees of freedom. The analyst must understand the methods selected in order to make comparisons of financial data over time and among companies.

The many accounting choices that a company's management has available

- pen up the possibility for management of earnings and make it more challenging to compare companies and to evaluate trends within a company
- ver time. The devices that management may use include accruals management, revenue and expense recognition, and nonrecurring items.
Financial results may also be affected by the impairment of goodwill, which results in a write-off of this intangible asset, reducing earnings in the period
- f the write-off and reducing total assets in future periods.
The different methods of accounting that a company's management may choose within generally accepted accounting principles creates
- pportunities to manage earnings, making the financial analyst job a bit more challenging. For example, different methods of accounting for inventory and depreciation may make a significant difference in reported asset values and earnings. A careful review of the company's accounting principles is useful in determining the types of adjustments the analyst must make to permit comparability.
Analysts need to examine the sources of a company's revenues and earnings. For example, a company that earns a large portion of its revenues from nonoperating sources or business segments that are not the primary lines of business may indicate potential problems in future earnings.
Analysts also need to be aware of companies' restatements of financial results. In the cases of errors and fraud, companies restate financial results for the periods affected. If we are assessing the market's reaction to financial reports, we would want to use the “as reported” information. On the other hand, as is often the case in financial analysis, we want to make forecasts concerning a company's future financial condition and performance, we should focus on the restated financial results.
An additional consideration for the financial analyst is the auditor's report. The independent accounting firm that audits a company's financial statements and reviews the management's reports on internal controls provides a statement regarding whether the financial statements are prepared according to generally accepted accounting statements and whether the internal controls for financial reporting are sufficient. Careful reading of these reports may reveal important information regarding the financial condition of the company.

I invite you to ask the CFO of a company having a large defined-benefit pension fund what adjustment would need to be made to the company's earnings if its pension assumption was lowered to 6.5\%. And then, if you want to be mean, ask what the company's assumptions were back in 1975 when both stocks and bonds had far higher prospective returns than they do now.”
Buffett goes on to warn corporate management that too high a return on plan assets risks litigation for the CFO, the board, and the auditors.

# Part Two Analysis of Financial Statements
# CHAPTER 4 Financial Analysis

_Financial analysis_ is the selection, evaluation, and interpretation of financial data, along with other pertinent information, to assist in assessing the risk and return associated with an investment. Financial analysis may be used to evaluate the efficiency of operations, the effectiveness of credit policies, and the creditworthiness of a company, among other things.

The analyst draws the financial data needed in financial analysis from many sources. The primary source is the data provided by the company itself in its annual report and required disclosures. The annual report and the

10-K filing include the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows, as well as footnotes to these statements.

Besides information that companies are required to disclose through financial statements, other information is readily available for financial analysis. For example, information such as the market prices of securities of publicly traded corporations can be found in the financial press and the electronic media daily. Similarly, information on stock price indices for industries and for the market as a whole is available in the financial press.

Another source of information is economic data, such as the Gross

Domestic Product (GDP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI), which may be useful in assessing the recent performance or future prospects of a company

- r industry. Suppose you are evaluating a company that owns a chain of retail outlets. What information do you need to judge the company's performance and financial condition? You need financial data, but it doesn't tell the whole story. You also need information on consumer spending, producer prices, consumer prices, and the competition. This is economic data that is readily available from government and private sources.
Besides financial statement data, market data, and economic data, you also need to examine events that may help explain the company's present condition and may have a bearing on its future prospects. For example, did the company recently incur some extraordinary losses? Is the company developing a new product or acquiring another company? Current events can provide information that may be incorporated into financial analysis.
The analyst must select the pertinent information, analyze it, and interpret the analysis, enabling judgments about the current and future financial condition and operating performance of the company. In this chapter, we introduce you to financial ratios—the tool of financial analysis. In financial ratio analysis, we select the relevant information—primarily the financial statement data—and evaluate it. We also show how to calculate and interpret financial ratios and warn you of the pitfalls that occur when they are not used properly. We will be using financial statements of E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) for illustration purposes throughout this chapter. We provide DuPont's 2009 and 2010 balance sheets in Exhibit
4.1 and DuPont's 2009 and 2010 income statements in Exhibit 4.2.

## WHAT ARE FINANCIAL RATIOS AND HOW DO WE USE THEM?

Suppose we wish to evaluate the performance of DuPont. And suppose we

Exhibit 4.3.

gather information about its earnings over time, as we show in

What does this tell us? We learn that DuPont's net income increased over time, with a shift after 1997 and a decline in 2009. But does this tell us anything about whether these earnings are good, considering the capital that the company employs? Not at all.

EXHIBIT 4.3 DuPont Net Income, 1982–2010

_Source of data:_ DuPont, 10-K filings, various years.

And though earnings are growing, is the profit margin constant or changing? We can't tell this from just looking at earnings. This is why in financial analysis we need to examine relations between and among the different accounts and then consider trends over time, how the company fares relative to competitors, and how company-specific events affect the performance and condition of the company.

A tool that we can use to help us examine relations between and among different financial accounts is financial ratio analysis. A financial ratio is simply an expression of the relation between two financial statement accounts and financial ratio analysis is the investigation of a company's condition and performance using one or more of these ratios. We use these ratios to get a measure of the relative value of one account to another. For example, we may want to know how much a company has invested in liquid assets. We can create a measure of this by comparing the current assets of the company—the liquid assets—to the total assets of the company. Or we could compare the current assets of the company with just the noncurrent assets of the company. Either way, we are getting a sense of the relative investment in liquid assets.

The value of a given financial ratio, however, is rarely informative.

Financial ratios provide information when compared to other financial ratios and standards. For example, if we calculate the ratio of the company's current assets to its total assets, and arrive at 20\%, is this good or bad? Does this mean that the company has sufficient liquid assets? We can't tell from this ratio alone. What else would we need to know to gauge whether this is sufficient liquidity for this company? We would want to know, for example, about the company's need for liquidity, whether the company is using its assets in the most effective manner, what is typical for a profitable company in this industry, how its investment in liquid assets has changed over time, and whether the company has debt covenants that require a specific minimum amount of liquid assets.

Once we calculate a financial ratio, we need to put it in perspective with the other aspects of the company's financial condition and performance, both over time and in comparison with other, leading companies in the same industry.

There are more financial ratios than there are different possible combinations of any two balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flow accounts. This means that there are too many to detail in this chapter. What we do in this chapter is focus on the most frequently used financial ratios that analysts use to capture the financial condition and performance of companies. Most of these ratios use balance sheet and income statement data, though a few require market data.

## WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FINANCIAL RATIOS?

We can use financial ratios to examine the different dimensions of a company's financial condition and performance:

_Liquidity_ . How able is the company to satisfy its immediate

  - bligations?
_Activity_ . Is the company getting the most use out of its asset deployment?
_Profitability_ . Is the company efficient in managing its expenses?
_Financial leverage_ . How reliant is the company on debt financing? Is the company expected to be able to satisfy its long-term obligations?
After looking at each of these dimensions, we take a look at return ratios, which bring these measures together in “bottom line” measures of a company's performance. In addition, we examine how we can use return ratios to evaluate how the different aspects of the company's financial condition and performance interact and affect the company's return on investment.
### Liquidity Analysis

Liquidity in the context of financial analysis refers to a company's ability to satisfy its short-term obligations using assets that are most readily converted into cash. We refer to assets that may be converted into cash in a short period of time as _liquid assets_ . These assets are listed in financial statements as _current assets_ . Current assets are often referred to as _working_

_capital_ since they represent the resources needed for the day-to-day

- perations of the company's long-term, capital investments. Current assets are used to satisfy short-term obligations, or current liabilities. The amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities is the company's _net_
.
_working capital_
### The Role of the Operating Cycle

How much liquidity a company needs depends on its operating cycle. The

_operating cycle_ is the duration between the time cash is invested in goods and services to the time that investment produces cash. For example, a company that produces and sells goods has an operating cycle comprising

Exhibit 4.4.

four phases, as we diagram in

EXHIBIT 4.4 The Operating Cycle

The _operating cycle_ is the length of time it takes to convert an investment

- f cash in inventory back into cash through the collections on sales.
Considering that not all purchases a company makes are paid immediately with cash, we can use another cycle metric, the _net operating cycle_, to capture the length of time it takes to convert an investment of cash in inventory and back into cash considering that some purchases are made on credit.
The number of days a company ties up funds in inventory is determined by the:
Total amount of money represented in inventory.
Average day's cost of goods sold.
The current investment in inventory—that is, the money “tied up” in inventory—is the ending balance of inventory on the balance sheet. The average day's cost of goods sold is the cost of goods sold on an average day in the year, which can be estimated by dividing the cost of goods sold found
- n the income statement by the number of days in the year.
We compute the number of days of inventory by calculating the ratio of the amount of inventory on hand (in dollars) to the average day's cost of goods sold (in dollars per day):
If the ending inventory is representative of the inventory throughout the year, the number-of-days-inventory tells us the length of time it takes to convert the investment in inventory into sold goods. Another way of looking at this metric is that it tells us how long the company can continue to generate sales with its existing inventory.
Why do we care about whether the year-end inventory is representative of inventory at any day throughout the year? Because, if inventory at the end
- f the fiscal year is lower than on any other day of the year, we have understated the number-of-days-of-inventory for the year. Most companies try to choose fiscal year-ends that coincide with the slower period of their business, which means that the ending balance of inventory is likely lower than the typical daily inventory of the year. To remedy this, we could look at quarterly financial statements and take averages of quarterly inventory balances to get a better idea of the typical inventory. However, for simplicity in this and other ratios, we make a note of this problem and deal with it later in the discussion of effective use of financial ratios.
We extend the same logic from the inventory turnover to estimate the number of days between a sale—when an account receivable is created—to the time it is collected in cash. If the ending balance of receivables at the end of the year is representative of the receivables on any day throughout the year, then it takes, on average, approximately the number-of-daysreceivable to collect the accounts receivable, or “number-of-days-credit”:
What does the number-of-days-receivable tell us?
Comparing the number-of-days-receivable with the company's credit policy, we can draw conclusions about whether the company is collecting on accounts consistent with their policy.
Comparing the number-of days-receivable of the company with that of its competitors can tell us about whether the credit policy of the company—with respect to both credit granting and collections—is more or less generous than its customers.
Adding the number-of-days inventory and the number-of-days-receivable produces the operating cycle, which is the length of time it takes for the investment of cash in inventory to produce cash through collections of account. What does the operating cycle have to do with liquidity? The longer the operating cycle, the more current assets are needed (relative to current liabilities) because it takes longer to convert inventories and receivables into cash. In other words, the longer the operating cycle, the more net working capital required.
We also need to look at the liabilities on the balance sheet to see how long it takes a company to pay its short-term obligations. We can apply the same logic to accounts payable as we did to accounts receivable and inventories.
How long does it take a company, on average, to go from creating a payable
:
(buying on credit) to paying for it in cash? The _number of days of payables_
First, we need to determine the amount of an average day's purchases on credit. If we assume all purchases are made on credit, the total purchases for the year would be the cost of goods sold, less any amounts included in this
 cost of goods sold that are not purchases
The operating cycle tells us how long it takes to convert an investment in cash back into cash (by way of inventory and accounts receivable):
The number of days of payables tells us how long it takes to pay on purchases made to create the inventory. If we put these two pieces of information together, we can see how long the company ties up cash. The difference between the operating cycle and the number of days of payables is the net operating cycle:
- r, substituting for the operating cycle,
The net operating cycle is an estimate of how long it takes for the company to get cash back from its investment in inventory and accounts receivable, considering that purchases may be made on credit. By not paying for purchases immediately (that is, using trade credit), the company reduces its liquidity needs. Therefore, the longer the net operating cycle, the greater the company's required liquidity. We provide the components of the
Exhibit 4.5.
net operating cycle for DuPont for 2010 in
**EXHIBIT 4.5** Net Operating Cycle Components for DuPont, 2010
### Measures of Liquidity

_Liquidity ratios_ provide a measure of a company's ability to generate cash to meet its immediate needs. The two most commonly used liquidity ratios are the current ratio and the quick ratio. The _current ratio_ is the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. This ratio indicates a company's ability to satisfy its current liabilities with its current assets:

The _quick ratio_ (a.k.a. _acid test ratio_ ) is the ratio of quick assets

(generally current assets less inventory) to current liabilities. This ratio indicates a company's ability to satisfy current liabilities with its most liquid assets:

Generally, the larger these liquidity ratios the better the ability of the company to satisfy its immediate obligations. Is there a magic number that defines good or bad? Not really.

Consider the current ratio. A large amount of current assets relative to current liabilities provides assurance that the company will be able to satisfy its immediate obligations. However, if there are more current assets than the company needs to provide this assurance, the company may be investing too heavily in these nonor low-earning assets and therefore not putting the assets to the most productive use.

Another consideration is the operating cycle. A company with a long

- perating cycle may have more need for liquid assets than a company with a shorter operating cycle. We provide the current and quick ratios for
DuPont for 2010 in Exhibit 4.6.
**EXHIBIT 4.6** Liquidity Ratios for DuPont, 2010
### Activity Ratios

_Activity ratios_ are measures of how well assets are used. Activity ratios can be used to evaluate the benefits produced by specific assets, such as inventory or accounts receivable. Or they can be used to evaluate the benefits produced by all a company's assets collectively. The most common turnover ratios are the inventory turnover, the total asset turnover, and the accounts receivable turnover.

Inventory turnover is the ratio of cost of goods sold to inventory. This ratio indicates how many times inventory is created and sold during the period:

Ideally, the inventory amount in the denominator reflects the average inventory during the period. Because many companies have seasonality in their revenues and fiscal year ends are typically chosen to be at the lowest point of a company's operating cycle, the amount of inventory on a company's annual balance sheet is not representative of the inventory they tend to carry during the year. Therefore, we would want to use an average

2 inventory amount in the calculation of this ratio  However, when we are on the outside looking in, as is often the case in financial analysis, we must use annual inventory or the average of the quarterly inventory to estimate this turnover ratio.

The inventory turnover is an estimate of how many times during the period that inventory is created or purchased and sold. If we are using annual cost of goods sold and an average annual inventory, the ratio is a measure of the number of times inventory is created and sold during the year.

Is any particular number for an inventory turnover ratio good or bad? No, because the appropriate turnover varies by product line. What is important is the interaction of turnover and profitability, which then influence the returns on the company's or owners' investment.

You will notice a relation between the inventory turnover and the number

- f days of inventory:
Suppose a company has cost of goods sold of 100 and an inventory of
10. Then,
The inventory turnover is 10 times.
The number of days inventory is \$10/($100/365) = $10/\$0.274 = 36.5 days.
Inventory turnover × Number of days inventory = 10 × 36.5 = 365.
_Accounts receivable turnover_ is the ratio of net credit sales to accounts receivable. This ratio indicates how many times in the period credit sales have been created and collected on:
The amount of sales on credit in the numerator is an estimate of the amount of sales that the company makes on credit to customers. This amount is not reported on financial statements, though an analyst may estimate this by evaluating the customs of trade credit in the particular industry. The denominator should reflect the average accounts receivable throughout the period.
The accounts receivable turnover is a measure of the number of times accounts receivables have been created—through the sale of goods on credit—and extinguished through customer payments during the period. In
- ther words, this estimate helps us gauge how long it takes customers to pay, on average, during the period. If the turnover is, say, 12 times, we know that it takes customers approximately 30 days to pay on their accounts. This ratio is therefore quite useful in assessing a company's credit policy.
Total asset turnover is the ratio of revenues to total assets:
This ratio indicates the extent that the investment in total assets results in revenues. The resultant number is a multiplier of the revenues that are generated for the investment in total assets. For example, if assets are \$100 million and revenues are \$125 million, the total asset turnover is 1.25, meaning that \$1.25 of revenues are generated per \$1 of asset investment.
As with any other ratio, the total asset turnover cannot be judged in isolation, but rather must be considered in conjunction with other dimensions of the company's condition and performance, the trend of the ratio over time, and industry norms.
A turnover ratio may be constructed to evaluate the use of any set of assets by comparing the gross benefit to the assets employed. For example, if you wish to focus on a company's fixed assets, you can construct a fixed asset turnover as the ratio of revenues to net plant and equipment. We calculate several turnover ratios for DuPont and provide these ratios in
Exhibit 4.7.
The actual values for a given point in time are not very meaningful. What we would want to do in a thorough analysis is compare these turnovers over time for DuPont and compare these values with
DuPont's competitors.
**EXHIBIT 4.7** Activity and Turnover Ratios for DuPont, 2010
### Profitability Analysis

_Profitability ratios_ (also referred to as _profit margin ratios_ ) compare components of income with revenues. They give us an idea of what makes up a company's income and are usually expressed as a portion of each dollar

- f revenues. The profit margin ratios we discuss here differ only by the numerator. It is in the numerator that we reflect and thus evaluate performance for different aspects of the business:
The _gross profit margin_ is the ratio of gross income or profit to revenues. This ratio is a measure of how much of every dollar of revenues is left after costs of goods sold:
The _operating profit margin_ is the ratio of operating profit (a.k.a.
earnings before interest and taxes, EBIT, operating income, income before interest and taxes) to revenues. This is a ratio that indicates how much of each dollar of revenues is left over after operating expenses:
The _net profit margin_ is the ratio of net income (a.k.a. net profit) to revenues, and indicates how much of each dollar of revenues is left
- ver after all expenses:
Profit margins alone do not tell us much about the company's performance or its ability to generate profits in the future. Additional information that we would need include the trend in these profit margins
- ver time, the company's turnover ratios and the trends in these ratios, and the industry norms.
Consider DuPont's profit margins, which we provide in Exhibit 4.8. The gross profit margin appears to be significant. However, DuPont is a chemical company whose costs of its goods are spread primarily between two items: cost of goods sold and the research and development expenses.
Therefore, it is more appropriate in the analysis of DuPont to focus on the
- perating profit margin, rather than the gross profit margin.
**EXHIBIT 4.8** Profit Margins for DuPont, 2010
### Financial Leverage

A company can finance its assets either with equity or debt. Financing through debt involves risk because debt legally obligates the company to pay interest and to repay the principal as promised. On the other hand, equity financing does not obligate the company to pay anything; dividends are paid at the discretion of the board of directors.

There is always some risk, which we refer to as _business risk_, inherent in any operating segment of a business. But how a company chooses to finance its operations—the particular mix of debt and equity, its _capital_

_structure_ - may add financial risk on top of business risk. _Financial risk_ is the extent that debt financing is used relative to equity. The greater the company's use of debt in its capital structure, the greater its risk.

We use financial leverage ratios to assess how much financial risk the company has taken on. There are two types of financial leverage ratios: component percentages and coverage ratios. Component percentages compare a company's debt with either its total capital (debt plus equity) or its equity capital. Coverage ratios reflect a company's ability to satisfy fixed

- bligations, such as interest, principal repayment, or lease payments.
### Component Percentage Financial Leverage Ratios

The component-percentage financial leverage ratios convey how reliant a company is on debt financing:

The _debt-to-assets ratio_ is a measure of the proportion of assets that are financed with interest-bearing obligations (both short-term and longterm debt):

The _long-term debt-to-assets ratio_ is the proportion of the company's assets that are financed with long-term debt:

The _debt-to-equity ratio_, also known as the _debt ratio_, indicates the relative uses of debt and equity as sources of capital to finance the company's assets, evaluated using book values of the capital sources:

The _equity multiplier_, which is the ratio of total assets to shareholders' equity:

In the case of each of these leverage ratios, the greater this ratio, the greater the company's use of financial leverage.

One problem with looking at risk through a financial ratio that uses the book value of equity is that most often there is little relation between the book value and its market value. The book value of equity consists of the:

Proceeds to the company of all the stock issued since it was first incorporated, less any treasury stock (stock repurchased by the company).

Accumulation of all the earnings of the company, less any dividends, since it was first incorporated.

The book value generally does not give a true picture of the investment of shareholders in the company because:

Earnings are recorded according to accounting principles, which may not reflect the true economics of transactions.

Due to inflation, the dollars from earnings and proceeds from stock issued in the past do not reflect today's values.

The market value, on the other hand, is the value of equity as perceived by investors. It is what investors are willing to pay, its worth. So why bother with the book value of equity? For two reasons: First, it is easier to obtain the book value than the market value of a company's securities; second, many financial services report ratios using the book value rather than the market value.

We may use the market value of equity in the denominator, replacing the book value of equity. To do this, we need to know the current number of shares outstanding and the current market price per share of stock and multiply it to get the market value of equity.

### Coverage Ratios

In addition to the financial leverage ratios that use information about how debt is related to either assets or equity, there are a number of financial leverage ratios that capture the ability of the company to satisfy its debt or fixed financing obligations. There are many ratios that accomplish this, but the two most common ratios are the times-interest-earned coverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio.

The _times-interest-earned coverage ratio_, also referred to as the _interest_

_coverage ratio_, compares the earnings available to meet the interest

- bligation with the interest obligation:
The assessment of the coverage of financial obligations may be expanded to include other obligations, for example, a fixed charge coverage ratio can be constructed to include any fixed charges such as lease payments and
 preferred stock dividends For example, to gauge a company's ability to cover its interest and lease payments, you could use the following ratio:
Coverage ratios are often used in debt covenants to help protect the creditors because they require that interest be “covered,” along with a cushion. For example, requiring a two-times interest coverage ratio results in a cushion equal to the interest commitment.
### Recapping

We provide several of the financial leverage measures for DuPont in

Exhibit 4.9 for 2010. These ratios are just a part of the analysis of how reliant a company is on debt versus equity financing. For example, a debtto-assets ratio of 0.254 is neither good nor bad; we would need to put this in perspective, considering DuPont's profitability, tax situation, trends, and business risk, among other factors. We do know that a little over 25\% of its assets are financed with debt, and that DuPont can cover its interest

- bligation seven times over.
**EXHIBIT 4.9** Debt Ratios for DuPont, 2010
### Shareholder Ratios

The ratios we have explained up to this point deal with a company's performance and financial condition. These ratios provide information for managers (who are interested in evaluating the performance of the company) and for creditors (who are interested in the company's ability to pay its obligations). We will now take a look at ratios that focus on the interests of the owners—shareholder ratios. These ratios translate the

- verall results of operations so that they can be compared in terms of a share of stock.
### Earnings per Share

_Earnings per share_ (EPS) is the amount of income earned during a period per share of common stock:

There are two numbers of earnings per share that are currently disclosed in financial reports: basic and diluted earnings per share. These numbers differ with respect to the definition of available net income and the number

- f shares outstanding.
Companies provide information on EPS in their annual and quarterly financial statement information, as well as in their periodic press releases.
Generally, EPS is calculated as net income, divided by the number of shares
- utstanding.
Companies must report both _basic earnings per share_ and _diluted_
_earnings per share_ . These earnings per share calculations replace the previous requirement of simple, primary, and fully diluted EPS.
_Basic earnings per share_ are net income, minus preferred dividends, divided by the average number of shares outstanding. _Diluted earnings per_
_share_ are net income, minus preferred stock dividends, divided by the number of shares outstanding considering all dilutive securities (e.g.,
 convertible debt, options) Diluted earnings per share, therefore, gives the shareholder information about the _potential_ dilution of earnings. For companies with a large number of dilutive securities (e.g., stock options, convertible preferred stock or convertible bonds), there can be a significant difference between basic and diluted EPS. You can see the effect of dilution
- which is minimal—by comparing the basic and diluted EPS for DuPont in Exhibit 4.10.
EXHIBIT 4.10 DuPont's Earnings per Share, 1997-2010
_Source of data:_ DuPont, 10-K filings various years.
### Book and Market Values per Share

The _book value equity per share_ is the amount of the book value (a.k.a.

carrying value) of common equity per share of common stock, calculated by dividing the book value of shareholders' equity by the number of shares

- f stock outstanding. As we discussed earlier, the book value of equity may differ from the market value of equity quite substantially. The market value per share, if available, is a much better indicator of the investment of shareholders in the company.
We can also compare the book value and the market value of a company, forming either the _market-to-book value ratio_ or the _book-to-market value_
_ratio_ . For example,
However, because the book value of equity is such a poor measure of the net assets of a company, this ratio may not be very informative. In the case
- f DuPont, for example, there are many valuable assets that it owns that are not reflected on the balance sheet (i.e., drug patents) and, hence, in the book
 value of equity
### Price-Earnings Ratio

The _price-earnings ratio_ ( _P/E_ or _PE ratio_ ) is the ratio of the price per share

- f common stock to the earnings per share of common stock:
The earnings per share typically used in the denominator are the sum of the earnings per share for the last four quarters. In this case, the P/E ratio is
- ften referred to as the _trailing P/E_ . In contrast, the _leading P/E_ - r
_projected P/E_ ratio is calculated using earnings per share estimated for the next four quarters.
The P/E ratio is sometimes used as a proxy for investors' assessments of the company's ability to generate cash flows in the future. Historically, P/E ratios for U.S. companies tend to fall in the 10 to 25 range. If the company has no or negative earnings, the P/E that you calculate is meaningless.
### Dividend Ratios

A financial analyst is often interested in how much of a company's earnings are paid out to investors. There are two common measures that address this, the dividends per share and the dividend payout ratio. _Dividends per share_

(DPS) are the dollar amounts of cash dividends paid during a period, per share of common stock:

This represents the amount paid out in cash during a given period, but does not reflect noncash distributions such as stock dividends.

Another gauge of dividends is the proportion of earnings that a company pays out in the form of cash dividends: the dividend payout. The _dividend_

_payout ratio_ is the ratio of cash dividends paid to earnings for a period:

The dividend payout ratio is the complement of the _plowback ratio_, which captures the proportion of earnings that are reinvested into the company.

We often describe a company's dividend policy in terms of either its dividend per share or its dividend payout ratio. Some companies' dividends appear to follow a pattern of constant or constantly growing dividends per share. And some companies' dividends appear to be a constant percentage

- f earnings. We provide the dividends per share and dividend payout for
DuPont Inc. in Exhibit 4.11 for the period 1990–2005. DuPont appears to maintain a constant dividend or a dividend that grows slightly in terms of the dividend per share. In terms of the dividend payout, DuPont has a typical payout around 49\%, but the payment of dividends even in loss years
(1992 and 2002) and the payment of dividends when earnings are low
(1993 and 2003) result in a payout ratio that is not level through time.

## ANALYSIS OF RETURN-ONINVESTMENT RATIOS

_Return-on-investment ratios_ allow us to compare benefits generated from investments. The benefit is represented in the numerator, and the resources affecting that benefit, such as the total assets of the company, are

6 represented in the denominator  There are a number of return-on investment ratios available for analysis. We look at three of these return ratios: operating return on assets, return on assets, and return on equity.

### Return Ratios

The _operating return on assets_ is the ratio of operating earnings to assets  7

It is a measure of the operating income resulting from the company's investment in total assets and is useful when comparing companies that are in the same line of business.

The _return on assets_ is the ratio of net income to assets and indicates the company's net profit generated per dollar invested in total assets:

This is a measure of what the company receives, as a whole, from the investment it has made in assets.

The _return on equity_ is the ratio of net income to shareholders' equity and represents the profit generated per dollar of shareholders' investment (i.e., shareholders' equity):

The difference between the return on assets and the return on equity is the investment that is considered; the return on equity is affected by the capital structure of the company:

The ratio of total assets to shareholders' equity is the _equity multiplier_, a measure of a company's use of financial leverage: the greater the use of debt, vis-à-vis equity, the greater the equity multiplier. Therefore, the greater the use of debt, the greater the difference between the return on assets and return on equity for a given fiscal period.

We can also be more specific in terms of the type of equity. For example, we can construct a _return on common equity_, which is the ratio of net income available to common shareholders to common shareholders' equity:

This return is the profit generated per dollar of common shareholders' investment (that is, common shareholders' equity).

We provide the calculated values of these return metrics in Exhibit 4.12 for DuPont. As we shall see shortly, we can relate these “bottom line” measures of performance to the different financial aspects of the company's financial performance and condition.

**EXHIBIT 4.12** Return on Investment Ratios for DuPont, 2010

An additional return to consider is the _return on invested capital_ . Simply put, it is income from operating activities, less related taxes, divided by invested capital. _Invested capital_ is the sum of all of the sources of longterm funding of the company, including equity and interest-bearing debt.

However, because the numerator and denominator of this return are not reported directly on the financial statements, we must first calculate these amounts using reported accounts, making some assumptions.

The numerator is the after-tax operating income, also referred to as _net_

_operating profit after taxes_ (NOPAT). One approach is to start with net income and then add nonrecurring costs, interest expense, and taxes paid on investment and interest income. We could also start with operating income and then subtract estimated taxes on operating income. We have to make some assumptions regarding the last item in this calculation, whether we

 calculate this starting with net income or operating income Generally, we use the effective tax rate (given in a footnote to the financial statements).

Starting with operating income and using the effective rate of tax of 19\%, as provided in DuPont's Note 5 to its 2010 financial statement, we calculate

- perating profit after taxes of:
Operating income 4,301
Less: taxes on operating income, at 17.758\% 764
Operating income after taxes 3,537
The invested capital for DuPont is all permanent sources of capital ~~,~~
Interest bearing short-term debt 132
Long-term debt 10,137
Shareholders' equity 9,278
Total capital 19,547
The return on invested capital for DuPont in 2010 is therefore:
The return on invested capital is a measure of the company's ability to put all its financial capital to work, regardless of how the company chooses to finance its assets; generally, the greater the return on invested capital, the better the performance of the company.
### The DuPont System

The DuPont system was developed by E.I. DuPont Nemours as a means of relating the company's performance to specific aspects of the management

- f the company. In its simplest form, this system is a method of breaking down the return ratio into its profit margin and turnover components.
Suppose the return on assets changes from 20\% to 10\%. We do not know whether this decreased return is due to a less efficient use of the company's assets—that is, due to lower activity—or to lower profit margins. A lower return on assets could be due to lower activity, lower margins, or both.
Because we are interested in evaluating past operating performance to evaluate different aspects of the management of the company or to predict future performance, knowing the source of these returns is valuable information. The DuPont system allows us to break down the return ratios into components, identifying the sources of the changes in returns.
For example, we can break down the operating return on assets and the
 10 return on assets both into two components, margin and turnover
By looking at the components, turnover and profit margin, and their changes from year to year, we get a better idea of what is behind changes in returns from year to year. Similarly, the return on shareholders' equity can be broken down into three components:
We can break down any return ratio into its components, reducing the ratio to their smallest components. For example, the return on equity can be broken down into five components: asset turnover, operating profit margin, fixed financial charge burden, tax burden, and financial leverage, as we demonstrate in Exhibit 4.13 in equation form and in Exhibit 4.14 using
DuPont's 2010 return on equity components.
EXHIBIT 4.13 The DuPont Breakdown of the Return on Assets
**EXHIBIT 4.14** The Return on Equity For DuPont for 2010, Broken Down into Components Using the DuPont System
We can use the DuPont system to diagnose the source of change in returns
- ver time. Consider Borders, a book retailer that operated Borders and
Waldenbooks retail stores. Borders filed for bankruptcy on February 16,
We graph Borders' return on assets in Exhibit 4.15(A). As you can see, the company was generating losses beginning in 2006. What was the source
- f Border's woes? There is usually not just one source of a company's financial difficulties, but using the DuPont system allows us to get some idea of what led to Border's challenges.
EXHIBIT 4.15 Border's Path to Bankruptcy
_Source of data_ : Border's, 10-K filings, various years.
Looking at its asset turnover and net profit margin for the 15 years leading up to bankruptcy, as we show in Exhibit 4.15(B), we can begin getting an idea of what led to its problems.
We can see in Exhibit 4.15(B) that the total asset turnover did not change much through 2007, and increased after that fiscal year. Looking at Border's net profit margin, as shown in Exhibit 4.15(C), we see that the changes in the net profit margin appear to have been a strong influence on Border's returns.
What does this mean? What we surmise from this analysis is that Border's difficulties are related to the management of expenses. If we wanted to get a more detailed look, we could break the net profit margin into components
- f the operation profit margin, the interest burden, and the tax burden to see why the net profit margin changed over time. We may also want to investigate further why the asset turnover changed dramatically after 2007, focusing specifically on Border's inventory turnover.
## HOW CAN WE USE COMMON-SIZE ANALYSIS TO ANALYZE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS?

_Common-size analysis_ is the analysis of financial statement items through comparisons among these items. In common-size analysis, we compare each item in a financial statement with a benchmark item:

For the income statement, the benchmark is revenues. For a given period, each item in the income statement is restated as a percentage of revenues.

For the balance sheet, the benchmark is total assets. For a given point in time, each item in the balance sheet is restated as a percentage of total assets.

To see how this works, consider DuPont's financial statements. We have restated the income statements for 2009 and 2010 in Exhibit 4.16, restating

 each income statement item as a percentage of revenues In an analysis of this statement, we focus on the changes from year to year, looking for explanations for changes in company-specific events, economic, and market events.

|Income tax|2.013\%|1.519\%|
|Net income|9.260\%|6.422\%|

The common size analysis of an income statement over several periods gives us an idea of how the company's management of its expenses changes from one period to the next.

In a similar manner, we can restate each balance sheet item as a percentage of total assets and then make year-to-year comparisons.

Examining changes in the asset composition tells us about how the company is altering its investments; examining changes in the liabilities and equity tells us about how the company is altering its capital structure.

## INTEGRATED RATIO ANALYSIS

Financial analysis requires pulling together many pieces of information.

Analysis of a company requires gathering information that includes:

A description of the company, including its line(s) of business, and major corporate events, such as acquisitions and divestitures.

The industry or industries in which it operates and its major competitors.

Major factors (e.g., economic, competitive, or legal) that have affected the company in the recent past and may affect the company going forward.

Relevant financial ratios for at least the past 5 years, but preferably the past 10 years.

Common-size analysis over the past 5 to 10 years.

A thorough analysis of a company would require more space than we can allow here, but we can present the basic financial ratio analysis and common-size analysis. We use DuPont as an example, using published annual financial data.

### Company Description, Industry, and Major Factors

E. I. DuPont De Nemours and Company is a company's whose main business line is chemicals, but the company has a significant investment in agriculture and biotechnology, and considers itself to be a science and technology focused company. We provide a breakdown of DuPont's

Exhibit 4.17.

revenues by reported segment in

EXHIBIT 4.17 DuPont's 2010 Revenues by Segments, in Billions

_Source of data_ : DuPont, 2010 10-K filing.

### Its Industry

DuPont's primary line of business is chemicals, but it could very well be described as a conglomerate because of its lines of business extending into agriculture (e.g., seeds), electronics (e.g., cell phone displays) and safety and protection, with well-known products including Teflon, Corian, and

Kevlar.

If we look at the chemical industry globally, we see that DuPont is a significant U.S. participant in this industry, but the industry is dominated by

Exxon Mobil, which is an oil and gas company with significant specialty chemical and research segments. We provide a breakdown of the industry

Exhibit 4.18.

by the major players in Other large competitors who have major chemical segments include Hitachi and LG. Likely the most comparable company is Dow Chemical, which is a large U.S. chemical company.

EXHIBIT 4.18 Chemical Industry, 2010

_Source of data:_ 10-K filings.

Interpreting trends in ratios requires understanding the primary events that affect the company's performance and condition. Major events affecting

DuPont's financial history include:

DuPont acquired Conoco, Inc. in 1981. This acquisition provided a key products. Due to a bidding war for Conoco, Seagram's Company became a major shareholder in DuPont through its holdings of Conoco.

source of petroleum, which is an ingredient in many of DuPont's

DuPont bought these holdings from Seagram in 1995, and then divested itself of Conoco in transactions in 1998 and 1999. The acquisition of Conoco and its subsequent divestiture, changed the product mix of DuPont and, as you will see, its financial complexion.

DuPont's many products from its research affected its fortunes. DuPont introduced Stainmaster™ in 1986, replacement refrigerants for ozonedepleting refrigerants starting in 1990, Sorona™ polymer in 2000, and

Solae™ soy protein in 2001, to name a few.

In 2000, DuPont sold its DuPont Textiles and Interiors division, which produces material with the DuPont developed Lycra, Stainmaster™,

Coolmax™, and other specialty fibers.

DuPont's revenues, especially after 1999, are seasonal, with the highest revenues in the first quarter of a year and the lowest in the third quarter, as

Exhibit 4.19.

you can see in The drop in revenues in the first quarter of

1997 is due to a number of factors, including DuPont's exit from a number

- f joint ventures and a downturn in prices of its products.
EXHIBIT 4.19 Seasonality In DuPont's Revenues, First Quarter 1982
Through Fourth Quarter 2010
_Source of data_ : DuPont, 10-Q filings.
### Financial Ratios Liquidity

We provide a graph of DuPont's liquidity ratios in Exhibit 4.20. The current and quick ratios follow similar trends over the years 1990–2010, with a drop-off in the years 1995–2000, but a recovery following the Conoco divestiture.

EXHIBIT 4.20 Liquidity Ratios of DuPont, 1982–2010

_Source of data:_ DuPont, annual reports, various years.

The difference between the quick and current ratios is the numerator, where the quick ratio excludes inventory. If the distance between the quick and current ratios changes over time, as it does with DuPont, this indicates a changing importance of inventory in current assets over time.

### Activity

We provide the turnover ratios for DuPont for the years 1982–2010 in

Exhibit 4.21.

The change after 1997 indicates the change in the company's product mix with the divestiture of Conoco.

EXHIBIT 4.21 Activity Ratios of DuPont, 1982-2010

_Source of data_ : DuPont, annual reports, various years.

### Profitability

As you can see in Exhibit 4.22, the profit margins of DuPont have increased

- ver time, with the drop-off in the 2003 fiscal year, which may be attributed, in part, to changes in product mix from merger-related activities.
EXHIBIT 4.22 Profitability Ratios of DuPont, 1982–2010
_Source of data_ : DuPont, annual reports, various years.
### Financial Leverage

DuPont's use of debt has varied over the period 1990–2010, as we show in

Exhibit 4.23, with a general increase in the latter years. These two ratios, the long-term debt to assets and the equity multiplier, both provide information regarding the relative use of debt, but provide slightly different information: the equity multiplier includes the effects of both shortand long-term liabilities, whereas the long-term debt-to-assets ratio includes

- nly debt and only the long-term portion.
EXHIBIT 4.23 DuPont's Financial Leverage Ratios, 1982–2010
_Source of data:_ DuPont, annual reports and 10-K filings, various years.
A company's debt rating is affected by its ability to handle its debt
- bligations. DuPont's debt is A-rated by Fitch and Standard & Poor's, and
A2 by Moody's. An A rating is considered investment grade.
DuPont's short-term borrowing is rated P-1 by Moody's, A-1 by Standard
12 and Poor's, and F-1 by Fitch  This indicates that DuPont's short-term
- bligations have minimal credit risk.
### Return and the DuPont Analysis

We plot the return on equity and return on assets for DuPont for the years

1982–2010 in Exhibit 4.24. Both the return on assets and the return on equity are wide-ranging during these years.

EXHIBIT 4.24 Return on assets and return on equity for DuPont, 1982–

_Source of data_ : DuPont, Annual Reports and 10-K filings, various years.

We provide a breakdown of the return on equity into the three components of net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage, and

Exhibit 4.25.

graph these components in The DuPont breakdown suggests that the increased volatility of returns in the post-1999 period are attributed to the more volatile efficiency in managing expenses, as represented by the net profit margin.

EXHIBIT 4.25 DuPont Components for DuPont, 1982–2010

_Source of data:_ DuPont, annual report and 10-K filings, various years.

### Other Factors

The other factors that we look at for a company depend on, for example, the company's line or lines of business, its position in the industry, government regulation and changes thereof, major acquisitions and divestitures, and the sensitivity of its profitability to changes in the economic environment.

DuPont depends on its development of new products and patents, so one aspect of this company that we look at is its research and development

(R&D). We present DuPont's R&D as a percentage of revenues in Exhibit

4.26.

As you can see, the relation between R&D and revenues changed as the company acquired and then divested itself of Conoco. Before Conoco, the typical R&D expenditure was around 3\% of revenues, whereas after

Conoco, it was around 5\%.

EXHIBIT 4.26 DuPont's R&D as a Percentage of Revenues, 1982-2010

_Source of data_ : DuPont, annual report and 10-K filings, various years.

### Common-Size Analysis

We can gain another perspective of the company's performance and condition through a common-size analysis of the income statement and balance sheet. We provide the common size income statement in Exhibit

4.27 and the common size balance sheet in Exhibit 4.28.

EXHIBIT 4.27 Common-Sized Income Statements, DuPont Company,

1982–2010

_Source of data_ : DuPont, annual reports, various years.

EXHIBIT 4.28 Common-Sized Balance Sheet, DuPont Company, 1982–

_Source of data_ : DuPont, annual reports, various years.

In Exhibit 4.27, we can see the trends in the expenses and net income of the company. With the exception of 2003, we can see that the operating costs have declined over time. The effects of the mergers, in terms of merger-related expenses, can be seen in the change in the non-operating expenses in 2003 and 2010.

We can also see effects of the mergers in the common size balance sheets, as we show in Exhibit 4.28(A).

## WHAT ARE THE PITFALLS AND PRATFALLS OF FINANCIAL RATIO
## ANALYSIS?

It is an easy matter to obtain and manipulate financial data. But the important and more challenging task of making sense out of all the analysis remains. There are numerous issues that arise in analyzing and comparing financial ratios across time and across companies. These issues include:

The use of accounting data, which is generally stated using historical costs.

Selecting the ratios to analyze and interpreting ratios appropriately for the company and the industry.

Choosing a benchmark for comparisons, whether the industry as a whole, major competitors, or some set of aspirant or competing companies.

The use of ratios in forecasting future performance.

### The Use of Accounting Data

There are a number of issues that arise simply from the fact that much of the financial data we use in analysis is accounting information. The problems associated with using reported accounting data include:

_Use of historical costs and inflation_ . Accounting data are not adjusted for inflation and represent historical cost instead of current or replacement costs for most assets. It is likely that the reported book value of assets do not reflect the market value or replacement value of a company's assets.

_Different methods of accounting_ . Companies may select from alternative accounting procedures (e.g., LIFO vs. FIFO), which makes comparisons among companies difficult. The analyst must often look beyond the basic financial statement information to remove distortions that may arise from specific accounting practices.

_Changes in accounting principles_ . Accounting principles change over time.

_The occurrence of extraordinary and special items_ . The analyst must determine whether the effects of extraordinary and special items should be included in the analysis. In recent years, extraordinary items have become quite “ordinary,” with some companies reporting extraordinary items each year.

_The difficulty in classifying “fuzzy” items._ Some accounting items are difficult to classify, especially when distinguishing between liabilities and equity accounts. Therefore, the analyst must understand not only the accounting principles behind the numbers, but also understand business practices. For example, in the case of deferred taxes, the analyst must understand not only what gives rise to deferred taxes, but whether this accounting item represents an ongoing difference between tax and accounting income (and, hence, is more suitably classified as equity) or whether this item represents a temporary timing difference

(and, hence, is more suitably classified as a liability).

_Restatements._ Financial statements are restated occasionally due to errors or, unfortunately, fraud. When analyzing a company that has restated its financial statements, questions arise with regard to what data to use. As reported? As restated? Generally, when making forecasts of the company's future performance and condition, we would want to use the corrected data  13

### Selecting and Interpreting Ratios

Interpretation of ratios one at a time is difficult since there is no “good” or

“bad” value when viewed in isolation. Ratios should be selected that have meaning for that company. For example, inventory turnover for DuPont is not very meaningful because the investment in inventory is of little consequence for a pharmaceutical company. But inventory turnover is very important for, say, a retailer such as Wal-Mart. And whereas investment in

R&D is important for DuPont, this is much less so for Wal-Mart Stores.

Further, some ratios do not make sense under certain circumstances. For example, if a company has negative earnings, the price-earnings ratio is meaningless. As another example, consider a company that has negative book value of equity (and, yes, this can happen). In this case, any ratio that uses book value of equity, such as the debt-equity ratio, is meaningless.

### Choosing a Benchmark

To make comparisons, the analyst most likely will want to compare the company with other companies. But identifying the other companies in the same or similar lines of business presents a challenge. A system that has been used for many years for classifying companies by lines of business is the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, which was developed by the Office of Management and Budget. However, starting in 1997, another classification system, North American Industry Classification

System (NAICS), replaced SIC codes with a system that better represents the current lines of business. Using the NAISC, we can classify a company and then compare this company with others of that class.

Classifying companies into industry groups is difficult because most companies have more than one line of business. Most large corporations

- perate in several lines of business. Do we classify a company into an industry by the line of business that represents the:
Most sales revenue generated?
Greatest investment in assets?
Greatest share of the company's profits?
It is not clear which is the most appropriate method and a company may be classified into different industries by different financial services and analysts.
In making comparisons, there is an issue of whether the benchmark should be all other companies in the industry (say, an average), or the leading companies in the industry. Consider the case of DuPont. DuPont is a manufacturer of basic chemicals. The primary U.S. competitor is Dow
Chemical, though there are also a number of smaller competitors such as
Union Carbide, Georgia Gulf, and Millennium Chemicals, and a number of large global companies such as LG. When comparing DuPont to the industry:
Should we include two major competitors as the industry benchmark?
If so, do we simply average Dow Chemical and Union Carbide's ratios
  or do we weight them in some manner (e.g., by market share)?
Should we consider the smaller competitors at all?
Should we compare DuPont with the largest or the most profitable company in the industry?
The benchmark that we choose may affect the conclusions that we draw with respect to a company's operating performance.
### Using Ratios in Forecasting

We often examine trends in ratios and other financial data to predict the future, forecasting the future based on historical trends. For example, we may extrapolate a trend in revenues or a trend in operating profit. And though this may result in a reasonable forecast for the immediate future, the business environment is very complex and many factors can affect the future performance or conditions of a company.

Consider forecasting DuPont's revenues for 2010 and beyond, based on net income data from 2000–2009. We begin by estimating the trend in the

Exhibit 4.29.

revenues over this period, as we graph in Revenues appear to follow a linear path through these years, as we show in this exhibit, with an interruption in 2009. The influence of 2009 is apparent on the forecasted revenues. The forecasted revenues understate the actual 2010 revenues by

2,415 million.

EXHIBIT 4.29 Forecasting DuPont's Revenues for 2010 Based on

Revenues for 2000-2009

_Source of data:_ DuPont, annual reports and 10-K filings, various years.

Had we included the data all the way back to 1982, our forecast would have been less accurate. This is because the pattern of revenues, especially influenced by its acquisitions and divestitures over the entire 28-year period

 is not as representative of DuPont in the more recent years This is why we develop forecasts using information in addition to the basic trends, such as forecasts of company-specific events, as well as economic and market conditions.

But we need to be careful in predicting the future revenues or income of a company based solely on the past. As companies mature, growth slows and this needs to be considered in making any forecasts. How much does growth slow? It depends on many factors, including industry structure (e.g., degree of competition), changing demographics, and government regulation.

## SUMMARY

Financial analysis of a company requires a wealth of information. Now that so much information is available—and that so much of the analysis can be accomplished with a personal computer—the real challenge for the analyst is to select the appropriate tools, gather the pertinent information, and interpret it.

Financial ratio analysis requires understanding the accounting information that is used in these ratios. In addition to calculating financial ratios, the analyst must look at company and industry specific information that helps explains the trends and changes in trends that the financial ratios may reveal. In addition to the company and industry analysis, the financial analysis must also be able to put the analysis of the financial ratios in context of the economy in general.

Analysis is becoming more important following the recent scandals as investors and financial managers are learning to become more skeptical of accounting information and look more closely at trends in data, comparisons with other companies, the relation between management compensation and earnings, and footnote disclosures. It is not necessarily the case that all of the scandals could have been detected with closer scrutiny, but there were warning signs in the trends and hints in footnotes that should have at least raised the caution flags among analysts.

**C.** 1.25 times and 50\%.
**10.** Common size income statements provide which of the following ratios?
**A.** Activity ratios
**B.** Profitability ratios
**C.** Financial leverage ratios
1. For example, depreciation is included in the cost of goods sold (COGS), yet it is not a purchase. However, as a quick proxy for purchases, we can use the accounting relationship: Beginning inventory + Purchases =
COGS + Ending inventory.
2. This is the case for most every ratio that involves the balance in an account that is seasonal, such as inventory and accounts receivable.
3. If you include an obligation in the denominator that is paid out of aftertax earnings, such as preferred stock dividends, you need to gross-up these
- bligations to place them on a pre-tax basis by dividing the obligation by a factor equal to one minus the tax rate.
4. If dilutive securities have obligations, such as interest, that may affect the earnings available to shareholders, these obligations are added back to the numerator in the diluted EPS calculation.
5. For example, DuPont's market value of equity in July 2005 was at least three times its book value.
6. What distinguishes return-on-investment ratios from the activity ratios
(such as an inventory turnover or receivable turnover) is that the numerator is the net benefit, rather than the gross benefit from an activity.
7. This ratio is also referred to as the .
_basic earning power ratio_
8. In the case of a company that incurs a rental expense, we generally capitalize the value of the operating leases and include this value as capital. We would also adjust net income for the after-tax effect of the implied interest on the operating lease. In past years in which goodwill was amortized, we would also add back that amortization to net income.
9. Because we are interested in the total capital invested, we include shortterm interest bearing debt in the amount of capital invested.
10. An easy way to remember the DuPont breakdowns is to keep in mind that cross-cancellation of terms will produce the desired return. For example,
11. For presentation purposes, we have grouped several reported items and have rounded the percentages.
12. P-1 is the highest rating by Moody's, and A-1 and F-1 are the secondhighest ratings for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, respectively.
13. Of course, if the restatement is made as a result of detected fraudulent reporting, the analyst would want to take a very close look at _why_ the company's management had to restate the data, in other words, what were they hiding?
14. The forecast error using the 28-year period 1982–2009 instead of the most recent 10 years is 3,664 million.
# CHAPTER 5 Equity Analysis

What determines the market price of a share of common stock? Like anything, price depends on what people are willing to pay. The price of a share of stock today depends on what investors believe is today's value of all the cash flows that will accrue in the entire future from that share of stock. In other words, no one is going to pay any more today for a share of stock than they think it is worth—based on what they think they will get out

- f it in terms of future cash flows. What people are willing to pay for a share of stock today determines its market value.
The theory of stock prices makes sense. If we could accurately forecast a company's cash flows in the future, we could determine the value of the company's stock today and determine whether the stock is overor undervalued by the market. But forecasting future cash flows is difficult. As an alternative, what is typically done is to examine the historical and current relation between stock prices and some fundamental value, such as earnings
- r dividends, using this relation to estimate the value of a share of stock.
In this chapter, we take a closer look at the fundamental factors of earnings and dividends and their relations with share price, as expressed in such commonly used ratios as the price-earnings ratio and the dividend yield.
## EARNINGS

A commonly used measure of a company's performance over a period of time is its earnings, which is often stated in terms of a return—that is, earnings scaled by the amount of the investment. But earnings can really mean many different things depending on the context:

If an analyst is evaluating the performance of a company's operations, the focus is on the operating earnings of the company—its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).

If the analyst is evaluating the performance of a company overall, the focus is upon net income, which is essentially EBIT less interest and taxes.

If the analyst is evaluating the performance of the company from a common shareholder's perspective, the earnings are the earnings available to common shareholders—EBIT less interest, taxes, and preferred stock dividends.

If the analyst is forecasting future earnings and cash flows, the focus is

  on earnings from continuing operations.
Therefore, it is useful to be very specific in the meaning of “earnings.”
### Can Earnings Be Managed?

As we discussed in a previous chapter, there is a possibility that reported financial information may be managed by the judicious choice of accounting methods and timing. In particular, earnings can be managed using a number of devices, including the selection of inventory method

(e.g., FIFO vs. LIFO) and the selection of the depreciation method and

 depreciable lives The possibility of earnings management exists, so the burden is on the financial analyst to understand a company's financial reporting, accounting methods, and the likelihood of manipulation.

There are many pressures that a company may face that affect the likelihood of management. These pressures include:

Executive compensation based on earnings targets.

Reporting ever-increasing earnings, especially when the business is subject to variations in the business cycle.

Meeting or beating analyst forecasts.

Earnings targets come in various forms, but typically schemes on earnings targets provide for a bonus if earnings meet or exceed a specified target such as a return on equity.

One-sided incentives such as this—rewards for beating the target return, but no penalty for not making the target—create problematic situations.

Combine this with the tendency of stock prices to be affected by whether or not analysts' forecasts are met or beat, and there is significant potential for problems.

If, for example, management knows that the earnings target cannot be met in a period, there may be an incentive to either (1) manage earnings, through such mechanics as accruals, changes in estimates, or changes in accounting method, or (2) take large write-offs in that period, increasing the chances of making earnings targets in future periods—referred to as taking a “big bath.”

Meeting analysts' forecasts presents still another pressure for the management of earnings. We know from the wealth of empirical evidence that stock prices react to earnings surprises, where surprises are defined as a

2 difference between expected and actual earnings  Because there is a market

2 difference between expected and actual earnings  Because there is a market reaction to surprises—negative for earnings less than expected and positive for earnings better than expected—companies have an incentive to manage earnings to meet or exceed forecasted earnings. Frustrating the efforts to beat analysts' forecasts is the tendency of analysts to be overly optimistic

 about earnings In fact, the overestimation of earnings is more pronounced

 about earnings In fact, the overestimation of earnings is more pronounced in cases in which companies report negative earnings.

The pressure to report constant or constantly increasing earnings may also result in earnings management, manipulation, or, in extreme cases, even fraud. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged executives

- f Gateway with failing to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. In its third quarter of 2000, Gateway met analysts' expectations for earnings per share of \$0.46 by overstating earnings by \$0.10 per share.
As another example, in 2010, the SEC charged Dell and some of its executives with fraudulent accounting that was an attempt to meet investors'
 expectations of earnings Dell had relied on payments from Intel, payments in exchange for not using a rival's CPU, for much of its profitability in some years, and did not disclose this nor explain that an earnings decline was not due to operations, but rather Intel no longer making these payments.
Evidence suggests that there is a strong incentive to meet analysts' forecasts:
More companies meet or beat earnings forecasts than miss these forecasts  5

Stock prices are sensitive to whether earnings meet analysts' forecasts
Managers are more likely to sell their shares of the company's stock after meeting or beating forecasts, than if the company fails to meet forecasts  7
As a result of these incentives, the financial analyst must not only look for unusual patterns in earnings, but also earnings that are perhaps _too_
 predictable
You can see support for the idea of gamesmanship in earnings in a study
 by Grundfest and Malenko They focused on earnings per share and
- bserved that the number “4” occurred less often in the tenth of a cent position than any other number and what would occur by chance. They also
- bserved that for those companies that are required to restate their earnings, they were even less likely to report a “4” in the tenth of a cent position. This study supports the notion that companies desire to round up earnings, especially when the companies are close to meeting analysts' forecasts.
Even with the potential for managed earnings, is there a relation between earnings and stock value? Consider Dell, Inc.'s earnings and market value
Exhibit 5.1.
- f equity over the period 1990–2010, as we show in As you can see, the market value of Dell's common stock moves along in tandem with
Dell's cash flow from operating activities. You will also notice that the relation between market value and net earnings is not as strong as that with cash flow from operating activities. This is likely because investors look beyond earnings in their valuation of future cash flows and focus on sustainable, continuing cash flows. Can cash flows be manipulated? It is much more difficult to manipulate cash flows compared to earnings.
However, in Dell's case and the problem with its disclosures, as we mentioned previously, is the issue regarding the source of the earnings and cash flows, not the amount. Therefore, Dell did not manage earnings or cash flows, but rather managed investors' perceptions of the source and sustainability of these earnings and cash flows.
EXHIBIT 5.1 Dell Computer's Earnings and Market Value of Equity, 1990–
_Source of data:_ Dell, 10-K filings and annual reports, various years.
Though the example using Dell illustrates the relationship for one company over a specific range of years, the issue is whether earnings and market value are related for most companies. The research into the relation between earnings and value concludes the following:
Stock prices change in response to an announcement of unexpected earnings.
Accounting earnings are correlated with stock returns, especially returns measured over a long horizon following the release of
 earnings
The strong relation between earnings and stock prices may be due to reported earnings being strongly correlated with true earnings (that is, earnings in absence of management). Or the earnings–stock price relation may be due to stocks' valuation being dependent on _reported_ earnings.
### Pro Forma Earnings

Pro forma financial information is really a misnomer—the information is neither pro forma (that is, forward looking), nor reliable financial data.

What is it? As we explained in Chapter 2, it is “creative accounting” that started during the Internet–tech boom of the 1990s and persists today:

Companies release financial information that is prepared according to their

- wn liking, using accounting methods that they create. Why did companies start doing this? What's wrong with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)?
During the Internet–tech stock boom, many start-up companies quickly went public and then felt the pressures to generate profits. However, profits in that industry were hard to come by during that period of time. What some companies did is generate financial data, included in company releases, that reported earnings that were not determined by GAAP but rather by methods
- f their own. In some cases, these alternative methods hid a lot of the ills at these companies.
We can see this in Exhibit 5.2 for Sabre Holdings, parent of Travelocity.
Sabre Holdings began to provide “adjusted” (a.k.a. pro forma) earnings per share in the second quarter of 1999 in their press releases, initially ignoring
- ption expense. Eventually, the adjusted EPS ignored much more, including
- ne-time work reduction costs and the amortization of intangibles. In fact, in a couple of the quarters, the adjusted EPS was positive when the GAAP
EPS was negative. It wasn't until the second quarter of 2002 that Sabre began presenting both GAAP and adjusted EPS in the press releases; on and after which time the GAAP and adjusted became quite similar.
EXHIBIT 5.2 Examples of Pro Forma vs. GAAP Earnings for Sabre
Holdings
_Source of data:_ Sabre Holdings, 10-Q filings, various quarters.
The use of pro forma financial data may be misleading to investors. For example, if a press release refers to last quarter's earnings, are these pro forma or GAAP? In response, the SEC now requires that if companies release pro forma financial data, they must also reconcile this data with
GAAP
Additionally, the SEC issued a cease-and-desist order proceeding against
Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, Inc., in 2002, its first enforcement action regarding pro forma statements by publicly traded companies. At issue in this case is the fact that the company discussed net income and earnings per share in the press release, but the company did not indicate whether these were prepared according to GAAP or were pro forma. And while the company discussed a one-time charge that was excluded, it was felt that investors would interpret that this one-time charge was the only difference between what was reported in the release and GAAP. In fact, there was a
- ne-time gain that was included in the release income and EPS figures, but this was not disclosed as such—giving the misleading impression that the company met analysts' forecasts.
We can see the relation between earnings information and stock prices in
Exhibit 5.3, as we follow the price of Trump stock, using a high-low-close diagram, and trading volume around the key dates pertaining to the earnings release. The company's press release, indicating that the company met analysts' expectations, resulted in an increased stock price. This stock price gain soon dissipated as more information was revealed.

There is evidence that companies with strong investor sentiment tend to be more likely to have more differences between GAAP and pro forma
 earnings Therefore, we expect to find a greater difference between the two earnings numbers during speculative run-ups of stock.
### Core Earnings

The recent experiences with financial restatements resulting from the management of earnings and outright fraud sparked many to develop earnings metrics that were not affected by the most obvious tools for earnings management. Standard and Poor's (S&P) introduced a calculation in 2001 referred to as core earnings that they use to represent a company's sustainable performance.

Core earnin s are earnin s ad usted as follows  13 g g j

|IncludedintheCalculationofCoreEarnings|ExcludedfromtheCalculationof<br>CoreEarnings|
|---|---|
|Cost of employee options<br>Purchased<br>research<br>and<br>development<br>expense<br>Pension costs<br>Restructuring<br>charges<br>from<br>continuing<br>operations<br>Unrealized gains or losses from hedging<br>core risk exposures<br>Merger and acquisition related expenses|Gains from pensions<br>Gains or losses from<br>asset sales<br>Litigation or insurance<br>settlements<br>Goodwill<br>impairment<br>charges|

In other words, it is earnings before the most manageable items and the more unusual and infrequent earnings and losses.

However, we should note that core earnings are not without the potential for management, as reported in a study by Sarah McVay. Corresponding to the popularity of core earnings as a performance metric, many companies

 began shifting expenses to special items As she notes, such shifting does

 began shifting expenses to special items As she notes, such shifting does not reverse itself as do some other earnings management techniques, hence

 providing an inflated picture of the company's performance

### Earnings per Share

We often refer to earnings in terms of the amount per share of stock, rather than as a total dollar amount generated in a period. Expressing a company's net income in terms of income per share allows us to compare it with the company's market price per share. _Earnings per share_ (EPS) is earnings available for common shareholders, divided by the number of common shares outstanding:

This ratio indicates each share's portion of how much is earned by the firm in a given accounting period:

Suppose a company has 5 million of earnings and 4 million shares

- utstanding. Its earnings per share are:
This company earned 1.25 for each common share outstanding.
The EPS does not tell us anything about the preferred shareholders. And that's acceptable because preferred shareholders, in most cases, receive a fixed dividend amount. Because the common shareholders are the residual
- wners of the firm—they are the last ones in line after creditors and preferred shareholders—we are interested in seeing just what is left over for them.
When we see an amount given for EPS, we have to be sure we know what it really means. But what is there to interpret? Net income available to common shares is pretty clear-cut (with some exceptions). What about the number of common shares outstanding? Can that change during the period
- f time under consideration? It can, affecting the calculated value of earnings per share. The number of common shares outstanding can change for two reasons:
**1.** _Timing_ . Net income is earned over a specific period of time, yet the number of shares outstanding may change over this period.
**2.** _Dilutive securities_ . The company may have securities outstanding that can be converted into common stock or employee stock options and warrants that may be exercisable (i.e., potentially dilutive securities), so the number of shares of common that can potentially be shared in this net income is greater than the number reported as
  - utstanding.
Timing requires us to consider the net income relative to some meaningful measure of common shares outstanding during the same period.
We can do this by first calculating the weighted average number of shares
- utstanding during the period.
Suppose the ABC company has income available for common shareholders of 2,000,000 and there are no potentially dilutive securities.
ABC provides you with the following information:
Number of shares outstanding January 1 200,000 shares
Number of shares issued July 1 50,000 shares
Number of shares outstanding December 31 250,000 shares
The weighted average number of shares outstanding is:
What are the earnings per share for the year?
We can represent the earnings per share adjusted for the change in the shares outstanding as:
For a company having securities that are dilutive—meaning they could share in net income—there are two earnings per share amounts that are
 reported in financial statements _Basic earnings per share_ are earnings
(minus preferred stock dividends), divided by the average number of shares
- utstanding, which is the previous standard's simple earnings per share.
_Diluted earnings per share_ are earnings (minus preferred stock dividends), divided by the number of shares outstanding considering all dilutive securities (e.g., convertible debt, options), which is the previous standard's fully diluted earnings per share. Companies that report earnings per share for any prior period must restate these amounts in terms of the new basic and diluted calculations.
To see how to calculate earnings per share, consider Adobe Systems
Incorporated's 2010 earnings per share. Net income for 2010 was 774.68 million. The average number of shares for the basic earnings per share
figure is 519.045 million. Therefore,
As of 2010, Adobe had the potential to issue 6.779 million additional
 shares that dilute earnings per share because of employee stock options
Adding the potential shares to the weighted average outstanding shares in the denominator,
Diluted earnings per share may never be reported as greater than basic
 earnings per share
## PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO

Many investors are interested in how the earnings are valued by the market.

A measure of how these earnings are valued is the _price-earnings ratio_

(P/E). This ratio compares the price per common share with earnings per common share:

The result is a multiple—the value of a share of stock expressed as a multiple of earnings per share.

The inverse of this measure is referred to as the _earnings yield_, or E/P  19

Because investors are forward-looking in their valuation, earnings in this ratio represent the expected normal earnings per share for the stock. If a company has a share price of 17 and earnings per share of 80 cents, the price-earnings ratio is and the earnings yield is

If the market value of the stock represents today's forecast of future earnings to common shareholders and if current earnings are an indication

- f future earnings, this ratio tells us that each dollar of earnings represents
21.25 of value today.
P/E ratios vary over time for the S&P 500, typically ranging from 8 to 20 times, averaging around 14.2 times, though in recent years the P/E has gone
- ut of these bounds, reaching up towards record-breaking highs toward 124
Exhibit 5.4.20 times, as we show using Robert Shiller's data in
EXHIBIT 5.4 Price-Earnings Ratio for the S&P Composite Index, 1881–
_Source of data:_ Department of Economics, Yale University,
[www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls.](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls)
An interesting issue arises in deciding the appropriate inputs to this ratio.
The numerator is rather straightforward: use a recent market price per share.
The denominator presents a number of issues. Aside from the issue of whether the denominator is the basic or diluted earnings per share, an important issue is over what period to measure earnings per share. At any point in time, the most recently ending annual period or quarter's earnings may not usually be available. Further muddying the waters is whether the
P/E ratio should be measured over an historical period (backward-looking)
- r measured using forecasted earnings (forward-looking). So what is the analyst to do? There are several approaches that are used:
The sum of the latest available four reported quarters.
Estimated earnings for the next fiscal year.
Earnings per share averaged over several historical, annual periods.
The latter method is suggested by Graham and Dodd and uses an EPS that is the average of EPS for “not less than five years, preferably seven or 10 years.  21
Using a backward-looking P/E can be misleading because of what is known as the “Molodovsky effect.  22 If the current price is used in the numerator and the most recent four quarters of earnings are in the denominator, the P/E is exaggerated during periods of economic stress if the price reflects future earnings, as we would reason, and the earnings reflect a poor performance during the economic stress. This is evident in 2009, as prices were forward-looking and earnings were backward-looking.
Taking a closer look at the determinant of P/E ratios, we see that this ratio

As pointed out by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French in their study of the relation between stock returns and fundamental factors, E/P (or its inverse

P/E) includes the stock price in its construction and hence should be correlated with stock returns  23 correlated with stock returns  23

This has been supported in research that

 finds that E/P explains stock returns

## DIVIDENDS

_Dividends_ are cash payments made by a corporation to its owners. Though cash dividends are paid to both preferred and common shareholders, most

- f the focus of the attention is on the dividends paid to the residual owners
- f the corporation, the common shareholders. Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders are not legal obligations of a corporation and some corporations do not pay cash dividends.
Dividends are measured using three different measures:
Dividends per share DPS.
Dividend yield.
Dividend payout.
For those companies that pay dividends, changes in dividends are noticed by investors: Increases in dividends are viewed favorably and are associated with increases in the company's stock price, whereas decreases in dividends are viewed quite unfavorably and are associated with decreases in the company's stock price.
Researchers have found a strong relation between changes in dividends
 and share prices, and also between dividend yields and stock prices
Researchers have also found a strong relation in the aggregate between dividend payouts and earnings growth: the higher the payout—and hence the positive signal provided by the company's management—the greater the
 future earning growth
We look at these three measures of dividends: DPS, dividend yield, and dividend payout. Following our discussion of the different measures, we take a look at how dividends and stock prices are related, including a discussion of the dividend valuation model that provides the theoretical link between future dividends and current stock prices.
### Dividends per Share

The value of a share of stock today is the investors' assessment of today's worth of future cash flows for each share. Because future cash flows to shareholders are dividends, we need a measure of dividends for each share

- f stock to estimate future cash flows per share. The _dividends per share_
(DPS) is the dollar amount of dividends paid out during the period per share
- f common stock:
If a company has paid 600,000 in dividends during the period and has
1.5 million shares outstanding,
The company paid out 40 cents in dividends per common share during this period.
There is no requirement that companies pay cash dividends. We observe, however, that many companies do pay cash dividends and, once they pay dividends only reluctantly (in cases of financial distress) lower or eliminate cash dividends. It is often the case, however, that companies that are relatively young, fast-growing companies do not pay dividends; as the companies mature they begin to pay dividends. Companies in high-growth industries tend to pay little or no dividends.
### Dividend Yield

Another measure is the _dividend yield_, which is the ratio of dividends to price:

Historically, the dividend yield for U.S. stocks was 4.73\%, but more recently the average dividend yield has dropped to around 1.6\%, as you can see in Exhibit 5.5.27

EXHIBIT 5.5 Dividend Yields

_Source of data:_ Yale University, Department of Economics,

[www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls.](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls)

In an exhaustive study of the relation between dividend yield and stock price, John Campbell and Robert Shiller find that:

There is a weak relation between the dividend yield and subsequent 10year dividend growth.

The dividend yield does not forecast future dividend growth.

The dividend yield predicts future price changes.

The weak relation between the current dividend yield and future dividends may be attributed to the effects of the business cycle on dividend growth. The tendency for the dividend yield to revert to its historical mean

 has been observed by researchers

### Dividend Payout

Another way of describing dividends paid out during a period is to state the dividends as a portion of earnings for the period. This is referred to as the

:

_dividend payout ratio_

The complement of this ratio is the _plowback ratio_, which is the ratio of retained earnings to earnings:

If a company pays \$360,000 in dividends and has earnings available to common shareholders of \$1.2 million, the payout ratio is 30\% and the plow-back ratio is 70\%:

This means that the company paid out 30\% of its earnings to shareholders.

The proportion of earnings paid out in dividends varies by company and industry. For example, the companies in the railroad industry typically pay

- ut 20\% of their earnings in dividends, whereas utility companies typically pay out approximately 60\% of their earnings in dividends.
If companies focus on dividends per share in establishing their dividends
(e.g., a constant dividends per share), the dividend payout will fluctuate along with earnings. We generally observe that a company sets its dividend policy such that dividends per share grow at a relatively constant rate, resulting in dividend payouts that fluctuate. Consider the example of Abbott
Laboratories, illustrated in Exhibit 5.6. Abbott Laboratories' dividends per share have been increasing at a relatively constant rate, as indicated by an upward-sloping curve, yet its dividend payout fluctuates within the range of
40\% to 60\% in the more recent years.
EXHIBIT 5.6 Abbott Laboratories' Dividends per Share and Dividend
Payout, 1982–2010
_Source of data:_ Dividend and earnings data are from Abbott Laboratories 10-K filings, various years.
### Dividends and Stock Prices

If an investor buys a common stock, they have bought shares that represent an ownership interest in the corporation. Shares of common stock are a perpetual security—there is no maturity. The investor who owns shares of common stock has the right to receive a certain portion of any dividends— but dividends are _not_ a sure thing. Whether a firm will pay dividends is up to its board of directors—the representatives of the common shareholders.

Typically we see some pattern in the dividends companies pay: Dividends are either constant or grow at a constant rate. But there is no guarantee that dividends will be paid in the future.

Preferred shareholders are in a similar situation as the common shareholders. They expect to receive cash dividends in the future, but the payment of these dividends is up to the board of directors. But there are three major differences between the dividends of preferred and common shares. First, the dividends on preferred stock usually are specified at a fixed rate or dollar amount, whereas the amount of dividends is not specified for common shares. Second, preferred shareholders are given preference: Their dividends must be paid before any dividends are paid on common stock. Third, if the preferred stock has a _cumulative feature_, dividends not paid in one period accumulate and are carried over to the next period. Therefore, the dividends on preferred stock are more certain than those on common shares.

It is reasonable to figure that what an investor pays for a share of stock should reflect what he or she expects to receive from it—return on his or her investment. What you receive are cash dividends in the future. How can we relate that return to what a share of common stock is worth? Well, the value of a share of stock should be equal to the present value of all the

 29 future cash flows you expect to receive from that share

Because common stock never matures, today's value is the present value

- f an infinite stream of cash flows. And also, common stock dividends are not fixed, as in the case of preferred stock. Not knowing the amount of the dividends—or even if there will be future dividends—makes it difficult to determine the value of common stock.
So what are we to do? Well, we can grapple with the valuation of common stock by looking at its current dividend and making assumptions about any future dividends it may pay.
### The Dividend Valuation Model

If dividends are constant forever, the value of a share of stock is the present value of the dividends per share per period, in perpetuity. Let _D_ represent the constant dividend per share of common stock expected next period and each period thereafter, forever, _P_ 0 represent the price of a share of stock

_r_ today, and _e_ the required rate of return on common stock. The _required rate_

_of return_ is the return shareholders demand to compensate them for the time value of money tied up in their investments and the uncertainty of the future cash flows from these investments.

The current price of a share of common stock, _P_ 0, is which we can write using summation notation,

The summation of a constant amount discounted from perpetuity simplifies to

If the current dividend is 2 per share and the required rate of return is

10\%, the value of a share of stock is

Therefore, if you pay \$20 per share and dividends remain constant at \$2 per share, you will earn a 10\% return per year on your investment every year.

But dividends on common stock often change through time.

If dividends grow at a constant rate, the value of a share of stock is the present value of a _growing_ cash flow  0 Let _D_ 30 indicate _this_ period's dividend. If dividends grow at a constant rate, _g_, forever, the present value

- f the common stock is the present value of all _future_ dividends:
Pulling today's dividend _D_ 0, from each term,
Using summation notation,
Because  31 is approximately equal to
If we represent the next period's dividend, _D_ 1, in terms of this period's dividend, _D_ 0, compounded one period at the rate _g_,
- r and substitute for _D_ :
0 then
This equation is referred to as the _dividend valuation model_ (DVM).
Consider a firm expected to pay a constant dividend of $2 per share, forever. If this dividend is capitalized at 10\%, the value of a share is $20:
If, on the other hand, the dividends are expected to be $2 in the _next_ period and grow at a rate of 6\% per year, forever, the value of a share of stock is $50:
Does this make sense? Yes: If dividends are expected to grow in the future, the stock is worth more than if the dividends are expected to remain the same.
If today's value of a share is 50, what are we saying about the value of the stock next year? If we move everything up one period, _D_ 1 is no longer
\$2, but \$2 grown one period at 6\%, or 2.12. Therefore, we expect the price
- f the stock at the end of one year, _P_ 1, to be 53:
At the end of two years, the price will be even larger:
Because we expect dividends to grow each period, we also are expecting the price of the stock to grow through time as well. In fact, the price is expected to grow at the same rate as the dividends: 6\% per period.
What if the dividends are expected to decline each year? That is, what if _g_ is negative? We can still use the dividend valuation model, but each dividend in the future is expected to be _less_ than the one before it. For example, suppose a stock has a current dividend of $5 per share and the required rate of return is 10\%. If dividends are expected to decline 3\% each year, what is the value of a share of stock today? We know that _D_ 0 = $5, _re_ =
10\%, and _g_ = –3\%. Therefore,
Next period's dividend, _D_ 1, is expected to be 4.85. We capitalize this at
13\%: 10\% − (−3 \%) or 10\% +3\%. What do we expect the price of the stock to be next period?
The expected price goes the same way as the dividend: down 3\% each year.
We illustrate the relation between the growth rate of dividends, _g_, and the
Exhibit 5.7.
price of the stock expected in the future in For a given required rate of return and dividend—in this case _re_ = 10\% and _D_ 1 = 2—we see that
.
the price of a share of stock is expected to grow each period at the rate _g_
EXHIBIT 5.7 Price of a Share of Stock in the Future for Different Rates of
Growth in Future Dividends
Let's look at another situation, one in which growth is expected to _change_ but at different growth rates as time goes on. Consider a share of common stock whose dividend is currently 3 per share and is expected to grow at a rate of 8\% per year for five years and afterward at a rate of 2\% per year after five years. To tackle this problem, let's break it into two manageable parts: the first five years and after five years, or
The present value of the dividends in the first five years is:
The present value of dividends received after the fifth year—evaluated
_P_ : five years from today—is the expected price of the stock in five years, 5
The price expected at the end of five years is 56.23, which we translate into a value today by discounting it five periods at 10\%:
Putting the pieces together,
The value of a share of this stock is 49.08. We can see the growth in the expected price of a share of stock in Exhibit 5.8, where the dividends grows at a rate of 8\% the first five years and 2\% after the fifth year.
EXHIBIT 5.8 Price and Dividends per Share for the Case of 8\% Growth in
Dividends for the First Five Years, 2\% Thereafter
The dividend valuation model makes some sense regarding the relation between the value of a share of stock, the growth in dividends, and the discount rate:
The greater the current dividend, the greater the value of a share of stock.
The greater the expected growth in dividends, the greater the value of a share of stock.
The more uncertainty regarding future dividends, the greater the discount rate and the lower the value of a share of stock.
However, the DVM has some drawbacks. How do you deal with dividends that do not grow at a constant rate? As you can see in our example, this model does not accommodate nonconstant growth easily.
What if the firm does not currently pay dividends? In that case, _D_ 0 would be zero and the expected price would be zero—but a zero price for a share of stock does not make any sense! Therefore, the DVM may be appropriate to use to value the stock of companies with stable dividend policies, but it is not applicable for all companies.
### The DVM and PE

We can represent the dividend valuation model in terms of a share's P/E ratio. Let's start with the dividend valuation model with constant growth in dividends:

If we divide both sides of this equation by earnings per share, we can represent the dividend valuation model in terms of the P/E ratio, with subscripts denoting time periods:

- r
This tells us the P/E ratio is influenced by the dividend payout ratio, the required rate of return on equity, and the expected growth rate of dividends.
## OTHER FUNDAMENTALS

Aside from the earnings for a given period, we may also be interested in knowing the common equity for each share. One measure of this investment is the book value of equity per share, also referred to as the _book value per_

_share_ :

For Yahoo! for 2010,

In accounting terms, each common share has a shareholders' equity of

9.565.

The book value of equity may differ from the market value. The market value per share, if available, is a much better indicator of the investment of shareholders in the firm. The market value of a share of Yahoo! common stock was \$16.75 at the end of 2010, which is substantially greater than the book value of \$9.565 per share. This large difference between market and book values of equity is not unique to Yahoo!.

And the book value of equity could actually be negative. Consider Rite

Aid, a retail drug store chain. Rite Aid had negative shareholders' equity of

\$2 billion at the end of the 2010 fiscal year, but a per share price of \$1.31.

As another example, Ford Motor Company had a negative equity of \$673 million at the end of 2010 (which translates into a book value of −\$0.18 per

33 share), but its share price at the end of 2010 was 16.79  Book value of equity (i.e., total shareholders' deficit) is negative, in large part, because of the accumulated deficit. But does the negative value of equity mean that the common stock is worthless? No.

## BOOK-TO-MARKET RATIO

Many researchers observe that the ratio of the book value of equity to the market value of equity, BV/MV, is related to security returns: higher

34,35

BV/MVs are associated with higher future returns  The ratio is therefore

In the case of the Coca-Cola Company, at the end of 2010 the BV/MV ratio was

The relation between the book and market values of equity are sometimes reported as the inverse of the BV/MV,

This tells us that for every 1 of book value of Coca-Cola, the market values it more than six times. We can see in Exhibit 5.9 for Coca-Cola that the variation in BV/MV or MV/BV ratios is due primarily to the changing market value of equity.

EXHIBIT 5.9 Book Value and Market Value per Share for Coca-Cola,

1980–2010

_Source:_ Yahoo! Finance and Coca-Cola, annual reports and 10-K filings.

In studies of the relation between stock returns and fundamentals, Fama and French find that BV/MV and firm size (i.e., equity capitalization)

 explain cross-sectional security returns Further, they find that BV/MV explains security returns better than both beta and size, where high BV/MV companies have higher returns.

Just why the book-to-market equity ratio explains security returns is not known since there is little theoretical justification for this ratio to influence returns. There are several explanations for the role of BV/MV in affecting returns. One explanation is that BV/MV is a proxy for risk: the greater the firm's BV/MV, the greater the risk of that firm's security. This explanation is consistent with efficient market theory and Fama and French's evidence if

BV/MV is considered a risk factor and is therefore priced accordingly.

Another explanation for the book-to-market's relation to security returns is that it proxies for future growth: the greater the BV/MV (or, equivalently, the lower the MV/BV), the lower the firm's expected future growth

37,38 prospects. This explanation is supported by other research  Given this latter explanation, the ratio is a measure of the value-added by the firm's management: The lower the BV/MV ratio and, hence, the higher the value

- f the MV/BV ratio, the better the firm is managing its assets to generate future value for the firm, which is reflected in the current price.
**EXHIBIT 5.10** Sorting Out the Book and Market Relationship
It has been argued that BV/MV represents, in part, the growth options that
 a company has: the greater the growth options, the lower the BV/MV
Related to this explanation is the hypothesis offered by Robert Haugen: The market consistently overestimates the persistence of above average future growth, which may explain why low BV/MV companies at times
 underperform high BV/MV companies Or, in other words, high BV/MV companies are undervalued.
## SUMMARY

Earnings are used in the valuation of stock because of the close relation that has been observed between earnings and stock prices. There are many definitions of earnings, with the appropriate definition being dependent on the particular use of earnings in the analysis.

One measure of earnings is net income, but the experience of the recent past in terms of financial reporting has taught us to be cautious of interpreting this measure. Core earnings, which adjusts for the most likely managed items in earnings, is an attempt to produce an earnings measure that is not as manageable as net income. A related measure of earnings is earnings per share (EPS). Complications arise in its calculation not only because of the definition of earnings, but in the determination of the number

- f shares of stock outstanding.
The relation between earnings and stock prices is often summarized using the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), or its inverse, the earnings yield (E/P).
Calculation of the P/E or E/P is complicated by the issue of what earnings per share amount to use—historical, current, or expected.
The cash flows that are valued in a share's price are the company's future dividends. We measure dividends in a number of ways, including dividends per share, the dividend yield, and the dividend payout ratio. Dividends and stock prices are related in theory. The dividend valuation model expresses the current stock price as a function of future dividends. This model can be applied to cases of constant dividends, dividends growing at a constant rate, and dividends growing at rates that change over time.
Other fundamental measures of a company's performance include the book value per share and the book-to-market ratio. The book-to-market ratio (BV/MV) relates the accounting value of equity to the market's value
- f equity.

Based on Unexpected Earnings and the Importance of Risk Adjustment,”

16. Beginning with fiscal years ending after December 15, 1997, companies must report both basic and diluted earnings per share (see
FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, “Earnings per Share,” 1997). This replaces the previous requirement of simple, primary, and fully diluted EPS primary earnings per share, as the earnings per share calculation that reflects the dilutive effects of securities considered is likely to be transformed into common stock, such as convertible securities, options, and warrants. Fully diluted earnings per share are earnings per share that reflect the dilutive effects of all potentially dilutive securities (for example, including options that are
“out-of-the-money”).
17. The source for this data is Adobe Systems Incorporated, 2010 10-K filing, Note 15.
18. There are instances in which certain dilutive securities may be
_antidilutive_ ; that is, the effect of the additional shares outstanding is
- utweighed by the adjusted to earnings in the numerator. This may occur in instances such as a convertible bond, where the effect of adding back the interest does not outweigh the dampening effect of the additional shares.
19. Though the earnings yield provides the same information as the priceearnings ratio, it is often used to avoid the problem of dividing by zero in the cases in which earnings are zero.

This does not mean that higher MV/BV companies will outperform lower MV/BV companies in the future.
Evidence seems to indicate that high MV/BV companies (“growth” companies) will underperform low MV/BV companies (“value” companies) in the future.

# CHAPTER 6 Cash Flow Analysis

An objective of financial analysis is to assess a company's operating performance and financial condition. The information that an analyst has available includes economic, market, and financial information. But some

- f the most important financial data are provided by the company in its annual and quarterly financial statements. However, the choices available in the accrual accounting system make it difficult to compare companies' performance. These choices also provide the opportunity for the management of financial numbers through judicious choice of accounting methods. For example, \$1 of net income for one company may not be equivalent to \$1 of net income of another company.
Cash flows provide the analyst with a way of transforming net income based on an accrual system to a more comparable medium. Additionally, cash flows are essential ingredients in valuation: The value of a company today is the present value of its expected future cash flows. Therefore, understanding past and current cash flows may help the analyst in forecasting future cash flows and determining the value of the company.
## MEASURES OF CASH FLOW

The primary difficulty with measuring a cash flow is that it is a flow: Cash flows into the company (cash inflows) and cash flows out of the company

(cash outflows). At any point in time there is a stock of cash on hand, but the stock of cash on hand varies among companies because of the size of the company, the cash demands of the business, and a company's management of working capital.

So what is cash flow? Is it the total amount of cash flowing into the company during a period? Is it the total amount of cash flowing out of the company during a period? Is it the net of the cash inflows and outflows for a period? Well, there is no specific definition of cash flow—and that's probably why there is so much confusion regarding the measurement of cash flow. Ideally, the analyst needs a measure of the company's operating performance that is comparable among companies—something other than net income (e.g., net cash flow).

A simple, yet crude method of calculating cash flow requires adding noncash expenses (e.g., depreciation and amortization) to the reported net income amount to arrive at an approximation of cash flow, _earnings before_

_depreciation and amortization_, or EBDA  For example, the EBDA for J. C.

Penney Company, Inc., for 2010, was

This amount is not really a cash flow, but simply earnings before depreciation and amortization. Is this estimate of value in analysis? Though not a cash flow, EBDA does allow a quick comparison of income across

 firms that may use different depreciation methods and depreciable lives

The problem with this measure is that it ignores the many other sources and uses of cash during the period. Consider the sale of goods for credit.

This transaction generates sales for the period. Sales and the accompanying cost of goods sold are reflected in the period's net income and the estimated cash flow amount. However, until the account receivable is collected there is no cash from this transaction. If collection does not occur until the next period, there is a misalignment of the income and cash flow arising from this transaction. Additionally, there are noncash items that affect net income, but which are not cash inflows or outflows. For example, in 2010,

J. C. Penney had stock-based compensation of 23 million in 2010, which was deducted to arrive at net income, but which was not a cash outflow for the period. Therefore, the simple estimated cash flow ignores some cash flows that, for many companies, are significant.

Another estimate of cash flow that is simple to calculate is EBITDA—

_earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization_ . We calculate

EBITDA by starting with operating income (that is, earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT), and add back any interest expense. For J. C. Penney,

EBITDA in 2010, in millions, was:

Income from continuing operations before income taxes 378

Add: interest expense 231

Add: depreciation and amortization 511

EBITDA 1,120

EBITDA is useful not only for its simplicity, but because it allows us to compare companies based on operations, without considering how companies choose to finance their assets. In analyzing companies in industries that require heavy capital investments, such as telecommunications, EBITDA may give a better measure of performance than, say, net income because the large depreciation expenses do not affect

EBITDA.

However, this measure suffers from the accrual-accounting bias in

EBITDA, which may result in the omission of significant cash flows.

Additionally, EBITDA is before interest and taxes, which may be

3,4

 substantial cash outflows for some companies

These two rough estimates of cash flows—EBDA and EBITDA—are used in practice not only for their simplicity, but because they experienced widespread use prior to the disclosure of more detailed information in the statement of cash flows. Currently, the measures of cash flow are wideranging, including these simplistic cash flows measures, measures developed from the statement of cash flows, and measures that seek to capture the theoretical concept of “free cash flow.”

## CASH FLOWS AND THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

Prior to the adoption of the statement of cash flows, the information regarding cash flows was quite limited. The first statement from the

Accounting Principles Board (APB) that addressed the issue of cash flows was the Statement of Financial Position, which was required beginning in

1971.5 This statement was quite limited, requiring an analysis of the sources and uses of funds in a variety of formats. In its earlier years of adoption, most companies provided this information using what is referred to as the working capital concept—a presentation of working capital provided and applied during the period. Over time, many companies began presenting this information using the cash concept, which is a most detailed presentation of the cash flows provided by operations, investing, and

 financing activities

Consistent with the cash concept format of the funds flow statement, the

7 statement of cash flows became a required statement starting in 1987  This statement requires the company to classify cash flows into three categories, based on the activity: operating, investing, and financing. Cash flows are summarized by activity and within activity by type (e.g., asset dispositions are reported separately from asset acquisitions).

The reporting company may report the cash flows from operating activities on the statement cash flows using either the _direct method_ reporting all cash inflows and outflows—or the _indirect method_ - starting with net income and making adjustments for depreciation and other noncash expenses and for changes in working capital accounts. The direct method provides more information about the sources of a company's cash flows. Though the direct method is recommended, it is also the most

8 burdensome for the reporting company to prepare  As a result, most

8 burdensome for the reporting company to prepare  As a result, most

 companies report cash flows from operations using the indirect method

The indirect method produces a cash flow from operations that is similar to the estimated cash flow measure discussed previously, yet it encompasses the changes in working capital accounts that the simple measure does not.

For example, J. C. Penney's cash flow from operating activities (taken from their 2010 statement of cash flows) is 592 million, which differs substantially from the cash flows we estimated earlier.

The classification of cash flows into the three types of activities provides useful information that can be used by the analyst to see, for example, whether the company is generating sufficient cash flows from operations to sustain its current rate of growth. However, the classification of particular items is not necessarily as useful as it could be. Consider some of the classifications  10

Cash flows related to interest expense are classified in operations, though they are clearly financing cash flows.

Income taxes are classified as operating cash flows, though taxes are affected by financing (e.g., deduction for interest expense paid on debt)

9 and investment activities (e.g., the reduction of taxes from tax credits

   on investment activities).
Interest income and dividends received are classified as operating cash flows, though these flows are a result of investment activities.
Whether these items have a significant effect on the analysis depends on the particular company's situation. J. C. Penney, for example, has very little interest and dividend income in 2010, and its interest expense of \$231 million is about one-fifth its EBITDA of \$1,120 million. Adjusting J. C.
Penney's cash flows for the interest expense only (and related taxes) changes the complexion of its cash flows slightly to reflect greater cash flow generation from operations and less cash flow reliance on financing

|activities: 11|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||As Reported (in millions)|As Adjusted (in millions)|
|Cash flow from operations|\$592|\$742|
|Cash flow from (for) investing activities|(485)|(485)|
|Cash flow from (for) financing activities|(496)|(646)|
|_Source of data:_ J. C. Penney 2010 annual report.|_Source of data:_ J. C. Penney 2010 annual report.|_Source of data:_ J. C. Penney 2010 annual report.|

For other companies, however, this adjustment may provide a different perspective on a company's cash flows. Consider General Motor's 2010

|cash flows: 12|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||As reported (in millions)|As adjusted (in millions)|
|Cash flow from operations|\$6,172|\$7,138|
|Cash flow from (for) investing activities|1,233|1,233|
|Cash flow from (for) financing activities|(9,770)|(10,736)|
|_Source of data:_ General Motors, 2010 annual report.|_Source of data:_ General Motors, 2010 annual report.|_Source of data:_ General Motors, 2010 annual report.|

The reclassification of interest income and interest expense offers a slightly different picture of the cash outflows related to General Motor's investing and financing: a greater reliance on financing.

Looking at the relation among the three cash flows in the statement gives the analyst a sense of the activities of the company. A young, fast growing company may have negative cash flows from operations, yet positive cash flows from financing activities (i.e., operations may be financed to a large part with external financing). As a company grows, it may rely to a lesser extent on external financing.

The typical, mature company generates cash from operations and reinvests part or all of it back into the company. Therefore, cash flow related to operations in a healthy company is positive (i.e., a source of cash) and cash flow related to investing activities is negative (i.e., a use of cash).

As a company matures, it may seek less financing externally and may even use cash to reduce its reliance on external financing (e.g., repay debts). We can classify companies on the basis of the pattern of their sources of cash flows, as shown in Exhibit 6.1. Though additional information is required to assess a company's financial performance and condition, examination of the company's operations.

sources of cash flows, especially over time, gives us a general idea of the

EXHIBIT 6.1 Patterns of Sources of Cash Flows

Though we can classify a company based on the sources and uses of cash flows, more data are needed to put this information in perspective. What is the trend in the sources and uses of cash flows? What market, industry, or company-specific events affect the company's cash flows? How does the company being analyzed compare with other companies in the same industry in terms of the sources and uses of funds?

Let's take a closer look at the incremental information provided by cash flows. Consider Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which had growing sales and net income over the years, as summarized in Exhibit 6.2. We see that net income grew each year, with the exception of 1995, and that sales grew each year.

EXHIBIT 6.2 Wal-Mart Stores Net Income and Revenues for the Years

1988–2010

_Source of data:_ Wal-Mart, 10-K filings, various years.

We get additional information about Wal-Mart by looking at the cash flow and their sources, as we show in Exhibit 6.3. We see that the growth in WalMart was supported by both internally generated funds and, to a lesser extent, through external financing. After 2000, Wal-Mart has depended on

- perating cash flows and has paid down its debt. Wal-Mart's pattern of cash flows suggests that Wal-Mart is a mature company that has become less reliant on external financing in recent years, funding most of its growth with internally generated funds.
EXHIBIT 6.3 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Sources of Cash Flow, 1988–2010
_Source of data:_ Wal-Mart, annual reports, various years.
We can see the typical pattern of a fast-growing company in the reported
[cash flow of Amazon.com, Inc. as shown in](http://amazon.com/) Exhibit 6.4. Here we see the company's cash flows from its origin in 1994, through its high growth– heavy investment phase in 1994–2010, and into the period during which it sustained itself primarily through cash flows from operations.
EXHIBIT 6.4 Amazon.com, Inc., Cash Flows, 1995–2010
_Source of data:_ Amazon.com, 10-K filings, various years.
## FREE CASH FLOW

Cash flows without any adjustment may be misleading because they do not reflect the cash outflows that are necessary for the future existence of a firm. An alternative measure, _free cash flow_, was developed by Michael



Jensen in his theoretical analysis of agency costs and corporate takeovers

In theory, free cash flow (FCF) is the cash flow left over after the company funds all positive net present value projects. Positive net present value projects are those projects (i.e., capital investments) for which the present value of expected future cash flows exceeds the present value of project



- utlays, all discounted at the cost of capital Broadly stated, free cash flow is the cash flow of the firm, less capital expenditures necessary to stay in business (i.e., replacing facilities as necessary) and grow at the expected rate (which requires increases in working capital).
The perspective that we have taken in this definition of free cash flow is that of the shareholders: What is left for shareholders after the company makes necessary capital expenditures. That is why this definition of free cash flow is stated as _free cash flow to equity_, or FCFE. From the shareholders' perspective, any net borrowings that a company makes are
 available for shareholders, so net borrowings are often added to FCFE
We could take a broader perspective and consider the _free cash flow to the_
_firm_ (FCFF), which is FCFE with after-tax interest and net borrowings added  16
FCFF therefore provides a measure of how much cash flow is available to all suppliers of capital—lenders and creditors. We summarize the calculation of FCFE and FCFF in Exhibit 6.5.
**EXHIBIT 6.5** Calculation of Free Cash Flow

For J. C. Penne the 2010 free cash flow for the firm is: y,

|Free cash flow to equity (FCFE)|93|
|Add: After-tax interest [231 (1 – 0.35)]|150|
|Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)|243|

The theory of free cash flow was developed by Jensen to explain behaviors of companies that could not be explained by existing economic theories. Jensen posited that companies that generate free cash flow should disgorge that cash rather than invest the funds in less profitable investment, wasting funds. There are many ways in which companies may disgorge this excess cash flow, including the payment of cash dividends, the repurchase

- f stock, and debt issuance in exchange for stock. The debt-for stock exchange, for example, increases the company's leverage and future debt
- bligations, obligating the future use of excess cash flow. If a company does not disgorge this free cash flow, there is the possibility that another company—a company whose cash flows are less than its profitable investment opportunities or a company that is willing to purchase and leverup the company—will attempt to acquire the free-cash-flow-laden company.
As a case in point, Jensen observed that the oil industry illustrates the case of wasting resources: The free cash flows generated in the 1980s were spent on low-return exploration and development and on poor diversification attempts through acquisitions. He argues that these companies would have been better off paying these excess cash flows to shareholders through share repurchases or exchanges with debt.
By itself, the fact that a company generates free cash flow is neither good nor bad. What the company _does_ with this free cash flow is what is important. And this is where it is important to measure the free cash flow as that cash flow in excess of profitable investment opportunities. Consider the simple numerical exercise with the Winner Company and the Loser

|Company:|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||Winner Company|Loser Company|
|Cash flow before capital expenditures|\$1,000|\$1,000|
|Capital expenditures, positive net present value projects|750|250|
|Capital expenditures, negative net present value projects|0|500|
|Cash flow|\$250|\$250|
|Free cash flow|\$250|\$750|

These two companies have identical cash flows and the same total capital expenditures. However, the Winner Company spends only on profitable projects (in terms of positive net present value projects), whereas the Loser

Company spends on both profitable projects and wasteful projects. The

Winner Company has a lower free cash flow than the Loser Company, indicating that they are using the generated cash flows in a more profitable manner. The lesson is that the existence of a high level of free cash flow is not necessarily good—it may simply suggest that the company is either a very good takeover target or the company has the potential for investing in unprofitable investments.

Positive free cash flow may be good news or bad news; likewise, negative free cash flow ma be - od or bad news: y g

|Col1|GoodNews|BadNews|
|---|---|---|
|Positive<br>free cash<br>flow|The company is generating substantial<br>operating cash flows, beyond those<br>necessary for profitable projects.|The company is generating more cash flows<br>than it needs for profitable projects and may<br>waste these cash flows on unprofitable<br>projects.|

Therefore, once the analyst calculates free cash flow other information

(e.g., trends in profitability) must be considered to evaluate the operating performance and financial condition of the firm.

### Calculating Free Cash Flow

There is some confusion when this theoretical concept is applied to actual companies. The primary difficulty is that the amount of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the business at its current rate of growth is generally not known; companies do not report this item and may not even be able to determine how much of a period's capital expenditures are attributed to maintenance and how much is attributed to expansion.

Some estimate free cash flow by assuming that all capital expenditures are necessary for the maintenance of the current growth of the company.

Though there is little justification in using all expenditures, this is a practical solution to an impractical calculation. This assumption allows us to estimate free cash flows using published financial statements.

There is no one correct method of calculating free cash flow and different analysts may arrive at different estimates of free cash flow for a company.

The problem is that because it is impossible to measure free cash flow as dictated by the theory, many methods have arisen to calculate this cash flow.

Consider again the example of J. C. Penney. This company provides a free cash flow from continuing operations in its Executive Report in the 10

K filing for 2010. The free cash flow that J. C. Penney provides is analogous to CFCE, but differs slightly from the above: the deduction of dividends, the inclusion of the proceeds from the sale of assets, and

 exclusion of discretionary payments to the company's pension plan By doing so, the company reports free cash flow of 158 million, which differs from our calculation:

|Col1|CashFlowfromOperations|592|
|---|---|---|
|Plus|Discretionary pension contribution|392|
|Less|Tax benefit from pension contribution|152|
|Less|Capital expenditures|499|
|Less|Dividends|189|
|Plus|Add proceeds from the sale of assets|14|
|Equals|Free cash flow from continuing operations|158|

This calculation presumes that:

**1.** The measure of capital expenditures to meet replacement and growth

- pportunities is the net of capital expenditures and proceeds from the sale of assets.
**2.** Dividends are not a discretionary expenditure.
This is an example of some of the variations that you will see in the free cash flow calculations. Because there is no one, right way to calculate free cash flow, for a given company you may see different values.
Using the simple definition of free cash flow and applying it to WinnDixie Stores, a grocery retailer, we see in Exhibit 6.6 that in the year prior to its 2005 bankruptcy filing, Winn-Dixie did not have free cash flow and that Winn-Dixie's ability to generate cash flows in excess of its capital expenditures was sporadic during the 15 years leading up to bankruptcy.
Emerging from bankruptcy in 2006, Winn-Dixie has been able to generate cash flows from operations and generate net income, albeit on a smaller scale, but it is still unable to generate free cash flows, with free cash flow of
- 17 million in its fiscal year ending June 30, 2010.

### Net Free Cash Flow

There are many variations in the calculation of cash flows that are used in analyses of companies' financial conditions and operating performances. As an example of these variations, consider the alternative to free cash flow

18 developed by Fitch Investors Service  This cash flow measure, referred to as

_net free cash flow_ (NFCF), is free cash flow less interest and other financing costs, and taxes. In this approach, free cash flow is defined as earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes, less capital expenditures.

Capital expenditures encompass all capital spending, whether for maintenance or expansion, and no changes in working capital are considered.

The basic difference between NFCF and free cash flow above is that the financing expenses—interest and, in some cases dividends—are deducted.

If preferred dividends are perceived as nondiscretionary—that is, investors come to expect the dividends—dividends can be included with the interest commitment to arrive at net free cash flow. Otherwise, dividends are deducted _from_ net free cash flow to produce cash flow. Another difference is that NFCF does not consider changes in working capital in the analysis.

Further, cash taxes are deducted to arrive at net free cash flow. Cash taxes are the income tax expense restated to reflect the actual cash flow related to this obligation, rather than the accrued expense for the period. Cash taxes are the income tax expense (from the income statement) adjusted for the

19 change in deferred income taxes (from the balance sheets)  Hence, we calculate net cash flow as:

|Col1|IncomeTaxExpense|
|---|---|
|Less|Increase in deferred income tax|
|Equals|Cash taxes|
||EBIT|
|Plus|Depreciation and amortization|
|Equals|Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization|
|Less|Capital expenditures|
|Equals|Free cash flow|
|Less|Interest|
|Less|Cash taxes|
|Equals|Net free cash flow|
|Less|Cash common dividends|
|Equals|Net cash flow|

Net cash flow gives the analyst an idea of the unconstrained cash flow of the company. This cash flow measure may be useful from a creditor's perspective in terms of evaluating the company's ability to fund additional debt. From a shareholder's perspective, net cash flow (i.e., net free cash flow net of dividends) may be an appropriate measure because this represents the cash flow that is reinvested in the company.

## THE USEFULNESS OF CASH FLOWS IN FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

The usefulness of cash flows for financial analysis depends on whether cash flows provide unique information or provides information in a manner that is more accessible or convenient for the analyst. The cash flow information provided in the statement of cash flows, for example, is not necessarily unique because most, if not all, of the information is available through analysis of the balance sheet and income statement. What the statement does provide is a classification scheme that presents information in a manner that is easier to use and, perhaps, more illustrative of the company's financial position.

An analysis of cash flows and the sources of cash flows can reveal information to the analyst, including:

_The sources of financing the company's capital spending._ Does the company generate internally (i.e., from operations) a portion or all of the funds needed for its investment activities? If a company cannot generate cash flow from operations, this may indicate problems up ahead. Reliance on external financing (e.g., equity or debt issuance) may indicate a company's inability to sustain itself over time.

_The company's dependence on borrowing._ Does the company rely heavily on borrowing that may result in difficulty in satisfying future debt service?

_The quality of earnings._ Large and growing differences between income and cash flows suggest a low quality of earnings.

### Ratio Analysis

One use of cash flow information is in ratios analysis, which was the subject of Chapter 4. In that chapter we used a cash flow-based ratio, the cash flow interest coverage ratio, as a measure of financial risk. There are a number of other cash flow-based ratios that the analyst may find useful in evaluating the operating performance and financial condition of a company.

A useful ratio to help further assess a company's cash flow is the _cash_

_flow to capital expenditures ratio_, or _capital expenditures coverage ratio_  20

This ratio gives the analyst information about the financial flexibility of the company and is particularly useful for capital-intensive firms and utilities  21 utilities  21

The larger the ratio, the greater the company's financial flexibility.

Consider the cash flow to capital expenditures ratio over the period 19882010 for International Business Machines (IBM), as we show in Exhibit

6.7.22

6.7.22

Using this ratio, we see that IBM's financial flexibility generally has improved since 1997.

EXHIBIT 6.7 IBM Cash Flow to Capital Expenditures Ratio, 1988–2010

_Source of data:_ IBM, 10-K filings, various years.

The analyst, however, must carefully examine the reasons why this ratio may be changing over time and why it might be out of line with comparable firms in the industry. For example, a declining ratio can be interpreted in two ways. First, the firm may eventually have difficulty adding to capacity via capital expenditures without the need to borrow funds. The second interpretation is that the firm may have gone through a period of major capital expansion and therefore it will take time for revenues to be generated that will increase the cash flow from operations to bring the ratio to some normal long-run level.

Another useful cash flow ratio is the :

_cash flow-to-debt ratio_ where debt can be represented as total debt, long-term debt, or a debt measure that captures a specific range of maturity (e.g., debt maturing in five years). This ratio gives a measure of a company's ability to meet maturing debt obligations. A more specific formulation of this ratio is

Fitch's _CFAR ratio_, which compares a company's three-year average net

 free cash flow to its maturing debt over the next five years By comparing the company's average NFCF to the expected obligations in the near term

(i.e., five years), this ratio provides information on the company's credit quality.

We will see divergences between the cash flow to debt ratio when different definitions of cash flow are used. Consider the cash flow-to-debt ratio calculated using three different measures of cash flow—EBITDA, free cash flow, and cash flow from operations (from the statement of cash flows)

- each compared with long-term debt, as shown in Exhibit 6.8 for Weirton
Steel, which went public in 1989. You can see the effect of capital expenditures in the 1990–1992 period, which causes the difference between the free cash flow measure and the other two measures of cash flow; both
EBITDA and cash flow from operations ignore capital expenditures, which were substantial outflows for this company in the earlier period. In the years after 1999, however, all three indicators agree and suggest there is a problem. The FCF/debt and CFO/debt ratios are similar because capital expenditures in these years were minimal.
EXHIBIT 6.8 Cash Flow-to-Debt Using Alternative Estimates of Cash
Flow for Weirton Steel, 1990–2004
_Source of data:_ Weirton Steel, 10-K filings, various years.
Weirton's severe drop in EBITDA/debt reflects the fact that the cost of sales was substantially greater than net sales in those years (2001 and
2002). Cash flow from operations and, therefore, free cash flow did not drop as dramatically in those years because the company benefited from tax-loss carryovers, which provided benefit to net income and the aforementioned cash flows. EBITDA provided a strong signal that there were problems.
### Patterns of Cash Flows

The analysis of cash flows provides information that can be used along with

- ther financial data to help the analyst assess the financial condition of a company. Cash flow information may help the analyst identify companies that may encounter financial difficulties. Consider the study by Largay and
Stickney that analyzed the financial statements of W. T. Grant during the
1966-1974 period preceding its bankruptcy in 1975 and ultimate
 liquidation They noted that financial indicators such as profitability ratios, turnover ratios, and liquidity ratios showed some down trends, but provided no definite clues to the company's impending bankruptcy.
A study of cash flows from operations, however, revealed that company
- perations were causing an increasing drain on cash, rather than providing cash  25
This necessitated an increased use of external financing, the required interest payments on which exacerbated the cash flow drain. Cash flow analysis clearly was a valuable tool in this case since W. T. Grant had been running a negative cash flow from operations for years. Yet none of the traditional ratios discussed above take into account the cash flow from
- perations. Use of the cash flow-to-capital expenditures ratio and the cash flow-to-debt ratio would have highlighted the company's difficulties.
Dugan and Samson examined the use of operating cash flow as an early
 warning signal of a company's potential financial problems The subject of
 warning signal of a company's potential financial problems The subject of the study was Allied Products Corporation, because for a decade this company exhibited a significant divergence between cash flow from
- perations and net income. For parts of the period, net income was positive while cash flow from operations was a large negative value. In contrast to
W. T. Grant, which went into bankruptcy, the auditor's report in the 1991
Annual Report of Allied Products Corporation did issue a growing concern warning. Moreover, the stock traded in the range of \$2 to \$3 per share.
There was then a turnaround of the company by 1995. In its 1995 annual report, net income increased dramatically from prior periods (to \$34 million) and there was a positive cash flow from operations (\$29 million).
The stock traded in the 25 range by the Spring of 1996  As with the W. T.
27 As with the W. T.
Grant study, Dugan and Samson found that the economic realities of a company are better reflected in its cash flow from operations.
The importance of cash flow analysis in bankruptcy prediction is supported by the study by Benjamin Foster and Terry Ward, who compared trends in the statement of cash flow components—cash flow from
- perations, cash flow for investment, and cash flow for financing—between healthy companies and companies that subsequently sought bankruptcy.28
They observe that healthy companies tend to have relatively stable relations among the cash flows for the three sources, correcting any given year's deviation from their norm within one year. They also observe that unhealthy companies exhibit declining cash flows from operations and financing and declining cash flows for investment one and two years prior to the bankruptcy. Further, unhealthy companies tend to expend more cash flows to financing sources than they bring in during the year prior to bankruptcy.
These studies illustrate the importance of examining cash flow information in assessing the financial condition of a company.
We can see this pattern for Weirton Steel, which went public in 1989 and filed for bankruptcy in 2003. The cash flows follow the pattern outlined by
Foster and Ward, as we show in Exhibit 6.9.
EXHIBIT 6.9 Cash Flows for Weirton Steel, 1990–2002
_Source of data:_ Weirton Steel, 10-K filings, various years.
### Cash Waterfall

Another way of looking at the cash flows is to construct a cash waterfall, based on the statement of cash flows. A _cash waterfall_ is a summary of the major sources and uses of funds and a summary of their effects on the company's cash balance over a year or a series of years.

As an example, consider J. C. Penney once again, using its statement of cash flows for fiscal years 2006 through 2010. As we show in Exhibit 6.10, the predominant force in creating cash flows has been from operations, whereas the predominant use of cash flows has been investments in property, plant, and equipment.

EXHIBIT 6.10 Cash Waterfall for J. C. Penney, 2006 through 2010

### Company Performance

Cash flow and free cash flow are often used as metrics to gauge whether the financial performance of a company is sustainable. A company that is able to consistently generate cash flow in excess of capital expenditures is considered to have the flexibility to expand as new investment opportunities arise and/or to pay additional dividends to shareholders.

Another use of cash flow in performance is in executive compensation.

Part of the compensation of the CEO of General Electric is in the form of performance shares that are granted based on the growth of cash flow from



- perations And General Electric is not the only company tying

- perations And General Electric is not the only company tying compensation to a measure of cash flow; other examples include Comcast
Corporation, Dow Chemical Company, Kraft Foods, Inc., Motorola, Inc.,
Walt Disney Company, and Washington Post Co. For example, the CEO of
Kraft, Irene Rosenfeld, in 2011 has compensation that is based 20\% on free
 cash flow targets
## SUMMARY

_Cash flow_ has many meanings and the analyst's challenge is to determine the cash flow definition and calculation that is appropriate. The simplest calculation of cash flow is the sum of net income and noncash expenses.

This measure, however, does not consider other sources and uses of cash during the period. The statement of cash flows provides a useful breakdown

- f the sources of cash flows: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Though attention is generally focused on the cash flows from operations, the analyst must also examine what the company does with the cash flows (i.e., investing or paying off financing obligations) and what are the sources of invested funds (i.e., operations versus external financing). Minor adjustments can be made to the items classified in the statement of cash flows to improve the classification.
The analyst can examine different patterns of cash flows to get a general idea of the activities of the company. For example, a company whose only
source of cash flow is from investing activities, suggesting the sale of property or equipment, may be experiencing financial distress.
Free cash flow is a company's cash flow that remains after making capital investments that maintain the company's current rate of growth. It is not possible to calculate free cash flow precisely, resulting in many different variations in calculations of this measure. A company that generates free cash flow is not necessarily performing well or poorly. However, the existence of free cash flow must be taken in context with other financial data and information on the company. Variations in the calculation of free cash flow include free cash flow for the firm and net free cash flow. These are measures of the funds available to service additional obligations to suppliers of capital.

4. EBITDA, in fact, became popular in company discussion of earnings by
Internet companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s because EBITDA does not reflect the substantial interest expense and amortization that they experienced, hence providing a rosier financial picture than net income or cash flow from operations. There is no standard for calculating EBITDA, so investors should be cautious in interpreting companies' reports of
EBITDA, as they would with any pro forma earnings value.

# Part Three Applying Financial Analysis
# CHAPTER 7 Measuring Company Performance

In previous chapters, we saw that we can use financial statement information, and the ratio analysis of these statements, to get an idea of a company's performance. However, financial statement information may be problematic. Accounting principles are continually updated to provide for the best representation of a company's operating performance and financial position, yet because we apply a set of general accounting principles to companies in a variety of businesses, and because that financial information can be managed through a judicious use of accounting principles, concerns are raised about whether financial statement information is useful in financial analysis and valuation. Further, just looking at the values and income from the reported financial statements does not provide all the information we need to make projections about the future performance of a company.

So why not just look at stock prices as a measure of performance? If we dispose of financial statement information and focus solely on stock prices we have simply substituted one set of concerns for another. Evaluating a company's performance is much more challenging than looking at stock prices. If stock prices rise in a given period, does that mean the company is doing well? Not necessarily—the stock price may not be as high as it should be, given economic and market conditions. If a company's stock price declines during a given period, does that mean that the company is doing poorly? Not necessarily—the stock's price may be higher than expected given current economic and market conditions.

Arising from the need for better methods of evaluating performance, several consulting companies advocate performance evaluation methods that are applied to evaluate a company's performance as a whole and to evaluate specific managers' performances. These methods are, in some cases, supplanting traditional methods of measuring performance, such as the return-on-assets. As a class, these measures are often referred to as

_value-based metrics_ or _economic value-added_ measures, though there is a cacophony of acronyms to accompany these measures, including economic value added (EVA®), market value added (MVA), cash flow return on investment (CFROI), shareholder value added (SVA), cash value added

(CVA), and refined economic value added (REVA).1

A company's management creates value when decisions are made that provide benefits that exceed the costs. These benefits may be received in the near or distant future, and the costs include both the direct cost of the investment, as well as the less obvious cost, the cost of capital. The _cost of_

_capital_ is the explicit and implicit cost associated with using investors' funds. It is the attention to the cost of capital that sets the value-based metrics apart from traditional measures of performance.

This is a basic theme of capital budgeting: A company should only invest in projects that enhance the value of the company. So where do these valueenhancing projects come from? In a competitive market for investment

- pportunities, where many companies compete for available investment
- pportunities, there should be no value-enhancing projects. In other words, the cost of a project should be bid upward through competition so there is no net benefit from investing in the project. This explanation is rather gloomy and ignores the true source of value-enhancing projects: a company's comparative or competitive advantage. It is only through some advantage, vis-à-vis one's competitors, that allows companies to invest in
 projects that enhance value In cases where there are no impediments to investment (that is, there is a competitive market for investments), it is only through having some type of advantage that a company can invest in something and get more back in return.
Stepping back from looking at individual projects to looking at an entire company, we can apply the same basic principles. If the company's investments provide future benefits greater than its costs, the investments enhance the value of the company. If the company's investments provide future benefits that are less than the investment costs, this is detrimental to
3,4
 the value of the company
From the perspective of analysts, the focus of performance evaluation is
- n the company as a whole, not on individual investment decisions within the company. The key to evaluating a company's performance is therefore whether the company's investment decisions, as a whole, are producing value for the shareholders. But there is no obvious technique to accomplish this because (1) we do not have the ability to perfectly forecast future cash flows from these investments; (2) we do not have accurate measures of the risks of each investment; and (3) we do not know the precise cost of capital.
Therefore, we are left with using proxies (however imperfect) to assess a company's performance.
What makes a good performance measure? Ideally, a measure of a company's performance should have several characteristics:
**1.** The measure should not be sensitive to the choice of accounting methods.
**2.** The measure should evaluate the company's current decisions in light
  of the expected future results.
**3.** The measure should consider the risk associated with the decisions made by the company.
**4.** The measure should neither penalize nor reward the company for factors outside of its control, such as market movements and unanticipated changes in the economy.
## TRADITIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES

The most widely cited performance measures are return-on-investment ratios, including the return on assets and the return on equity: and

Generally, we associate higher return ratios with better performance.

Return ratios are typically used in two ways. First, we often compare return ratios over time for a given company, where it is the trend, rather than the actual return for a particular period, which indicates performance. Second, we often compare return ratios across companies or with a benchmark, such as an industry average return or the return for the industry leaders.

An advantage of using return ratios in evaluating companies' performances is the ease of calculation. All information necessary for the calculation is readily available, either from financial statements or from market data. And, since the return is expressed as a percentage of the investment, its interpretation is straightforward.

An attractive feature of return ratios is the ability to decompose the return ratio to examine the source of changes in returns. As we saw in an earlier chapter, we can use the DuPont system to analyze return ratios, by breaking the return ratios into their activity, profit, and other components. This allows us to further evaluate the source of the return changes from year-toyear and to evaluate differences across companies.

A problem with the return on equity as a performance measure, despite its popularity, is that it can be managed through financing strategies. For example, if a company buys back its stock, the denominator will shrink and the return will increase. As another example, if the company borrows more, its financial leverage increases, increasing the return on equity. In both of these strategies, the company is more highly leveraged and therefore has more financial risk.

The return on assets is not affected by financing strategies, so it is

 preferred by some to the return on equity This is especially important when comparing firms in the same industry: they have similar business risk, but likely different financial risk (i.e., capital structures).

In calculating the return on assets, there are several variations, including:

**1.** Adding interest expense to net income to mitigate some of the effects

  of the financing decisions.
**2.** Using average assets during the year, which helps bring the denominator in synch with the numerator (a flow for the year).
Return on investment measures may not be the best measures of performance for a number of reasons. First, we form return on investment ratios using financial statement data in the numerator and/or the denominator and therefore these ratios are sensitive to the choice of accounting methods. And this sensitivity to accounting methods makes it difficult to compare return ratios across companies and across time, requiring an adjustment of the accounting data to place return ratios on the same accounting basis.
Second, in creating these ratios, we are using financial data that is an accumulation of monetary values from different time periods. For example, the gross plant account includes the cost of assets purchased at different points in time. If there is significant inflation in some of the historical periods, this results in an “apples and oranges” addition problem for most accounts that affects total assets and equity, distorting the calculated returns
- n investment.
Third, return-on-investment ratios are backward-looking, not forwardlooking. Though the immediate effects of current investments influence the return ratios, the expected future benefits from current period decisions are generally not incorporated in the return ratios.
A fourth reason for the deficiency of return-on-investment ratios is that they fail to consider risk. These ratios simply use historical financial statement data that in no way reflect the uncertainty the company faces.
Finally, the return-on-investment ratios do not adjust for controllable versus uncontrollable factors. Ideally, we would want to isolate the performance of the company from factors that are outside the control of management. Return on investment ratios simply reflect the bottom line and do not consider any other factors.
## MEASURES OF VALUE ADDED

Before looking at measures of value added, let's first look at the sources of value added, using Michael Porter's five forces. Considering Porter's five forces helps the analyst focus on the company's competitive advantage and identify the company's key sources of value added.

### Porter's Five Forces

Michael Porter analyzed the competitive structure of industries and identified five competitive forces as shown in Exhibit 7.1.6 These forces capture an industry's competitive rivalry:

The bargaining power of suppliers.

The threat of new entrants.

The threat of substitute products.

The bargaining power of buyers.

The degree of rivalry.

EXHIBIT 7.1 Porter's Five Forces

The bargaining power of suppliers is a force related to the providers of inputs—both goods and services. Suppliers' bargaining power is greater when the market in which they operate is dominated by a few large companies, there are no substitutes for the input, the cost of switching inputs is high, the buyers are fragmented with little buying power, and the suppliers may integrate forward to capture higher prices and margins.

The bargaining power of customers is high when they purchase large quantities of goods or services, the buyers are concentrated, the suppliers have high fixed costs, and there are ready substitutes or the buyer could produce the good or service itself.

The threat of new entrants is high when there are few barriers to entry. A barrier to entry is an impediment such as economies of scale, high initial start-up costs, cost advantages due to experience of existing participants, loyalty among customers, and protections such as patents, licenses, copyrights, or regulatory or government action that limits entrants into the industry.

The threat of substitutes is high when there is little brand loyalty among customers, there are no close customer relations, there are low costs to switching goods or services, and there are substitutes that are lower priced.

The competitive rivalry among existing members of the industry is affected by the number and relative size of the companies in the industry, the strategies of the companies, the differentiation among products, and the growth of the sales in the industry.

Porter's forces are, basically, an elaboration of the theories of economics that tell us how a company creates economic profit. Though Porter's forces may be criticized for being oversimplistic in a dynamic economy, they provide a starting point for analysis of a company's ability to add value.

Porter argues that an individual company may create a competitive advantage through relative cost, differentiation, and relative prices. A financial analyst, in evaluating a company's current and future performance, can use these forces and strategies to identify a company's competitive advantage. For it is through a competitive advantage that a company creates value.

### Measures of Value Added

The most prominent of recently developed techniques to evaluate a company's performance is the value-added measures of economic profit and

7 market value added (MVA)  These measures have links to our fundamental

7 market value added (MVA)  These measures have links to our fundamental

8 valuation techniques  Value-added measures are based on the same

8 valuation techniques  Value-added measures are based on the same valuation principles as the net present value capital budgeting technique.

But remember: value is not created out of thin air, but rather from a company's competitive advantage.

A net present value for a specific investment project is the estimate of change in the value of equity if the company invests in the project. The value-added measures also produce an estimate of the change in the value

- f the company, but relate to the company as a whole, rather than a specific project. Further, whereas net present value is forward looking, assisting management in making decisions dealing with the use of capital in the future, measuring a period's performance using value-added measures focuses on the decisions that have been made during a period and the cost
- f capital that supported those investment decisions to help us gauge how well the company has performed.
There are a number of value-added measures that an analyst can calculate.
The most commonly used measures are economic profit and market value added. Key elements of estimating economic profit are the:
Calculation of the company's operating profit from financial statement data, making adjustments to accounting profit to better reflect a company's results for a period.
Calculation of the company's cost of capital.
Comparison of operating profit with the cost of capital.
The difference between the operating profit and the cost of capital is the estimate of the company's economic profit, or economic value added.
A related measure, market value added, focuses on the market value of capital, as compared to the cost of capital. The key elements of market value added are the:
Calculation of the market value of capital.
Calculation of the capital invested.
Comparison of the market value of capital with the capital invested.
The difference between the market value of capital and the amount of capital invested is the market value added. The primary distinction between economic value added and market value added is that the latter incorporates market data in the calculation.
It is difficult to measure whether a company's management has increased
- r decreased a company's value during a period because a company's value may be affected by many factors. Currently advocated performance measurement techniques, such as Stern Stewart's EVA® and MVA, are based on valuation principles. However, there is an important distinction between valuation and performance measurement: Valuation relies on forecasts, whereas performance measurement must rely on actual results.
### Economic Profit

Many U.S. corporations embraced a method of evaluating and rewarding management performance that is based on the idea of compensating management for economic profit, rather than for its accounting profit. What is economic profit? _Economic profit_ is the difference between revenues and costs, where the costs include not only expenses, but also the cost of capital.

And though the application of economic profit is relatively new in the measurement of performance, the concept of economic profit is not—it was

9 first noted by Alfred Marshall in the nineteenth century  What this recent emphasis on economic profit has done is focus attention away from accounting profit and towards economic profit.

The _cost of capital_ is the rate of return that is required by the suppliers of capital to the company. For a business that finances its operations or investments using both debt and equity, the cost of capital includes not only the explicit interest on the debt, but also the implicit minimum return that

- wners require. This minimum return to owners is necessary so that owners keep their investment capital in the company.
So, where does economic profit come from? From the company's competitive or comparative advantage. The challenge that the analyst faces is examining the company in light of Porter's “five forces” and identifying what advantages, if any, a company has. For it is only through these advantages that a company can generate a sustainable economic profit and, hence, create value. In other words, a company creates value when it generates profit over and above that expected for the level of risk it assumes
- therefore “clearing” the hurdle that is its cost of capital.
### Economic Profit vs. Accounting Profit

There are two important distinctions between accounting profit and economic profit. The first distinction deals with the cost of capital.

Accounting profit is the difference between revenues and costs, based on the representation of these items according to accounting principles.

Economic profit is also the difference between revenues and costs, but, unlike the determination of accounting profit, we include the cost of capital in the costs.

The second distinction between accounting and economic profit deals with the principles of recognition of revenues and costs. We determine accounting profits based on the accrual method, whereas we calculate economic profits using cash-basis accounting. However, since the only data reported in financial statements is in terms of accrual accounting, analysts calculating economic profits must first start with accounting profits and then make adjustments to place the data on a cash basis. This adjustment is imperfect, but does help us better gauge performance than relying solely on accounting profits.

Further, we make adjustments to accounting profits to compensate for distortions that may arise from the choice of particular accounting methods.

For example, companies with operating leases account for these leases as rental expenses, with no liability on the balance sheet; however, analysts

- ften capitalize these leases to make their presentations similar to that of capital leases. Unlike accounting profit, economic profit (if measured accurately) cannot be manipulated by management through the choice of accounting methods.
In addition to the use of economic profit measures for compensating managers, financial analysts are incorporating the basic principles of economic profit in their assessment of corporate success. Performance measures based on economic profit are known by several different names, including market value added (MVA), economic value added (EVA®), and excess shareholder value.
### Economic Profit and Net Present Value

We estimate economic profit in a manner analogous to the net present value method of evaluating investments. Though attractive in principle, there are many pitfalls associated with the application of the net present value capital budgeting technique to actual companies. These pitfalls include (1) the use

- f accounting data to determine economic profit, and (2) the estimation of
 the cost of capital
Just as the net present value of a project produces results that are sensitive to the cost of capital, so does the economic profit approach. Any slight change in the cost of capital estimate may change the estimated value added from positive to negative or vice-versa. In other words, whether we view a company's performance as value-destroying or value-enhancing is sensitive to the estimates used in the calculation.
The net present value method, as applied in the context of evaluating performance of companies and management, was brought to prominence by
G. Bennett Stewart III in his book _A Quest for Value: A Guide for Senior_
_Managers_ (New York: HarperCollins, 1991) and through the consulting work by Stern Stewart.
### Calculating Economic Profit

Economic profit, referred to as _economic value added_, is the difference between operating profits and the cost of capital, where the cost of capital is expressed in dollar terms. The application to an entire company involves, essentially, calculating the net present value of all investment projects, both those involving existing assets (that is, past investment decisions) and those projected.

 11

We can describe economic profit as

- r, equivalently, using the spread between the rate of return and the percentage cost of capital, where the return on capital is the ratio of net operating profit after taxes to capital.
Application of this formula produces an estimate of the economic profit for a single period. In evaluating a company's performance for a given period, economic profit reflects whether value is added (a positive economic profit) or reduced (a negative economic profit). Each element of this formula is discussed in detail next.
#### Net Operating Profit after Taxes

There are two important elements in the calculation of _net operating profit_

_after taxes_ (NOPAT): operating profit after depreciation and cash operating taxes. NOPAT is income from operations, but after we remove the taxes on are a cash basis that are related to operating income. _Cash operating taxes_ taxes on operating income, placed on a cash basis.

Operating income _after_ depreciation is used rather than the traditional

- perating income _before_ depreciation because depreciation is considered an economic expense: Depreciation is a measure of how much of an asset is used up in the period, which gives us an idea of how much must be expended to maintain operations at the existing level.
In addition to using cash operating taxes instead of the tax expense on the income statement, there are several adjustments intended to alter accounting profit to better reflect economic profit. However, because these adjustments involve adjusting accounting profit to arrive at economic profit, these adjustments must be tailored to the company's specific accounting practices and situation.
Whether you start with operating profit after depreciation (the “bottomup” approach),
- r begin with sales (the “top-down” approach), we arrive at net operating profit after taxes, that is, NOPAT.
Let's calculate 2010 NOPAT for McDonald's Corporation to see how these adjustments are made to actual company data. Using the basic income statement data as presented as an example in Exhibit 7.2, balance sheet data in Exhibit 7.3, financial statement note information (not shown in table), and the bottom-up approach, we begin with operating profit after depreciation and amortization (i.e., operating income) of 3,540.5 million.

Most of the information necessary to make the adjustments is available directly from the financial statements or the notes to financial statements.

The only adjustment applicable to McDonald's is for implied interest on

- perating leases, which is implied from future rental commitments, as detailed in the “Leasing arrangements” note of the McDonald's Corporation

2010 annual report
McDonald's implied interest expense on operating leases must be calculated using note information. The interest expense is estimated as the interest cost on the change in the average value of leases during the year.
This requires estimating the present value of leases at the beginning and end
- f the year.
We calculate the present value of operating leases by discounting minimum rental commitments on operating leases for the next five years.
These minimum rental commitments are disclosed in a footnote to the financial statements. In the case of McDonald's, the expected future commitments be - nd 2010 are as follows: y

|Col1|OperatingLeaseRentalCommitment(inmillions)|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Year following|2010|2009|
|First year|\$1,201|\$1,119.4|
|Second year|1,116|1,046.5|
|Third year|1,034|963.4|
|Fourth year|926|885.4|
|Fifth year|827|805.9|
|Beyond the fifth year|\$11,121|\$10,717.5|

Using a discount rate of 5.5\% (the approximate yield on McDonald's debt in 2010), the present value of the first five years of commitments is

4,402 million. Because many companies disclose only rental commitments for the next five years, the value of the commitments beyond the fifth year are often ignored in the determination of capital. In the case of McDonald's,

 this may amount to a large difference in estimated debt capital

Repeating the same analysis for 2009, the present value of the operating leases is 4,135 million. The average lease value for 2010 is therefore

($4,064 + 4,135) ÷ 2 = $4,277 million. Using an interest rate of 5.5\%, the interest on the leases is estimated to be 235.26 million. This implied interest is backed out of operating profit because it represents a financing cost that is deducted to arrive at reported operating profit.

Starting with the operating profit after depreciation and amortization from

|the 2010 income statement, adjusted McDonald's is calculated as:|operating profit|
|---|---|
||Amount (in millions)|
|Operating profit after depreciation and amortization|7,473.1|
|Add: Implied interest on operating leases|235.3|
|||
|Adjusted operating profit before taxes|7,708.4|

### Cash-Operating Taxes

Cash-operating taxes are estimated by starting with the income tax expense and adjusting this expense for:

**1.** Changes in deferred taxes.

**2.** The tax benefit from the interest deduction (for both explicit and implicit interest) to remove the tax effect of financing with debt.

**3.** Taxes from other nonoperating income or expense and special items  14

The change in deferred taxes is removed from the income tax expense because: an increase in deferred taxes means that a portion of the income tax expense that is deferred is not a cash outlay for the period, and a decrease in deferred taxes means that the income tax expense understates the true cash expense.

The tax benefit from interest is added back to taxes so that the cash taxes reflect the taxes from operations. This gross-up of taxes isolates the taxes from any financing effects. This tax benefit is the reduction of taxes from the deductibility of interest expense:

The taxes from other nonoperating income and special items (e.g., sales

- f investment interest) are also removed so that the cash taxes reflect solely those taxes related to operations.
Let's look at an example using the McDonald's 2010 financial data. First, we calculate cash taxes, using a marginal tax rate of 35\%, as we show in
Exhibit 7.4.
Subtracting cash operating taxes from the adjusted operating profit roduces net o eratin rofit after taxes p p g p (NOPAT):

|Col1|Amount(inmillions)|
|---|---|
|Adjusted operating profit before taxes|7,708.4|
|Less: Cash operating taxes|2,237.2|
|||
|Net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT)|5,471.2|

**EXHIBIT 7.4** Calculation of Cash Operating Taxes for McDonald's, 2010
This approach to calculating NOPAT is a “bottom-up” approach since it starts with operating profit after depreciation and amortization and builds to
NOPAT. Another approach is a “top-down” approach, where we start with sales and adjust to arrive at NOPAT. In the case of McDonald's for 2010, the
NOPAT is shown in Exhibit 7.5.
**EXHIBIT 7.5** Top-Down Calculation of NOPAT for McDonald's, 2010
Whether we use the top-down approach or the bottom-up approach, we can arrive at the NOPAT of 5,471.2 million.
### Capital

_Capital_ in this context is the sum of net working capital, net property and equipment, goodwill, and other assets. Another way of looking at capital is that it is the sum of the long-term sources of financing, both debt and equity, that are invested in the company. Therefore, this sum is often referred to as .

_invested capital_

When calculating a company's capital, we need to make several adjustments to reported accounts to correct for possible distortions arising from accounting methods. For example, we adjust inventory for any LIFO reserve, we include the present value of operating leases as part of invested capital, and we add back any accumulated goodwill amortization to capital.

We must peruse the footnotes for the financial statements to arrive at these adjustments. The calculation of capital should, ideally, be tailored to reflect each company's financial accounting. You will also notice that the adjustments we made to arrive at NOPAT have companion adjustments to arrive at capital. And, as with the NOPAT calculations, we can arrive at capital by starting at either of two points: total assets (the asset approach) or book value of equity (sources-of-financing approach).

Using the asset approach, we begin with net operating assets and then make adjustments to reflect total invested capital:

For example, it can be argued that goodwill generated from paying more when acquiring a company than its assets' book value is an investment.

Using this reasoning, we add both goodwill and prior periods' amortization



- f goodwill to capital to reflect the company's asset investment
Using another approach, the source-of-financing approach, we begin with the book value of common equity and add debt, equity equivalents, and debt equivalents:
Continuing our example using McDonald's, we estimate capital using the asset approach. We begin with net operating assets and adjust for plant and equipment, other assets, and the value of the operating leases. _Operating_
_current assets_ include cash, marketable securities, receivables, inventories, and other current assets. For McDonald's in 2010, these amount to
4,368.5 million  _Net operating assets_ are operating current assets, less
- perating current liabilities, such as accounts payable, which are
1,652.8 million for McDonald's.
We show our calculations of McDonald's capital in Exhibit 7.6 (starting with net operating assets) and Exhibit 7.7 (starting with the book value of common equity). In either calculation, the amount of capital for
McDonald's for the 2010 fiscal year is 33,537 million.
**EXHIBIT 7.6** Calculation of Capital for McDonald's Using the Asset Approach, 2010
**EXHIBIT 7.7** Calculation of Capital for McDonald's Using the Sources-of-Financing Approach,
Some consultants make a further distinction between invested capital (as
17 described above) and operating capital  _Operating capital_ is invested capital less goodwill. In other words, operating capital is the amount of the investment employed in operations. Goodwill is removed as capital because
 it tends to be distorted by premiums paid in acquiring other companies
Goodwill for McDonald's in 2010 is \$2,586.1 million and accumulated goodwill amortization is not determinable from published financial statements. Removing goodwill from invested capital produces operating capital of \$30,950.9 million.
### Return on Capital

We calculate the _return on capital_ by dividing operating income after taxes by capital. This measure is a return on investment measure, using NOPAT instead of accounting profit:

The return on capital for McDonald's is the ratio of the NOPAT to invested capital, or

The return on operating capital for McDonald's is somewhat higher because of the exclusion of goodwill in the denominator:

Which return measure is best to use in evaluating McDonald's? It depends

- n whether you are focusing on (1) McDonald's ability to profitably and efficiently use investors' funds (including funds used to acquire other companies at a premium), which requires use of the former measure; or (2)
McDonald's ability to profitably and efficiently use its operating assets
(allowing better comparability across companies in the same industry), which requires the use of the latter measure.
### Cost of Capital

The _cost of capital_ is the cost of raising additional funds from debt and equity sources. For each source, there is a cost. Once the cost of each source

- f capital is determined, the cost of capital for the company is calculated as a weighted average of each cost, where the weight represents the proportionate use of each source.
The cost of debt is the after-tax cost of debt, _rd_ *, adjusted for the benefit from the tax-deductibility of interest: where the before tax rate, _rd_, is the prevailing yield on long-term bonds of companies with similar credit risk. For example, at the end of 2010, bonds
- f similar risk to McDonald's yielded approximately 5.5\%. Using the marginal tax rate of 35\%, the after-tax cost of debt for McDonald's is
There are different methods used to estimate the _cost of equity capital_, which is the return that shareholders require on their investment. Using the widely accept approach that is based on the capital asset pricing model, the cost of equity capital is the sum of the risk-free rate of interest and the premium for bearing market risk: where _rf_ is the risk-free rate of interest, _rm_ is the expected return on the
 market, and β is the stock's beta
This calculation is not as straightforward as it looks. One issue is the appropriate proxy for the risk-free rate. The risk-free rate of interest should, theoretically, be the return on a zero-beta portfolio with a duration similar to the holding period of the investor. Because this estimation task is extremely difficult, an alternative is to proxy the risk-free rate using rates on securities that market participants might view as having no default risk or very minimal default risk; that is, U.S. government debt. If a government
- bligation with a short duration is used, such as a Treasury bill, there is a mismatch of the duration between the Treasury bill and the risk-free portfolio. A more suitable proxy is the 10-year Treasury bond because this
 matches the duration of the market portfolio
_r_                          - _r_
Another issue is the premium for market risk, ( _m_ _f_ ). Stewart advocated a 6\% market risk premium, based on the historical spread between the
 return on the market and the return on long-term government bonds
Copeland, Koller, and Murrin advocate a slightly different approach, using the difference between the geometric mean return on the market and that of the long-term government bonds, both calculated over a long time frame.
They estimate that the risk premium may range between 3\% and 8\%, and that the estimate is sensitive to the period over which the estimate is made.
Damodaran uses a value in between these two, 5.5\%, in his estimations
More recent evidence suggests a risk premium around 3.5\% coinciding with the recent financial crisis  23
For the purposes of demonstrating the calculation, we use a 5\% market risk premium.
The market risk premium is tailored to the company's specific risk premium by multiplying the market risk premium by the company's common stock beta, β. The beta is a measure of the sensitivity of the returns
- n the company's stock to changes in the returns on the market. Estimates
- f beta are readily available from financial services such as MSCI Barra,
Standard and Poor's Compustat, Yahoo! Finance, or Value Line.
McDonald's beta is 0.65  24
Using the 10-year Treasury bond rate of 3.3\%, a market risk premium of 5\%, and a beta of 0.65, McDonald's cost of equity is
In sum, the cost of capital of McDonald's is comprised of the cost of debt
- f 3.575\% and the cost of equity of 6.55\%. We weight the costs of debt and equity using the proportions each represents in the capital structure to arrive at a cost of capital for the company.
The first step is to determine the book-values of debt and equity. One method is to use the debt and equity book values that we determined in the calculation of capital. Another method is to estimate the market value of the capital components. This requires estimating the market value of both debt and equity.
McDonald's capital structure at the end of 2009 (and hence the beginning
 25
- f 2010) consists of
McDonald's capital structure at the end of 2010 consists of:
Additions and subtractions to debt and equity capital are made throughout the year. Because of this and the lack of specific data on changes in capital, we can approximate the capital proportions by averaging the beginning and ending capital proportions for the year. Using book values, this gives us approximately 52\% debt and 48\% equity. The weighted average cost of capital using the book weights and a 9.5\% cost of equity, is
Using market value weights, the cost of capital is greater because approximately 71.1\% of its capital is equity:
Which do we use: 5.1\% or 6\%? In most applications, we choose the method that best reflects the marginal cost of funds. If the company raises an additional dollar of capital, in what proportion does it raise these funds?
We usually think of this in terms of the market value proportions, using the
6\% cost of capital. But in this particular application, we are applying this cost of capital against the invested capital, which is most often stated in terms of book values. Mixing a market value determined cost of capital
26 with book value of invested capital results in distortions  Therefore, we use the book value weighted cost of capital in determining economic profit (that is, the 5.1\%).
### Economic Profit and Performance

Economic profit is the profit generated during the period in excess of what is required by investors for the level of risk associated with the company's investments. Economic profit is analogous to the net present value of capital budgeting, and represents the value added by the company's management during the period.

Suppose we assume that McDonald's cost of capital is 6\%. Using the two, equivalent economic profit calculations, we see that McDonald's management generated an economic profit in 2010:

McDonald's earned an economic profit of 3,460.1 million in 2010. In

- ther words, McDonald's management added value during 2010.
Though it seems that McDonald's added value during the period, as represented by the estimate of economic profit, the estimate of economic profit is always sensitive to the estimate of the cost of capital. The cost of capital is something that is difficult to measure. Looking at a range of cost
- f capital, plus and minus 100 basis points, gives an idea of this sensitivity:
Drawing a conclusion regarding the degree of profitability depends, in large part, on the estimated cost of capital, among other assumptions.
### Market Value Added

A measure closely related to economic profit is market valued added.

Market value added is the difference between the company's market value and its capital. Essentially, market value added is a measure of what the company's management has been able to do with a given level of resources

(the invested capital):

Like economic profit, market value added is in terms of dollars and the goal of the company is to increase added value. Being top of the list of companies ranked on the basis of market value added does not mean that the company has outperformed other companies. It merely means that the company has the greatest difference between its book and market values of capital—accumulated over time. Rather, performance is evaluated by looking at the _change_ in market value added over a period. The change in the market value added is a measure of how effectively the company's management employs capital to enhance the value of capital to _all_ suppliers



- f capital, not just common shareholders The change in market value added is the change in the market value of capital (debt and equity), less the change in the book value of capital.
Looking once again at McDonald's, we see the following for 2010 and
2009:
This analysis tells us that McDonald's management has increased the market value added in 2010, adding 12,991.4 million more in market value in excess of invested capital.
It is often the case in application that the book value of debt and the book value of preferred stock are used in estimating both the market value of
 capital and the book value of capital Therefore, the change in market value added from one year to the next amounts to the change in the market value of common equity, plus the change in the book value of debt and preferred stock. Because of this measurement of market value added, the change in market value added is determined, in large part, by the change in the market value of the common stock. Therefore, the change in market value is affected by the change in the value of the market in general.
### Reconciling Economic Value Added with Market Value Added

There are two different value added measures: economic value added

(economic profit) and market value added. Economic value added is based

- n the adjusted operating earnings (after taxes), invested capital, and the company's weighted average cost of capital. Market value added is based on a comparison of invested capital with the market value of capital. These two measures are both designed to help evaluate the performance of a company.
There is a logical link, however, between market value added and economic profit. The market value added should be equal to the present value of future periods' economic profit, discounted at the cost of capital. If we assume that the company will generate future-period economic profit equivalent to this period's economic profit, in perpetuity, the relation between market value and economic profit is a simple one:
Yet, the perpetuity assumption is not valid for most companies because of a very basic notion: economic profits are generated only when a company has some comparative or competitive advantage. Most companies cannot maintain these advantages for long periods of time; for example, government regulations may change, patents are not perpetual, and demographics change, all of which can erode a company's advantage and, hence, its economic profit. Therefore, the assumption of a perpetual stream
- f the current period's economic profit is not reasonable in most cases.
Another reason why this relation does not hold in application is that the methods of determining economic profit and market value added are quite different. Economic value added is a single-period measure, estimated using accounting data and an estimated cost of capital. Market value added employs market values, which are more forward-looking estimates of performance. In practice, however, economic profit and market value added
29,30
 may result in conflicting evaluations of performance
Still another reason why this relation does not hold true is that the estimates of economic profit are just that—estimates. Economic profit is estimated by starting with accounting data and making adjustments to better reflect economic reality. However careful an analyst is in adjusting the accounting data, the estimated economic profit cannot precisely reflect true economic profit.
### Challenges in Applying Value-Added Measures

Even advocates of economic profit do not prescribe a particular formula for calculating economic profit. Economic profit has ambiguous elements, most

 notably the adjustments to operating income and the cost of capital

Conceivably, two analysts could calculate economic profit, yet draw different conclusions regarding companies' relative performance.

The calculation of operating income (i.e., NOPAT) requires that each company be treated as an individual case. The adjustments to arrive at

- perating profits after taxes are different for each company and there may be over 150 adjustments applied. This makes it difficult to apply from the perspective of the financial analyst who must rely on financial statements and other publicly available information to determine economic profit.
Though a formula could be developed to deal with the most common adjustments, there are always exceptions to the general rules that must be dealt with.
There are also many ambiguities regarding the measurement of the cost of capital. One problem is determining the best model for the estimate of the cost of equity. Should the analyst use the capital asset pricing model or the dividend valuation model ~~?~~ 32 Suppose the analyst uses the capital asset pricing model, which requires specifying a market risk premium (that is, the additional required return for bearing market risk). Should the market risk premium be 5\%? 6\%? In some cases the choice matters, making the difference between a value-adding company and a value-destroying company.
Another problem with the estimation of the cost of capital is the choice of weights to apply to the difference costs of capital. Though market weights are theoretically appealing, many apply weights based on book values.
Whether these issues affect the assessment of performance and relative performance is, of course, an empirical issue.
### But Are Value-Added Measures Better?

Whether the value-added measures aid the financial analyst in assessing the

- perating performance and financial condition of a company is really an
 empirical issue What we know from an analysis of the economic profit
(a.k.a. economic value added) is that it has a solid foundation in economic and financial theory. Using economic profit instead of accounting earnings is attractive because it avoids the problems associated with accounting earnings.
Are companies that generate more economic profit than others better companies? Not necessarily. First, we estimate economic profit as a single period measure, using the current period's financial information. Just like a return on investment ratio, focusing on economic profit is short-sighted. It may be the case that the company is sacrificing future profitability to generate current period economic profit.
Second, we calculate economic profit using the company's cost of capital as the “hurdle.” But if the company has taken on activities that are riskier than the company's typical activities, the calculation of the cost of capital and economic profit may not reflect this increased risk-taking, resulting in an overstatement of current profitability.
Third, NOPAT and the cost of capital are just estimates. Even slight variations in the assumptions and estimates can result in dramatic changes in measured profitability.
Fourth, we state economic profit in dollar terms, but this is misleading when comparing companies of different sizes. According to the Stern
Stewart's 2002 Russell-3000 rankings, Microsoft generated 2,201 million
- f economic profit, whereas Proctor & Gamble Company generated
2,315 million  So which one performed better? Comparing economic profit, Procter & Gamble appears to be approximately the same as
Microsoft, but once you look at the amount of invested capital (that is, what they invested to generate that economic profit), you get a different picture:
Procter & Gamble's invested capital is almost twice that of Microsoft's.
So if there are problems associated with measuring economic profit, what good is it? Well, in theory economic profit is a measure of a company's performance over a period of time, so if we can overcome the measurement issues we have a measure that is superior to accounting income. And if measured in a consistent manner across companies or across time it can be used to compare performance. Further, economic profit in theory is related to market value added: market value added is the present value of future periods' economic profit. If investors' valuation of future economic profit is market value added, and if current and recent periods' economic profits are predictors of future economic profit, we can use economic profit in assessing the value of a share of stock. This suggests that trends in economic profit suggest future value changes. For example, continued improvements in economic profit suggest that value is being added and we should see an increase in market value added. In a similar vein, if economic profit is declining, we should see a decline in market value added.
Suppose that we focus on market value added. Is this a better measure of the performance of a company than, say, return on assets? Going back to the definition of market value added, we see that a company _increases_ its market value when the change in the market value of its capital (that is, the market value of its debt and equity) exceeds the change in its invested capital (that is, book value of its debt and equity). Because most of the measures of market value added use the market value of equity and assume that the market value of debt is equal to the book value of debt, the change in the market value added is really attributed to the change in the stock's price. Therefore, it should be no surprise that the change in the market value added is highly correlated with a company's stock's return.
## SUMMARY

The value-added measures of economic profit and market value added are really nothing new—it is their application in performance measurement within firms and in financial analysis that is new. Economic profit is the

- perating profit of a company less its cost of capital. The calculation of
- perating profit for this purpose requires adjustments to remove distortions resulting from the application selected accounting principles. There can be more than 150 adjustments and these adjustments must be tailored for the individual company.
Traditional performance measures, such as the return on assets, are not forward-looking, do not capture risk, and do not control for factors outside
- f the control of the company. Additionally, unless care is taken in the construction of these measures, these measures may be affected by the choice of accounting methods.
The calculation of economic profit requires financial statement data, notes to financial statements, and, in most cases, information beyond published financial information. This makes the calculation of economic profit challenging to the financial analyst. Calculating economic profit also requires determining the amount of a company's invested capital.
Adjustments to arrive at operating income for the economic profit calculation have companion adjustments to arrive at invested capital. The cost of capital is generally determined by using a weighted average of the costs of capital. However, there are many assumptions and complexities in the calculation of the cost of capital and any estimate is subject to possible measurement error because a company's cost of capital cannot be observed.
Market value added is the difference between the market value of a company's capital and the amount of invested capital (i.e., book values of capital). Performance measurement requires determining the change in market value added because the total market value added is measured over the company's entire history.
If used with the understanding of what the value added measures can and cannot do, the financial analyst may benefit from including these measures along with the traditional measures.

- riginal name of economic profit. Another prominent valuation approach is the discounted cash flow approach, advocated by McKinsey and Co.
This approach involves forecasting future periods' free cash flows, forecasting a company's continuing value at the end of the forecast period, and discounting the future free cash flows and the continuing value at the company's weighted average cost of capital. Because this approach involves valuation based on forecasts, it is not a suitable device for evaluating performance, though it is useful in setting performance targets.

12. Information on change in bad debt reserve is not available in
McDonald's financial statement, likely because these items are immaterial.
Therefore, these adjustments are not made. This illustrates a potential problem in calculating economic profit: the information needed may not be available in published financial reports.
13. If McDonald's rental commitments beyond the fifth year are, say
800 million per year, the difference in estimated debt capital (using a
5.5\% discount rate) is over \$12,000 million: discount the \$800 per year as a perpetuity to the end of the fifth year ($800/0.055 = $14,545.45), and then discount this amount back five years (Present value =
11,129 million).

15. Though goodwill amortization is no longer permitted, many companies have amortized goodwill in the past such that the value reflected on the balance sheet is net of amortized goodwill from years in which goodwill was amortized.
16. Information on bad-debt reserve, capitalized research and development, and cumulative write-offs was not available in the financial statements. The extent to which these omissions affect the resultant economic value-added measure is unknown, but these items are also

25. In addition to estimating the company's most recent market value capital components, it is useful to look at the capital structure of other companies in the industry and to consider the trends in the company's capital structure over time, because the capital structure of a company at a point in time may not reflect the company's target capital structure.
26. The extent of the distortion depends on the relation between the market value of capital and the book value of capital.
27. A related issue is whether the company's management should be striving to maximize the value of the company or to maximize the value of common equity. The market value-added measure focuses on the former, whereas more common measures, such as stock returns, focus on the latter. In general, maximizing the value of the company will result in the maximization of shareholders' wealth.
28. See, for example, Stewart, _The Quest for Value_, 153-154.
9. As we have shown previously, slight differences in the estimated cost of capital can result in quite different conclusions regarding economic profit and, hence, performance.
30. As you can see, this equation is nonsensical in the case in which there is an economic loss and a positive market value added.
31. This is not the fault of economic profit, _per se_, but rather the starting point of the calculations: reported financial statements prepared according to GAAP.
32. Most applications of economic profit use a capital asset pricing model
(CAPM)−based cost of equity. The CAPM has been challenged as inadequately capturing the risk and return relationship (see Eugene F.
Fama and Kenneth. R. French, “The Cross-Section of Expected Stock
Returns,” _Journal of Finance_ 47, no. 2 (1992): 427−465.

# CHAPTER 8 Corporate Credit Analysis

_Corporate credit analysis_ involves the analysis of a multitude of quantitative and qualitative factors over the past, present, and future. The past and present are introductions to what the future may hold. Corporate bond credit analysis involves an analysis of an issuer, and is not done in isolation but in conjunction with a review of the issuer's place within the industry and an overall analysis of where the industry fits within the national economy and, with increasing frequency, the global economy.

Corporate bond credit research and equity research areas historically have been viewed as separate areas, but with the development and application of

- ption theory, these two areas of financial research are now considered to be complementary. In addition, credit risk models that are grounded in
- ption theory are commercially available to investors.
Our purpose in this chapter is to discuss the general principles of corporate credit analysis. We begin with a discussion of the types of credit risk an investor faces when investing in a bond. We then explain the factors to consider in credit analysis: character, capacity, collateral, and covenants.
## TYPES OF CREDIT RISK

An investor who lends funds to a corporation by purchasing its debt

- bligation is exposed to credit risk. But what is credit risk? Credit risk encompasses three types of risk:
**1.** Default risk
**2.** Credit downgrade risk
**3.** Credit spread risk
_Default risk_ is the likelihood that the issuer of debt is not able to meet the promised obligations to pay interest and repay the obligation. _Credit_
_downgrade risk_ is the risk of an increase in default risk. We refer to this risk as
_downgrade risk_ because we often observe that the company's credit rating is downgraded as default risk increases. The yield of a debt
- bligation will reflect the debt's risk, but _credit spread risk_ is the uncertainty that the difference between the yield on a debt instrument and the yield for a benchmark, such as a Treasury bond, will change.
### Default Risk

If a corporate bond issuer fails to make timely payment of interest and principal due to the bondholders or if it violates any provisions set forth in the bond indenture, the issuer is said to default. In that case, the issuer is required to pay off the bond issue immediately. If this cannot be done, the bankruptcy laws take over. The petition for bankruptcy can be filed either by the company itself, in which case it is called a voluntary bankruptcy, or be filed by its creditors, in which case it is called an involuntary bankruptcy.

The laws governing bankruptcy are set forth in the U.S. Bankruptcy

Code

Code  Under these rules, a business may file for reorganization under



Chapter 11 or liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Code The liquidation of a



Chapter 11 or liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Code The liquidation of a corporation means that all the assets will be distributed to the holders of claims of the corporation and no corporate entity will survive. In reorganization, a new corporate entity results. Some holders of the claim of the bankrupt corporation will receive cash in exchange for their claims,

- thers may receive new securities in the corporation that results from the reorganization, and others may receive a combination of both cash and new securities in the resulting corporation.
Many companies that file for Chapter 11 reorganization ultimately are liquidated. For example, Circuit City, an electronics retailer, filed for bankruptcy November 10, 2008, and then liquidated under Chapter 7 in

January 2009 When a company is liquidated, creditors receive distributions based on the _absolute priority rule_ to the extent assets are available. The absolute priority rule is the principle that senior creditors are paid in full before junior creditors are paid anything. For secured and unsecured creditors, the absolute priority rule guarantees their seniority to equity holders.
Many companies that file for Chapter 11 reorganization ultimately are liquidated. For example, Circuit City, an electronics retailer, filed for bankruptcy November 10, 2008, and then liquidated under Chapter 7 in

_Default risk_ is the risk that the corporate borrower will fail to satisfy the terms of a debt obligation, with respect to the timely payment of interest and repayment of the amount borrowed, resulting in a loss of interest and principal. Analysis of the credit default risk of an issuer or issuer is a timeconsuming process. While many large institutional investors have a staff of credit analysts to analyze the credit default risk, retail investors rely on credit ratings assigned to issues by specialist companies, which are referred to as .
_credit rating agencies_
A _credit rating_ is a formal opinion given by a credit rating agency (CRA)
- f the default risk faced by investing in a particular issue of debt securities.
It represents in a simplistic way the rater's assessment of an issuer's ability to meet the payment of principal and interest in accordance with the terms
- f the debt contract. Credit rating symbols or characters are uncomplicated representations of more complex ideas. In effect, they are summary
- pinions and nothing more than opinions.
In the United States, a credit rating firm registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) is a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organization (NRSRO). As of early 2012, there are 10 firms registered with the SEC as NRSROs:
**1.** A. M. Best Company, Inc.
**2.** DBRS Ltd. (Dominion Bond Rating Service)
**3.** Egan-Jones Rating Company
**4.** Fitch, Inc.
**5.** Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd.
**6.** Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. (formerly LACE Financial Corp.)
**7.** Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
**8.** Rating and Investment Information, Inc.
**9.** Realpoint LLC
**10.** ~~s~~ 4
Standard & Poor's Ratings Service
The three major NRSROs are Moody's Investors Service, Standard &
Poor's Ratings Services, and Fitch, followed by DBRS and A. M. Best

Company Although retail investors gauge the default risk of an issue by looking at the credit ratings assigned to issues by one or more of these
CRAs, institutional investors use ratings as a confirmation for their own analysis.
CRAs provide credit ratings for long-term and short-term debt
- bligations. For the long-term debt obligations (debt with an original maturity of more than one year), a credit rating is a forward-looking assessment of the probability of default and the relative magnitude of the loss should a default occur. For short-term debt obligations (debt with an
- riginal maturity of 12 months or less), a credit rating is a forward-looking assessment of the probability of default. There are different rating systems for a given CRA for short-term and long-term debt. While CRAs analyze a company when making their determination of what credit rating to assign, the credit rating is specific to the issue not the issuer.
The rating systems of the CRAs use similar symbols and it bears repeating that they are uncomplicated representations of more complex ideas. In the rating systems of all three rating agencies, the term “high grade” means low credit risk, or conversely, high probability of future payments. The highest-grade bonds are designated by Moody's by the letters Aaa, and by the others as AAA. The next highest grade is Aa
(Moody's), and by the others as AA; for the third grade all CRAs use A.
The next three grades are Baa (Moody's) or BBB, Ba (Moody's) or BB, and
B, respectively. There are also C grades.
S&P and Fitch use plus or minus signs to provide a narrower credit quality breakdown within each class. Moody's uses 1, 2, or 3 for the same purpose. Bonds rated triple A (AAA or Aaa) are said to be “prime”; double
A (AA or Aa) are of high quality; single A issues are called “upper medium grade”; and triple B are “medium grade.” Lower-rated bonds are said to have “speculative” elements or be” distinctly speculative.” Bond issues that are assigned a rating in the top four categories are referred to as _investment-_
.
_grade bonds_
Bond issues that carry a rating below the top four categories are noninvestment-grade bonds or more popularly referred to as _high-yield_
_bonds_ or _junk bonds_ . Thus, we can divide the bond market into two sectors: the investment-grade sector and the noninvestment-grade sector. Distressed debt is a subcategory of noninvestment-grade bonds. These bonds may be in bankruptcy proceedings, may be in default of coupon payments, or may be in some other form of distress.
### Reducing Reliance on External Credit Ratings

There has been a long-standing concern by regulators throughout the world regarding the reliance of investors on credit ratings assigned by NRSROs or

CRAs. One commonly held view is that investors rely exclusively on ratings by CRAs. Another view is that although investors may not rely exclusively on ratings by CRAs, they have come to over rely or excessively rely on ratings. The poor performance of CRAs in the rating of subprime mortgage-backed securities has highlighted this concern. This view is expressed in a report by the Financial Stability Forum: “Investors should address their over-reliance on ratings.  6 In testimony before the U.S. Senate,

John Walsh, acting Comptroller of the Currency, referred to the “undue or exclusive reliance on credit ratings.”

Although the major attack in recent years has been on credit ratings as they pertain to structured products, there is concern that there should be an independent analysis by financial institutions and asset managers of

 corporate credit risk The Financial Stability Forum has proposed a set of

 corporate credit risk The Financial Stability Forum has proposed a set of principles to reduce reliance on CRA ratings in standards, laws, regulations,

 and market practices For example, the first two principles are:

 and market practices For example, the first two principles are:

**Principle I. Reducing reliance on CRA ratings in standards, laws and**

**regulations.**

_Standard setters and authorities should assess references to credit rating_

_agency (CRA) ratings in standards, laws and regulations and, wherever_

_possible, remove them or replace them by suitable alternative standards_



_of creditworthiness_

**Principle II. Reducing market reliance on CRA ratings.**

_Banks, market participants and institutional investors should be expected_

_to make their own credit assessments, and not rely solely or_



_mechanistically on CRA ratings_

**Principle II. Reducing market reliance on CRA ratings.**

_Banks, market participants and institutional investors should be expected_

_to make their own credit assessments, and not rely solely or_



_mechanistically on CRA ratings_

In 1988, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision—a committee of central banks and central bank supervisors of the major industrialized countries—introduced risk-based capital requirements for banks based on the bank's credit risk exposures. These bank regulatory requirements are known as the _Basel I Accord_ . The revised Basel Accord that went into effect in January 2007 relies on an internal rating system developed by banks to assess credit exposure in its portfolio and in derivative transaction with counterparties. The internal rating system used by a bank is subject to strict minimum standards and monitoring by regulators.

The key here is that although one might wonder why it is necessary to learn how to perform credit analysis, because credit evaluations are provided by CRAs, regulators and the financial community at large are moving towards less reliance on such external ratings and more on independent credit analysis.

### Credit Spread Risk

The price performance of a corporate debt obligation and its return over some investment horizon depends on how the credit spread changes. If the credit spread increases, the market price of the debt obligation declines. The risk that an issuer's debt obligation will decline due to an increase in the

.

credit spread is called _credit spread risk_

Credit spread risk exists for an individual issue, debt obligations in a particular industry or economic sector, and for all debt issues in the economy. For example, in general during economic recessions, investors are concerned that issuers will face a decline in cash flows that will be used to service debt obligations. As a result, the credit spread increases for all corporate issuers and the prices of all corporate debt obligations in the market decline.

While there are portfolio managers who seek to allocate funds among different sectors of the bond market to capitalize on anticipated changes in credit spreads, an analyst investigating the credit quality of an individual issue is concerned with the prospects of the credit spread increasing for that particular issue. But how does the analyst assess whether he or she believes the market will change the credit spread attributed to the issue? To understand this form of credit risk, we need to review some basic yield relationships for debt obligations.

First, the price of a bond changes in the opposite direction to the change in the yield required by the market. Thus, if yields in the bond market increase, the price of a bond declines, and vice versa. Second, the yield on a corporate debt instrument is made up of two components:

**1.** The yield on a similar maturity U.S. Treasury issue

**2.** A premium to compensate for the risks associated with the corporate debt instrument that does not exist in a Treasury issue

The risk premium is a _spread_ . In the United States, we often use the yield

- n U.S. Treasury issues as the benchmark yield because these issues are viewed as having very minimal default risk, are highly liquid, and are not callable. The part of the risk premium or spread attributable to default risk is the _credit spread_ . In a well-functioning bond market, we observe that at a given point in time the higher the credit rating, the smaller the credit
 spread

In Exhibit 8.1(B) you can see that the credit spread varies over time.

Comparing the contraction periods with Exhibit 8.1(B), you can see the increase in the spreads during economic contractions.

The price performance of a corporate bond and its return over some investment horizon depends on how the credit spread changes over time. If the credit spread increases, the market price of the bond declines. The risk that an issuer's bond will decline due to an increase in the credit spread is the credit spread risk. Changes in credit spreads affect the value of debt securities and a portfolio with debt securities, and can lead to losses for bond traders or underperformance relative to a benchmark for portfolio managers. Credit spread risk exists for an individual bond issue, bonds in a particular industry or economic sector, and for all bond issues in the economy.

The value of a bond today is the discounted value of the expected interest payments and principal repayment, where this discount rate is the bond's yield. If interest rates rise, the value of the bond falls; if interest rates fall, the value of the bond increases. Therefore, investors in bonds are interested in how sensitive a bond's value is to changes in interest rates. _Duration_ is a measure of the approximate percentage change in the value of a bond or a bond portfolio when interest rates change. A useful way of thinking of duration is that it is the approximate percentage change in the value of a bond for a 100 basis point change in “interest rates.  13 So, if the duration of a bond is 5, this means that for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the bond's price will decline by approximately 5\%.

Therefore, a bond or a portfolio of bonds is sensitive to general changes in interest rates, as well as changes in credit spreads. For example, in a recession the benchmark Treasury bond rate may not change much, but the spread relative to the Treasury bond yield is likely to increase. This is credit spread risk.

To gauge the exposure of a portfolio or an individual bond to credit spread risk requires the use of measures developed in the bond market. As we mentioned earlier, the yield on a corporate bond is the sum of the

Treasury yield and the credit spread. A measure of how a corporate bond's price is likely to change if the credit spread sought by the market changes is

_spread duration_ . For example, a spread duration of 1.7 for a corporate bond means that for a 100 basis point increase in the credit spread (holding the

Treasury yield constant), the bond's price will change by approximately

1.7\%.

### Credit Downgrade Risk

Once a credit rating is assigned to a corporate bond, a CRA monitors the credit quality of the issuer and can reassign a different credit rating. An improvement in the credit quality of an issue or issuer through a better credit rating is an _upgrade_ ; the deterioration in the credit quality of an issue

.

- r issuer through the assignment of an inferior credit rating is a _downgrade_
An unanticipated downgrading of an issue or issuer increases the credit spread sought by the market, resulting in a decline in the price of the issue
- r the issuer's debt obligation. This risk is credit downgrade risk, which is
- ften also referred to as _migration risk_ because it is the risk that the debt's credit risk will migrate to another rating class. It is obviously closely related to credit spread risk because a downgrade is one of the reasons why the credit spread will increase.
Consequently, a credit rating is not a measure of the other aspects of credit risk (that is, credit ratings do not measure credit spread risk and credit downgrade risk). Yet, investors must be aware of how CRAs gauge default risk for purposes of assigning ratings in order to understand credit downgrade risk. When assessing the credit quality of a corporate issuer, an analyst often evaluates quantitative measures such as financial ratios in terms of what the CRAs require to achieve a certain rating. When an analyst expresses a view that the credit quality has deteriorated, typically the analyst means that the analysis suggests that the issue may be downgraded because the quantitative measures identified in the analysis are inferior to the benchmarks for the issue to maintain its current credit rating.
To help gauge credit downgrade risk for corporate bonds in general, the
CRAs periodically publish data about how issues that they rated change
- ver time. These data are published in the form of a table, which is referred to as a _rating migration table_, _rating transition table_, or _transition matrix_ .
Each cell in the table shows the percentage of bonds rated by the rating agency at the beginning of the study period that had their rating change to another rating by end of period. For example, it will show the percentage of bonds rated with, say, a AA rating that had a rating of say single A at the end of the period. These tables are published for different lengths of time
- ver which rating changes are analyzed. For example, a one-year rating migration table shows the change in rating over a 12-month period.
As an example, we provide in Exhibit 8.2 a hypothetical one-year transition table that is similar to that generated by most CRAs. The rows indicate the rating at the beginning of a year. The columns show the rating at the end of the year. Look at the second row. This row shows the transition for Aa rated bonds at the beginning of a year. The number 91.40 in the second row means that on average 91.40\% of Aa rated bonds at the beginning of the year remained Aa rated at year end. The value 1.50 means that on average 1.50\% of Aa rated bonds at the beginning of the year were upgraded to Aaa. The value 0.50 means that, on average, 0.50\% of Aa rated bonds at the beginning of the year were downgraded to a Baa rating. From
Exhibit 8.2, it can be seen that the probability of a downgrade is much higher than an upgrade for investment-grade bonds. That attribute is actually observed in rating transition tables reported by CRAs.
**EXHIBIT 8.2** Hypothetical One-Year Rating Transition Table
Attempts have been made to model credit migration using the transition matrix. For example, in JPMorgan's modeling of migration, credit spreads and default probabilities are included in addition to the transition matrix to
 explain migration
Bonds migrate to different rating classes over time and the credit quality
- f an issue changes. Christopher Gootkind reports that from 1973 to 2000, the percentage of bonds that were high-quality rated went from 58\% to
25\%, and the percentage of bonds rated Baa rose from 10\% to 32\%  He
25\%, and the percentage of bonds rated Baa rose from 10\% to 32\%  He also demonstrates that there is increased credit volatility, with upgrades and
 downgrades following a cyclical pattern
## FACTORS TO CONSIDER IN CORPORATE CREDIT ANALYSIS

In conducting credit analysis, the analyst considers the four Cs of credit:

Character

Capacity

Collateral

Covenants

The first of the Cs stands for _character_  of management, the foundation of sound credit. This includes the ethical reputation as well as the business qualifications and operating record of the board of directors, management, and executives responsible for the use of the borrowed funds and repayment

- f those funds. The next C is _capacity_ or the ability of an issuer to repay its
- bligations.
The third C, _collateral_ **,** is looked at not only in the traditional sense of assets pledged to secure the debt, but also to the quality and value of those nonpledged assets controlled by the issuer. In both senses the collateral is capable of supplying additional aid, comfort, and support to the debt and the creditor. Assets form the basis for the generation of cash flow that services the debt in good times as well as bad.
The final C is for _covenants_, the terms and conditions of the lending agreement. Covenants are restrictions on how management operates the company and conducts its financial affairs. Covenants may restrict management's discretion. A default or violation of any covenant may provide a meaningful early warning alarm, enabling investors to take positive and corrective action before the situation deteriorates further.
Covenants have value as they play an important part in minimizing risk to creditors. They help prevent the unconscionable transfer of wealth from debt holders to equity holders.
### Analysis of an Issuer's Character

In 1912, the Pujo Committee, a subcommittee of the House Banking and

Currency Committee, investigated the “Money Trust monopoly.” The following is an exchange between the committee's counsel, Samuel

Untermeyer, and the well-known financier John Pierpont Morgan:

_Untermeyer_ : Is not commercial credit based primarily upon money or property?

_Morgan_ : No, sir, the first thing is character.

_Untermeyer_ : Before money or property?

_Morgan_ : Before money or anything else. Money cannot buy it … because a man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in

Christendom.

The issue of character is important, as evidenced by the financial crisis of the past few years. Investors who ignore character do so at their own peril.

The analysis of characters involves reviewing the history of the business, as well as an analysis of the experience and quality of management. In discussing the factors it considers in assigning a credit rating, Moody's

Investors Service notes the following regarding the quality of management:

_Although difficult to quantify, management quality is one of the most_

_important factors supporting an issuer's credit strength. When the_

_unexpected occurs, it is a management's ability to react appropriately_



_that will sustain the company's performance_

In assessing management quality, the rating analysts at Moody's, for example, try to understand the business strategies and policies formulated by management.

The factors that rating agencies consider in assessing management quality include:

Company goals and strategy

Risk tolerance

Internal control systems

Corporate governance

Track record

### Analysis of the Capacity to Pay

In assessing the ability of an issuer to pay, an analyst evaluates the company's financial condition and operating performance, as we discussed in earlier chapters. The goal in evaluating a company's capacity to pay is to assess whether the company's future cash flows are sufficient to satisfy the

- bligations to pay interest and repay the debt as promised. However, we should note that there are generally many factors contributing to a company's lack of capacity to pay and there is no well-specified theory of why companies fail. Therefore, assessing a company's capacity to pay is not straightforward.
### Factors to Consider

In a study of credit quality of U.S. corporate debt, Blume, Lim, and

Mackinlay examine the financial characteristics of bonds that are rated in

19 the four investment-grade categories (AAA, AA, A, and BBB)  The financial characteristics they examine are the interest coverage ratio, the

- perating margin, the long-term debt-to-assets ratio, and total debt-to-assets ratio. They found that these financial characteristics distinguish the bonds in the different rating categories. Higher quality bonds are distinguished by their lower financial risk and higher profitability. Blume, Lim, and
Mackinlay also observe that higher-quality bonds are issued by larger firms
(as measured by market capitalization), which suggests some consideration for factors beyond financial ratios (e.g., established product lines).
In addition to management quality, the factors examined by analysts at
Moody's include:
Industry trends.
Regulatory environment.
Basic operating and competitive position.
Financial position and sources of liquidity.
Company structure.
Parent company support agreements.

Special event risk
Industry trends are critical to the analysis. It is only within the context of an industry is a company analysis valid. For example, if the annual growth rate of a company is 20\%, on a stand-alone basis, that may appear attractive. However, if the industry is growing at 40\% per year, the company is competitively weak.
In considering industry trends, analysts look at a number of factors, including:
Economic cyclicality.
Degree of competition.
Degree of regulation.
Sources of supply.
Growth.
Research and development expenses.
Labor.
Accounting.

Sensitivity to changes in technology
The analyst must be sure to look at the vulnerability of the company to economic cycles, the barriers to entry, and the exposure of the company to technological changes. For firms in regulated industries, proposed changes in regulations must be analyzed to assess their impact on future cash flows.
At the company level, diversification of the product line and the cost structure are examined in assessing the basic operating position of the firm.
In addition to the measures described in previous chapters for assessing a company's financial position over the past three to five years, an analyst must look at the capacity of a firm to obtain additional financing and backup credit facilities. _Back-up credit facilities_ are additional sources of financing that may be called upon if needed. There are various forms of back-up facilities. The strongest forms of back-up credit facilities are those that are contractually binding and do not include provisions that permit the lender to refuse to provide funds. An example of such a provision is one that allows the bank to refuse funding if the bank feels that the borrower's
 financial condition or operating position has deteriorated significantly
Noncontractual facilities such as lines of credit that make it easy for a bank to refuse funding should be of concern to the analyst. The analyst must also examine the quality of the bank providing the back-up facility.
Analysts should also assess whether the company can use securitization as a funding source for generating liquidity. _Asset securitization_ involves using a pool of loans or receivables as collateral for the issuance of a security referred to as an asset-backed security. The decision of whether to securitize assets to borrow or use traditional borrowing sources is done on the basis of cost. However, if traditional sources dry up when a company faces a liquidity crisis, securitization may provide the needed liquidity. An analyst should investigate the extent to which management has considered securitization as a funding source.
Other sources of liquidity for a company may be third-party guarantees, the most common being a contractual agreement with its parent company.
When such a financial guarantee exists, the analyst must undertake a credit analysis of the parent company.
### Bankruptcy Prediction Models

Analysts and researchers use various statistical techniques to assess the potential likelihood of bankruptcy. These techniques include multiple discriminant analysis, linear probability models, and hazard models. The models that use these techniques all use financial ratios in some manner to predict whether the company is likely to fail.

For example, we can use multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) to identify those financial characteristics that distinguish companies on the basis of capacity to pay. In analyzing credit default risk, the primary advantage of using MDA is that it allows an analyst to simultaneously consider a large number of characteristics and does not restrict an analyst to a sequential evaluation of each individual attribute.

In his 1967 doctoral dissertation, Edward I. Altman established the baseline of bankruptcy prediction, using MDA to discriminate between bankrupt and nonbankrupt companies. The financial variables that have been found by Edward Altman to be important for predicting corporate bankruptcy using MDA are:

_X_ 1 Working capital to total assets

_X_ 2 Earnings retention, measured as the ratio of retained earnings to total assets

_X_ 3 Operating return on assets, which is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets

_X_ 4 Market value of equity/Total capitalization

_X_ ~~s~~ 23

5 Total asset turnover, which is net revenues divided by total asset

In his original work, published in 1968, Altman estimates the following model:

Z = 1.2 X1 + 1.4 X2 + 3.3 X3 + 0.6 X4 + 0.999 X5

The output of the MDA is a score (hence MDA is called a _credit scoring_

_model_ ) that is used to classify firms with respect to whether or not there is potentially a serious credit problem that would lead to bankruptcy. If the calculated value of _Z_ (referred to as the “ _Z_ - score”) is above 2.675, this indicates a low risk of bankruptcy; if the _Z_ - score is below 1.81, this indicates a high risk of bankruptcy and if the _Z_ - score fall between 1.81 and

2.675, it is unclear

A modification of this model to accommodate nonmanufacturers is to

 25 drop the turnover ratio and use re-estimated coefficients

Z* = 6.56 X1 + 3.26 X2 + 6.72 X3 + 1.05 X4

Applying the basic model and the variation for nonmanufacturers to actual companies, we see that Borders has _Z_ and _Z_ - scores of 0.73 and actual companies, we see that Borders has _Z_ and _Z_ - scores of 0.73 and

- 3.97, respectively, for 2010, which is the year before its filing for bankruptcy. This indicates that the company has a high risk of bankruptcy.
We can see the pattern of _Z_ and _Z_ *-scores in Exhibit 8.3(A).
*-scores in Exhibit 8.3(A).

_Source of data:_ Financial data from 10-K filings by the respective companies, various years and stock price data from Yahoo! Finance.
Circuit City, as we show in Exhibit 8.3(B), had declining _Z_  - scores, with
_Z_ *-scores that indicates a high risk of bankruptcy only in 2007. Circuit City filed for bankruptcy in November of 2008.
In 1977, Edward Altman, Robert G. Haldeman, and P. Narayanan updated
 the basic model, creating the ZETA® model This is a proprietary model, so we don't have the ability to report the details here or apply the model.
The primary modifications that the researchers made were to adapt the model to consider that large firms—that once were considered too large to fail—do, in fact, fail. Another modification was to make the model more applicable to nonmanufacturing sectors. A further modification was to update the model to consider changes in accounting. One of these changes has been the movement of more off-balance sheet debt to the balance sheet, which then changes the estimated role of each variable in the model.
The ZETA® model consists of seven variables:
Operating return on assets, which is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to total assets.
Variability of operating earnings, measured as the standard error of estimate of EBIT/Total assets (normalized) for 10 years.
Debt service, which is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest charges.
Cumulative profitability, which is measured as the ratio of retained earnings to total assets.
Liquidity, captured by the current ratio, which is the ratio of current assets to current liabilities.
Capitalization, which is the ratio of the five-year average market value
   of shareholders' equity to total capital.
Size, measured as the company's total tangible assets, normalized to reduce the effect of outliers.
The most important variable in this model is the cumulative profitability and the next-most important variable is the variability of operating earnings.
Carol Osler and Gijoon Hong report _Z_  - scores for a large sample of companies in the U. S. for the Altman model and variations to this model,
 27 _Z_                                       such as that hazard model of Tyler Shumway They observe that the scores rose, on average, over the 1995–1999 period due to the run-up in prices in the market that was fueled by Internet companies. Market value of equity is the numerator of the _X_ 4 variable and, hence, inflated stock prices affect the _Z_ - score.
Whereas credit scoring models have been found to be helpful to analysts and bond portfolio managers, they do have limitations as a replacement for human judgment in credit analysis. Marty Fridson, for example, provides the following sage advice about using MDA models:
_[Q]uantitative models tend to classify as troubled credits not only most of_
_the companies that eventually default, but also many that do not default._
_Often, firms that fall into financial peril bring in new management and_
_are revitalized without ever failing in their debt service. If faced with a_
_huge capital loss on the bonds of a financially distressed company, an_
_institutional investor might wish to assess the probability of a turnaround_
_—an inherently difficult-to-quantify prospect—instead of selling purely_

_on the basis of a default model_
Fridson also notes that one must recognize that “companies can default for reasons that a model based on reported financial cannot pick up.”
In addition to MDA, there are several other statistical techniques that can be used in predicting bankruptcy. Several of these fall into the class of multiple regression models: linear probability model, probit regression model, and logit regression model. In all of these models applied to predicting default, the dependent variable is “default” or “nondefault.  29
A linear probability model is the simplest type; however, a major drawback of the model is that the predicted value may be negative. Probit regression model is a nonlinear regression model where predicted values
(the probabilities) fall between 0 and 1 because what is being predicted is based on the standard normal cumulative probability distribution. As with the probit regression model, the logit regression model is a nonlinear regression model and the predicted value is also based on a cumulative probability distribution. However, rather than being a standard normal cumulative probability distribution, it is a standard cumulative probability distribution of a distribution called the logistic distribution.
Another related technique that can be used is a _hazard model_ . A hazard model is similar to the regression models, but each company's life span as a healthy company enters into the estimation. An example of this is the model by Tyler Shumway. Using Altman's five-variable _Z_ - score model but estimating the model using a hazard function, he finds that operating return
- n assets and capitalization are the most discriminating of the variables.
### Analysis of the Collatera l

A corporate debt obligation may be secured or unsecured. As explained earlier, in the case of the liquidation of the company, the proceeds from a

.

bankruptcy are distributed to creditors based on the _absolute priority rule_

This rule states that senior creditors are paid before junior creditors, and that all creditors are paid before owners receive anything. However, in the

31 case of reorganization, the absolute priority rule rarely holds  That is, unsecured creditors may receive distributions for the entire amount of their claim and common stockholders may receive something, while secured creditors may receive only a portion of their claim. The reason is that reorganization requires approval of all the parties. Consequently, secured creditors are willing to negotiate with both unsecured creditors and stockholders in order to obtain approval of the plan of reorganization.

The question is then, what does a secured position mean in the case of reorganization if the absolute priority rule is not followed in reorganization?

The claim position of a secured creditor is important in terms of the negotiation process. However, because absolute priority is not followed and the final distribution in reorganization depends on the bargaining ability of the parties, some analysts place less emphasis on collateral compared to the

- ther factors discussed earlier and covenants discussed later.
The types of collateral used for a corporate bond issue are broadly classified as mortgage debt and other secured debt. _Mortgage debt_ is debt secured by real property such as plant and equipment. The largest issuers of mortgage debt are electric utility companies. There are instances when a company might have two or more layers of mortgage debt outstanding with
 different priorities
Debt may be secured by many different assets. Collateral trust bonds and notes are secured by pledges of financial assets such as cash, receivables,
- ther notes, debentures or bonds, and not by real property. Generally, the market value of the collateral must be at least some minimum percentage of the bonds or notes outstanding.
Railroads and airlines have financed much of their rolling stock and aircraft with secured debt. The securities go by various names such as
_equipment trust certificates_ (ETCs) in the case of railroads, and _secured_
_equipment certificates_, _guaranteed loan certificates_, and _loan certificates_ in the case of airlines. If a railroad, for example, buys a piece of equipment, the title to that equipment is transferred to a trustee, who, in turn, leases the equipment to the railroad and sells the trust certificates to investors.
### Analysis of Covenants

Covenants are pledges or commitments that limit and restrict a borrower's activities. Some covenants are common to all indentures, such as to:

Pay interest, principal, and premium, if any, on a timely basis.

Maintain an office or agency where the securities may be transferred or exchanged and where notices may be served upon the company with respect to the securities and the indenture.

Pay all taxes and other claims when due unless contested in good faith.

Maintain all properties used and useful in the borrower's business in good condition and working order.

Maintain adequate insurance on its properties.

Submit periodic certificates to the trustee stating whether the debtor is in compliance with the loan agreement.

Maintain its corporate existence.

The covenants listed above are _affirmative covenants_ because they call upon the debtor to make promises to do certain things.

In contrast to affirmative covenants, _negative covenants_ are those which require the borrower not to take certain actions. There is an infinite variety

- f restrictions that can be placed on borrowers, depending on the type of debt issue, the economics of the industry and the nature of the business, and the lenders' desires. Some of the more common restrictive covenants include various limitations on the company's ability to incur debt because unrestricted borrowing can lead a company and its bondholders to ruin.
Thus, debt restrictions may include limits on the absolute dollar amount of debt that may be outstanding or may require a ratio test; for example, debt may be limited to no more than 60\% of total capitalization or that it cannot exceed a certain percentage of net tangible assets.
There may be an interest or fixed charge coverage test of which there are two types. One, a _maintenance test_, requires the borrower's ratio of earnings available for interest or fixed charges to be at least a certain minimum certain preceding period. The other type, a _debt incurrence test_, only comes adjusted for the new debt, to be at least two times for the required period prior to the financing. Debt incurrence tests are generally considered less stringent than maintenance provisions. There could also be cash flow tests
figure on each required reporting date (such as quarterly or annually) for a into play when the company wishes to do additional borrowing. For example, a debt incurrence test may require an interest coverage figure,
- r requirements and working capital maintenance provisions.
Some indentures may prohibit subsidiaries from borrowing from all other companies except the parent. Indentures often classify subsidiaries as restricted or unrestricted. Restricted subsidiaries are those considered to be consolidated for financial test purposes; unrestricted subsidiaries (often foreign and certain special-purpose companies) are those excluded from the covenants governing the parent. Often, subsidiaries are classified as unrestricted in order to allow them to finance themselves through outside
sources of funds.
Limitations on dividend payments and stock repurchases may be included in indentures. Often, cash dividend payments will be limited to a certain percentage of net income earned after a specific date plus a fixed amount.
Sometimes the dividend formula might allow the inclusion of the net proceeds from the sale of common stock sold after the peg date. In other cases, the dividend restriction might be so worded as to prohibit the declaration and payment of cash dividends if tangible net worth (or other measures, such as consolidated quick assets) declines below a certain amount. There are usually no restrictions on the payment of stock dividends. In addition to dividend restrictions, there are often restrictions on a company's repurchase of its common stock if such a purchase might cause a violation or deficiency in the dividend determination formulae. Some holding company indentures might limit the right of the company to pay dividends in the common stock of its subsidiaries.
Another part of the covenant article may place restrictions on the disposition and the sale and leaseback of certain property. In some cases, the proceeds of asset sales totaling more than a certain amount must be used to repay debt. This is seldom found in indentures for unsecured debt but at times some investors may have wished they had such a protective clause. At
- ther times, a provision of this type might allow a company to retire high coupon debt in a lower interest rate environment, thus causing bondholders a loss of value. It might be better to have such a provision where the company would have the right to reinvest the proceeds of asset sales in new plant and equipment rather than retiring debt, or to at least give the investor the option of tendering his bonds.
## SUMMARY

Credit analysis of a corporation involves the analysis of a multitude of quantitative and qualitative factors over the past, present, and future based

- n the issuer's, and, if applicable, the guarantor's, operations and need for funds. In conducting a credit examination, an analyst must consider the four
Cs of credit—character, capacity, collateral, and covenants.
Character analysis involves the analysis of the quality of management, including trying to understand the business strategies and policies formulated by management.
Assessing the capacity of an issuer to pay involves an analysis of the financial statements, including the analysis of industry trends (i.e., vulnerability of the company to economic cycles, the barriers to entry, and the exposure of the company to technological changes), the regulatory environment, basic operating and competitive position, financial position and sources of liquidity, company structure, parent company support agreements (if any), and special event risk.
Statistical models have been used that, based on financial data, seek to predict corporate bankruptcy (multiple discriminant analysis) or the probability of bankruptcy (linear probability model, probit regression model, and logit regression model).
Analysis of collateral involves an analysis of the claim position of the bondholder. In the liquidation of a corporation, proceeds are distributed to creditors based on the principle of absolute priority while in a reorganization absolute priority rarely holds because reorganization requires approval of all the parties. The claim position of a secured creditor is important in terms of strength in the negotiation process in reorganization.
Covenants deal with limitations and restrictions on the borrower's activities. Affirmative covenants call upon the debtor to make promises to do certain things (e.g., make timely payments of interest and repayment of principal). Negative covenants are those which require the borrower not to take certain actions.

# CHAPTER 9 Analysis of Equity Risk Using Fundamentals Factor Models

Throughout this book, we have described various measures computed from financial statements and ratios that have combined financial statement data and market data. We discussed how these measures can be used to evaluate the economic prospects of a company. In Chapter 5, we began the process

- f showing how a company's stock can be valued using a discounted value approach and we presented several dividend discount models that are used by practitioners. In this chapter, we look at another approach to valuation, factor models. While there are different types of factor models, our focus in this chapter is on _fundamental factor models,_ which use the various measures discussed in this book as inputs to the model.
Our objective is not to discuss how factor models are built. Rather, our
- bjective is simply to demonstrate how various measures are used in models to estimate the expected return on stocks and to manage portfolios.
## MEASURING RISK

It is well known that there is a positive relationship between risk and expected return. That is, the greater the risk, the higher the expected return that investors want. This is a basic principle of financial theory. The tough part is figuring out the appropriate way to define risk and to how to quantify that risk.

The term “risk” is used very casually in the financial press and in day-today conversations about investments. Financial theory provides a more specific definition of risk. There are several models in financial theory that define risk quantitatively and relate that risk to the expected return. We refer to these models as .

_asset pricing models_

### Total Risk

The first major step in the development of asset pricing models was to show how to think about and quantify risk in general. Harry Markowitz explained that the risk of an individual stock should be quantified by using the

 standard deviation or variance of possible returns

Specifically, we can measure risk by the standard deviation or variance of the stock's anticipated returns. This measure of risk is referred to as _total_

_risk_ and we will see why it bears this label shortly. Thus, according to financial theory, the total risk that an investor faces from investing in a stock is the standard deviation or variance of a stock's return.

Consider a simple example. Suppose a stock has the following possible returns, with a probability (or likelihood) associated with each one:

|Scenario|Probability|PossibleReturn|
|---|---|---|
|Boom market|30\%|15\%|
|Normal market|50\%|8\%|
|Bust market|20\%|−2\%|

The expected return is the weighted average of the possible returns, where each return is weighted by its probability of occurrence. The expected return is 8.1\%. The more challenging part of the calculations is to determine the variance and standard deviation of this distribution. Like a standard deviation for a sample, we consider that each possible return deviates from the expected return. The next step is to weight these squared deviations by the probabilities; the sum of the weighted squared deviations is the variance. The square root of the variance is the standard deviation of the possible returns. We provide the general steps in this calculation in Exhibit

9.1 Exhibit 9.2.

and detail these calculations for our example in

EXHIBIT 9.1 Process for Calculating a Standard Deviation of Possible

Returns

**EXHIBIT 9.2** Calculation of the Expected Return and Standard Deviation of Returns

The calculation of the standard deviation of the possible returns, though helpful in understanding how investors may use expectations in pricing, is not realistic of what investors or analysts actually do. A more practical approach to estimating a standard deviation is calculating historical returns and using the distribution of these returns as an estimate of the standard deviation of future returns. Of course, when using this approach we are assuming that the variability of stock prices in the past is representative of the volatility of stock prices in the future.

Consider the returns of Apple, Inc. Using sample statistics, we can

2 calculate the mean monthly return and the standard deviation  We start with month-end stock prices and then calculate each month's returns. Because the mean and standard deviation will be different for different periods, the investor or analyst must apply judgment and care in forecasting the mean and dis ersion of returns based on historical returns: p

|Period|Mean|StandardDeviation|
|---|---|---|
|1987-2011|2.50\%|13.90\%|
|1992-2011|2.44\%|13.92\%|
|2002-2011|3.67\%|11.05\%|
|2007-2011|3.23\%|10.67\%|

The standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of the possible returns: the greater the dispersion, the greater the risk. Therefore, the larger the standard deviation of an asset's returns, the greater the asset's total risk.

Markowitz shows that the total risk of a portfolio of stocks is _not_ found by simply adding up the total risk of the individual stocks included in the portfolio. Rather, the total risk of a portfolio, as measured by the variance of the portfolio's return, depends on the correlation (or covariance) between each pair of assets in the portfolio.

A key element of Markowitz's demonstration is that the lower the correlation, the lower the total risk of the portfolio. The procedure for diversification is then to combine stocks in a portfolio, giving recognition to the correlation between assets.

Markowitz then went on to show how an efficient portfolio can be created. An _efficient portfolio_ is a portfolio where for a given level of expected return, the portfolio's total risk will be the smallest of all possible portfolios that can be created.

### Systematic Risks and Unsystematic Risk

Subsequent analysis of risk developed two principles. The first is that in a reasonably efficient stock market, investors are only rewarded for accepting risks that cannot be diversified away by an investor. The second principle is that total risk, as measured by the variance of an asset's return, can be decomposed into two general categories of risk—risks that can be diversified away and risk that cannot be diversified away.

We refer to the risks that an investor cannot diversify away as

- r
_nondiversifiable risk_ _systematic risk_ . We refer to any remaining risk as
- r _residual risk_
_unsystematic risk_ . We diagram this decomposition in
Exhibit 9.3.
Investors should be compensated for the systematic risks but not for unsystematic risk.
EXHIBIT 9.3 Risk Composition
## ASSET PRICING MODEL

There are asset pricing models in financial theory that define risk quantitatively and relate that risk to the expected return.

Key to these models is identifying systematic risks. We refer to such risks as

_factors or risk factors._ Asset pricing models show the relationship between the expected return for an asset and risk factors. The two dominant asset pricing models are the capital asset pricing model and the arbitrage pricing theory model.

### Capital Asset Pricing Model

Let's look at a popular asset pricing model, the capital asset pricing model

(CAPM). Based on certain assumptions, CAPM says that there is only one form of systematic risk. This systematic risk is the movement of the market in general. Mathematically, we can express the return based on the CAPM as the sum of the risk-free rate of return, _Rf_, and the premium for bearing market risk, _βi_ [E( _Rm_ - _Rf_ )]: where _Rm_ is the expected return on the market index.

β _i_ is the measure of systematic risk for asset _i_ .

In theory, the market is defined as all assets. However, in practice, in the application of the CAPM to stocks, the market is defined as a broad-based equity market index such as the Standard & Poor's 500.

The β _i_ is the stock's beta. Mathematically, it is the ratio of the covariance

- f the stock's return with the market to the total risk (variance) of the market. It is a measure of systematic risk because it quantifies how the stock's return systematically varies with the market's return. The CAPM asserts that the expected (or required) return on an individual asset is a positive, linear function of its index of systematic risk as measured by beta.
The higher the beta, the higher the expected return. Notice that it is only an asset's beta that determines its expected return—which is what we noted earlier that the CAPM assumes only one form of systematic risk.
There are two approaches used to estimate beta. The first is to use a time series of monthly or weekly returns to estimate the following relationship between the return on the stock and the return on the market: where _Ri_ is the observed return for period _t_ for stock _i_ .
_Rmt_ is the observed return on the market index for period _t_ .
_Bi_ is the slope for stock _i_ which we refer to as the historical beta.
This regression equation that we use to obtain the estimate for beta for the
CAPM is the _market model_ . The intercept (α) and slope (β) are the parameters to be estimated and the latter is the estimate used for the beta of stock _i_ in the CAPM.
The problem with using historical beta is that beta captures fundamental attributes of a company such as leverage, size, earnings growth, and liquidity, and these attributes change over time. What is important is that the analyst use the _future_ beta in estimating the expected return when employing the CAPM. Because company attributes change, historical beta may not be a good predictor of future beta.
This problem leads to the second approach to estimating beta. The approach involves first calculating historical beta for all firms using the market model. Suppose there are _N_ firms and therefore _N_ estimated betas denoted by _i_ . Then suppose that there are _k_ fundamental attributes that have been found to affect the beta of firms. We will denote these attributes at a given point in time as _X_ . Then we estimate the following cross-sectional multiple regression: where the _α_ ‘s are the parameters to be estimated and the _Xk,i_ is the observed fundamental attribute _k_ for firm _i_ .3
Given the estimates for the parameters, we estimate a company's beta by substituting its fundamental attributes into the previous equation. The
 resulting estimated beta is a _fundamental beta_
The assumption in using this procedure is that for all companies the fundamental beta is affected in the same way for each fundamental attribute. For example, it assumes that an increase in the leverage ratio by a certain amount affects the fundamental beta of Microsoft in the same way it affects Kmart.
Consider an application of this to the analysis of a single company.
Suppose we have the estimates for the coefficients in the fundamental beta equation. If the company we are analyzing is acquiring another company and its liquidity returns, leverage, and other fundamental factors are expected to change, the analyst can use this equation and the estimated coefficients to estimate the company's new beta.
The research into the fundamental factors of beta indicates that operating
 leverage and financial leverage are drivers of a company's systematic risk
In addition, researchers have found that companies in industries that are
 more cyclical have higher betas In their analysis of the drivers of betas of
 more cyclical have higher betas In their analysis of the drivers of betas of value and growth stocks, John Campbell, Christopher Polk and Tupmo
Vuolteenaho find that betas are driven, in large part, by the cash flow
 characteristics of the companies
### Arbitrage Pricing Theory Model

In 1976, Stephen Ross developed an alternative equilibrium asset pricing model He derived this model based purely on arbitrage arguments, and hence he called it the  8

_arbitrage pricing theory_ (APT) model In its simplest form, arbitrage is the simultaneous buying and selling of a security at two different prices in two different markets. The arbitrageur profits without risk by buying cheap in one market and simultaneously selling at the higher price in the other market.

In the APT model there may be more than one systematic risk, whereas the CAPM asserts that there is only one systematic risk. Further, unlike the

CAPM, the APT model does not specify the identity of the factors—just that they may exist.

Using the APT model, we can specify the return on asset _i_ in terms of the returns on the risk-free rate of interest and the returns on the excess returns associated with the _K_ factors: where _β_ i, _Fj_ is the sensitivity of asset _i_ to the _j-th_ factor, and

[E( _RFj_ ) – _Rf_ ] is the excess return of the _j_    - _th_ sensitivity factor over the risk-free rate.

We can think of the excess return as being the risk premium associated with the _j-th_ systematic risk.

The APT model states that investors want to be compensated for all the factors that _systematically_ affect the return of a stock. The compensation is the sum of the products of the each factor's systematic risk ( _βi_, _Fh_ ), and the risk premium assigned to it by the market [ _E_ ( _RFh_ - _RF_ )]. As in the case of the

CAPM, an investor is not compensated for accepting unsystematic risk.

Examining the APT and CAPM, we can see that if the only factor in the

APT is market risk, the APT model reduces to the CAPM.

Supporters of the APT model argue that it has several major advantages

- ver the CAPM. First, it makes less restrictive assumptions about investor preferences toward risk and return. Second, no assumptions are made about the distribution of security returns.
## FACTOR MODELS

CAPM and APT are equilibrium models that tell us the relationship between risk and expected return. In practice, there are three types of factor models that seek to identify a parsimonious set of factors that explain stock returns: statistical factor models, macroeconomic factor models, and fundamental factor models. We briefly describe the first two models below and then provide more detail on the model of principal interest to us, fundamental factor models. The key in the application of factor models to equity valuation is identifying the risk factors.

In a _statistical factor model,_ historical and cross-sectional data on stock returns are tossed into a statistical model. Using a statistical technique,

_principal components analysis_, “factors” are derived that best explain the variance of the observed stock returns. For example, suppose you start with the monthly returns for 3,000 companies for 10 years. The goal of principal components analysis is to produce “factors” that best explain the observed stock returns. Let's suppose that there are six “factors” that do this. These

“factors” are statistical artifacts and referred to as latent factors. The

- bjective in a statistical factor model is to determine the economic meaning
- f each of these statistically derived factors.
Because of the problem of interpretation, it is difficult to use the factors from a statistical factor model for valuation and risk control. Instead, practitioners prefer the two other models that allow them to pre-specify meaningful factors, and thus produce a more intuitive model. In a
_macroeconomic factor model_, the inputs to the model are historical stock returns and observable macroeconomic variables. These variables are _raw_
_descriptors_ or simply _descriptors_ . The goal is to determine the macroeconomic variables that are pervasive in explaining historical stock returns; those variables are the factors and we include them in the model.
We estimate the responsiveness of a stock's return to these factors using historical time series data.
## FUNDAMENTAL FACTOR MODELS

Fundamental factor models use company and industry attributes and market data as the basic inputs to the model. Examples of the basic inputs are price/earnings ratios, book/price ratios, earnings momentum, and financial burden measures. The fundamental factor model uses stock returns and the basic inputs about a company and tries to identify which basic inputs are important in explaining stock returns. Those basic inputs about a company that are found to be important in explaining stock returns comprise a fundamental factor model. In practice, an investor can either develop a fundamental factor model or purchase one from a commercial vendor.

Commercial vendors of fundamental factor models include:

MSCI Barra

Axioma

APT

Northfield

RSquared

We discuss the MSCI Barra fundamental factor model next and then describe a popular model developed by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, referred to as the three-factor model.

### MSCI Barra Fundamental Factor Model

In the MSCI Barra fundamental factor model, there are eight risk indexes that are specific to the stock:

**1.** Momentum

**2.** Volatility

**3.** Size

**4.** Value

**5.** Growth

**6.** Size nonlinearity

**7.** Liquidity

**8.** ~~e~~ 9

Financial leverag

We provide definitions of the risk indices and related descriptors in

Exhibit 9.4. Three of the risk indexes include at least one of the measures of earnings, earnings forecast, or price-to-earnings ratio—the growth risk index, the earnings yield risk index, and the earnings variability risk index.

The growth index and the dividend yield risk index have raw descriptors using one of the dividend measures.

**EXHIBIT 9.4** Sample Fundamental Data Used in MSCI Barra Models

These risk factors are obtained from data from both a firm's financial statements and equity market information. In Exhibit 9.5 we show sample fundamental data used in the model. As you can see in this exhibit, several

- f these descriptors are financial ratios that we have discussed in Chapter 4 as well as other measures taken or constructed from the financial statements.

### Fama-French Three-Factor Model

Now let's look at the factor models suggested by Eugene Fama and Kenneth

French in their 1992 and 1993 studies  10

They examine the relationship between stock returns, beta, and several fundamental factors, including the earnings-price ratio, leverage, size, and book-to-market value of equity.

They observe that, in addition to the market index, stock returns can be explained by size (that is, market capitalization) and the book-to-market equity ratio. For example, in their three-factor model, Fama and French present factors that are comparisons of returns:

|SMB:<br>Small<br>minusbig|Averagereturnforthethreesmallestportfolios lesstheaveragereturnonthethree<br>,<br>largestportfolios<br>.|
|---|---|
|HML:<br>High<br>minus<br>low|Average return on the two value portfolios (that is, stocks with high book-to-market<br>ratios), less the average return on the two growth portfolios (that is, stocks with low<br>book-to-market ratios).|
|_RM_ –_Rf_|Return on the market, less the return on a risk-free security|

In general, smaller capitalization firms have greater returns than larger capitalization firms. Further, firms with high book-to-market ratios have higher returns than firms with lower book-to-market ratios. Notice that the market index is still a factor in the Fama-French model. The difference between their model and the CAPM (an equilibrium model) is due to the presence of the book-to-market and capitalization in their model.

### Applications of Fundamental Factor Models

The output of a fundamental factor model is the expected return for a stock after adjusting for all of the risk factors. This return is the _expected excess_

_return._ From the expected excess return for each stock, we can compute an expected excess return for a portfolio comprised of stocks. This is the weighted average of the expected excess return for each stock in the portfolio. The weights are the percentage of a stock's value in the portfolio relative to the market value of the portfolio. Similarly, a portfolio's sensitivity to a given factor risk is a weighted average of the factor sensitivity of the stocks in the portfolio.

.

The set of factor sensitivities is then the portfolio's _risk exposure profile_

Consequently, the expected excess return and the risk exposure profile can be obtained from the stocks comprising the portfolio. Since a stock market index or benchmark is nothing more than a portfolio that includes the universe of stocks making up the index, an expected excess return and risk exposure profile can be determined for an index. This allows a manager to compare the expected excess return and the risk profile of a stock and/or a portfolio to that of a market index whose performance the portfolio manager is measured against.

Portfolios can be constructed by managers so as to have the desired exposure to fundamental factors and, hence, risk. To understand what this means, it is necessary to understand what the manager is attempting to do.

A client specifies a benchmark for a manager. The goal of the manager is to

- utperform the benchmark. A common benchmark is the S&P 500. The benchmark has the risk exposures as defined by the fundamental factor model. The distinction between active portfolio management and passive portfolio management is that the latter tries to match the performance of the benchmark while the former seeks to outperform the benchmark.
In terms of fundamental factor models, a portfolio manager who follows a passive strategy known as indexing will seek to construct a portfolio to match the factor exposures of the benchmark. Of course, the manager can do this by buying all the stocks in the benchmark. Alternatively, the manager can use an optimization program to construct a portfolio whose exposure to the factors is such that the portfolio constructed has minimal risk of not matching the performance of the benchmark. That is, the constructed portfolio has minimal “tracking error.”
Active portfolio management requires that the manager make active bets.
In terms of fundamental factor models, the bets are in the form of departures of the constructed portfolios exposure to the factors from the exposure of the factors in the benchmark.
## SUMMARY

We can measure the total risk of a stock by the variance or standard deviation of the stock's return. The risk of a portfolio, however, depends on the correlation of returns of the stocks in the portfolio.

We can divide the total risk of a stock into systematic risk and unsystematic risk. Investors should be rewarded, in terms of a higher return,

- nly for accepting systematic risks.
An asset pricing model shows the relationship between the systematic risks and expected return. The key is to determine the systematic risks. The capital asset pricing model asserts that there is only one systematic risk, whereas the arbitrage pricing model allows for more than one systematic risk.
Factor models assume that there may be more than one systematic risk.
There are three types of factor models: statistical factor models, macroeconomic factor models, and fundamental factor models. The factors in a statistical factor model are statistical artifacts and are therefore difficult to interpret, and such models are rarely used by practitioners. The more common factor models are the macroeconomic factor model and the fundamental factor model. The raw descriptors in a macroeconomic factor model are macroeconomic variables; in a fundamental factor model the raw descriptors are fundamental variables for a company. In a factor model, the sensitivity of a stock's return to a factor is estimated.
The risk exposure profile of a stock is identified by the set of factor sensitivities. The risk exposure profile of a portfolio is the weighted average
- f the risk exposure profile of the stocks in the portfolio. The power of a factor model is that given the risk factors and the factor sensitivities, a portfolio's risk exposure profile can be quantified and controlled.

# CHAPTER 10 The Lessons We Learn

Financial analysis involves gathering the information about a company, its industry, and the economy, and developing an evaluation of the company's future financial condition and operating performance. The financial scandals and crises since the 1990s have increased the awareness of the need for more transparency in financial disclosures and better analysis of the available information.

Former Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),

Harvey Pitt, summed up this era in his testimony before the Committee on

Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives (March 20, 2002):

_In recent years, corporate leaders have been under increasing pressure_

_from the investment community, including individual investors, to meet_

_elevated expectations. They also have been operating under a system that_

_can misalign the incentives of investors and those of management. Our_

_culture over the past decade has fostered a short-term perspective of_

_corporate performance. Corporate leaders and directors have been_

_rewarded for short-term performance, sometimes at the expense of long-_

_term fundamental value. Investors have purchased stock not because they_

_believed in the business or its strategy as an investment over the long-_

_term, but simply under the assumption that stock prices would only go_

_up._ 1

As a result of these problems, we have seen many new laws and regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) and the

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.

Another recent impetus for the need for disclosure and transparency is the financial crisis of 2007–2008. There was a rule change for accounting that required firms to report assets using mark-to-market accounting for fiscal

2 years beginning after November 15, 2007  The financial crisis of 2007–

2008 was not caused by this rule change, but the rule change did lay bare the risks that some financial institutions had taken on. The Report of the

Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission states as follows:

_As market prices dropped, “mark-to-market” accounting rules required_

_firms to write down their holdings to reflect the lower market prices. In_

_the first quarter of 2007, the largest banks and investment banks began_

_complying with a new accounting rule and for the first time reported_

_their assets in one of three valuation categories: “Level 1 assets,” which_

_had observable market prices, like stocks on the stock exchange; “Level_

_2 assets,” which were not as easily priced because they were not actively_

_traded; and “Level 3 assets,” which were illiquid and had no discernible_

.

_market prices or other inputs_

The financial institutions, such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, had this risk exposure, but it was the accounting rule change that exposed the extent of some firms' investment in risky assets whose value had fallen. As pointed out in the Report, some firms had Level 3 assets—those that were very risky and whose value had fallen substantially—exceeding their equity capital. Though there is still debate as to whether mark-to-market accounting is appropriate because it creates volatility in earnings and, for financial institutions, creates a need for more equity capital even for losses that are not yet recognized, the fact is that these assets were owned by these firms and the reported values prior to the accounting rule change may have been overvalued.

Our focus in this book has been on fundamental value. Key to a company's fundamental value is its future financial condition and operating performance. In our analysis of a company, however, we rely upon information supplied by others; in particular, the company's own financial disclosures.

One of the buzz words of recent years is transparency. _Transparency_ in financial reporting means that companies provide information to owners and other stakeholders in an understandable manner. This requires that financial disclosures be clear, reliable, and comparable. Transparency is important in financial disclosures to insure the ability of stakeholders to evaluate the financial condition and performance of companies.

Transparency is viewed as important for the efficient functioning of financial markets  4

We have focused on the interpretation of required financial disclosures that companies make, as prescribed by regulatory requirements. But in addition to the wealth of information available through these disclosures, many companies choose to disclose information above and beyond these required disclosures. In its Business Reporting Research Project, the

Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) analyzed voluntary disclosures of companies. The FASB classified these disclosures into six categories:

**1.** Business data about the company's sales, products, and financial performance.

**2.** Management analysis of business data, including goals, trends, impact of strikes, and benchmarking against competitors.

**3.** Forward-looking information about products and operations, including patent expirations, growth targets for products or regions, and expected growth.

**4.** Information about management and shareholders.

**5.** Background about the company, including a discussion of key legislation, industry trends, facilities, and strategies.

**6.** Information about intangible assets, such as information about research and development, customer relations, and innovations.

These voluntary disclosures should be used to supplement the required disclosures because they provide management's perspective of what drives the company's financial results.

In a perfect world, the system of financial disclosure would provide information that is:

_Relevant_ to the determination of fundamental value.

_Reflective_   of the true economics of the transactions.

_Verifiable_, such that estimates and assumptions are reasonable and are understood.

_Neutral_ with respect to any predetermined result, such as analysts' forecasts.

_Comparable_, enabling the analyst to compare information among companies and over time.

_Complete_, providing sufficient information to understand a company's past, current, and future performance.

_Understandable_ to all stakeholders.

But, of course, we do not live in a perfect world. The improvements in financial disclosures and the audit function, as well as enhanced penalties for misdeeds, will result in better quality financial disclosures. The financial analyst must, however, still be diligent in looking at this information critically. One of the signs of an increasing awareness and importance of the accuracy of financial statement has been the increased number of companies restating their financial disclosures for “accounting irregularities.” Restatements occur when companies correct errors in previously reported financial statement information, with revenue recognition being the most frequent basis for restatements.

In a study of restatements, the General Accounting Office (GAO)

5 reported the frequency of restatements, as well as the reasons  The GAO notes, based on data through 2006, that:

The percentage of large companies reporting restatements grew at a higher rate than small companies.

The greatest source of restatements was with respect to revenues, with costs and expenses following in second.

Mark Cheffers, Don Whalen, and Olga Usvyatsky examine the number of and trends in restatements. They surmise that the increase in restatements after 2002 coincides with the awareness of the importance of disclosures

 and the enforcement mechanisms provided by the SOX Act They observe that restatements increased significantly in 2005 and 2006, but then declined from 2007 through 2009. For example, the number of unique corporations restating in 2006 was almost 1,600, but in 2010 this number was just under 700.

In terms of who is initiating the restatements, the company itself is the most frequent initiator. What this tells us is that companies are aware of the increased scrutiny of financial disclosures and they are taking measures to insure that their disclosures are accurate  7

The federal government has continued to try to maintain the integrity of financial statements through other legislation since the passage of SOX in

2002. For example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer

Protection Act of 2010 requires the following for every public company:

Disclose incentive-based compensation based on financial information required to be reported.

Adopt a corporate policy so that in the event of a financial restatement, the company will recoup from current and former executives any incentive-based compensation, for the three years preceding the restatement, that would not have been awarded under the restated financial statements.

Failure to adopt a corporate policy for dealing with recouping compensation based on restatements would result in the delisting of a company. This recoupment is referred to as “clawback” provision. Although a clawback provision was included in SOX, the Dodd-Frank Act goes well beyond what SOX required. Under SOX, the clawback provision is only triggered if the restatement is the result of misconduct by the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer and allows only recouping of those amounts received in the year following the first improper filing. The

Dodd-Frank Act, instead, effectively imposes strict liability. That is, should a company restate for any reason, then it is mandatory for the company to recover from current and former executive officers any excess incentivebased compensation awarded in the prior three years.

## THE LESSONS

Throughout this book, we have offered tools and techniques that the analyst may apply in performing financial analysis. We've also pointed out some of the things that analysts missed along the way, which were eventually brought to light in the financial scandals since the 1990s. From all of this, you should take along with you a number of lessons regarding financial analysis.

### Lesson 1: Understand What You Are Looking at

The analyst must be aware of the type of disclosure that he or she is looking at. Is this a disclosure that is prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), or is this pro forma or adjusted information?

If the disclosure is earnings, specifically what earnings are these? Are they before or after the effects of an accounting change? Are they before or after the effects of discontinued items? Are they before or after extraordinary items? Are they before or after special items? The analyst must have a thorough understanding of accounting principles, as well as an understanding of the source of the information.

Consider the issue of a company's earnings. Within generally accepted accounting principles, the company's management has some discretion with regard to how it classifies some income and expenses on the income statement. Researchers have observed that investors give less weight to

8 transitory items on the income statement than to permanent items  With that in mind, we can see why companies have wanted to separate transitory from permanent items. But this introduces an element of confusion because there are now many earnings figures to sort through. For example, a company may report:

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization

(EBITDA).

Operating income.

Income before income taxes.

Income from continuing operations.

Income before extraordinary items.

Income before effect of changes in accounting principles.

Net income.

In addition, companies may develop their own measures that they present alongside the GAAP figures. Consider Duff & Phelps Corporation, which is a financial services company. For 2010, it reported income as follows:

_Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income was \$29.7 million, or \$0.77 per share_

_on a fully exchanged, fully diluted basis, compared to 32.7 million, or_

_0.88 per share, for the corresponding prior year. Adjusted Pro Forma_

_Net Income per fully-exchanged share excludes a 0.05 per charge_

_related to the departure of our former president and one of our segment_

_leaders_

You might get the impression that the \$0.77 per share is the diluted earnings per share for 2010 after adjusting for the \$0.05 charge related to the executives; hence, actual diluted earnings per share should be 0.72.

But that is not the case: Actual diluted EPS were 0.60. So what are these adjustments? In this case, the adjustments include:

Merger and acquisition costs.

Realignment charge.

Equity-based compensation.

An adjustment in the provision for income taxes.

We compare the adjusted and the GAAP figures for 2008–2010 in Exhibit

10.1 for Duff & Phelps to give you an idea of the extent of the adjustments.

Why the different financial pictures? It is the terminology: The company's introduction of the term “adjusted pro forma” muddies the waters. The definition provided in the footnote to the company's press release indicates that this is income adjusted for special items and the tax on the special items, plus equity-based compensation.

**EXHIBIT 10.1** Duff & Phelps' Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income

So what earnings should the analyst use in the analysis of Duff & Phelps?

It should probably be a number somewhere between the GAAP and the adjusted pro forma figures. The analyst must delve into the footnotes and explanations of the extraordinary gains and losses, the special items, and discontinued items to determine how much, if any, of these items are likely to recur in the future.

### Lesson 2: Read the Fine Print

The information that companies provide in their balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows is informative, but there is so much more that we can learn from footnotes, the management discussion and analysis, and other disclosures.

The trend in regulation and accounting pertaining to financial reporting is requiring companies to disclose more information in the management discussion and analysis and footnotes. In fact, these items should be the starting place in the examination of financial statements—understanding what is behind the numbers that appear in the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. The challenge is that footnotes may be neither concise nor clear. Companies are required to provide these footnotes, but there is no standard for the format or readability. For example, the convoluted nature of the special purposes entities of Enron

Corporation was evident in the company's own footnotes and the publicly available filings of the special purpose entities. Though it may not have been possible to unravel all the financial threads in this case, there was enough to raise questions.

Many of the companies involved in financial scandals in the past provided information that should have been a red flag (or at least a caution flag) regarding the management of earnings. Consider the case of Waste

Management, formerly known as USA Waste. Waste Management used many different devices, including extending depreciable lives and altering salvage values on depreciable assets, to meet analysts' earnings expectations. Hints of this were offered in its footnotes. For example, in a footnote in its 1995 10-K filing, Waste Management disclosed the following:

_In 1995, depreciation and amortization decreased due to the change in_

_the estimated useful life of excess cost over net assets of acquired_

_businesses related to certain acquisitions from 25 to 40 years, effective_

_January 1, 1995, which resulted in decreased amortization expense of_

_approximately 1,488,000 for the year. This change in accounting policy_

_substantially offset the normal increase in depreciation and amortization_

_of property and equipment used to generate increased operating_

_revenues_

In other words, operating earnings were enhanced from the change in the estimated lives of depreciable assets. In 1998, Waste Management restated its earnings for this and other irregularities, becoming at the time the largest restatement of earnings in corporate history.

### Lesson 3: If It's Too Good to Be True, It May Be

There are many corporate success stories, such as Microsoft and Wal-Mart

Stores, and we enjoy watching these successes. But each of these successes can be explained by the company's comparative or competitive advantage.

Value is not created from the proverbial thin air, but rather must come from some advantage the company is able to exploit.

In a study of a large number of U.S. companies, Chan, Karceski, and



Lakonishok examine the level and persistence of earnings growth rates

They find that in the period from 1951 to 1998:

The median growth rate of earnings was 10\% per year.

After removing dividends, the growth rate of earnings mirrored that of the gross domestic product, between 3\% and 3.5\%.

Only 5\% of companies have growth rates that exceed 29\% per year

- ver 10 years, with most of these highest-growth companies being smaller companies.
Persistence in sales growth does not always translate to persistence in earnings growth.
On average, only 3\% of companies have growth consistently above the median for five years running.
A classic example of unrealistic growth is the case of Enron. Looking at the growth in revenues of Enron Corporation from 1986 through 2000, we see that revenues grew at an average annual rate of 20.29\% and earnings grew at a rate of 22.43\% per year. You can see the growth in revenues in
Exhibit 10.2(A). In fact, Enron's revenues more than doubled from fiscal year 1999 to 2000.
EXHIBIT 10.2 Enron Corporation, Revenues and Capital structure, 1986–
_Source of data:_ Enron Corporation 10-K filings, various years, and [www.enron.com.](http://www.enron.com/)
But this growth was not without its problems, as we saw with the eventual scandal and bankruptcy that followed fiscal year 2000. Enron relied heavily
- n accounting gimmicks and debt financing to fuel its revenue growth. By
2000, Enron reported that over 82\% of its assets were financed with debt— and this does not consider the debt that was shifted off the balance sheet through the various special purpose entities. We have graphed the reported liabilities and equity of Enron Corporation from 1986 through 2000 in
Panel B of Exhibit 10.3.
The growth in Enron was based largely on debt financing, which is difficult to sustain over time.
EXHIBIT 10.3 Enron Corporation's Operating Income vs. Cash Flow from
Operations
_Source of data:_ Enron Corporation 10-K filings, various years, and [www.enron.com](http://www.enron.com/)
### Lesson 4: Follow the Money

An analysis of a company must include an analysis of its cash flows.

Alongside the typical financial ratios, an analyst should also be looking closely at cash flows—the trends in these flows, as well as how cash flows compare to income. Cash flow information is generally more reliable than earnings information because earnings may include noncash income and expense items that are arbitrary.

We can see some of the problems of Enron by looking beyond the annual figures to see the patterns emerging on a quarterly basis. Many companies experience seasonal fluctuations in their business, which affects revenues and net income. We often see a difference between a company's cash flow from operations and its operating income, which is resolved over time; in

- ther words, the differences between operating income and cash flow from
- perations are generally zero, when considered over time.
In the case of the Enron Corporation, whose cash flows we depict in
Exhibit 10.3, the relation between cash flows and earnings was not as expected. On a quarterly basis, as shown in Exhibit 10.3(A), cash flows from operations were largely negative in many quarters in which operating income was positive. In Exhibit 10.3(B), we can see how the growth in
- perating income far exceeded that of cash flows from operations, suggesting that there may have been some management of earnings.
The question arises as to why financial analysts did not see these problems as they occurred. First, hindsight is 50-50 and it is not easy to detect fraudulent acts that distort publicly available financial information.
Second, some analysts did point out some problems with Enron prior to the scandal, but it is difficult for naysayers to get attention with a stock that was
 rising and a company that has investment-grade ratings
### Lesson 5: Understand the Risks

There are many risks that a company faces and the types and extent of these risks vary from company to company, even within the same industry. For example, if you consider airlines and their problem with a high degree of business risk, you can see differences in how these airlines manage these risks as shown in Exhibit 10.4.

The ratio of debt to equity is wide ranging in this industry, suggesting different willingness to add financial risk to the already substantial business risk. Therefore, there are two dimensions to understanding risks: (1) understanding what they are; and (2) understanding how companies deal with these risks.

### Types of Risk

The types of risks that a company faces are varied, but we can use financial analysis to get an idea of the company's sales, operating, and financial risk.

However, there are more specific risks that companies face. We can get an idea of these risks by looking at the company's market risk disclosure (Item

7A in the company's 10-K filing).

Consider the risks disclosed in International Business Machine's 2010 10

K filing (pp. 10–11):

Downturn in economic environment and corporate IT spending.

May not meet growth or productivity objectives.

Failure in innovation initiatives.

Competitive offerings.

Breaches in data security.

Financial results are difficult to predict.

Political risk.

Tax risk.

Ineffective controls.

Currency risk.

Customer financing risk.

Changes in liquidity conditions in the market.

Reliance on third party distribution channels.

And in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market

Risks from _IBM 2010 Annual Report_ (pp. 53–54):

Interest rate risk.

Currency rate fluctuations.

Collectability of accounts receivable.

Recoverability of residual values on leased assets.

These risks are different, say, from a company that relies on raw materials

(such as oil or agricultural products), or that relies on consumer discretionary spending (such as a retail store).

An analyst may derive information about a company's other risks from the company's disclosure about contingencies (e.g., lawsuits) and segment disclosures.

### Management of Risks

Though most companies are exposed to interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, credit risk, and other risks, the analyst must examine how companies manage these risks. For example, many companies use

 derivatives to affect the magnitude or the direction of such risks Analysts need to understand the actions and transactions that companies take to manage risks. For example, who are the counterparties in a swap transaction? Is the company hedging their interest rate risk? If so, what means are they using to do so?

Many companies, for example, hedge some of their risk using derivatives such as forward, futures, and swaps. A company's use of derivatives will be disclosed according to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.

133, _Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities_ . When a company uses a derivative, it must determine at the outset how this derivative is being used:

If the derivative is being used to hedge exposure to changes in the value of an asset or liability, the extent to which the hedge is not effective is recognized in the income statement.

If the derivative is being used to hedge exposure to variable cash flows

(such as future cash flows from a forecasted transaction), the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss goes into comprehensive income

(and hence directly to shareholders' equity, bypassing the income statement), and then is recognized as a part of a gain or loss when the forecasted transaction affects earnings.

If the derivative is being used to hedge a foreign currency exposure of an investment in a foreign corporation, any gain or loss is a part of comprehensive income (and so goes directly to shareholders' equity, bypassing the income statement).

Actually, the accounting for derivatives is much more complicated than this simple description and results in a rather obtuse disclosure. Warren

Buffett sums up this reporting:

_If our derivatives experience—and the Freddie Mac shenanigans of_

_mind-blowing size and audacity that were revealed last year—makes you_

_suspicious of accounting in this arena, consider yourself wised up. No_

_matter how financially sophisticated you are, you can't possibly learn_

_from reading the disclosure documents of a derivatives-intensive_

_company what risks lurk in its positions. Indeed, the more you know_

_about derivatives, the less you will feel you can learn from the_

_disclosures normally proffered you. In Darwin's words, “Ignorance more_

 15

.

_frequently begets confidence than does knowledge_

And the true test of a company's use of derivatives, according to Warren

Buffett, is what it does over a period of time in which there is no growth, because everyone does well in a bull market. As he cleverly points out,

“You only learn who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out.  16

## THE FUTURE OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS IN THE POST-CRISIS ERA

There is no doubt that the financial scandals of the past few years and the resulting legislation, regulation, and rulemaking have changed financial analysis. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) is the single most important legislation affecting financial reporting since the Securities Act of

1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. SOX provides for more

- versight of the auditing function, increased corporate financial disclosures, and improved corporate governance.
There are many implications of SOX for financial analysis. Examples include the following:
**1.** The management discussion and analysis section of the 10-K filing is more informative. In particular, this section will provide information about off-balance sheet arrangements.
**2.** A larger number of events trigger an 8-K filing. The financial analyst therefore has more information about more events related to a company.
The additional triggering events include the entry or termination of a material definitive agreement, the completion or asset acquisition or disposition, creation of a financial obligation (direct or off-balance sheet), and changes in the certifying accountant.
**3.** An adverse opinion with respect to a weakness in internal controls should at least get the attention of the analyst. When SOX's internal control requirement (section 404) was first implemented, we expected a number of companies to have some type of ineffective internal control
- r weakness. However, beyond the law's initial implementation, a weakness or ineffective control should be a red flag to the analyst.
Additionally, there are many provisions in SOX, such as those to seek to reduce conflicts of interest, which provide more confidence in the data reported by companies.
One of the themes of SOX is the responsibility of the “gatekeepers” to
- ur financial markets. Along with auditors, boards of directors, and lawyers, financial analysts are important gatekeepers, with a responsibility to the capital markets. As gatekeepers, financial analysts have a responsibility to interpret financial disclosures, along with other available information, to provide useful information to stakeholders with regard to the company's financial condition and operating performance in the future.

Based on Section 409 of the SOX Act, companies are required to provide disclosure through an 8-K filing when there is a “material change in the financial condition or operations of the issues, in plain English, which may include trend and qualitative information and graphic presentations,” which includes restatements (Item 4.02 of SEC, RIN3235-AI47, “Final
Rule: Additional Form 8-K Disclosure Requirements and Acceleration of
Filing Date,” August 23, 2004).
7. This also tells us that an analyst should try to understand the reasons that companies restate their financial numbers. It is often the case that there are accounting irregularities.

Earnings,” _Journal of Accounting Research_ 40 (2002): 41–65; or David

12. And still a third issue is that there is a tendency for analysts to be
- very optimistic in the near-term in the case of companies issuing debt
(see Mark Bradshaw, “Playing Favorites: Financing Options Sway
Analysis' Thinking,” _Investor Relations Quarterly_, June 2004). There is harsh criticism of analysts who missed the problems with Enron (see “The
Watchdogs Didn't Bark: Enron and the Wall Street Analysts,” Hearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, 107th Cong., Senate
Hearing 107–385, February 27, 2002).
