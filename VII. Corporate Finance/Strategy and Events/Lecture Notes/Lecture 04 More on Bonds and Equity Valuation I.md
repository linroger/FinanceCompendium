# Default Risk Example: Manufacturing Company

- Three state world – equal probability

○ High Earnings – adequate to repay debt in full and a return to equity holders  
○ Middle Earnings – inadequate to repay debt in full, but enough to repay  $50 \%$ of outstanding debt

Equity holders wiped out

Low Earnings – inadequate to repay debt

- Company sold for value of remaining physical assets  
Equal to  $10\%$  of outstanding debt

# Default Risk Example: Manufacturing Company

- Value of debt outstanding: \$100 million (one year zero coupon)

$$
= (1 0 0 \times 1. 0 0 + 1 0 0 \times . 5 0 + 1 0 0 \times . 1 0) / 3 = 1 6 0 / 3 = 5 3. 3 3
$$

$\circ$  Risk free rate:  $5 \%$  per annum  
$\circ$  Expected return in one year  
$\circ$  Will pay less than:  $53.33 / 1.05 = 50.79$  

- Need more information on market risk profile to say more

# Credit Ratings

# Moody's Long-Term Rating Definitions

Moody's long-term obligation ratings are opinions of the relative credit risk of fixed-income obligations with an original maturity of one year or more. They address the possibility that a financial obligation will not be honored as promised. Such ratings reflect both the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered in the event of default.

Aaa Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with minimal risk.  
Aa Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.  
A Obligations rated A are considered upper-medium-grade and are subject to low credit risk.  
Baa Obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are considered medium-grade and as such may possess speculative characteristics.  
Ba Obligations rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk.  
B Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.  
Caa Obligations rated Caa are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk.  
Ca Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery in principal and interest.  
C Obligations rated C are the lowest-rated class of bonds and are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal and interest.

# Common Stock Trading

# - Primary Share Offering

- Usually an "Initial Public Offering" (IPO)  
O Preceded by a "Road Show"

- Company management and underwriters (Investment Banks) tell company's story to potential investors  
Determine level of interest – price and quantity of shares

- At offering, underwriters buy shares from company and sell on to institutional and individual investors

# Common Stock Trading

- Secondary offerings  
- Secondary share trading

Buy from other shareholders – not directly from company  
Vast majority of stock trading on this basis

- Ownership passes once trade is confirmed and settled

○ Payment made to seller and shares received by buyer

# Stock Markets

- A stock market is a venue where buyers and sellers "meet"

These were once principally physical "trading floors"

- Individuals shouted or used hand signals to trade
- "bid" (where I buy)  
- "offer" or "ask" (where I sell)
- Effectively been replaced by electronic networks

# Stock Trading on Traditional Venues

- Prior to market reforms a company's stock:
- Almost always traded on exchange where "listed"  
○ All trades in Ford Motor Company stock, for example, would have traded on NYSE

- Two largest exchanges were:

$\circ$  New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)  
○ National Association of Security Dealers Quotation (NASDAQ) system

# Post 2005 Market Changes

- Exchanges compete for limit orders to show best liquidity  
- More bids and offers shown on exchanges
- Increases comfort of buyer or seller – large mutual fund  
- Creates more "market orders" on that venue
- Institutional fund managers and retail investors are pricing takers  
- Specialized firms are price makers

# Example

<table><tr><td colspan="3">Advanced Micro Devices</td></tr><tr><td>Limit order: Buy or Sell</td><td>Amount Available</td><td>Price per Share</td></tr><tr><td>Sell</td><td>400</td><td>$65.00</td></tr><tr><td>Sell</td><td>200</td><td>$64.50</td></tr><tr><td>Sell</td><td>100</td><td>$64.00</td></tr><tr><td>Buy</td><td>300</td><td>$63.50</td></tr><tr><td>Buy</td><td>200</td><td>$63.00</td></tr><tr><td>Buy</td><td>500</td><td>$62.50</td></tr></table>

# Relationship between Stock Prices and Dividends

- Examine various valuation methods

$\mathrm{O} \quad \mathrm{P} / \mathrm{E}$  and  $\mathrm{P} / \mathrm{B}$  ratios vary widely within industries

Dividends

- Companies either pay earnings out in dividends or reinvest in the business

○ An equity investment may be thought of as a perpetuity

- Ultimately all cash is paid out to shareholders  
PV(Stock Price) = PV(expected dividends per share)  
Receive dividends and capital gains (losses)

# Relationship between Stock Prices and Dividends

# - Assumptions:

$\mathrm{O}$  Current Price,  $\mathrm{P}_{0}$  
$\circ$  Expected Price in one year,  $\mathrm{P}_{1}$  
$\circ$  Dividend payment,  $\mathrm{DIV}_{1}$

$$
E x p e c t e d r e t u r n, r = [ D I V _ {1} + P _ {1} - P _ {0} ] / P _ {0}
$$

Example: AAPL

$$
r _ {A A P L} = [. 92 + 174.62 - 126.01 ] / 126.01 = 39 \%
$$

# Relationship between Stock Prices and Dividends

- Rearranging the expected return equation

$$
P _ {0} = (D I V _ {1} + P _ {1}) / (1 + r)
$$

- Today's price equals the discounted value of the dividend plus the expected capital gain or loss  
- $r$  is the cost of equity capital or the market capitalization rate  
- When the market is well functioning

○ All investments with equivalent risk have the same expected return,  $r$

# Relationship between Stock Prices and Dividends

- By the same logic as previously presented, the future price for period 1 must equal:

$$
P _ {1} = (D I V _ {2} + P _ {2}) / (1 + r)
$$

and  $P_0$  must equal,

$$
(D I V _ {1} + P _ {1}) / (1 + r) + (D I V _ {2} + P _ {2}) / (1 + r) ^ {2},
$$

extending this to  $H$  periods we get:

$$
P _ {0} = \frac {\sum_ {t = 1} ^ {H} D I V _ {t}}{(1 + r) ^ {t}} + \frac {P _ {H}}{(1 + r) ^ {H}},
$$

let  $H \to \infty$  and  $P_0 = \frac{DIV}{r}$ , the perpetuity formula

1. Dividends increase at  $10\%$  per year, compounded.  
2. Discount rate (cost of equity or market capitalization rate) is  $15\%$ .

# Relationship between Stock Prices and Dividends

- How to obtain PVs of cumulative dividends and future price

$\circ$  For cumulative dividends use growing annuity formula:

$$
P V _ {C u m D i v} = \frac {\mathbb {S} 5 . 0 0}{. 1 5 -. 1 0} \times \left(1 - \left[ \frac {1 + . 1 0}{1 + . 1 5} \right] ^ {1 0 0}\right) = \mathbb {S} 9 8. 8 3
$$

$\circ$  For the future price we use the PV formula:

$$
P V _ {F u t u r e P r i c e} = \$ 1,378,061.23 / (1 + . 1 5) ^ {1 0 0} = \$ 1. 1 7
$$

If we assume the dividend continues into prepetuity,we obtain:

$P_{0} = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{DIV_{t}}{(1+r)^{t}}$ , the Dividend Discount (DCF) Model

# Estimating the Equity Cost of Capital

Expected dividend growth assumed constant:

$$
P _ {0} = \frac {D I V _ {1}}{r - g}, F l e d g l i n g e x a m p l e: \$ 1 0 0 = \frac {\S 5 . 0 0}{. 1 5 - . 1 0}
$$

- Expected return of comparable investments will equal:

$$
\mathit {R e a r r a n g i n g a b o v e f o r m u l a ,} r = \left(\frac {\mathit {D I V} _ {1}}{P _ {0}}\right) + g,
$$

states that the dividend yield plus divided by the stock price plus the expected growth rate equals the cost of equity capital

# Payout Ratio, Plowback Ratio and Return on Equity

- Payout and plowback ratios – alternative approach to long-run growth

$$
P a y o u t r a t i o = D I V / E P S,
$$

$$
P l o w b a c k r a t i o = 1 - P a y o u t R a t i o,
$$

measures earning company has available for investment

- Return on Equity (ROE)

Return on Equity = EPS/Book Equity per Share

# DCF Models and Utility Rate Setting

- State commissions regulate the rates (prices) charged by water, gas and electric utilities  
- How are these determined?

$\circ$  Provide a "fair" return to shareholders  
$\circ$  Should compare to unregulated companies with similar, low earnings volatility

- Examine Table 4.4 from text

Brealey, Myers and Allen: Table 4.4

# DCF Models and Utility Rate Setting

- Aqua America: Price:  \$33.62 Dividend:\$ 1.18

$$
\text{Dividend Yield} = \frac {\text {DIV}_1}{P_0} = \frac {1.18}{33.62} = 3.5 \%
$$

- Growth Rate

$\circ$  Analysts forecasts likely a few years out  
Revenues cannot grow much faster than population

If analysts' forecasts true for long - run,

$$
r = \frac {D I V _ {1}}{P _ {0}} + g = . 035 + . 066 = 10.1 \%
$$

# DCF Models and Utility Rate Setting

- Estimate payout ratio – given payout ratio has averaged  $60 \%$

$$
P l o w b a c k r a t i o = 1 - P a y o u t R a t i o = 1 -. 6 0 = . 4 0
$$

$$
\text{Given Return on Equity} = \frac {\text {EPS}}{\text {Book Equity per Share}} = 12.6 \%
$$

Assuming Aqua earns  $12.6\%$  and reinvests  $40\%$  of earnings, then book equity grows by  $40 \times .126 = 5\%$ .

Earnings and dividends per share will also grow at  $5 \%$

This provides an alternative estimate of the equity cost of capital,  $r = \frac{DIV_1}{P_0} + g = .035 + .05 = 8.5\%$

# DCF Models and Utility Rate Setting

- These estimates are likely unrealistically high given utilities' role. Would expect slowing in line with demographics of service area  
- But what if the investment requirements for utilities differ from other businesses?

$\circ$  Will return to this at the beginning of next lecture
