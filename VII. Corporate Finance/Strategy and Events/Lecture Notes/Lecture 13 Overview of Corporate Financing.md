# Different Investor Constituencies

- Management and Directors have primary duty to shareholders  
- Creditors (banks and bondholders) also have contractual rights
- Creates tension between different investor classes
- Risk/return tradeoff differs for debtholders versus shareholders  
- May differ between different classes of debtholders

○ Management and Board emphasis regarding different investor classes says a great deal about company

- Emphasizing ensuring debtholders are secure versus maximizing stock price today

# Sources of Funds

- Three broad categories:

$\mathrm{O}$  Internally generated  
Dividend policy  
Growth opportunities

- Debt (borrow money)  
Shareholders – secondary issuance

- Pecking Order Hypothesis (Stewart Myers)

# Sources of Funds

Key decisions:

$\bigcirc$  Ratio of funds used in business versus returned to shareholders  
$\bigcirc$  Ratio of Debt to Equity

- In recent years, Equity issuance is negative  
- Debt issuance growing since Financial Crisis  
Less investment in business

# Sources of Funds: US Nonfinancial Corporations

- Net equity issuance has been negative for more than two decades due principally to corporate stock repurchases

# Sources of Funds: US Nonfinancial Corporations

- Share repurchases have exceeded new issuance of stock in the market

○ Many large companies have repurchased their shares

Using profits  
Borrowing money through bond issuance

Why have they done this?

- Text raises concern regarding overreliance on internal funds  
- Concerns about growth prospects

○ Lack of positive NPV projects?

# Internal versus External Financing

- Some argue large corporations do not return enough to shareholders

Changed in recent years:

- Share repurchases  
- Increased debt issuance (low interest rates)
- Financial structure varies by industry

Large international bank  
○ Technology startup

# Nonfinancial Corporations: Debt (Percentage of Equity)

- Corporate debt as a percentage of total financing has increased since the Financial Crisis

# Corporate Debt Levels

- Debt levels have increased in the US and other countries

○ Example: China

Outstanding Domestic Private Debt Securities to GDP for China  
Credit to Government and State-Owned Enterprises to GDP for China  
General government gross debt for China

- Debt markets differ substantially among these countries  
- Nature of businesses differ as well

# Corporate Ownership

- Ownership versus Control

○ Ownership in a small or medium sized company comes with a measure of control over the company's plans  
○ Ownership in a large corporation usually implies little or no control – delegated to Board of Directors

- In large corporations, shareholders technically have right of control, but severely limited in practice

# Ownership of US Corporations

- Individual Shareholders  
- Institutional Shareholders

$\circ$  Mutual Funds  
$\circ$  Pension Funds  
Insurance Companies

Non-US investors

# Holdings of US Equities

# Ownership Rights and Issues

- Shareholder rights without debt

○ Cash-flow Rights  
$\mathrm{O}$  Control Rights

- Shareholder rights with debt
- Cash-flow rights contingent on meeting creditors' contractual rights  
$\circ$  Shareholders have a residual claim on company's assets

# Ownership Rights and Issues

- Financial Distress and Bankruptcy
- Owners may be forced to forego dividend payments or put more money into company  
- Bankruptcy places company under "protection" of court of law – creditors "estopped"
- Small and medium sized companies have only one or a few shareholders; large companies may have millions  
- Large company shareholders effectively limited to voting for Board members and limited other matters

# Ownership Rights and Issues

- Free-rider problem

○ Lack of shareholder-interest enables management to be more self-serving

Real world less clear-cut  
Large shareholders; activist investors

- Own  $5 \%$ or more of company  
See this currently regarding ESG issues

Large shareholders allow small ones to be free-riders

○ Ability for large shareholders to profit at the expense of small in some cases

# Voting Rights

- In theory, any shareholder may bring a matter concerning the company to a shareholder vote
- Required to obtain enough additional shareholders to place the matter on the ballot  
○ May be difficult or impossible with dual-class structure  
○ Some companies have been making it increasingly difficult to place measures on ballot

- ESG and compensation issues often raised

# ExxonMobil and Engine No  $1^{1}$

- Exxon is among the largest oil producers  
- Engine No 1 is a small, activist hedge fund

O Bought  $\$ 50$ mm of Exxon stock (.03% of shares)  

- Intention to change four board members and revise strategy to move more quickly away from hydrocarbons  
$\bigcirc$  Convinced major shareholders to vote for its position

# ExxonMobil and Engine No 1

- Key issue: "… no credible program to protect value in an energy transition"  
- Exxon vigorously fought Engine No 1's claims  
- ISS, a major proxy advisor, advised its clients, who include many large investment funds to support Engine 1's nominees  
- Several major Exxon shareholders announced they support Engine No 1's proposals  
- Three of the four Engine No 1 nominees were elected

# Other Shareholder Issues

Staggered Boards

○ Only a portion of the Board is up for approval each year  
○ Makes changing Board's members more difficult

- Supermajority requirements

○ More than 50% (e.g. 75%) of shareholders required to approve a measure

- Proxy Contests - Engine No 1/Exxon example above

# Dual-class Shares and Private Benefits

- Dual-class shares – one class provides different benefits than others, such as greater voting rights and specific control features

Facebook – Mark Zuckerberg owns approximately  $14.8\%$ economic interest, but  $53.8\%$  of voting rights

- Recently allowing him to turn down several ESG initiatives

○ WeWork – founder's spouse, in event of founder's death, had right to pick successor CEO

- Tunneling

# Partnerships and Other Organizational Structures

- Partnerships

$\mathrm{O}$  General  
$\mathrm{O}$  Limited

- Trusts – legal structures designed to hold specific assets

Real Estate Investment Trusts  
○ Special Purpose Entities

# Preferred versus Common Stock

- Public and private companies may issue preferred stock
- Publicly issued preferred stock receives a preference in receiving dividend payments
- Fixed payment to investors – no voting rights  
If preferred dividends unpaid, no common dividends paid – typically "cumulative"  
- Limited voting rights may be granted to preferred shareholders if dividend payments missed

$\bigcirc$  Private companies issue preferred stock to give certain investors, e.g. venture capital, preference in receipt of proceeds ahead of founders

# Debt Instruments

Major issues for CFO

$\bigcirc$  Debt maturity  
O Fixed or floating rate  
○ Currency choice  
Covenants and collateral  

- Straight or convertible bonds  
- Lease versus buy

# Debt Maturity and Fixed versus Floating Rates

- Long-term debt generally "more expensive" than short-term

However, reduces risk of cash crunch – think Covid  
○ Match maturity of liabilities with assets

- Fixed versus floating
- Do the company's earnings change with interest rate levels?  
○ Short-term rates generally below long-term

# Currency, Collateral and Covenants

- Try to match expenditures in country with borrowings
- Eurozone plant selling into Europe financed in Euros  
$\circ$  Risk of being unable to obtain the currency borrowed

- Collateral – banks and other lenders often granted a lien on plant, accounts receivable and other assets of the company  
- Covenants – promises made by the company to its creditors

○ Seniority of debt, rights and remedies; stricter covenants generally imply lower interest rate

# Convertible Bonds

- Bonds have the right, at the holder's option, to be converted into a fixed number of common shares at a certain price
- Coupon is below the coupon required on a straight bond by the same company  
○ Difference represents the implicit option premium paid for the option to convert into stock  
$\circ$  Example: ABC Corporation can issue a 10 year fixed rate note at yield of  $6 \%$  with \$1000 face value

Alternatively issue 10 year convertible at  $2 \%$ yield with right to purchase 20 shares of ABC stock at  $\$ 50$ /sh.

# Leasing and Supplier Finance

Leasing - rental of equipment, office space

○ Advantages depend on implied interest rate, tax treatment  
$\circ$  Capital (long-term) lease versus operating lease

Capital leases – effectively long-term debt obligations

- Supplier Finance – provides cash to sellers of goods and services internationally

$\circ$  May be abused to hide debt  
Greensill Capital

# Financial Markets and Intermediaries
