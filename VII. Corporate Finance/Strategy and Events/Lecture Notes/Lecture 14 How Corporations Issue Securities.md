# IPO Process

- Management interested in selling some shares since IPO market for tech companies is "hot"  
- Steps

$\circ$  Select Underwriters

- Advise company on sales process  
Buy IPO stock  
- Sell IPO stock to investors

○ Prepare registration statement  
○ Must be approved by SEC in US; comply with Blue Sky laws

# IPO Process

- Steps (continued)

○ Choose an exchange for trading  
○ Engage in "road show"  
$\circ$  Determine price level and allocations

Initial price level expected to be  $74 -$ 76/sh.  

- Priced at \$80/sh. after gauging investor interest
- Compromise between risk of "successful" sale and "leaving too much on the table"

# IPO Process

# - Steps (continued)

$\mathrm{O}$  Sell shares

Underwriter commitment: 900,000 shares  

- Greenshoe: 135,000

$\circ$  Underwriters sell 1,035,000 shares

Exercise greenshoe option  
If market appeared weak underwriters:

- Would not have exercised  
- Would buy shares to stabilize market

Stock trades to \$105/sh. on first day  

- 40 day quiet period post IPO

# Underwriters

- Underwriting risk
- Almost all issues underwritten – may be "best efforts"  
$\bigcirc$  Issues:

- Reputational - failed IPOs
- Due diligence  
- Allocation process – "spinning"

Financial - HBOS 2008 rights issue

- Morgan Stanley and Dresdner Kleinwort  
- Only  $8.3\%$  of the shares sold – failed underwriting  
- Underwriters hold the remainder – ultimately acquired by Lloyds TSB early 2009

# Underwriting Costs and Pricing

# Costs

○ Spread – difference between underwriting price and offering price; typically 7% for smaller issuers  
$\circ$  Additional fees – registration, legal, printing among others

# - Pricing

$\circ$  New issues often "underpriced"  
○ IPOs averaged 16.8% gain on few day based on one study

# Updated First-day Returns

# Hot New-issue Periods²

# IPO volume has been very low in the U.S. since 2000

In 1980-2000, an average of 310 operating companies went public every year In 2001-2020, an average of 113 operating companies went public every year Number of U.S. Offerings and Average Percentage First-day Return, 1980-2020

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/f59efb93-f079-47a6-b3da-5f35d023ba75/d5023cbdc8f739e646ae5bc7dff1e702f62e43fe85b4790ba957294ad0e21b2b.jpg)  
Number of Offerings (bars) and Average First-day Returns (line) on US IPOs, 1980-2020

- Bars show number of IPOs; Chart in text shows proceeds  
- Long-run (three year holding period) investors lose  $18.7\%$  - passive index funds "must" invest

# Alternative Issuing Procedures

US IPOs typically employ book building process

- Institutional buyers indicate where they would buy IPO  
- Underwriters may give preference to certain potential buyers
- Recently companies have engaged in primary direct offerings

○ Only sales from existing shareholders – no new money  
Lower fees but greater uncertainty of price level

# Auctions

- Primary direct sales are an example  
- Sovereign bond sales  
- IPOs were replaced by auctions in some countries historically  
- Auction types:

○ Discriminatory – each buyer pays price bid  
○ Uniform-price – all buyers pay the lowest winning price

- Economists argue uniform-price should maximize proceeds

# Security Sales by Public Companies

# - General Cash Offer – Debt or Equity

○ Issue registered with SEC; sold to underwriters  
○ Similar process as IPO  
○ SEC Rule 415 – shelf registration requirements<sup>3</sup>

- At least one class of securities SEC registered  
- At least 12 months subject to reporting requirements  
- No missed dividends or defaults since last financial statements issued  
- First time issuance has additional requirements

# General Cash Offer Costs

Notes: There were 5,706 domestic issues between 2004 and 2008. Closed-end funds (SIC 6726), REITS (SIC 6798), ADRs, mortgage-backed, and federal agency (SIC 6011, 6019, 6111 and 999B) issues are excluded.

- Some costs are fixed; others vary with size

# Market Reaction to Stock Issues

- Public companies' stock issuance announcements generally cause  $2 \%$ to  $4 \%$ price decline  
What is the explanation for this?

$\circ$  Should be a function of the expected use of funds  
○ Text explanation

Companies issue stock when the price is relatively high (overvalued) in minds of management  

- Investors react by selling the stock, reducing its price, and reducing the value of new issuance to company  
Most economists support this view

# Rights Issues

- Rights Issue or Privileged Subscription – company offers the right to buy stock to existing investors first

$\circ$  Typically offered by non-US companies  
○ Often company is troubled and having difficulty raising additional capital

- Price is below current market price
- Underwriters commit to buying any stock not sold to existing investors

# Deutsche Bank Example

- 2017 – Deutsche below minimum capital threshold

O Needs to raise €8 bn; current share price €18.00  

- Offers right to buy 1 sh. for every 2 shs. held at €11.65  
○ Implies post offer price will be €15.88:

If owned 2 shs., value = €36, buy one share @ €11.65  
Now own 3 shs. =€47.65 invested = €47.65=3×€15.88  
€15.88 known as ex-rights price

- Investors had a choice of putting in new money and maintain value or have the value of their existing shares reduced  $11.8\%$

# Private Placements<sup>4</sup>

- May only be sold to Accredited Investors or Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933

$0.5$ Accredited Investor -- net worth of  $1 \text{mm}$ or annual income of  \$200,000 for an individual (\$ 300,000 for a couple); trust or certain other entities with assets of  $5 \text{mm}$ ; certain designated financial professionals  
$0$ QIB – Certain institutional investors with unaffiliated assets of  $100 \mathrm{~mm};$ banks and thrifts  $\$ 25 \mathrm{~mm};$ broker-dealers  $\$ 10 \mathrm{~mm}$

# Private Placements

- Often specific types of debt or equity targeted at certain types of buyers

○ Commercial mortgage bonds places with an insurance company  
○ Preferred equity for a small company

- Transactions are far more customized than public bond or equity offerings

Buyer is typically expected to hold the security to maturity

# What Could Go Wrong? FTX<sup>5</sup>

- On November 11, 2022 FTX Trading LTD., et al. ("FTX") filed for bankruptcy in the United States bankruptcy court for the district of Delaware  
- FTX was founded in 2019 as a cryptocurrency exchange
