# Age Refining<sup>1</sup>

- Public record information available  
- We placed Age in bankruptcy when owner refused to put in additional equity  
- Became de facto equity owner – protracted, ultimately fruitless, negotiations with owner ensued

$\mathrm{O}$  Resulted in substantial mark down  
$\mathrm{O}$  Then the trouble started

# Age Refining<sup>2</sup>

- Fuel truck driver caused massive explosion and fire  
- Plant unusable for several months  
- Kept Chase Capital from selling at a distressed price – no buyers  
- Ultimately Age Refining Inc. sold to NuStar Energy LP in court administered 363 sale  
- Received all interest and principal, including penalty interest

# Financial Distress Costs and Firm Value

- Costs of financial distress are an important departure from perfect capital markets  
- Example above demonstrates

Substantial direct and indirect costs related to proceedings  
$\circ$  Negotiations with owners went on for many months:

- Attempted to reach a solution outside of bankruptcy  
- Known as a "workout"

# Financial Distress Costs and Firm Value

- Direct Costs include:

$\circ$  Attorneys' fees  
Outside experts

Financial (turnaround)  
Strategic  
Accounting  
Appraisers and Auctioneers

Studies have shown that such costs average 3 to  $4 \%$ of the company's value and as much as  $10 \%$

# Financial Distress Costs and Firm Value

- Company's majority creditors and shareholders may agree to a prepackaged bankruptcy – a "prepack"

○ Reorganization plan agreed prior to filing Chapter 11  
$\circ$  Approved relatively quickly  
Less expensive

- Minimizes costs and forces acceptance by minority creditors or shareholders

# Back to the Theory: Shareholder and Creditor Rights

Shareholders have the right to put their company into bankruptcy

○ Not an all or nothing proposition  
Creditors may also place company in bankruptcy

- Must consider Lender Liability
- Loss of business value typically occurs prior to formal notice of financial distress or bankruptcy filing
- Costs of distress or bankruptcy limited to the incremental costs they impose on the business

Asset value

# Ace Limited versus Ace Unlimited

- From MM propositions we know Ace's asset value is \$1000  
- With Ace Unlimited, creditors know they can obtain potential recovery from owners

$\circ$  Results in lower interest rate, less restrictive covenants

- With Ace Limited, no recourse to shareholders

$\circ$  Creditors will charge a higher rate and require more restrictive covenants  
○ Greater likelihood of bankruptcy and restructuring

# Ace Limited versus Ace Unlimited

- Assuming Ace is sold for the value of the bonds

Creditors receive the remaining value after bankruptcy costs are paid

# Indirect Costs of Bankruptcy

- Consent of the Bankruptcy Court is required for all financial decisions

$\circ$  At risk of each judge's priorities  
○ May end up on the wrong side of a cram-down

- Maintain going concern vs. value preservation for creditors

○ Eastern Airlines example: substantial value destroyed during bankruptcy process

- Eastern ultimately administratively insolvent: unable to repay creditors

# Debt and Incentives

- Creditor and shareholder interests generally aligned when company is performing as expected
- Interests often diverge during financial stress  
○ If firm is not in bankruptcy, owners (management) often effectively in control of decisions

Shareholders incentivized to "go for broke" or to ensure that creditors do not benefit from capital contributions if company in financial distress

# Circular File Company

- Circular File is in financial distress:

Circular File Company (Book Values)  

<table><tr><td>Net working capital</td><td>$ 20</td><td>$ 50</td><td>Bonds outstanding</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed assets</td><td>80</td><td>50</td><td>Common stock</td></tr><tr><td>Total assets</td><td>$100</td><td>$100</td><td>Total value</td></tr></table>

Circular File Company (Market Values)  

<table><tr><td>Net working capital</td><td>$20</td><td>$27</td><td>Bonds outstanding</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed assets</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>Common stock</td></tr><tr><td>Total assets</td><td>$30</td><td>$30</td><td>Total value</td></tr></table>

# Risk Shifting

Shareholders win only if Circular's value exceeds \$50 and are presented with the following investment opportunity:

Now

Possible Payoffs Next Year

$\bigcirc$  Assumptions:

Bonds not due for one year  

- No ability for bond holders to call a technical default  
- Circular has \$10 cash

# Risk Shifting

- The project has an NPV = -\$2

Stock likely worthless in one year without the project  
Shareholders use the creditors' money to invest

- Market value of Circular falls to \$28

Circular File Company (Market Values)  

<table><tr><td>Net working capital</td><td>$10</td><td>$22</td><td>Bonds outstanding</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed assets</td><td>18</td><td>6</td><td>Common stock</td></tr><tr><td>Total assets</td><td>$28</td><td>$28</td><td>Total value</td></tr></table>

- \$10 of cash replaced by risky\$ 8 asset; stock value increases

# Refusal to Contribute Equity Capital (Debt Overhang)

- Circular now has opportunity to invest in + $\$ 5$ NPV project

$\circ$  Circular should issue \$10 new stock to fund project  
\(\circ\) Firm value increases by \(15

- \$8 to bondholders  
- \$7 to equity holders

Shareholders do not invest since receive less than invested Circular File Company (Market Values)

<table><tr><td>Net working capital</td><td>$20</td><td>$35</td><td>Bonds outstanding</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed assets</td><td>25</td><td>10</td><td>Common stock</td></tr><tr><td>Total assets</td><td>$45</td><td>$45</td><td>Total value</td></tr></table>

# Refusal to Contribute Equity Capital (Debt Overhang)

Stockholders may refuse to contribute capital to an NPV positive project if value goes to creditors

○ In real situations a sharing of risk and reward may be negotiated

- This situation is known as Debt Overhang
- Company has so much debt that new equity investment cannot be obtained

# Additional Shareholder Strategies

- Cash in and Run (Tunneling)
- Owners always know more than creditors and may take advantage of that knowledge  
O Allegedly took place in FTX case through misappropriating customer funds and defrauding bank lenders

- Playing for Time
- Disguising fraud – company purposely misleads creditors, customers and investors

FTX example coming up

# Additional Shareholder Strategies

# - Bait and Switch

○ May lead to financial distress as well as use in distress  
$\circ$  Begin to add debt after long time policy of conservative capital structure

- Often facilitated by banks and bond investors  
Low rates in recent years have led to increasing leverage and decreasing credit premiums

- "Covenant-lite" structures

$\circ$  Increases risk of pre-existing debt

- Lowers existing bond prices – raises equity value

# Agency Costs of Borrowing

- Lenders try to limit leverage, but
- Competition makes this difficult  
○ Ms. Ketchup: two potential projects

One, low risk, low return "sure thing"  
Second, high risk, negative NPV project

<table><tr><td>Now</td><td>Investment</td><td>Payoff</td><td>Probability of Payoff</td></tr><tr><td>Project 1</td><td>-12</td><td>+15</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Project 2</td><td>-12</td><td>+24</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>0</td><td>0.5</td></tr></table>

# Ms. Ketchup Example

- Ms. Ketchup wants to borrow PV(\$10) from her bank and will provide the remaining funds herself  
- Bank projections show the following:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Expected Payoff to Bank</td><td>Expected Payoff to Ms. Ketchup</td></tr><tr><td>Project 1</td><td>+10</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>Project 2</td><td>(0.5 × 10) + (0.5 × 0) = +5</td><td>0.5 × (24 - 10) = +7</td></tr></table>

What can the bank do?

# Ms. Ketchup Example

What can the bank do?

○ Only fund Project 1 (purpose of loan)  
○ Require substantially larger equity contribution from Ms. K to lend against Project 2  
○ Place milestones and other restrictions on the company if Project 2 is undertaken – before loan proceeds disbursed  
○ Increase monitoring requirements

- No contract covers every eventuality

# Type of Asset and Cost of Distress

- Expected loss is probability of default times loss given default  
- Many asset types have numerous potential operators

○ "Essential" businesses allow for greater leverage  
○ Collateral such as oil and gas in the ground valued conservatively

- Businesses that borrow less than average

○ Greater cyclicality or unable to use tax shield

# Trade-off Theory

- Leverage based on

$\circ$  Degree and volatility of profits  
$\circ$  Perceived liquidity of assets

- Substantial costs to change capital structure  
- Companies' target specific ratios or debt rating  
- Debt also viewed as disciplinary tool  
- Companies rarely base leverage on optimal tax structure

# Pecking Order and Information Asymmetry

- Executive management and Board ("insiders") know more about company's condition than others – including creditors  
- Smith v Jones - volatile industry

$\circ$  Identical opportunity for each company  
$\circ$  Current share price \$100

<table><tr><td></td><td>Smith &amp; Co.</td><td>Jones, Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>True value could be higher, say</td><td>$120</td><td>$120</td></tr><tr><td>Best current estimate</td><td>100</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>True value could be lower, say</td><td>80</td><td>80</td></tr></table>

# Smith v Jones

- Make different financing choices

○ Smith announces issuance of 1.2 mm shares of stock  
$\circ$  Jones announce issuance of \$120 million five year note

- Investors would perceive issuance of shares as pessimistic

$\circ$  Smith selling stock @  $100 / \mathrm{sh}$ . – stock must be worth less  

- Jones issuing debt – stock must be worth more
- Result: both companies will issue debt regardless of their view

# Financial Slack

- Cash, short-term investments and unutilized credit lines

○ Valuable when opportunities require quick action  
$\circ$  Drag on financial returns since earning well-below WACC

- May encourage management to spend on poor earning assets

○ "Empire" building  
○ Executive perks  

- More debt may be the "cure"

# Theory of Optimal Capital Structure

- Financial world is too complex to accommodate a single theory that explains capital structure  
- With the potential exception of banks (deposits), value comes from the firm's assets  
- Mature, more stable companies tend to borrow more  
- Growth companies tend to borrow little

○ Higher risk  

- Less opportunity to use interest tax shield

# FTX Bankruptcy

- We have seen that bankruptcy is expensive

○ Should FTX have been placed into bankruptcy?  
Why did management oppose filing?  
○ What can bankruptcy achieve?  
○ What open issues remain?

# Should FTX have been placed into bankruptcy?

- Why were Alameda's holdings of FTT such a shock?

On November 2, 2022 Coindesk reported that Alameda held more than \$5.0 billion of FTT representing more than 192 million of the 328 million FTT outstanding  
Market assumption to this point would have been that unaffiliated entities owned nearly all the unlocked FTT  
○ Once it was clear that a large portion of FTT was controlled by an affiliate the price began to fall

# Should FTX have been placed into bankruptcy?

- On November 6, Finance announces intention to sell its holdings of FTT, estimated at 95.5 million FTT, worth approximately \$2.1 billion $^{5}$

$\circ$  Alameda proposes purchase of Binance's holdings at \$22/FTT

- Other FTT holders withdraw and sell \$5 billion of FTT
- By November 8, FTT drops to  \$8 and FTX attempts to find up to\$ 6 billion in new investment  
- Investment search fails. FTX and affiliates file for bankruptcy on November 11

# Why did management oppose filing?

- Two key management members cooperated with federal authorities

Caroline Ellison and Zixiao "Gary" Wang  
$\mathrm{O}$  Presumably will testify against Bankman-Fried

- Bankman-Fried understood that providing Alameda with FTX customer funds was in violation of their procedures and illegal according to a new federal indictment published February 23

# Why did management oppose filing?

- New indictment charges Bankman-Fried with additional securities fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud<sup>6</sup>

The charges include the following additional actions:

- Regular removal of customer funds from FTX to finance both Bankman-Fried and Alameda's expenditures  
Provided tens of millions of dollars of FTX funds to influence political campaigns using others' names to disguise the true source  
- Created secret loops in computer code allowing Alameda to incur multi-billion dollar negative balances  
- Used self-deleting messaging to delete records  
- Sent internet messages and made statements he knew to be false to perpetuate the fraud

# What can bankruptcy achieve?

- Order – the bankruptcy process allows for professionals to come in and assess what happened, find customer, creditor and investor funds  
- Fairness – the process cannot rewind the clock but can fairly distribute whatever value remains  
- Closure – the bankruptcy process and federal court cases will bring closure on the many remaining open issues and determine the true extent of the fraud

# What Open Issues Remain?

- Understanding the extent of the fraud

Determining the amount of money actually lost by investors  
Proving who participated in the creation and perpetuation of the fraud and bringing those individuals to justice

- Determining the role of the venture capital and other investors
