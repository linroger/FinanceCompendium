**Date**: December 4, 2025
**Source**: MinerU_Corporate Finance Lecture Notes__20251205022243.md
**Output Directory**: `/Users/rogerlin/Downloads/minerumd/split_output/Corporate_Finance_Lecture_Notes/`

## Executive Summary

Successfully split the Corporate Finance lecture notes into **17 individual lecture files** based on major topic boundaries. Each file represents a complete lecture session with clear topic focus.

## Methodology

### Identification Strategy
- Identified lecture boundaries using "Dave Schabes" author markers
- Verified chronological date headers (January 3 - March 2, 2023)
- Analyzed topic transitions between lectures
- Ensured each split represents a complete, coherent lecture unit

### Boundary Detection

Each lecture was identified by:

1. Instructor name marker: "Dave Schabes"
2. Date header in format: "Month DD, YYYY"
3. Topic title (often as markdown header)
4. Natural content breaks

### Quality Assurance
- Verified first and last lines of each file
- Confirmed sequential numbering (01-17)
- Checked file sizes and line counts
- Ensured no content loss or duplication

## Files Created

## Splitting Rationale

### Why 17 Lectures (Not More)?
- Each "Dave Schabes" marker indicates a distinct class session
- Dates confirm chronological progression over 9 weeks
- Topics align with standard Corporate Finance curriculum structure
- Each lecture represents 2-3 hours of classroom instruction

### Why Not Fewer?
- Combining lectures would create overly large files (>1000 lines)
- Would lose granular topic organization
- Dates indicate separate class sessions
- Pedagogical value in maintaining lecture-by-lecture structure

## Usage Recommendations

### For Students
- Study lectures sequentially for best comprehension
- Lectures 1-7 are foundational (must understand first)
- Lectures 8-10 introduce risk (critical for later topics)
- Lectures 11-17 apply earlier concepts

### For Instructors
- Each file represents ~1 class session
- Can assign individual lectures as pre-reading
- Easy to reference specific topics by lecture number
- Case studies are embedded in relevant lectures

### For Researchers
- Quick topic lookup via descriptive filenames
- Manageable file sizes for text analysis
- Chronological organization preserved
- Easy to extract specific sections for citation

## Technical Notes

### Encoding
- UTF-8 encoding maintained
- Special characters preserved (mathematical symbols, superscripts)
- Image references maintained (CDN URLs)

### Markdown Compatibility
- Standard Markdown format
- LaTeX math notation preserved
- Tables in HTML/Markdown hybrid format
- Compatible with most Markdown renderers

### Image Handling
- Image URLs preserved from original document
