# 2 Introduction – According to Cecchetti & Schoenholtz "Money, Banking, and Financial Markets"

# 2.1 Financial Instruments

# Contents

# Six Parts of the Financial System

I. Money  
II. Financial Instruments  
III. Financial Markets  
IV. Financial Institutions  
V. Regulatory Agencies  
VI. Central Banks

This course focuses on 2, 3, 4

- Cecchetti & Schoenholtz has a nice overview - their Ch 3 (Ch1 in ebook)

# Financial Instruments / Securities

- A financial instrument is the legal obligation (contract) to transfer something of value at some future date  
- Usually transfers of money (versus, say, labor contract which is about labor)  
- Very general definition  
- Easier to see in examples:  
- Bond: government or corporation promises to pay fixed cash flows at specific dates  
- Stock or equity: corporation promises to pay portion of profits (if there are any)

Can become very complex - but underlying ideas simple:

- Transfer cash today vs tomorrow (discounting)  
- Transfer risk

# Uses of Financial Instruments

I. Means of Payment

- For purchase of goods and services  
- Bank deposit (checking account) is a financial instrument. Use to pay for all kinds of things.  
- Electronic funds transfers, use bonds or stocks to pay

II. Store of value

- Transfer value from today into the future  
III. Transfer of risk - between people or over time  
- Options, swaps, futures. Insurance contracts

# Examples: Financial Instruments We Care About

see Cecchetti p 53

I. Government bond. Corporate bond.  
II. Equity  
III. Foreign Exchange  
IV. Bank demand deposits (checking account) - loan to a bank

- Keep Money a little separate
- Another course (History of Financial Crises)

# Bond - Government or Corporate

- Promises to pay fixed CFs, at fixed dates
- Example: \$6.50 every year for 4yrs, then \$100  
- Doesn't have to be fixed CFs (could float up and down) but most bonds
- Store of Value: Transforms current value into future value  
- Need to use discounting and PV  
- May involve risk  
Corporation promises to pay back, but may break promise

# Good Example of "Financial Instrument"

- Promise to pay you something of value  
- Usually pays "money" (dollars) - but not always - gold clause in bonds prior to 1933
- You need to give up something today to get this  
- Can sometimes use as payment

Government bonds OK  
Corporate bonds poor  

- Why? Need to study company to decide how valuable, whether company will pay in future  
- Not good as "money" - whatever that is

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/cda0f23d-ff5d-4f20-bae2-7d01d7e8f6a6/173831db4bc4110c152d50ae7b79d9239185f2f3ab89946d01acef50c359dffb.jpg)

# Equity

- Called "Equity" or "Stock"  
- Promise of company (corporation) to pay profits as dividends  
- As with bond, transforms current value into future value
- But unlike bond, no promises on how much - just paying out profits

# Foreign Exchange (FX)

- Buying and selling different currencies  
- Think of buying US dollars currency, selling British pounds
- Buy US $, Sell UK £  
 - Sell US $, Buy Chinese ¥ (Yuan)
- As I have described, a financial transaction  
- Actually, most FX transactions are instruments
- Agree to transfer currency in future - maybe 2 days, often 1 month or 6 months in the future (FX forward)

# Bank Demand Deposit - Loan

- Your bank or checking or deposit account  
- Hold this for last, because it is so special  
- We think of it and call it "money" - but really you are lending to the bank
  - You give money today, they promise to give it back  
Special kind of loan, two special characteristics I. Promise to pay back on demand & at par -  $1-per-$ 1 II. Upon default, pay first-come - first-served If you're late, you get nothing Strong incentive to get first in line - Bank Runs

- Very different than other loans (bonds)  
- Regular bond-holders, upon default, get pro-rata share (assets divided according to payment hierarchy)

Money & Bank deposits - topic of my "History of Financial Crises"

# 2.2 Markets

# Contents

# Market as "Information Processing Engine"

- Fundamental idea, throughout economics:
- When prices and markets are free and reflect demand & supply, they pull together a huge amount of information
- Prices convey information - all the information available to everyone - about the value of the thing and alternatives (see Hayek's 1945 address to AEA)  
- Two additional benefits:
- Prices are free (or at least pretty cheap)  
- Prices provide an incentive to act on the information
- Never, ever ignore market prices - believe markets  
- If you disagree, you might be right but you are betting against many other smart people

Hayek, 1945 address to the American Economic Association:

A little reflection will show that there is beyond question a body of very important but unorganized knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientific in the sense of knowledge of general rules: the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place. It is with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over all others in that he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made, but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation. We need to remember only how much we have to learn in any

occupation after our theoretical training, how big a part of our working life we spend learning particular jobs, and how valuable an asset in all walks of life is knowledge of people, of local conditions, and special circumstances. To know of and put to use a machine not fully employed, or somebody's skill which could be better utilized, or to be aware of a surplus stock which can be drawn down during an interruption of supplies, is socially quite as useful as the knowledge of better alternative techniques.

# Types of Markets

Cecchetti & Schoenholtz p 57

Primary vs Secondary

- Primary: governments or companies sell new securities  
- Secondary: we all buy and sell existing securities
- Centralized (auction) vs Over-the-Counter
- Centralized: Such as futures pits, where everyone gets together and prices set, usually by some auction process  
- btw, I highly recommend the Eddie Murphy / Dan Akroyd 1983 movie "Trading Places" - good depiction of pit trading  
- Over-the-Counter: individualized transactions between dealers and customers - US Treasury bonds
- Underlying vs Derivative
- Underlying: instrument based on an asset and promised CFs  
- Derivative: based on some other price. Example: futures, option

# Institutions

Cecchetti & Schoenholtz pp 66-67

# I. Banks

- Textbook Depository Institutions (1), Finance Companies (5)  
- I group these together because they both take short-term loans from the public and convert to long-term. Important regulatory differences, but economic & financial functions similar. Maybe also GSEs.  
Finance Companies often thought of as "shadow banking"

# II. Broker Dealers or Securities Firms

- Textbook Securities Firms (4)

# III. Investment Managers and Pensions

- Textbook Pension Funds (3)  
- Investment management terribly important, and under-represented in texts

# IV. Insurance Companies

- Textbook Insurance Companies (2)

# V. Central Banks

- Textbook not included, but an important part of the financial industry

# 3.2 Introduction to Fixed Income

# Contents

Short-Term (Money Markets) vs Long-Term ("Capital" or Bond Markets) Money Markets: Subsector of the fixed-income market

- Short-term  
Liquid  
- Low risk  
- Often large denominations  
- Names like Deposits, Fed Funds, Treasury Bills, Commercial Paper

Bond Markets: Subsector of the fixed-income market

- Long-Term  
- Liquid  
- Usually Low risk (but not as low as the Money Market)  
- Names like US Treasury Note, Treasury Bond, Government Bond (UK Gilt, German Bund, French Tresor), Corporate Bond, Eurobond, Yankee Bond, Mortgage Bond, Debenture

# Fixed Income or Debt or Bond

Receive money today, promise to pay back in future

- Payment fixed by contract, thus "fixed income"

Variety of characteristics

- Obvious: maturity, freq, coupon  
- Seniority (where in pay-back line)  
- Security (assets pledged)  
- Maturity: short-term or long-term  
- Securitization (corporate versus asset-back or mortgage-backed)  
- Callability

Covenants (restrictions on behavior)

- Debt ratios (how much debt)  
- Dividend payouts  
Events

UST or FIS are simple examples

# Seniority, Security, Securitization

# Mortgage bonds (senior)

- Long-term secured debt often containing claim against specific building or property

# Debentures (junior)

- Long-term unsecured issues on debt

# Collateral trust bonds

Secured by common stocks or other securities owned by borrower

# Equipment trust certificate

- Form of secured debt used to finance railroad equipment  
- Trustee retains ownership of equipment until debt is repaid

# Securitization

- Asset-backed (eg car loans, credit-card loans)  
- Mortgage-backed

# Variety of Bonds

# 4 TVM & PV as Framework for Fixed Income

# Contents

# Before "Bond Markets" - It's All PV

Wide variety of bonds, money markets, etc.

- They are all Cash Flows, calculate present value:

$$
P V = \frac {C F}{(1 + y)}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/cda0f23d-ff5d-4f20-bae2-7d01d7e8f6a6/41e079a6b1a9d3a86ce563d61cf7763f29e0f6a9ac953138a07736d2bb719c3b.jpg)

PV & TVM (Time Value of Money) comes from Micro I, budget line:

- Simple, but most important idea in finance

# 4.1 Unpacking the Budget Line

# Contents

# Unpacking the Budget Line: PV, FV, Discounting

Budget line - Start with 2 periods linked by savings: put in  $1, get$ 1(1+y)

- Start with no borrow / lend:  $s = 0$  - single point  
- Next allow lending:  $s > 0$ , extend line upper left (eliminate  $s$ )  
- Finally borrowing & lending:  $s < > 0$ , full budget line

$$
p _ {1} c _ {1} = m _ {1} - s; p _ {2} c _ {2} = m _ {2} + (1 + y) s
$$

$$
p _ {1} c _ {1} + p _ {2} c _ {2} / (1 + y) = m _ {1} + m _ {2} / (1 + y)
$$

$$
p _ {1} c _ {1} \cdot (1 + y) + p _ {2} c _ {2} = m _ {1} \cdot (1 + y) + m _ {2}
$$

- Can write as  $\mathrm{PV}$ :  $m_2 / 1 + y$  or  $\mathrm{FV}$ :  $m_1 \cdot (1 + y)$  
Budget line same either way  
- In FV form income higher, but so are "prices"  
- Note - have not used indifference curves - works for everyone

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/cda0f23d-ff5d-4f20-bae2-7d01d7e8f6a6/90bc7e9bd1fb021efdc8608dcf74c9c9035d531764a8bbe0055facd9e41dbd48.jpg)

# Right Hand Side Gives PV, FV & Discounting

$$
R H S: \begin{array}{l} P V: m _ {1} + m _ {2} / (1 + y) \\ F V: (1 + y) \cdot m _ {1} + m _ {2} \end{array}
$$

The RHS gives us the correct measure of income

- Today's money we call Present Value or PV  
- Tomorrow's money we call Future Value or FV

# $1 + y$  price between today & tomorrow

- interest rate, discount rate, yield, IRR, expected return

This is the single most important idea in finance

- If you understand this you understand most of finance  
- But I've spent most of my career learning, thinking, studying PV

A little like building a bridge: the physics is easy but the engineering is hard

I. Unpacking the budget constraint: PV, FV, nominal & real rates

- This budget constraint tells us everything we need to know about discounting, PV, FV, nominal rates, real rates. In fact everything we need to know about TVM (for certain - known - CFs).  
- But we need to unpack this budget constraint, and think about it a little carefully.
- Once we do that we will then use the ideas of discounting, PV, FV, etc. to examine every aspect of modern finance.  
- We will talk about bonds and discounting over multiple periods. About compounding and variable periods (rates per month, half-year, year). About nominal rates vs real rates. But the ideas all come back to this simple picture and simple budget line. (Have I ever said how wonderful budget lines are? I used to think they were really boring, but I've come to appreciate that a good part of economics is just thinking carefully about budget lines.)
- $\mathbf{PV}$ : So let's start by looking at the RHS or the budget constraint:  $p_1c_1 + p_2c_2 / (1 + y) = m_1 + m_2 / (1 + y)$ . The RHS says that the income for the budget line is the sum  $m_1 + m_2 / (1 + y)$ . We call this the Present Value, and it is the correct measure of income when we look at any set of CFs across time - we always need to discount future amounts (future CFs) back to today by  $1 / (1 + y)$ .
- This is the most important, maybe the only important thing, you will learn in this course: how to calculate and think about PVs.  
- PVs matter and only PVs matter. Nothing else you learn in finance is as important as this. In fact, there really is not much else in finance except PV  
- Three-quarters of this course is simply calculating  $m_1 + m_2 / (1 + y)$ . This becomes very complicated: What are the CFs? When are the CFs? What is the rate  $y$ ? How do we quote the discount rate  $y$  and how do we calculate the discounting  $1 / (1 + y)$ ? How do we get an appropriate rate?  
- But it all comes down to PV:  $m_{1} + m_{2} / (1 + y)$ .
- FV: the expression  $m_1 + m_2 / (1 + y)$  expresses income in terms of period-1 money. But we could also write the budget line in terms of period-2 money:

$$
p _ {1} c _ {1} \cdot (1 + y) + p _ {2} c _ {2} = m _ {1} \cdot (1 + y) + m _ {2}
$$

Now the RHS is the FV:  $m_{1} \cdot (1 + y) + m_{2}$ . FV is in terms of tomorrow's money (PV is today's money). For the budget line it is totally irrelevant, since it increases the income but also the prices on the LHS - the budget line does not change.  $(p_{1} \rightarrow p_{1} \cdot (1 + y) \& p_{2} / (1 + y) \rightarrow p_{2})$

II. The term  $(1 + y)$  or  $1 / 1 + y$  is the price between today and tomorrow.

- For every \$1 today, we get 1+y next period. For one year, y will be something like 0.04 or 4%.  
 - The term 1/1+y is called the discount factor: it tells us how much \$1 next period is worth today (it will be less than \$1, discounted)  
- y is called the interest rate, discount rate, yield, yield-to-maturity, IRR (internal rate or return), expected return. These all mean slightly different things.

Remember the different asset classes we discussed

Focusing on Bond Market now - compare US Bond & Equity

Each one is huge, relative to annual GDP  

- Bond Market bigger than Equity (plus Money Markets)  
Bonds: \$41.0 trn  
 Equity: \$30 trn  
 GDP (flow): \$19.39 trn

# 5.1 US Treasuries

# Contents

# Focus on US Treasury Market to Start

US Treasuries are known CFs - promised CFs certain to be paid

For valuation, etc., focus on only TVM, no uncertainty Learn various tools

PV, FV, discounting  

- Yield-to-maturity, yield curve, forward curve  
- DV01, BPV, risk and sensitivity

Three (really two): Bills, Notes, Bonds  
TREASURY BILLS

- Issued: 1 year or less (1mth, 3mth, 6mth, 1yr)  
 Discount bill - pay \$98 today, get \$100 in 1yr

# NOTES AND BONDS

- Technically, notes issued 2-10 yr maturity, bonds  $10+$  (30) yrs  
- No difference except in name  
- Pay  \$96 today, get coupon of\$ 3 every year for the next 30 yrs  
- Coupon paid every s6 mths (\$1.50 every 6 mths)

# New US Treasuries Issued Regularly

These bonds were issued long ago, now have just a few weeks to maturity

- Three bonds with 15-may-2021 maturity  
- Those are old bonds – probably old 10yr and 30yr  
- How do I know? Treasuries issued "at-par" with coupon  $\approx$  current rate  
- The 8.125s must have been issued 30yrs ago (1991) - rates have not been that high since  
Note - price  $>100$ . Why?

How do I know the  $8.125\%$  of 15-may-21 was probably issued in 2009?

- It is an old bond, either 2, 5, 10, or 30.  
- 5-year rates have not been  $8.125\%$  for the past five years, so can't be an old 5-year  
- 30-year rates were about  $8.125\%$  in May 1991, so it was probably issued then  
- Also, 10 & 30yr bonds (maybe 5s? - I don't think so) are issued with maturity date 15th

What is Bid & Asked?

- Bid: Price dealer pays (low - customer sells low)  
- Ask (offer): Price dealer sells (high - customer buys high)

15-feb-2052: the current (on-the-run) 30-year bond

- 2.250% or $2.250/yr, $1.125 every 6mth  
Coupon every 15-aug & 15-feb

Seems complicated

- But it's all PV of CFs  
- Next lecture, start studying CFs

Spring 2021 OTR is 2.250s of 15-feb-2052 (issued February, re-opened Apr 7)

http://www.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3020-treasury.html

What is Bid & Asked?

- Bid: Price dealer is willing to pay (low price - customer sells low)  
- Ask (offer): Price dealer requires to sell (high price - customer buys high)  
- Customer always buys at the high price, sells at the low.  
- Dealer makes money from the Bid/Ask spread

# 5.2 Other Bonds – US Agency, Other Gov't Bonds (UK, Germany, Japan)

# Contents

# Agency Bonds & Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs)

Long history of GSEs (FHLB 1932, Fannie Mae 1938, Freddie Mac 1970)

- Largest component: mortgages, subsidize market, encourage home ownership  
- Federal Home Loan Banks, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Farmer Mac, Farm Credit System, the Financing Corporation, and the Resolution Funding Corporation.

End 2017, debt outstanding - total \$8.9trn:

\$0.02trn Budget Agencies (e.g. TVA) – "on-budget"

\$6.7trn GSEs – "off-budget"

\$2.1trn Mortgage-backed pools – "off-budget"

Compares with US Treasury debt (held by public) about \$12trn What is "on-budget" vs "off-budget"? Somewhat artificial distinction

- Learned that in 2008 take-over of Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac

GSEs: Federal Home Loan Banks, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Farmer Mac, Farm Credit System, the Financing Corporation, and the Resolution Funding Corporation.

From Federal Reserve Flow of Funds (z1):

- Table L.103 end-2017 Debt Securities (GSE issues): \$6,716.3bn  
- Table L.211 end-2017:

\$8,867.2bn Total of on-budget and off-budget

\$24.4bn Budget Agencies such as Tennessee Valley Authority, Ex-Im Bank. Considered "on-budget"  
\$6,716.3bn Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). Considered "off-budget" or "off balance sheet"  
\$2,126.6bn Mortgage-backed pools from Agencies & GSEs. Considered "off-budget"

This compares with about \$12trn UST debt held by the public (and banks, etc). (from spread-sheet that takes apart FoF L.210 - \$14.9 marketable, \$2.2 non-marketable (\$17.1 total), but \$2.4 held by Fed and \$2.2 retirement funds)

The distinction between "on-budget" (an official obligation of the federal government and included in official deficit numbers) and "off-budget" (not officially an obligation and not included in official deficit numbers) is pretty artificial. Everybody kind-of knew that GSE debt was backed by the US government and we saw in 2008 that that belief was correct. Fannie and Freddie Mac (the two largest GSEs, involved in mortgage financing) were supposedly public companies but on September 7, 2008 the government took them over and explicitly guaranteed their debt.

# Yields on Agency Bonds - Between UST & Corporate

Agency bonds have some backing from US gov't, so less chance of default

- More chance than UST, less than Corporate bonds

Yields between UST & Corporate ("default risk" or "spread risk")

3.23% 10-yr UST  
3.30% US Agency 10-20yr (spread 7bp)  
3.91% Intermediate Corporate (spread 68bp)

Earn extra to compensate for chance of default (you don't get money back)

- Next lecture: start learning yield  
- In a few weeks, learn about default risk & uncertain CFs  
- This is an introduction to "spread":  $Yld_{agency} - Yld_{UST}$ , times 100  
- "bp" is yield x 100:  $3.30\%$  is .07% higher than  $3.23\%$ , or 7bp  
- Spread measures default risk - extra for uncertainty of CFs

For 5-oct-18, From http://www.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3022-bondbnchmrk.html?mod=topnav_2_3024 ("Bond & Index Benchmarks") and http://www.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3021-bondyield.html?mod=topnav_2_3024 ("Bond Yields" for UST) But note that I think there's a typo for "US Agency 10-20yr" - should be  $3.30\%$  not  $3.03\%$

3.227% 10-yr UST

3.300% US Agency 10-20yr (52 week spread 6-10bp)

3.910% Intermediate Corporate (spread 66-100bp)

The Agency bonds are between the UST and the Corporates in terms of chance of default. We haven't discussed default yet, but it is when you don't get paid back what you get promised. Remember that bonds are "promised CFs" - there is a contract that says what you should get paid. If the contract gets broken, that is default.

You should earn extra when there is a chance you won't get the CFs you have been promised, and a higher yield reflects the higher amount you expect to earn. We will discuss default and risk-adjusted discounting and risk-adjusted yields in detail, but for now we will just look at the quoted yields and note that the US Agency yield is higher than the UST and lower than the Intermediate Corporate.

The spread - the difference between yields - is the appropriate measure of default risk as we will see in a week or two. The UST yield is the pure TVM discount rate, reflecting the pure trade-off between today and tomorrow for known CFs. The Agency and Intermediate Corporate also have a component that reflects the uncertainty (the fact you might not get your CF). The higher yield or discount rate is the risk-adjusted discount rate. The difference or spread is a measure of the default risk.

# Other Government Bonds

Every developed and many (most) developing nations have bonds. Ideas are virtually all the same:

Periodic coupon, with final 100 payment  

- Some pay annual coupon, others semi-annual

List of some:

UK Gilts (for "Gilt-Edged" stock)  

- French BTAN (1-6yr) and OAT (Obligations assimilables du Trésor) 7 to 50 year  
- German Bunds (Schatz, Bobls, Bunds)  
Italy BTPs

My "Practical Guide to Bonds and Swaps" (https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1554029) covers the various conventions. Many, however, have changed and are now A/A.

Sources for conventions:

- http://treasurytoday.com/2001/11/day-count-conventions
- I'm not sure they are right in their definition of A/365(F) and A/365 (that they say is same as A/A). I think maybe there is some confusion between mm conventions (A/360 and A/365) and bond conventions (A/365(F) and A/A)  
- They say that Eurobonds have switched from  $30\mathrm{E} / 360$  to A/A

# Money Markets - Short-Term Debt

Money Markets: short-term; Bond Markets: long-term

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/cda0f23d-ff5d-4f20-bae2-7d01d7e8f6a6/104d68220c47de168de2e9d7fbfab96026360712f9b83d59db31852640c2ba57.jpg)

# Money Markets - Short-Term Debt

Subsector of the fixed-income market

Short-term  

- Liquid  
- Low risk  
- Often have large denominations

UST: TBills (0-1yr), about  $14\%$  of all gov't debt

From Fed Reserve Flow of Funds (z1):

- Table L.210, 2018:Q2. Total Marketable UST  $\$ {14},{933.7}\mathrm{{bn}}$  ,TBills  $\$ 2,{157.4}\mathrm{{bn}}\left( {{14.4}\% }\right)$

# Major Components of the Money Market

Money Markets: short-term; Bond Markets: long-term

<table><tr><td></td><td>$ billion</td></tr><tr><td>Small-denomination time deposits &amp; savings deposits (individuals)</td><td>\$8,991</td></tr><tr><td>Money market mutual funds (individuals &amp; corporations)</td><td>2,716</td></tr><tr><td>Large-denomination time deposits (corporations &amp; banks)</td><td>1,865</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial paper (corporations)</td><td>1,120</td></tr><tr><td>Federal Funds &amp; repurchase agreements (banks)</td><td>3,748</td></tr><tr><td>Treasury bills (gov’t)</td><td>1,527</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>\$18,967</td></tr></table>

For 2015, from Bodie, Kane Marcus, from Flow of Funds

For comparison, total US bond market in 2017 \$41,020bn

These numbers are from a table in Bodie, Kane, Marcus. They give source as "Flow of Funds Accounts" from the Board of Governors of the Fed (the z1 report). I started tracking down and the relevant tables appear to be L.205-L.210. I couldn't find the split between large & small time deposits but otherwise rough match.

# 6.2 Types of Securities

# Contents

# Various Types of Securities

Treasury Bills (government)

Discount: pay \$98 today for \$100 in 1 year  

- Quote: Bank Discount - above would be  $2\%$ .  
- Actual discount  $=$  Quote * (AD/360)

Commercial Paper (corporations)

Discount like T-Bills

Certificate of Deposit (CD, banks)

- Add-on yield. Actual coupon = Quote * AD/360  
- Can be small (for you & me) or large ( $>\$ 100,000$

Bank Deposits - Eurodollar Deposits (banks)

- Basically same as CD  
- LIBOR - London Interbank Offered Rate: 11am (London) quote for Eurodollar deposit

# CFs, PV, and Quotes

Bewildering variety of securities & quotes - need to untangle simple CFs

<table><tr><td>Different securities</td><td>Slightly different CFs, quotes</td></tr><tr><td>T-Bill, Comm Paper</td><td>Discount: pay less today, get \$100 at end</td></tr><tr><td>Cert of Depo, bank deposits</td><td>Add-on: pay \$100 today, get \$100+ at end</td></tr></table>

Think of security definition & quote as just a coded way to tell you CF

- Example: Eurodollar deposit,  $5\%$ , 1yr  
 - Eurodollar is a bank deposit, so put in \$100 today, get \$100+ at end  
Code: CF = Quote * AD/360  
 final CF = 100 + 5*365/360 = \$105.069

- NB: typo in picture - should be 105.069

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/cda0f23d-ff5d-4f20-bae2-7d01d7e8f6a6/17b145f8f6e8aaa79d6c6f190d7f5d55442d47e56d0fad935175fb6687d8d64c.jpg)

The trick with money-market securities, as with any fixed-income security, is to figure out the CFs. Then we can PV or do whatever we need to.

Virtually all money-market instruments (at least those with 1 year or less maturity) have a single future CF, with a diagram like the Eurodollar deposit above. A more detailed table (for US money-market instruments) follows. I know some of the quoting conventions but don't know others.

<table><tr><td>Security</td><td>Issuer/Buyer</td><td>Quote</td><td>CF today</td><td>CF at end</td><td>Example (Q=5%, 1yr)</td></tr><tr><td>Treasury-Bill</td><td>US Government, to investors &amp; other gov&#x27;ts</td><td>A/360 discount</td><td>100 - Q × AD/360</td><td>\$100</td><td>94.9306 = 100 - 5 × 365/360</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial Paper</td><td>Good-quality corporations, to investors</td><td>A/360 discount</td><td>100 - Q × AD/360</td><td>\$100</td><td>94.9306 = 100 - 5 × 365/360</td></tr><tr><td>Bank Deposit (eg libor)</td><td>Banks, to individuals and corporations</td><td>Add-on A/360</td><td>\$100</td><td>100 + Q × AD/360</td><td>105.059 = 100 + 5 × 365/360</td></tr><tr><td>Certificate of Deposit (1yr &amp; less)</td><td>Banks, to individuals and corporations</td><td>complicated</td><td>\$100</td><td>complicated</td><td>complicated</td></tr><tr><td>Banker&#x27;s Acceptances</td><td>Corporations for international trade, to banks &amp; others</td><td>Discount</td><td></td><td>\$100</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Bond repos (repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements)</td><td>Corporations &amp; Banks, to corporations &amp; banks</td><td>Complicated, usually add-on A/360</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Federal Funds</td><td>Banks, to Banks</td><td>overnight, discount</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

# Some Additional Short-Term Debt

Money Market Funds

- Individuals and corporations put money into MMF  
- MMF then buys other short-term debt (such as T-Bills or CP)  
- We use them like checking (deposit, bank accounts)  
- History: developed in response to Req-Q restrictions

Checking Account (bank deposit)

Usually think of this as "money"  

- But better to think of lending money to a bank
