# Contents

# Securitization - Pooling Assets & Cash Flows

Pooling of assets and repackaging of the underlying cashflows

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/cda0f23d-ff5d-4f20-bae2-7d01d7e8f6a6/3c8cfa8efdffad3366441e870ef32aaec699d4ad0c07fe6610291d5f92adada0.jpg)

# Examples

- Mutual Funds, hedge funds, Exchange Traded Funds  
- Mortgage-backed and asset-back securities  
Common Stocks  
- "Equity" (mutual fund) vs "bond" pools (MBS, "Securitization")

# Legal Structure

- "Fund" and "Manager" separate legal entities  
- Mutual Funds in US - Investment Co & Advisors Acts, 1940  
- Hedge Funds - often off-shore (eg Caymans) - tax & regulatory  
- Mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities (bonds)

# Reasons for Pooling

- Spreads & Diversifies risk (mortgage-backed bonds)  
- Lowers cost (mutual funds); professional management (hedge funds)  
- Investors: Access to assets unavailable otherwise  
- Sponsors/Owners: Move assets off balance sheet (borrow)

# Securitization

- Pooling of assets and repackaging of the underlying cashflows  
- Often into bonds  
- Sometimes "trancheing" to create different payment or credit characteristics from those of the underlying assets

# Securitization Assets:

- Assets that go into the pool  
- Often fixed income instruments such as mortgages or loans or corporate bonds or credit card receivables

Securitization Liabilities:

Often bonds but also mutual funds, common stocks  

- Sometimes structured in tranches ordered in terms of payment priority

# Examples

- Mutual Funds  
Hedge Funds  
- Mortgage-backed securities
- Pass-through (Agency - Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac - pass-throughs). Simply pool together a group of mortgages and pass through the income - payment of income and principal.  
- Tanched. Pool together a group of mortgages but sell different
- Other Asset-Backed securities - student loans, credit card receivables, even David Bowie's bond (1997 - revenues from 25 albums recorded before 1990)  
Common Stocks

- Not usually talked about as a securitization or pooled assets, but in many ways that is exactly what a share in a publicly-listed company is – a share in the cash flows generated by the pooled activities from the company.  
- Usually we talk about securitization of passive assets (things like other bonds or mortgages) and not active assets like for an on-going business.  
- This ties back nicely to the South Sea Co and the Mississippi Co, although the South Sea Co was truly a pooling of passive assets - simply government annuities
- Distinction between "equity"-type pools and "bond"-type pools
- Equity-type: mutual funds, hedge funds, ETFs. For these the investors get a proportionate share of whatever profits  
- Bond-type: Senior tranches for tranched securities: promised CFs. Here investors are promised a CF. The pooling is valuable usually because it improves diversification and makes the "promise" more reliable, more certain to be paid.

# Legal Structure

- "Fund" and "Manager" separate legal entities
- Manager may be Corporation  
- Fund often a Trust or a Partnership or itself a Corporation  
- The Fund hires the the manager and pays a fee plus various expenses  
- The Fund will often have a Board of Directors who represent the interests of the shareholders (owners of the Fund and thus beneficiaries of the fund's assets)  
- Assets are held in custody for the fund. Custodian is hired by the Fund, legally responsible to the fund and the Board
- Mutual Funds in US
- Investment Company (fund) which holds assets and sells shares in itself - proportionate share of cash flows
- Investment Manager (manager) who manages the assets of the Investment Company. But a legally separate entity that cannot take the assets from the Investment Company  
- Investment Co Act 1940 - sets rules and regulations for Investment Co structure and operations  
- Investment Advisors Act 1940 
- rules and regulations for managers

Hedge Funds

- Often the "Fund" is off-shore - say Carmen islands - for tax and regulator reasons.
- Mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities (bonds)
- Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) - separate legal entity that holds the assets, sells securities that are usually more bond-like than equity-like  
- Investors are lending money to the SPV with the promise to get paid back - that promise may be a good or a poor promise.

# Reasons for securitization

- Spreads & Diversifies risk
- Big reason for mortgage-backed bonds. If you invest \$100k in one mortgage then if the homeowner defaults you are out. There may be only a 5% chance but on that you lose everything. But if you invest \$100k in a mortgage-backed bond with 1,000 mortgages then there's a pretty good chance that 5% will default but then you only lose 5%, and in any case you can price that in up-front because it becomes pretty certain how much you will lose (5% of your investment) rather than all or nothing.
- Lowers cost of access (mutual funds) or provides professional management expertise (hedge funds)
- One of the biggest reasons for mutual funds and ETFs
- Helps monitor and discipline (maybe 1720, South Sea & Mississippi)
- This may have been a reasons for the South Sea Co and the Mississippi Co. Although they did it very poorly - in fact the South Sea managers were really fraudsters.  
- But the Bank of England that managed the government debt, while not really pooling the government assets, played this role.  
- Not something we think is necessary today for government debt, at least not in developed countries. But in 1720 could have been very valuable.
- Widens audience and market
- For investors can provide access to markets not available otherwise.

* E.g. for credit-card receivables, investors would have a hard time investing (buying) except through securitization.  
* David Bowie's records is another example - investors could not get invest if not securitized

- For Sponsors / Owners or assets, can be a way to "move assets off balance-sheet"

* What this really means is that it is a way to raise money, to borrow - collateralized.  
* e.g. mortgages. A bank makes mortgages, using its money to lend to homeowners.  
* It then pools those mortgages together, puts into an SPV, and sells bonds against those mortgages.  
* The investors are lending to the bank, with the mortgages as collateral.

# Pass-Through vs Trancheing (Waterfall)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/cda0f23d-ff5d-4f20-bae2-7d01d7e8f6a6/b44930f8edb564447b64afd6bc941ba8241e3e7ad8be931fad34bdf5d0670751.jpg)

# Outline

- Pass-through: all investors get same CFs
- Tranched: sell senior & junior (equity) tranches  
- Pre-specified rules ("waterfall") for how cash is distributed

# Simple Trancheing Example

"Senior": gets  $20\%$  of CFs, first priority  

- "Equity":  $80\%$  of CFs, but lowest priority  
Equity loses money first

Probability (54%) of \$10 loss – pay back either \$100 or \$90

- Senior is first priority, always gets \$20 (100%) back  
- Equity suffers the loss, gets either  \$80 (100\%) or\$ 70 (87.5%)  
- Senior riskless, Equity more risky (lose more than  $10\%$  of original)

Pricing (5yr, \$5 coup, 5% risky, 4% risk-free yield)

- Underlying must be $100 (PV($5 @ 5%))  
 Senior now risk-free, must be $104.45 (PV($5 @ 4%) - pay \$20.89 for 20%  
- Equity implied  $98.89 (100 = .2^{*}104.45 + .8^{*}98.89) - pay$ 79.11 for 80%

<table><tr><td></td><td>Share of pool</td><td>PV ($)</td><td></td><td>$ Paid</td></tr><tr><td>Senior Tranche</td><td>20%</td><td>$104.4518</td><td>→</td><td>$20.8904</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>↓</td></tr><tr><td>Equity Tranche</td><td>80%</td><td>$98.8870</td><td>←</td><td>$79.1096</td></tr></table>

# Pass-through versus trancheing

This detail (for example on tranching) is not necessary for History of Financial Crises – for Applied Financial Management

- Pass-through: all investors get same cash-flows - proportional to their ownership (investment)  
- Tranched: the cash-flows are "tranched" according to some set of rules
- Assets pooled, but then cash flows are "tranched" according to some rule, and different classes of securities (shares in the pool) sold.

Example:

- \$100 of mortgages.  
 - Mortgage is 5yrs, 5% coupon, pays back \$100 in 5 years. Price \$100, yld = 5%  
* Current risk-free rate is 4%. 100bp spread (risky 5%, risk-free 4%)

- But this mortgage is risky.  $54\%$  chance that  $10\%$  of the mortgages will default on the final principal repayment

* 54% chance that all coupons will be paid but that 10% of the mortgages will not repay the final \$100  
 * in other words 54% chance you get \$90 instead of \$100 at the end

- Trancheing can change the risk profile. Here will will tranche into senior (with no risk) and equity (with the remaining or residual or increased risk)
- Make 2 branches: Split  $100\%$  (100 shares) into top  $20\%$  and bottom  $80\%$

* Top tranche is called the "senior" tranche - 20% of this pool is "senior"  
* Bottom tranche is called "equity" tranche - 80% of this pool is "equity"
* Senior tranche (top 20%) gets first priority for cash flows – either coupon or principal. Every \$1 that is supposed to come in, these shares get the first 20¢
* Equity tranche (bottom 80%) gets whatever is left. Every \$1 that is supposed to come in, these shares get whatever is left after paying the 20¢ to the top tranche  
 * Example: \$100 is promised. \$90 comes in. Senior tranche gets \$20 (20% of the \$100 promised). Equity tranche gets \$70 (what is left). Since the equity tranche was promised \$80, this \$70 is only 87.5% of what they were promised.  
 * Result: Overall loss was 10% (promised \$100, paid \$90). Senior tranche loss was 0% (promised \$20, paid \$20). Equity tranche loss was 12.5% (promised \$80, paid \$70).

- Senior tranche has reduced risk, equity tranche increased risk
- Example of cash flow tranche or cash-flow cascade or waterfall (with  $20\%$  senior,  $80\%$  equity)

Promised CF = \$100, Actual CF = \$100  

<table><tr><td></td><td>Share of pool</td><td>$ Paid</td><td>% Paid</td></tr><tr><td>Senior Tranche</td><td>20%</td><td>\$20</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Equity Tranche</td><td>80%</td><td>\$80</td><td>100%</td></tr></table>

Promised CF = \$100, Actual CF = \$90  

<table><tr><td></td><td>Share of pool</td><td>$ Paid</td><td>% Paid</td></tr><tr><td>Senior Tranche</td><td>20%</td><td>\$20</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Equity Tranche</td><td>80%</td><td>\$70</td><td>87.5%</td></tr></table>

How do we price this? Actually very easy in this case.

- We know the price of the risky mortgages ( $100, 5\%$  yield) and the risk-free rate (4%, for risk-free cash flows)
- PV(risky mortgages) = \$100  
- PV(5% coupon @ 4% yield) = 104.4518
- The senior tranche is now risk-free so this must be priced at \$104.4518. We are selling 20% of the shares at this price, so this is $20.8904 ($104.4518*0.20). The balance we have to sell at \$79.1096 (to make the total \$100)

<table><tr><td></td><td>Share of pool</td><td>PV ($)</td><td></td><td>$ Paid</td></tr><tr><td>Senior Tranche</td><td>20%</td><td>$104.4518</td><td>→</td><td>$20.8904</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>↓</td></tr><tr><td>Equity Tranche</td><td>80%</td><td>$98.8870</td><td>←</td><td>$79.1096</td></tr></table>

Details for pricing of "mortgage bond"

- 5-year, 5% annual coupon, \$100 bullet re-payment (not amortizing like a true mortgage).  
- Chance that  $10\%$  of mortgages will fail to repay principal  
- Price \$100, so yield (risky yield) 5%  
- Risk-free rate \(4 \%\) , so risk-free bond PV(5yr bond, \(5 \%\) coupon, \(4 \%\) yield) = \\(104.4518  
 - Assume that all coupons paid with certainty, 10% of principal will default with some probability (either no-default and get \$100, or yes-default at year 5 and get \$90)  
- Use risk-neutral (risk-adjusted) pricing:

$$
\begin{array}{l} PV (r i s k y 5 \% c o u o n @ 4 \% r i s k - f r e e) \\ = P V (\$ 5 a n n u i t y @ 4 \%) + (1 - \phi) \cdot P V (\$ 100 @ 4 \%) + \phi \cdot P V (\$ 90 @ 4 \%) \\ \end{array}
$$

Implies (risk-neutral) probability of default is  $\phi = 54.16\%$

- PV of tranched risky bond with recovery  $87.5\%$  (using risk-neutral pricing):

$$
\begin{array}{l} PV(\text{tranched} 5\% \text{couon} @ 4\% \text{risk} - \text{free}) \\ = P V (\$ 5 a n n u i t y @ 4 \%) + (1 - \phi) \cdot P V (\$ 100 @ 4 \%) + \phi \cdot P V (\$ 87.5 @ 4 \%) \\ \end{array}
$$

Bond is tranched  $20\%$  senior,  $80\%$  equity:

Asset Classes - Equity

Remember our "Asset Classes": Equity is one of the big ones

# Asset Class Comparison (US)

Remember the different asset classes we discussed

Focusing on Equity Market now - compare US Bond & Equity

Each one is huge, relative to annual GDP  

- Bond Market bigger than Equity (plus Money Markets)  
- Bonds: \$41.0 trn (21%)  
Equity: \$30 trn (155%)  
 GDP (flow): \$19.39 trn

Bond market larger but Equity market better-known

- Anybody (& everybody) can trade equities  
- In the news every day (Dow Jones, S&P)

# 2.2 What is a Firm?

# Contents

What is a Firm? Seems We Know - But More Complicated

This seems like a silly question - everyone knows what a firm is.

- Not as simple as it seems.  
- Anything from a single-member LLC to a huge firm such as GM

# General Outline of Legal Organization

- Sole Proprietorship - single individual simply running a business  
- Partnership - 2+ individuals each having liability for all debts, and profits
- Ownership cannot be separated from partners  
- Ownership not freely transferrable.
- Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)  
- as a partnership but introduces limited liability
- Limited Liability Company (LLC)
- like partnership, but legal existence outside of partners  
- ownership can be transferred, but usually not freely  
- Part way between Partnership and Corporation

Corporation

-firm" such as GM  
- separate legal existence, owned by a few or many individuals  
- free transferability of ownership
- Concept of limited liability important

# A Little History of the Corporation

- Joint-stock companies, England during 16th and 17th centuries
- created to explore and trade overseas.  
- Decision-making in hands of directors, shares freely transferable.  
- Royal charter because people were not free to travel or trade overseas
- By later 17th century businessmen figured out they could copy & make private  
- Bubble Act of 1720
- South Sea Company, a chartered corporation, convinced Parliament to ban non-chartered companies.  
- Basically, trying to put competitors out of business

* From the South Sea & Bubble Act – "bubble" for any speculative excess ("housing bubble").

- Eventually Parliament relented - Companies Act of 1844.  
- In Colonies, Bubble Act came over in 1741  
- Reformers denounced special charters,
- New era, 1837, Connecticut first state to enact all-purpose, general incorporation statute
- No special charter, just file certain factual information.  
- No governmental permission, private contract with the state as registry.
- That is the situation we are currently in

# What Actually Constitutes a Firm?

Not trivial question

- Many subtle questions here.

For now we will not go there, but pretend we know exactly what a "firm" is

- Legal entity, created and owned by individuals, that produces and sells goods or services and which acts to maximize profits

Critical - assumption of profit maximization - from this all things flow.

# WHAT IS A FIRM?

1. This seems like a silly question - everyone knows what a firm is.

(a) But when you start asking the question a little more carefully, it is not as simple as it seems. A firm can be anything from a single-member LLC (owned and operated by a single person) to a huge firm such as GM with thousands of employees and offices around the world.  
(b) General outline of legal organization of firms in the US (see, eg, state of CT form REG-1 for registering a new business) (Note that legal organization of a firm is generally under state law, so that the legal structure can vary from state-to-state, although for most major legal forms they are pretty standard across states.)

i. Sole Proprietorship - single individual simply running a business - an example might be a tailor running out of their home or a shop - and having all profits going to their income and filing taxes under their own name without any further legal structure.  
ii. Partnership - arrangement by two or more individuals with each having liability for all debts, and profits going to the partners and being split by whatever arrangement the partners agree - profits go to the individual's income and taxed under their own name. Ownership of partnership cannot be separated from partners, and partnership does not have legal existence outside of partners (ceases when a partner dies). Ownership not freely transferrable.

A. Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) - as a partnership but introduces limited liability - profits distributed to partners and taxed with their individual income - entity does not have legal existence outside of partners

iii. Limited Liability Company (LLC) - a group of people that get together and own the company with profits split by whatever owners agree - very much like a partnership, with profits usually going to individuals and being taxed as part of their personal income, but does have legal existence separate from the owners (called "managers" at least in CT) and ownership can be transferred, but usually not freely.

A. One major difference between partnership and LLC is limited liability nature of LLC. Basically, LLC was invented as a way of allowing individuals to flexibly get together, own and manage a business, without having their personal assets at risk in the company. If a partnership goes into bankruptcy, the debtors may be able to go after the personal assets (cars, bank accounts) of the partners. (But there are Limited and General partnerships.)  
B. This is a relatively new (say past 10-20 years) structure that is now recognized throughout the US.  
C. Part way between Partnership and Corporation

iv. Corporation – what we usually think of as a "firm" such as GM – owned by a few or many individuals, with free transferability of ownership, and with a legal existence separate from the individual managers or those who own its shares at a particular

point in time. A legal entity under the law, can enter into agreements under its own name.

A. Concept of limited liability - very important because it means that an owner is not liable for more than they put into the company. If you buy a share of GM you can lose all you paid for that share, but nobody can come after you to collect more.  
B. Free transferability of shares

(c) A little history of the corporation

i. Joint-stock companies in England during 16th and 17th centuries, created to explore and trade overseas. Decision-making in hands of directors, shares freely transferable. Companies had to secure a royal charter because people were not free to travel or trade overseas.

ii. By later 17th century businessmen figured out they could copy the structure of the royally-chartered companies but make them fully private.

iii. Bubble Act of 1720 - the South Sea Company, a chartered corporation, convinced Parliament to ban non-chartered companies. Basically, the South Sea Company was trying to put competitors out of business (although at the time there were myriad "bubble companies" that were purely speculative or fraudulent ventures). From the South Sea Company and the Bubble Act we get the term "bubble" to refer to any speculative excess (as in "housing bubble").

iv. In response businessmen and barristers figured out how to combine partnerships and trusts to mimic corporate structure – managerial power concentrated in a few hands and freely transferable partnership interests for others.

v. Eventually Parliament relented - Companies Act of 1844.

vi. In Colonies, Bubble Act was extended to colonies in 1741 but American promoters were able to create corporate features without incorporating. But some companies still incorporated, getting charters from the state legislature, because the charter granted monopoly or other rights.

vii. Reformers denounced special charters, and new era started in 1837 when Connecticut became first state to enact all-purpose, general incorporation statute – standardized, simplified process for creating a corporation.

A. Basically, CT said organizer no longer had to obtain special charter, just had to file certain factual information. No governmental permission required to create a corporation, it is created by private contract with the state serving as a registry.  
B. That is the situation we are currently in - states register an incorporation and generally required notification if you do business in the state (if for nothing else, for the collection of state taxes) but they do not grant permission.

2. Also, the question of what actually constitutes a specific firm is not trivial – outsourcing and the boundaries of the firm – consider a PC firm that outsources production to Taiwan, help-center services to call centers in India, accounting services to an accounting firm, and office cleaning services to a local service company. Does the computer "firm" include the manufacturing and help-center, or are those market purchased goods and services. Many subtle questions here.  
3. For now we will not go there, but pretend we know exactly what a "firm" is - a legal entity, created and owned by individuals, that produces and sells goods or services and which acts to maximize profits.

(a) This excludes entities such as the UK's National Health Service run by the government or a local charity. But it includes a huge, and hugely important, section of what is done in our society.  
(b) Critical - assumption of profit maximization - from this all things flow.

# 2.3 What is Common Stock or Equity?

# Contents

# Common Stock, Shares, Equity - Same Thing

Part ownership of a firm. Three important characteristics:

1. limited liability,  
- cannot lose more than you put in  
2. residual cash flow  
- get to keep whatever is left over  
3. control or ownership  
- Technically shareholders own and control the company  
- Practically delegate to board of directors and the managers

# Common Stock or Equity

Common stock, shares, equity, are all names for the ownership.

Three important characteristics -

1. limited liability,

- cannot lose more than you put in. Can always just walk away. This is simple to say but has very important implications. We'll see in talking about financial distress and agency issues that the limited liability of shareholders can lead to some very interesting games being played between shareholders and debtholders.  
2. residual cash flow,  
- get to keep whatever is left over after workers, suppliers, debtholders, etc. are all paid. In other words, get the company profits. A publicly-traded share is just a proportionate share in the profits. If there are 100 shares out there, each share gets  $\frac{1}{100}$  of the profits. If 1mn shares, each share gets  $\frac{1}{1mn}$  of the profits.  
3. control or ownership  
- more complicated issue than residual CF. Technically shareholders own and control the company, but as a practical issue for most publicly traded companies there are so many shareholders, with ownership so widely distributed, that control is delegated to a board of directors and the managers. We'll have much more to say about this later.

Let's look at Honeywell international and discuss some of the institutional characteristics of equity. Start with book value of common stockholder's equity (table 14.2 in BMA).

<table><tr><td>Common shares (\$1 par value per share)</td><td>958</td></tr><tr><td>Additional paid-in capital</td><td>\$3,994</td></tr><tr><td>Retained earnings</td><td>\$16,250</td></tr><tr><td>Treasury shares</td><td>-\$14,015</td></tr><tr><td>Net common equity</td><td>\$7,187</td></tr><tr><td>NOTE:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Authorized shares</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Issued shares, of which</td><td>958</td></tr><tr><td>Outstanding</td><td>735</td></tr><tr><td>Treasury shares</td><td>223</td></tr></table>

Actually, to my mind, most of this is pretty useless to anyone but lawyers and accountants

- Number of shares - From legal perspective, this provides some information. Articles of incorporation or bylaws state how many shares may be issued. Mainly a legal and documentation issue - authorized shares usually set at some high number so don't have to go back and get a new board resolution or shareholders meeting just to issue new shares. For Honeywell, 2bn shares authorized, but only  $958\mathrm{mn}$  have been issued.  
- Outstanding vs. Treasury Shares - Treasury shares are shares that have been issued but later bought back by the company. We'll talk about share repurchases shortly and we'll see that this share repurchases is a very common way of returning money to stockholders nowadays. For Honeywell there are 735mn shares outstanding. This is the only worthwhile number from here - we need to know the number of shares to calculate the market value (MV of Equity = # shares outstanding * price per share)  
- The value information at the top is pretty meaningless.
- The value of "Common Shares" (\$958mn) is meaningless for two reasons. First, it is value at par of \$1/share – par value is nothing but a legal fiction – for historical legal reasons shares usually have to be given some value in the articles of incorporation, and values such as \$1 or 1 cent are commonly chosen. Second, it includes all shares issued, including Treasury shares that have been repurchased.

– "Additional paid-in capital" is the additional capital (above the par value \$958mn) raised from selling shares. This might mean something except that it's book value – value at time shares were issued and not current market value  

- Retained earnings – the additional equity raised by retaining profits and not paying them out to shareholders.  
- Treasury shares - this is the amount the firm paid out to repurchase the Treasury shares.  
- Note that the equity created by net profits retained (the net of retained earnings less Treasury shares) is, for Honeywell, almost half the equity created by newly issued equity. i.e. retained earnings is a very important way of creating new equity.
- The final value, "Net common equity" of \(7,187, is pretty meaningless. It is the sum of historical values and may have little relation to market values.  
- The original equity (par value plus additional paid-in capital) could have been issued 50 years ago. If Honeywell invested in good projects and the firm grew, that original equity would have grown substantially.  
- In fact, the  \$7,187mn implies, for 735mn shares, a value of\$ 9.78/share. In December 2008 the actual value was more like \$35.

To repeat, about the only valuable information from that table is the 735mn outstanding shares.

- Simply Shares * Price

Float

- Shares available to the public  
- Excludes "restricted" shares, owned by executives, cannot be freely sold

# Ownership and Voting

Equity ownership implies company ownership

- In practice, ownership so widely distributed equity holders do not make management decisions  
- Control is delegated to professional managers  
- Different for small companies

For large public corporations, common stockholders' right of control limited to voting for appointments to the board of directors

- The board acts as the stockholders' representatives  
- Managers are, in theory, responsible to stockholders through the board

# Voting

- Many stockholders don't vote  
- Some investors specialize in buying shares and pressuring companies to make changes. Called activist shareholders.  
Majority vs. Cumulative Voting

Ownership and Voting - equity ownership implies company ownership

- Generally owning the equity of the firm means owning the firm itself - the right to residual profits and the right to control.  
- In practice, for public companies in developed countries share ownership is so widely distributed that equity holders do not make direct management decisions.  
- By-and-large, control is delegated to professional managers
- Note that this will not be true for small companies. A small company will usually have the owners also be the managers. For example, the hedge fund I started and ran for a number of years was owned by three of us (we held the shares, until we sold a percentage to an outside fund) and running and managing the firm was also our full time jobs.
- In practice, for large public corporations, common stockholders' right of control is limited to the right to vote for appointments to the board of directors and some crucial matters (such as mergers, changes in articles of incorporation or bylaws).  
- The board acts as the stockholders' representatives and managers are, in theory, responsible to stockholders through the board.  
- We will talk more about the board and corporate governance later.  
Voting

- Many stockholders don't vote - feel they own so few shares it doesn't matter  
- Some investors specialize in buying shares (often concentrating on single companies and buying large blocks) and pressuring companies to make changes – in other words actively exercising their ownership rights. Called activist shareholders.  
Majority vs. Cumulative Voting  
- Majority - each director voted separately, and one vote per share per director  
- Cumulative - still get one vote per share per director but can cumulate votes and apply all to a single director. This makes it easier for activist investors to have an impact, and thus some shareholder groups campaign for cumulative voting.

# Dual-class shares and minority rights

Residual cash flow and control rights might not go together.

- Two classes of shares, identical in CF rights but different voting rights.  
- More common in Europe than in the US, but it does happen - Google

Minority rights - a touchy problem.

- Majority shareholders may try to deprive minority shareholders of cash or rights.  
Example: Russian company

Dual-class shares and minority rights

It is not necessary that residual cash flow and control rights go together. Sometimes there are two classes of shares, identical in their rights to cash flows but with different voting rights. This tends to be more common in Europe than in the US, but it does happen – the book cites Google, whose owners created two share classes to enable them to retain control over the company when they first issued shares to the public.

Minority rights - a touchy problem. Problem that majority shareholders may exercise their majority ownership rights to deprive minority shareholders of cash or rights.

Book cites example of a Russian company where the majority defrauded minority shareholders – majority shareholder created 1 share out of every 136,000 existing shares. Minority shareholders had fewer than 136,000, so they got paid off at par – as we saw above this is often far below market value.

These kind of games are generally not allowed in developed countries – but then Russia is a wild place to do business. The government closed Yukos (former large oil company). The story of Yukos and Khodorkovsky is pretty amazing. The Russian tax authorities claimed they owed \$28bn in taxes – a pretty ridiculous number given revenue and taxes paid by other oil companies. Seems politically-motivated – government expropriation of assets. Assets were bought at auction for \$9.4bn in December 2004 (about half of what they'd been estimated a few months earlier). The company that bought (Baikalfinansgrup) was incorporated only a few days earlier and at an address occupied by a snack bar, and there were no competing bids. Baikalfinansgrup was acquired shortly afterward by Rosneft, the state-owned oil company. In all, very shady dealings.

# Preferred Equity

Not large for most companies, but important idea

Tiering or cascade of cash flows:

- First to debt-holders. These payments are required, not paying means default  
Second to preferred stockholders  
- Only third to common shareholders

# Preferred Equity

- Not large for most companies, but important idea  
- Still equity, in that no promise of payment, but actually somewhat intermediate between debt and common equity.
- Like debt, amount of payments set up-front, but like equity company can choose not to pay a preferred dividend still not be in default - preferred dividend not a fixed promise  
- But most preferred issues are cumulative preferred stock which requires any past missed preferred dividends be made up before any common dividends can be paid.  
- Thus we have a tiering or cascade of cash flows:

* First to debt-holders. These payments are required, not paying means default  
* Second to preferred stockholders.
* Only third to common shareholders.

- This cash flow cascading is taken much further in structured products such as CDOs and CMOs. These take existing securities and slice up the cash flows in various ways to change the risk / return characteristics of resulting new securities.
- For various reasons company profits are not sliced up so finely among various securities, but the cascading and slicing between debt, preferred, and common shows some of this.

* Why don't company cash flows get sliced up so finely? I think main reason has to do with asymmetric information and contracts. For CDOs and CMOs the amount of cash generated by the securities behind the CDO or CMO can be observed and verified easily by everyone, both buyers and sellers. The cash just has to be sliced up according to the pre-set rules. For a corporation, however, there can be substantial uncertainty about the actual profits in any quarter or year. There could be incentives for the owners to lie about the level of CF. Thus just very simple structures, with debt getting promised payment, then whatever is left over going to equity (common and preferred). Easy to monitor if interest is paid on the debt, and severe penalties (default and bankruptcy) if not.

STOCKS (largely from Sharpe, ch 17):

1. Corporate Form

(a) What is a corporation anyway?  
(b) Stock certificates, voting, proxy fight, takeovers, ownership vs control, stockholders' equity

2. Dividends

(a) Cash dividends vs cash dividends (they're really the same)  
(b) Stock splits are nothing

3. Issuing new stock

(a) General Cash Offering (US) vs Preemptive rights (UK, Europe)
