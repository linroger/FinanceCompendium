# Primary vs Secondary Markets - Issuing vs Investing

Primary Market - Issuers raise money by Issuing Securities

- Issuers:

Corporations / Companies: manufacturers, banks, retail firms  

- Governments: US Federal, US state & local, Non-US (only bonds)
- Issue to: Investors (see below)  
Securities (Assets): either equities or bonds

SecondaryMarket - Investors invest and adjust savings and retirement

- Investors
- Individuals  
- Pensions funds (private companies, government retirement and health funds)  
- Mutual funds, hedge funds  
Insurance Companies

- Investors also invest in primary market, but secondary market more active

# Primary Markets - Issuing

Issuers raise money by Issuing Securities

More details shortly on "Type of Market"

Most securities "brokered" - managed by investment bank

- Auction: US Treasuries always; equities rarely

# Some details:

- Equities and bonds usually issued through brokered market, with an investment bank acting as broker.  
- We will cover more detail about how equities are issued shortly  
- US Government bonds are issued through an auction mechanism – the US Treasury provides a list of what securities are being issued, and primary dealers then give prices they would buy at, until all securities are sold  
- State and local bonds, corporate bonds, foreign bonds (such as bonds issued by Brazil in the international market) are all brokered by commercial or investment banks

# Remember US Treasuries Issued - Auction

Col 1: Announcement Date - new issues trade When Issued (WI)  
Col 2: Auction Date - coupon set, trade normally

Col 3: Settle Date - cash & bonds change hands (normally  $\mathrm{T} + 1$ )

Thursday Apr 2 2020 was a busy day:

- Bunch of bills issued  
- New 3-yr note issued  
10-yr note and 30-yr bond re-opened

# Secondary Market: Markets, Investors, Securities

Secondary Market: major locus or venue for investors to save and invest

Structure for how securities traded - US markets specifically but similar world-wide

- Types of markets: Brokered, Dealer, Auction  
- Investors: who they are and how they access the market  
Securities: Broadly how different securities are traded

Diagram provides framework

- Much detail packed in  
- More detail in my "notes"

Types of Markets

- Direct Search
- Something like Craigslist or advertising for a used car  
- individual buyers and sellers seeking each other directly.  
- One-off transaction and products tend to be heterogeneous (each different) - no economies of scale in specializing

# Brokered

- A person or company specializes in bringing together buyers and sellers  
- Could be either illiquid and heterogeneous or liquid and homogeneous

* BKM give example of real estate. But this is still very illiquid (irregular) and heterogeneous  
* Many financial markets are brokered, but liquid and homogeneous – Swaps are liquid and homogeneous

- Brokered markets generally have a fee or commission - the buyer or seller (or both) pay a fee to the broker

Example: Swaps

# Dealer

- Dealer specializes in trading a specific security or asset or type of asset  
- Buys and sells for own account - will buy from a customer and sell to a customer directly, not arranging a transaction with another customer
- Stands ready to buy from or sell to customer  
- Buys from customer at low price (Bid) and sells at high price (offer)  
- Example: Bonds, FX

# Auction

- Buyers and sellers get together in centralize exchange  
- Used to be a physical location, now electronic  
- Examples: NY Stock Exchange, CME futures exchange - Movie "Trading Places" has scene of pit (auction) trading in Orange Juice futures

# How Investors Buy and Sell

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/cda0f23d-ff5d-4f20-bae2-7d01d7e8f6a6/0107ad99aa20179f01a4983ef152a3df074d660f9baac8420a15a9188004bb16.jpg)

Investors will buy and sell for many reasons

- Long-term investment
- Retirement  
- Future spending (saving for children's education, looking after one's parents)

# - Short-term cash

Corporations or individuals or governments may have cash now that they will use some short period in the future, need to invest somewhere for short period.  

- May put it in a bank, but could also buy a bond or equity for a short period

Investors almost always go through a broker, broker/dealer, or bank

- Individuals, corporations, retirement or mutual funds will almost never deal in the market directly but have a broker act on their behalf  
- A broker would be someone like Interactive Brokerage, Vanguard Broker Services, Fidelity, E*Trade, Charles Schwab
- The most basic allow you to buy and sell equities. More sophisticated will provide services in equities, bonds, FX, futures. Domestic and international.
- The broker will execute in the appropriate market on behalf of the investor

# Equity Markets (Primary vs Secondary)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/cda0f23d-ff5d-4f20-bae2-7d01d7e8f6a6/995a67c503bdf2a336242dee77aae8c7047d431916a5ce91a655222a4d4de29e.jpg)

# Secondary Market: Auction, with commission

Distinguish between Primary (where companies issue new securities) and Secondary (where investors invest in securities already issued).

- Primary (we will discuss next section)
- Companies issue the securities and raise the money from investors  
- Almost always brokered, with an investment bank handling the details of required regulatory filings, pricing, finding investors, etc.

Secondary market

- The original company is not involved  
- Investors buy and sell the securities to invest and re-arrange their investments – to manage their portfolio  
- For large public equities (Apple, IBM, Starbucks) it is auction market – buyers and sellers meet and negotiate price and quantity. e.g. NY Stock Exchange  
- For small, privately issued securities it may be a brokered or dealer market

Bond (and FX) Markets  
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/cda0f23d-ff5d-4f20-bae2-7d01d7e8f6a6/c488abea6e7027eb25b8b07e254a8608deffe8a223303d7638abcea6a93bad5f.jpg)  
Dealer market, with dealer earning Bid/Offer spread (buy low bid price, sell high offer price) rather than commission

Bond (and FX) markets virtually always dealer market

- Banks, investment banks, and confusingly often called brokers – buy and sell themselves,  
- Stand ready to buy from and sell to customers.
- Dealer chooses the price - will buy low (Bid Price) and sell high (Offer or Ask Price)

# 2 How Corporations Issue Equity

# 2.1 Overview & Early Stage

# Contents

Ch. 15 of [Brealey et al.(2013)Brealey, Myers, and Allen] is more about equity funding than about issuing securities. Refers almost entirely to equity issues. We will go over this briefly. We don't have time to cover this in detail, but BMA is good so you can read to get detail

# Three Stages of Equity Funding

1. Venture Capital or Angel Investors and private funding - not publicly traded securities  
2. IPO - Initial Public Offering - the first sale of securities to the public for a firm not publicly traded  
3. SEO - Seasoned Equity Offering - sale of securities to the public for an existing publicly-traded firm

# Private Funding, Angel Investors, and Venture Capital

Can be simple - raise funds from small, non-public, group - no public securities

- At the simplest level this is family and friends.  
- Other outside investors often called Angel Investors  
- For a small start-up not necessary, but often good idea, to formalize with articles of incorporation and by-laws  
- Such formality necessary when money from outside enters.

Venture Capital:

Equity provided by outside investors  

- In the form of shares that are not publicly traded

# Private Funding, Angel Investors, and Venture Capital

Very simple - raise funds from small, non-public, group - no public securities

- At the simplest level this is family and friends.  
- The hedge fund I started in London fell into this category - the three founders put up the original equity. We got shares proportional to funds we put in.  
- Other outside investors are often called Angel Investors  
- For a small start-up it is not necessary, but it is often a very good idea, to formalize arrangements with articles of incorporation and by-laws that specify shares and how they can be traded, redeemed, etc. This saves many headaches later. It is, ironically, most important when things go really well. Fights really start when there's lots of money to fight over – if things go badly and everyone loses money it's bad luck but there tends to be less spoils to fight over.  
- Such formality becomes an absolute necessity when money from outside friends and family enters. Venture Capital is equity provided by outside investors, but in the form of shares that are not publicly traded.

# Venture Capital Investors

Firms that provide funding to young and start-up companies.

- Focus on companies that have a chance to grow spectacularly - next Google, Apple, …

VC often second stage, after founders put their own money in

- Need additional equity to continue or expand

VC investors generally pay close attention

- Require strict and formal agreements

VC investor shares not publicly traded, don't have to be registered with SEC

Venture Capital Investors

- Term used to describe firms that provide funding to young and start-up companies. VC investors focus on companies that have a chance to grow spectacularly. VC investors are constantly looking out for the next Microsoft, Amazon, or Google. But VC not limited just to technology business.
- VC investment is often a second stage, after the founders have put their own money in and when they need additional equity to continue or expand.  
- With my hedge fund we had a 2nd stage investor. We started our company in 1998, then in 2001/02 we wanted to expand and we found a large hedge fund willing to invest in us. We didn't call it VC, but it had all the characteristics we're talking about here - selling a share of the company to a new investor who was closely involved in out firm.  
- VC investors will generally pay close attention to the firm – not a hands-off investment. Require strict and formal agreements, specifying conditions to be met, further funding parameters, etc. Generally requires a seat on the board or a say in the management.  
- Shares sold to VC investors will not be publicly traded, and don't have to be registered with SEC.

# Selling Shares to VC

- Injects new capital  
- Dilutes existing shareholders  
- Sets value on company

Example of "Marvin Enterprises"

- Initial investment (founders): \$100,000 for 1mn shares  
 2nd stage VC firm Meriam Venture Partners \$1mn,

- 1mn shares at \$1 each.

Now the firm was 50/50 owned by founders and Meriam - 1mn shares each

Balance sheet after 2nd stage financing

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>Cash from new equity</td><td>$1mn</td><td>$1mn</td><td>New equity from VC</td></tr><tr><td>Other assets, mostly intangible</td><td>$1mn</td><td>$1mn</td><td>Original equity, held by entrepreneurs</td></tr><tr><td>Value</td><td>$2mn</td><td>$2mn</td><td>Value</td></tr></table>

Selling shares to VC Investors sets value on company, and sets value of existing shares

Example of "Marvin Enterprises"

- Initial investment was  \$100,000 for\$ 1mn shares.  
 - 2nd stage investment from VC firm Meriam Venture Partners was \$1mn, in the form of 1mn shares at \$1 each.  
- Note that now the firm was 50/50 owned by founders and Meriam 
- 1mn shares each

# 2.2 IPOs

# Contents

# Initial Public Offerings

This is where we, the public, get involved.

- Also regulations and legal issues

As a result of the last-but-one financial crisis (1929-33, not 2008-2009) regulations and institutions enacted to protect investors

Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act" - SEC)  

- State "blue sky" laws (state-by-state regulations governing offering of securities)

fraudulent investments backed by nothing but so many feet of blue sky

SEC and Securities Act

- "Registration" of securities that are offered to the public  
- Disclosure and transparency. No ruling that security is "good"

# IPOs - Initial Public Offerings - first offer of securities to the public

This is where we, the public, start to get involved. It is also where regulations and legal issues become very important

- As a result of the last financial crisis (the 1929-33 Depression, not the 2008-2009 crises) there was a whole set of regulations and institutions enacted to protect investors. There are two particularly important sets of regulations that govern issuance and trading of securities in the US:

Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act" - SEC)  

- State "blue sky" laws (state-by-state regulations governing offering of securities)

SEC and Securities Act

- This is the big one.
- The SEC requires "registration" of securities that are offered to the public.

* There are some exceptions if a small number of knowledgeable or sophisticated investors (35 or less). These are called Reg D offerings (offered under Regulation D). They can sometimes be traded among large financial institutions under Rule 144A.

- The idea behind registration is to provide disclosure and transparency. The SEC has nothing to say about whether the security offering is "good" in the sense of a good investment, only that the offering discloses all relevant information.  
- This is an incredibly important point. The SEC makes no ruling on the quality of the investment. You can never get in trouble with the SEC for a stupid start-up idea. But the SEC insists on disclosing all relevant and material information. When you hear about someone getting in trouble with the SEC it is often on failure to disclose material information. (The SEC also goes after outright fraud, but we'll put that to the side for the moment - assume that everyone here is basically honest and not out to pull a Madoff-type Ponzi scheme.)

# Main Steps in Traditional IPO

1. Company appoints underwriters  
2. Fees: spread (typically  $7\%$ ) and gumshoe option (underwriters can get additional  $15\%$  shares)  
3. Prepare SEC registration and issue preliminary prospectus (red herring)  
4. Roadshow to market to potential customers. Build book by soliciting indications of interest  
5. SEC approval (SEC rules on disclosure, not quality of the issue). Company and underwriters agree on issue price  
6. Underwriters allocate shares (usually over-allocation)  
7. Trading starts. Underwriters cover the over-allocation by buying in the market and exercising gumshoe option  
8. Managing underwriter makes liquid market in stock and provides research coverage

# SEC registration and state blue-sky laws

- An incredibly cumbersome and legalistic process that produces a document that nobody except lawyers read.  
- But the benefit of this process is that it requires any new issuer to disclose material information, and provides severe (and well-enforced) penalties if relevant information is not disclosed. This is one of those situations where nobody reads the registration document, but its existence ensures good behavior.  
- The most important part of the registration statement is the Prospectus. Very much shortened example in appendix to Ch. 15.  
- Also must ensure offering complies with state laws – blue-sky laws that regulate offering and sale of securities within a state.  
- Generally, but not always, if comply under federal securities regulation will also comply under state laws. But not always - example of Apple IPO in 1980 when Mass regulators didn't allow sales to individuals in Mass because Apple was too risky. Stupid, but there you go.  
- Historically, state and federal laws had duplication. Much duplication, particularly on securities registration, removed in 1996.
- Term "blue-sky" refers to fraudulent investments that are backed by nothing but so many feet of blue sky.

# Underwriting, Road Show, and Bookbuilding

- Most IPOs in the US are done as underwritten issues under the following process:
- Company chooses a set of investment banks as underwriters who agree to buy the shares from the company at a pre-agreed price, and then sell them to the public.  
- The underwriters agree to support the price in the market for a period of time by buying shares back from the public.
- Once the registration statement has been submitted to the SEC (but before approval) the underwriters will go on a Road Show, talking to potential investors  
- Investors provide indications of interest where they say how many shares they will buy at what price.  
- The process of collecting indications and allocation shares is called Bookbuilding.  
- Managing underwriter commits to make liquid market and provide research coverage.

# Price Setting and Sale

SEC approval, the underwriters set price and allocate shares

- Price is usually set at a discount to where everyone thinks it will actually sell  
- Strong incentive to ensure the issues sell  
- Shares on IPOs usually rise from. Price rises sometimes substantial

Why? Why use such a cumbersome process and leave so much money on the table?

- Google in 2004 raised \$1.4bn in an auction.  
- Why don't others?

I don't have a good answer.

- But, I want to be careful - maybe I don't know enough

Many IPOs involve founders selling a small number of their own shares to the public

- May be a private incentive for the founders: raise less money for the firm, increase private wealth

# Price Setting and Sale

- When SEC approval is obtained, the underwriters set a price and allocate shares to investors at that price.
- Price is usually set at a discount to where everyone thinks it will actually sell  
- Strong incentive on the part of the investment banks to ensure the issues sell - both for their own reputation and so they don't get stuck with unsold shares - remember they've underwritten the issue and bought the shares from the company at the pre-agreed price so the risk resides with the investment bank.
- They then sell shares to the public.  
- Shares on IPOs almost invariably rise from their offer price, at least initially. These prices rises can be really substantial
- This raises an important question - why use such a cumbersome process, that seems to ensure underpricing and that the firm will raise less money than they could have if they had offered the shares to the public in an auction.
- Google in 2004 raised \$1.4bn in an auction.  
- Why don't others?  
- I don't have a good answer. Seems to me the existing process is rife with inefficiencies and conflicts-of-interest. Note that managing underwriter provides research as part of the package, but how can the research be independent when it is part of the IPO package?  
- But, I want to be careful - I don't have enough experience and knowledge about IPOs to make a definitive statement. There may be issues around asymmetric information and signaling (the issuers have information that the public cannot have, and under-pricing may provide some signal about the quality of the issue). Efficient markets actually require people to put in time and effort to uncover information and set prices, and there is some evidence that the bookbuilding process is better at building information than an auction.  
- Also, many IPOs involve founders selling a small number of their own shares to the public and holding onto most of their shares, so that there may be a private incentive for the founders to raise less money for the firm but have their own wealth (in terms of continued holdings of shares) increase.

# 2.3 Secondary Offerings - Seasoned Equity Offer or SEO

# Contents

General Cash Offers vs Rights Offers

Seasoned Equity Offer or SEO

US: General Cash Offers – that is sale to everyone and anyone

- Essentially same as IPO - underwriter, SEC registration, underwriter roadshow and book-building, …  
- Same problems with underpricing and conflicts-of-interest as with IPO.  
- Shelf registration - important innovation - SEC's Rule 415

Additional problem - asymmetric information, overpricing, and announcement effect

- The issuing firm has better information than outsiders.  
- Bottom line - firms will issue shares when "too high"  
- Investors know this. Issue signals prospects poor  
- Result: Companies don't issue, and if they do price falls

Alternative to General Cash Offer - Rights Offer

Rarely in US, always overseas  

- Gives existing shareholders the right of first refusal.
- Each shareholder given right to buy new shares - "rights"

Seasoned Issues - Seasoned Equity Offer or SEO

- In the US most SEOs are done as General Cash Offers – that is sale to everyone and anyone.
- Process is essentially the same as for IPO - underwriter, SEC registration, underwriter roadshow and bookbuilding, underwriter buys shares from company at agreed price and sells to public.
- Same problems with underpricing and conflicts-of-interest as with IPO.
- Shelf registration - important innovation - SEC's Rule 415 allows a single registration that applies over a period for a range of offerings. Allows flexibility and lower cost - don't have to register each time.
- Additional problem - asymmetric information, overpricing, and announcement effect
- The issuing firm has better information than outsiders.
- If the firm has information that future prospects are better than the market believes, the share price will be "too low" - lower than it should be if the market knew the better future prospects. In such a case the firm will not want to issue shares because they will raise less than they should, and the low price will favor new shareholders and hurt existing shareholders (the new shareholders get the shares at a bargain price) NB - Rights offer will solve problem of disadvantageing existing shareholders (since rights given to existing shareholders, and they can sell the rights) but will not solve the asymmetric information (share underpricing) issue.
- The firm could try and inform investors - make an announcement that future prospects are good. But investors will not believe this because it is the kind of thing firms say all the time.
- If the firm has information that future prospects are worse than the market believes, the price will be "too high" - higher than it should be, and the firm will want to issue.
- Bottom line - firms will issue shares when they have information (not available to or not correctly understood by outsiders) that the share price is "too high". Investors will know this and thus any equity issue will be interpreted as a signal that prospects are worse than embedded into the current price. Result - the price will fall in response to a new equity issue.

# Alternative to General Cash Offer - Rights Offer

- Rights Offers almost never used in the US, but almost always used (sometimes legally required) overseas.  
- Rights issues give existing shareholders the right of first refusal. Each existing shareholder is given the right to buy a certain number of new shares per existing share
- Example in BMA [Brealey et al.(2013)Brealey, Myers, and Allen] of mining company Xstrata. Each existing share given the right to buy two new shares.
- Key thing here is that rights are priced and can be sold, either to other investors or back to the underwriter.  
- Two effects
- Existing shareholders get value even if current price "too low". Protected from the market's underpricing because they have the right to the new shares. This removes the problem if new issues disadvantageing (diluting) existing shareholders.
- Price for the new shares doesn't really matter - since existing shareholders have the right to buy at that price they don't lose if the price is set below the current price. Existing shareholders can either buy the new shares, or sell the rights - either way they are equally well off.
- Can calculate new share price by considering total value (original + new cash) and dividing by new shares. Rights price is difference
- Example - Xstrata.
- Firm wants to raise 4.1bn (pounds). Current stock price is 6.23/share, 976,190 shares  
- They could set various combinations of Price New and N Rights (Price New is the price per share for the new shares, and N Rights is the number of rights given to each existing share - each Right can buy one new share) as long as Pnew*Nrights*Nshares = total amount to raise  
- For example, they actually set  $\mathrm{Pnew} = 2.10$  and  $\mathrm{Nrights} = 2$ . Then  $2.10^{*}2^{*}976,190 = 4.1\mathrm{bn}$ . Could also set  $\mathrm{Pnew} = 4.20$ ,  $\mathrm{Nrights} = 1$ . Then  $4.20^{*}1^{*}976,190 = 4.1\mathrm{bn}$ . Or  $\mathrm{Pnew} = 1.4$ ,  $\mathrm{Nrights} = 3$ , and  $1.4^{*}3^{*}976,190 = 4.1\mathrm{bn}$  
- New share price:  
* Total Value: Old + New = 6.23 + 2*2.10 = 10.43.  
* This is 3 shares, so each share worth 3.48.  
* Rights: New Price - Price Paid = 3.48 - 2.10 = 1.38.

- Existing shareholder is equally well-off if take up offer or sell rights:
