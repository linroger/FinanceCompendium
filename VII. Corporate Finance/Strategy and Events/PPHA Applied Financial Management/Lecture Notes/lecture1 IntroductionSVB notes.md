# Introduction & Big Ideas Silicon Valley Bank

Lecture 1

Thomas S. Coleman

March 20th, Draft March 19, 2023

# The Power & Value of Finance

A million [pounds] in the hands of a single banker is a great power … But the same sum scattered in tens and fifties through a whole nation is no power at all (Walter Bagehot 1873)

The Economist correctly claims that finance is one of mankind's greatest inventions:

What is mankind's greatest invention? … [People] are unlikely to suggest … the financial contract. Widely disliked and often considered grubby, it has nonetheless played an indispensable role in human development for at least 7,000 years.

… finance … can act as an economic time machine, helping savers transport today's surplus income into the future, or giving borrowers access to future earnings now. (2017)

Finance: re-arranging money & resources (cash flows) across time & people

- We see power of finance when it goes wrong: crises like 2008

Finance is about money and resources, and re-arranging cash flows across time and across people.

Walter Bagehot understood the power of finance:

A million [pounds] in the hands of a single banker is a great power … But the same sum scattered in tens and fifties through a whole nation is no power at all ([?], Lombard Street 1873)

and The Economist correctly claims that finance is one of mankind's greatest inventions:

What is mankind's greatest invention? Ask people this question and they are likely to pick familiar technologies such as printing or electricity. They are unlikely to suggest an innovation that is just as significant: the financial contract. Widely disliked and often considered grubby, it has nonetheless played an indispensable role in human development for at least 7,000 years.

… finance … can act as an economic time machine, helping savers transport today's surplus income into the future, or giving borrowers access to future earnings now. ([?])

# Problems & Study Groups

Problems assigned and due roughly weekly

- First problem set (easy) due Thursday, cover in Friday TA sessions  
- Thereafter, due Monday. Work in groups

Study groups - we will assign groups on Friday

- 3 or 4 people in your group  
- Work together & hand in a single write-up (after Problem 1)  
- Everyone in a study group gets the same grade. As in a business situation, general presentation are important.

You decide on how split the work

- Control shirking and divide the work so you all learn  
- If you work on the problems and understand them, you should be able to pass the exams; if you do not work on the problems, you will probably not pass the exams.

# You Need A Calculator

I strongly recommend the HP 17BII+ (not absolutely necessary - if you know how to use another calculator)

- Improves on the classic HP 12C by doing corporate and eurobonds in addition to US Treasuries.  
- The TVM functions are the same (only faster).

Here are some choices:

- The actual calculator, on-line at Amazon for somewhere between  $30 &$ 90. Very retro.  
- iPhone and iPad app: \$9.99: Search for "hp 17BII" and you will find the "hp 17BII-Pro" made by "r.l.m. software" - they also make an "RLM-17BX" but I have the 17BII-Pro
- Also http://www.rlmtools.com/iPhone/17BII/Detail.html
- Android I do not have as good suggestion - if you can find PowerOne Financial Calculator by Infinity Softworks

# 2 Big Ideas in Finance

# Contents

# Investment & Capital - They Are Throughout Economics

- Physical capital and investment  
Human capital and education  
Financial capital and investment

- What we will focus on

Always: Investing today for future returns

- The central focus for finance - transforming cash flows back and forth over time, people, risk characteristics  
Here - focus on details of investment and capital in a way we don't in other parts of economics

But central ideas very much the same

Ideas for Finance Course:

I. Investment & capital: theme throughout economics

Physical capital investment  
Human capital and education  

- Financial investment - what we will focus on  
- Really important to understand that investment & capital is a recurring theme throughout economics: investing today for future returns

# 2.1 TVM & Uncertainty - The Only Ideas in Finance

# Contents

# Only Two Ideas in Finance

I. Time Value of Money (TVM) - today vs tomorrow

Framework: Micro I Indifference Curves / Budget Lines

Concepts: PV; FV; yield, discount rate, IRR, interest rates; real vs nominal rates

Assets/Instrument: Everything - bonds, swaps, options, equities, business projects

II. Uncertainty & Risk - certain (known) vs uncertain Cash Flows

Framework: Expected utility. Different picture & mathematics

Concepts: risk premium; risk-adjusted discount rate; bond credit spreads; risk-neutral valuation and options

Assets/Instrument: Corporate bonds, options, equities

# Understand TVM & Risk - You Understand Finance

But that's an immense job - for a few reasons

- Translating from simple concepts to a complicated world  
- Consider US Treasury bonds:
- It is just TVM - but coupon dates (semi), and yield / accrued interest (Act/Act), and prices (what is "98-18+" anyway?) - Need to understand this all  
- And then there are UK bonds, and French, and corporates (with uncertain CFs)

Two big goals for this class:

I. Learning the language – for UST e.g. 98-18+ means "price of 98 + 18.5/32 per \$100 nominal of bond"  
II. Learning the instruments - how to unravel CFs

- What are bond CFs?  
- What are swap CFs?

I. There are really only two central ideas we will be working with in this course:

(A) Time Value of Money - today vs tomorrow

- For this we use the pictures from Micro I of Indifference Curves / Budget Lines  
- Concepts: PV, FV, yield and IRR, interest rates, real vs nominal rates,  
- Assets / Instruments: Everything - bonds, swaps, options, equities.

(B) Uncertainty and risk - how to value certain vs uncertain cash flows

- For this we will work with expected utility and use a different picture and mathematical foundations  
- Concepts: risk premium; risk-adjusted discount rate; bond credit spreads; certainty-equivalent; risk-neutral valuation and option valuation  
- Assets / Instruments: Corporate bonds, options, equities
- If you understood everything about these two ideas (TVM & valuing uncertain CFs) you would understand everything about finance.

II. If you understood everything about these two ideas (TVM & valuing uncertain CFs) you would understand everything about finance.

- Unfortunately, even though there are only these two underlying ideas, understanding all about them is an immense job. For a few reasons:  
- The basic ideas are simple but how they apply to the real world - how we translate them from abstract ideas to concrete applications - is infinitely complicated.
- Consider just bonds. There are US Treasury bonds – seem simple because they are as close to known (certain) CFs as we can get. So for some purposes we can ignore uncertainty and risk. But we have to learn how US Treasury bonds are structured (most have fixed coupons, paid semi-annually, but Bills pay only at maturity). And prices – what does a quote of 99-15 mean?  $(\$  99 + 15 / 32)$ There is a whole lot of practical issues and complication. And then there are foreign government bonds: British Gilts (also semi-annual, but some slight differences) and German Bunds and French OATs (annual coupons). And then we move to corporate bonds, of which there are an almost infinite variety. And those have uncertainty so we have to worry about risk and default. Fixed coupon US Corporates usually (but not always) pay semi-annually but slightly differently from US Treasuries. Floating rate bonds have a whole variety. And then US Municipal Gov't bonds.
- Much of this complication is just learning the terms and conventions:

* UST are fixed coupon, semi-annual, quoted A/A  
* Bunds and OATs are fixed coupon, annual, quoted A/A  
* US Corporates are fixed coupon, semi-annual, quoted 30/360

- You need to learn the language - what do people mean when they say "semi-annual", "A/A", or "30/360"?
- These are just code-words that tell you how big and when CFs occur, or how a price or yield gets quoted.  
- Part of this course is teaching you the special language used by people in the financial markets
- You need to unravel the sometimes complicated cash flows and structures to figure out how to apply the very simple TVM and uncertain CF ideas.
- The CFs for things like swaps and options are often complicated and confusing. You need to learn about them, and you need to learn how to read carefully to understand the contract - when and how much are the cash flows, and how likely are you to get them.  
- This is often a very difficult job. Sometimes people try to make things complicated. But sometimes the world is just complicated – instruments have to be made complicated to match the real world.

# 3 Silicon Valley Bank Crisis

# Contents

# Silicon Valley Bank - Classic Bank Crisis

We are in the middle of a classic banking crisis

- This is absolutely wonderful - for this course but not for the world

Today I am going to spend some time talking about SVB

- Also two others in the news - First Republic and Credit Suisse

These three are very different SVB

- Solvency problems that led to liquidity problems (bank run)

First Republic

- Lost money but still looks solvent  
- But depositors worried, created liquidity problem

Credit Suisse

- Poorly managed for many years - just not a very good company (maybe my biased opinion)

# What is Solvency? Liquidity? What is a Bank?

We have lot to unpack here

- What is Solvency? What is Liquidity?  
- Even more basic, What is a Bank?

Like many things in our world, the underlying ideas are very simple

- But only simple after we have learned a lot of background

Many details that can distract us

- Mark-to-Market and Held-to-Maturity vs Available-for-Sale portfolio  
- Capital ratios, deposits, bonds

But let's turn to the basic question: "What is a Bank?"

# 4 What is a Bank?

# Contents

# Bank as Lender & Money Creator

Two main purposes or activities of a bank:

I. Business like any company: raises funds and invests

- All companies raise funds by issuing equity (from shareholders) and debt (borrowing)  
- The company then uses those funds to run a business  
- Apple builds computers and smartphones. A bank makes loans, provides banking services (credit cards, ATMs), and invests

II. Creating money (liquidity)

- Money is complicated, and later we will spend some time on money  
- For now, take my word that banks "create" something we use for day-to-day transactions

Look at a simple balance sheet and we can see both of these things going on:

# Bank Balance Sheet: Business & "Money" Creation

# Look for two activities in Appelbe.companfesheet (Business and Money)

Assets: for making business profits.

- "Current" = cash + recievables. "Other" = patents, etc.?

Liabilities: where the funds come from.

- Debt - Short-term & Long-term  
Equity - from shareholders

# Silicon Valley Bank

Assets are Loans or Investments

- Loans: Traditional bank business  
- Investments: buying bonds (to earn profit)

Liabilities: where funds come from

- Mostly Deposits - loans from customers  
- Some Other (bonds issued by bank)  
Equity - from shareholders

# Apple Computers (\$bn)

<table><tr><td colspan="2">ASSETS</td><td colspan="2">LIABILITIES</td></tr><tr><td>Current Assets</td><td>135.4</td><td>154.0</td><td>ST Debt</td></tr><tr><td>Property</td><td>52.5</td><td>109.7</td><td>LT Debt</td></tr><tr><td>LT Investments</td><td>120.8</td><td>38.4</td><td>Other</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>44.0</td><td>50.7</td><td>Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>352.8</td><td>352.8</td><td>Total</td></tr></table>

# SVB 2022 (\$bn)

<table><tr><td colspan="2">ASSETS</td><td colspan="2">LIABILITIES</td></tr><tr><td>Loans</td><td>73.6</td><td>173.1</td><td>Deposits</td></tr><tr><td>Investments</td><td>125.1</td><td>22.4</td><td>Other</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>13.1</td><td>16.3</td><td>Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>211.8</td><td>211.8</td><td>Total</td></tr></table>

We can look in a simple bank balance sheet to see the two activities.

- The loan business is easy to see on the asset side - lending to business or individuals and charging a rate that's higher than the interest paid on the liability side.  
- The money business is in the banknotes / deposits.
- When this works we can use the deposits as money - they are generally accepted by other people easily and quickly.  
- Looking at the move from banknotes to deposits helps us understand

# 4.1 What are Deposits? What is Money?

# Contents

# To Understand Deposits - Think about Money

What is money? One of the hardest questions in economics

- Start with currency - pieces of paper printed by the government  
- Example: Zimbabwe 20-dollar bill
- No photo of US $ - not legal  
-Zimbabwe fun-2nd worst inflation ever

- Anyone my age has used currency  
Worked pretty well as money for many years

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/37a32ae7-5b6b-474d-be10-d56e67286a04/596f0c9878dea489c84bcd08db4f614065abd77a2938db496b8cc738ebcf8546.jpg)

# Currency is (or was) Pretty Good as Money

A piece of paper printed by the government

- Payments: very fast and easy - in 1920s when many transactions face-to-face. (Less now with buying and selling electronically)  
- Keeps value: lasts pretty well, does not "melt" like ice  
- Unit of account: need to think about this  
- Liquid: easy to buy / sell  
- Pretty good as "money" for many years

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/37a32ae7-5b6b-474d-be10-d56e67286a04/945d08a682cde1d7cd57336a56a194fd1ef5c1b8d6f55419ac34fc843e8f7663.jpg)

# More Money - Demand Deposits

- Currency good for face-to-face - not as good for distant and electronic transactions  
- Need something that can be easily stored and transferred electronically
- In the late 1800s, banks (at least in US) started issuing demand deposits
- A special type of security, a loan to a bank,  
 - Bank promises to pay back on demand and at par (1\$ for every 1\$ loaned)
- Special kind of loan, two special characteristics

I. Promise to pay back on demand & at par - $1-per-$1

II. Upon default, pay first-come - first-served

- If you're late, you get nothing  
- Strong incentive to get first in line - Bank Runs
- Very different than other loans (bonds)
- Regular bond-holders, upon default, get pro-rata share (assets divided according to payment hierarchy)
- Works nicely as money
- Transfer from one bank to another  
- Originally by paper check, now electronically

# Demand Deposits (Checking Account) - Loan to Bank

"Bank Deposits" are the checking account you and I use

- We think of it as "money" - we "put our money into the bank"

WRONG: it is a loan you and I make to the bank

- But a very special type of loan (debt)

Apple Computer (2022, $bn)

ST Debt:  $< 1\mathrm{yr}$ ; LT:  $>1\mathrm{yr}$

- Bonds or loans have a maturity  
- When default, remaining assets shared among debtors

Silicon Valley Bank (2022, $bn)

Deposit loans are day-by-day

- Can redeem at any time  
- When default, first person in line gets \$100, last gets zero

# 4.2 Liquidity, Solvency, and Inherent Instabilities in Banking

# Contents

# Use SVB to Illustrate Solvency and Liquidity Problems

Solvency: Consider SVB actual 2022 Balanceships Hypothetical "Big Loss"

Assume a big loss on Investments

- Assets down, and liabilities must match  
- "Shareholder's Equity" gets "written off"  
- Shares (equity) loses value

SVB Actual 2022 (\$bn)  

<table><tr><td colspan="2">ASSETS</td><td colspan="2">LIABILITIES</td></tr><tr><td>Loans</td><td>73.6</td><td>173.1</td><td>Deposits</td></tr><tr><td>Investments</td><td>125.1</td><td>22.4</td><td>Other</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>13.1</td><td>16.3</td><td>Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>211.8</td><td>211.8</td><td>Total</td></tr></table>

With "Big Loss" SVB is barely solvent (almost insolvent or "in default")

- Insolvency (default) means not enough assets to pay back debtors  
- In this example, just barely solvent (assets just more than debts)

In this case debtors are (mostly) depositors

Now in a very delicate position, with both Solvency Risks and Liquidity Risks Solvency Risk

Depositors worried investments may go down more

- Regular debts (like for Apple) cannot withdraw early  
- Deposits can, and rational to do so  
Get out now, before things get worse

# Liquidity Risk

Even if knew for sure assets would not go down

- Assets may be illiquid - take a few months or year to sell off  
- Depositors may need money back sooner  
Rational to get first in line, take money out now

In either case, depositors will likely withdraw and the bank will likely fail

- Bank will not have enough liquid assets (cash) to pay depositors

# Fundamental Issue: Banking Inherently Unstable

- The fact that deposits can be redeemed at any time makes banks inherently unstable

Here are some things which can reduce some of the risks:

I. Solvency: Be extremely transparent and up-to-date in value of assets (so everyone has confidence that the balance sheet numbers are reliable)  
II. Solvency: Carefully manage the interest rate risk (duration mismatch) and the credit risk of assets  
III. Liquidity: Hold liquid assets (easily and quickly sold). If depositors ask for their funds, assets can be quickly sold.  
IV. Deposits: Find deposits that are more "sticky" - depositors who are not likely to move their money quickly

# 5 SVB and the Past Few Years

# Contents

# Examine What Happened over Past Few Years

I. Solvency: Transparent and up-to-date value of assets  
II. Solvency: Manage interest rate (duration) risk (and credit risk)  
III. Liquidity: Hold liquid assets  
IV. Deposits: Find "sticky" deposits

SVB did more-or-less the opposite - it was hard to get the true numbers behind the published balance sheet

- Delving a little into details about banking & accounting  
- Most bankers like to put assets into Held-to-Maturity portfolio  
- Claim that they will hold until maturity, so can report (on balance sheet) at original cost  
- Horrible, dangerous idea, but bankers (and regulators) do not like or trust market prices and mark-to-market

The Economist

I as % of total assets, and SVB stands out as above average. I cannot see true value of assets

# SVB (apparently) did a horrible job at this

- The Economist pointed out they bought long-dated US Treasury (and mortgage) bonds as deposits grew (in 2018, 2019, 2020)  
- Bought bonds when rates were low (and prices high)  
- In 2021 and 2022, interest rates soared, and bond prices fell  
- SVB apparently did not manage (hedge) that risk  
- Together with HtM of problem (1), means SVB lost money but nobody could easily see (until March 8)  
- They eventually had to sell all of their non-HtM portfolio (called Available for Sale assets) and lost \$1.8bn. No doubt more losses in the HtM portfolio

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/37a32ae7-5b6b-474d-be10-d56e67286a04/391ece502802275fe84cee9de1d8db4d5e38f043a721c6ef5b124552cdde0203.jpg)

# My Conclusion: SVB Made Mistakes, But Did Many Things Right  

SVB did many things right.

- Little speculative or risky loans or investments
- Very different from 2008 mortgage crises, where banks loaded up on worthless mortgages  
- SVB invested in US Treasuries and high-quality mortgage bonds

Let me be very clear: SVB made mistakes. Mistakes that led to failure

- Asset-liability (duration) mismatch: borrowed short-term (deposits), invested long-term (bonds)
- Classic banking activity, but always risky and needs to be well-managed  
- SVB managed poorly
- Poor reporting and accounting
- Large Held-to-Maturity portfolio that obscured underlying asset-liability (duration) mismatch

This is basic, simple, banking-101 - and SVB got it wrong

- Looks like SVB messed up the old-fashioned way, not through anything unethical or nefarious

# Examine More Closely SVB Losses on Assets

Picture (from NYTimes) shows gains & losses for both HtM and AfS portfolio

- Trying to capture true value of assets  
- Losses as % of deposits - SVB up to 9%  
- Look at the "Big Loss" below - I chose  $9\%$  of deposits  
- Close to true situation for SVB in 2022 - nearly insolvent  
- People did not realize until March 8

When run started, massive loss of deposits.

I've heard \$41bn left in a day or two  

- Looking at balance sheet (\$173.1bn deposits) no way they could survive

# Now Turn to First Republic Bank - Painful, But not SVB

Gains & losses for both HtM and AfS portfolio

- Losses as % of deposits - FRB up to about  $3.5\%$  
- Look at the "Big Loss" below - showing  $3.5\%$  of deposits  
- First Republic painful, but not insolvent  
- My view - caught in liquidity panic  
- Might survive, might not. But very different from SVB

# Thinking Carefully About Asset-Liability (Duration) Mismatch

Let's use the SVB balance sheet to think about asset-liability and duration mismatch

- "Duration" or interest rate sensitivity is a topic we cover in the next week or two  
- You will not be able to fully understand this discussion, but we will return to this

Some points re any bank balance sheet:

- Assets and liabilities must always match  
- Assets generally long-dated (long duration)
- What does this mean? Discuss "duration" next week
- Liabilities (deposits) short-dated

<table><tr><td colspan="2">ASSETS</td><td colspan="2">LIABILITIES</td></tr><tr><td>Loans</td><td>73.6</td><td>173.1</td><td>Deposits</td></tr><tr><td>Investments</td><td>125.1</td><td>22.4</td><td>Other</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>13.1</td><td>16.3</td><td>Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>211.8</td><td>211.8</td><td>Total</td></tr></table>

Let's use some of our tools (BPV and duration) for quick calculations on assets vs liabilities

- BPV and duration is what this course is about - you will learn this in the next few weeks

Assets: pretend all "Investments" are 8-year bonds

- BPV / Duration would be about 7.0 today

Rates  $\uparrow$  about 250bp (  $1\%$  to  $3.5\%$  ) from 2020-2022

- Let's say on average, 150bp.  
 - 7.0 BPV × 150bp × \$125.1bn ⇒ losing \$13bn  
- How to do this? I will assign problem set

Liabilities: focus on "Deposits"

- Technically, BPV / Duration 0.0 (daily maturity)  
- When rates  $\uparrow$  and Assets  $\downarrow$ , deposits no change  
- Big problem as Equity must  $\downarrow$  to balance

In reality, some deposits are "sticky"

- The more sticky, the higher the duration

# 7 In-Class Exercise (Break-Out Session) - 4yr  $6.5\%$  Bond

# Contents

# In-Class Exercise (Break-Out Session)

4-year bond,  $6.5\%$  annual coupon, price  $= 99.658 \longleftrightarrow$  yield  $= 6.6\%$

UST or FIS are simple examples

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/37a32ae7-5b6b-474d-be10-d56e67286a04/6bf502e834ba0f5bf3e25448bd6f5dd5568a409784725c9e5cf36f2db9ceab44.jpg)

Set up you TVM menu to do this calculation

- Need "P/YR=1" and "END"  
- When type in PV as -99.658, then press "I%YR" and get yield

<table><tr><td></td><td>N</td><td>I%YR</td><td>PV</td><td>PMT</td><td>FV</td></tr><tr><td>Given</td><td>4</td><td></td><td>-99.658</td><td>6.5</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Solve For</td><td></td><td>6.6</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

Now, what happens when price down to 99?

- Re-calculate

<table><tr><td></td><td>N</td><td>I%YR</td><td>PV</td><td>PMT</td><td>FV</td></tr><tr><td>Given</td><td>4</td><td></td><td>-99.0</td><td>6.5</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Solve For</td><td></td><td>6.794</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>
