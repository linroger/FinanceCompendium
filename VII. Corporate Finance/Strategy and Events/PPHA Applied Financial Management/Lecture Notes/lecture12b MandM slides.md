# Perfect & Imperfect Capital Markets Lecture 12 Supplement

Thomas S. Coleman

Harris PPHA 42510 Applied Financial Management

26 April 2023; Draft April 16, 2023

# Outline

1 Modigliani & Miller Prop 1 - Capital Structure Irrelevance (BMA Ch 17)

Perfect Capital Markets

Carving up Cash Flows

"Unwinding" Leverage

M&M Proposition 1: Leverage Doesn't Matter

2 "Imperfect" Capital Markets

First View - "Perfect Markets" - M&M - Debt vs Equity Irrelevant

Second View - Interest Deductible, Go To Debt

Third View - Financial Distress & Trade-Off

Fourth View - Asymmetric Information & Debt

Final Synthesis

# What Are "Perfect Capital Markets"?

What do we mean by "Perfect" Capital Markets? (and "Efficient" Markets)?

- NOT "good" in a normative sense – specialized or technical meaning of "theoretical ideal or starting point"  
- Nor "realistic" as in how markets actually behave

Three assumptions:

1 Complete Markets: Investors and firms trade securities at market prices, equal to PV of future CFs  
2 No costs: no taxes, transactions costs, or issuance costs for trading securities  
Financing does not change CFs: a firm's financing decisions do not change CFs generated by projects, and financing does not reveals new information about future CFs

# Value of "Perfect Markets"

These assumptions clearly not realistic. Why is the whole idea useful?

- We get strong results: M&M Prop 1: capital structure – debt vs equity – does not matter  
- We then can examine why capital structure matters – because of taxes? transaction costs?

General result for economic (and finance) theory: useful for pushing us to think about how and why the world works as it does

- We should see "Capital Structure doesn't matter" (M&M Prop 1)  
- If it does matter, why?  
- Some answers: interest taxes distort markets; bankruptcy is costly; information asymmetry

Perfect Capital Markets

Carving up Cash Flows

"Unwinding" Leverage

M&M Proposition 1: Leverage Doesn't Matter

2 "Imperfect" Capital Markets

First View – "Perfect Markets" – M&M – Debt vs Equity Irrelevant

Second View - Interest Deductible, Go To Debt

Third View - Financial Distress & Trade-Off

Fourth View - Asymmetric Information & Debt

Final Synthesis

# Modigliani & Miller Proposition 1

M&M Prop 1: Value is Unchanged by Capital Structure

- Total Value of the Firm = PV of CFs  
- This does not depend on choice of capital structure

We will see how this works by

- Looking at how firm carves up CFs with debt & equity

Changes risk of debt & equity CFs  

- Does not change risk of overall CFs
- See that investors can recombine CFs in any way they want  
- Investors can produce any risk profile they want, at no cost  
- Investors won't pay the firm extra to carve up CFs.

Result: Capital Structure won't change value (M&M Prop 1)

# Capital Structure Carves CFs

# CFs carved between debt and equity holders

Start from bottom (Firm CFs), go first to Debt, then Equity

How CFs distributed make huge difference in CF risk

- Debt less risky than equity  
- CFs go first to debt – if there is any money debt gets it  
Equity is residual - only what is left over the residual is always more risky - some chance you get nothing

# Debt, Equity, Debt / Equity, and Leverage

Assets - Total of the firm, all assets, the overall vale of the firm

Equity - What owners or shareholders put in, what owners can lose

Debt - Borrowings, what owners borrow

Owners can choose to borrow (issue debt) – choose Debt / Equity ratio

- Split overall Assets into Debt versus Equity

# Important Concepts

# Percent Debt

$$
\% D = \frac {D}{A} = \frac {D}{D + E}
$$

# Debt-to-Equity

%Leverage

$$
\frac {D}{E} = \frac {\% D}{1 - \% D}
$$

# Leverage

$$
\frac {\text {Assets}}{E} = \frac {A}{E} = \frac {1}{1 - \% D}
$$

# Examples

0%

50%

80%

0 or  $0\%$

1 or  $100\%$

4 or  $400\%$

1 or 1-to-1  
2 or 2-to-1  
5_or 5-to-1

Final Synthesis

# "Unwinding" Leverage

We will play a simple game: the firm takes CFs apart, we (investors) put them back together

Start from bottom (Firm CFs), split into Debt & E

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/21598f9e-9782-4fa9-babf-1d6ab7dfd89c/06ce231f8aa853becb3f782cb92234e9b0653ffe0a8df0f8083b8e7ff246e738.jpg)

With no transaction costs we can easily do this

# Next Step – "Do-it-Yourself Leverage"

But there is more – Investors can create any leverage (risk profile) they want Example from BMA, Table 17.2 & 17.3 – Macbeth Spot Removers

<table><tr><td>Number of shares</td><td>1000</td></tr><tr><td>Price per share</td><td>\$10</td></tr><tr><td>Mkt value of shares</td><td>\$10,000</td></tr></table>

ExpRet  $= 12.5$  StdDev  $= 6.45$

<table><tr><td></td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td></tr><tr><td>Operating Income</td><td>$500</td><td>$1,000</td><td>$1,500</td><td>$2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Earnings per share</td><td>$0.50</td><td>$1.00</td><td>$1.50</td><td>$2.00</td></tr><tr><td>Return on shares (%)</td><td>5%</td><td>10%</td><td>15%</td><td>20%</td></tr></table>

Macbeth realizes some investors want more return (and risk), so they decide to lever

# Firm Realizes Investors Want More Risk

Will investors pay more? Start with same price \$10/share

- Shift to 50/50 debt/equity  
- Issue \$5,000 debt (10% interest), repurchase 500 share  
Equity now more risky

Exactly same as levered equity, but done by investor

- Investor can do it no cost ("Perfect" markets) so won't pay firm to do it

Carving up Cash Flows

"Unwinding" Leverage

M&M Proposition 1: Leverage Doesn't Matter

2 "Imperfect" Capital Markets

First View – "Perfect Markets" – M&M – Debt vs Equity Irrelevant

Second View - Interest Deductible, Go To Debt

Third View - Financial Distress & Trade-Off

Fourth View - Asymmetric Information & Debt

Final Synthesis

# Conclusion: M&M Proposition 1 – Leverage Irrelevant

Debt versus Equity is irrelevant

"Do-it-yourself leverage"  

- Investors can do or undo whatever the firm does

Dependent on

1 Complete Markets: Investors and firms trade securities at market prices, equal to PV of future CFs  
2 No costs: no taxes, transactions costs, or issuance costs for trading securities  
Financing does not change CFs: a firm's financing decisions do not change CFs generated by projects, and financing does not reveals new information about future CFs

# WACC as result of Prop 1

M&M Prop 1 says overall value of the firm does not depend on debt versus equity

So now go back to simple game of carving and recombining CFs:

The firm takes CFs apart,  
We (investors) put them back together

But "reconstituted CFs" is a portfolio of Debt & Equity CFs. And we know portfolio return is weighted average of components:

$$
E R _ {p o r t} = \alpha_ {1} E R _ {1} + \alpha_ {2} E R _ {2}
$$

$$
r _ {u} = r _ {\text {a s s e t s}} = \frac {D}{E + D} r _ {D} + \frac {E}{E + D} r _ {E}
$$

Owning Debt + Equity

Debt & Equity Separated

Company CFs (profits)

# Expected Returns

As Debt-Equity ratio increases, expected return on equity increases.

Eventually, so does debt (as it becomes more risky)

Rates of return

# M&M Prop 1 – But Capital Structure Does Matter

Under "Perfect" capital markets

- Investors can provide "Do-it-Yourself" leverage  
- Will not pay extra for leveraging (or de-leveraging)

Capital Structure should be random - no industry patterns

Not True

- Some industries (internet like Google) borrow nothing  
- Others (airlines) borrow a lot

Why? Don't throw out theory - use M&M to understand

Example of economic theory deepening our understanding of the world  

- Taxes, bankruptcy costs, information asymmetry

# Interest "Tax Shield"

Debt provides real CFs – In US (and many others) interest is tax deductible.

Income with no debt versus some debt  

<table><tr><td></td><td>Unlevered</td><td>Levered</td></tr><tr><td>CF ( &amp; earn) before interest &amp; tax</td><td>100</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Interest to bondholders</td><td>0</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Pretax Income</td><td>100</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>Tax, 21%</td><td>21</td><td>19.32</td></tr><tr><td>Net income to shareholders</td><td>79</td><td>72.68</td></tr><tr><td>Total income to stock + bond</td><td>0+79=79</td><td>8+72.68=80.68</td></tr><tr><td>Interest tax shield (0.21*interest)</td><td>0</td><td>1.68</td></tr></table>

Simple idea: government gives cash: subsidy

Recurring story: government actions (well-intentioned) distort markets M&M says "how you slice the pie doesn't matter"

- Yogi Berra: Pizza's delivered. "Slice into eight pieces - I'm hungry"

Here it matters – gov't subsidizes debt with extra cash

# Interest "Tax Shield"

Debt provides real CFs – In US (and many others) interest is tax deductible.

Income with no debt versus some debt  

<table><tr><td></td><td>Unlevered</td><td>Levered</td></tr><tr><td>CF ( &amp; earn) before interest &amp; tax</td><td>100</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Interest to bondholders</td><td>0</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Pretax Income</td><td>100</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>Tax, 21%</td><td>21</td><td>19.32</td></tr><tr><td>Net income to shareholders</td><td>79</td><td>72.68</td></tr><tr><td>Total income to stock + bond</td><td>0+79=79</td><td>8+72.68=80.68</td></tr><tr><td>Interest tax shield (0.21*interest)</td><td>0</td><td>1.68</td></tr></table>

Example: Interest  \$8, "tax shield" = 0.21 *\$ 8

Call this "tax shield" because shielded from taxes

Extra income firm can pay to investors instead of gov't

Essentially a gov't subsidy for debt (vs equity)

Less than before 2017 - US rate was  $35\%$

# M&M with Tax Shield – Gov't Subsidizes Debt

M&M Prop 1 says value of firm does not depend on debt versus equity

But we know tax shield has value

The firm takes CFs apart,  
We (investors) put them back together

No taxes:

Firm CFs  $\rightarrow$  Debt  $^+$  Equity  

- Investors take Debt + Equity → Firm CFs

Yes taxes, Net out tax shield PV

Firm CFs  $\rightarrow$  Debt  $^+$  Equity  $^+$  Taxes  

- Investors take Debt + Equity → Firm CFs - Taxes

For Debt, Gov't gives some taxes back

- With debt, get CF of tax shield,  $T_{c} \cdot Int$

# In-Class Exercise: Tax Shield as Government Subsidy – PV Tax Shield

In M&M (no taxes) there are two slices to the pizza: debt & equity

- Taxes: third slice (government) matters because you get cash back on debt  
- Higher debt  $\rightarrow$  higher firm value; part of government slice  $\rightarrow$  firm

Fun result: PV(tax shield) =  $T_{c} \cdot D$

- Yrly CF =  $T_{c} \cdot D \cdot r$ , every yr forever (annuity)  
PV Annuity  $= CF / r = T_{c}\cdot D\cdot r / r = T_{c}\cdot D$

Example: Johnson & Johnson (\$mn) - BMA Section 18-1, p 449  

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets Market Value</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities Market Value</td></tr><tr><td>Net Working Cap</td><td>31,757</td><td>13,031</td><td>Long-term Debt</td></tr><tr><td>PV Interest Tax Shld</td><td>2,737</td><td>15,577</td><td>Other long-term Liab</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term Assets</td><td>160,335</td><td>166,221</td><td>Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Total Assets</td><td>194,829</td><td>194,829</td><td>Total Value</td></tr></table>

# In-Class Exercise: Tax Shield as Government Subsidy – PV Tax Shield

Now let's move  \$10,000mn from Equity to Debt. In-class Exercise Market value liabilities: Borrow additional\$ 10,000 (increase "LT Debt")

- PV Tax Shield: \(D = \\)10,000, T_c = 21\%\(, PV(tax shield) = \(T_c \cdot D\)  
- Add this to the original \(2,737 to get new PV Tax Shield  
Calculate MV of "Total Assets"  
- MV "Total Assets" = MV "Total Liabilities"

Example: Johnson & Johnson (\$mn) - BMA Section 18-1, p 449

 Shareholders win by \$2,100. Why?  
- Get \$10,000 from issuing new bond, MV equity down by only \$7,900

Example: Johnson & Johnson (\$mn) - BMA Section 18-1, p 449

# Value of Tax Shield

MV of debt up by  \$10,000mn, but MV of equity only down\$ 7,900mn.

PV(tax shield) = tax rate * Debt (Tc*D) = 0.21*$10,000 = $2,100mn

- Why  $Tc^{*}D$  and not  $Tc^{*}D^{*}r$ ? (yearly amount - tax rate * amount of debt * interest payment)  
- Assume tax (and debt) will be there forever.  
- PV perpetuity =  $\frac{CF}{r}$

Refined version of M&M Prop 1 (Debt Irrelevance):

Value of firm = value if all-equity-finance + PV(tax shield)

PV(tax shield) ↑ as debt ↑

- Argues that firms should go to  $100\%$  debt-financed  
- Clearly not true

Look at Costs of high debt (bankruptcy)

# Taxes Subsidize Debt, But Firms not All Debt

We don't see firms using all debt

- Some industries (internet like Google) borrow nothing  
- Others (airlines) borrow a lot

Need to dig deeper, understand why industries vary

Example of economic theory deepening our understanding of the world  

- Taxes partial, turn to bankruptcy costs, information asymmetry

<table><tr><td>Industry</td><td>Median Book Debt Ratio</td></tr><tr><td>Internet information providers</td><td>.00</td></tr><tr><td>Major integrated oil and gas</td><td>.10</td></tr><tr><td>Semiconductors</td><td>.11</td></tr><tr><td>Communication equipment</td><td>.16</td></tr><tr><td>Biotechnology</td><td>.17</td></tr><tr><td>Consumer appliances</td><td>.21</td></tr><tr><td>Railroads</td><td>.40</td></tr><tr><td>Gas utilities</td><td>.45</td></tr><tr><td>Hotels</td><td>.56</td></tr><tr><td>Airlines</td><td>.96</td></tr></table>

Final Synthesis

# What pushes Away from  $100\%$  Debt?

We don't see really high debt ratios (in most industries)

Good evidence firms don't fully exploit tax shield

Major reason - cost of debt and cost of Financial Distress

BUT - this is not "Bankruptcy" alone

- Monetary costs associated with bankruptcy itself  
- Games played before bankruptcy

# Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy is a beautiful thing – part of the power of free markets

- Debt is a promise - we all know it may get broken  
- Nothing wrong with bankruptcy, when try honestly and fail

What is bankruptcy?

Shareholders admit that the value of assets less than promises made  

- Pass assets to debt-holders - debtholders become new owners

Simple act of bankruptcy not a "cost" – don't get confused by loss in bankruptcy

Enron (p. 465) – at peak stock worth \$60bn+. By end-2001 worthless.  

- Not \$60bn "loss" – Enron was worthless at peak (fraud), just didn't know it.
- Actually some "shorters" did know - huge service for all of us, hard work of ferreting out problems the rest of us are too lazy to uncover

Bankruptcy is simple and wonderful part of capitalism

# Financial Distress

Financial Distress is more the simple Bankruptcy:

Promises to creditors are honored with difficulty (imposing costs)

Costs of bankruptcy

- Direct costs, such as lawyers, accountants  
- Indirect costs - eg customers and employees may leave

Games – that destroy value – played before bankruptcy

- Before, when probability high, substantial costs  
Shareholders try and extract value from debtholders  
- Simple transfer would be OK, but this destroys value

# Bankruptcy Costs

Bankruptcy can be long, expensive process

- Direct costs - Pay lawyers, accountants

Enron - \$757mn in legal, accounting, other  

- Lehman - likely as much as \$1,500mn
- Indirect costs - many - eg customers, employees leave  
- Big issue in 2008 financial crisis - huge disruption when financial firm goes under

# Evidence

- Difficult to separate, but cost might something like  $3 \%$ of total (book) assets,  $20 \%$ of market value of equity  
- Best evidence - reluctance of creditors to push insolvent firms (MV assets  $<$  MV liabilities) into bankruptcy (transfer assets to creditors)  
- Often, creditors would rather have managers and shareholders try to get back to health

# Financial Distress – Games People Play

Economics teaches us to think about Incentives

Before bankruptcy, probability high, substantial costs.

- Diverging incentives: pushes people to play "games"  
- Individually optimal (for shareholders), but destroy firm value

Game 1 - Risk Shifting

Shareholders take on extra risk

Other games

- Failure to contribute equity capital  
Cash in and run  
- Play for time

Costs of Financial Distress  $\uparrow$  with level of debt

Costs of Distress vary with type of asset

Airplanes - physical asset, easy to re-sell, won't lose value  

- Trading franchise - disappears over a weekend (Lehman in 2008)

# Risk Shifting - Equity as Call

Powerful idea: Equity is call option on firm value

Shareholders get profits if Assets > Debt  
Shareholders walk away for free if Assets  $<$  Debt

From seminal paper by Merton (1974) – Corporate debt as put option

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/21598f9e-9782-4fa9-babf-1d6ab7dfd89c/09b1048bb8e30161af9d7bfa5cb39c5756dfaee24dc7f3c83f4e3f81d9e5d324.jpg)

Stock - call option "hockey stick" - Long

- Assets  $<$  B (debt) shareholders get 0  
- Assets > B, shareholders get upside Bond - put option "hockey stick" - Short  
- Assets  $<$  B bondholders get assets  
- Assets > B bondholders get repaid B

Nothing "unfair" about this; Up-front PV reflects option values

- But provides incentive for games around B (bankruptcy)

# Option Value ↑ as Volatility ↑

Stock: Long Call; Bond: Short Put: Option value  $\uparrow$  as Volatility  $\uparrow$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-02/21598f9e-9782-4fa9-babf-1d6ab7dfd89c/7d97b9860f0703006c8a182bedacdbd3b198213ffc41bd5c02ef84a5654143ab.jpg)

See this looking at:

- Black-Scholes option formula -  
- Assets just  $< \mathrm{B} :$  I win if  $\uparrow$  ,you lose if  $\downarrow$

Shareholders want to increase volatility: Call ↑, Put ↓

Example: Assets  $< \mathsf{B}$ , but interest not due for another year

Shareholders can take on negative NPV project that has slight chance of moving Assets > B  

- Destroys value, but shareholders have nothing to lose

# Risk Shifting Example

"Circular File Co.": Owe debt \$50: insolvent now but debt due next year

- Bonds worth \(25 (< \text{promised} \\) 50)\( - need option model to get value

<table><tr><td colspan="4">Circular File Co. Before Negative NPV</td></tr><tr><td>Net Working Cap</td><td>$20</td><td>$25</td><td>Bonds</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed assets</td><td>$10</td><td>$5</td><td>Common stock</td></tr><tr><td>Total assets</td><td>$30</td><td>$30</td><td>Total value</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td colspan="4">Circular File Co. After Negative NPV</td></tr><tr><td>Net Working Cap</td><td>$10</td><td>$20</td><td>Bonds</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed assets</td><td>$18</td><td>$8</td><td>Common stock</td></tr><tr><td>Total assets</td><td>$28</td><td>$28</td><td>Total value</td></tr></table>

Negative NPV Project: \$10 investment, 10% chance \$120, 90% lose \$3.56;

\(EV = \\(8.80\)  
Disc  $10\%$ , EPV = \$8

Shareholders do it

- \(10\%\) win: get \\(80: 120 + 10 (existing) - 50 (debt)  
- $90\%$  lose: get zero anyway

Destroy \$2 worth of firm value – but shareholders better off

# Other Games

# Failure to contribute equity capital

- Flip side to "Risk Shifting" - do not invest in positive NPV project - because not enough to push Assets > B (won't dig firm out of the hole)

# Cash in and Run

Try to suck cash out  

- Bankruptcy court can claw back fraudulent conveyance - but subtle ways to extract cash

# Play for Time

- Delay bankruptcy and hope something good will happen  
- Meantime, assets waste away

# Debt versus Distress

Debt  $\uparrow \Rightarrow$  tax savings  $\uparrow$ , but also prob of bankruptcy  $\uparrow$  (moves up  $B$ , bankruptcy threshold)

Tradeoff between tax benefits & bankruptcy costs

- Easy-to-sell assets (lower cost in bankruptcy) should have higher debt  
- Compare computer businesses (assets = human capital that can walk – low debt) vs airlines (planes easy to sell – high debt)

Explains many observations

- Industry differences - high-tech vs airlines

But not complete story - many successful firms use little debt

- Southwest Airlines, largely equity-financed (2009)

First View – "Perfect Markets" – M&M – Debt vs Equity Irrelevant

Second View - Interest Deductible, Go To Debt

Third View - Financial Distress & Trade-Off

Fourth View - Asymmetric Information & Debt

Final Synthesis

# Asymmetric Information pushes to Debt

Asymmetric Information: firm cannot transmit information believably

Two firms: Jones, Inc. (optimistic) and Smith & Co. (pessimistic)

- Jones has trouble convincing investors (all firms say good things)

Now they want to raise capital. Round 1:

- Jones (optimistic) sells debt since equity is "underpriced"  
- Smith (pessimistic) issues equity since it is "overpriced"

Round 2:

- Investors take information from Smith, realize equity overpriced

Round 3:

- Smith sells debt instead, since selling equity would be bad-news signal

Result: Both firms pushed towards debt

# End Result – "Pecking Order"

Firms prefer internal finance – reinvesting earns so don't have to issue new equity  

- If have to raise external finance, start with debt, then equity as last resort

Final Synthesis

# Final Synthesis

Neither "Trade-off" nor "Pecking Order" are perfect

Some evidence by Raghuram Rajan & Luigi Zingales (Booth), found 4 factors matter:

$\Theta$  Size: Large firms higher debt (Trade-off)  
2 Tangible Assets: more fixed assets, higher debt (Trade-off)  
3 Profitability: more profitable, lower debt (Pecking Order, can use internal)  
Market-to-Book: higher market-to-book, lower debt

Not perfect, but we have come a long way in understanding capital markets using our assumption of "Perfect Capital Markets"

- M&M not "true" but incredibly useful
