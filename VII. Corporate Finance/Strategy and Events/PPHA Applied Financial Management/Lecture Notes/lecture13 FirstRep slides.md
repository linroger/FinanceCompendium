# First Republic Bank Failure

Thomas S. Coleman

Harris PPHA 42510 & 42521

1 May 2023, Draft May 1, 2023

# First Republic Bank Failed & Taken Over by JP Morgan

First Republic lost \(100mn in customer deposits past months

- FRB customers now JP Morgan customers • P Morgan pays $10.6bn for FRB  
 Cost to FDIC is $13bn (vs $20bn for SVB)  
- Depositors don't lose anything  
- FRB shareholders lose everything

Finance & economics | Another one bites the dust

First Republic fails, and is snapped up by JPMorgan Chase

Regulators arrange a deal for the California-based lender

# Appears SVB Was (Almost) Insolvent

Picture (from NYTimes) shows gains & losses for both Held to Maturity and Available for Sale portfolio

- Trying to capture true value of assets  
- Losses as % of deposits - SVB up to 9%  
- Look at the "Big Loss" below - I chose  $9 \%$ of deposits  
- Close to true situation for SVB in 2022 - nearly insolvent  
People did not realize until March 8

When run started, massive loss of deposits.

- I've heard $41bn left in a day or two  
- Looking at balance sheet (\$173.1bn deposits) no way they could survive

SVB is now in a very delicate position, with both Solvency Risks and Liquidity Risks

# Solvency Risk

# Liquidity Risk

Depositors worried investments may go down more

- Regular debts (like for Apple) cannot withdraw early  
Deposits can, and rational to do so  
- Get out now, before things get worse

Even if knew for sure assets would not go down

- Assets may be illiquid – take a few months or year to sell off  
- Depositors may need money back sooner  
Rational to get first in line, take money out now

Silicon Valley Bank was effectively insolvent

- Assets barely worth the value of fixed obligations – "Deposits" & "Other"

# Now Turn to First Republic Bank – Painful, But not SVB

# Gains & losses for both HtM and AfS portfolio

- Losses as % of deposits - FRB up to about  $3.5\%$  
- Look at the "Big Loss" below - showing  $3.5\%$  of deposits  
- First Republic painful, but not insolvent  
- My view - caught in liquidity panic  
- Might survive, might not. But very different from SVB

FRB is not insolvent

# Solvency Risk

Depositors worried investments may go down more

- Regular debts (like for Apple) cannot withdraw early  
Deposits can, and rational to do so  
Get out now, before things get worse

First Republic Bank was not insolvent – but subject to liquidity problems and a bank run

- Bank run – where customers withdraw deposits because they are worried the bank will get into trouble in the futures

This is exactly what happened to First Republic
