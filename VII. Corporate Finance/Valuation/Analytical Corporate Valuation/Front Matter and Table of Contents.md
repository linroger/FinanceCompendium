# Preface

Without a doubt, finance has undertaken a central role in the strategic governance of the company. In the recent decades, finance has been characterized by a strong development in the passage from a marginal and subordinate role compared with the other primary divisions to a central role in company governance. Today, finance is not only strictly related to these classical divisions by influencing their choices and their operating processes, but also it is increasingly able to influence the company's strategies and it is not unusual that it can in itself represent the starting point of new strategies and business models.

This central role of finance in the life of a company is undoubtedly the result of the globalization process and the correlated strong, fast and deep development of capital markets that have changed the development of economic models and then the company's business model.

The role of finance and its contribution is increasingly important for the survival and development of the company over time. Finance has already changed and will probably change more and more together with its paradigms, strategies and operating processes. Today, and even more in the future, it is difficult to imagine doing business without doing finance as well.

This book is based on a shareholder-oriented capitalism. Consequently, the company can thrive only if it is able to create value for the shareholders over time. In the Great Recession period as derived from the financial crisis of 2007-2008, this approach could be unpopular. Indeed, in common sense and in a part of academics the recent financial crisis is usually charged to the shareholder-oriented capitalism. This is especially true in Europe for economic and business cultures. I believe that the financial crisis cannot be attributed to a shareholder-oriented capitalism but to a particular distortion. The problem is the transfer from the long-term perspective to a short-term perspective. It is in contrast with one of the most relevant fundamental principles in the shareholders' value creation perspective that states the company's capability to create shareholders' value in the long-period is not the same as the maximization of its short-term profits. Often the choice of maximizing the shareholders' value in the long-term perspective is irreconcilable with the choice of maximizing the shareholders' value in the short-term period. Consequently, if the

value creation in the long-term is confused with the profit in the short-term, it generates a great problem capable of damaging shareholders' interests as well as the stakeholders' interests. Therefore, the main problem of the financial crisis is not the shareholders' value perspective but the short-term perspective of some managers.

The company's ability to create value for the shareholders over time is strictly related to the deep understanding of the business model of the company as well as the investors' behaviour in the capital markets. The company valuation can be considered one of the most relevant fields in which the classical paradigms of the company meet the paradigms of the capital markets. Indeed, the right company's valuation requires high competence in the fields of strategy, financial management, corporate finance and capital markets.

The basic equation of the value is based on a principle that dates back to Alfred Marshall: a company creates value if and only if the return on capital invested exceeds its cost of capital.

The amount of value is equal to the difference between cash-in flows derived from the investment and the cost of capital invested able to reflect the time value of money and the risk premium. Consequently, to create value over time, the company must invest the capital raised at a rate of return higher than its cost of capital. Therefore, there are two main variables of value creation:

- the return on capital invested;
- the cost of capital.

In this book, the company's ability to invest the capital raised by obtaining a high return is investigated through an analysis of the company's fundamentals with regards to its business model and its economic and financial performance over time.

Specifically, the return on capital invested in the business is function of the company's business model and the quantitative effects of the strategic choices on its economic and financial dynamics. Specifically, the company's ability to create profit over time requires an analysis based on two main parts:

- the qualitative analysis of the business model;
- the quantitative analysis of the company's performance which regards the effects of the business model choices on the economic and financial dynamics over time.

Otherwise, the company's cost of capital invested in its business is derived from the investors' behaviour and their analysis of the risk-return profile of the company in the capital markets. The cost of capital for the company is one of the most relevant topics for managers and financial economists, and it plays a central role in the valuation models of the company. For decades, several studies have focused on the relationship between capital structure, cost of capital and company value. Despite a broad experience approach in both academic and practices, it should not be surprising that the method for estimation of the cost of capital is still under intensive discussion.

An estimation of the cost of capital for the company is based on the investors' behaviour and expectations in the capital market. It requires the knowledge of their models about the risk valuation and the expected returns estimation. The greater the managers' skill to understand the investors' behaviour and their choices, the greater the company's probability to satisfy the investors' expectations by acquiring the capital required for its development at favourable conditions.

Specifically, the cost of capital is function of the asset pricing in the capital markets. It is the function of the investors' models about risk diversification and returns maximization, and thus, it can be derived by general equilibrium model in the capital market.

Based on these two variables, return on capital invested and the cost of capital, the company's ability to create value over time for its shareholders is the function of the effectiveness of the Company Strategic Formula to create expected cash-flows as well as investors' models to diversify the risk and maximize expected returns in order to estimate the cost of capital.

The basic equation of value states that the company creates value if and only if the return on capital invested exceeds its cost of capital. The explicit application of the basic equation can be realized through several methodologies. Among them, the Discounted Cash-Flows model (DCF) is the best. It is commonly used in the financial community. It is relevant since all members of the international financial community use a common criteria and language.

By using the DCF approach, the company value is equal to the current value of expected future cash-flows and the cost of capital is used as a discount rate. Therefore, there are three main variables:

- Time: the referenced time is the future. The value of the company is strictly related to future performance rather than past performance;
- Cash-flows: company's performance is measured in cash-flow terms. Specifically, the expected future cash-flows from operations and to equity;
- Cost of capital: it is the cost of debt and the cost of equity, and it defines the discount rate for expected future cash-flows.

The General Equation of Value can be defined based on these three main variables as follows:

$$
W _ {F} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {C F _ {t}}{(1 + k) ^ {t}} \tag {1}
$$

where  $W_{F}$  is the company's value;  $t$  is the period-time of valuation;  $CF_{t}$  is the expected future cash-flows for each year ( $t$ );  $k$  is the cost of capital used as a discounted rate.

Equation (1) has a great theoretical relevance. It estimates the value of the company based on expected cash-flows, arising from the fundamental analysis of the company and the cost of capital. Also, the equation defines the relationship

between company value, the expected cash-flows and the cost of capital in the time of valuation.

The integration between models on company's fundamentals from which the expected cash-flows are derived and the investors' models about risk and return in the capital market by which the cost of capital for the company is derived can be summarized as follows (Fig. 1).

The integration between the company's fundamental analysis and the investors' models of risk and returns in the capital markets is essential for the company's success over time. It is not possible to fully understand the company's ability to create value over time and to measure this value without the simultaneous deep knowledge of these models and their integration.

Consequently, the managers must define their strategies and operational processes by considering the business and industrial logics with regard to customers, suppliers, competitors, as well as the financial criterion with regard to investors in equity and debt.

Therefore, clear thinking about drivers of the company's value creation as well as a right approach to its measurement requires two main skills: (i) the analysis and evaluation of the company's fundamentals with regards to its business model and its performances over time; (ii) the knowledge of the investors' models about risk diversification and returns maximization from which the cost of capital for the firm is derived. To integrate the company's fundamental analysis and the investors' models about risk and return in the capital markets with reference to company valuation, the book is characterized by a large recourse to a rigorous quantitative analysis. Specifically, the methodological approach used in this book is based on:

- mathematics, to assure the consistency of models in its construction;
- graphics, to provide intuition;
- words, to explain the results and the economic significance.

The large use of a rigorous quantitative analysis to integrate the company's fundamental analysis and the investors' models about risk and return in the capital markets in order to the company valuation is not to complicate the analysis but, on the contrary, to simplify the discussion. There are three main reasons.

- first, models are easier to understand if they are studied in their formal construction. The mathematical form allows us to further understand the models in their construction, assumptions and, then, in their clear capabilities and limits;
- second, the mathematical form does not allow inappropriate manipulation of the equations and, consequently, an incorrect use of the models. Every equation is the result of a rigorous formal process and their modification can be realized only by following the same rigorous formal process;
- third, the mathematical form does not allow for attribution of the equation meanings that are not supported by their strict formal derivation. Every equation acquires form and meanings strictly related to the mathematical process of derivation. The clear derivation step-by-step of each equation does not allow errors in the equations interpretation and, consequently, in the use of models.
