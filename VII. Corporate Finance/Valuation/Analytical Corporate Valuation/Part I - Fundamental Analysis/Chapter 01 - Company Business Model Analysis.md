Abstract This first step of the company analysis focuses on the business model. The company's "health condition" in a defined period of time and its ability to create profit over time requires an analysis based on two main elements:

- a qualitative analysis of the business model;
- a quantitative analysis of the effects of the business model choices on the economic and financial dynamics over time.

A qualitative analysis of the company's business model focuses on the Company Strategic Formula (CSF).

The CSF defines the strategic profile of the company on the basis of two different strategic fronts:

- internal strategic front referring to the internal structure of the company;
- external strategic front referring to the structural relationships between the company and the players of its environment classified into two main groups: business players and financial players.

The CSF allows for simultaneous optimisation of the companies operating in the Strategic Business Area and Capital Market. The internal and the external strategic fronts are strictly connected on the basis of systemic and dynamic bidirectional relationships. In this sense the CSF must be "continuant": it is achieved only if the relationships between all of its elements are Systemic-Structural-Dynamic.

A quantitative analysis of the company focuses on the economic and financial dynamics over time. Several analytical schemes can be used. In this context the analysis is developed on the basis of Operating and Net Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, and Free Cash-flow from Operations and Free-Cash Flow to Equity.

The qualitative and quantitative analyses are strictly related. The competitive advantage of the company, on the basis of its business model, must be reflected in the economic and financial values over time. Consequently, it is not possible to investigate into the company by only taking into consideration the analysis of its business model without considering the effects of the strategic choices on the

economic and financial dynamics. At the same time, it is impossible to investigate into the company's ability to perform by considering the economic and financial dynamics without clearly understanding the source of the strategic choices.

# 1.1 Strategic Formula of the Company

The company can be defined as a dynamic and open system towards the environment with which it maintains several types of relationships in order to pursue the economic and financial equilibrium to be valid over time.

The company can be considered as a production system, with regards to the combination and coordination of its production factors, as well as a system of relationships with the environment with which it exchanges materials and products, flows of information and financial values on the other side (Bertini 1990; Bianchi Martini 2009).

Although the company is part of the environment, from which it can never be separated, it qualifies itself as unique, different and independent from the environment. The company defines its profile and the business, and it identifies the players with which it establishes bi-directional relationships (Giannessi 1979; Bertini 1990; Coda 1988).

Relationships between the company and the environment are constantly changing due to the dynamic company-environment paradigm. The dynamic nature of the competitive context drives the company towards constant renewal. It requires a "strategic attitude" from the company rather than a defined strategy (Bertini 1995; Garzella 2005, 2006; Markides 2008; Galeotti and Garzella 2013). Therefore, the definition and development of the strategy should not be considered as a separate and unique moment in the life of the company, but an on-going process.

Based on these considerations, the company's government requires a model characterized by internal efficiency and effectiveness on the one side, and a coherent and balanced system of relationships with all external players on the other side.

The company's "health condition" in a defined period of time and its ability to create profit over time requires an analysis based on two main elements:

- the first is a qualitative analysis of the business model;
- the second is a quantitative analysis of the effects of the business model choices on the economic and financial dynamics over time.

These two parts are strictly related. In reality, it is not possible to investigate into the company through the sole analysis of its business model without considering the effects of the strategic choices on the economic and financial dynamics. In the same way, it is impossible to investigate into the real company's ability to perform by taking into consideration the economic and financial dynamics without fully understanding the source of the strategic choices.

Therefore, the competitive advantage of the company on the basis of its business model must be reflected in the economic and financial values over time.

This paragraph focuses on a qualitative analysis of the company's business model, while the other paragraphs focus on the analysis of the economic and financial dynamics over time.

The qualitative analysis of the company's business model proposed in this context is defined as a "Company Strategic Formula" (CSF) (De Luca 2013a, 2015; De Luca et al. 2016, 2017).

The CSF is the business model of the company as defined in its strategic profile. Specifically, the CSF defines the way in which the company is organised internally and how it manages the relationships with external players for self-development over time.

The CSF can be considered as the ideal conceptual place in which, on the basis of a systemic and dynamic paradigm:

(a) the ideas are developed;
(b) the decisions are made;
(c) the operations are defined and planned.

On the basis of a systemic and dynamic perspective, the CSF allows for the transformation of the "system of ideas" into the "systems of operations" by means of the "systems of decisions" in order to achieve and maintain economic-financial equilibrium over time. Therefore, CSF takes form and substance in a unique, systemic and dynamic way to the entrepreneurship and managerial skills of the company (Bertini 1995). It allows the company to acquire and develop over time a certain level of superiority over competitors, both qualitative (with regards to the acquisition, development and conservation of a defensible competitive advantage) and quantitative (with regards to the achievement of economic and financial performance levels higher than those of their competitors) (Porter 1985; Grant 1991; Invernizzi 2008; Galeotti and Garzella 2013).

The CSF defines the strategic profile of the company, by considering two different "strategic fronts":

- internal strategic front: it refers to the internal structure of the company;
- external strategic front: it refers to the structural relationships between the company and the players of its environment classified into two main groups of business players and financial players.

# Internal Front of the Csf

The Internal Strategic Front (ISF) refers to the internal structure of the company. It is defined from all elements, tangible and intangible, needed for the production of goods and services. The internal structure defines the company's specific characteristics by generating its uniqueness. It gives form and substance to the CSF by establishing the uniqueness of the thinking and operation of the company. Therefore, it is the main reason for which one company is different from another.

The internal structure of the company must be contemporarily both "stable in the moment" and "dynamic over time". It must be constantly seeking a form of balance between the internal characteristics of the company and the needs of the markets in order to develop and defend the competitive advantage.

The internal structure of the company is defined on the basis of three main elements:

(a) Corporate governance
(b) Organizational architecture
(c) Strategic resources

# (a) Corporate Governance

The corporate governance of the company refers to the rules and the procedures by which the decision-making processes in the governmental area and how the managerial and operating activities of the company are defined (Bertini 2009).

Corporate governance plays a key role in the CSF by activating processes that can be virtuous or vicious as the case may be (Bianchi Martini 2009).

It is important to highlight how the corporate governance quality is a function of its operating efficiency rather than compliance with the rules as defined by law. Corporate governance involves "substance" rather than "form"; it is a "system of government" rather than a "system of rules" (Bertini 2009).

In this sense the corporate governance processes and rules that involve all managers must necessarily be characterised by a high level of professionalism and competence (Bianchi Martini 2009). Therefore, the corporate governance model is defined based on the specific characteristics of the company (Fiori et al. 2004) mainly with regards to its well-defined elements of "entrepreneurship" and "managerial" skills. While the first refers to the company's ability to project itself towards the future looking for new opportunities, the second refers to the knowledge and competence needed for fulfilment of the opportunities by connecting the entrepreneurial intuition and its execution. This combination allows for facing of the customers' expectations by creating value for the company over time (Bertini 1995, 2009).

The mechanism by which the entrepreneurial idea is converted into the company's strategies on the basis of the resources available is function of the corporate governance (Bertini 1995; Bianchi Martini 2009). Corporate governance defines the mechanism of dynamic and bidirectional relationships between the company and its environment on the basis of the entrepreneurial idea and the specific decision-making process of the company.

The decision-making processes must be considered able to affect the entrepreneurial idea, by modifying it in several forms and degrees, based on the knowledge arising from the systemic and dynamic bidirectional relationships between internal and external strategic fronts (Mintzberg 1994).

It is worth noting that the corporate governance of the company is also influenced by the structure of the economic and financial system and the culture of the country references of the company (Bianchi Martini 2009). In this sense, it can be distinguished between two dimensions of the corporate governance: the first is

based on the unique nature and specific characteristics of the company while the second is function of the specific characteristics of the institutional, economic, financial and culture system of the country references of the company. With regards to this second dimension, there are two main models: the model of "market-oriented" and "bank-oriented" capitalism.

The model of "market-oriented" capitalism is based on the separation between management and shareholders of the company.

In this model the main problems of governance refer to the agency conflicts (Jensen and Meckling 1976; Jensen 1986). The agency conflicts are carried out between management and shareholders, as well as, shareholders and debtholders. Managers, shareholders and debtholders are all focused on the company value creation but they are characterized by different utility functions and different information owned due to the different role in the company's government (Dallocchio et al. 2011).

With regards to the conflicts between managers and shareholders, the different utility function and the information asymmetries lead the first to maximize the enterprise value while leading the second to the equity value. The agency costs on equity are due to the introduction of control mechanisms on management activities, as well as the introduction of a managers compensation system to align the aims of managers with those of the shareholders.

With regards to the conflicts between shareholders and debtholders, the different utility functions and the information asymmetries lead the first to maximize the dividends and investment policies even at the expenses of debtholders. In this sense high risk investments are preferred. In this case, by considering the limited liability of the shareholders and the fixed remuneration of debtholders, if the investment is successful, the shareholders obtain the benefits while if the investment fails the debtholders claim a part of the cost if the company cannot pay interest on debt and debt reimbursement. Therefore, the debtholders do not participate in the investment benefits but they may have to bear the costs in the event of failure (Harris and Raviv 1991; Diamond 1989).

Furthermore, the shareholders lead managers to maximize the dividend policy. A policy of high dividends reduces the company's self-funding by reducing sources to be invested in the business. Over time it can reduce the company's ability to face customer expectations. It increases the operating and financial risk of the company by reducing the company's ability to face debt obligations.

The cost of an agency on debt is mainly due to the debtholders' policies to reduce the risk of shareholders' opportunistic behaviour. The adoption of these policies by debtholders increases the cost of debt ex-ante due to the real application of opportunistic behaviour due to the low level of confidence of debtholders in the company (Myers 1977; Dallocchio and Salvi 2004).

The "bank-oriented" capitalism model is based on the strong relationship between bank systems and industrial systems. In this context the banks play a key role in the capital structure of the companies. Therefore, the bank can play an important role in the company's corporate governance and thus on the company's choices regarding strategies and operations. The bank's control on management and

shareholders reduces agency costs on equity and debt. On the contrary, there are two main problems: the first refers to the conflict between majority and minority shareholders based on the asymmetric information, while the second refers to annulment of the capital market discipline effects. The capital market is unable to measure the company's performance and the price is no longer the reference point of the company's value and its operativeness. In this context only a few large companies are financed on the basis of policy choice rather than on the capital market's selection based on the effectiveness and efficiencies of the companies with all imaginable negative effects.

# (b) Organizational Architecture

The organizational architecture of the company refers to how the company's resources are combined and coordinated between them for company operations.

The company's ability to compete in the business is strictly related to its organization structure and operations.

There are two main levels involved:

- the organizational structure of the company with regards to both hard and soft elements that give form, substance and operation to all parts of the organization;
- the operations with regards to the processes and procedures that cross the company vertically and horizontally.

The organisational structure defines the organizational context. It defines the decision-making environment in which company strategies are defined. It is based on hard and soft components. While the hard components define the mechanical operating nature of the organisational structure, the soft components define the operating mode based on formal and informal flows of information.

The hard component refers to the variables that define the organizational model. It defines the work model of the company, the levels of hierarchy, the relationship mechanisms among all parts of the organizational structure, both formal and informal.

There are three main elements that define the hard components (Invernizzi 1999):

- organizational model: this choice is a function of the company's characteristics and the decision-making processes. There are two main logics: a vertical logic, based on hierarchy relationships among the different levels, or a horizontal logic based on the processes and activities that cross the company;
- organizational microstructure: this choice involves the definition of the central, staff and line functions with regards to their internal structure, roles, positions and skills;
- mechanisms of relationship: they involve definition of the characteristics and structure of the relationships among all parts of the organizational structure, both formal and informal.

The soft component refers to the intangible variables such as culture, values and managerial approach (Invernizzi 2011). They give substance to the relationship mechanisms in the organizational structure on the basis of the behaviour acquired by the company as function of its value and culture (Hofstede 1993).

There are two main elements to define the soft component of the organizational structure (Invernizzi 1999):

- the degree of entrepreneurship: there are two main archetypes of organizational context. The first is the entrepreneurial model based on a high level of informal relationships in the company in order to develop a new idea thanks to the contribution of all parts of the company. The second is the bureaucratic model based on a high level of formal relationships in the company in a rigid structure based on strictly hierarchy levels;
- the degree of discipline: there are two main archetypes of organizational context. The first is the discipline model characterized by a high level of cooperation among all parts of the organization leading to maximisation of efficiency. The second is the undisciplined model characterized by a high level of confusion and opportunistic behaviours in all parts of the company.

Therefore, while the hard elements define the operating units of the company and their relationships based on rational mechanics, the soft elements give life and substance to the company in a unique way based on the value, culture and knowledge that define all company members.

The operations refer to the processes and procedures that cross the company vertically and horizontally.

The company can obtain a competitive advantage if it can fulfil the processes and activities in a much more efficient manner than its competitors or if it is able to create new ones (Porter 1985).

In this context the key role is filled by the make or buy decisions (Williamson 1985; Porter 1985; Grant 1991; Thompson et al. 2006). It requires clear identification of the strategic processes and activities that cannot be outsourced.

It is worth pointing out that if alignment between the organisational structure and company strategies is necessary. It implies that the organizational structure must be allowed the organizational effectiveness in the direction defined by company strategies.

This alignment must be dynamic since both the internal structure of the company as well as its environmental structure are characterized by dynamic development. Therefore, the relationship between organizational structure and the strategies must be circular rather than linear (Grant 1991). In this sense an optimal organisation context should be defined rather than an optimal organizational structure as it allows for response to a change in the environment.

Definition of the Organization Structure and Operations must be related to the company strategies in its competitive environment. The alignment between strategies and organization and operating model is the result of the bidirectional relationships based on an iterative logic approach (Grant 1991).

# (c) Strategic Resources

The strategic resources of the company refer to the company's tangible and intangible assets and the human skills necessary for their coordination.

The company's strategic resources represent the most important way of competing in the business (Grant 1991; Hamel and Prahalad 1990; Quinn 1992).

Generally, the strategic resources provide the company with uniqueness and are able to protect its competitive advantage from imitation processes by generating "isolation mechanisms" (Rumelt 1987).

Consequently, management of strategic resources over time has the highest strategic relevance for the company. The company-environment paradigm is characterized by high dynamicity and complexity. The company has to acquire a strategic approach able to modify the internal structure faster than competitors by following market changes (Bertini 1995; Coda 1988). The strategic resources allow the company to modify its internal structure by aligning it with business changes. In this sense, the company's policy for the increase and development of its strategic resources must be developed in two main directions:

- focusing attention on the processes of training, accumulation and control of the implemented resources;
- constant re-thinking on the composition of resources by integrating them for their re-vitalization due to the dynamic relationship between company and its environment. The re-thinking of the strategic sources must be made by imagining what resources will be distinctive in the future in order to satisfy market changes.

It is worth noting that the core competences based on strategic sources do not change in core rigidities over time. It happens when strategic resources cannot be renewed in order to follow market changes. In this case the resources able to generate a competitive advantage in a given time become the first cause of company failure.

In this sense, by considering that the strategic resources of the company are the cause and the effect of its competitive advantage, it is necessary to develop and maintain over time a circular relationship between strategic sources and competitive advantage: the competitive advantage of the company is function of its strategic resources that, in turn, are developed over time based on the effects of the strategic choices.

Finally, as far as the company is concerned, it is important to imagine the source that will become distinctive in the future for market changes.

Not all sources can be defined as strategic resources. Not all resources are able to build and defend the company's competitive advantage over time. To be strategic, a resource must be relevant for value creation and must be characterized mainly by:

- scarceness: the higher the source of scarcity, the higher the relevance;
- uniqueness: the higher the ability of the source to generate company's uniqueness, the higher the relevance;
- inimitability: the higher the source inimitability, the higher the relevance;
- capabilities over time: the higher the duration over time of source capabilities, the higher the relevance;
- depreciation: the lower the depreciation rate, the higher the relevance;
- specificity: the higher the number of times of use, the higher the source relevance;
- combinability: the higher the source capability to combine with others, the higher the relevance.

Based on these considerations, tangible assets can rarely be considered as a strategic resource because they can be easily replicated by competitors.

Intangible assets are more difficult to replicate by the competitors than tangible assets due to their specific nature. Generally, they arise from the internal processes of the company and therefore they are unique. Also, unlike tangible assets, their value does not decrease over time and sometimes it increases thanks to use (Grant 1991; Collis et al. 2012).

Human capital (or intellectual capital) refers to the people whose skills, knowledge, culture, ideas and values allow for combination and coordination between tangible and intangible assets in order to achieve the strategic target of the company (Quagli 2001).

In this context, human capital is the main strategic resource for the company (Grant 1991; Itami 1988; Saloner et al. 2001; Thompson et al. 2006) and it represents the real source of the company's competitive advantage. People at all levels of the organization represent the main and deeper reason of strategic thinking and operation of the company as well as its ability to create value over time (Bertini 1995). Therefore, human capital is the most relevant element of diversification among the companies. Consequently, it gives uniqueness and non-imitability to the company's competitive advantage and is defendable over time (Barney 1991; Rumelt 1984; Wernefelt 1984; Hamel and Prahalad 1990; Itami 1988).

# External Front of the Csf

The External Strategic Front (ESF) refers to the structural relationships between the company and external players (Coda 1988; Galeotti 2008; Galeotti and Garzella 2013). These relationships can be exchange related, if they refer to products, services and money, or conditioning if they refer to constraints, limitations and opportunities. Also, they may have both an economic content (revenues, costs, price, etc.) as well as a non-economic content (Galeotti and Garzella 2013). Company competitiveness is due to its ability to create value for all of its players simultaneously.

The external players of the company can be classified into two main groups: business players and financial players. Based on differences in their nature, interests and behaviour, the external strategic front can be divided in two main parts (Coda 1988; Galeotti 2008; Galeotti and Garzella 2013):

(a) Strategic Business Area;
(b) Capital Market.

# (a) Strategic Business Area

Strategic Business Area (SBA) the company refers to the real market in which it carries out the business. The company can operate in more than one business. In any case, any SBA can be defined on the basis of two main elements (Porter 1985):

- competitive players: it refers to the players with which the company defines relationships. Specifically, they are customers, suppliers, competitors (both existing competitors and potential competitors entering the business, as well as the producers of potential substitute products). The relationship between the company and customers is characterized by continuity (due to the sale process) and stability (arising from the possibility to identify a hard core of customers). More and more the relationship between the customers and the company is based on emotional elements that go beyond the technical characteristics of the product. Therefore, the politics of the company with regards to customers are focused on these emotional elements. The relationship between the company and supplier is characterized by continuity (due to the buy process) and stability (deriving from the possibility to identify a hard core of suppliers). The need for the company to achieve and maintain a high-quality level, drives the company to establish strong relationships with suppliers especially if they are considered strategic.

The relationship between the company and competitors, is characterized by continuous and systematic competition in order to acquire and to maintain a competitive advantage. The relationship is based on strategic interaction arising from the dynamic mechanisms of actions-reactions by generating the competitive dynamics in the market and its average profitability.

The interactions among these players define the competitive system in the SBA (Porter 1985);

- product system: it refers to the product offered by the company with regards to its material and immaterial elements, service components and economic and non-economic terms. The product must also incorporate the image and reputation of the company. Therefore, it should be defined as a "product system" rather than a product because it incorporates the technical elements, as well as the image, the value, and the history of the company (Bertini 1990; Coda 1988; Bianchi Martini 2009).

In each SBA the company competes by means of a defined business strategy (De Luca 2013b) in order to satisfy customer requirements and expectations better than competitors. It allows the company to acquire a competitive advantage in the business and greater profitability than competitors (Porter 1985).

The company's business strategy is defined according to its internal characteristics and the structural characteristics of its business area. The company defines its business strategy in order to satisfy customer requirements better than its competitors. In this case the company acquires a competitive advantage in the business, allowing the company to undertake a dominant role in the market and higher profitability than the average level of the market.

If there is more than one SBA, the company has to develop a business strategy for each SBA on the one side and a Multi-Business Strategy on a corporate level in order to coordinate the different business strategies and to define the incoming SBA's, those in which to continue to operate and those from which to exit (Invernizzi 2011; Garzella 2006).

It is worth noting that the competitive advantage of the company is bound to get lost in time due to competition. Therefore, the CSF must be continually renewed over time. In this sense, the company's ability to compete in the business is function to the quality of its strategic thinking rather than a well-defined competitive advantage. Therefore, a dual logic is necessary: on the one hand, the company has to develop its current strategy in order to fulfil a given target; on the other hand, the company has to constantly re-think the strategy for its renewal and development of new future competitive advantages.

The development of a new business strategy must be defined by considering the CSF in its entire structure. It implies that business strategies must be aligned in a dynamic way with internal characteristics of the company and its strategies in the capital markets.

The business strategy must be defined by considering jointly the internal characteristics of the company and the customers' needs and expectations.

Specifically, the business strategy requires the definition of the competitive advantage of the company.

On the basis of analysis of the business structure and characteristics, and by considering the internal characteristics the company must define its competitive advantage to be fulfilled in the business.

Generally, the company acquires a competitive advantage if the product meets the customers' expectations at a higher level than the competitors. The product superiority can be defined on the basis of its material characteristics or emotional characteristics due to its immaterial elements.

It is worth noting that the competitive advantage is specific for the business area and it refers to the product to satisfy customer expectations. It should also be effective and defendable over time by the company.

In this context, the company should correctly evaluate its internal characteristics and the quality of sources available and sources available in a short-time. There are two main competitive advantages that the company can pursue: the cost advantage and the premium-price advantage (Porter 1985).

The cost advantage is fulfilled through a cost strategy that allows for cost structural efficiencies. It is fulfilled whenever the company can create a product at a structural cost (and thus sustainable over time) lower than competitors. The product cost reduction must be achieved without the product quality reduction compared to competitors.

Cost leadership in the business is unique. However, the second leader and the followers can fulfil a cost strategy by obtaining a return on capital investment lower than the cost leader but higher than the market average. The most relevant advantage of the cost leader is that it is also the price leader. The lower price on the market can be defined and therefore it can influence market competition.

The cost strategy can be achieved on the basis of two main directions:

- structural reduction of the cost of processes and activities of the company: in this case the company must manage the cost drivers such as economies of scale, learning processes, access to unique resources, interrelations, integrations, connections, synergies and institutional factors. They usually are combined between them where each one reinforces the other through coordination and maximization;
- reengineering of processes and activities: structural cost reduction requires the re-definition of the company's processes and activities based on a new production method. In this case, it is not pursuing an incremental improvement of the processes and activities with cost reductions, but new processes and activities with a new level of cost.

These two directions can be achieved jointly as well as separately.

Thanks to structural cost reduction, the company can translate this advantage in its price or margin directly.

The cost advantage can be used to:

- reduce the product price: in this case the unit profit margin per product does not change. The price reduction is equal to the cost reduction;
- increase the product unit profit margin: in this case the product price does not change. The reduction in the cost of product increases the profit margin;
- reduce the product price lower than cost reduction: in this case there are the joint effects of the price reduction and the unit profit margin increases.

The price premium advantage is fulfilled through a differentiation strategy. It is only fulfilled if the company is able to differentiate its product and the customers are willing to pay a price (premium-price) higher than that of similar products.

The advantage differentiation is achieved if the company can achieve a price (premium-price) higher than competitors based on higher quality of product. The differentiation strategy is successful only if the premium-price is higher than differentiation costs borne by the company.

The advantage differentiation is based on differentiation drivers. They refer to conditions that give the products its unique nature. Also in this case they usually are related among them and they operate jointly.

The differentiation strategy is more useful, the greater the heterogeneity of customers' needs by requesting non-standard products (Thompson et al. 2006).

The main sources of price-premium are the following:

innovative products: they are protected by patents or, however, they are difficult to copy, or both. Without either two of these protections, the innovative product can be copied and then it is not able to generate high returns over time;
- quality: the product must be characterized by a real or perceived difference with the others and the customers are willing to pay a higher price;
- brand: it refers to product perception of the customers based on the company's brand. The customer choice is based on the brand first of all and then on the

product. However, the price-premium based on brand is difficult to distinguish from the price-premium based on quality. The two are usually highly correlated.

The cost advantage and price premium advantage cannot be achieved jointly. The two strategies are different in their structure and require different product characteristics that can be achieved with different internal structure characteristics of the company.

The company's ability to defend the advantage over time, both cost and premium-price, is function of the quality of the drivers used and their effectiveness in the building of barriers to enter the business.

The choice of a competitive advantage must be made by the company by considering its internal characteristics and the structure and characteristics of the business.

The business structure and characteristics can be defined on the basis of three main pillars (De Luca 2013c):

- market structure;
market cycle-life;
market competitive dynamics.

It is worth noting that each one of them implies a specific business element that the company must evaluate for definition of the business strategy. Indeed, perfect alignment between the business structure and characteristics and the company's business strategy is necessary.

The market structure refers to the level of concentration. The business can be distinguished between: highly concentrated market, fragmented market, niche market.

The highly concentrated market is characterized by few companies with a high market share. There are two main forms: the oligopolistic structure in which there are few big companies but no one is dominant; the structure with a dominant company, is when there is one big company and few smaller companies that share the residual market.

The fragmented market is characterized by a lot of companies with a small market share. In this market competition among the companies is high and the average profit could be low.

The niche market is characterized by customers with homogeneous preferences among them and highly inhomogeneous preferences with all of the others. The market niche is a small part of the market. The competition level in a market niche is usually different from competition in the market.

Once the market structure has been defined, it is necessary to fully understand the stage of the life-cycle in which the market is located. The market cycle-life can be divided into four main phases that are well-known in literature: introduction, development, maturity and decline. Obviously, it is not necessary for the market to cross all of these stages. They represent an ideal scheme of the cycle-life of market.

In this context, it is important to fully understand the stage in which the market is located as each stage is characterised by specific elements that must be considered

in order to define the business strategy of the company in a current and future perspective. There must be coherence between the company's business strategy and the stage of the cycle-life in which the market is located.

In the introduction stage, the business is characterized by a structure that has not yet been fulfilled completely. There is normally radical innovation in the technology of products and/or processes to generate a new business. In this phase, the business is characterized by uncertainty of the product due to low consumer knowledge and then uncertainty in demand and expectations, uncertainty in defensibility of the business in its future development. However, the uncertainty of this phase can also generate positive elements. The absence of clear rules allows for experimentation of the company strategy. The company can acquire a market share due to an increase in demand function of customers' increase, as well as a low competition level (Thompson et al. 2006).

In the development stage, the business is characterized by an increase in demand with regards both to volume and revenues. Transition from the introduction phase to the development phase is usually fast and it generates an increase in competition level in the business. The main problem of the company is to acquire a good position in business as well as to defend it over time. Development of the business attracts new competitors by increasing the competition pressure.

In the maturity stage, the business is characterized by stable demand with regards both to volume and revenues. The market share of companies is normally stable. The competition level among companies is high because the increase in the market share of each company can only be fulfilled through a reduction in that of the others.

In the decline stage, the business is characterized by a structural decline of demand with regards both to volume and to revenues. The product is no longer attractive to customers and it requires regeneration. A new development of the business can only be achieved through its regeneration based on a new concept of product.

Finally, once the market structure and the stage of its lifecycle in which it is located have been defined, it is important to clearly understand the competitive dynamics of the market (De Luca 2013d). Generally, the intensity of the strategic interactions in the business are defined according to the action-reactions scheme among companies. The company must, subsequently, face on the one hand customer expectation and, on the other hand, the strategies of competitors with regards to the same demand. In this sense the company's business strategy must be defined by also considering the effects on the business strategies of its competitors and their reactions. The strategic interactions change among the businesses and for the same business in different times.

Therefore, the company must evaluate its business according to its structural characteristics as well as the intensity of the strategic interaction among the companies.

# (b) Capital Market

Capital Market refers to the ideal place in which a company looks for the capital, in equity and debt, needed for its survival and development over time.

The capital market can be defined according to two main elements:

- financial players: it refers to the investors in equity and debt. The relationship between company and debtholders is of stable nature. The company normally defines a long-term debt level and parts of it are constantly being replaced in the short-term period. The relationship with debtholders becomes complex if the debt level is too high by generating structural financial imbalance. In this case, the debtholders can acquire, directly or indirectly, a role in the company's government with relevant effects on their strategies. The relationship between company and shareholders is of a structural nature. They invest in equity, then they undertake full risk of the company, and they are entrusted the company's government. The relationship undertakes specific characteristics depending on whether or not they are majority or minority shareholders;
- financial company profile: it refers to the risk return profile of the company. It is function of the company's expected cash flows on one side and investor expectations about risk and returns on the other.

In the capital market the company competes through its financial strategy in order to acquire the capital needed, in equity and debt, at profitable conditions (Galeotti 2008).

# Consonance of the Corporate Strategic Formula

The CSF, as defined in its internal and external strategic front, allows for simultaneous optimisation of the company operating in the Strategic Business Area and Capital Market. The internal and the external strategic fronts are strictly connected on the basis of systemic and dynamic bidirectional relationships.

The CSF based on its structural elements as defined, can be schematically represented as in Fig. 1.1.

The internal and external strategic fronts are two parts of a whole. The success of the company is function of their joint quality. They are subsequently strictly connected by systemic and dynamic relationships.

Therefore, the CSF must be characterized by a "consonance" between all structural elements of the internal and external strategic fronts. This consonance must be (De Luca 2013a, De Luca et al. 2017):

- Systemic: all elements of the internal and external strategic fronts must be aligned between them;
- Structural: there must always be correspondence between the characteristics of each element of the strategic fronts, both internal and external, based on well-defined and structural bidirectional relationships;
- Dynamic: the systemic-structural relationships between elements of the internal and external strategic fronts must be dynamic over time and never static.

Fig. 1.1 Corporate strategic formula (CSF)

Therefore, the CSF can be defined as "consonant" only if the relationships between all of its elements can be defined as Systemic-Structural-Dynamic.

The search for consonance must be considered as a strategic approach based on change rather than a specific target to be achieved in a given period of time. Indeed, each element of both internal and external strategic fronts, as well as the relationships between them, change over time because they change the company's environment (business area and capital market) as well as its internal characteristics. The success of the company can never be defined as a given condition in a given time, but as a process of value creation over time (Bertini 1995).

Generally, if there is a difference in speed between internal and external, the faster the external changes than the internal ones, the greater the probability of failure of the company.

Based on this the internal structure of the company allows for the achievement and consolidation of a competitive advantage in the business area and capital market. Specifically, these competitive advantages require continuous adaptations of the internal structure of the company due to the constant changes in the business and capital markets according to the logics of the strategic change.

The success of the company should not be interpreted as a temporary situation but as a way of being. In this sense, rather than representing a target to be achieved at given periods of time, the Systemic-Structural-Dynamic Consonance of the CSF should be considered as a strategic approach based on change.

The internal structure of the company plays a key role in the CSF. It is the ring that connects the business and financial strategies allowing for the creation of a

virtuous circle between them. Specifically, the distinctive resources allow for the ideation, the design and the development of a product system in line with the needs and expectations of customers in a better way than competitors. The ability of the product system to satisfy the critical factors of strategic business area, allows the company to generate, to develop and to defend a competitive advantage over competitors in the SBA over time by generating company value.

The company's ability to generate value in the SBA together with an internal structure characterized by efficiency and effectiveness of the organizational and operating model and by good governance, allows the company to present itself to capital market with a risk-return profile in line with investor expectations. The positive assessment of investors allows the company to generate, to develop and to defend a competitive advantage over competitors in the capital market increasing the company's ability to attract the capital required for its development at profitable conditions.

The company's ability to raise capital increases its investments in SBA. It reinforces its competitive advantage over competitors and increases its value in the business. In turn, the increase in cash-flows increases the company's ability to raise capital in capital markets reinforcing its competitive position. Therefore, it creates a virtuous circle between business areas and capital markets where one increases the other based on an increase of the expected cash-flows.

Finally, the company's ability to raise capital at profitable conditions in the capital markets together with the ability to invest in the business in a profitable way, allows the company to attract and invest in strategic human capital and technologies. It reinforces the internal structure of the company that, in turn, increases the company's ability to generate product systems in line with the changing needs of customers by generating value in the business that, in turn, increases the company's ability to raise capital at profitable conditions in the capital markets to invest in the business.

Therefore, the Systemic-Structural-Dynamic Consonance of the CSF generates a virtuous circle between the internal structure, business and capital markets where the one feed the others. It allows the company to generate, to develop and to defend a competitive advantage in the business by generating value for investors.

It is worth noting that a key role in the company's internal structure is played by the quality of its resources and specifically human resources. They have to change continuously to keep up with environmental changes. It could be a problem on the short-term, because the internal structure elements tend to be stable. Consequently, a company culture based on changing rather than structure change in a given period of time is more effective.

# 1.2 Analytical Schemes for the Analysis of Company Performance

The company's ability to create profit over time requires an analysis based on two main parts:

- the qualitative analysis of the business model;
- the quantitative analysis of the effects of the business model choices on the economic and financial dynamics over time.

These two parts are strictly related. It is not possible to investigate into the company by only considering the analysis of its business model without considering the effects of the strategic choices on the economic and financial dynamics and vice versa (Graham and Dodd 1940).

In the analysis of these two parts jointly, three are the main caveats to keep in mind:

- first, there must always be full consistency between the business model of the firm and its economic and financial dynamics over time. The economic and financial analysis measures the quantitative effects of the business model on economic and financial dynamics with regards to the three dimensions of Operating and Net Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, and Cash-flow from Operations and Cash-flow to Equity. Therefore, while the analysis of the business model is a qualitative analysis, the analysis of economic and financial dynamics is a quantitative analysis. The two types of analysis cannot be separated and they are normally used together in the definition and assessment of the company's business planning. Consequently, an estimate of the expected economic and financial performance must be a coherent and consistent translation of the business model adopted by the company.

In the business planning process, the definition of the business model is the first step, while an estimation of the expected quantitative effects on economic and financial dynamics is the second. Between them there is a two way relationship. If the business model is coherent in all parts, but the expected economic and financial dynamics are not satisfactory, it is necessary to redefine the business model. Only if the business model of the company is coherent in all parts and the expected economic and financial performances are satisfying and the baseline assumptions are individually reliable and coherent with each other, the planning process and the business plan generated can be defined as reliable;

- second, the future is the reference time. The value of the company is function of its ability to generate value in the future. In an analysis of the past, with regards both to the business model adopted and the financial dynamics that it has fulfilled, it is important to understand if the future expectations of the company, as defined in the business model to be implemented and in the estimation of the expected cash-flows, are really reasonable or unreasonable;
- third, the assumptions are the key variable of the forecast. The business model implemented and the estimation of the expected economic and financial dynamics are based on assumptions. Then, the quality of the forecast is function of the quality of the baseline assumptions.

Generally, an analysis of the assumptions requires strict coherence or a reasonable relationship based on personal elements of the company or straightforward to acquire. In this sense, the reference assumptions should be clearly defined for each variable, also in their relationship with other assumptions. Each assumption must be individually reliable and coherent with each other.

The financial analysis of company performance proposed in this context follows a marked financial approach.

In order to simplify the comparison between the past and the future for the same company and between different companies over time, the same analytical schemes should be used. Several analytical schemes should be used. They are defined on the basis of the specific purpose of management according to the decision-making process.

In this contest, the analytical schemes used are defined based on the financial approach to company assessment and they are defined in order to investigate the three main pillars:

- Operating Income and Net Income;
Capital Invested and Capital Structure;
- Free Cash-flow from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity;

While the first defines the economic dynamic, the second and the third define the financial dynamic of the company.

Using the analytical schemes proposed in this context, the following should be borne in mind:

- they are defined with a view to the financial community rather than the accounting one. Therefore, they must not be confused with the schemes used for balance sheet analysis and for definition of the classic accounting ratios. Moreover, terminology is not strictly based on the accounting rules;
- they are strictly connected between them. Therefore, the definition of each one is strictly related to the composition of each other;
- they are defined based on non-financial companies. Furthermore, they can also be used for financial companies after some changes in their structures;
- they are used to analyse the expected future economic and financial dynamics for an estimate of company value. Therefore, their application to past data is necessary to link the past and future in a coherent manner.

Furthermore, for greater understanding of the economic and financial dynamics of the company over time, past values should be aligned with expected future values. The alignment procedure between past and future values regarding Operating and Net Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, and Free

Cash-flows from Operations and Free Cash-flows to Equity, as represented in the analytical schemes used, can be achieved by a procedure based on three main steps:

- the first step, is the collection and recognition of past values: the aim is to build Operating and Net Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, Free Cash-flow from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity of the company in the past. For this objective, the analyses should be based on the balance sheet, income statement and cash flows statement on the one side, and on the internal management accounts of the company on the other side. The combination of these two data sources allows for an analysis of the real condition of the company. An analysis of the management accounts is necessary for three main reasons: (i) they are built to support management in the decision-making phase; (ii) they are characterized by both monetary and non-monetary quantitative data; (iii) they are well known in their composition and dynamics thanks to the technique of the variance analysis implemented constantly;
- the second step, is the "adjustment" of past values: the aim of this step is to obtain the "normalized" value of Operating and Net Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, Free Cash-flow from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity of the company in the past. The aim of the process is to define these values in stand-alone conditions of the company. Therefore, their effects on extraordinary events in the broadest sense are not considered;
- the third step, is the estimate process of value in the future: the aim of this step is to build estimates on Operating and Net Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, Free Cash-flow from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity of the company in the future. A company business plan should be defined in order to achieve this objective. It is created by defining the Company Strategic Formula and by estimating its effects on future economic and financial dynamics.

Based on these three steps, the origin of the company, where it is and where it plans to go, should be clear. Thanks to normalization of the past economic and financial dynamics their values can dialogue with those expected for the future. Consequently, it is easier to highlight the jumps between the past and the future and to evaluate whether or not they can be fulfilled in the future based on the strategies that will be implemented.

The analytical schemes allow for analysis of composition of the Operating and Net Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, Free Cash-flow from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity. An analysis of the economic and financial dynamics requires the definition and the knowledge of the connections between them.

# 1.3 Operating and Net Income

The analysis of the economic dynamic requires an analysis of the Operating Income and Net Income over time. It is the starting point for an analysis of company performance in the business over time.

The aim of the analysis is to investigate into the drivers of the economic engine of the company and the existence of a long-lasting competitive advantage. Specifically, an analysis of costs and revenues over time must be focused on in order to understand if the company has a real competitive advantage and if it lasts over time. The competitive advantage must be identified on the basis of its effects on revenues and costs. Only if the company confirms a dynamic of revenues and costs that is better than that of its competitors for a long period, the company has a lasting competitive advantage over time. Consequently, an analysis of the revenues and costs must consider a long period of time ranging from 7 to 10 years.

The analytical scheme adopted to analyse the income of the company can be divided into four main sections:

- Section (1) Operating area (or Operations section): it refers to the operating revenue and costs due to activities of the company's core business. This is the most important section of income because it defines the economic results of the company's core business. In this section, it is important to distinguish between cash operating costs and non-cash operating costs (such as amortizations, depreciations, accruals);
- Section (2) Non-Operating area (or Non-Operations section): in this section two different types of revenues and costs are considered. The first are the revenues and costs due to the execution of activities different from the company's core business; the second are the revenues and costs related to the core-business but not repeated in time and thus considered as a one-off. It is worth noting that in this context definition of the perimeter of the company core-business is of a strategic assessment only. Therefore, in both cases, the difference between operating and non-operating revenues and costs is based on the strategic analysis only and it is independent of the accounting rules;
- Section (3) Financial area (or Financial section): it refers to the financial revenues and costs. The first refers mainly to the dividend received and interest on financial credit while the second refers mainly to the interest on debt and other financial costs linked to it. Generally, for a non-financial company, the financial revenues are low and the entire financial area refers to the cost of debt;
- Section (4) Tax area (or Tax section): it refers to corporate taxes due to the company activities. Usually, taxes are considered entirely in this part. But, more appropriately, they should be divided among the three sections (Operating, Non-Operating, Financial) as taxes arising from them. Often, in practice tax splitting is difficult to perform and therefore corporate taxes are considered entirely in this specific section.

The aim of the analytical scheme used, as reported in Table 1.1, is to distinguish between strictly operating activities and others it can only be done with a deep analysis of each item in a financial analysis perspective. In this sense, the EBITDA and EBIT refer to Revenues and Costs strictly operating.

The Gross Profit (or Gross Margin) is the difference between the revenues from the sale of products, goods and services and the related production costs.

Table 1.1 Analytical scheme of the Operating and Net Income

Net sales revenue (or more simply net sales) are the starting point. Revenues are the result of the sale of goods and services to customers. The word "net" refers to the difference between gross sales (the total invoice of goods and services) and the sales returns and allowances that refer to the sales value of goods that were returned by customers and reimbursements to customers due to faulty goods or for some other reason related to the product and service. This amount can be subtracted from sales directly.

Sales discounts (referring to the amounts of discounts used by customers for payment) and trade discounts (referring to the amounts of discounts from the actual selling price as published in the official price lists) can be included in net revenues or in commercial costs. If they are included in net revenues, they are not traceable. Otherwise, if they are considered in the commercial costs they are traceable and it is possible to measure the effects of the commercial policy on the revenues. In this contest, for a more in-depth analysis, they are separately considered in the commercial costs.

It is worth noting that at times entrepreneurs look to revenues only to measure their growth. But an increase in revenues does not necessarily imply an increase in profit. If the increase in revenues is accompanied by such a rise in costs, profit does not increase. Similarly, by structurally reducing the costs, profit increases for the same revenues. Therefore, a good company growth requires an increase in profit that can be achieved by increasing the revenues to a greater level than costs, or by structurally reducing the costs for equal or decreasing revenues.

The Direct Operating Cost of Goods or Services Sold (or more simply Cost of Sales or Cost of Goods Sold) refer to the costs due to direct fulfilment of the goods and services sold. Therefore, they can be defined as production costs.

These production costs must be defined on the basis of the type of company with regards to its activities. Three types of companies can be presumed (Anthony, Hawkins, Merchant 2011): (i) merchandising company, (ii) manufacturing company, and (iii) service organization. Before starting the analysis, it can be useful to solve a terminological problem. It is worth noting, that because both merchandising and manufacturing companies sell tangible goods, the term "cost of goods sold" is usually used rather than "cost of sales". However, the two terms can be used interchangeably.

Merchandising companies sell tangible goods. Specifically, they sell goods in substantially the same physical form in which they acquires them. Therefore, its cost of sales is the acquisition costs of goods that are sold. For these companies, the cost of goods sold must consider the merchandise inventory and thus the costs of goods that have been acquired but not yet sold at a defined date. In this case the change in inventory in the cost of goods sold must be considered.

Specifically, the cost of goods sold can be divided into two main parts: (1) purchase cost of the goods (invoice costs) less the goods returned, allowance and discounts, plus any other related costs made to make the goods ready for sale (such as shipping costs, freight-in, unpacking costs, etc.); (2) the inventories with regards to the change between the beginning and the end of inventory. By following the regular inventory method, the cost of goods sold is equal to the purchase of goods plus the beginning of inventory less the end of inventory as follows (Table 1.2).

Table 1.2 Cost of goods sold in merchandising companies

<table><tr><td>Purchase cost of goods</td></tr><tr><td>Other related costs necessary for the sale</td></tr><tr><td>(Goods returns, allowance and discounts)</td></tr><tr><td>Net purchase of goods</td></tr><tr><td>Beginning inventory</td></tr><tr><td>Goods available for sale</td></tr><tr><td>(Ending inventory)</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of goods sold</td></tr></table>

Manufacturing companies sell tangible goods. Specifically, they sell goods after an industrial process by converting raw materials and purchased parts into finished goods. Therefore, its sales costs include conversion costs as well as raw material and parts of goods that it sells. Also in this case it is necessary to consider the inventory in order to define the cost of goods sold. The inventory account can be divided into three main parts: (1) materials inventory, referring to raw materials that are to become a part of the ultimately sellable goods resulting from the manufacturing process. In this case the cost of goods sold is defined as in the case of a merchandise company; (2) work in progress inventory, referring to goods that have started through the manufacturing process but have not yet been finished. The cost is defined as the materials plus the conversion costs incurred on these items up to the end of the accounting period; (3) finished goods inventory, referring to goods that have been manufactured but have not yet been shipped to customers. In this case, the cost of goods sold is based on the total costs incurred in their production. Therefore, the cost of goods sold is defined as in the merchandising company. The only difference is that, in this case the items are recorded at their production cost rather than at their acquisition cost.

Table 1.3 Cost of goods sold in manufacturing company

<table><tr><td>Purchase cost of materials</td></tr><tr><td>Other related costs of materials</td></tr><tr><td>(Materials returns, allowance and discounts)</td></tr><tr><td>Net purchase of materials</td></tr><tr><td>Beginning inventory of materials</td></tr><tr><td>Amount of materials available for use</td></tr><tr><td>(Ending inventory of materials)</td></tr><tr><td>Costs of materials used</td></tr><tr><td>Beginning inventory of work in progress</td></tr><tr><td>Amount available goods available for use</td></tr><tr><td>(Ending inventory amount of work in progress)</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of goods manufactured</td></tr><tr><td>Beginning finished goods inventory</td></tr><tr><td>Total amount of goods available for sale</td></tr><tr><td>(Ending finished goods inventory)</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of goods sold</td></tr></table>

By using the periodic inventory method and by considering all three types of inventory, the cost of goods sold can be defined as follows (Table 1.3).

Service organizations sell intangible services. In this case the cost of sales includes all services needed for the execution of services sold to the clients. There is also an inventory in this case. There are two main types: materials inventories with regards to all of the materials required for production of the service; intangible inventories with regards to the costs of services that have been incurred on behalf of clients but that have not yet been invoiced to clients (as in the case of professional service companies such as legal, consulting, etc.) and thus called jobs in progress or unbilled costs. The service organization, therefore, does not have finished goods inventories.

It is necessary to consider that a company may have other inventory accounts for suppliers apart from the inventory of goods directly involved in the merchandising or manufacturing process. They refer to tangible items that must be consumed during normal operations such as repair parts for equipment, lubricants, etc. Suppliers are generally distinguished from a merchandise company because they are not sold, and they are distinguished from materials because they are not accounted for as an element of the cost of goods manufactured. Also in this case, the logical scheme is equal to merchandising company.

The Costs of production of goods and services and distribution services refers to the all of the costs due to the service production and distribution. It includes both the service for the production of goods and all elements for execution of the service to be sold.

The Cost of direct labour only refers to the costs of workers for the production of goods to be sold.

Therefore, Gross Profit measures the part of revenues that remain after the coverage of production costs that must be used to cover all of the rest. Therefore, it is the heart of the company by measuring the company's ability to perform in the business on the basis of the revenues and production cost of the goods to be sold.

It is important to know that by considering the behaviour of costs on the basis of the output of products, all operating costs can be also defined variable costs. Indeed, all costs of goods sold vary directly and proportionately with volume. Therefore, the Gross Profit can be the Contribution Margin of the company at the same time.

Usually, to acquire more information about Gross Profit, it is defined as a percentage of the Revenues as follows:

$$
G r o s s P r o f i t M a r g i n = \frac {G r o s s P r o f i t}{\text {N e t O p e r a t i n g R e v e n u e s}} \tag {1.1}
$$

The Gross Profit Margin is a good preliminary indicator of the existence of a competitive advantage of the company. Normally, companies with a competitive advantage are characterized by a Gross Profit Margin higher than competitors over time. Without a competitive advantage, the competition reduces the Gross Profit Margin of the company.

A general rule (practical rather than scientific) assumes that the company is characterised by Gross Profit Margin (Buffet and Clark 2008):

- equal or higher than  $40\%$  continuously over time: it has some kind of competitive advantage;
- lower than  $40\%$ : the business of the company is characterized by a high level of competition, reducing the company's profitability;
equal or lower than  $20\%$ : the business of the company is characterized by a very high level of competition where no company is characterized by a competitive advantage on competitors sustainable over time. If the company in this type of business does not have a competitive advantage, it normally has a low level of profitability.

In order to understand further the Gross Profit Margin, a historical track record can be used considering a range between 7 and 10 years. The competitive advantage must exist and it must be sustainable over time. In this sense, the key word about the competitive advantage is "continuity" over time.

The EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) is equal to the difference between operating revenues and direct and indirect operating costs (cash) due to the execution of the core business activities.

The operating costs positioned between the Gross Profit and the EBITDA can be defined as the hard costs of the company and they refer to the operating costs required for company operations; without them there is no company and there is no product. Specifically, they are the first components of the hard costs while the second refers to the non-cash operating costs.

These costs can be aggregated in several ways. In this context, they are grouped according to their relevance. Their relevance can be defined on the basis of two main parameters:

- first, with regards to an increase in the company's ability to compete in the business: in this sense, the costs of goods with regards to the production function are defined (Vernimmen et al. 2014) as well as the costs of research and development with regards to the function of research and development, marketing and sales costs with regards to the commercial function and finally, administration costs with regards to all of the other functions of the company including advisors;
- second, with regards to their relevance in terms of amount: in this sense, employee costs and leasing and rental costs are defined as well as other general operating costs that are not relevant in terms both of function and amount.

The amount of operating costs can be very different among the companies due to the specific characteristics of the business.

The relevance of these costs can be measured on the basis of the EBITDA percentage of net operating revenues or on Gross Profit.

Generally, if the market is characterized by a high level of competition and if the company does not have a defined competitive advantage, these costs tend to be high. Generally, these costs absorb between 30 and  $70\%$  of the Gross Profit. If it is equal or lower than  $30\%$  over time, the company can be considered as

high-performing. Otherwise, the closer it get to  $100\%$  the worse the condition of the company.

The EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) is the net operating income because it incorporates non-cash operating costs such as amortization, depreciation and accruals. These non-cash operating costs define the second part of the hard costs and define the distance between EBITDA and EBIT.

There are two main elements with regards to the difference between EBITDA and EBIT that should be kept in mind:

- amortization and depreciation: the distance between EBITDA and EBIT can be a measurement of the investment policy in intangible and tangible assets of the company. The higher the investments in assets, the greater the amortizations and depreciations, and then the greater the distance between EBITDA and EBIT. In a dynamic perspective, the reduction of this distance over time due to lower amortization and depreciation, indicates the reduction of the company's investments in the business. Over time, a reduction of investments in assets generates a reduction of the company's ability to compete in its business and therefore a reduction in both operating and net expected income and consequently a reduction of the company's value creation.

If the company invests in operating and non-operating assets, and the investments in non-operating assets are so important as to disturb reading of the EBIT, the amortization and depreciation relate these non-operating assets can be located out of the EBT-Operating. In this case, it is necessary to distinguish between amortization and depreciation operating and non-operating.

accruals for risk and charges: the distance measures the risks undertaken by the company in time. In a dynamic perspective, relevance is mainly due to the probability that they are not enough to cover future costs if they will be executed. Generally, the greater the provision for risk and charges, the higher the probability that the events referenced may be fulfilled and therefore, the higher the risk that they will not be enough. Therefore, the real problem is to understand if the provisions are enough to cover the costs derived from execution of the future events considered to be feasible.

It is worth noting that the difference between EBITDA and EBIT is relevant in the economic perspective only. Indeed, in the financial perspective they are equal because non-cash operating costs do not affect cash flows.

Finally, it is worth noting that by using tax splitting and therefore by distinguishing between operating and corporate taxes (the first are due to the operating activities, while the second are due to the non-operating and financial activities), EBIT is equal to NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Taxes). Otherwise, if tax splitting is not used and operating taxes as well as corporate taxes are considered jointly in the tax area, EBIT is the operating income before taxes while the NOPAT is the operating income after taxes.

The EBT (Earnings Before Taxes) defines the operating income before corporate taxes. If there are non-operating revenues and costs, it could be interesting to

highlight the components of EBT that refer to the operating revenues and costs only by defining the EBT-Operating.

If there are no non-operating revenues and costs, the difference between EBIT and EBT is due to the financial revenues and costs. Generally, the difference is mainly due to debt costs. Then the distance between EBIT and EBT indirectly measures the relevance and the risk level of debt in the capital structure: the greater the distance, the higher the costs on debt and therefore the higher the amount and the risk level of debt in the capital structure.

The Net Income is due to the difference between EBT and the corporate taxes. The Net Income is frequently expressed per share of equity, that is Earnings per Share.

It is worth noting that usually the final performance of the company is measured on the basis of the EBT rather than the Net Income. It allows for a comparison of different companies in different countries and therefore subject to different taxes.

It is worth noting that the "congruity" of the company's Net Income for the investor in equity is measured in the financial markets according to the return request by investor for the same risk-class. Part 2 of the book focuses on this analysis.

# 1.4 Capital Invested and Capital Structure

The aim of the analysis of the Capital Invested and Capital Structure is to investigate into the sources of capital and their use.

The Capital Invested (CI) defines the amount of capital invested in company activities, while the Capital Structure (CS) defines the sources of capital used to finance these activities.

The aim of the analytical scheme proposed is to highlight the main figures whose variations can be interpreted in terms of cash-flows immediately and therefore whose previsions are relevant for company value. The analytical scheme proposed is based on separation between financial and non-financial assets-liabilities and, with regards to this second category between operating and surplus assets-liabilities with regards to those that are not linked with operating activities. There are two main implications of these separations:

- first, they allow for definition of the investments directly in company's assets, both operating and surplus as well as relative capital sources;
- second, they allow for an assessment of variations in the assets-liabilities directly in terms of changes in cash flows.

Table 1.4 illustrates the analytical scheme used for analysis of the Capital Invested and Capital Structure.

The Capital Invested (CI) consists of investments in Capex, Net Working Capital, Surplus Assets, less Provisions. The Capital Structure (CS) is defined by Equity and Net Financial Debt.

Specifically, the sum of Capex and Net Working Capital (of which the Trade Working Capital is the difference between trade receivables and trade payables only) defines the Net Operating Capital Invested (NOCI). It is the capital invested in the operating assets fixed and working. The total of NOCI and Surplus Assets (that is the amount of capital invested in non-operating assets fixed and working) defines capital invested in all assets of the company both operating and non-operating. The difference between the capital invested in all assets and Provisions defines the Capital Invested (CI). It is important to note that the CI is net of Provisions. In this sense it can be also defined as Net Capital Invested.

Also if the Provisions can be considered as debt, in this context they are considered in the Capital Invested with a negative sign in order to define the Capital Structure based only on the two main capital sources: Equity and Financial Debt.

This analytical scheme allows for the definition of capital invested to be financed costly in terms of debts and equity.

The CAPEX (Capital Expenditures) refers only to the operating investments. Therefore, it can be defined as Net Operating Capital Expenditures and it represents the investments needed for the execution of Operating Income.

They refer mainly to the operating investments in fixed assets (tangible and intangible) of the company necessary to execute the products sold in the business net of their amortization and depreciation funds.

Investments in Financial Assets are included in the Capex only if they have a strategic industrial relevance. Otherwise, the investments for fulfilment of financial income are included in the Surplus Assets that includes non-operating investments.

Sometimes, the Capex also includes the inventory. If the company needs a constant and stable stock of inventories in order to guarantee production activity (stocks of raw materials, semi-finished and finished products) and to satisfy customer requirements in time (stocks of goods to be sold), it represents a stable investment. Therefore, part of the inventories that in monetary value must be stable in the company for the needs of the business can be approximated to an investment in tangible assets and therefore it is included in the Capex.

The Net Working Capital (NWC) refers to the investments in working capital of the company arising from repetitive operations (cycle of buying, processing, sales). It is equal to the difference between current assets and current liabilities arising from the company's operating activities. Therefore, it does not include financial and surplus assets and liabilities (with regards to non-operating company activities). Specifically, the NWC consists of:

- Trade Working Capital (TWC): it is the difference between trade receivables and trade payables arising from the trade activities of the business with customers and suppliers. The trade receivables are net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt:
- Inventories: it is the value of the inventory in a time  $t$ . They can be assessed based on FIFO (first in, first out), LIFO (last in, first out) and the Weighted Average.
- Other operating receivables less other operating payables: they refer to the receivables and payables arising from operating activities of the company different from the strictly trade (grouped in Trade Working Capital) and the financial receivables and payables (grouped in Net Financial Position).

The NWC entity is function of the operating income with regards to the operating revenues and costs on the one side, and the time of cash-in and cash-out of the operating revenues and costs on the other side. Therefore, the higher the NWC, the higher the receivables and inventories than payables, and therefore the lower the cash-in. On the contrary, the lower the NWC, the lower the receivables and inventories that payables, and therefore the higher the cash-in.

The NWC measures the resources used in operating current activities. Therefore, presuming equal revenues, the higher the NWC, the greater are the financial needs. In this case, the receivables increase and the lack of cash-in with their displacement in the future time, increases the financial needs to cover the cash-out.

It is worth noting that in ordinary conditions NWC is always positive. If it is negative, debts are higher than credits, and therefore the company funds its activities by using debts. It can be considered a degenerated condition of the firm.

The Surplus Assets (SA) refers to the investments in a non-operating area. It consists of:

- tangible and intangible assets for the creation of non-operating activities leading to the non-operating income;
- financial assets, such as shares and financial credits, leading to the financial income;
- receivables and payables due to the time of cash-in and cash-out related to the non-operating revenues and costs.

The Provisions refer to the funds accrued for risks and charges, for employees and for taxes. They refer to the amount of costs accrued but not paid, that will be paid in the future for execution of the reference event.

In this context, they are registered in the Capital Invested (CI) with a negative sign. They can be interpreted as obligations deriving directly from the operating area. It includes:

- provision for employees: it represents costs achieved but not liquidated yet due to legal constraints. Therefore, they are part of the operating costs with deferred payments;
- provision for taxes: it refers to taxes in company activities matured but not yet liquidated. If there is contemporaneity between tax maturity and tax payment, there are no provisions;
- provision for risks and charges: it refers to the costs accrued for company activities executed but whose negative effects will be in the future. Therefore, they represent costs deriving from company activities.

In order to provide a clear picture without damaging the NWC, the provisions can be presented separately and away from the Surplus Assets.

An introduction of the provisions in the Capital Invested (with a negative sign), allows for definition of the Capital Structure based only on the two main capital sources: Equity and Net Financial Debt.

Nevertheless, they can be considered as debt for the company and thus as financial sources. In this case, they are considered in the Capital Structure (CS). Specifically, it is easy to presume the provisions for the employees as company financing from employees. It is a fund based on the payment matured for the employees but that will be paid in the future. Similarly, the provision for taxes, refers to the payments matured that will be paid in the near future. Therefore, they represent a debt for the company. Finally, provisions for risk and charges, refer to the payments that probably will be made in the future based on current events. Therefore, they can be considered as a debt in order to the future payments matured now.

The Equity refers to the personal sources of the company. There are two main types:

capital invested by the stockholders;
- self-financing of the company due to the cash-flows generated and not distributed in dividends form, by increasing reserves.

The Net Financial Position (NFP) refers to the net financial debt of the company. It is equal to the difference between financial debts only (both long and short term) and liquidity, marketable assets and financial credits. The NFP can be divided in two parts:

- Long-term NFP: it is equal to the difference between long-term financial debt and long-term financial credit;
- Short-term NFP: it is equal to the difference between short-term financial debt and the sum of short-term financial credits, marketable assets and liquidity.

The non-financial debts are included in the NWC. Therefore, the NFP's construction requires the NWC's construction jointly. It is not possible to define the NFP without defining jointly the NWC.

The general equation on capital requires that the Capital Invested (CI) must be equal to the Capital Structure (CS), as follows:

$$
C I = C S \tag {1.2}
$$

and then:

$$
\text {C A P E X} \pm N W C \pm \text {S u r p l u s A s s e t s} - \text {P r o v i s i o n s} = \text {E q u i t y} + N F P \tag {1.3}
$$

It is important to note that Net Financial Position (NFP) plays a central role in the equation. There are two main caveats to be kept in mind.

First, the NFP defines the net financial debt (financial debt less the sum of financial credit, marketable securities and liquidity). Therefore, the company's Leverage (L), can be measured on the basis of the Net Financial Position (NFP) (and thus by considering its net financial debt) or the financial debt (FD) as follows:

$$
L (\%) = \frac {N F P}{E + N F P} = \frac {N F P}{C S} \quad \text {or} \quad L (\%) = \frac {F D}{E + F D} \tag{1.4}
$$

Therefore, only in the first case the denominator is the Capital Structure (CS). In the second case it is not the CS because it creates a misalignment between Net Working Capital and Net Financial Position and, consequently between Capital Invested and Capital Structure.

Second, the Net Financial Position (NFP) can be defined as a "mobile" item. It can be considered as a source of capital and then classified in the Capital Structure or as an investment and then classified in the Capital Invested.

Specifically, the Net Financial Position (NFP) can be:

- negative: the financial debts are greater than the sum between financial credits, marketable securities and liquidity. In this case, the NFP is a source of capital and then it is classified in the Capital Structure and:

$$
C A P E X \pm N W C \pm \text {S u r p l u s A s s e t s} - \text {P r o v i s i o n s} = \text {E q u i t y} + \text {N F P} \tag {1.5}
$$

- positive: the financial debts are lower than the sum between financial credits, marketable securities and liquidity. In this case, the NFP is an investment and then it is classified in the Capital Invested and:

$$
\text {C A P E X} \pm N W C \pm \text {S u r p l u s A s s e t s} - \text {P r o v i s i o n s} + N F P = \text {E q u i t y} \tag {1.6}
$$

# 1.5 Free Cash Flow from Operations and Free Cash Flow to Equity

The aim of the analysis of the Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO) and Free Cash-flow to Equity (FCFE) is to investigate into how the operating cash flows and dividends over time are defined.

It is based on an analysis of cash-in and cash-out arising from the company's activities leading to the Free Cash-flow from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity.

The definition of cash-flows is based on the items related to the Operating and Net Income on the one side, and the items related to the Capital Invested and Capital Structure on the other side, must be considered in different way.

The items of Operating and Net Income must be considered with regards to their value in the same year of the cash-flows determination and with the same sign. Therefore, for the definition of cash-flow in time  $t_1$  revenues and costs must be considered at the same time  $(t_1)$  as follows:

- revenues: all different types of revenues (operating, non-operating and financial) generate cash-in;
- costs: all types of costs (operating, non-operating, financial and taxes) generate cash-out. Only the non-cash operating costs (amortization, depreciation and accruals) must not be considered because they do not generate cash-flow movements.

The items of Capital Invested and Capital Structure must be considered with regards to their changes between two different years. Therefore, for the definition of the cash-flow in time  $t_1$  the change of the item between  $t_0$  and  $t_1$  must be considered.

For cash-flow determination, each item of Capital Invested and Capital Structure must be considered according to the movements in terms of cash-flow regardless of their nature, as follows:

- credit: it is the same for trade receivable net, other operating receivable net, other non-operating receivables, financial credits (short and long term). The cash-flow movement is the following:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \downarrow (\uparrow) \Delta C r e d i t s \Rightarrow \downarrow (\uparrow) C a p i t a l I n v e s t e d \Rightarrow \uparrow (\downarrow) C a s h I n \Rightarrow \uparrow (\downarrow) C a s h F l o w s \\ \downarrow (\uparrow) \Delta \text {F i n a n c i a l C r e d i t s} \Rightarrow \uparrow (\downarrow) \text {N e t F i n a n c i a l P o s i t i o n} \Rightarrow \uparrow (\downarrow) \text {C a s h I n} \\ \Rightarrow \uparrow (\downarrow) C a s h F l o w s \\ \end{array}
$$

- debt: it is the same for the trade payable, other operating payable, other non-operating payable, financial debts (short and long term). The cash-flow movement is the following:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \downarrow (\uparrow) \Delta D e b t s \Rightarrow \uparrow (\downarrow) C a p i t a l I n v e s t e d \Rightarrow \downarrow (\uparrow) C a s h I n \Rightarrow \downarrow (\uparrow) C a s h F l o w s \\ \downarrow (\uparrow) \Delta \text {F i n a n c i a l D e b t s} \Rightarrow \downarrow (\uparrow) \text {N e t F i n a n c i a l P o s i t i o n} \Rightarrow \downarrow (\uparrow) \text {C a s h I n} \\ \Rightarrow \downarrow (\uparrow) C a s h F l o w s \\ \end{array}
$$

- inventory: it is the same for the inventory and inventory stable over time. The cash-flow movement is the following:

$$
\downarrow (\uparrow) \Delta I n v e n t o r i e s \Rightarrow \downarrow (\uparrow) C a p i t a l I n v e s t e d \Rightarrow \uparrow (\downarrow) C a s h I n \Rightarrow \uparrow (\downarrow) C a s h F l o w s
$$

- Net Assets: it is the same for the tangible and intangible assets. The cash-flow movement is the following:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta \left[ \text {N e t A s s e t} _ {t + 1} - \left(\text {N e t A s s e t} _ {t} \pm \text {C h a n g e V a l u e} _ {t + 1} - \text {A m o r t i z a t i o n} _ {t + 1}\right) \right] \\ \Rightarrow \left\{ \begin{array}{l} = 0 \Rightarrow \downarrow \text {C a p i t a l I n v e s t e d} \Rightarrow \text {C a s h F l o w s} = 0 \\ > 0 \Rightarrow \uparrow \text {C a p i t a l I n v e s t e d} \Rightarrow \text {C a s h O u t} \Rightarrow \downarrow \text {C a s h F l o w s} \\ <   0 \Rightarrow \downarrow \text {C a p i t a l I n v e s t e d} \Rightarrow \text {C a s h I n} \Rightarrow \uparrow \text {C a s h F l o w s} \end{array} \right. \\ \end{array}
$$

- Financial Assets: it is the same for the financial assets operating and non-operating. The cash-flow movement is the following:

$$
\uparrow (\downarrow) \Delta \text {F i n a n c i a l A s s e t} \Rightarrow \uparrow (\downarrow) \text {C a p i t a l I n v e s t e d} \Rightarrow \downarrow (\uparrow) \text {C a s h I n} \Rightarrow \downarrow (\uparrow) \text {C a s h F l o w s}
$$

It is worth noting that if the increase of financial asset is due to a reassessment of the asset, there is no cash-out but the increase of a reserve in equity. In this case, this reserve is not considered in the determination of dividends. Similarly, if the decrease of financial assets is due to the reduction in value, there is no cash-out but operating no-cash costs. In these cases, the movements of the financial assets can be summarized as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta \left[ \text {F i n a n c i a l A s s e t} _ {t + 1} - \left(\text {F i n a n c i a l A s s e t} _ {t} \pm \text {C h a n g e V a l u e} _ {t + 1}\right) \right] \\ \Rightarrow \left\{ \begin{array}{l} = 0 \Rightarrow \uparrow \text {C a p i t a l I n v e s t e d} \Rightarrow \text {C a s h F l o w s} = 0 \\ > 0 \Rightarrow \uparrow \text {C a p i t a l I n v e s t e d} \Rightarrow \text {C a s h O u t} \Rightarrow \downarrow \text {C a s h F l o w s} \\ <   0 \Rightarrow \downarrow \text {C a p i t a l I n v e s t e d} \Rightarrow \text {C a s h I n} \Rightarrow \uparrow \text {C a s h F l o w s} \end{array} \right. \\ \end{array}
$$

- Provisions: it is the same for provisions for risks and charges, taxes and for employees. The cash-flow movement is the following:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Delta \left[ \text {P r o v i s i o n} _ {t + 1} - \left(\text {P r o v i s i o n} _ {t} + \text {A c c r u a l s} _ {t + 1}\right) \right] \\ \Rightarrow \left\{ \begin{array}{l} = 0 \Rightarrow \downarrow \text {C a p i t a l I n v e s t e d} \Rightarrow \text {C a s h F l o w s} = 0 \\ <   0 \Rightarrow \uparrow \text {C a p i t a l I n v e s t e d} \Rightarrow \text {C a s h O u t} \Rightarrow \downarrow \text {C a s h F l o w s} \end{array} \right. \\ \end{array}
$$

- Equity: only the changes achieved in monetary terms must be considered. The cash-flow movement is the following:

$$
\begin{array}{c} \uparrow (\downarrow) \Delta E q u i t y i n m o n e y \Rightarrow \uparrow (\downarrow) C a p i t a l S t r u c t u r e \Rightarrow \uparrow (\downarrow) C a s h I n \Rightarrow \\ \uparrow (\downarrow) C a s h F l o w s \end{array}
$$

- Liquidity: it is the same for the marketable securities, cash and cash equivalents. The cash-flow movement is the following:

$$
\begin{array}{c} \uparrow (\downarrow) \Delta \text {L i q u i d i t y} \Rightarrow \downarrow (\uparrow) \text {N e t F i n a n c i a l P o s i t i o n} \Rightarrow \downarrow (\uparrow) \text {C a s h I n} \Rightarrow \\ \downarrow (\uparrow) \text {C a s h F l o w s} \end{array}
$$

It is important to know that the movements of liquidity, and therefore its effects on Net Financial Position and Free Cash-flow to Equity, refer to the amount of capital that the company wants to invest in Liquidity as measured at the end of the period analysed. Therefore, all movements on liquidity used to balance all other movements on items that generate cash-in and cash-out, they are transitory only.

The cash-flows movements due to Operating and Net Income and Capital Invested and Capital Structure, can be summarized in an analytical scheme, as reported in Table 1.5 as follows:

The main items that must be investigated are:

- Free Cash Flow from Operations (FCFO): they are the Free Cash-flows from Operating Area as derived by the company's operating activities and they are designed to pay all investors both in equity and debt. They represent the monetary component of the Operating Income of the company. Therefore, the FCFF is function of the Operating Income (there is no difference between EBITDA and EBIT because the non-monetary costs are not considered) and dynamics in the NWC and CAPEX. They are defined "free" because they represent the cash that the company is free to distribute to debtholders and shareholders and to pay taxes by having already covered the needs for Investments and NWC;
- Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE): they are the remaining free cash flows after having covered all company requirements including payments on debt, and therefore they are designed to pay the shareholders in terms of dividends. They represent the monetary component of the net income of the company. They show how the FCFF's are divided between bondholders, stockholders and taxes. If the FCFE are negative, they represent the company's capital need to continue its business. Therefore, it is the amount of the capital required for recapitalization.
