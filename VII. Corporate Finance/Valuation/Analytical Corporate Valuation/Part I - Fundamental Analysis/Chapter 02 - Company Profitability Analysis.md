# Chapter 02 - Company Profitability Analysis

**Abstract.** In this second step of the fundamental company analysis, attention is focused on the company's profitability measurements. Several tools can be used. The choice is usually based on an analysis perspective and its nature. In this context a financial perspective is followed. The analysis is developed on three main fronts:

- analysis of the economic and financial dynamics over time. The analysis can start from each economic and financial figure. In this context, it can be useful to start the analysis from capital sources and their investment in the company's activities and to measure their returns in terms of earnings and dividends;
- the analysis of the main financial ratios. There are many well-known ratios in literature. In this context the most commonly used financial ratios used in the financial community are considered. They are able to complete the analysis because they are in line with the analytical schemes regarding Operating and Net Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, Free Cash-flow from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity;
- the analysis of the growth rate. The fundamental company analysis leads to investigate into the expected consistency of future economic and financial dynamics. Consequently, one of the most relevant key of the analysis is the estimate of the company's future growth rate with regards mainly to both Net Income and Operating Income.

## 2.1 Analysis of Economic and Financial Dynamics

The analytical schemes showed in the previous chapter focus on the definition of the Operating and Net Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, and Free Cash-flow from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity.

The analysis can start from each of them. In this context, it may be useful to start the analysis from the sources of capital and their investment in company's activities and to measure their returns in terms of earnings and dividends.

Equity and debt are the two sources of capital to finance company activities.

Equity refers to the shareholders source of capital. It can be increased through new capital or self-financing.

Equity must be repaid by dividends. Therefore, the equity remuneration is residual because it is achieved after the repayment of all production factors only in the case of specific conditions.

Debt in capital structure refers to the financial debt only. Usually, more specifically it refers to the Net Financial Position (NFP) that it is equal to the difference between financial debts (both long and short) and liquidity (equal to the sum between financial credits, marketable securities and cash) as proposed in the analytical scheme in the previous chapter. Therefore, the increase (decrease) of financial debt increases (decreases) the Net Financial Position.

Financial debt generates financial costs mainly in terms of interest on debt. It represents the debt holders' remuneration and then the cost of debt. It is located between EBIT and EBT by reducing it. It also generates a cash-out with negative effects on the Free Cash-flow to Equity (FCFE).

It is important to point out that if financial costs are not paid, they generate new financial debt to be added to the original one.

Finally, it is important to point out that the increase in financial debt increases the Net Financial Position and it increases the Free Cash-flow to Equity (FCFE).

The sum between equity and financial debt defines the Capital Structure of the company. Capital sources are invested in assets, both operating and non-operating, Net Working Capital and Liquidity in order to achieve company activities.

## Investments in Operating Assets

They can be distinguished in operating capital expenditure (Capex) and in Net Working Capital (NWC).

Their total defines the Net Operating Capital Invested (NOCI). Consequently, the increase in operating assets increase investments in NOCI and then it increases the amount of Capital Invested (CI).

Investments in Operating Capital Expenditure (Capex) refer to investments in operating assets strictly such as operating tangible, intangible, financial assets, and inventory stable over time.

The main aim of these investments is to increase the EBITDA over time. It can be achieved by increasing operating revenues (through the increase of production capacity) and by decreasing operating costs (through the increase of technology efficiency) over time.

The positive effect on EBITDA is contrasted by the negative effect on EBIT due to the amortization and depreciation related to investments in tangible and intangible assets. Therefore, the increase of investments increases the distance between EBITDA and EBIT

Finally, the investments in Capex generate cash-out with negative effects on Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO). However, it is important to consider that the increase in Capex should increase the EBITDA by pushing up the FCFO over time. The main problem is related to the time of these two movements: while the cash-outs are immediate, the increase in EBITDA should be achieved in the near future.

Note that investments in operating financial assets can generate operating financial revenues with a positive effect on EBT-Operating.

Financial assets can be subject to the impairment test. The main problem concerns the difference between their market value and book value: if the first is greater than the second, the company can increase asset value through its revaluation; otherwise if the first is lower than the second, the company must decrease the asset value. In both cases there are no cash movements and they affect the EBIT. Note that the same effects concern the change in value of tangible and intangible assets.

Investments in Net Working Capital (NWC) refer to the investments in operating receivables and payables and inventory. The operating receivables and payables refer to the operating revenues and costs that they do not generate cash-in and cash-out yet. The inventory refers to the products created but not yet sold.

Specifically, sales revenues produce trade receivables while costs of goods sold generate trade payables. The difference between them defines the Trade Working Capital (TWC): if the first is higher than the second, the TWC increases; otherwise, if the second is higher than the first, the TWC decreases. The TWC is the main part of the NWC. Therefore, the increase (decrease) in TWC increases (decreases) the NWC.

On the other hand, other operating revenues and costs produce other operating receivables and payables. These operating receivables and payables plus inventory define the second part of the NWC. Therefore, if the other operating receivables plus inventory are greater than the other operating payables, the NWC increases; otherwise, if other operating payables are greater than other operating receivables plus inventory, the NWC decreases.

The increase in NWC (due to the increase in TWC, other operating receivables and inventory and decrease of other operating payables) increases the Net Operating Capital Invested (NOCI) and subsequently the amount of Capital Invested (CI); otherwise, the decrease of NWC (due to the decrease in TWC, other operating receivables and inventory and increase of other operating payables) decreases the Net Operating Capital Invested (NOCI) and subsequently the amount of Capital Invested (CI).

The increase and decrease in NWC over time have direct effects on cash-flows. In cash-flow terms the increase (decrease) of receivables (both trade and other operating) and inventory are considered cash-out (cash-in) while the increase (decrease) of payables (both trade and other operating) are considered cash-in (cash-out). Therefore, the increase in NWC can be considered a cash-out and it subsequently reduces the Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO); otherwise, the decrease in NWC can be considered as a cash-in and then it increases the Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO).

## Investments in Non-operating Assets

They refer to the investments in Surplus Assets. It is possible to distinguish between investments in tangible, intangible and financial Surplus Assets, and investments in non-operating and non-current operating receivables and payables.

The investments in Surplus Assets are not considered in Net Operating Capital Invested (NOCI). Therefore, they increase the amount of Capital Invested (CI) only.

Investments in tangible and intangible and financial Surplus Assets refer to the investments in non-core business activities. The amortization and depreciation of intangible and tangible Surplus Asset are located between EBT-Operating and EBT. The main reasoning for this positioning is not to damage the EBIT. In this way, the EBIT can be considered strictly operating.

Investments in tangible and intangible Surplus Assets can affect the non-operating revenues and costs that they affect the EBT.

Investments in financial Surplus Assets can generate non-operating financial revenues. They have a positive effect on EBT.

Similarly, the investments in financial assets computed in Capex, are subject to the impairment test. In this case the change in value has direct effects on the EBT. The same effect on EBT is due to the change in value of tangible and intangible Surplus Assets.

In cash-flow terms, investments in Surplus Assets (tangible, intangible, financial) generates cash-out with negative effect on Free Cash-flow to Equity (FCFE). Indeed, they are not considered in Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO) because they are non-operating.

Investments in non-operating and non-current operating receivables and payables refer to the investments in non-operating and non-current operating revenues and costs that have not yet been translated into cash-in and cash-out.

They are not considered in NWC because they refer to the revenues and costs not related to the core-business of the company.

If the non-operating and non-current operating receivables are higher than the non-operating and non-current operating payables, the Surplus Asset increases; otherwise, if the non-operating and non-current operating receivables are lower than the non-operating and non-current operating payables, the Surplus Asset decreases.

In cash-flow terms, the increase (decrease) of non-operating and non-current operating receivables can be considered as cash-out (cash-in) and the increase (decrease) of non-operating and non-current operating payables can be considered cash-in (cash-out). Therefore, the increase in Surplus Assets is a cash-out and therefore it reduces the Free Cash-flow to Equity (FCFE); otherwise, the decrease in Surplus Assets is a cash-in and thus it increases the Free Cash-flow to Equity (FCFE). Also, in this case the Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO) are not affected because they are not related to the core-business.

## Investment in Liquidity

Specific reasoning must be reserved to investments in Liquidity. It refers to the amount of cash, cash equivalent, financial credits and marketable securities that a company decides to maintain in the company. Therefore, it is not a capital source but capital invested because it is an investment decision. Indeed, liquidity is positioned in the Net Financial Position by reducing its value.

It is necessary to distinguish between: (i) the temporary movements of Liquidity, that they are due to the effect of cash-in and cash-out used to balance the movements of other items; (ii) the investment in Liquidity that defines the level of liquidity that company wants to maintain over time. Only the second type can be considered as a proper investment.

Liquidity can generate operating and non-operating financial revenues with positive effects on EBT and Free Cash-flow to Equity (FCFE).

In cash-flow terms, it can be considered as a cash-out. Therefore, the increase in Liquidity reduces the Free Cash-flow to Equity (FCFE).

## Provisions

Finally, it is necessary to consider Provisions for risk and charges, taxes and employees. They reduce the Capital Invested (CI).

Accruals for provisions (employees, taxes, risk and charges) are located in the operating costs (non-cash). Therefore, they have direct effects on EBIT.

In cash-flow terms, they only have effects if they are really used with consequent cash-out by reducing the Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO).

## 2.2 Financial Ratios Analysis

The analysis of economic and financial dynamics can be improved by using some ratios. There are many ratios well-known in literature (Benninga 2014; Brealey et al. 2016; Berk and DeMarzo 2008; Damodaran 2012, 2015; Vernimmen et al. 2014; Hillier et al. 2016; Koller et al. 2015; Copeland et al. 2004; Fuller and Farrell 1987; Ross 2015). In this context the most commonly used Financial Ratios in the financial community are considered. They are able to complete the analysis because they are in line with the analytical schemes regarding Operating and Net Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, Free Cash-flow from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity.

It is worth noting that the most significant problem about ratios is the possibility to use different sources. If it happens, use of the same formula is not enough to ensure comparable results. Thus, it is necessary to standardize the data before using the ratios.

Use of the same analytical schemes over the time together with the normalization process of past data and the rebalance between them and the expected future data, allows for data standardisation.

Also, it allows for outlining of the relationships among the economic and financial dynamics as defined. To this end, the Financial Ratios used in this context can be summarized as in Fig. 2.1.

Figure 2.1 can be read starting from one of three dimensions: income (Operating Income and Net Income), capital (Capital Invested and Capital Structure), cash-flows (Free Cash-flow from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity).

Fig. 2.1 Financial ratios

However, it is common use to start the analysis with the economic dynamic. In this sense, the following relationships can be analysed:

- Section 1: Operating Revenues, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, and Free Cash-flow from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity;
- Section 2: Operating Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, and Free Cash-flow from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity;
- Section 3: Net Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, and Free Cashflow from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity;
- Section 4: Capital Invested and Capital Structure, and Free Cash-flow from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity.

The analysis must be completed by considering the Operating Leverage (OL) and Financial Risk Level (FRL) jointly of Sections 1-4. The Operating Leverage relates to the relationship between operating revenues and contribution margin, while the Financial Risk Level relates to the relationship between the EBIT and Net Income due to the weight of financial cost of debt.

### Section 1

An analysis of the relationships between Operating Revenues, Capital Invested and Structure, and Free Cash-flows from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity, it can be achieved on the basis of several main ratios:

(a) Capex on Operating Revenues (COR);
(b) Financial Debt on Operating Revenues (FDOR);
(c) Cash-flow on Operating Revenues (CFOR);

Before starting the analysis it is important to point out that Operating Revenues are used rather than Revenues because they refer to the core-business of the company strictly. However, also if there are other Revenues (such as non-operating revenues, non-current operating revenues, and financial revenues) the Operating Revenues represent the greatest and most relevant part of Total Revenues.

(a) Capex on Operating Revenues (COR):

$$
COR = \frac{\text{Capex}}{\text{Operating Revenues (OR)}} \tag{2.1}
$$

The COR ratio measures the return of capital invested in Capex on the basis of Operating Revenues. Specifically a low value of ratio means a high return of capital invested in Capex in terms of Operating Revenues. In this case, the investments in Capex are able to push-up the Operating Revenues. On the contrary, a high value of ratio means a low return of capital invested in Capex in terms of Operating Revenues. In this case, the investments in Capex are not able to push-up the Operating Revenues.

(b) Financial Debt on Operating Revenues (FDOR):

$$
FDOR = \frac{\text{Financial Debt (FD)}}{\text{Operating Revenues (OR)}} \leftrightarrow NFDOR = \frac{\text{Net Financial Position (NFP)}}{\text{Operating Revenues (OR)}} \tag{2.2}
$$

The FDOR and NFDOR ratios measure the capability of the Operating Revenues to face Financial Debt and Net Financial Position in Capital Structure. In both cases the meaning is the same. Specifically a high value of ratio means a low level of ability of Operating Revenues to face Financial Debt (FD) and Net Financial Position (NFP). On the contrary, a low value of ratio means a high capability of Operating Revenues to face Financial Debt (FD) and Net Financial Position (NFP).

(c) Cash-flow on Operating Revenues (CFOR):

$$
CFOR = \frac{\text{Cash-flow (CF)}}{\text{Operating Revenues (OR)}} \tag{2.3}
$$

The CFOR ratio measures the relationship between Cash-flow and Operating Revenues. It can be considered as an indirect and approximate measure of the company's ability to transform Operating Revenues into Cash-flows. Specifically a low value of ratio means a bad relationship between Operating Revenues and Cash-flows. On the contrary, a high value of ratio means a good relationship between Operating Revenues and Cash-flows.

Considering two types of cash-flows, Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO) and the Free Cash-flow to Equity, the ratio can be applied in two versions:

$$
CFOR = \frac{CF}{OR} \rightarrow \begin{array}{l}CFOOR = \frac{\text{Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO)}}{\text{Operating Revenues (OR)}}\\CFEOR = \frac{\text{Free Cash-flow to Equity (FCFE)}}{\text{Operating Revenues (OR)}}\end{array}\tag{2.4}
$$

### Section 2

The analysis of the relationships between Operating Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, and Free Cash-flows from Operations and Free Cash-flows to Equity can focus on the following main ratios:

(a) Return on Operating Capital Invested (ROIC);
(b) Financial Debt on Operating Income (FDOI);
(c) Cost of Financial Debt on Cash-flows (CDCF);
(d) Cash-flows on Operating Income (CFOI).

(a) Return on Operating Capital Invested (ROIC):

$$
ROIC = \frac{\text{Operating Income (OI)}}{\text{Capital Invested in Operating Assets (CI)}} \tag{2.5}
$$

The ROIC ratio defines the relationship between Operating Income (OI) and Capital Invested in Operating Assets (CI) only. It is also called Return on Investment (ROI) if all company's investments are in core-business.

The ratio measures the return of capital invested in operating assets of the company. Specifically a high value of ratio means a high return of capital invested; on the contrary, a low value of ratio means a low return of capital invested.

The Capital Invested in Operating Assets is the capital sources invested to support the company's core-business activities. Therefore, investments in non-operating activities are not included. By following the analytical scheme proposed in the previous Chapter, the Capital Invested in Operating Assets is the Net Operating Capital Invested (NOCI). It is equal to the total of investments in Net Operating Capital Expenditures (Capex) and Net Working Capital (NWC).

The Operating Income is the difference between Operating Revenues and Operating Costs. Therefore, it measures the results of the Operating activities. It can be measured by three main figures: EBITDA, EBIT and NOPAT. Therefore, the ratio can be applied in three versions:

$$
ROIC = \frac{EBITDA}{\text{Net Operating Capital Invested (NOCI)}}
$$

$$
ROIC = \frac{OI}{CI} \rightarrow ROIC = \frac{EBIT}{\text{Net Operating Capital Invested (NOCI)}} \tag{2.6}
$$

$$
ROIC = \frac{NOPAT}{\text{Net Operating Capital Invested (NOCI)}}
$$

It is important to point out that if Capex is only considered as Capital Invested rather than the NOCI, it gets the Return on Assets (ROA) as follows:

$$
ROA = \frac{EBITDA}{Capex}
$$

$$
ROA = \frac{OI}{Capex} \rightarrow ROA = \frac{\frac{EBIT}{Capex}}{NOPAT} \tag{2.7}
$$

$$
ROA = \frac{NOPAT}{Capex}
$$

In order to acquire more information, it is also possible to measure the Return on Capital Invested in terms of Gross Profit (GP). In this case it takes on the following ratio (ROGP):

$$
ROGP = \frac{\text{Gross Profit (GP)}}{\text{Net Operating Capital Invested (NOCI)}} \tag{2.8}
$$

It is worth noting that in all cases, the increase of ratio is not necessarily good news. With equal Operating Income, the increase of the ratio is due to the reduction of total assets. If the reduction is due to the amortization and depreciation process, the increase of ratio is due to a reduction in investments. Most of all, the decrease of investments in Capex implies the reduction of future capabilities of the company to compete in the business and, subsequently a future reduction in Operating Income.

Otherwise, the increase of ratio due to the development of technologies, indicates an increase of the future capabilities of the company to compete in the business and, subsequently a future increase in the Operating Income.

Usually EBIT is preferred to EBITDA and NOPAT to measure Operating Income.

Using EBIT, the ratio can be decomposed on the basis of the Return on Sales (ROS) and the Turnover of Capital Invested (TCI).

Considering that the ROS is equal to the ratio between EBIT and Sales Revenues (SR), and the TCI is equal to the ratio between Sales Revenues (SR) and Net Operating Capital Invested (NOCI), the following is achieved:

$$
ROI = ROS \cdot TCI \rightarrow \begin{array}{l}ROS = \frac{EBIT}{SR}\\TCI = \frac{SR}{NOCI}\end{array} \rightarrow ROI = \frac{EBIT}{SR} \cdot \frac{SR}{NOCI} = \frac{EBIT}{NOCI} \tag{2.9}
$$

The use of EBITDA highlights the effects of the amortization and depreciation process on the Operating Income. However, it is possible to move from the EBITDA to the EBIT by considering the Net Operating Capital Invested Gross of Amortization and Depreciation (NOCIG) as following (Silvi 2012):

$$
ROIC = \frac{EBITDA}{NOCIG} \cdot \frac{NOCIG}{NOCI} \cdot \frac{EBIT}{EBITDA} = \frac{EBIT}{NOCI} \tag{2.10}
$$

The use of NOPAT can only be calculated if taxes splitting is not used. Indeed, the use of tax splitting allows for a distinction between operating taxes and corporate taxes. In this case, the EBIT is calculated by also considering operating taxes. Therefore it is equal to NOPAT.

Differently, if tax splitting is not used in the tax area operating taxes and corporate taxes are considered jointly. In this case EBIT is the operating income before taxes while the NOPAT is the operating income after taxes.

Using NOPAT, the ROIC ratio measures the after-taxes operating profit divided by capital invested in core-business of the company (Koller et al. 2015).

(b) Financial Debt on Operating Income (FDOI):

$$
FDOI = \frac{\text{Financial Debt (FD)}}{\text{Operating Income (OI)}} \tag{2.11}
$$

The FDOI ratio measures the company's ability to face Financial Debt (FD) through the Operating Income (OI). Generally, the greater the distance between the amount of Operating Income and the amount of Financial Debt, the lower the financial risk.

Considering that the Operating Income can be measured by EBITDA, EBIT and NOPAT it is also important to consider that the Net Financial Position (NFP) can be used instead of Financial Debt (FD).

Therefore, the ratio can be applied in several versions as follows:

$$
FDOI = \frac{\text{Financial Debt (FD)}}{EBITDA} \leftrightarrow NFDOI = \frac{\text{Net Financial Position (NFP)}}{EBITDA}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} FDOI = \frac{FD}{OI} \rightarrow FDOI = \frac{\text{Financial Debt (FD)}}{EBIT} \leftrightarrow NFDOI = \frac{\text{Net Financial Position (NFP)}}{EBIT} \\ FDOI = \frac{\text{Financial Debt (FD)}}{NOPAT} \leftrightarrow NFDOI = \frac{\text{Net Financial Position (NFP)}}{NOPAT} \tag{2.12} \\ \end{array}
$$

In order to acquire more information, the Gross Profit (GP) ability to face Financial Debt (FD) or Net Financial Position (NFP) can be measured. In this case, the FDGP ratio is the following:

$$
FDGP = \frac{\text{Financial Debt (FD)}}{\text{Gross Profit (GP)}} \leftrightarrow NFDOI = \frac{\text{Net Financial Position (NFP)}}{\text{Gross Profit (GP)}} \tag{2.13}
$$

(c) Cost of Financial Debt on Cash-flows (CDCF):

$$
CDCF = \frac{\text{Cost of Financial Debt (CD)}}{\text{Cashflows (CF)}} \tag{2.14}
$$

Despite the fact that the cost of financial debt has both economic (it is a cost) and financial dynamics (it is a cash-out), in this context an analysis of its impact on financial dynamics is preferred. Indeed, the effects of cost of debt on cash-flows is very relevant because if the company cannot face the relative cash-out, it is in a default condition.

The Cost of Financial Debt (CD) is equal to the Interest on Debt (ID) plus the other Financial Costs on Debt (FCD). Therefore:

$$
PM = Er / R \tag{2.31}
$$

The most relevant part is related to the Interest on Debt. Also, by considering that the cash-flows can be distinguished between Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO) and Free Cash-flow to Equity (FCFE), it is possible to apply the ratio in several versions as follows:

$$
CDCF = \frac{CD}{CF} \rightarrow \begin{array}{l}CDCF O = \frac{CD}{FCFO} \leftrightarrow IDCF O = \frac{ID}{FCFO}\\CDCF E = \frac{CD}{FCFE} \leftrightarrow IDCF E = \frac{ID}{FCFE}\end{array}\tag{2.16}
$$

(d) Cash-flows on Operating Income (CFOI):

$$
CFOI = \frac{\text{Cashflows (CF)}}{\text{Operating Income (OI)}} \tag{2.17}
$$

The CFOI ratio measures the relationship between Operating Income and Cash-flows. It can be considered as an indirect and approximate measure of the company's ability to transform Operating Income in Cash-flows. Specifically, a high value of ratio means a good relationship between Operating Income and Cash-flows; otherwise, a low value of ratio means a bad relationship between Operating Income and Cash-flows.

Considering the two types of cash-flows, Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO) and the Free Cash-flow to Equity, the ratio can be applied in two versions:

$$
\begin{array}{l} CFOI = \frac{CF}{OI} \rightarrow \begin{array}{l}CFOOI = \frac{\text{Free Cashflow from Operations (FCFO)}}{\text{Operating Income (OI)}}\\\text{Free Cashflow to Equivalency (ECFE)}\end{array}\tag{2.18} \\ CFE OI = \frac{\text{Free Cashflow to Equity (FCFE)}}{\text{Operating Income (OI)}} \\ \end{array}
$$

### Section 3

An analysis of the relationships between Net Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure, and Free Cash-flows from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity can be focus on the following main ratios:

(a) Return on Equity (ROE);
(b) Financial Debt on Net Income (FDNI);
(c) Net Income on Capital Invested (NICI);
(d) Cash-flows on Net Income (CFNI).
(a) Return on Equity (ROE):

$$
R O E = \frac {\text {N e t I n c o m e} (N I)}{\text {E q u i t y} (E)} \tag {2.19}
$$

The ROE ratio is one of the most popular and most commonly used. It measures the return on Capital Invested in equity on the basis of Net Income.

In the financial approach the return of shareholders' investment is the aim of the company and thus the ROE is the true bottom-line measure of company performance.

The ROE can be defined on the basis of ROI and the Financial Leverage (L). Assuming that there are no non-operating activities, the ROI measures the return on Capital Invested in Operating Assets  $(ROI \equiv ROIC)$ . Also, the Net Income (NI) is equal to the EBIT less Interest on debt (ID) and Taxes (T):

$$
Er = TRS - DY \tag{2.32}
$$

Considering that EBT is equal to EBIT less Interest in debt (ID), we can assume the calculation of Taxes (T) on the basis of a marginal tax rate  $(t_c)$  on EBT. Therefore:

$$
EBT = EBIT - ID
$$

$$
T = EBT \cdot t_{c} \rightarrow T = (EBIT - ID) \cdot t_{c}
$$

$$
NI = EBIT - ID - [(EBIT - ID) \cdot t_{c}] = (EBIT - ID) \cdot (1 - t_{c})
$$

$$
NI = (EBIT - ID) \cdot (1 - t_{c}) \tag{2.21}
$$

Considering that:

$$
ROE = \frac{NI}{E} \rightarrow NI = ROE \cdot E
$$

$$
ROI = \frac{EBIT}{CI} \rightarrow EBIT = ROI \cdot CI
$$

and by considering that the interest on debt (ID) is equal to the Cost of Debt  $(K_{D})$  multiplied by the amount of debt (D) in capital structure:

$$
ID = D \cdot K_{D}
$$

By replacing it, Eq. (2.21) can be re-written as follows:

$$
ROE \cdot E = (ROI \cdot CI - D \cdot K_{D}) \cdot (1 - t_{c}) \tag{2.22}
$$

We can assume that the entire capital, equal to Equity (E) plus Debt (D), is invested in operating assets only. In this case, the Capital Invested (CI) is equal to the Capital Structure (CS) that it is equal to the sum of Equity (E) and Debt (D):

$$
CI = CS \rightarrow CI = E + D
$$

By replacing it, Eq. (2.22) can be re-written as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} ROE \cdot E = [ROI \cdot (E + D) - D \cdot K_{D}] \cdot (1 - t_{c}) \\ = [ROI \cdot E + D \cdot (ROI - K_{D})] \cdot (1 - t_{c}) \\ \end{array}
$$

Dividing first and second terms by Equity (E), we achieve:

$$
ROE \cdot E \cdot \frac{1}{E} = [ROI \cdot E + D \cdot (ROI - K_{D})] \cdot (1 - t_{c}) \cdot \frac{1}{E}
$$

$$
ROE = \left[ ROI \cdot \frac{E}{E} + \frac{D}{E} \cdot (ROI - K_{D}) \right] \cdot (1 - t_{c})
$$

$$
ROE = \left[ ROI + \frac{D}{E} \cdot (ROI - K_{D}) \right] \cdot (1 - t_{c})
$$

The ratio between Debt (D) and Equity (E) defines the Leverage (L):

$$
L = \frac{D}{E} \tag{2.23}
$$

And subsequently:

$$
ROE = [ROI + L \cdot (ROI - K_{D})] \cdot (1 - t_{c}) \tag{2.24}
$$

Equation (2.24) shows the relationship between ROE, ROI and Leverage (L). Specifically, it shows the multiple effects of debt on ROE. This effect can be positive or negative. It depends on the relationship between the ROI and the Cost of Debt  $(K_{D})$  on the one hand, and the amount of Debt (D) in the Capital Structure on the other hand.

Specifically, the Financial Leverage (FL) can be defined as follows:

$$
FL = L \cdot (ROI - K_{D}) \tag{2.25}
$$

Therefore if:

-  $ROI > K_{D}$ : the Financial Leverage (FL) is positive. The Debt invested in the company generates a return on investment (ROI) greater than its costs ( $K_{D}$ ); therefore, the increase in ROE is due to the ROI in an unlevered case plus the positive Leverage (L) effects. Consequently, other conditions equal, greater is the Leverage (L) and higher is the ROE. In this case, the Leverage (L) is a positive multiplier. The shareholders achieve earnings created from Debt. They benefit from the positive difference between ROI and  $K_{D}$ ;
-  $ROI < K_{D}$ : the Financial Leverage (FL) is negative. The Debt invested in the company generates a return on investment (ROI) lower than its costs ( $K_{D}$ ); therefore, the decrease in ROE is due to the ROI in unlevered case plus the negative Leverage (L) effects. Consequently, other conditions equal, greater is the Leverage (L) and lower is the ROE. In this case, the Leverage (L) is a negative multiplier. The shareholders claim losses arising from debt. Their loss is due to the negative difference between ROI and  $K_{D}$ .

Note that the ROE is an account measure. Usually, investors prefer the Total Return on Shareholders (TRS). It also takes into account market variations in stock price. Indeed, it combines the amount that shareholders gain through any increase in the share price over a given period with the sum of dividends paid to them over the period. Specifically, TRS is equal to the Percentage Change in Share Price ( $\Delta \mathrm{SP}$ ) plus the Dividend Yield ( $DY$ ) as follows:

$$
TRS = \Delta SP + DY \tag{2.26}
$$

The Dividend Yield (DY) measures the annual dividend per share paid by the company to its shareholders expressed as a percentage of its share price. Therefore, the Dividend Yield is equal to Dividend per Share (DPS) divided by Share Price (SP), as follows:

$$
DY = \frac{DPS}{SP} \tag{2.27}
$$

Note that Dividends are paid typically on a quarterly basis. Therefore, they must be annualized to calculate the Implied Dividend Yield (IDY) as follows:

$$
IDY = \frac{\text{Most Recent Quarterly DPS} \times 4}{\text{Current SP}}
$$

The TRS can be broken down (Koller et al. 2015). The analysis of the TRS's components can be useful for greater understanding of managers' activities and for greater planning of future targets.

The Percentage Change in Share Price ( $\Delta \mathrm{SP}$ ) can be expressed in terms of Percent Increase in Earnings ( $\Delta \mathrm{Er}$ ) and the Percentage Change in a Company's Price-to-Earnings Ratio ( $\Delta (\mathrm{P} / \mathrm{Er})$ ) as follows:

$$
\Delta SP = \Delta Er + \Delta \left(\frac{P}{Er}\right) \tag{2.28}
$$

where:

- the first term  $(\Delta Er)$  is the Percentage Change in Share Price due to the change in the company's fundamentals as measured by the change in earnings;
- the second term  $\Delta(P / Er)$  is the Percentage Change in Share Price due to the change in the company's fundamentals combined with the change in price due to the investors' expectations on company earnings.

On the basis of Eq. (2.28), Eq. (2.26) can be re-written as follows:

$$
TRS = \Delta Er + \Delta \left(\frac{P}{Er}\right) + DY \tag{2.29}
$$

Technically, there is an additional cross-term that reflects the interaction of the share price change and the  $P / Er$  change, but it is generally small and therefore it can be ignored in this context.

There are three main problems of this traditional approach (Koller et al. 2015):

- first, the manager might assume that all forms of earnings can create an equal amount of value. But different sources of growth in earnings may create different amounts of value because they are associated with different returns on capital by generating different cash flows;
- second, it suggests that the dividend yield can be increased without affecting future earnings. But dividends are merely residual and they themselves are not able to create value;
- third, the impact of leverage is not considered.

However, it is possible to break down the TRS by overcoming these limits (Koller et al. 2015). Assuming that the company is financed only by equity (E). Also, assuming that the entire wealth generated is distributed in form of dividends.

The Percentage Increase in Earning  $(\Delta Er)$  can be broken down into Percent Increase in Revenues  $(\Delta R)$  and in the Percent Change in Profit Margin  $(\Delta PM)$ , as follows:

$$
\Delta Er = \Delta R + \Delta PM \tag{2.33}
$$

Note that the Profit Margin is equal to the Earnings divided by Revenues  $(PM = Er / R)$ . Therefore, it measures the weight of costs indirectly.

Technically there is an additional cross-term that reflects the interaction of these two effects, but it is small and then it can be omitted in this context allowing to focus on the key point.

The Dividend Yield  $(DY)$  is equal to the Dividend amount  $(Div)$  divided by the Share Price  $(SP)$  as defined in Eq. (2.27).

In order to simplify the analysis without any loss of significance, it is possible to assume that all revenues immediately generate cash-in and all costs immediately generate cash-out. It implies that there is no Net Working Capital (NWC). It also assumes that there are no other cash movements other than investments. Under these assumptions, it is possible to define Dividend per Share  $(DPS)$  on the basis of Earning  $(Er)$ , growth rate  $(g_{n})$  and ROIC as follows:

$$
DPS = Er \cdot \left(1 - \frac{g_n}{ROIC}\right) \tag{2.31}
$$

The Share Price (SP) can be defined on the basis of Earnings  $(Er)$  and the Price-Earning ratio as follows:

$$
SP = Er \cdot \left(\frac{P}{Er}\right) \tag{2.32}
$$

On the basis of Eqs. (2.31) and (2.32), Eq. (2.27) can be re-written as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} DY = \frac{DPS}{SP} = \frac{Er \cdot \left(1 - \frac{g_n}{ROIC}\right)}{Er \cdot \left(\frac{P}{Er}\right)} = \frac{1 - \frac{g_n}{ROIC}}{\frac{P}{Er}} = \left(1 - \frac{g_n}{ROIC}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{Er}{P}\right) \\ = \left(\frac{Er}{P}\right) - \left(\frac{g_n}{ROIC} \cdot \frac{Er}{P}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

and then:

$$
DY = \left(\frac{Er}{P}\right) - \left(\frac{g_n}{ROIC} \cdot \frac{Er}{P}\right) \tag{2.33}
$$

where:

- the first term  $\left( \frac{Er}{P} \right)$  is the inverse of the Price-to-Earnings ratio and it is usually called the Earnings Yield (  $EY$  ) or Zero Growth Return. It represents the return an investor would earn if the company did not grow or improve its profit margin and if it paid out all its earnings in dividends. Its share price would remain constant;
- the second term  $\left(\frac{g_n}{ROIC} \cdot \frac{Er}{P}\right)$  represents the part of its earnings yield that the company must reinvest each year to achieve its growth at its level of ROIC.

On the basis of Eq. (2.30) it refers to the Percentage Increase in Earning  $(\Delta Er)$  and Eq. (2.33) refers to the Dividend Yield  $(DY)$ , Eq. (2.29) can be re-written as follows:

## 2.2 Financial Ratios Analysis

$$
TRS = \Delta R + \Delta PM + \Delta \left(\frac{P}{Er}\right) + \left(\frac{Er}{P}\right) - \left(\frac{g_n}{ROIC} \cdot \frac{Er}{P}\right)
$$

that can be rearranged as follows:

$$
TRS = \Delta R - \left(\frac{g_n}{ROIC} \cdot \frac{Er}{P}\right) + \Delta PM + \left(\frac{Er}{P}\right) + \Delta \left(\frac{P}{Er}\right) \tag{2.34}
$$

This decomposition leads to four key drivers of TRS:

-  $\Delta R - \left(\frac{g_n}{ROIC} \cdot \frac{E_r}{P}\right)$ : it is the value generated from revenue growth net of the capital required to grow at the company's projected ROIC;
-  $\Delta PM$ : it is the impact of the change in profit margin;
-  $\left(\frac{Er}{P}\right)$ : it is what TRS would have been, without any growth and profit margin improvements often called the Earning Yield or Zero Growth Return;
-  $\Delta\left(\frac{P}{Er}\right)$ : it is the changes in shareholders' expectations on company performance, measured by the change in its  $(P / Er)$  or other multiple earnings.

Equation (2.34) shows that investor's expectations have a big effect on TRS. It is relevant to note that a company whose TRS has consistently outperformed the market will reach a point in which it will no longer be able to satisfy expectations reflected in its share price. From that point onwards, TRS will be lower than it was in the past, even if the company may still be creating value.

(b) Financial Debt on Net Income (FDNI):

$$
FDNI = \frac{\text{Financial Debt (FD)}}{\text{Net Income (NI)}} \leftrightarrow FDNI = \frac{\text{Net Financial Position (NFP)}}{\text{Net Income (NI)}} \tag{2.35}
$$

The ratio FDNI can be applied by considering the Financial Debt (FD) or the Net Financial Position (NFPD). In both case, it measures the relationship between Net Income and Financial Debt. Generally the higher the ratio, the lower the company's ability to face Financial Debt.

(c) Net Income on Capital Invested (NICI):

$$
NICI = \frac{\text{Net Income (NI)}}{\text{Capital Invested (CI)}} \tag{2.36}
$$

The NICI ratio defines the relationship between Net Income (NI) and the Capital Invested (CI) in the company. Therefore, it measures the return of Capital Invested on Net Income.

It is possible to measure the return of Capital Invested in Operating Assets (NOCI) on Net Income (NI). It gets the NINOI ratio as follows:

$$
NINOCI = \frac{\text{Net Income (NI)}}{\text{Net Operating Capital Invested (NOCI)}} \tag{2.37}
$$

It is worth noting that in all cases, the increase of ratio is not necessarily good news. Net Income being equal, the increase of the ratio is due to a reduction in the capital invested. The decrease of investments implies the reduction of future company abilities to compete in the business and, therefore a future reduction in Operating and Net Income.

(d) Cash-flows on Net Income (CFNI):

$$
CFNI = \frac{\text{Cashflows (CF)}}{\text{Net Income (NI)}} \tag{2.38}
$$

The CFNI ratio measures the relationship between Net Income and Cash-flows. It can be considered as an indirect and approximate measure of the company's ability to transform Net Income in Cash-flows. Indeed a high value of ratio means a good relationship between Net Income and Cash-flows; otherwise, a low value of ratio means a bad relationship between Net Income and Cash-flows.

Considering two types of cash-flows, Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO) and the Free Cash-flow to Equity, the ratio can be applied in two versions:

$$
CFNI = \frac{CF}{NI} \rightarrow \begin{array}{l}CFNI = \frac{\text{Free Cashflow from Operations (FCFO)}}{\text{Net Income (NI)}}\\CFNI = \frac{\text{Free Cashflow to Equity (FCFE)}}{\text{Net Income (NI)}}\end{array}\tag{2.39}
$$

### Section 4

The analysis of the relationships between Capital Invested and Capital Structure, and Free Cash-flows from Operations and Free Cash-flow to Equity can be focused on the following main ratios:

(a) Equity on Cash-flows (ECF);
(b) Financial Debt on Cash-flows (FDCF);
(c) Capex on Cash-flows (CCF).

(a) Equity on Cash-flows (ECF):

$$
ECF = \frac{\text{Equity (E)}}{\text{Cashflows (CF)}} \tag{2.40}
$$

The ratio ECF defines the relationship between Equity (E) and the Cash-flows (CF). Considering two types of cash-flows, Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO) and the Free Cash-flow to Equity (FCFE), the ratio can be applied in two versions:

$$
ECF = \frac{E}{CF} \rightarrow \begin{array}{l}ECF = \frac{\text{Equity (E)}}{\text{Free Cashflow from Operations (FCFO)}}\\ECF = \frac{\text{Equity (E)}}{\text{Free Cashflow to Equity (FCFE)}}\end{array}\tag{2.41}
$$

(b) Financial Debt on Cash-flows (FDCF):

$$
FDCF = \frac{\text{Financial Debt (FD)}}{\text{Cashflows (CF)}} \tag{2.42}
$$

The ratio ECF defines the relationship between Financial Debt (FD) and the Cash-flows (CF). Considering that it is possible to use the Net Financial Position (NFP) instead of Financial Debt (FD), and by considering that there are two types of cash-flows, Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO) and the Free Cash-flow to Equity, the ratio can be applied in two versions:

$$
FDCF = \frac{\text{Financial Debt (FD)}}{\text{Free Cashflow from Operations (FCFO)}}
$$

$$
FDCF = \frac{FD}{CF} \rightarrow \begin{array}{l}FDCF = \frac{\text{Net Financial Position (NFP)}}{\text{Free Cashflow from Operations (FCFO)}}\\FDCF = \frac{\text{Financial Debt (FD)}}{\text{Free Cashflow to Equity (FCFE)}}\end{array}\tag{2.43}
$$

$$
FDCF = \frac{\text{Net Financial Position (NFP)}}{\text{Free Cashflow to Equity (FCFE)}}
$$

(c) Capex on Cash-flows (CCF):

$$
CCF = \frac{\text{Capex (C)}}{\text{Cashflows (CF)}} \tag{2.44}
$$

The ratio CCF defines the relationship between Capex (C) and the Cash-flows (CF). Considering two types of cash-flows, Free Cash-flow from Operations (FCFO) and the Free Cash-flow to Equity (FCFE), the ratio can be applied in two versions:

$$
CCF = \frac{C}{CF} \rightarrow \begin{array}{l}CCF = \frac{\text{Capex (c)}}{\text{Free Cashflow from Operations (FCFO)}}\\ECF = \frac{\text{Capex (c)}}{\text{Free Cashflow to Equity (FCFE)}}\end{array}\tag{2.45}
$$

### Operating Leverage and Financial Risk Level

The analysis of Sects. 2.1-2.4 must be completed by considering the Operating Leverage and Financial Risk Level (Anthony et al. 2011; Garrison et al. 2015).

The Operating Leverage (OL) of the company refers to the relationship between Operating Revenues and Contribution Margin (the complete analysis is in Chap. 3). Specifically, it measures the reaction of the EBIT to the variation in the Volume of goods sold.

Specifically, it is function of the costs structure: the greater the rigidity of the costs structure, the greater the negative effects on the EBIT of the negative variations of the Operating Revenues.

The Operating Leverage (OL) can be measured on the basis of EBIT and Volume of goods sold (V) in a lead-time  $t_0$ ;  $t_1$  as follows:

$$
OL = \frac{\Delta (\%) EBIT}{\Delta (\%) V} = \frac{\frac{EBIT_{1} - EBIT_{0}}{EBIT_{0}}}{\frac{V_{1} - V_{0}}{V_{0}}} = \frac{EBIT_{1} - EBIT_{0}}{EBIT_{0}} \cdot \frac{V_{0}}{V_{1} - V_{0}} \tag{2.46}
$$

The EBIT can be defined on the basis of Revenue per Unit  $(R_U)$ , Variable Costs per Unit  $(VC_U)$ , Total Fixed Costs  $(FC_T)$  and Volume of sales  $(V)$  as follows:

$$
EBIT = (R_{U} - VC_{U}) \cdot V - FC_{T} \tag{2.47}
$$

Note that the difference between Revenues  $(R)$  and Variable Cost  $(VC)$  defines the Contribution Margin  $(CM)$ . Therefore, the difference between Revenue per Unit  $(R_U)$  and Variable Costs per Unit  $(VC_U)$  defines the Contribution Margin per Unit  $(CM_U)$ :

$$
CM = (R - VC) \leftrightarrow CM_{U} = (R_{U} - VC_{U}) \rightarrow CM = CM_{U} \cdot V = (R_{U} - VC_{U}) \cdot V
$$

On the basis of Eq. (2.47), Eq. (2.46) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} O L = \frac {\left[ \left(R _ {U} - V C _ {U}\right) \cdot V _ {1} - F C _ {T} \right] - \left[ \left(R _ {U} - V C _ {U}\right) \cdot V _ {0} - F C _ {T} \right]}{\left(R _ {U} - V C _ {U}\right) \cdot V _ {0} - F C _ {T}} \cdot \frac {V _ {0}}{V _ {1} - V _ {0}} \\ = \frac {\left(R _ {U} - V C _ {U}\right) \cdot V _ {1} + \left(R _ {U} - V C _ {U}\right) \cdot V _ {0}}{\left(R _ {U} - V C _ {U}\right) \cdot V _ {0} - F C _ {T}} \cdot \frac {V _ {0}}{V _ {1} - V _ {0}} = \frac {\left(R _ {U} - V C _ {U}\right) \cdot \left(V _ {1} - V _ {0}\right)}{\left(R _ {U} - V C _ {U}\right) \cdot V _ {0} - F C _ {T}} \cdot \frac {V _ {0}}{V _ {1} - V _ {0}} \\ = \frac {\left(R _ {U} - V C _ {U}\right) \cdot V _ {0}}{\left(R _ {U} - V C _ {U}\right) \cdot V _ {0} - F C _ {T}} \\ \end{array}
$$

and by considering that:

$$
C M = \left(R _ {U} - V C _ {U}\right) \cdot V _ {0}
$$

$$
E B I T = \left(R _ {U} - V C _ {U}\right) \cdot V - F C _ {T}
$$

The result is:

$$
OL = \frac{CM}{EBIT} \tag{2.48}
$$

Note that by expressing Eq. (2.46) for EBIT, it gets:

$$
\Delta (\%) EBIT = OL \cdot \Delta (\%) V \tag{2.49}
$$

Equation (2.49) shows that the higher the Operating Leverage  $(OL)$ , the higher the variability of the EBIT to the variations in the Volume of goods sold  $(V)$ .

This Operating Leverage  $(OL)$  is due to two main elements:

- the variation of the Volume of goods sold  $(V)$ ;
- the cost structure rigidity to be measured on the basis of relationship between fixed and variable costs.

Considering these two effects, subsequently:

- the higher fixed costs are than variable costs, the greater the rigidity of the costs structure. In this case, variations in the Volumes of goods sold generate reductions rather than proportional of the EBIT and, all other variables being equal, of the Net Income;
- the higher the variable costs over fixed costs, the greater the flexibility of the costs structure. In this case, variations in the volume of goods sold generate reductions less than proportional of the EBIT and, all other variables being equal, of the Net Income.

Two are the constraints to be kept in mind:

- first, this analysis is relevant in a specific time range (in terms of time or productivity capacity) only. Beyond this range, all costs are variable;
- second, this analysis assumes that the price per unit, the cost variable per unit and fixed costs are fixed in the time considered. Therefore, the volume of goods sold is the only variable that can be changed.

The Financial Risk level (FRL) of the company refers to the relationship between the EBIT and Net Income due to the weight of financial cost of debt.

Specifically, it measures the financial risk based on the relationship between EBIT and interest on debt. The financial risk is function of the company's ability to cover the interest on debt, due to the amount of debt in the capital structure, by the operating income: the greater the amount and the risk of debt in the capital structure, the higher the interest on debt and the lower is the company ability to cover it.

Assuming that the difference between EBIT and EBT is due to the interest on debt only, the financial risk can be measured by the ratio between EBIT and EBIT less Interest on Debt on the basis of a lead-time  $t_0$ ;  $t_1$  as follows:

$$
FRL = \frac{\Delta (\%) EBT}{\Delta (\%) EBIT} = \frac{\frac{EBT_{1} - EBT_{0}}{EBT_{0}}}{\frac{EBIT_{1} - EBIT_{0}}{EBIT_{0}}} = \frac{EBT_{1} - EBT_{0}}{EBT_{0}} \cdot \frac{EBIT_{0}}{EBIT_{1} - EBIT_{0}} \tag{2.50}
$$

By considering that:

$$
EBT = EBIT - I
$$

and by changing, it gets:

$$
\begin{array}{l} F R L = \frac {\left(E B I T _ {1} - I\right) - \left(E B I T _ {0} - I\right)}{E B I T _ {0} - I} \cdot \frac {E B I T _ {0}}{E B I T _ {1} - E B I T _ {0}} \\ = \frac {E B I T _ {1} - E B I T _ {0}}{E B I T _ {0} - I} \cdot \frac {E B I T _ {0}}{E B I T _ {1} - E B I T _ {0}} = \frac {E B I T _ {1} - E B I T _ {0}}{E B I T _ {0} - I} \cdot \frac {E B I T _ {0}}{E B I T _ {1} - E B I T _ {0}} \\ \end{array}
$$

and then:

$$
F R L = \frac {E B I T}{E B I T - I} \tag {2.51}
$$

Note that by assuming that there are no non-operating revenues and costs or financial revenues (so that EBIT less Interest on Debt is equal to EBT) and by assuming equal taxation so that variations in EBT generate equal variations in Net Income  $(NI)$ , it gets:

$$
E B I T - I = E B T = N I
$$

On the basis of these assumptions, Eq. (2.51) can be re-written as follows:

$$
F R L = \frac {E B I T}{N I} \tag {2.52}
$$

Note that by expressing Eq. (2.50) on the basis of EBIT, it gets:

$$
\Delta (\%) E B T = F R L \cdot \Delta (\%) E B I T \tag{2.53}
$$

And on the basis of assumptions related Eq. (2.52), it gets:

$$
\Delta (\%)NI = FRL \cdot \Delta (\%)EBIT \tag{2.54}
$$

The FRL measures the effects of interest on debt on Net Income dynamic: the higher the FRL, the greater the amount of interest on debt due to leverage, the lower is the ability of EBIT to cover it and the higher the probability of the company's default.

Therefore, the greater the FRL, the higher is the variability of the Net Income to the variances of the Volume of goods sold.

## 2.3 Growth Rate Analysis

The fundamental analysis of the firm leads to investigate into the expected consistency of the future economic and financial dynamics. Consequently, one of the most relevant keys to the analysis is an estimate of the company's future growth rate with regards to mainly both Net Income and Operating Income. Two are the mean approaches used to estimate the company's expected growth rate:

- the first is based on an analysis of the company's fundamentals;
- the second is based on an analysis of the historical trends.

An estimate of the growth rate based on an analysis of the company's fundamentals may be more specific, rigorous and reliable than the analysis based on historical trends. Unfortunately, analysts do not normally access the company's internal information. Therefore, they often use the analysis of the historical trends and integrate them with information that they can acquire about companies that they follow.

In this context, only the first approach is considered. Therefore, the growth rate estimate of both Operating and Net Income is based on the company's fundamentals (Damodaran 2012; Koller et al. 2015).

The estimate of the company's growth rate based on the analysis of the historical trends requires specific knowledge of advanced statistical models. For their analysis refer to the reference literature.

#### 2.3.1 Growth Rate in Net Income

The expected Growth Rate in Net Income  $(g_{NI})$  is linked to the equity reinvested in the company and to the return on equity (Damodaran 2012).

An estimate of the expected growth rate in Net Income  $(g_{NI})$ , can be created based on:

- Retention Ratio (RR), measuring the percentage of earnings retained by the company;
- Return on Equity (ROE), measuring measures the return on investment in equity.

Generally, the relationship between Retention Ratio  $(RR)$ , Return on Equity  $(ROE)$  and expected Growth Rate in Net Income  $(g_{NI})$ , is characterized by a direct proportion: if the company has a high Retention Ratio and a high Return on Equity, it will have a high Growth Rate in Net Income.

Considering Net Income in time  $t(NI_{t})$  and in previous time  $(NI_{t - 1})$ , the Growth Rate in  $t$ -time  $(g_{NI_t})$  can be measured in simple way as follows:

$$
g_{NI_{t}} = \frac{NI_{t} - NI_{t-1}}{NI_{t-1}} = \frac{NI_{t}}{NI_{t-1}} - 1 \tag{2.55}
$$

It is worth noting that in order to measure the Growth Rate  $(g_{NI_t})$  with regards to a specific period time, it is possible to use the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth

Rate). Denote with:  $N I_{t_n}$  is the ending value of Net Income and then its value at the end of the period considered;  $N I_{t_0}$  is the beginning value of Net Income and then its value at the start of the period considered;  $n$  is the number of years of the period considered. The CAGR is equal to:

$$
g_{NI_{t}} = \left(\frac{NI_{t_{n}}}{NI_{t_{0}}}\right)^{\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)} - 1 \tag{2.56}
$$

Note that CAGR is a much more accurate measure of true growth than past earnings when year-to-year growth has been erratic.

However both equations are characterized by problems. Equation (2.55) considers percentage changes in earnings in each period but it ignores compounding effects in net income; on the other hand, Eq. (2.56) considers the compounding effects by considering the first (beginning value) and last (ending value) observations but it ignores what goes on between the start and the end of the period considered. Both approaches contain problems if the Net Income is negative. In both cases the equations are not meaningful.

Considering that the ROE in the  $t$ -time is equal to the ratio between Net Income in the  $t$ -time  $(NI_{t})$  and the book value of Equity in the previous time  $(E_{t-1})$  and by solving for Net Income, we have:

$$
ROE_{t} = \frac{NI_{t}}{E_{t-1}} \rightarrow NI_{t} = E_{t-1} \cdot ROE_{t} \rightarrow \begin{array}{l}NI_{t-1} = E_{t-2} \cdot ROE_{t-1}\\NI_{t-2} = E_{t-3} \cdot ROE_{t-2}\\NI_{t-3} = E_{t-t+1} \cdot ROE_{t-t}\end{array}
$$

Assuming that the company does not issue new shares and it retains part of the Net Income on the basis of Retained Earnings  $(RE)$ . In  $t$ -time Equity  $(E_{t})$  can be defined as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} E_{t-1} = E_{t-2} + RE_{t-1} \\ E_{t} = E_{t-1} + RE_{t} \rightarrow E_{t-2} = E_{t-3} + RE_{t-2} \\ E_{t-n} = E_{t-n+1} + RE_{t-n} \\ \end{array}
$$

By replacing  $E_{t-1}$  and  $E_{t-2}$  with their equations respectively, and by assuming that the ROE is constant over time ( $ROE \equiv ROE_{t} = ROE_{t-1} = ROE_{t-n}$ ), the equations of the Net Income in the period  $t$  and  $t-1$  can be re-written as follows:

$$
NI_{t} = E_{t-1} \cdot ROE_{t} = (E_{t-2} + RE_{t-1}) \cdot ROE_{t} = (E_{t-2} + RE_{t-1}) \cdot ROE
$$

$$
NI_{t-1} = E_{t-2} \cdot ROE_{t-1} = (E_{t-3} + RE_{t-2}) \cdot ROE_{t-1} = (E_{t-3} + RE_{t-2}) \cdot ROE
$$

The difference between the Net Income in the two periods  $t$  and  $t - 1$  is equal to:

$$
\begin{array}{l} NI_{t} - NI_{t-1} = [(E_{t-2} + RE_{t-1}) \cdot ROE] - [(E_{t-3} + RE_{t-2}) \cdot ROE] \\ = (E_{t-2} + RE_{t-1} - E_{t-3} - RE_{t-2}) \cdot ROE \\ \end{array}
$$

and by considering that  $E_{t - 2} = E_{t - 3} + RE_{t - 2}$ , we have:

$$
NI_{t} - NI_{t-1} = RE_{t-1} \cdot ROE \tag{2.57}
$$

By replacing Eq. (2.57), Eq. (2.55) can be re-written as follows:

$$
g_{NI_{t}} = \frac{NI_{t} - NI_{t-1}}{NI_{t-1}} = \frac{RE_{t-1} \cdot ROE}{NI_{t-1}} = \frac{RE_{t-1}}{NI_{t-1}} \cdot ROE \tag{2.58}
$$

The ratio between  $RE_{t-1}$  and  $NI_{t-1}$  is defined Retention Ratio on Net Income (RR). It measures the amount of equity reinvested back into the company to finance its investments in the business. By replacing this, we have:

$$
g_{NI} = RR \cdot ROE \tag{2.59}
$$

Therefore, an estimate of the growth rate on Net Income  $(g_{NI})$  can be made by estimating the expected ROE and defining the amount of the retention on Net Income.

Obviously, Eq. (2.59) can be solved by Retention Ratio  $(RR_{NI})$  as follows:

$$
RR = \frac{g NI}{ROE} \tag{2.60}
$$

It is worth noting that by assuming a constant Equity over time, the growth rate of Net Income  $(g_{NI})$  it is equal to the growth of Earnings per Share  $(g_{ES})$  as follows:

$$
g_{ES} \equiv g_{NI} = RR \cdot ROE
$$

If this assumption is removed, the growth in Net Income can be different from the growth in earnings per share. If the company issues new equity to finance new projects, and if the new investments increase the Net Income, the increase in the earnings per share is not the same because the shares are changed. In this case, the relationship between Net Income and earnings per share must be redesigned.

By removing the assumption about the constant value of ROE over time, a new component of the growth must be considered. This additional growth is function of the changes in ROE over time. This amount has to be added to the growth rate as previously computed as follows:

$$
g_{NI} = RR \cdot ROE + \frac{(ROE_{t} - ROE_{t-1})}{ROE_{t-1}} \tag{2.61}
$$

Two main extensions of Eq. (2.59) can be considered.

The first refers to the ROE. The ROE can be substituted in the equation by considering the joint effects of ROI and Leverage as follows:

$$
ROE = [ROI + L \cdot (ROI - K_{D})] \cdot (1 - t_{c})
$$

$$
g_{NI} = g_{NI} = RR \cdot ROE = RR \cdot [[ROI + L \cdot (ROI - K_{D})] \cdot (1 - t_{c})] \tag{2.62}
$$

In this case, the effects on Growth Rate of ROI and Leverage (L) can be analysed.

The second refers to the Retention Rate  $(RR)$ . It is possible to consider the Equity Reinvestment Rate (ER) rather than the Retention Rate on Net Income  $(RR)$ . Specifically, the Equity Reinvestment Rate (ER) can be defined on the basis of equity reinvested in the business in form of Capex, Net Working Capital (NWC), debt reimbursement (DR), and Net Income (NI) as follows:

$$
ER = \frac{\text{Capex + NWC + DR}}{NI} \tag{2.63}
$$

In this case, the growth rate of Net income, is equal to:

$$
g_{NI} = ER \cdot ROE = \left(\frac{\Delta Capex + \Delta NWC + DR}{NI}\right) \cdot ROE \tag{2.64}
$$

These two extensions can be considered jointly as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} g_{NI} = ER \cdot ROE \\ = \left(\frac{\Delta Capex + \Delta NWC + DR}{NI}\right) \cdot [[ROI + L \cdot (ROI - K_{D})] \cdot (1 - t_{c})] \tag{2.65} \\ \end{array}
$$

#### 2.3.2 Growth Rate in Operating Income

The expected Growth Rate in Operating Income ( $g_{OI}$ ) is connected with the reinvestments in the company's operating assets and to the Return on Capital Invested (Damodaran 2012).

An estimate of the expected growth rate in Operating Income  $(g_{OI})$  can be fulfilled based on:

- Investment Rate (IR): measuring the percentage of Operating Income reinvested in the operating assets;
- Return on Capital Invested (ROCI): measuring the return on investment in operating assets. The Investment Rate (IR) can be defined on the basis of investments in Capex and Net Working Capital (NWC), and the EBIT, as follows:

$$
IR = \frac{Capex + NWC}{EBIT}
$$

By assuming a constant ROIC over time, the expected Growth Rate in Operating Income  $(g_{OI})$  is equal to the product between the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and the Investment Rate (IR) as follows:

$$
g_{OI} = IR \cdot ROIC \tag{2.66}
$$

Equation (2.66) can be solved by Investment Rare (IR) as follows:

$$
IR = \frac{g_{OI}}{ROIC} \tag{2.67}
$$

It is worth noting that the relationship between the Growth Rate in Operating Income, Investment Rate and the ROIC can be summarized as follows:

- the higher the ROIC, the lower the Investment Rate (IR) must be to achieve the defined level of Growth Rate  $(g_{OI})$ ;
- the lower the ROIC, the higher the Investment Rate (IR) must be to achieve the defined level of Growth Rate  $(g_{OI})$ .

By removing the assumption of constant ROIC over time, a new component of the growth must be considered. This additional growth is function of the changes in ROIC over time. This amount has to be added to the growth rate as previously computed as follows:

$$
g_{OI} = IR \cdot ROIC + \left(\frac{ROI_{t} - ROI_{t-1}}{ROI_{t}}\right) \tag{2.68}
$$

Therefore, the Growth Rate will be increased if the additional part is positive, and will be decreased if the additional part is negative.

In this context it is important to focus the analysis on the relationship between ROIC and the Growth Rate in Operating Income  $(\mathrm{g_{OI}})$  (Koller et al. 2015).

The starting point is the baseline value equation: a company only creates value if the ROIC is greater than the cost of capital invested.

Therefore, based on the baseline equation, company growth increases its value only if the difference between the ROIC and the cost of capital is positive; otherwise, the growth of the company destroys its value.

This relationship can be clearly understood by considering Dividends  $(Div)$ . In order to simplify the analysis without loss of significance, it is possible to assume that Earnings  $(Er)$  can be used as dividends less a part reinvested in the operating assets of the firm as follows:

$$
Div = Er \cdot (1 - IR)
$$

On the basis of Eq. (2.67), we have:

$$
IR = \frac {g_{OI}}{ROIC}
$$

and by substituting it, we have:

$$
Div = Er \cdot \left(1 - \frac{g_{OI}}{ROIC}\right) \tag{2.69}
$$

Equation (2.69) shows the relationship between Growth Rate in Operating Income  $(g_{OI})$ , ROIC, Investment Rate (IR) and Dividend  $(Div)$ . Specifically, it shows how the key role is played by the ROIC. In fact:

- the higher the ROIC, the lower the Investment Rate (IR) must be to achieve the defined level of Growth Rate in Operating Income ( $g_{OI}$ ) and, other conditions being equal, the higher Dividends will be;
- the lower the ROIC, the higher the Investment Rate (IR) must be to achieve the defined level of Growth Rate in Operating Income  $(g_{OI})$  and, other conditions being equal, the lower the Dividends will be.

Three main aspects must be considered:

- first, with equal capital cost, function of the capital market, the higher the dividends and the higher company value as higher are the discounted dividends;
- second, as the value creation is the difference between the Return on Capital Invested and the cost of capital, the higher the ROIC than the capital cost, the higher the value creation in the event of faster growth;
- third, strictly related to the second point, when the ROIC is lower than capital cost, faster growth destroys company value. Specifically, if ROIC is lower than cost of capital, growing faster implies higher investments at a rate of return that destroys company value. Obviously, whenever the ROIC is equal to the cost of capital, the company value is neither created nor destroyed by the growth.

The second and the third points can be summarized as follows: with other equal conditions, a high ROIC is always positive; the same cannot be said of growth because it is only good if the ROIC is higher than the cost of capital. Consequently, a company with high ROIC and low Growth Rate may have a similar or even greater valuation than a company with higher Growth Rate but low ROIC. In other words, a company with a high ROIC can increase its value by increasing its Growth Rat rather than its ROIC. Otherwise, a company with a low ROIC can generate more value by focusing on the increase of its ROIC rather than on the increase of the Growth Rate. The concept can be summarized as follows: if a company has a high ROIC it should focus on improving Growth Rate; otherwise, if a company has

a low ROIC it should focus on improving ROIC before improving Growth Rate (Koller et al. 2015). As the higher the ROIC than the cost of capital (and the longer it can sustain a rate of return on that capital greater than its cost of capital), the greater is the creation of value, therefore it is critical to understand the drivers of the ROIC and assess impacts of every strategic and investment decision on them. The drivers of the ROIC are based in the Strategic Formula of the company.

## 2.4 Investment Analysis

The baseline concept of present value is that a dollar received in the future is less valuable than a dollar received today.

The main techniques for the investments analysis are the Net Present Value and the Internal Rate of Return (Benninga 2014; Brealey et al. 2016; Berk and DeMarzo 2008; Damodaran 2012, 2015; Vernimmen et al. 2014; Hillier et al. 2016; Koller et al. 2015; Copeland et al. 2004).

The present value (PV) is the baseline instrument to evaluate the profitability of an investment. The PV measures the present value of the future expected cash-flows  $(CF_{t})$  discounted at interest rate  $(i)$ , as follows:

$$
PV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{CF_{t}}{(1 + i)^{t}} \tag{2.72}
$$

It is possible to assume that cash-flows are expected to grow at the same constant growth rate  $(g_{n})$  in each period over time, as follows:

$$
PV = \frac{CF_{0}}{(1 + i)^{1}} + \frac{CF_{0} (1 + g_{n})^{1}}{(1 + i)^{2}} + \frac{CF_{0} (1 + g_{n})^{2}}{(1 + i)^{3}} + \dots + \frac{CF_{0} (1 + g_{n})^{n-1}}{(1 + i)^{n}}
$$

That can be generalised as follows:

$$
PV = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{CF_{0} \left(1 + g_{n}\right)^{t-1}}{(1 + i)^{t}} \tag{2.71}
$$

It is important to note that when  $g_{n} > i$  cash-flows ( $CF$ ) grow faster than they are discounted, the summation differences increase over time. The sum is infinite. It means that it is impossible to reproduce the cash-flows related to constant growth rate in perpetuity. In practice this type of eternity cannot exist. Consequently, the constant Growth Rate in perpetuity can be considered only if it is lower than the interest rate  $g_{n} < i$  so that each successive term in the sum is less than previous term. In this case the sum is finite (Corelli 2016).

The baseline equation to measure the investment capability to create value is the Net Present Value (NPV).

The NPV measures the value as a difference between the present value of future expected cash-in (CFI) less the cash-out (CFO) as follows:

$$
NPV = CFO_{(t_{0})} + \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac {CFI_{t}}{(1 + i)^{t}} \tag {2.72}
$$

Note that  $CFO$  is a negative value.

If the investment requires plus then one cash-out in different future years, Eq. (2.72) can be re-written as follows:

$$
NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac {CFO_{t}}{\left(1 + R_{f}\right)^{t}} + \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac {CFI_{t}}{\left(1 + i\right)^{t}} \tag {2.73}
$$

The Interest Rate  $(i)$  uses the time value of money through the risk-free rate  $\left(R_{f}\right)$  to discount cash-flows measures, plus the premium risk related to the riskiness of investment  $\left(P_{r}\right)$  related to effective execution of the future expected cash-in.

However, it has a different meaning with regards to cash-out and cash-in:

- cash-out are future but they are not expected. Therefore, they are not estimated but certain in their amount and time. Consequently, the interest rate used to discount them only measures the time value of money  $(i = R_f)$ ;
- cash-in are future and expected. Therefore, they are estimated and then uncertain in their effective amount. Consequently, the interest rate used to discount them measures the time value of money plus the premium risk  $(i = R_f + P_r)$ .

It is relevant to note that the risk related to future expected cash-in can be considered on the basis of two different and alternative approaches:

- the risk is considered in cash-in: in this case the expected future cash-in are "adjusted" on the basis of the probability of their realization and the interest rate measures only the time value of money  $(i = R_f)$ ;
- the risk is considered in interest rate: in this case the expected future cash-in is not adjusted for the probability of their achievement and the interest rate measure the time value of money plus the premium-risk  $(i = R_f + P_r)$ .

Note that the NPV is an amount. Consequently if it is a positive number, the investment is profitable and its profitability is equal to the positive amount of NPV; otherwise, if it is a negative number, the investment is not profitable and its loss is equal to the negative amount of NPV. Obviously the higher the NPV, the higher the investment profitability.

The Interest Rate of Return (IRR), also called Rate of Return (ROR) or Effective Interest Rate (EIR), is the rate at which it is assumed to discount the future cash-flows to obtain the initial cash-out. Therefore, the IRR measures the

# 2.4 Investment Analysis

profitability of the investment on the basis of its initial costs (cash-out) and able to generate future cash-flows that are reinvested at the same rate. It implies the same interest rate for all periods considered.

Therefore, IRR does not incorporate environmental factors, but it only considers the cash-flows generated by the investment.

In general terms, the IRR of an investment measures the annualized effective compounded return rate that makes Net Present Value (NPV) of investment equal to zero: it is the discount rate that makes the Net Present Value of cash-out of the investment equal to the Net Present Value of the cash-in of the investment. Formally:

$$
NPV = 0 \quad \rightarrow \quad \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CFO_{t}}{(1 + IRR)^{t}} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CFI_{t}}{(1 + IRR)^{t}} \tag{2.74}
$$

Based on Eq. (2.74) the higher a IRR, the more profitable the investment.

Note that IRR is an indicator of efficiency, quality and yield of investment, as opposed to NPV, which refers more to the value and magnitude of an investment.

By considering the IRR and the cost of capital, the firm has to prefer available investment opportunities where the expected IRR exceeds the cost of capital. Therefore, if the IRR is greater than the cost of capital, the expected return of investment exceeds the investors' expectation.

Assuming an investment project that requires an initial cash-out equal to  $A$  and several cash-in  $C_n$  over time, we have:

$$
A = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C_{t}}{(1 + i)^{t}} \quad \rightarrow \quad A - \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C_{t}}{(1 + i)^{t}} = 0
$$

The main problem is to define the value of Interest Rate  $i$  so that this equation is achieved. Therefore, the Interest Rate  $i$  is the IRR.

The problem can be solved by using the Newton's algorithm (Sydsaeter et al. 2012; Cesari 2012).

Assuming that the investment project requires a cash-out equal to  $A$  and it promises three cash-in  $C_1, C_2, C_3$  respectively in  $t_1, t_2, t_3$ . In this case, we have:

$$
A = \frac{C_{1}}{(1 + i)^{1}} + \frac{C_{2}}{(1 + i)^{2}} + \frac{C_{3}}{(1 + i)^{3}} \quad \rightarrow \quad A - \frac{C_{1}}{(1 + i)^{1}} + \frac{C_{2}}{(1 + i)^{2}} + \frac{C_{3}}{(1 + i)^{3}} = 0
$$

Defining a new variable  $\alpha$  as follows:

$$
\alpha = \frac {1}{1 + i}
$$

so that:

$$
A = C_{1} \cdot \alpha + C_{2} \cdot \alpha^{2} + C_{3} \cdot \alpha^{3} \quad \rightarrow \quad A - C_{1} \cdot \alpha + C_{2} \cdot \alpha^{2} + C_{3} \cdot \alpha^{3} = 0
$$

It is possible to define the function  $F(\alpha)$  as follows:

$$
F(\alpha) = A - C_{1} \cdot \alpha + C_{2} \cdot \alpha^{2} + C_{3} \cdot \alpha^{3} = 0 \tag{2.75}
$$

Generally, a polynomial of degree  $n$  can have  $n$  solutions.

By using the Cartesio's theorem (if in a polynomial of degree  $n$  the coefficient signs change one time, than the polynomial has one solution real and positive also if it is of degree  $n$ ), it is possible to say that IRR exists and is one.

Now the problem is to find this value of IRR. The Newton algorithm can be used as follows. The objective is to find the zero of the function  $F(\alpha)$  and therefore to find the value of  $\alpha$  so that the function is equal to zero.

Calculate the first derivative of the function  $F(\alpha)$  respect to the variable  $\alpha$  as following:

$$
\frac{\partial F(\alpha)}{\partial \alpha} = - C_{1} - 2 \cdot C_{2} \cdot \alpha - 3 \cdot C_{3} \cdot \alpha^{2}
$$

or in equivalent form (by denoting the first derivative as  $\frac{\partial F(\alpha)}{\partial\alpha} = F'(\alpha)$ ), we have:

$$
F^{\prime}(\alpha) = - C_{1} - 2 \cdot C_{2} \cdot \alpha - 3 \cdot C_{3} \cdot \alpha^{2} \tag{2.76}
$$

The analytical first derivative in a generic point  $\alpha_{s}$  can be approximated to the incremental ratio as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial F(\alpha_{s})}{\partial \alpha_{s}} \simeq \frac{F(\alpha_{s+1}) - F(\alpha_{s})}{\alpha_{s+1} - \alpha_{s}}
$$

and therefore:

$$
\lim_{\alpha_{s+1} \rightarrow \alpha_{s}} \frac{F(\alpha_{s+1}) - F(\alpha_{s})}{\alpha_{s+1} - \alpha_{s}} = \frac{F(\alpha_{s})}{\alpha_{s}} = \frac{\partial F(\alpha_{s})}{\partial \alpha_{s}}
$$

We have to find the Interest Rate able to have the function  $F(\alpha)$  equal to zero. Therefore, it is possible to assume  $F(\alpha_{s + 1}) = 0$  that is the objective value. In this case, it gets:

$$
\frac{\partial F(\alpha_{s})}{\partial \alpha_{s}} = \frac{- F(\alpha_{s})}{\alpha_{s+1} - \alpha_{s}}
$$

and by solving for  $\alpha_{s + 1}$  we have:

# 2.4 Investment Analysis

$$
\alpha_{s+1} = \alpha_{s} - \frac{F(\alpha_{s})}{\frac{\partial F(\alpha_{s})}{\partial \alpha_{s}}}
$$

by denoting the first derivative as  $\frac{\partial F(\alpha_s)}{\partial\alpha_s} = F'(\alpha_s)$ , we have:

$$
\alpha_{s+1} = \alpha_{s} - \frac{F(\alpha_{s})}{F^{\prime}(\alpha_{s})} \tag{2.77}
$$

Equation (2.77) defines the relationship between  $\alpha_{s+1}$  and  $\alpha_s$ . It is an numerical algorithm able to define interactively the value of IRR which makes the function  $F(\alpha) = 0$ .

On the basis of the equations of  $F(\alpha), F'(\alpha), \alpha_{s+1}$  it is possible to define the following procedure (Cesari 2012; Sydsaeter et al. 2012):

- step 1: assign to a  $\alpha$  any arbitrary value so that  $\alpha = \alpha_{1}$ , so that:

$$
\alpha_{1} = \frac{1}{1 + i_{1}}
$$

In this case it is a defined value (a number). Therefore, it is possible to calculate the Interest Rate  $i_1$  that it gives the defined value of  $\alpha_1$ :

$$
i_{1} = \frac{1}{\alpha_{1}} - 1
$$

- step 2: introduce the value  $\alpha_{1}$  in the function  $F(\alpha)$  and verify if it reaches a value near to zero  $F(\alpha) \simeq 0$ . In this sense, it is possible to introduce a convergence criterion. Specifically, if:

$$
| F(\alpha) | < \varepsilon \quad \rightarrow \quad F(\alpha) \simeq 0
$$

where  $\varepsilon$  is a positive value small enough to make that the  $F(\alpha)$  is near to zero.

Therefore, by introducing the value of  $\alpha_{1}$  in the function, if  $|F(\alpha_{1})| < \varepsilon$  the value of  $\alpha_{1}$  satisfies the convergence criterion and therefore  $F(\alpha_{1})\simeq 0$ . Therefore, the corresponding Interest Rate  $i_{1}$  is the IRR sought and the procedure is closed. If this does not happen, the procedure moves into step 3.

- step 3: calculate the first derivative in the point  $\alpha_{1}$  as follows:

$$
F^{\prime}(\alpha_{1}) = - C_{1} - 2 \cdot C_{2} \cdot \alpha_{1} - 3 \cdot C_{3} \cdot \alpha_{1}^{2}
$$

- step 4: calculate the new value  $\alpha_{2}$  on the basis of the  $\alpha_{1}$  as follows:

$$
\alpha_{s+1} = \alpha_{s} - \frac{F(\alpha_{s})}{F^{\prime}(\alpha_{s})}
$$

- step 5: introduce the value  $\alpha_{2}$  in the function  $F(\alpha)$  and if the convergence criterion is respected, so that:

$$
| F(\alpha_{2}) | < \varepsilon \quad \rightarrow \quad F(\alpha_{2}) \simeq 0
$$

the  $\alpha_{2}$  is correct and the corresponding Interest Rate  $i_{2}$  is the IRR sought and the procedure is closed. If it does not happen, the procedure starts again from step 3 with the definition of the first derivative of the function with  $\alpha_{2}F^{\prime}(\alpha_{2})$ , and the new definition of the  $\alpha_{3}$  in step 4 and its validation in step 5. The procedure continues interactively until the convergence criterion is respected in step 5.
