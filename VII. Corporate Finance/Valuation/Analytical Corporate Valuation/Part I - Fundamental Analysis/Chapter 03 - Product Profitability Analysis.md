Abstract In this third step of the fundamental company analysis, attention is placed on product profitability. Company ability to create profit over time is a function of product profitability. An analysis of product capability to create profit is not easy because it requires good knowledge of product cost in every time of company life. In this context product cost is analysed on the basis of two main approaches:

- direct product cost: it is based on the difference between variable and fixed costs:
- full product cost: it is based on the difference between direct costs and indirect costs.

The definition of the standard product cost is a part of the problem. The other part is the analysis includes the actual product cost as function of the actual company cost. Therefore, the last part of the chapter focuses on the difference between budget and actual Net Income on the basis of the variance analysis.

# 3.1 Direct Cost of Product

Profitability of the company is a function of product profitability. Therefore, to further understand the company's ability to create profit over time it is necessary to investigate into product profitability.

In each period of company life, the right definition and knowledge of the product cost is one of the most relevant success factors. It is fundamental for pricing of the product and subsequently for the right measurement of product profitability and, in general terms, for company profitability (Anthony et al. 2011; Garrison et al. 2014; Atrill and McLaney 2018; Banker et al. 2000; Bhimani et al. 2015; Drury 2016; Kaplan and Atkinson 1998; Sahaf 2013; Seal and Rohde 2014; Tennent 2014).

Therefore, with the correct measurement and knowledge in each period the product cost allows us to answer some fundamental questions such as: how much

did the product cost? What is the right price on the basis of production costs on the one hand, and market competition on the other? What is product profitability?

Consequently, the correct measurement of product cost is a fundamental for correct understanding of product profitability and company profitability over time.

The word "cost" is one of the most commonly used in accounting management. The most relevant problem is that the clear identification of cost requires a clear explanation. In fact, the word cost becomes more meaningful when it is preceded by a modifier in phrases such as direct cost, full cost, opportunity cost, differential cost, etc.

Before starting the analysis, it can be useful to define cost: cost is a measurement in monetary terms of the amount of resources used for a specific purpose (Anthony et al. 2011). Therefore, the cost requires three main structural elements:

- first, cost measures the use of resources in monetary terms. Cost then measures how many resources are used;
- second, cost is always expressed in monetary terms. Money represents the common denominator allowing the total amount of different resources, each of which is measured on the basis of its own scale. Therefore, thanks to money the total amount of the different resources used can be determined;
- third, cost must be defined always with regards to a well-defined cost object. The cost object can be anything for which monetary measurement of resources used is desired such as a product, a department, an activity, a project, a cost center, etc.

The correct determination of product margin requires the correct determination of product cost. It seems to be simple to define the product cost. Unfortunately, this simplicity is only apparent.

Usually, the wrong determination of product cost is one of the main elements of the wrong prediction of product margin and, on a general level, company profitability.

Before analysing the technique of product cost determination, it is necessary to introduce the different categories of costs.

It is worth noting that cost does not have a nature of its own with regards to its behaviour. Its classification with regards to its behaviour is function of the driver used for the analysis. In this sense, it is possible to define two main criteria of cost classification:

- Volume: costs and volume relationship;
Cost Object: costs and product relationship.

# Costs and Volume

In this case the driver used for the analysis of costs is volume. Therefore, the relationship between costs and volume is analysed.

The first question to be analysed is the measurement of volume. It must always be specified. It normally measures the level of activity. It can be defined on the basis of the volume of production, and therefore on the number of products produced, or

volume of sale and therefore the number of products sold. Normally production volume is considered rather than sales volume.

Based on volume, costs can be distinguished as follows (Anthony et al. 2011):

variable costs:
- fixed costs:
- semi-variable costs.

# Variable Cost

The Variable cost is an item of cost that varies, in total, directly and proportionately with volume but the variable cost per unit of volume remains constant. Therefore, the total cost is variable because the cost per unit of volume remains constant (Anthony et al. 2011).

Denoting with  $VC_{T}$  the Total Variable Cost,  $VC_{U}$  the Variable Cost per Unit of Volume,  $V$  the Volume, it gets:

$$
V C _ {T} = V C _ {U} \cdot V \tag {3.1}
$$

Equation (3.1) shows that  $VC_{T}$  increases with the increase of  $V$  because  $VC_{U}$  remains constant over time. This relationship can be represented as in Fig. 3.1.

Variable costs are normally considered:

- the cost of materials, semi-products and products necessary for the products sold;
- the cost of services for external processing;
- cost of commercial services connected directly with volume.

Other costs can be considered variable only if there is a direct relationship with the volume of products created.

Fig. 3.1 Total variable cost and variable cost per unit

Sometimes, in specific cases, salaries of direct labour can be considered as variable costs. The direct relationship between the amount of salaries and the volume of products created is necessary. Based on these constraints, labour costs are usually considered as fixed costs.

# Fixed Costs

The Fixed cost is an item of costs that, in total, does not change with volume. Consequently, the fixed cost per unit of volume decreases (increases) with the increase (decrease) of volume (Anthony et al. 2011).

There are two main constraints to be kept in mind:

- first, the cost is fixed with regards to volume only. It does not change with changes in volume. Otherwise, it changes for other reasons and specifically it changes in the case of management decisions on the item referenced:
- second, the cost is fixed within a defined production capacity and therefore within a defined volume of production. Out of the range, increases in volume require more production capacity, whose implementation increases fixed costs. Therefore, on the long term, assuming changes in the product capacity, all costs are variable.

Therefore, within a defined production capacity  $(V \leq V^{*})$  the total fixed cost remains constant while the fixed cost per unit decreases according to increases in volume.

Denoting with  $FC_{T}$  the total fixed cost,  $FC_{U}$  the fixed cost per unit of volume,  $V$  the volume, we have:

$$
F C _ {U} = \frac {F C _ {T}}{V} \quad f o r V \leq V ^ {*} \tag {3.2}
$$

Equation (3.2) shows how the fixed cost per unit of volume decreases (increase) to the increase (decrease) of volume. This relationship can be represented as in Fig. 3.2.

It is worth noting that by increasing the volume of product over a defined level  $(V^{*})$  the total fixed cost varies. The volume  $V^{*}$  represents the maximum number of products that can be achieved with the assets in place. It subsequently represents the maximum level of production capacity. Consequently, if the company increases volume within the defined production capacity  $(V \leq V^{*})$ , the total fixed cost remains constant and the fixed cost per unit decreases.

If the company wants to increase the volume of production over the level  $V^{*}$  ( $V > V^{*}$ ) it needs an increase in productivity capacity by the new assets and an increase in the amount of total fixed costs. Therefore, the difference between variable and fixed costs can only be achieved within a defined productivity capacity level as function of assets in place.

In this context fixed costs are considered all of those not related with product volume achieved or sales volumes such as administrative services expenses,

Fig. 3.2 Total fixed cost and fixed cost per unit

industrial and services expenses, leasing and rent expenses, all other costs for operating activities, amortizations and depreciations.

# (c) Semi-variable Costs

Unfortunately, it is not always easy to distinguish between variable and fixed costs. There are a lot of costs that can be defined as Semi-variable costs (or semi-fixed, partly variable, mixed costs). These costs are characterized by a combination of variable and fixed costs. It does not mean that they are divided exactly in half. The total amount of the semi-variable costs varies in the same direction, but less than proportionately with, changes in the volume of products achieved (Anthony et al. 2011). The dynamics of Semi-variable cost can be represented as shown in Fig. 3.3.

The relationship between volume and costs can be shown in a Cost-Volume Diagram. By considering all fixed or variable costs (by assuming that the semi-variable costs can be split into fixed and variable components) they can be illustrated approximately in two straight lines, with a linear approximation used to describe the relationship between volume and costs.

The general equation of a straight-line is the following:

$$
y = a + b x
$$

In our case:  $x$ , is the volume of products;  $y$ , is the total cost at a volume  $x$ ;  $a$ , is the vertical intercept and then the fixed cost;  $b$ , is the slope and then the rate of cost change per unit of volume change. Therefore, it is the unit variable cost.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/87fea16b-33f6-43ec-8056-5ef3565ac4c2/0780d0023e9b09fd80fe3749f2a120548bc89f0d6bea910236c779600b1ed1e2.jpg)
Fig. 3.3 Semi-variable costs

Denoting with:  $x = V; y = TC_{(V)}; a = FC_T; b = VC_U$  and substituting, we have:

$$
T C _ {(V)} = F C _ {T} + \left(V C _ {U} \cdot V\right) \tag {3.3}
$$

On an aggregate level, by considering that  $VC_{T}$  is equal to:

$$
V C _ {T} = V C _ {U} \cdot V
$$

Equation (3.3) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
T C _ {(V)} = F C _ {T} + V C _ {T} \tag {3.4}
$$

Equation (3.4) shows how the total cost at volume  $\mathrm{V} \left( TC_{(V)} \right)$  is equal to the total fixed costs  $\left( FC_{T} \right)$  plus the total variable costs  $\left( VC_{T} \right)$ .

Equation (3.3) can be represented as in Fig. 3.4.

It is worth noting that the straight line of total costs in Fig. 3.4. starts from the vertical intercept defined by the total fixed cost and is parallel to the straight line of total variable costs because they have the same slope.

By considering that the variable cost per unit is constant and the fixed cost per unit decreases according to the increase in volume within a defined production capacity  $(V \leq V^{*})$ , the total average cost per unit of volume is equal to the total cost divided per volume and therefore it decreases according to the increase in volume. Therefore, the total average cost per unit of volume behaves quite differently than total costs due to the different behaviour of fixed costs per unit and variable costs per unit (Anthony et al. 2011).

More specifically, when volume increases within a defined production capacity  $(V \leq V^{*})$ , the total variable costs increase while the total fixed cost remains constant.

Fig. 3.4 Fixed cost, variable cost and total cost

Denoting  $TC_{U}$  the total average cost per unit of volume,  $FC_{U}$  the fixed cost per unit of volume,  $VC_{U}$  the variable cost per unit of volume, we have:

$$
T C _ {U} = F C _ {U} + V C _ {U} \tag {3.5}
$$

The variable cost per unit of volume  $(VC_{U})$  is constant. On the other hand, the total average cost per unit of volume  $(TC_{U})$  and the fixed cost per unit of volume  $(FC_{U})$  are functions of Volume  $V$ . Specifically,  $TC_{U}$  is equal to the total cost at a volume  $V$ $(TC_{(V)})$  divided by volume  $V$ , as well as  $FC_{U}$  is equal to total fixed cost  $(FC_{T})$  divided the volume  $V$ , as follows:

$$
T C _ {U} = \frac {T C _ {(V)}}{V} \tag {3.6}
$$

and

$$
F C _ {U} = \frac {F C _ {T}}{V} \tag {3.7}
$$

On the basis of Eqs. (3.6) and (3.7), the (3.5) can be re-written as follows:

$$
\frac {T C _ {(V)}}{V} = \frac {F C _ {T}}{V} + V C _ {U} \leftrightarrow T C _ {U} = \frac {F C _ {T}}{V} + V C _ {U} \tag {3.8}
$$

Therefore, with an increase of volume  $(V)$  within a defined prediction capacity  $(V \leq V^{*})$  the total cost per unit of volume  $(TC_{U})$  decreases with the increase of

Fig. 3.5 Total cost per unit of volume

volume  $(V)$  because the fixed cost per unit of volume  $(FC_{U})$  decreases with the increase of volume  $(V)$  while the variable cost per unit of volume  $(VC_{U})$  remains constant. These relationships can be represented as in Fig. 3.5.

Figure 3.5 shows how the total average cost per unit of volume  $(TC_{U})$  is parallel to the fixed cost per unit  $(FC_{U})$ . In fact, the reduction of the total cost per unit is due to the reduction of the fixed cost per unit.

The variable cost per unit  $(VC_{U})$  represents a constant and therefore it is independent of the volume  $(V)$  and then increases the starting point of the total cost per unit of volume. By expanding the production to the volume  $V^{*}$  and assuming that the level of volume  $V^{*}$  is infinite, the fixed cost per unit is equal to zero, the total average cost per unit of volume is equal to the variable cost per unit of volume, as follows:

$$
\lim  _ {V \rightarrow V ^ {*} = + \infty} T C _ {U} = \lim  _ {V \rightarrow V ^ {*} = + \infty} \left[ \frac {F C _ {T}}{V} + V C _ {U} \right] = V C _ {U} \tag {3.9}
$$

In a real world  $V^{*}$  cannot be infinite. Therefore, we have:

$$
\lim  _ {V \rightarrow V ^ {*}} T C _ {U} = \lim  _ {V \rightarrow V ^ {*}} \left[ \frac {F C _ {T}}{V} + V C _ {U} \right] = \alpha + V C _ {U} \tag {3.10}
$$

where the value of  $\alpha$  is the fixed cost per unit of volume for use of the maximum production capacity. Therefore, it is function of the quality and characteristics of the production system and managerial skills.

Therefore, as the volume increases within a defined production capacity  $(V \leq V^{*})$  there is an inverse relationship between total fixed costs and fixed costs per unit of volume, as well as between total variable costs and variable costs per unit of volume. Specifically, to the increase of volume we have:

- the total fixed cost remains constant, while the fixed cost per unit of volume reduces;
- the total variable cost increases, while the variable cost per unit of volume remains constant.

These movements imply that if the volume increases the total cost increases while the total average cost per unit of volume decreases.

The total average cost per unit of volume has relevant managerial implications. It generates the cost per unit of volume by distinguishing all fixed and variable costs. Therefore, it plays a key role in the product price decision. The difference between revenues and cost per unit of volume defines the margin per unit of volume. By multiplying the margin per unit of volume per volume of product sold, we have profit (loss) of the company.

Denoting with  $R_U$  the revenues per unit of volume,  $TC_U$  the total average cost per unit of volume,  $M_U$  the profit margin per unit of volume,  $V$  the volume of product,  $M_T$  the total margin of the company and therefore the profit (if it is positive) or loss (if it is negative) of the company, we have:

$$
M _ {U} = R _ {U} - T C _ {U} \tag {3.11}
$$

and then:

$$
M _ {U} \cdot V = R _ {U} \cdot V - T C _ {U} \cdot V \leftrightarrow M _ {U} \cdot V = \left(R _ {U} - T C _ {U}\right) \cdot V \tag {3.12}
$$

Considering that the margin per unit of volume is the total margin  $(M_T)$ , the revenues per unit of volume for volume are the total revenues  $(R_T)$  and the total average cost per unit of volume for volume is total costs  $(C_T)$ , we have:

$$
M _ {T} = R _ {T} - C _ {T} \rightarrow\begin{array}{l l}M _ {T} = \text {P r o f i t}&\text {i f} R _ {T} > C _ {T} \rightarrow R _ {U} > T C _ {U}\\M _ {T} = \text {L o s s}&\text {i f} C _ {T} > R _ {T} \rightarrow R _ {U} <   T C _ {U}\end{array}\tag {3.13}
$$

The relationship between volume and costs as defined, is based on several conditions. They are truly restrictive and they must always be kept in mind to avoid misunderstandings and errors in decision processes. There are five main ones (Anthony et al. 2011):

(1) Range of volume: costs move along a straight-line only within a defined range of volume. Therefore, a single straight line gives a good approximation of the cost behaviour only within a defined and well specified range of volume that defines the Relevant Range. Only the relevant range must be considered in the analysis.

(2) Length of the time period: the amount of variable costs is a function of the time period over which cost behaviour is being estimated. If the time period is only one day, few costs can be defined as variable. If the time period is one year, many more costs are variable. If the time period is infinite, all costs are variable. Therefore, the time period must be always defined and the relevant time period must be defined. Only the relevant time period must be considered in the analysis. The relevant time period is normally one year.
(3) Stickiness of costs: very few costs can be defined as truly variable costs. Usually they decrease or increase together with volume decreases and they increase more or less when volume increases. Also, they change more or less within a specific period of volume. These are defined as Sticky Costs (Anderson et al. 2003). Generally, the costs that are incurred at manager's discretion are stickier. The degree of stickiness varies across cost types and company types.
(4) Environment: it is assumed that cost varies with volume only. All other variables are considered constant. The many changes due to the economic environment are not considered.
(5) Linear assumption: the relationship between volume and costs assumes that costs change with volume along a straight line. In practice this assumption is often not valid because the costs move along a curve rather than a straight line. This assumption can be used if in the relevant range and relevant time period considered, the curve can be approximated by a straight line. Also step function costs are more common than these curvilinear costs.

We have defined the total cost as the sum of total fixed costs and total variable costs. Similarly, the unit cost of a product is equal to the sum of unit variable costs and unit fixed costs. Since the unit variable cost remains constant to the increase in volume, while the unit fixed cost decreases to the increase of volume, to the increase of volume the unit cost per product decreases.

For a deep analysis, the marginal cost must be considered for the total cost of products and the unit cost of products: it is a baseline concept in economics and it measures the increase in total costs due to the increase in production of one extra unit. Therefore, the marginal cost is the cost of any additional unit of product to be produced.

A relevant relationship can be defined between the marginal cost and total unit cost:

- if the marginal cost for one additional unit is less than total unit cost, then the total unit cost decreases;
- if the marginal cost for one additional unit is higher than total unit cost, then the total unit cost increases;
- if the marginal cost for one additional unit is equal to the total unit cost, the curve in that point is flat.

Fig. 3.6 Relationship between marginal cost and total unit cost

On the long term, and therefore for different levels of production, the relationship between marginal costs  $(C_M)$  and total unit cost  $(TC_U)$  can be represented as in Fig. 3.6.

The most relevant indicator based on the relationship between volume and costs is the Contribution Margin (CMor  $\mathrm{CM_T}$ ) and the Unit Contribution Margin  $(\mathrm{CM_U})$ .

It measures the rigidity/flexibility level of the company's cost structure. It can focus on the Operating Income or on Net Income. In the first case only operating revenues and costs are considered; in the second case, all revenues and costs are considered as indicated in Table 3.1.

The Contribution Margin is based on the difference between fixed and variable costs. The difference between revenues and total variable costs defines the Total Contribution Margin, while the difference between the revenue per unit of volume and the variable cost per unit of volume defines the Unit Contribution Margin.

The Contribution Margin measures the company's ability to cover the fixed costs.

The unit contribution margin  $(\mathrm{CM_U})$  or contribution margin per unit of volume, measures the difference between the revenue per unit of volume  $(R_U)$  and variable cost per unit of volume  $(VC_{U})$ . Formally:

$$
C M _ {U} = R _ {U} - V C _ {U} \tag {3.14}
$$

It is important to point out that the unit contribution margin remains constant per unit of volume  $(V)$  because the variable cost per unit of volume is constant.

Consequently, the contribution margin  $(CM)$  varies according to volume changes because the unit contribution margin  $(CM_U)$  remains constant per unit of volume. Formally:

$$
C M _ {T} = C M _ {U} \cdot V \leftrightarrow C M _ {T} = \left(R _ {U} - V C _ {U}\right) \cdot V \tag {3.15}
$$

By distinguishing costs between variable and fixed costs, the marginal income  $(MI)$  can be computed based on the unit contribution margin as follows:

# 3.1 Direct Cost of Product

$$
M I = C M _ {U} \cdot V - F C _ {T} \leftrightarrow M I = \left(R _ {U} - V C _ {U}\right) \cdot V - F C _ {T} \tag {3.16}
$$

It is worth noting that if only operating revenues and costs are considered, the marginal income is the EBIT; otherwise, if all revenues and costs are considered, the marginal income is the Net Income.

The analytical scheme of the Contribution Margin is commonly used by both internal and external analysts because it allows for greater understanding of the effects of the Operating Revenue changes on Operating Income and therefore on Net Income due to the rigidity level of the cost structure.

The information required is usually confidential and arising from management accounts. In any case, the external analyst can use a proxy based on the characteristics of cost categories.

The relationship between volume and costs can be used to define the break-even point. It defines the equilibrium-volume at which the total costs are equal to the total revenues. Therefore, for a volume higher than the equilibrium-volume, the company generates profit; otherwise, for a volume lower than equilibrium-volume, the company generate loss. The amount of profit or loss expected at any volume level is the vertical distance between the points on the total cost and total revenue lines at that volume (Anthony et al. 2011).

Denote with  $V$  the volume,  $R_{T}$  the total revenue at any volume,  $C_{T}$  the total cost at any volume,  $P_{U}$  the unit price,  $VC_{U}$  the variable cost per unit of volume,  $FC_{T}$  the total fixed costs.

The equilibrium-volume is the volume at which the total revenues are equal to the total costs, and therefore:

$$
R _ {T} = C _ {T} \quad\begin{array}{l}R _ {T} = P _ {U} \cdot V\\C _ {T} = F C _ {T} + (V C _ {U} \cdot V)\end{array}\rightarrow P _ {U} \cdot V = F C _ {T} + (V C _ {U} \cdot V)
$$

and consequently:

$$
V _ {(E)} = \frac {F C _ {T}}{P _ {U} - V C _ {U}} \tag {3.17}
$$

Equation (3.17) shows how the equilibrium-volume  $(V_{(E)})$  is equal to the total fixed costs  $(FC_{T})$  divided for the unit contribution margin  $(P_U - VC_U)$ .

On the basis of Eq. (3.17) the volume achieved  $(V)$  must be compared with the equilibrium-volume  $(V_{(E)})$  as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} V = V _ {(E)} \rightarrow R _ {T} = C _ {T} E q u i l i b r i u m \\ V > V _ {(E)} \rightarrow R _ {T} > C _ {T} P r o f i t \\ V <   V _ {(E)} \rightarrow R _ {T} <   C _ {T} L o s s \\ \end{array}
$$

It is easy to extend the break-even analyses to the case in which a profit target  $(Pr^{(*)})$  is defined. In this case, we have:

$$
P r ^ {(*)} = R _ {T} - C _ {T}
$$

$$
P r ^ {(*)} = P _ {U} \cdot V - [ F C _ {T} + (V C _ {U} \cdot V) ] = V \cdot (P _ {U} - V C _ {U}) - F C _ {T}
$$

The volume  $(V)$  is the volume that can achieve the profit target  $(V_{P_{(T)}})$ . Therefore, by solving for the volume  $(V \equiv V_{P_{(T)}})$ , it gets:

$$
V _ {P _ {(T)}} = \frac {P r ^ {(*)} + F C _ {T}}{P _ {U} - V C _ {U}} \tag {3.18}
$$

The volume able to achieve the profit target  $(V_{P_{(T)}})$  is equal to the sum between the profit target defined  $(Pr^{(*)})$  and the total fixed costs  $(FC_{T})$  divided up into the unit contribution margin  $(P_U - VC_U)$ . The equation can be shown as in Fig. 3.7.

By using a unit contribution margin, a graph of contribution profit can be created, as shown in Fig. 3.8 (Anthony et al. 2011).

In Fig. 3.8 the vertical axis shows income. The main components for the analysis of the graph are the following:

- profit is equal to zero for a volume equal to  $V_{(E)}$  representing the break-even volume (the equilibrium volume between revenues and costs);
- the slope is the unit contribution margin and then the contribution margin per unit of volume;
- at zero volume the loss is due to the total fixed costs.

Fig. 3.8 Contribution profit

The relationships previously analysed refers to company with a single product. If the company achieves more than one product with different contribution margins, the product mix must be calculated (Anthony et al. 2011).

If the proportion of each product's sales to the total remains constant (and therefore the product mix remains constant over time), it is possible to calculate the weighted-average unit contribution margin for all products (also called unit contribution margin of equivalent product) rather than the individual unit contribution margin of any product.

Considering two products:  $A$  and  $B$ . The company's Net Income ( $NI$ ) is equal to the sum of contribution margin of product A ( $CM_{(A)}$ ) and contribution margin of product B ( $CM_{(B)}$ ) less the total fixed costs ( $FC_T$ ).

The contribution margin is equal to the unit contribution margin  $(CM_U)$  (equal to the difference between price per unit  $(P_U)$  and unit variable cost  $(VC_U)$ ) multiplied by the quantity of product  $(Q)$ . Therefore, we have:

$$
N I = \left\{\left[ \left(P _ {U (A)} \cdot Q _ {(A)}\right) + \left(P _ {U (B)} \cdot Q _ {(B)}\right) \right] - \left[ \left(V C _ {U (A)} \cdot Q _ {(A)}\right) + \left(V C _ {U (B)} \cdot Q _ {(B)}\right) \right] \right\} - F C _ {T}
$$

$$
N I = \left[ \left(P _ {U (A)} - V C _ {U (A)}\right) \cdot Q _ {(A)} + \left(P _ {U (B)} - V C _ {U (B)}\right) \cdot Q _ {(B)} \right] - F C _ {T}
$$

and then:

$$
\begin{array}{l}C M _ {U (A)} = P _ {U (A)} - V C _ {U (A)}\\C M _ {U (B)} = P _ {U (B)} - V C _ {U (B)}\end{array}\rightarrow N I = \left(C M _ {U (A)} \cdot Q _ {(A)} + C M _ {U (B)} \cdot Q _ {(B)}\right) - F C _ {T}
$$

If the product mix is defined and well-known, the weighted percentage  $(W(\%))$  of each product volume  $(Q_{(A)}; Q_{(B)})$  on total volume  $(Q_{(T)})$  can be calculated:

$$
Q _ {(T)} = Q _ {(A)} + Q _ {(B)} \rightarrow\begin{array}{c}W _ {A} (\%) = \frac {Q _ {(A)}}{Q _ {(T)}}\\W _ {B} (\%) = \frac {Q _ {(B)}}{Q _ {(T)}}\end{array}
$$

By replacing it, we have:

$$
N I = \left(C M _ {U (A)} \cdot W _ {A} (\%) \cdot Q _ {(T)} + C M _ {U (B)} \cdot W _ {B} (\%) \cdot Q _ {(T)}\right) - F C _ {T}
$$

$$
N I = \left[ \left(C M _ {U (A)} \cdot W _ {A} (\%) + C M _ {U (B)} \cdot W _ {B} (\%)\right) \cdot Q _ {(T)} \right] - F C _ {T}
$$

Denoting with  $CM_{U(E)}$  the weighted-average unit contribution margin for all products (or unit contribution margin of equivalent product), we have:

$$
C M _ {U (E)} = C M _ {U (A)} \cdot W _ {A} (\%) + C M _ {U (B)} \cdot W _ {B} (\%)
$$

and then:

$$
N I = \left(C M _ {U (E)} \cdot Q _ {(T)}\right) - F C _ {T} \tag {3.19}
$$

# 3.2 Full Cost of Product

The full cost defines all resources used for a defined cost object that can be anything for which the cost is measured. With regards to any well defined cost object, the main difference is between direct cost and indirect cost (Anthony et al. 2011; Garrison et al. 2014).

# Direct Cost

Direct cost is a cost that is specifically "traced to", or "caused by", that "cost object". Therefore, it is always possible to identify a clear and objective causal-relationship between the cost and the cost object. The direct cost is "attributed" to the cost object because they are "directly charged" to the cost object (Anthony et al. 2011). It is possible to identify three main types of direct cost:

(a) Direct Material Cost: it refers to the quantities of material that can be specifically identified with a cost object in an economically feasible manner, priced at the unit price of direct material. The measurement of the Direct Material Cost is characterized by two main aspects: (1) the quantity of material needed for each cost object and (2) the price per unit (cost per unit) of material. These materials are often called raw materials or simple materials;

(b) Direct Labour Cost: it refers to the labour quantities that can be specifically identified with a cost object in an economically feasible manner, priced at a unit price of direct labour. Specifically, the earnings of workers who assemble parts and transform them into finished goods or operate machines for production are direct labour costs of the product. The measurement of Direct Labour Costs is

characterized by two main aspects: (1) the quantity of labour time and (2) the price per unit (cost per unit) of labour time. It is worth noting that labour regulations are normally subject to the law. Therefore, the difference between Direct Labour and Indirect Labour tend to be blurred;

(c) Other Direct Costs: it refers to any cost due to goods and services traced to a single cost object. The costs must be identifiable with a single cost object. The measurement of each Other Direct Cost is based on two elements: (1) the quantity of services or goods required for each cost object and (2) the price per unit of goods and services (or cost per unit of goods and services). However, most companies only classify direct materials and direct labour costs as direct costs and they consider all other costs as indirect costs.

# Indirect Cost

Indirect costs are costs "associated with", or "caused by", two or more "cost objects jointly". Therefore, unlike the direct costs, it is not directly traced to each of the cost objects. In this case, it is not possible, or at least not feasible, to define a clear and objective causal-relationship between the cost and each cost object separately. Consequently, it is not possible or feasible, to measure directly how much of the cost is attributable to a single cost object (Anthony et al. 2011).

Generally, there are three reasons for which cost is not traced directly to a cost object: (1) it is impossible to do; (2) it is not feasible to do; (3) management chooses not to do.

The Indirect Cost is "allocated" to the cost object on the basis of the allocation rate (or absorption rate). They include (Anthony et al. 2011):

(a) Indirect Cost of Material: it represents the cost of production materials not caused by a specific cost object. Therefore, this cost refers to materials used in the production process but not directly traced to individual cost objects;
(b) Indirect Labour Cost: it is a labour cost not related to a specific cost object. Therefore, unlike direct labour cost, employee efforts are related to the entire process of production;
(c) Other costs: they refer to all other costs of the company that are not caused by a specific cost object.

On the basis of these two definitions, it is clear how the terms "Direct" and "Indirect" are meaningful only in the context of a specified cost object.

In the business the most relevant cost object is the product. In fact, the correct definition of product cost allows for the definition of the product price on the basis of its costs on the one hand, and the market competition on the other hand. Therefore, the correct definition of the product cost is fundamental to understand product profitability and therefore company profitability.

The product costing system is the system that accumulates and reports product costs.

It is worth noting that the common confusion between direct costs and variable costs is very wrong as well as the confusion between indirect costs and fixed costs. This confusion occurs because if the cost object is a product, there are many costs

directly connected with the product that are also variable with production volume of the product. Similarly, several costs that are indirect to the product are also fixed with the production volume of the product. Although it seems true, it is wrong to use direct costs and variable costs as synonyms as well as indirect costs and fixed costs. In fact, the direct/indirect cost dichotomy and variable/fixed cost dichotomy are included in a different concept: while the direct/indirect cost dichotomy relates to the traceability of costs to specific cost object and therefore it is an accountant's concept, the variable/fixed cost dichotomy relates to the behaviour of cost as volume fluctuates and therefore it is a economist's concept (Anthony et al. 2011).

In order to define the full cost of product, on the basis of the distinction between Direct and Indirect costs of product, it is possible to define several cost configurations (Anthony et al. 2011):

(a) Conversion Cost: it refers to the sum of Direct Labour Cost and Indirect Production Costs. Therefore, it includes all production costs needed to convert Direct Materials into finished products;
(b) Full Production Cost: it refers to the sum between the Direct Material Cost and Conversion Cost. It can also be defined as the sum between Direct Costs and Indirect Production Costs.

Therefore, the Full Production Costs do not include distribution or selling costs, or those general and administrative costs that are unrelated to production operations.

(c) Non-production Cost: it refers to the all costs incurred in an organization other than production costs, such as selling costs, research and development costs, general and administrative costs and interest costs.
(d) Full Cost of Product: it is the sum of Full Production Cost and Non-production Cost. Therefore, it is simply the sum of all the cost elements described above. One of the most common errors is to consider Full Cost of Product the Production Costs only or, even worse, the only Direct Material Costs. It has relevant negative implications because the Full Cost of Product is the basis on which the pricing is defined.

It is possible to summarize the Full Cost of Product as in Fig. 3.9.

On the basis of these cost configurations, it is possible to define the full cost of product as the sum of direct costs attributed to the product plus a fair-share of indirect costs allocated to the product.

This definition is only apparently simple. The most relevant problem is the right definition, in monetary terms, of the "fair-share" of the indirect costs to be allocated to each product.

The most common way to define the fair share is the proportion of indirect costs caused by each of the various cost objects. In this sense it is used the allocation rate (or absorption rate).

One of the most useful techniques is the step-down order procedure. It requires the definition of two different cost objects:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/87fea16b-33f6-43ec-8056-5ef3565ac4c2/c5fbbc8091f7c1da25ce5637c6c0f47098e1e49379cbb1d4e5fe7f771e90f14b.jpg)
Fig. 3.9 Full cost of product

(a) cost of product: the final cost object is the product. Therefore, in this case it can be distinguished between direct and indirect cost of product;
(b) cost of production and service centers: they are intermediate cost objects and they are necessary for the application of the step-down order procedure. Therefore, in this case it can be distinguished between direct and indirect cost of cost centers.

The operative procedure to define the full cost of product, can be organised in six main steps.

Step 1: Identification of Direct and Indirect Costs of Product

The first step of the procedure requires the distinction between direct and indirect costs with regards to the product. Therefore, for each item of cost its Direct Cost or Indirect Cost must be defined.

Direct cost is specifically "traced to", or "caused by", that "Product". Therefore, it is always possible to identify a clear and objective causal relationship between the cost and the product. They are: Direct Material Costs, Direct Labour Costs and Other Direct Costs.

Direct Material Costs refer to the quantities of material required for each product priced at the unit price of direct material. Therefore, the Direct Material Cost for each product is obtained by multiplying (1) the quantity of material required for each product and (2) the price per unit of material (or cost per unit of material). These materials are often called raw materials or simple materials.

Direct Labour Costs refer to the quantities of labour required for each product priced at a unit price of direct labour. Therefore, Direct Labour Costs for each

product are obtained by multiplying (1) the quantity of labour time needed for each product and (2) the price per unit of labour time (or cost per unit of labour time).

Other Direct Costs refer to the quantities of services or goods required for each product priced at the unit price. Therefore, every other direct cost for each product is obtained by multiplying (1) the quantity of goods and service required for each product and (2) the price per unit of good and service (or cost per unit of goods and services).

Direct Material Costs, Direct Labour Costs and Other Direct Costs are Direct Costs and they are "attributed" to the product.

Indirect costs are all of the costs that are not directly caused by the product for three main reasons: (1) it is impossible to do; (2) it is not feasible to do; (3) management chooses not to do.

These costs must be "allocated" to the product by using Production and Service Centers.

At the end of this first step of the process, all company costs are distinguished between direct and indirect cost of products.

Consequently, the sum of direct and indirect product costs must be equal to the sum of all company costs. This is the first checkpoint of the process.

Step 2: Assignment of Indirect Cost of Product to Production and Service Cost Centers

In this second step, it is necessary to "attribute" and to "allocate" the indirect cost of product to the Cost Centers.

A cost center is a cost object in which costs are accumulated. In a production cost system, items of cost are first accumulated in cost centers and then assigned to products. Therefore, in this step the cost object is not the product but the cost center. For this reason, they are often called an "intermediate cost object" to create distinction from the product that is the final cost object.

In other terms the allocation of indirect costs to product (the final cost object) requires that these costs are allocated in advance to the cost centers (the intermediate cost object). Therefore, all indirect costs of period must be assigned to the Production and Services Costs.

By considering cost centers as the cost object, two types of costs can be distinguished:

(1) Direct Cost of Cost Center: it refers to any indirect cost (with regards to the product object) item that can be uniquely associated with a cost center that is directly charged to that center. In this case, cost items are attributed to the cost center, one cost item at a time on the basis of a clear relationship between the cost and the cost center;
(2) Indirect Cost of Cost Center: it refers to any indirect cost (with regards to the product object) that benefit from several cost centers jointly are allocated to those centers. In this case, cost items that are allocated to the centers, different allocation rates may be used for different items. Therefore, every cost item is assigned to the cost center, one cost item at a time on the basis of a specific

allocation rate. Therefore, there must be a fair share of indirect costs on each cost center.

There are two main types of Cost Centers:

(1) Production Cost Center: the center (i) produces a product or a component of a product or (ii) performs a distinct step or task of such production;
(2) Service Cost Center: the center provides services to production cost centers or to other service cost centers or to general company activities. Note that not all service cost centers are identifiable organization units.

Therefore, each Production and Service Cost Center is characterized by a direct cost attributed plus a fair share of indirect costs.

At the end of this second step of the process, all indirect product costs are assigned to the Production Cost Centers and Service Cost Centers.

Consequently, the sum of the costs assigned to the Production Cost Centers and the costs assigned to the Service Cost Centers must be equal to the entire indirect costs of product. This is the second checkpoint of the process.

Step 3: Identification of the Primary and Secondary Service Cost

At this point in the process, all indirect costs assigned to Service Cost Centers must be assigned to the Product Cost Centers. Indeed, all Production Cost Centers can be attributed directly or allocated by an allocation rate to the product.

The reassignment of costs assigned to the Service Cost Centers to the Product Cost Centers, can be achieved by following a step-down order procedure. This procedure is complex but it is more accurate in the definition of the full product cost. On the basis of step-down order costs assigned to Service Cost Centers can be:

- attributed directly or allocated indirectly on the basis of allocation rates to the Product Cost Centers;
- attributed directly or allocated indirectly on the basis of allocation rates to the other Service Cost Centers and then from these to the Product Cost Centers through direct attribution or allocation.

Therefore, it is possible to distinguish between two different types of Service Cost Centers:

(1) Primary Service Cost Center: the costs assigned to the Service Cost Center are attributed directly or allocated through allocation rates to the Production Cost Centers that receive the service;
(2) Secondary Service Cost Center: the costs assigned to the Service Cost Center are attributed directly or allocated through allocation rates to the other Service Cost Centers that receive the service.

Therefore, only the costs included in the Primary Service Cost Centers can be assigned to the Production Cost Centers. Consequently, the Secondary Service Cost Centers are emptied.

Consequently, each Primary Service Cost Center is characterized by its original costs assigned plus a fair share of costs of the Secondary Service Cost Centers.

At the end of this third step of the process, all service costs are assigned to the Primary Service Cost Centers.

Consequently, the sum of the costs assigned to the Primary Service Cost Centers must be equal to the entire indirect service costs. This is the fourth checkpoint of the process;

Step 4: Reassignment of Service Cost Centers to the Production Cost Centers

At this fourth step of the process, the costs assigned to the Primary Service Cost Centers must be attributed directly or allocated through allocation rates to the Production Cost Centers. Consequently, the Primary Service Cost Centers are emptied.

Therefore, each Production Cost Center is characterized by its original costs assigned plus a fair share of costs of the Primary Service Cost Centers.

At the end of this fourth step of the process, all costs assigned to the Primary Service Cost Centers must be assigned to the Production Cost Centers.

Consequently, the sum of costs assigned to the Production Cost Centers must be equal to the sum of all indirect costs of product. This is the fifth checkpoint of the process.

Step 5: Identification of the Primary and Secondary Production Cost Centers

In this fifth step of the process, the costs assigned to the Production Cost Centers must be attributed or allocated through the allocation rates to the product.

Also in this case, it is possible to distinguish two types of Production Cost Centers:

(1) Primary Production Cost Center: the costs assigned to the Production Cost Centers are attributed directly or allocated through allocation rates to the product that receives the service;

(2) Secondary Cost Center: the costs assigned to the Production Cost Center are attributed directly or allocated through allocation rates to the other Production Cost Centers that receive the service.

Therefore, only the costs included in the Primary Production Cost Centers can be assigned to the Product. Consequently, the Secondary Production Cost Centers are emptied.

Therefore, each Primary Production Cost Center is characterized by its original costs assigned plus a fair share of costs of the Secondary Production Cost Centers.

At the end of this fifth step of process, all production costs are assigned to the Primary Production Cost Centers.

Consequently, the sum of the costs assigned to the Primary Production Cost Centers must be equal to the entire indirect production costs. This is the fifth checkpoint of the process.

Step 6: Assignment of the costs in Primary Production Cost Centers to product

In this sixth step of process, the costs assigned in the Primary Production Cost Centers must be attributed directly or allocated through allocation rates to the product.

Two different types of production system can be distinguished (Anthony et al. 2011):

(1) Process cost system: in this case, the costs in a defined period are considered. Therefore, all costs included in the Primary Production Cost Centers in the period are divided up into the quantity of products manufactured in the same period. Therefore, the unit cost per product is an average unit cost per product: total product costs divided by the quantity of products manufactured during the same period. Consequently, it is not possible to have different costs among a single unit of product. It is worth noting that since a time period is considered, it is possible that at the end of the period there are several products that have not yet been manufactured. In this case, it must be used a common unit for the products manufactured and the products not yet manufactured. This common unit is the equivalent unit of production: this unit is equivalent to the complete unit. In this case the inventory at the start of the period must be considered, plus the product manufactured in the period divided by the equivalent unit of production in the period.

(2) Job order cost system: in this case the cost of each job order is formed independently according to the period in which the activities are carried out. Each job order must border a share-part of the costs included in Primary Production Cost Centers according to their acquired services. The main problem is that each job order is characterized by a different use of each Primary Production Cost Center. In this case, different allocation rates must be used for one Primary Production Cost Center. Therefore, each Primary Production Cost Center uses one single allocation rate to allocate its costs to each order.

Each Primary Production Cost Center is characterized by its original costs assigned plus a fair share of costs of the Secondary Production Cost Centers.

At the end of this sixth step of the process, all costs assigned to the Primary Production Cost Centers must be assigned to the Product.

Consequently, the sum of costs assigned to the Production Cost Centers must be equal to the sum of all indirect costs of product. This is the sixth checkpoint of the process.

# Step 7: Definition of the Full Cost of Product

In this last step of the process, Direct Costs with regards to Direct Material Costs, Labour Costs and Other Direct Costs should be added to the Indirect Costs assigned to each product.

The Full Product Cost is obtained by summing the Direct Cost attributed to the product and the Indirect Costs allocated to the product through the Primary Production Cost Centers. Therefore, the Unit Cost of Product is equal to the Direct Costs plus the share-part of Indirect Costs.

Consequently, by multiplying the Cost per Unit of Product for the quantity of product manufactured, total company costs are achieved. This is the seventh checkpoint of the process.

The entire process as described on the basis of these seven steps, can be summarized as in Fig. 3.10.

In the entire procedure as defined in seven steps, a key role is played by the allocation bases also called cost drivers.

The allocation bases should express, in as far as is possible, a causal relationship between the costs and the cost object that are the cost centers (intermediate cost object) and the product (final cost object). It is possible to use several alternative allocation bases to allocate indirect costs either to cost center and to product. They are usually defined on the basis of the specific characteristic of the company.

The main problem of the allocation rate is the time in which it is defined. Each allocation rate is defined in advance once a year before the beginning of the accounting year. Therefore, they are predetermined. Consequently, predetermined allocation rates are defined once a year before the start of the year and they are used throughout the year (Anthony et al. 2011).

It implies that amounts used to indicate the activity levels and costs estimated for the forthcoming year rather than their actual levels. Consequently, the value of the allocation rates is always expected and not actual. It implies that the procedure to compute the product cost through the procedure analysed previously (the seven steps) is based in the estimated value and not on actual values. Consequently, the product cost is estimated.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/87fea16b-33f6-43ec-8056-5ef3565ac4c2/b3af72b1290e903fabf70b25174dde8d754fac78bac86ddc05348f5b1d5088f0.jpg)
Fig. 3.10 Full cost of product procedure

The use of predetermined allocation rates rather than actual allocation rates computed during the year, has three main advantages (Anthony et al. 2011):

(1) first, allocation rates computed during the year (monthly for example) would be affected by conditions peculiar to that period. Variables on which the allocation rates are defined could change during the period by generating a fluctuation of the allocation rate. Consequently, the product cost would be misleading because allocation of the indirect costs is affected by these fluctuations;
(2) second, the predetermined allocation rate allows for allocation of indirect costs of the product in the same time in which the direct costs are attributed;
(3) third, the predetermined allocation rate allows for calculation of the product cost ex-ante in budget and with calculation of the variance during the year on the basis of the actual product costs. In fact, by using the predetermined allocation rates, expected costs and volumes are used and subsequently the product cost is estimated. During the year, the estimated costs are replaced by the actual costs, and then the product cost becomes actual. The difference between estimated product cost and actual cost of product defines the variance. The analysis of the variance is the most relevant activity in order to measure the difference between the estimate and the actual date for decision making during the year.

The most uncertain part of the definition of predetermined allocation rates is estimating whether or not the level of activity will be monthly in the forthcoming year. This amount is called the standard volume. Usually, the monthly standard volume is defined as equal to one-twelfth of the total volume estimated for the forthcoming year (Anthony et al. 2011).

The volume has a relevant value for allocation rates.

The main problem due to the relationship between volume and allocation rate is that the cost per unit of product changes on the basis of the volume estimated. Specifically, there are two main problems:

- first, the cost per unit of product is higher if the volume is estimated lower and it is lower if the volume is estimated higher;
- second, the cost per unit of product includes indirect costs for activities defined even if these activities have not been carried out.

The main problem due to the predetermined allocation rates is that the amount of indirect costs allocated to the product in a given month on the basis of the estimate is likely to differ from the amount of indirect costs allocated to the product on the basis of actual data. It occurs because the indirect costs assigned to the cost centers as well as the actual activity level for the month, are likely to be different from the estimates used when the predetermined allocation rates were calculated.

It generates the two phenomenon called (Anthony et al. 2011):

- under-absorbed of indirect costs: the amount of estimated indirect costs absorbed by the product are less than the amount of actual indirect costs absorbed by product;

over-absorbed of indirect costs: the amount of estimated indirect costs absorbed by product exceeds the amount of actual indirect costs absorbed by the product.

The problem of cross subsidies is strictly connected with these two phenomenon. Generally, if the indirect cost structure is quite complex, use of the allocation rate leads to understatement of some product costs and overstatement of other product costs.

# 3.3 Variance Analysis

The procedure used to calculate the full cost as described previously, gives two types of outputs according to the definition of direct and indirect costs:

- the cost of product as it should be: if direct and indirect costs estimated is used, on the basis of the predetermined allocation rates, it results in the standard cost of product;
- the cost of product as it actually is: if direct and indirect costs actual is used, on the basis of the predetermined allocation rates, it results in the actual cost of product.

The standard costs (and in general the standard values) are the basis of the budget while the actual costs (and in general the actual values) are revealed during the year and they are the real values.

A key role in the standard system is played by the bill of materials: it includes all standards in terms of quantity, time, price and cost to obtain the standard costs and revenues in budget.

In this context, the variance is the simple difference between two numbers: (i) the standard performance; (ii) the actual performance.

Therefore, the variance analysis investigates into the difference between the standard and actual performance. Specifically, a variance analysis involves the decomposition of the variance into the individual factors that have originated the variance. There is no one way of carrying out the variance analysis because many types can be appropriated on the basis of company characteristics, its business and the decision-making process. Generally, a variance analysis must be implemented only if it allows for management to make decisions on the basis of the analysis between the estimated value in budget and actual value revealed.

A general overview of Variance Analysis scheme is summarized in Fig. 3.11 (adaptation from Anthony et al. 2011).

The aim of the variance analysis is to split up the total difference between Actual Net Income and Budget Net Income into the factors that have caused this difference and their specific relevance on total difference.

Based on such analysis management can understand relevant questions about the causes of the variances and take appropriate action based on the answers to these questions. Therefore, the variance analysis is focused on a deep understanding of

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/87fea16b-33f6-43ec-8056-5ef3565ac4c2/799d9eefb3f76cea48fb145cce03bfd616b90e7e1eba7afde13d955fab386320.jpg)
Fig. 3.11 Variance analysis scheme

the causes able to generate differences between budget and actual for the decision-making process at each level of the organization.

The variance analysis must be developed according to two different plans:

- first, is the correct calculation of all variances in order to define the right amount of the variances and further understand fragmentation of the variance between Budget Net Income and Actual Net Income;
- second, is the correct interpretation of these variances in order to make decisions to realign the budget with the actual.

In this sense, the first plan defines "what" the amounts of difference between actual and budget results were, and the second plan is more relevant because it defines "why" these variances occurred.

On the basis of this second plan, at a favourable or unfavourable variance does not imply good or bad performance. It requires the opinion of management according to the defined standard and the actual dynamics and their meaning in the decision-making process and strategies. Also a variance can get out of management control.

Despite the fact that there is no a standard variance analysis (because the depth of analysis and its complexity is function of the company characteristics and management's needs and judgments and it is possible to use different level of techniques) it is possible to identify a basic general rule: the variance analysis has to generate outputs whose relevance to increase company profit is higher than the cost of the analysis.

As shown in Fig. 3.11, the variance between Budget Net Income and Actual Net Income is due to the variance between Budget Operating Income and Actual Operating Income. Indeed, the variance in extraordinary items and taxes are not relevant in terms of decision-making process. The variance in Operating Income can be attributed to variances in three main areas (Anthony et al. 2011):

(a) Production Variances;
(b) Marketing Variances;
(c) General and Administrative Variances.

Before starting the variance analysis, it is important to note that it is not important if the variance is calculated by considering the standard (or budget) minus the actual or reverse. It changes the sign but not its meaning. By considering the cost variances, if:

- the actual cost is lower than the standard cost, it implies a negative cost and therefore the variance is favourable;
- the actual cost is higher than the standard cost, it implies a positive cost and therefore the variance is unfavourable.

Differently, by considering the revenue variances, if:

- the actual revenue is lower than the budget revenue, it implies a negative revenue and therefore the variance is unfavourable;
- the actual revenue is higher than the budget revenue, it implies a positive revenue and therefore the variance is favourable.

Therefore, it is possible to generalize by saying that unfavourable variance makes Actual Net Income lower than Budget Net Income. It occurs when:

- actual revenue is less than budget revenue;
- actual cost is higher than budget cost.

Differently, favourable variance makes Actual Net Income higher than Budget Net Income. It occurs when:

- actual revenue is higher than budget revenue;
- actual cost is less than budget cost.

Finally, note that words "standard" and "budget" refer both to the estimated data and therefore what costs and revenues should be. Usually, standard is used with per-unit cost and revenue amounts, while budget is used with total amounts of revenues and costs.

# (a) Production Cost Variances

The production cost variances involve the analysis of the variance with regards to direct costs (direct material and direct labour) and indirect costs. Therefore, there are three main components (Anthony et al. 2011):

# 3.3 Variance Analysis

- Direct Material Costs;
- Direct Labour Costs;
- Indirect Production Costs.

# Direct Material Variances

The standard direct material cost per unit of product (or one unit of output)  $(\mathrm{MC}_{\mathrm{U}(\mathrm{S})})$  is equal to the standard quantity of material per unit of product  $(\mathrm{QM}_{\mathrm{U}(\mathrm{S})})$  multiplied by the standard cost (or price) of material per unit of product  $(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{U}(\mathrm{S})})$  (Anthony et al. 2011).

The total standard direct material cost  $(\mathrm{MC}_{\mathrm{T(S)}})$  for an accounting period is equal to the standard direct material cost per unit of product  $(\mathrm{MC}_{\mathrm{U(S)}})$  multiplied by the number of units of product (or output) produced actually  $(Q_{(A)})$  and then effectively in that period (Anthony et al. 2011).

Formally:

$$
M C _ {U (S)} = Q M _ {U (S)} \cdot C _ {U (S)} \Rightarrow M C _ {T (S)} = M C _ {U (S)} \cdot Q _ {(A)} \tag {3.20}
$$

Similarly, actual direct material cost per unit of product (or one unit of output)  $(\mathbf{MC}_{\mathrm{U(A)}})$  is equal to the actual quantity of material per unit of product  $(\mathbf{QM}_{\mathrm{U(A)}})$  multiplied by the actual cost of material per unit of product  $(\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{U(A)}})$ .

The total actual direct material cost  $(\mathrm{MC}_{\mathrm{T(A)}})$  for an accounting period is equal to the actual direct material cost per unit of product  $(\mathrm{MC}_{\mathrm{U(A)}})$  multiplied by the number of units of product currently produced  $(Q_{\mathrm{(A)}})$ , and then effectively, in that period (Anthony et al. 2011).

Formally:

$$
M C _ {U (A)} = Q M _ {U (A)} \cdot C _ {U (A)} \Rightarrow M C _ {T (A)} = M C _ {U (A)} \cdot Q _ {(A)} \tag {3.21}
$$

The direct material cost variance (DMV) is equal to the difference between total standard direct material cost  $(\mathrm{MC}_{\mathrm{T(S)}})$  and the total actual direct material cost  $(\mathrm{MC}_{\mathrm{T(A)}})$  for an accounting period.

Since the number of units of product currently produced  $(\mathrm{Q}_{(\mathrm{A})})$  is the same in both cases, standard and actual, the difference is due to the standard quantity of material per unit of product  $(\mathrm{QM}_{\mathrm{U}(\mathrm{S})})$  and the current direct material cost per unit of product  $(\mathrm{MC}_{\mathrm{U}(\mathrm{A})})$  (Anthony et al. 2011).

Formally:

$$
D M V = M C _ {T (S)} - M C _ {T (A)} \Rightarrow D M V = \left[ M C _ {U (S)} - M C _ {U (A)} \right] \cdot Q _ {(A)} \tag {3.22}
$$

Therefore, direct material cost variance is based on the actual quantity of a period (and therefore standard quantity in the budget is not relevant in the analysis) and it is function of the difference between the standard direct material cost per unit of product and the actual direct material cost per unit of product.

The direct material cost variance (DMV) can be divided up into two components (Anthony et al. 2011):

(1) Material usage variance (also called yield variance or simply quantity component)  $(\mathrm{DMV}_{(\mathrm{Q})})$ : it is equal to the difference between total standard quantity of material  $(\mathrm{QM}_{\mathrm{T(S)}})$  and total current quantity of material  $(\mathrm{QM}_{\mathrm{T(A)}})$ , with each total quantity priced at the standard cost (or price) of material per unit of product  $(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{U(S)}})$ .

Both total quantities are based on the number of units of product actually  $(\mathrm{Q}_{(\mathrm{A})})$  produced. Therefore, total standard quantity of material  $(\mathrm{QM}_{\mathrm{T}(\mathrm{S})})$  is equal to the standard quantity of material per unit of product  $(\mathrm{QM}_{\mathrm{U}(\mathrm{S})})$  multiplied by the number of units of product actually  $(\mathrm{Q}_{(\mathrm{A})})$ , and the total actual quantity of material  $(\mathrm{QM}_{\mathrm{T}(\mathrm{A})})$  is equal to the actual quantity of material per unit of product  $(\mathrm{QM}_{\mathrm{U}(\mathrm{A})})$  multiplied by the number of units of current product  $(\mathrm{Q}_{(\mathrm{A})})$ . Formally:

$$
\begin{array}{l} Q M _ {T (S)} = Q M _ {U (S)} \cdot Q _ {(A)} \\ Q M _ {T (A)} = Q M _ {U (A)} \cdot Q _ {(A)} \end{array} \Rightarrow Q M _ {T (S)} - Q M _ {T (A)} = \left[ Q M _ {U (S)} - Q M _ {U (A)} \right] \cdot Q _ {(A)} \tag {3.23}
$$

and therefore:

$$
D M V _ {(Q)} = \left[ Q M _ {T (S)} \cdot C _ {U (S)} - Q M _ {T (A)} \cdot C _ {U (S)} \right] = \left[ Q M _ {T (S)} - Q M _ {T (A)} \right] \cdot C _ {U (S)} \tag {3.24}
$$

or in equivalent terms:

$$
D M V _ {(Q)} = \Delta Q M _ {T (S - A)} \cdot C _ {U (S)} \tag {3.25}
$$

Equation (3.25) shows how the material usage variance is equal to delta  $(\Delta)$  between standard and actual quantity of material multiplied by standard material costs:

$$
D M V _ {(Q)} = \Delta \text {Q u a n t i t y} \cdot \text {S t a n d a r d C o s t}
$$

(2) Material cost variance (also called material price variance or price component)  $(\mathrm{DMV}_{(\mathbf{C})})$ : it is equal to the difference between standard cost (or price) of material per unit of product  $(\mathrm{C_{U(S)}})$  and the actual cost (or price) of material per unit of product  $(\mathrm{C_{U(A)}})$  multiplied by the total actual quantity of material  $(\mathrm{QM}_{\mathrm{T(A)}})$  used. Therefore, the material cost variance is equal to delta  $(\Delta)$

# 3.3 Variance Analysis

between standard and actual cost of material per unit of product multiplied by actual quantity of material:

$$
D M V _ {(C)} = \Delta C o s t \cdot A c t u a l Q u a n t i t y
$$

Formally:

$$
D M V _ {(C)} = \left[ C _ {U (S)} - C _ {U (A)} \right] \cdot Q M _ {T (A)} \leftrightarrow D M V _ {(P)} = \Delta C _ {U (S - A)} \cdot Q M _ {T (A)} \tag {3.26}
$$

The distinction of Direct Material Variances in its two components, Material Usage Variance and Material Price Variance, is fundamental for the management analysis for planning and control.

# Direct Labour Variances

The standard direct labour cost per unit of product (or output)  $(\mathrm{LC}_{\mathrm{UP(S)}})$  is equal to the standard labour time per unit of product (or outputs)  $(\mathrm{LT}_{\mathrm{UP(S)}})$  usually expressed in hours, multiplied by a standard labour cost (or standard rate) per unit of time  $(\mathrm{LC}_{\mathrm{UT(S)}})$ .

Note that if workers are paid on a price-rate basis, the standard labour cost per unit of product is the rates for producing that unit.

Total standard direct labour cost  $(\mathrm{LC}_{\mathrm{T(S)}})$  of an accounting period is equal to the standard direct labour cost per unit of product (or output)  $(\mathrm{LC}_{\mathrm{UP(S)}})$  multiplied by the number of units of product (or output) produced actually  $(Q_{(A)})$  and then effectively in that period (Anthony et al. 2011).

Formally:

$$
L C _ {U P (S)} = L T _ {U P (S)} \cdot L C _ {U T (S)} \Rightarrow L C _ {T (S)} = L C _ {U P (S)} \cdot Q _ {(A)} \tag {3.27}
$$

Similarly, actual direct labour cost per unit of product (or unit of output)  $\mathrm{(LC_{UP(A)})}$  is equal to the actual labour time per unit of product (or output)  $\mathrm{(LT_{UP(A)})}$  multiplied by actual labour cost (or standard rate) per unit of time  $\mathrm{(LC_{UT(A)})}$ .

The total actual direct labour cost  $(\mathrm{LC}_{\mathrm{T(A)}})$  for an accounting period is equal to the actual direct labour cost per unit of product (or output)  $(\mathrm{LC}_{\mathrm{UP(A)}})$  multiplied by the number of units of product (or output) produced actually  $(\mathrm{Q_{(A)}})$  and then effectively in that period (Anthony et al. 2011).

Formally:

$$
L C _ {U P (A)} = L T _ {U P (A)} \cdot L C _ {U T (A)} \Rightarrow L C _ {T (A)} = L C _ {U P (A)} \cdot Q _ {(A)} \tag {3.28}
$$

The direct labour cost variance (DLV) is equal to the difference between total standard direct labour cost  $(\mathrm{LC}_{\mathrm{T(S)}})$  and the total actual direct labour cost  $(\mathrm{LC}_{\mathrm{UP(A)}})$  for an accounting period. Since the number of units of product (or output) produced

actually  $(\mathrm{Q}_{(\mathrm{A})})$  is the same in both cases, standard and actual, the difference is due to the standard direct labour cost per unit of product (or output)  $(\mathrm{LC}_{\mathrm{UP}(\mathrm{S})})$  and the actual labour time per unit of product (or output)  $(\mathrm{LT}_{\mathrm{UP}(\mathrm{A})})$ . Formally:

$$
D L V = L C _ {T (S)} - L C _ {U P (A)} \Rightarrow D L V = \left[ L C _ {U P (S)} - L C _ {U P (A)} \right] \cdot Q _ {(A)} \tag {3.29}
$$

Therefore, direct labour cost variance is based on the actual quantity of a period (and therefore standard quantity in the budget is not relevant in the analysis) and it is function of the difference between the standard direct labour cost per unit of product (or output) and the actual direct labour cost per unit of product.

The direct labour cost variance (DLV) can be divided up into two components (Anthony et al. 2011):

(1) Labour efficiency labour (also called the quantity variance or the usage variance)  $(\mathrm{DLV}_{(\mathbb{Q})})$ : it is equal to the difference between standard labour time per unit of product (or outputs)  $(\mathrm{LT}_{\mathrm{UP}(\mathrm{S})})$  and actual labour time per unit of product (or output)  $(\mathrm{LT}_{\mathrm{UP}(\mathrm{A})})$  multiplied by standard labour cost (or standard rate) per unit of time  $(\mathrm{LC}_{\mathrm{UT}(\mathrm{S})})$ . Therefore, the labour efficiency variance is equal to delta  $(\Delta)$  between standard and actual of labour time per unit of product multiplied by standard labour cost per unit of time:

$$
D L V _ {(Q)} = \Delta \text {T i m e} \cdot \text {S t a n c a r d C o s t}
$$

Formally:

$$
D L V _ {(Q)} = \left[ L T _ {U P (S)} - L T _ {U P (A)} \right] \cdot L C _ {U T (S)} \leftrightarrow D L V _ {(Q)} = \Delta L T _ {U P (S - A)} \cdot L C _ {U T (S)} \tag {3.30}
$$

(2) Labour cost variance (also called labour rate variance or labour price variance)  $(\mathrm{DLV}_{(\mathrm{C})})$ : it is equal to the difference between standard labour cost (or standard rate) per unit of time  $(\mathrm{LC}_{\mathrm{UT}(\mathrm{S})})$  and actual labour cost (or standard rate) per unit of time  $(\mathrm{LC}_{\mathrm{UT}(\mathrm{A})})$  multiplied by the actual labour time per unit of product (or output)  $(\mathrm{LT}_{\mathrm{UP}(\mathrm{A})})$ . Therefore, the labour cost variance is equal to delta  $(\Delta)$  between standard and actual of labour cost per unit of product multiplied by actual labour time per unit of product:

$$
D L V _ {(C)} = \Delta C o s t \cdot A c t u a l T i m e
$$

Formally:

$$
\begin{array}{l} D L V _ {(Q)} = \left[ L C _ {U T (S)} - L C _ {U T (A)} \right] \cdot L T _ {U P (A)} \leftrightarrow D L V _ {(Q)} \tag {3.31} \\ = \Delta L C _ {U T (S - A)} \cdot L T _ {U P (A)} \\ \end{array}
$$

# 3.3 Variance Analysis

# Indirect Production Cost Variances

Indirect Production Costs are allocated to the product through predetermined allocation rates. These rates are calculated by dividing the estimated product activity level (normal or standard volume) by the estimated total indirect costs to be incurred at that volume (Anthony et al. 2011).

By distinguishing between variable indirect costs and fixed indirect costs, total indirect costs  $(\mathrm{IC_T})$  are equal to total fixed indirect costs per period  $(\mathrm{IFC_T})$  plus variable indirect cost per unit of product  $(\mathrm{IVC_U})$  multiplied by quantity of product in volume (Q), so we have:

$$
I C _ {T} = I F C _ {T} + \left(I V C _ {U} \cdot Q\right) \tag {3.31}
$$

Equation (3.31) represents the flexible budget straight line. It illustrates the amount of costs expected for each level of volume. Since some indirect production costs are variable, others are fixed and still others are semi-variable, total indirect production costs will be different at each volume level. Therefore, within an estimated volume range, total budget indirect production costs are expected to vary according to the equation, as shown in Fig. 3.12 (adaptation from Anthony et al. 2011).

The allocation rate  $(AR)$  defines the average indirect cost per unit of product at the standard quantity volume  $(Q_{S})$ . Therefore, it is found by dividing the total indirect costs at the standard volume by the standard volume and therefore the number of units represented by that volume number of units, as follows:

$$
A R = \frac {I C _ {T}}{Q _ {S}} = \frac {I F C _ {T} + (I V C _ {U} \cdot Q _ {S})}{Q _ {S}} = \frac {I F C _ {T}}{Q _ {S}} + \frac {I V C _ {U} \cdot Q _ {S}}{Q _ {S}} = \frac {I F C _ {T}}{Q _ {S}} + I V C _ {U} \tag {3.32}
$$

Therefore, the allocation rate  $(AR)$  is equal to the sum of the variable indirect cost per unit  $(ICVU)$  and the average fixed indirect costs per unit at standard volume  $\left(\frac{ICF}{Q_s}\right)$ . Figure 3.13 (adaptation from Anthony et al. 2011) illustrates the absorbed cost at standard volume by considering the predetermined allocation rate.

The Indirect Production Cost Variance (ICV) is the difference between actual indirect production costs and indirect production costs absorbed by production (and therefore allocated to products).

The Indirect Cost Variance can be divided up into two parts (Anthony et al. 2011):

(1) Production Volume Variance (PVV): it is due to the difference between standard volume of production in terms of units used in calculating the predetermined allocation rate and actual volume of production in terms of units.

Indirect production costs are allocated to each unit product produced, through the predetermined allocation rate. Therefore, each unit product absorbs a share-part of indirect production costs.

Fig. 3.12 Flexible budget

The amount of total indirect costs absorbed (AIC) by the units produced is equal to the predetermined allocation rate (AR) multiplied by the actual volume (in terms of number of units) produced  $(\mathrm{Q}_{(\mathrm{A})})$ :

$$
A I C = A R \cdot Q _ {(A)} \tag {3.33}
$$

It is important to note that budget indirect costs and absorbed indirect costs will only be equal at the standard volume  $(Q_{(S)})$  in terms of number of units. Therefore (Anthony et al. 2011):

- actual volume is equal to standard volume  $(Q_{(A)} = Q_{(S)})$ : the amount of indirect production costs absorbed is equal to the budgeted indirect production costs;
- at any actual volume below standard volume  $(Q_{(A)} < Q_{(S)})$ : the amount of indirect production costs absorbed is less than the budgeted indirect production costs at that volume. At these volumes, budgeted indirect costs are under-absorbed (or unabsorbed). It produces unfavourable variance;
- at any actual volume above standard volume  $(Q_{(A)} > Q_{(S)})$ : the amount of indirect production costs absorbed is more than the budgeted indirect production costs at that volume. At these volumes, budgeted indirect costs are overabsorbed. It produces a favourable variance.

Therefore, under-absorbed and over-absorbed are functions of the difference between budgeted and absorbed costs caused solely by the fact that actual volume is

Fig. 3.13 Allocation rate

different from standard volume on the basis of the predetermined allocation rate calculated. For this reason, it is defined as production volume variance.

It is important to know that, the standard volume used in calculating the predetermined allocation rate is the volume expected during the forthcoming year (Anthony et al. 2011).

(2) Spending Variance (SV): is due to difference between the standard total indirect production costs in budget and the actual total indirect production costs achieved. Specifically, the spending variance is equal to the difference between the budgeted indirect production costs for the period's actual level of volume less the period's actual indirect costs. If:

- the actual indirect production costs are below the budgeted indirect production costs, the variance is favourable;
- the actual indirect production costs are above the budgeted indirect production costs, the variance is unfavourable.

Since the spending variance is based on the amount of indirect production costs estimated for the actual level of volume in the period, it implies that the spending variance is due to the difference between standard volume and actual volume.

It is worth noting that the spending variance for indirect production costs has the same meaning as the sum of usage and price (cost) variances for direct material cost and direct labour cost. Therefore, the spending variance can be divided up for each item cost between usage variance and price variance as described for direct cost variances (Anthony et al. 2011).

The Indirect Production Cost Variance (ICV) can be summarized as in Fig. 3.14 (adaptation from Anthony et al. 2011).

Therefore, the Indirect Production Cost Variance (ICV) is equal to the sum of Production Volume Variance (PVV) and Spending Variance (SV). Specifically, there are three main relationships (Anthony et al. 2011):

(a) Indirect Production Cost Variance (ICV): it is equal to absorbed costs less actual costs;
(b) Production Volume Variance (PVV): it is equal to absorbed costs less budgeted costs. It is always borne in mind that both the absorbed and budgeted cost amounts are based on the actual production volume of the period. Note that the production volume variance is also equal to the fixed portion of the allocation rate multiplied by the difference between actual volume and standard volume.
(c) Spending Variance (SV): it is equal to budgeted costs less actual costs.

# (b) Marketing Variances

Usually, the marketing department focuses on two main goals: the gross margin to be achieved and the expenses limit in its budget to be respected. Based on these two goals, the marketing variance can be divided up into two parts: (i) Expenses Variances and (ii) Gross Margin Variances (Anthony et al. 2011).

Expenses Variances (EV) refers to each item of marketing expense and is equal to the difference between Actual Expenses (or Cost)  $(\mathrm{E}_{(\mathrm{A})})$  and Budget Expense (or Cost)  $(\mathrm{E}_{(\mathrm{B})})$ :

$$
E V = E _ {(A)} - E _ {(B)} \tag {3.34}
$$

Gross Margin Variances (GMV) refers to the difference between Actual Gross Margin  $(\mathrm{GMV}_{(\mathrm{A})})$  and Budget Gross Margin  $(\mathrm{GMV}_{(\mathrm{B})})$  both calculated on the basis of the standard cost per unit of product:

$$
G M V = G M V _ {(A)} - G M V _ {(B)} \tag {3.35}
$$

The Gross Margin is equal to the difference between sales revenues (equal to the sum of the multiplications for each type of product of the price per unit of product and the volume in terms of units of product) and cost of sales (equal to the sum of the multiplications for each type of product of the cost per unit of product and the volume in terms of units of product) defines the Gross Margin. Generally, the marketing department is responsible for product sales volume and unit selling prices but not for the cost per unit of product. Therefore, in order to calculate the gross margin variance the cost per unit of product used should be the standard cost. The variance between the actual and standard cost per unit of product is calculated in production variance (Anthony et al. 2011).

The Gross Margin Variance can be divided up into three main components (Anthony et al. 2011):

Fig. 3.14 Indirect production cost variance: budgeted, absorbed and actual indirect production costs

- Unit Margin Variance;
Sales Volume Variance;
- Product Mix Variance.

# Unit Margin Variance

It is due to the difference between budget gross margin per unit of product and actual gross margin per unit of product. Specifically, the Unit Margin Variance  $(UMV)$  is equal to the difference between actual unit margin  $(MU_{(A)})$  and budget unit margin  $(MU_{(B)})$  multiplied by actual volume  $(Q_{(A)})$ :

$$
U M V = \left(M U _ {(A)} - M U _ {(B)}\right) \cdot Q _ {(A)} \leftrightarrow M U V = \Delta M U _ {(A - B)} \cdot Q _ {(A)} \tag {3.36}
$$

It is worth noting that unit margin variance can be also called the selling price variance if it is assumed that the actual unit cost turns out to be equal to the budget standard unit cost during the period (Anthony et al. 2011). Indeed, the unit margin variance  $(UMV)$  is equal to the difference between the actual unit margin  $(MU_{(A)})$  and budget unit margin  $(MU_{(B)})$ . The actual unit margin  $(MU_{(A)})$  is equal to the difference between actual unit selling price  $(UP_{(A)})$  and actual unit cost  $(UC_{(A)})$  as well as the budget unit margin  $(MU_{(B)})$  is equal to the difference between budget

unit selling price  $(UP_{(B)})$  and budget standard unit cost  $(UC_{(B)})$ . Substituting, we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} U M V = M U _ {(A)} - M U _ {(B)} \rightarrow\begin{array}{l}M U _ {(A)} = U P _ {(A)} - U C _ {(A)}\\M U _ {(B)} = U P _ {(B)} - U C _ {(B)}\end{array}\rightarrow U M V \tag {3.37} \\ = \left(U P _ {(A)} - U C _ {(A)}\right) - \left(U P _ {(B)} - U C _ {(B)}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

If it is assumed that actual unit cost  $(UC_{(A)})$  it is equal to the budget standard unit cost  $(UC_{(B)})$  during the period, we have:

$$
U C _ {(A)} = U C _ {(B)} \rightarrow U M V = U P _ {(A)} - U P _ {(B)} \tag {3.38}
$$

Therefore, in this case the unit margin variance  $(UMV)$  is caused solely by the difference between actual unit selling price  $(UP_{(A)})$  and budget unit selling price  $(UP_{(B)})$ .

Consequently, if the company uses the same standard unit costs during the year as were used in preparing that year's budget, the unit margin variance is called selling price variance because it is due to the difference between actual and budget selling unit price.

# Sales Volume Variance

It is due to the difference between budget sales volume (in units of product) and actual sales volume (in units of product). Specifically, the sales volume variance  $(SVV)$  is equal to the difference between actual volume  $(Q_{(A)})$  and budget volume  $(Q_{(B)})$  multiplied by budget unit margin  $(MU_{(B)})$ :

$$
S V V = \left(Q _ {(A)} - Q _ {(B)}\right) \cdot M U _ {(B)} \leftrightarrow M U V = \Delta Q _ {(A - B)} \cdot M U _ {(B)} \tag {3.38}
$$

If data is available on total sales of a product by all companies, the volume variance can be divided up into industry volume variance and markets share variance (Anthony et al. 2011). This division is useful because it is possible to distinguish the variance due to changes in total industry sales, that reflect the general economic conditions and therefore they are out of management control, and the variance due to changes in company's market share that are attributable to management strategies.

Specifically, industry volume variance  $(IVV)$  is equal to the difference between actual industry volume  $(IV_{(A)})$  and budget industry volume  $(IV_{(B)})$  multiplied by budget market share  $(MS_{(B)})$  and budget unit margin  $(MU_{(B)})$ :

$$
I V V = \left(I V _ {(A)} - I V _ {(B)}\right) \cdot M S _ {(B)} \cdot M U _ {(B)} \rightarrow I V V = \Delta I V _ {(A - B)} \cdot M S _ {(B)} \cdot M U _ {(B)} \tag {3.39}
$$

# 3.3 Variance Analysis

Market share variance  $(MSV)$  is equal to the difference between actual market share  $(MS_{(A)})$  and budget market share  $(MS_{(B)})$  multiplied by actual industry volume  $(IV_{(A)})$  and budget unit margin  $(MU_{(B)})$ :

$$
M S V = \left(M S _ {(A)} - M S _ {(B)}\right) \cdot I V _ {(A)} \cdot M U _ {(B)} \rightarrow M S V = \Delta M S _ {(A - B)} \cdot I V _ {(A)} \cdot M U _ {(B)} \tag {3.40}
$$

# Product Mix Variance

It highlights if the company sells several products with different unit gross margins. If the company sells several products with different unit gross margins, the mix of high-margin and low-margin products have relevant effects on total gross margin.

Therefore, the product mix variance measures the variance in gross margin due to the difference between the budget mix that indicates the mix of products estimated to sell, and the actual mix that indicated the mix of products truly sold (Anthony et al. 2011).

The mix variance is the sum of the mix variances attributable to each product calculated on the difference between the Actual Volume (in units of product) Sold and Budget Volume (in units of product) Expected to Sell.

Note the difference use of volume for the calculation of production variances and marketing variances (Anthony et al. 2011):

- the analysis of marketing variances is based on sales volume and the difference between actual sales volume and budget sales volume. Indeed, the actual net income is based on actual sales volume as well as the budget net income is based on budget sales volume;
- the analysis of production variances is based on production volume and not on sales volumes. Also, the difference between actual and standard (in budget) production volume is relevant only with regards to indirect product costs volume variance. Indeed, in direct material and direct labour costs variances, the budget production volume is always irrelevant.

# (c) General and Administrative Costs Variances

The general and administrative expenses (or Costs) include all others administrative costs, financial costs, non-operating costs and taxes.

For each item of cost, its variance may be divided up into volume and price. However, the variance for each cost is normally calculated as a simple difference between the actual cost and budget cost (Anthony et al. 2011). Therefore, the cost variance  $(CV)$  for each cost is equal to the difference between its actual cost  $(C_{(A)})$  and its budget cost  $(C_{(B)})$  as follows:

$$
C V = C _ {(A)} - C _ {(B)} \tag {3.41}
$$
