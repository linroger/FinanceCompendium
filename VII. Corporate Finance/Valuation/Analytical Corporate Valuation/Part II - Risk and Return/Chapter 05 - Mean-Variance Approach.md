Abstract The mean-variance approach is the most widely used in the portfolio selections. The portfolio selection is based on two variables: (i) expected value of the portfolio return; (ii) variance of the expected portfolio return measuring the portfolio risk. An efficient portfolio must satisfy the Pareto optimal condition. Therefore, the investor prefers the portfolio that is capable of maximising its expected return to an equal variance or the portfolio capable of minimizing its variance to an equal expected return. This approach simplifies the problem of portfolio selection. There are two main advantages: first, it does not require specification about probability distribution; second, it is simple and intuitive because it is only based on the mean and variance. However, it is also true that this approach neglects a lot of relevant information about distribution probability. The entire portfolio selection process can be simplified on the basis of two main phases of the portfolio selection process:

(1) optimization phase: the aim is to define the diversified portfolio and the efficient frontier. The definition of the diversified portfolio is based on the statistical characteristics of the assets. Specifically, the expected return of the portfolio is equal to the weighted average of the expected returns of the assets, while the portfolio variance is the function of the covariance between the assets' expected returns. The assumption refers to the investors' homogeneous expectations about the statistical characteristics of the assets implying that all investors define the same efficient frontier.
(2) maximization phase: the aim is to choose the optimal portfolio among the efficient portfolios defined on the efficient frontier. None of the efficient portfolios on the efficient frontiers can be preferred over the others by definition. The choice of the optimal portfolio among the efficient portfolios requires a clear definition of the investor's preferences about risk.

While the optimization phase is characterized by objectivity because it is valid for the entire market and not for the single investor, the maximization phase is characterized by subjectivity because it is the function of the investor's risk preferences. An analysis of the entire portfolio selection process based on the optimization and maximization phases can be carried out according to four main steps:

- (step 1) construction of the diversified portfolio;
- (step 2) construction of the efficient frontier;
- (step 3) definition of the efficient portfolios;
- (step 4) choice of the optimal portfolio.

The first three steps (1, 2, 3) define the optimization phase while the last step (4) defines the maximization phase.

# 5.1 Diversified Portfolio

The mean-variance approach is the most widely used in the portfolio selections (Markowitz 1952, 1956, 1959, 1976, 2014, 2016; Tobin 1958). The portfolio selection is based on two variables:

(1) expected value of the portfolio return  $(\mu_P)$ ;
(2) variance of the expected portfolio returns  $(\sigma_P^2)$  measuring the portfolio's risk.

The efficient portfolio must satisfy the Pareto optimal condition: it is impossible to improve one objective without worsening the other. Therefore, the investor prefers the portfolio that is capable of maximising its expected return to an equal variance or the portfolio capable of minimising its variance to an equal expected return. Therefore, the portfolio is efficient only if:

- for a given level of expected return, it minimizes the variance (and therefore the portfolio risk);
- for a given level of variance, it maximizes the portfolio expected return.

By considering a portfolio  $(A)$  with mean  $\mu_{A}$  and variance  $\sigma_A^2$  and a portfolio  $(B)$  with mean  $\mu_B$  and variance  $\sigma_B^2$ , the portfolio  $(A)$  dominates (it is strictly preferred) the portfolio  $(B)$  if one of the following two conditions is achieved:

$$
\mathrm {A} \succ \mathrm {B} \quad \text {i f} \left\{ \begin{array}{c} \mu_ {\mathrm {A}} > \mu_ {\mathrm {B}}; \quad \sigma_ {\mathrm {A}} ^ {2} \leq \sigma_ {\mathrm {B}} ^ {2} \\ \text {o r} \\ \sigma_ {\mathrm {A}} ^ {2} <   \sigma_ {\mathrm {B}} ^ {2}; \quad \mu_ {\mathrm {A}} \geq \mu_ {\mathrm {B}} \end{array} \right.
$$

This approach simplifies the problem of portfolio selection. There are two main advantages: first, it does not require specification about probability distribution; second, it is simple and intuitive because it is only based on the mean and variance. However, it is also true that this approach neglects a lot of relevant information about the probability distribution.

The portfolio selection in the mean-variance approach can be considered solely as a problem of definition of the weights to be assigned to each asset in the portfolio. Indeed, the statistical characteristics of each asset, with regards to the first and second order (mean, variance, and covariance) are known.

Similarly to the utility function approach, also in this case there are two main phases of the portfolio selection process (among the others: Elton et al. 2013; Elton and Gruber 1977; Ledoit and Wolf 2003; Epps 1981; Jennings 1971; Johnson and Shannon 1974; Rubinstein 1973; Statman 1987; Wagner and Lau 1971; Cesari 2012a, b; Castellani et al. 2005; Brennan and Kraus 1976; Brown and Barry 1985; Brumelle 1974; Latane et al. 1971; Meyers 1973; Canner 1997; Cass and Stiglitz 1970; Dalal 1983; Edwards and Goetzmann 1994; Robichek and Cohn 1974; Elton and Gruber 1971, 1974; Hakansson 1970; Merton 1972; Mossin 1968; Ohlson 1975; Pye 1973; Smith 1968; Sunder 1980; Sharpe 1971; Schafer et al. 1976; Russ and Rosenberg 1980; Pogue and Solnik 1974; Officer 1973; Martin and Klemkosky 1975; Kryzanowski and To 1983; Fama 1968, 1981; Fama and MacBeth 1973; Farrell 1974; Francis 1975):

(1) optimization phase: the aim is to define the diversified portfolio and the efficient frontier.

The definition of the diversified portfolio is based on the statistical characteristics of the assets. Specifically, the portfolio expected return is equal to the weighted average of the expected returns of the assets, while the portfolio variance is the function of the covariance between the assets' expected returns.

The definition of the efficient frontier is based on two main steps. The first step requires consideration of the  $N$  risky assets in the portfolio. In this case, the efficient frontier is characterized by a hyperbolic form. The second step requires consideration of the  $N$  risky assets and one risk-free asset in the portfolio. In this case, the efficient frontier is characterized by a linear form. Specifically, it is a straight line born on the level of risk-free rate on ordinate and it is tangent to the curve.

The assumption refers to the investors' homogeneous expectations about the statistical characteristics of the assets implying that all investors define the same efficient frontier, both hyperbolic and linear.

(2) maximization phase: the aim is to choose the optimal portfolio among the efficient portfolios defined on the efficient frontier. None of the efficient portfolios on efficient frontier can be preferred over all of the others by definition. The choice of the optimal portfolio among the efficient portfolios requires the clear definition of the investor's preferences about risk. Therefore, in the maximization phase a key role is played by the investor's preferences mainly regarding risk. In this context, the utility function can be used to choose the optimal portfolio among the efficient portfolios defined on the basis of the efficient frontier.

It is worth noting that while the optimization phase is characterized by objectivity, because it is valid for the entire market and not for the single investor, the maximization phase is characterized by subjectivity, because it is the function of the investor's preferences about risk.

Based on these two phases, the portfolio selection process can be divided up into four main steps (Cesari 2012b):

- (step 1) construction of the diversified portfolio;
- (step 2) construction of the efficient frontier;
- (step 3) definition of the efficient portfolios;
- (step 4) choice of the optimal portfolio.

While the first three steps (n. 1, 2, 3) define the optimization phase, the last step (n. 4) defines the maximization phase.

Note that in this context "asset" is considered stock, bond or another portfolio.

This paragraph focuses on the construction of the diversified portfolio (step 1), while the other three paragraphs are focused respectively on the construction of the efficient frontier (step 2), definition of the efficient portfolios (step 3) and choice of the optimal portfolio (step 4).

Therefore, the first step of the process is the construction of the diversified portfolio. It requires the definition of:

(a) portfolio expected return
(b) portfolio variance.

# Portfolio Expected Return

The problem of the estimate of the portfolio expected return has a simple solution. Indeed, the portfolio expected return is equal to the weighted average of the expected return of its assets. The weight of the assets is equal to the part of wealth invested in it.

Assuming a portfolio of two assets denoted as Asset 1 and Asset 2 and assuming that the wealth invested in the portfolio is equal to  $w$  and that the weights of the two assets are  $\alpha_{1}$  and  $\alpha_{2}$  respectively, the result is:

$$
w _ {1} + w _ {2} = w \rightarrow \alpha_ {1} = \frac {w _ {1}}{w}; \quad \alpha_ {2} = \frac {w _ {2}}{w} \rightarrow \alpha_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} = 1 \tag {5.1}
$$

Assuming that the expected return of the two assets in the state of nature  $s$  are equal to  $R_{1,s}$  for Asset 1 and  $R_{2,s}$  for the Asset 2, the expected return of the portfolio  $(y_s)$  can be defined as follows (Saltari 2011):

$$
\mathbf {y} _ {\mathrm {s}} = \mathrm {w} \left(\alpha_ {1} \mathrm {R} _ {1, \mathrm {s}} + \alpha_ {2} \mathrm {R} _ {2, \mathrm {s}}\right) \tag {5.2}
$$

In Eq. (5.2) the weights assigned to the two assets  $(\alpha_{1};\alpha_{2})$  are the only unknown variables. The choice of the couple  $(\alpha_{1};\alpha_{2})$  allows for definition of the optimal portfolio.

In order to simplify, assuming that the wealth invested in the portfolio is equal to  $1$  ( $w = 1$ ), Eq. (5.2) can be re-written as follows (Saltari 2011):

$$
\mathrm {E} \left(\mathrm {y} _ {\mathrm {s}}\right) = \alpha_ {1} \mathrm {E} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {1, \mathrm {s}}\right) + \alpha_ {2} \mathrm {E} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {2, \mathrm {s}}\right)
$$

# 5.1 Diversified Portfolio

and by considering that  $\operatorname{E}(.)\equiv \mu (.)$  , we have:

$$
\mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \alpha_ {1} \mu_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} \mu_ {2} \tag {5.3}
$$

Equation (5.3) shows that the portfolio expected return  $(\mu_P)$  is equal to the linear combination of the expected returns of the two assets  $(\mu_1; \mu_2)$  weighted on the basis of their weights  $(\alpha_1; \alpha_2)$  in the portfolio.

To further understand the relevance of Eq. (5.3) is possible to define the problem on the basis of the following two conditions:

(1) definition of the constraint in terms of  $\alpha$  and  $(1 - \alpha)$  and defining the wealth invested in the Asset 2  $(\alpha_{2})$  equal to  $\alpha$  (so that  $\alpha_{2} = \alpha$ ) and the part of wealth invested in the Asset 1  $(\alpha_{1})$  equal to  $(1 - \alpha)$  (so that  $\alpha_{1} = 1 - \alpha$ );
(2) assuming that Asset 2 is riskier than Asset 1, on the basis of the direct relationship between risk and return (the higher risk, the higher return), the variance and mean of the Asset 2 are greater than Asset 1.

These due conditions can be formalized as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \alpha + (1 - \alpha) = 1 \rightarrow \left\{\begin{array}{l l}\alpha_ {2} = \alpha\\\alpha_ {1} = 1 - \alpha\end{array}\quad 0 <   \alpha <   1 \right. \tag {5.4} \\ \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} > \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} (\sigma_ {2} > \sigma_ {1}) \leftrightarrow \mu_ {2} > \mu_ {1} \\ \end{array}
$$

On the basis of the conditions (5.4), Eq. (5.3) can be re-written as follows:

$$
\mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \mu_ {1} + \alpha \left(\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}\right) \tag {5.5}
$$

Equation (5.5) shows three main results:

(1) the relationship between the portfolio expected return  $(\mu_{\mathrm{P}})$  and the assets' expected returns  $(\mu_{1};\mu_{2})$  is linear;
(2) the slope of the straight line  $(\mu_{2} - \mu_{1})$  is always positive because Asset 2 is riskier than Asset 1 and therefore  $\mu_{2} > \mu_{1}$ . The distance between the expected returns of the two assets  $(\mu_{2}; \mu_{1})$  is a constant because the statistical characteristics of the two assets are known;
(3) the portfolio expected return  $(\mu_P)$  is the function of the wealth invested in the riskier asset (Asset 2)  $(\alpha)$ ; consequently, the higher the wealth invested in Asset 2, the higher the portfolio expected return.

Therefore, Eq. (5.5) draws a straight line in the plane  $(\alpha ;\mu_P)$  as in Fig. 5.1.

If short selling is not permitted, the value of  $\alpha$  changes between zero and one  $(0\leq \alpha \leq 1)$ . Specifically, if:

-  $\alpha = 0$ : wealth is invested only in the less risky asset (Asset 1);
-  $\alpha = 1$ : wealth is invested only in the riskier asset (Asset 2).

Otherwise, if short selling is permitted the value of  $\alpha$  changes beyond zero and over one ( $\alpha < 0$ ;  $\alpha > 1$ ), as indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 5.1. Specifically, if:

Fig. 5.1 Portfolio expected return as function of wealth invested in the riskier asset  $(\alpha)$

-  $\alpha < 0$ : there are short selling operations of Asset 2 and buying of Asset 1: this is a risk hedging operation because Asset 2 is riskier than Asset 1;
-  $\alpha > 1$ : there are short selling operations of Asset 1 and buying of Asset 2: this is a speculative operation because Asset 2 is riskier than Asset 1.

In general, for  $N$  assets in the portfolio, the portfolio expected return  $(\mathrm{E}(\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{P}})\equiv \mu_{\mathrm{P}})$  is equal to the weighted average of the expected returns of the assets in portfolio  $(\mathrm{E}(\mathrm{R_k})\equiv \mu_k)$ . Their weights are equal to the share of wealth invested in each one  $(\alpha_{k} = w_{k} / w)$  as follows:

$$
\mathrm {E} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {P}}\right) = \sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} \mathrm {E} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {k}}\right) \leftrightarrow \mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} \mu_ {\mathrm {k}} \quad \text {w i t h} \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} = \frac {\mathrm {w} _ {\mathrm {k}}}{\mathrm {w}} \tag {5.6}
$$

# Portfolio Variance

The portfolio variance measures the variance of the expected portfolio return. It is not equal to the weighted average of the variance of the assets in the portfolio. Indeed, it depends on the covariance, and therefore correlations between the expected return of all assets in the portfolio considered in a pair.

Generally, the portfolio variance  $\left(\sigma_P^2\right)$  is equal to the expected value of the squared difference between the expected return of the portfolio and its average expected return, as follows:

# 5.1 Diversified Portfolio

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \mathrm {E} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {p}} - \mu_ {\mathrm {p}}\right) ^ {2}
$$

Considering that:

$$
R _ {P} = \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {k} R _ {k}; \quad \mu_ {P} = \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {k} \mu_ {k}
$$

and by substituting, we have:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \mathrm {E} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {p}} - \mu_ {\mathrm {p}}\right) ^ {2} = \mathrm {E} \left(\sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {k} R _ {k} - \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {k} \mu_ {k}\right) ^ {2} \tag {5.7}
$$

The analysis of the portfolio's variance can be performed on the basis of two main cases:

Case 1) two assets in the portfolio;
Case 2) more than two assets in the portfolio.

# Case 1) Two Assets in the Portfolio

Assuming a portfolio built on two assets: Asset 1 and Asset 2. Their weights are  $\alpha_{1}$  and  $\alpha_{2}$  respectively. On the basis of Eq. (5.7), the portfolio's variance  $(\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}^{2})$  is equal to:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \mathrm {E} \left[ \alpha_ {1} \mathrm {R} _ {1} + \alpha_ {2} \mathrm {R} _ {2} - \left(\alpha_ {1} \mu_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} \mu_ {2}\right) \right] ^ {2}
$$

and then:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \mathrm {E} \left[ \alpha_ {1} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {1} - \mu_ {1}\right) + \alpha_ {2} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {2} - \mu_ {2}\right) \right] ^ {2} \\ \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \mathrm {E} \left[ \left(\alpha_ {1} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {1} - \mu_ {1}\right)\right) ^ {2} + \left(\alpha_ {2} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {2} - \mu_ {2}\right)\right) ^ {2} + 2 \left(\alpha_ {1} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {1} - \mu_ {1}\right)\right) \left(\alpha_ {2} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {2} - \mu_ {2}\right)\right) \right] \\ \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \mathrm {E} \left[ \alpha_ {1} ^ {2} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {1} - \mu_ {1}\right) ^ {2} + \alpha_ {2} ^ {2} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {2} - \mu_ {2}\right) ^ {2} + 2 \alpha_ {1} \alpha_ {2} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {1} - \mu_ {1}\right) \left(\mathrm {R} _ {2} - \mu_ {2}\right) \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

Considering that: (i) the expected value of the sum of the returns is equal to the sum of the expected value of each return; and (ii) the expected value of the return for a constant is equal to the constant for the expected value of the return, the results are:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \alpha_ {1} ^ {2} \mathrm {E} \left[ \left(\mathrm {R} _ {1} - \mu_ {1}\right) ^ {2} \right] + \alpha_ {2} ^ {2} \mathrm {E} \left[ \left(\mathrm {R} _ {2} - \mu_ {2}\right) ^ {2} \right] + 2 \alpha_ {1} \alpha_ {2} \mathrm {E} [ (\mathrm {R} _ {1} - \mu_ {1}) (\mathrm {R} _ {2} - \mu_ {2}) ]
$$

and by considering that:

$$
E \left[ \left(R _ {1} - \mu_ {1}\right) ^ {2} \right] = \sigma_ {1} ^ {2}; \quad E \left[ \left(R _ {2} - \mu_ {2}\right) ^ {2} \right] = \sigma_ {2} ^ {2}; \quad E [ (R _ {1} - \mu_ {1}) (R _ {2} - \mu_ {2}) ] = \sigma_ {1, 2}
$$

We have:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \alpha_ {1} ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \alpha_ {2} ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + 2 \alpha_ {1} \alpha_ {2} \sigma_ {1, 2} \tag {5.8}
$$

Considering that the correlation coefficient  $\left(\rho_{1,2}\right)$  is equal to the ratio between the covariance of the assets' expected returns  $\left(\sigma_{1,2}\right)$  and the product of their standard deviations  $\left(\sigma_{1} \sigma_{2}\right)$ , we have:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \alpha_ {1} ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \alpha_ {2} ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + 2 \alpha_ {1} \alpha_ {2} \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \tag {5.9}
$$

$$
\rho_ {1, 2} = \frac {\sigma_ {1 , 2}}{\sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}} \rightarrow \sigma_ {1, 2} = \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}
$$

On the basis of the correlation coefficient  $(\rho_{1,2})$ , the portfolio variance can be defined in terms of correlation rather than in terms of covariance. In this case, Eq. (5.8) can be re-written as follows:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \alpha_ {1} ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \alpha_ {2} ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + 2 \alpha_ {1} \alpha_ {2} \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \tag {5.10}
$$

As shown in Eq. (5.10) a key role is played by the covariance (and therefore by correlation) between the assets' expected returns. There are three basic cases:

- positive correlation  $(\rho_{1,2} = +1)$ : in this case the correlation is perfectly positive between the assets' expected returns. They move in the same direction;
- negative correlation  $(\rho_{1,2} = -1)$ : in this case the correlation is perfectly negative between the assets' expected returns. They move in the opposite direction;
- no correlation  $(\rho_{1,2} = 0)$ : in this case there is no correlation between the assets' expected return. They move independently between them.

Equation (5.10) can be rewritten on the basis of the conditions (5.4) as follows:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \alpha^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \alpha (1 - \alpha) \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \tag {5.11}
$$

and by explicating, we have:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \alpha^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \alpha^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - 2 \alpha \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \alpha \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} - 2 \alpha^ {2} \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}
$$

Equation (5.11) draws a curve. On the basis of the first order condition, and then by pointing the first derivative equal to zero, the stationary point is achieved. If the second derivative is positive, the stationary point is a minimum of the curve.

The first derivative of the portfolio variance  $\left(\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}^{2}\right)$ , compared with part of wealth  $(\alpha)$  invested in the riskier asset (Asset 2), is equal to:

$$
\frac {\partial \sigma_ {P} ^ {2}}{\partial \alpha} = 2 \alpha \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + 2 \alpha \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - 2 \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} - 4 \alpha \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}
$$

# 5.1 Diversified Portfolio

and then the first derivative is equal to:

$$
\frac {\partial \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2}}{\partial \alpha} = \alpha \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \alpha \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} - 2 \alpha \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \tag {5.12}
$$

Placing the first derivative equal to zero, and by solving for  $\alpha$ , the stationary point is achieved, as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\partial \sigma_ {P} ^ {2}}{\partial \alpha} = 0 \rightarrow \alpha \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \alpha \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} - 2 \alpha \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} = 0 \\ \alpha = \frac {\sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - \rho_ {1 , 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}}{\sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - 2 \rho_ {1 , 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}} \tag {5.13} \\ \end{array}
$$

The second derivative is equal to:

$$
\frac {\partial^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2}}{\partial^ {2} \alpha} = \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - 2 \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \tag {5.14}
$$

The sign of the second derivative is the function of the correlation coefficient  $(\rho_{1,2})$ . Consider the three extreme cases of the correlation  $(\rho_{1,2} = +1; -1; 0)$ . If:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \rho_ {1, 2} = + 1 \rightarrow \frac {\partial^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2}}{\partial^ {2} \alpha} = \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - 2 \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} = (\sigma_ {2} - \sigma_ {1}) ^ {2} \rightarrow \frac {\partial^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2}}{\partial^ {2} \alpha} > 0 \\ \rho_ {1, 2} = - 1 \rightarrow \frac {\partial^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2}}{\partial^ {2} \alpha} = \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} = (\sigma_ {2} + \sigma_ {1}) ^ {2} \rightarrow \frac {\partial^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2}}{\partial^ {2} \alpha} > 0 \tag {5.15} \\ \rho_ {1, 2} = 0 \rightarrow \frac {\partial^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2}}{\partial^ {2} \alpha} = \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \rightarrow \frac {\partial^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2}}{\partial^ {2} \alpha} > 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

In the first case  $\left(\rho_{1,2} = +1\right)$  the second derivative is positive because  $\sigma_2 > \sigma_1$  (Asset 2 is riskier than Asset 1). Also in the first case, as in the second case  $\left(\rho_{1,2} = -1\right)$ , it is a square of polynomial and therefore the second derivative is positive by definition. In the last case  $\left(\rho_{1,2} = 0\right)$ , the second derivative is positive by definition because the variances, and therefore the standard deviation, are positive.

Therefore, the sign of the second derivative is always positive. Consequently, the curve is convex and the stationary point defined by Eq. (5.13) is a minimum point of the curve. Specifically,  $\alpha$  is the part of wealth to be invested in the riskier asset (Asset 2) to minimize the portfolio variance and therefore portfolio risk.

Now the problem is to define the correct position of  $\alpha$  with regards to its abscissa. Its sign is the function of the sign of the correlation  $(\rho_{1,2})$  and therefore:  $-1 \leq \alpha \leq +1$ .

Also in this case, by considering the tree extreme cases  $\left(\rho_{1,2} = +1; -1; 0\right)$ , and substituting in Eq. (5.13) we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \rho_ {1, 2} = + 1 \rightarrow \alpha = \frac {\sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}}{\sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - 2 \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}} = \frac {\sigma_ {1} (\sigma_ {1} - \sigma_ {2})}{(\sigma_ {2} - \sigma_ {1}) ^ {2}} \\ = \frac {\sigma_ {1}}{\left(\sigma_ {1} - \sigma_ {2}\right)} \rightarrow \sigma_ {2} > \sigma_ {1} \rightarrow \alpha <   0 \rightarrow - 1 \leq \alpha \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \rho_ {1, 2} = - 1 \rightarrow \alpha = \frac {\sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}}{\sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}} = \frac {\sigma_ {1} \left(\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}\right)}{\left(\sigma_ {2} + \sigma_ {1}\right) ^ {2}} \tag {5.16} \\ = \frac {\sigma_ {1}}{\left(\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}\right)} \rightarrow \alpha > 0 \rightarrow 0 \leq \alpha \leq + 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\rho_ {1, 2} = 0 \rightarrow \alpha = \frac {\sigma_ {1} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2}} = \frac {\sigma_ {1}}{(\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2})} \rightarrow \alpha > 0 \rightarrow 0 \leq \alpha \leq + 1
$$

Therefore, in the presence of a perfect positive correlation  $\left(\rho_{1,2} = +1\right)$  between the expected returns of the two assets, the portfolio variance is minimized by a negative value of investment in the riskier asset  $(\alpha < 0)$ . Therefore, this point can be achieved only by short selling as shown in Fig. 5.2 (adapted from Castellani et al. 2005).

Otherwise, in both cases of the presence of perfect negative correlation  $\left(\rho_{1,2} = -1\right)$  and absence of correlation  $\left(\rho_{1,2} = 0\right)$  between the expected returns of the two assets, the portfolio variance is minimized by a positive value of investment in the riskier asset  $(\alpha > 0)$  as shown in Fig. 5.3 (adapted from Castellani et al. 2005).

At this point of the analysis, it is relevant to analyse shifting from the variance to the standard deviation of the portfolio.

Fig. 5.3 The portfolio variance in the case of negative correlation

By starting from the portfolio's variance as defined by Eq. (5.11), the three extreme cases of the correlation  $(\rho_{1,2} = +1; - 1;0)$  can be considered.

If the correlation between the expected returns of the two assets is positive  $\left(\rho_{1,2} = +1\right)$ , Eq. (5.11) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \alpha^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \alpha (1 - \alpha) (1) \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}
$$

and then:

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = [ \alpha \sigma_ {2} + (1 - \alpha) \sigma_ {1} ] ^ {2} = [ \sigma_ {1} + \alpha (\sigma_ {2} - \sigma_ {1}) ] ^ {2} \tag {5.17}
$$

Asset 2 is riskier than Asset 1. Therefore,  $\sigma_{2} > \sigma_{1}$  and then the argument of the square is always positive. Consequently, it is possible to move directly from the portfolio variance  $(\sigma_P^2)$  to its standard deviation  $(\sigma_p)$  as follows:

$$
\sigma_ {P} = \sigma_ {1} + \alpha (\sigma_ {2} - \sigma_ {1})
$$

and solving for part of wealth  $\alpha$  invested in the riskier asset (Asset 2), we have:

$$
\alpha = \frac {\sigma_ {P} - \sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {2} - \sigma_ {1}} \tag {5.18}
$$

Therefore, the portfolio with zero standard deviation is obtained by investing a part of wealth in the riskier asset equal to:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} = 0 \rightarrow \sigma_ {1} + \alpha (\sigma_ {2} - \sigma_ {1}) = 0 \rightarrow \alpha = \frac {\sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} - \sigma_ {2}} \tag {5.19} \\ \equiv \frac {- \sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {2} - \sigma_ {1}} \rightarrow \sigma_ {2} > \sigma_ {1} \rightarrow \alpha <   0 \\ \end{array}
$$

As shown in the case of the portfolio variance, also in this case, clearly to minimize the portfolio's standard deviation and therefore its risk, the part of wealth to be invested in the riskier asset (Asset 2) is negative. Consequently, the minimum risk of the portfolio can only be achieved by short selling if the correlation between the expected returns of the two assets is positive.

On the basis of Eq. (5.5) the portfolio expected return in terms of its standard deviation can be defined, as follows (Cesari 2012b):

$$
\mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \mu_ {1} + \left(\frac {\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} - \sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {2} - \sigma_ {1}}\right) \left(\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}\right) \leftrightarrow \mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \mu_ {1} - \sigma_ {1} \left(\frac {\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}{\sigma_ {2} - \sigma_ {1}}\right) + \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} \left(\frac {\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}{\sigma_ {2} - \sigma_ {1}}\right) \tag {5.20}
$$

Equation (5.20) shows that, since there is a perfect positive linear correlation between the expected returns of the two assets, the risk and the expected returns of the portfolio are a linear combination of the risk and the expected returns of assets.

Considering that the statistical characteristics of the two assets  $(\mu_{1};\sigma_{1};\mu_{2};\sigma_{2})$  are known, and Asset 2 is riskier than Asset 1 (so that:  $\sigma_2 > \sigma_1;\mu_2 > \mu_1\to \frac{\mu_2 - \mu_1}{\sigma_2 - \sigma_1} >0$ ), the portfolio's expected return is linear function of  $\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}$ . Specifically, Eq. (5.20) draws a straight line with intercept equal to  $\left(\mu_{1} - \sigma_{1}\left(\frac{\mu_{2} - \mu_{1}}{\sigma_{2} - \sigma_{1}}\right)\right)$  and the positive slope equal to  $\left(\frac{\mu_2 - \mu_1}{\sigma_2 - \sigma_1}\right)$ . Consequently, all possible combinations between the two assets expected returns must be positioned on a straight line as in Fig. 5.4.

Therefore, in this case the portfolio's volatility is linear function of the  $\alpha$  and so the part of wealth invested in Asset 2 (the riskier asset). Since the standard deviation of Asset 2  $(\sigma_{2})$  is function of  $\alpha$ , a line with interception equal to  $\sigma_{1}$  is achieved and with an angular coefficient equal to  $(\sigma_{2} - \sigma_{1})$ . Then, with an increase in part of the wealth invested in Asset 2 (the riskier asset), and then an increase in  $\alpha$ , the portfolio's risk increases linearly. All possible assets combinations cannot present a risk higher than the risk represented by the line between the two assets.

If the correlation between the expected returns of the two assets is negative  $\left(\rho_{1,2} = -1\right)$ , Eq. (5.11) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \alpha^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \alpha (1 - \alpha) (- 1) \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}
$$

Fig. 5.4 Standard deviation and return of the portfolio in the case of perfect positive correlation  $(\rho_{1,2} = +1)$  between expected returns of the two assets

and then:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \left[ \alpha \sigma_ {2} - (1 - \alpha) \sigma_ {1} \right] ^ {2} = \left[ \alpha \left(\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}\right) - \sigma_ {1} \right] ^ {2} \tag {5.21}
$$

In this case, it is not possible to move from the portfolio variance  $\left(\sigma_P^2\right)$  to its standard deviation  $\left(\sigma_p\right)$  directly, as in the previous case. The argument under the square is function of the part of wealth invested in Asset 2 (the riskier asset) and of the distance between the standard deviation of Asset 2 and Asset 1. Consequently:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {p}} = \left| \alpha \left(\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}\right) - \sigma_ {1} \right|\rightarrow \sigma_ {\mathrm {p}} = \left\{\begin{array}{l l}\alpha \left(\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}\right) - \sigma_ {1}&\text {i f} \quad \alpha \left(\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}\right) - \sigma_ {1} > 0\\\sigma_ {1} - \alpha \left(\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}\right)&\text {i f} \quad \alpha \left(\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}\right) - \sigma_ {1} <   0\end{array}\right. \tag {5.22}
$$

There are two linear relationships: one increasing (if positive) and the other decreasing (if negative). These two lines define the different level of the portfolio's risk  $(\sigma_{P})$  to the  $\alpha$  changes and therefore to the changes of part of wealth invested in the riskier asset (Asset 2).

Since one is always positive when the other is negative, there is always a single solution for calculation of the portfolio risk and return.

Therefore, from the first linear relationship, it follows that:

$$
\sigma_ {P} = \alpha \left(\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}\right) - \sigma_ {1} \rightarrow \alpha = \frac {\sigma_ {P} + \sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}} \tag {5.23}
$$

Also in this case it is possible to define the portfolio's expected return in terms of standard deviation. By substituting  $\alpha$  in Eq. (5.5) the portfolio's expected return is equal to:

$$
\mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \mu_ {1} + \left(\frac {\sigma_ {P} + \sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}}\right) \left(\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}\right) \leftrightarrow \mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \mu_ {1} + \sigma_ {1} \left(\frac {\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}}\right) + \sigma_ {P} \left(\frac {\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}}\right) \tag {5.24}
$$

Therefore, the portfolio's expected return  $(\mu_P)$  is linear function of its standard deviation  $(\sigma_P)$ . Equation (5.24) draws a straight line with interception equal to  $\left(\mu_1 + \sigma_1\left(\frac{\mu_2 - \mu_1}{\sigma_1 + \sigma_2}\right)\right)$  and slope equal to  $\left(\frac{\mu_2 - \mu_1}{\sigma_1 + \sigma_2}\right)$ . Since Asset 2 is riskier than Asset 1 (so that:  $\sigma_2 > \sigma_1$ ;  $\mu_2 > \mu_1 \rightarrow \frac{\mu_2 - \mu_1}{\sigma_1 + \sigma_2} > 0$ ), the slope is positive.

Similarly, from the second linear equation, we have:

$$
\sigma_ {P} = \sigma_ {1} - \alpha \left(\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}\right)\rightarrow \alpha = \frac {\sigma_ {1} - \sigma_ {P}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}} \tag {5.25}
$$

In this case, the portfolio's expected return in terms of standard deviation is equal to:

$$
\mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \mu_ {1} + \left(\frac {\sigma_ {1} - \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}}\right) \left(\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}\right) \leftrightarrow \mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \mu_ {1} + \sigma_ {1} \left(\frac {\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}}\right) + \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} \left(\frac {\mu_ {1} - \mu_ {2}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}}\right) \tag {5.26}
$$

The portfolio's expected return  $(\mu_{\mathrm{P}})$  is linear function of its standard deviation  $(\sigma_P)$ . Furthermore, also in this case Eq. (5.26) draws a straight line with interception equal to  $\left(\mu_1 + \sigma_1\left(\frac{\mu_2 - \mu_1}{\sigma_1 + \sigma_2}\right)\right)$  and slope equal to  $\left(\frac{\mu_2 - \mu_1}{\sigma_1 + \sigma_2}\right)$ . Since the Asset 2 is riskier than Asset 1 (so that  $\sigma_2 > \sigma_1$ ;  $\mu_2 > \mu_1 \rightarrow \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sigma_1 + \sigma_2} < 0$ ) the slope is negative.

Therefore, based on Eqs. (5.24) and (5.26), the relationship between risk and return of the portfolio with perfect negative correlation  $\left(\rho_{1,2} = -1\right)$  among the expected returns of the two assets can be represented as in Fig. 5.5.

In the case of negative correlation between the assets' expected returns, their systemic movements in opposite directions allows for cancellation of the risk. It is achieved in the point of intersection of the two lines on the ordinate.

Specifically, by assuming a portfolio with zero standard deviation, the part of wealth invested in the riskier asset is equal to:

Fig. 5.5 Standard deviation and return of the portfolio in the case of perfect negative correlation  $(\rho_{1,2} = -1)$  between the expected returns of the two assets

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} = 0 \rightarrow\begin{array}{l}\alpha (\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}) - \sigma_ {1} = 0 \rightarrow \alpha = \frac {\sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}}\\\sigma_ {1} - \alpha (\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}) = 0 \rightarrow \alpha = \frac {\sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}}\end{array}\rightarrow \alpha > 0 \tag {5.27}
$$

Equation (5.27) shows two main elements:

- first, the point in which the two linear equations have the same value, the standard deviation of the portfolio is equal to zero and therefore the portfolio has no risk;
- second, the minimization of the portfolio's standard deviation can be achieved for a positive value of the investment in the riskier asset (Asset 2):  $0 < \alpha^{*} < 1$ .

Therefore, in the case of a perfect positive correlation, the portfolio with minimum risk can be achieved for negative value of investment  $(\alpha^{*} < 0)$  in the riskier asset (Asset 2) by short selling, while in the perfect negative correlation it is achieved for positive value of investment  $(0 < \alpha^{*} < 1)$  in the riskier asset.

The analysis of the two cases of perfect positive and negative correlation between the expected returns of the two assets  $\left(\rho_{1,2} = +1; \rho_{1,2} = -1\right)$  shows that the portfolio's risk in terms of standard deviation  $(\sigma_P)$  is higher for the positive correlation than the negative one as indicated in Fig. 5.6.

In the plan  $(\sigma_P; \mu_P)$ , the portfolio's standard deviation is lower in the case of a perfect negative correlation  $(\rho_{1,2} = -1)$  and it is higher in the case of a perfect positive correlation  $(\rho_{1,2} = +1)$ . The space defined by the lines classifies all

possible portfolios obtained by the changes in the correlations between the assets' expected returns  $(-1 < \rho_{1,2} < +1)$ .

If there is no correlation between the expected returns of the two assets is negative  $\left(\rho_{1,2} = 0\right)$ , Eq. (5.11) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \alpha^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \alpha (1 - \alpha) (0) \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}
$$

and then:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \alpha^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} = \alpha^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \alpha^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - 2 \alpha \sigma_ {1} ^ {2}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \alpha^ {2} \left(\sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2}\right) - 2 \alpha \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \tag {5.28}
$$

In this case, the vertex of the parabola can be used. In this case the minimum of the parabola is the minimum point of the portfolio's variance and standard deviation. Therefore, the part of wealth to invest in the riskier asset (Asset 2)  $\alpha$  is equal to the abscissa of the parabola's vertex as follows:

$$
\alpha = - \frac {b}{2 a} = - \frac {- 2 \sigma_ {1} ^ {2}}{2 \left(\sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2}\right)} = \frac {\sigma_ {1} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2}} \tag {5.29}
$$

Considering that  $\sigma_1^2$  and  $\sigma_2^2$  are variances and therefore they are positive by definition, the value of  $\alpha$  is positive ( $\alpha > 0$ ) and it is possible to move from the variance to standard deviation as follows:

$$
\alpha = \frac {\sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}} \rightarrow \alpha^ {*} > 0 \tag {5.30}
$$

Considering that  $\alpha$  is positive, the concave nature of the parabola is upwards and therefore  $\alpha$  is a minimum point. This is the same result of the negative correlation.

Consequently, by investing a part of wealth in the riskier asset (Asset 2) equal to  $\alpha$ , the portfolio's variance and standard deviation is at a minimum point. Indeed, in this case the portfolio's variance is lower than the case in which the total wealth is invested in Asset 1 (the less risky asset). Therefore, the minimum portfolio risk (as measured by variance or standard deviation) is obtained by investing a part of wealth equal to  $\alpha$  in Asset 2 (the riskier asset) and the remaining wealth in Asset 1, as shown in Fig. 5.7.

The portfolio  $A$  is defined as the minimum portfolio risk. Therefore, it is necessary to define the value of  $\alpha$  that allows for a reduction to the minimum level of the portfolio's risk (variance or standard deviation) and therefore the portfolio's risk. In other words, it is necessary to define the part of wealth to be invested in the riskier asset (Asset 2) in order to obtain the portfolio with the minimum risk.

It is possible to represent Fig. 5.7 with regards to  $\alpha$  by moving from the plan  $(\sigma_P;\mu_P)$  to the plan  $(\sigma_P;\alpha)$  as in Fig. 5.8 (adapted from Castellani et al. 2005).

It is important to note that generally, correlations between the assets' expected returns tend to be different from zero, because all assets are affected by economic dynamics and they tend to be more positive than negative.

Fig. 5.8 Portfolio's standard deviation function of  $\alpha$

Specifically, the correlation coefficient changes between the range:  $-1\leq \rho_{1,2}\leq +1$ . Theoretically the effects of diversification start for a  $\rho_{1,2} < + 1$  and they increase gradually until  $\rho_{1,2} = -1$ . The smaller the correlation, the more the curve bends; the greater inclination of the curve is achieved for  $\rho_{1,2} = -1$ , as shown in Figs. 5.7 and 5.8.

Unfortunately, in capital markets, the cases  $\rho_{1,2} = -1$  is only theoretical (Ross et al. 2015). Generally, the cases of  $\rho_{1,2} = +1$ ;  $0$ ;  $-1$  represent a theoretical hypothesis and they create a space in which all portfolios can be found as function of the correlations between the assets' expected returns according to the changes of  $\alpha$ , as shown in Figs. 5.7 and 5.8.

In capital markets the correlation between the assets' expected returns tend to be higher than zero and lower than  $1$  ( $0 < \rho_{1,2} < +1$ ). Consequently, in the absence of short selling (and therefore for positive value of assets in the portfolio), the diversification effect is greater as the lower the level of correlation between the asset's expected returns ( $\rho \approx 0$ ). Specifically, we have:

$$
0 <   \rho_ {1, 2} \leq \frac {\sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {2}} \tag {5.31}
$$

with  $\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}$  very small. In this case, the increase in wealth invested in Asset 2 (riskier asset) reduces the portfolio's variance more than the variance of the portfolio consisting of Asset 1 (the less risky asset) only. The part of wealth to be invested in Asset 2 to minimize the portfolio's variance is equal to:

# 5.1 Diversified Portfolio

$$
\alpha = \frac {\sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}} \tag {5.32}
$$

For investments in Asset 2 greater than  $\alpha$ , the portfolio's variance increases.

The most important problem is the dimension of the ratio between the two standard deviations: the higher it is, and therefore the closer it gets to 1, the lower the effects of diversification.

It is worth noting that diversification does not have a value. It is a general concept that acquires value only by defining the target of risk and portfolio return. The trade-off between risk and return is the optimality mean-variance problem.

# Case 2) More Than Two Assets in the Portfolio

The analysis developed for two assets in the portfolio can be generalized by considering a portfolio of  $N$  assets.

In this case the covariance, and therefore the correlation, between the expected returns of the assets are calculated by considering the assets in pairs.

To calculate the portfolio's variance  $\left(\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}^{2}\right)$  it is necessary to use the Covariance Matrix  $(C)$ , as follows:

$$
C = \left[ \begin{array}{l l l l} \sigma_ {1, 1} & \sigma_ {1, 2} & \dots & \sigma_ {1, n} \\ \sigma_ {2, 1} & \sigma_ {2, 2} & \dots & \sigma_ {2, n} \\ \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\ \sigma_ {n, 1} & \sigma_ {n, 2} & \dots & \sigma_ {n, n} \end{array} \right] \tag {5.33}
$$

In order to avoid the determinant of the matrix being equal to zero, the assets' returns in the rows and columns are not characterized by: (i) elements that are null; (ii) parallels rows or columns that are equal or proportional between them; (iii) parallels rows or columns that are linear combinations of each other.

It is worth noting that because correlation between pairs of assets (i-th and j-th) is calculated, the first index  $(i)$  can assume  $N$  value (one of each of the assets) while the second index  $(j)$  can assume a value of  $(N - 1)$  because  $i\neq j$ . Consequently, there are  $N(N - 1)$  correlation coefficients. Also, because the correlation coefficient between  $i$  and  $j$  is equal to the correlation coefficient between  $j$  and  $i$ , it is necessary to consider  $[N(N - 1)] / 2$  correlation coefficients (for example, for 250 assets, there are 31.125 correlation coefficients to calculate). Formally:

$$
\rho_ {i, j} = [ N (N - 1) ] / 2 \tag {5.34}
$$

The general term  $\sigma_{k,j}$  (note that  $\sigma_{k,j} = \sigma_{j,k}$  for symmetry) indicates the covariance between the expected returns of the k-th asset  $(I_k)$  and the j-th asset  $(I_j)$  in portfolio, as follows:

$$
\sigma_ {k, j} = \mathrm {E} \left[ \left(\mathrm {I} _ {\mathrm {k}} - \mu_ {\mathrm {k}}\right) \left(\mathrm {I} _ {\mathrm {j}} - \mu_ {\mathrm {j}}\right) \right] \quad \text {p e r} \quad k, j = 1, 2, \dots , n \tag {5.35}
$$

and  $k = j$  we have a  $(\sigma_k^2)$ , and therefore the standard deviation  $(\sigma_k)$ , as follows:

$$
\sigma_ {k, k} = E \left[\left(I _ {k} - \mu_ {k}\right)\left(I _ {k} - \mu_ {k}\right)\right] = E \left[\left(I _ {k} - \mu_ {k}\right) ^ {2} \right] = \operatorname {V a r} \left(I _ {k}\right) = \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} \rightarrow \sigma_ {k} = \sqrt {\sigma_ {k} ^ {2}} \tag {5.36}
$$

For positive values of the variance (and therefore not considering the risk-free asset that represents a specific case because its return is sure resulting in variance being null) we have:

$$
\sigma_ {k, j} = \sigma_ {k} \sigma_ {j} \rightarrow \text {P o s i t i v e C o r r e l a t i o n}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {k, j} = - \sigma_ {k} \sigma_ {j} \rightarrow N e g a t i v e C o r r e l a t i o n
$$

$$
\sigma_ {k, j} = 0 \rightarrow N o C o r r e l a t i o n
$$

On the basis of the weight of each asset in the portfolio  $\left(\alpha_{\mathrm{k}} = \frac{\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{k}}}{\mathrm{W}}\right.$  for  $\mathrm{k} = 1,2,\dots ,\mathrm{n})$  , it is possible to move from the Covariance Matrix  $(C)$  to the Covariance Weighted Matrix  $(C_{\alpha})$  , as follows:

$$
C _ {\alpha} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} \alpha_ {1} \alpha_ {1} \sigma_ {1, 1} & \alpha_ {1} \alpha_ {2} \sigma_ {1, 2} & \dots & \alpha_ {1} \alpha_ {n} \sigma_ {1, n} \\ \alpha_ {2} \alpha_ {1} \sigma_ {2, 1} & \alpha_ {2} \alpha_ {2} \sigma_ {2, 2} & \dots & \alpha_ {2} \alpha_ {n} \sigma_ {2, n} \\ \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\ \alpha_ {n} \alpha_ {1} \sigma_ {n, 1} & \alpha_ {n} \alpha_ {2} \sigma_ {n, 2} & \dots & \alpha_ {n} \alpha_ {n} \sigma_ {n, n} \end{array} \right] \tag {5.37}
$$

Based on Eq. (5.7), the portfolio's variance  $\left(\sigma_P^2\right)$  is equal to:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = E \left[ \left(R _ {P} - \mu_ {P}\right) ^ {2} \right] = \mathrm {E} \left[ \left(\sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {k} R _ {k} - \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {k} \mu_ {k}\right) ^ {2} \right] \\ = E \left[ \left(\sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {k} \left(R _ {k} - \mu_ {k}\right)\right) ^ {2} \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

and therefore by adding all terms of the Covariance Weighted Matrix  $(\mathbf{C}_{\alpha})$ , the portfolio's variance  $\left(\sigma_{P}^{2}\right)$  and standard deviation  $(\sigma_{P})$  are equal to:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}, \mathrm {j}} \rightarrow \sigma_ {P} = \sqrt {\sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k} , \mathrm {j}}} \tag {5.38}
$$

Normally the linear correlation coefficient  $\left(\rho_{k,j}\right)$  is used instead of the covariance: while the second only indicates the presence or absence of a linear relationship between the variables, the first measures the intensity of this relationship. It

# 5.1 Diversified Portfolio

is equal to the ratio between the covariance among the returns of the k-th and j-th assets  $(\sigma_{kj})$  and the product among their standard deviations  $(\sigma_k; \sigma_j)$  as follows:

$$
\rho_ {k, j} = \frac {\sigma_ {k j}}{\sigma_ {k} \sigma_ {j}} \rightarrow \sigma_ {k j} = \rho_ {k, j} \sigma_ {k} \sigma_ {j}
$$

Using the correlation coefficient, the Correlation Matrix  $\left(C_{\rho}\right)$  can be used, as follows:

$$
\mathrm {C} _ {\rho} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} 1 & \rho_ {1, 2} & \dots & \rho_ {1, \mathrm {n}} \\ \rho_ {2, 1} & 1 & \dots & \rho_ {2, \mathrm {n}} \\ \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\ \rho_ {\mathrm {n}, 1} & \rho_ {\mathrm {n}, 2} & \dots & 1 \end{array} \right] \tag {5.39}
$$

On the basis of the Correlation Matrix the portfolio's variance  $\left(\sigma_P^2\right)$  is computed by modifying Eq. (5.38) as follows:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \rho_ {\mathrm {k}, \mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {j}} \rightarrow \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} = \sqrt {\sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \rho_ {\mathrm {k} , \mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {j}}} \tag {5.40}
$$

For greater understanding of the diversification effects due to the covariance (and therefore correlations) between the expected returns of the  $N$  assets in portfolio, a breakdown of the double summation as derived from the Covariance Weighted Matrix  $(C_{\alpha})$  may be useful, as follows (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}} ^ {2} + \sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \sum_ {\substack {\mathrm {j} = 1 \\ \mathrm {j} \neq \mathrm {k}}} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}, \mathrm {j}} \tag{5.41}
$$

In the second part of Eq. (5.41) the double summation implies that the  $j \neq k$ . Indeed, for  $j = k$  it results in the variance as for the matrix symmetry we have:  $\alpha_{i,j} = \alpha_{j,i} \quad \forall i,j; i \neq j$ .

Therefore, because  $j = k$  and  $k = j$ , it is necessary to consider the square. Specifically:

- the first part refers to the terms of variance of each asset multiplied for the square of the investment. Therefore, it refers to the sum of the  $n$  terms square of the matrix;
- the second part refers to the terms of covariance between the expected return of the assets in portfolio considering them as a pair. Each covariance is multiplied by twice the product of the weights of the two assets according to the symmetry of the matrix. Therefore, it refers to the sum of the  $N(N - 1)$  triangle of the matrix (while  $k$  can assume  $N$  value, since  $j \neq k$ ,  $j$  can assume  $(N - 1)$  value).

Equation (5.41) shows that the key term is the second. The most relevant effect on the portfolio's variance is represented by the covariance between the expected returns of the assets considered in a pair rather than the variance of the expected return of each asset. Consequently, the risk diversification is function of the covariance between the expected returns of the  $n$  assets in portfolio by considering them in a pair rather than their specific variance.

Specifically, if the:

- covariance is near to zero: the assets are linearly independent between them, and therefore the portfolio variance is lower than the variance of each asset;
- covariance is positive (negative): the assets are linearly dependent between them, and therefore the variance of the assets moves in the same direction (positive or negative). Therefore, the portfolio variance is higher the closer it gets to 1  $(-1)$ . In this case, the portfolio variance is higher than the variance of each asset.

Therefore, the risk of each asset is not important, but the change that it creates in the portfolio variance due to its introduction as a function of the covariance between its expected returns and the expected returns of the other assets in portfolio.

It is worth noting that the concept of diversification is not defined in itself. It is not possible to define a general role capable of indicating the reduction of the portfolio's risk to the increase of assets.

For greater understanding of the diversification and its effects, we can assume a portfolio  $(P)$  composed of  $N$  risky assets. Assuming that the wealth  $(w)$  invested in the portfolio is equal to  $1(w = 1)$ , and the weight of each asset in the portfolio is equal to  $\alpha_{k} = 1 / n(k = 1,2,\dots,n)$  (Elton et al. 2013).

Based on Eq. (5.41) the portfolio variance  $\left(\sigma_P^2\right)$  is equal to:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \left(\frac {1}{\mathrm {n}}\right) ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}} ^ {2} + \sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \sum_ {\substack {\mathrm {j} = 1 \\ \mathrm {j} \neq \mathrm {k}}} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \left(\frac {1}{\mathrm {n}}\right) \left(\frac {1}{\mathrm {n}}\right) \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}, \mathrm {j}} \tag{5.42}
$$

where:

- the first term is the variance (VT);
- the second term is the covariance (CT).

Equation (5.42) can be re-arranged as follows:

$$
\sigma_{P}^{2} = \left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\sum_{k = 1}^{n}\left(\frac{\sigma_{k}^{2}}{n}\right) + \left(\frac{n - 1}{n}\right)\sum_{k = 1}^{n}\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq k}}^{n}\left(\frac{\sigma_{kj}}{n(n - 1)}\right)
$$

The terms in brackets in the summation are mean: the first is the mean variance  $\left(\bar{\sigma}_k^2\right)$  of the expected returns of assets in portfolio, while the second is the mean

# 5.1 Diversified Portfolio

covariance  $\left(\overline{\sigma}_{k,j}\right)$  between the expected returns of the assets in portfolio considering them in a pair.

By replacing them, the portfolio variance can be defined as follows (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \left(\frac {1}{n}\right) \bar {\sigma} _ {\mathrm {k}} ^ {2} + \left(1 - \frac {1}{n}\right) \bar {\sigma} _ {\mathrm {k}, \mathrm {j}} \leftrightarrow \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \left(\frac {1}{n}\right) \left(\bar {\sigma} _ {\mathrm {k}} ^ {2} - \bar {\sigma} _ {\mathrm {k}, \mathrm {j}}\right) + \bar {\sigma} _ {\mathrm {k}, \mathrm {j}} \tag {5.43}
$$

Equation (5.43) provides understanding of the contribution of the variance and covariance on the portfolio variance according to the increase in the number  $(n)$  of the assets. Indeed, the limits to infinity for the number of the asset  $(n)$ , are the following:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \lim  _ {n \rightarrow \infty} \frac {1}{n} \bar {\sigma} _ {k} ^ {2} = 0; \quad \lim  _ {n \rightarrow \infty} \left(1 - \frac {1}{n}\right) \bar {\sigma} _ {k, j} = \bar {\sigma} _ {k, j} \tag {5.44} \\ \lim  _ {n \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac {1}{n}\right)\left(\bar {\sigma} _ {k} ^ {2} - \bar {\sigma} _ {k, j}\right) + \bar {\sigma} _ {k, j} = \bar {\sigma} _ {k, j} \\ \end{array}
$$

The limits to infinity of Eq. (5.43) show that the contribution to the portfolio variance of the variance of each asset goes to zero while the contribution of the covariance goes to the mean covariance. Consequently, the specific risk of each asset is diversified and the only relevant term for the portfolio's variance is the covariance between the expected returns of the assets considered in a pair.

Therefore, for the k-th asset in portfolio, only its marginal contribution to the portfolio risk is relevant. It can be called the asset's marginal risk. Consequently, introduction of the k-th asset in the portfolio requires the calculation of (Castellani et al. 2005; Elton et al. 2013):

- the k-th asset's marginal contribution to portfolio's returns  $(PR_{MC(k)})$ ;
- the k-th asset's marginal contribution to portfolio's variance  $(PV_{MC(k)})$ ;
- the k-th asset's marginal contribution to portfolio's standard deviation  $(PSD_{MC(k)})$ .

To do this, the partial derivatives of expected returns should be calculated, variance and standard deviation of the portfolio compared with the k-th asset's weight  $(\alpha_{k})$  as defined on the basis of wealth invested on the total wealth invested in the portfolio.

The  $k$ -th asset's marginal contribution to the portfolio returns  $\left(PR_{MC(k)}\right)$  is calculated based on the partial derivative of the portfolio expected returns  $(\mu_P)$  with regards to the  $k$ -th asset's weight  $(\alpha_k)$  (Castellani et al. 2005).

Consider that:

$$
\mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} \mu_ {\mathrm {i}} \quad \mathrm {i} = 1, 2, 3, \dots , \mathrm {n}
$$

It involves a lot of terms that do not contain an  $\alpha_{k}$  and only one term including  $\alpha_{k}$ . The derivatives of all terms that do not include  $\alpha_{k}$ , and therefore for each

$\alpha_{i} \neq \alpha_{k}$ , are equal to zero because they are constants as far as  $\alpha_{k}$  is concerned. In this case, the term including  $\alpha_{k}$  is  $\alpha_{k}\mu_{k}$ . Therefore, the first derivative is equal to:

$$
\frac {\partial \mu_ {\mathrm {P}}}{\partial \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}}} = \frac {\partial}{\partial \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}}} \left[ \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} \mu_ {\mathrm {i}} \right] = \frac {\partial}{\partial \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}}} [ \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} \mu_ {\mathrm {k}} ] = 1 \mu_ {\mathrm {k}} = \mu_ {\mathrm {k}}
$$

Consequently, the marginal contribution of the k-th asset to the portfolio's returns, is equal to its expected returns:

$$
\mathrm {P R} _ {\mathrm {M C (k)}} = \frac {\partial \mu_ {\mathrm {P}}}{\partial \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}}} = \mu_ {\mathrm {k}} \tag {5.45}
$$

The  $k$ -th asset's marginal contribution to the portfolio variance  $(PV_{MC(k)})$  is calculated based on the partial derivative of the portfolio variance  $(\sigma_P^2)$  with respect to the  $k$ -th asset's weight  $(\alpha_k)$ . It measures the  $k$ -th asset's marginal risk (in terms of variance).

Considering that:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2} + \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \sum_ {\substack {\mathrm {j} = 1 \\ \mathrm {j} \neq \mathrm {i}}} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {i}, \mathrm {j}}
$$

We have:

$$
\frac{\partial\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}^{2}}{\partial\alpha_{\mathrm{k}}} = \frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha_{\mathrm{k}}}\left[\sum_{\mathrm{i} = 1}^{\mathrm{n}}\alpha_{\mathrm{i}}^{2}\sigma_{\mathrm{i}}^{2} + \sum_{\mathrm{i} = 1}^{\mathrm{n}}\sum_{\substack{\mathrm{j} = 1\\ \mathrm{j}\neq \mathrm{i}}}^{\mathrm{n}}\alpha_{\mathrm{i}}\alpha_{\mathrm{j}}\sigma_{\mathrm{i},\mathrm{j}}\right]
$$

The partial derivative of the first term follows the same principles as discussed earlier. All of the terms that do not include  $\alpha_{k}$  are constant as far as  $\alpha_{k}$  is concerned. Therefore, their derivative is zero. Consequently, the derivative of each term  $\alpha_{i}$  different from  $\alpha_{k}$ , and therefore for each  $\alpha_{\mathrm{i}} \neq \alpha_{\mathrm{k}}$ , is equal to zero. In this case, the term involving  $\alpha_{\mathrm{k}}$  is:

$$
\alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}} ^ {2}
$$

and therefore its derivative is equal to:

$$
\frac {\partial}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} \left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} \right] = \frac {\partial}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} \left[ \alpha_ {k} ^ {2} \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} \right] = 2 \alpha_ {k} \sigma_ {k} ^ {2}
$$

# 5.1 Diversified Portfolio

The partial derivative of the second term is calculated by considering that  $\alpha_{k}$  is calculated twice: once when  $i = k$  and once when  $j = k$ .

In the first case, when  $i = k$ , we have:

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq i}}^{n}\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{i,j} = \sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq k}}^{n}\alpha_{k}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{k,j} = \alpha_{k}\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq k}}^{n}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{k,j}
$$

and the partial derivative is equal to:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha_{k}}\left[\alpha_{k}\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq k}}^{n}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{k,j}\right] = 1\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq k}}^{n}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{k,j} = \sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq k}}^{n}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{k,j}
$$

In the second case, when  $j = k$ , we have:

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq i}}^{n}\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{i,j} = \sum_{\substack{i = 1\\ i\neq k}}^{n}\alpha_{i}\alpha_{k}\sigma_{i,k} = \alpha_{k}\sum_{\substack{i = 1\\ i\neq k}}^{n}\alpha_{i}\sigma_{i,k}
$$

and its derivatives are equal to:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha_{k}}\left[\alpha_{k}\sum_{\substack{i = 1\\ i\neq k}}^{n}\alpha_{i}\sigma_{i,k}\right] = 1\sum_{\substack{i = 1\\ i\neq k}}^{n}\alpha_{i}\sigma_{i,k} = \sum_{\substack{i = 1\\ i\neq k}}^{n}\alpha_{i}\sigma_{i,k}
$$

Since  $i$  and  $j$  are simply summation indicators and therefore it does not matter which one is used, and since the variance-covariance matrix is symmetric, we have:

$$
\sigma_ {i, j} = \sigma_ {j, i} \rightarrow \sigma_ {i, k} = \sigma_ {k, i} \leftrightarrow \sigma_ {k, j} = \sigma_ {j, k}
$$

and therefore:

$$
\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq k}}^{n}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{k,j} = \sum_{\substack{i = 1\\ i\neq k}}^{n}\alpha_{i}\sigma_{i,k}
$$

Consequently, the derivative of the second term is equal to:

$$
\frac {\partial}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} \left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \sum_ {j = 1 \atop j \neq i} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i, j} \right] = \sum_ {j = 1 \atop j \neq k} ^ {n} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k, j} + \sum_ {j = 1 \atop j \neq k} ^ {n} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k, j} = 2 \sum_ {j = 1 \atop j \neq k} ^ {n} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k, j}
$$

Summing the first and the second derivatives, the portfolio variance derivative is achieved, as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha_{k}}\left[\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\alpha_{i}^{2}\sigma_{i}^{2} + \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq i}}^{n}\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{i,j}\right] = 2\alpha_{k}\sigma_{k}^{2} + 2\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq k}}^{n}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{k,j}
$$

Summing the terms, and therefore by introducing the first term in the summation dropping the constraint  $(j\neq k)$ , we have:

$$
2\alpha_{k}\sigma_{k}^{2} + 2\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq k}}^{N}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{k,j} = 2\sum_{j = 1}^{n}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{k,j}
$$

Therefore, the marginal contribution of the k-th asset to the portfolio variance is equal to:

$$
\mathrm {P V} _ {\mathrm {M C} (\mathrm {k})} = \frac {\partial \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2}}{\partial \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}}} = 2 \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}, \mathrm {j}} \tag {5.46}
$$

It is relevant to note that by considering the covariance between the portfolio returns and the k-th asset's returns  $(\sigma_{k,P})$ , we have:

$$
\sigma_ {k, P} = E \left[ \left(I _ {K} - \mu_ {k}\right) \left(I _ {P} - \mu_ {P}\right) \right]
$$

and considering that:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {k, P} = E \left[ \left(I _ {K} - \mu_ {k}\right) \left(I _ {P} - \mu_ {P}\right) \right] = E \left[ \left(I _ {K} - \mu_ {k}\right) \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {j} \left(I _ {j} - \mu_ {j}\right) \right] \\ = E \left[ \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {j} \left(I _ {k} - \mu_ {k}\right) \left(I _ {j} - \mu_ {j}\right) \right] \\ = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {j} E \left[ \left(I _ {k} - \mu_ {k}\right) \left(I _ {j} - \mu_ {j}\right) \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

and considering that:

$$
E \left[ \left(I _ {k} - \mu_ {k}\right) \left(I _ {j} - \mu_ {j}\right) \right] = \sigma_ {k, j}
$$

we have:

# 5.1 Diversified Portfolio

$$
\sigma_ {k, P} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k, j}
$$

and by replacing, Eq. (5.46) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\mathrm {P V} _ {\mathrm {M C} (\mathrm {k})} = \frac {\partial \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2}}{\partial \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}}} = 2 \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}, \mathrm {j}} = 2 \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}, \mathrm {P}} \tag {5.47}
$$

Finally, the  $k$ -th asset's marginal contribution to the portfolio standard deviation  $(PSD_{MC(k)})$ , is calculated based on the partial derivative of the portfolio standard deviation  $(\sigma_P)$  compared with the  $k$ -th asset's weight  $(\alpha_k)$ . It measures the  $k$ -th asset's marginal risk (in terms of standard deviation).

By considering that:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {P} = \sqrt {\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2}} = \sqrt {\sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2} + \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \sum_ {\substack {\mathrm {j} = 1 \\ \mathrm {j} \neq \mathrm {i}}} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {i}, \mathrm {j}}} \\ = \left(\sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2} + \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \sum_ {\substack {\mathrm {j} = 1 \\ \mathrm {j} \neq \mathrm {i}}} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {i}, \mathrm {j}}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\partial \sigma_ {P}}{\partial \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}}} = \frac {\partial}{\partial \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}}} \left[ \left(\sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2} + \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \sum_ {\substack {\mathrm {j} = 1 \\ \mathrm {j} \neq \mathrm {i}}} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {i}, \mathrm {j}}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \right] \\ = \left(\frac {1}{2}\right) \left(\sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2} + \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \sum_ {\substack {\mathrm {j} = 1 \\ \mathrm {j} \neq \mathrm {i}}} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {i}, \mathrm {j}}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2} - 1} \left(2 \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}} ^ {2} + 2 \sum_ {\substack {\mathrm {j} = 1 \\ \mathrm {j} \neq \mathrm {k}}} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}, \mathrm {j}}\right) \\ = \left(\frac {1}{2}\right) \left(\sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2} + \sum_ {\substack {\mathrm {j} = 1 \\ \mathrm {j} \neq \mathrm {i}}} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {i}, \mathrm {j}}\right) ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} \left(2 \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}} ^ {2} + 2 \sum_ {\substack {\mathrm {j} = 1 \\ \mathrm {j} \neq \mathrm {k}}} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}, \mathrm {j}}\right) \\ = \frac {\left(\frac {1}{2}\right) \left(2 \alpha_ {k} \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} + 2 \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq k}} ^ {n} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k , j}\right)}{\left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq i}} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i , j}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2}}} \\ = \frac {\left(\frac {1}{2}\right) \left(2 \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k} , \mathrm {j}}\right)}{\sigma_ {P}} = \frac {\left(\frac {1}{2}\right) \left(2 \sigma_ {\mathrm {k} , \mathrm {p}}\right)}{\sigma_ {P}} = \frac {\sigma_ {\mathrm {k} , \mathrm {p}}}{\sigma_ {P}} \\ \end{array}
$$

Therefore, the marginal contribution of the k-th asset to the portfolio's standard deviation is equal to:

$$
\mathrm {P S D} _ {\mathrm {M C} (\mathrm {k})} = \frac {\partial \sigma_ {P}}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} = \frac {\sigma_ {k , P}}{\sigma_ {P}} \tag {5.48}
$$

It is worth noting that the constraint  $\sum_{k=1}^{n} w_k = 1$  is not considered in the partial derivatives. Consequently, the portfolio variance  $(\sigma_P^2)$  and the standard deviation  $(\sigma_P)$  are functions of  $n$  and not  $(n-1)$  assets, and therefore are all considered as variance and covariance between them. This is because only the change in the portfolio risk is relevant due to the introduction of the k-th asset (function of the covariance between its expected returns and the expected returns of all other assets considered in couples and the k-th weights in the portfolio), and not the diversification measure (Castellani et al. 2005).

Therefore,  $\frac{\sigma_{k,P}}{\sigma_P}$  is the relevant measurement of risk for the k-th asset. It measures the marginal contribution to the portfolio risk due to the introduction of the k-th asset.

# 5.2 Efficient Frontier

The second step of the process is construction of the efficient frontier (Lintner 1965; Chen et al. 1971, 1975; Hill 1976; Chen 1977; Alexander 1976, 1977, 1978; Bawa et al. 1979; Bertsekas 1974; Buser 1977; Jones-Lee 1971; Dybving 1984; Jacob 1974; Lewis 1988). It has a different form as function of short selling. However, an analysis of the efficient frontier when there is short selling, can be interpreted as an extension of the analysis when there is no short selling (Elton et al. 2013).

For further understanding, the analysis can be developed on the basis of three main cases (Castellani et al. 2005):

Case 1) two risky assets in portfolio;
Case 2)  $N$  risky assets in portfolio;
- (Case 3)  $N$  risky assets and one free-risk asset in portfolio.

# Case 1) Two Risky Assets in Portfolio

Assuming a portfolio of two risky assets:

- Asset  $I(A_{1})$ : its weight in portfolio  $(\alpha_{1})$  is equal to the part of wealth invested in it  $(w_{1})$  on total wealth invested in the portfolio  $(w)$  so that  $\alpha_{1} = w_{1} / w$ ;
- Asset 2  $(A_{2})$ : its weight in portfolio  $(\alpha_{2})$  is equal to the part of wealth invested in it  $(w_{2})$  on total wealth invested in the portfolio  $(w)$  so that  $\alpha_{2} = w_{2} / w$ .

# 5.2 Efficient Frontier

Assuming that Asset 2 is riskier than Asset 1. On the basis of Eq. (5.4) we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} - \mu_ {2} > \mu_ {1}; \\ - \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} > \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \rightarrow \sigma_ {2} > \sigma_ {1}. \\ \end{array}
$$

and by assuming that the part of wealth invested in Asset 2 is equal to  $\alpha$  and consequently the part of wealth invested in Asset 1 is equal to the  $1 - \alpha$ , we have:

$$
\alpha_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} = 1 \leftrightarrow \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \alpha_ {2} = \alpha \\ \alpha_ {1} = 1 - \alpha \end{array} \quad (0 <   \alpha <   1) \right.
$$

Changing  $\alpha$ , and therefore the part of wealth invested in Asset 2 (riskier asset), all portfolios can be obtained on the basis of all possible combinations between the two assets.

It is worth noting that:

- if there is no short selling,  $\alpha$  can change in the range [0; 1] so that:  $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$ ;
- if there is short selling,  $\alpha$  may exceed  $1 (a > 1)$  by short selling Asset 1 (short position on Asset 1) and acquiring Asset 2; similarly,  $\alpha$  may exceed  $0 (a < 0)$  by short selling Asset 2 (short position on Asset 2) and acquiring the Asset.

In the plan  $\left(\sigma_P^2;\mu_P\right)$  the opportunities frontier  $(\mathcal{B})$  is defined by all portfolios on the basis of the following coordinates:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \mu_ {P} = (1 - \alpha) \mu_ {1} + \alpha \mu_ {2} \\ \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \alpha^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \alpha (1 - \alpha) \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \end{array} \right. \tag {5.49}
$$

These Eq. (5.49) define the system of parametric equations of the opportunity frontier  $(\mathcal{B})$  and they allow for definition of the coordinates of each portfolio by changing  $\alpha$  (Castellani et al. 2005).

It is important to note that the opportunities frontier  $(\mathcal{B})$  can be obtained by explicating the portfolio variance  $\left(\sigma_P^2\right)$  as function of its return  $(\mu_P)$ . To do this, it is necessary to explicate the first equation (portfolio's return) of Eq. (5.49) for  $\alpha$  and substituting it in the second equation (portfolio variance).

Therefore, the first equation can be explicated by  $\alpha$  as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mu_ {P} = (1 - \alpha) \mu_ {1} + \alpha \mu_ {2} \\ \mu_ {P} = \mu_ {1} - \alpha \mu_ {1} + \alpha \mu_ {2} \quad \rightarrow \alpha = \frac {\mu_ {P} - \mu_ {1}}{\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}} \\ \mu_ {P} - \mu_ {1} = \alpha \left(\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

By substituting  $\alpha$  in Eq. (5.11), the portfolio variance can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \alpha^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + (1 - \alpha) ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \alpha (1 - \alpha) \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \left(\frac {\mu_ {P} - \mu_ {1}}{\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}\right) ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \left(1 - \frac {\mu_ {P} - \mu_ {1}}{\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}\right) ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \left(\frac {\mu_ {P} - \mu_ {1}}{\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}\right) \left(1 - \frac {\mu_ {P} - \mu_ {1}}{\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}\right) \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}
$$

$$

$$

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \left(\frac {\mu_ {P} - \mu_ {1}}{\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}\right) ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \left(\frac {\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {P}}{\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}\right) ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \left(\frac {\mu_ {P} - \mu_ {1}}{\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}\right) \left(\frac {\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {P}}{\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}\right) \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \left(\frac {\mu_ {P} - \mu_ {1}}{\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}\right) ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \left(\frac {\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {P}}{\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}}\right) ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \left(\frac {\mu_ {P} \mu_ {2} - \mu_ {P} ^ {2} - \mu_ {1} \mu_ {2} + \mu_ {1} \mu_ {P}}{(\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}) ^ {2}}\right) \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{(\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}) ^ {2}} \left[ (\mu_ {P} - \mu_ {1}) ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + (\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {P}) ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 (\mu_ {P} \mu_ {2} - \mu_ {P} ^ {2} - \mu_ {1} \mu_ {2} + \mu_ {1} \mu_ {P}) \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \right]
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{(\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}) ^ {2}} \left[ \mu_ {P} ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \mu_ {1} ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} - 2 \mu_ {P} \mu_ {1} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \mu_ {2} ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \mu_ {P} ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - 2 \mu_ {P} \mu_ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + 2 \mu_ {P} \mu_ {2} \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \right. \\ - 2 \mu_ {P} ^ {2} \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} - 2 \mu_ {1} \mu_ {2} \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} + 2 \mu_ {1} \mu_ {P} \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} ] \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{(\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}) ^ {2}} \left[ \mu_ {P} ^ {2} \left(\sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - 2 \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}\right) \right. \\ - 2 \mu_ {P} \left[ \mu_ {1} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \mu_ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} (\mu_ {2} + \mu_ {1}) \right] + \mu_ {1} ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \mu_ {2} ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - 2 \mu_ {1} \mu_ {2} \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} ] \\ \end{array}
$$

By placing:

$$
A = \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - 2 \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}
$$

$$
B = 2 \left[ \mu_ {1} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \mu_ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} (\mu_ {2} + \mu_ {1}) \right]
$$

$$
C = \mu_ {1} ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \mu_ {2} ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} - 2 \mu_ {1} \mu_ {2} \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}
$$

We have:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{\left(\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}\right) ^ {2}} \left[ \mathrm {A} \mu_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} - \mathrm {B} \mu_ {\mathrm {P}} + \mathrm {C} \right] \tag {5.50}
$$

and in terms of standard deviation, we have:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} = \frac {1}{\left(\mu_ {2} - \mu_ {1}\right)} \sqrt {\mathrm {A} \mu_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} - \mathrm {B} \mu_ {\mathrm {P}} + \mathrm {C}} \tag {5.51}
$$

In the plane  $\left(\mu_P;\sigma_P^2\right)$  Eq. (5.50) draws a parabola with its axis parallel to the axis of ordinates and concave upwards (Saltari 2011).

Note, by considering the function linearity, explicating the portfolio's variance  $\left(\sigma_P^2\right)$  as a function of its return  $(\mu_P)$  (so that  $\sigma_P^2 = A\mu_P^2 + B\mu_P + C$ ) instead of as

function of  $\alpha$  (so that  $\sigma_P^2 = A\alpha^2 + B\alpha + C$ ) it is simply equivalent to create a linear transformation of the abscissas.

Reversing the axes, and therefore in the plane  $\left(\sigma_P^2;\mu_P\right)$ , Eq. (5.50) draws a parabola with its axis parallel to the axis abscissa and concavity towards the right. This parabola defines the opportunity frontier  $(\mathcal{B})$ .

Assuming a well-diversified portfolio  $\left(0 < \rho_{1,2} < \frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}\right)$  the parabola can be represented as in Fig. 5.9 (adapted from Castellani et al. 2005).

The parabola in Fig. 5.9 represents the opportunities frontier  $(\mathcal{B})$  and it contains all efficient portfolios obtained on the basis of a combination of the two assets by changing the  $\alpha$ .

It is worth noting that, assuming that there are no shorts selling, the curve is delimited by the portfolios composed of Asset 1 only (portfolio  $A_{1}$  created by  $\alpha = 0$ ) and only by Asset 2 (portfolio  $A_{2}$  achieved by  $\alpha = 1$ ). All others portfolios, based on the combination of the two assets, move along the curve.

Otherwise, assuming that there are shorts selling, for the negative value of  $\alpha$  and therefore for  $(\alpha < 0)$ , the portfolio  $A_{1}$  is exceeded through the short selling of Asset 2 and acquiring of Asset 1. At the same time, for the positive value of  $\alpha$  and therefore for  $(\alpha > 1)$ , portfolio  $A_{2}$  is exceeded through the short selling of Asset 1 and acquisition of Asset 2.

Assuming that there is no short selling and therefore for  $(0\leq \alpha \leq 1)$ , all efficient portfolios are positioned on the parabola. Therefore, the curve represents the frontier of minimum variance portfolio for each defined level of portfolio expected return  $(\mu_{\mathrm{P}})$ . Consequently, having defined the level of the portfolio's expected

return, by moving along the curve and by changing the composition of the portfolio as function of  $\alpha$ , it is possible to minimize the portfolio's variance  $\left(\sigma_P^2\right)$ .

Note all portfolios on the opportunity frontier  $(\mathcal{B})$ , and therefore on the frontier of minimum variance portfolios, can be considered as Pareto optimality. All portfolios positioned on the parabola lower branch are dominated by the portfolios positioned on the parabola upper branch: they are defined as dominant portfolios because they are characterized by a higher expected return for equal risk level.

The point of transition on the curve from dominant portfolio to dominated portfolios is represented by the minimum variance portfolio  $(\alpha^{*})$

The  $\alpha^{*}$  defines the part of wealth to be invested in Asset 2 (riskier asset) to minimize the portfolio's variance. Therefore,  $\alpha^{*}$  the weight of Asset 2 and therefore the weight of Asset 1, in the portfolio in order to obtain the minimum variance portfolio.

Therefore, from the minimum variance portfolio, the parabola upper branch is concave while the parabola lower branch is convex. Only the parabola upper branch defines the frontier of efficient portfolios, because only these portfolios are really efficient. In Fig. 5.9 the frontier of efficient portfolios is defined by part of the curve  $(\alpha^{*};A_{2})$ .

Therefore, the subset of the minimum variance portfolios is larger than the efficient portfolios and therefore the frontier of minimum variance portfolios contains the frontier of efficient portfolios. In this sense, it is sufficient to analyse the position of portfolio  $C$  and of portfolio  $B$ . Both portfolios are positioned on the parabola and therefore on the frontier of minimum variance portfolios. But only portfolio  $C$  can be defined as an efficient portfolio because for the same variance  $\left(\sigma_{C}^{2} = \sigma_{B}^{2}\right)$  its expected return is higher than the portfolio  $B \left(\sigma_{C}^{2} = \sigma_{B}^{2}\right)$ ; therefore, portfolio  $C$  dominates portfolio  $B$ . Consequently, both portfolios are positioned on the frontier of minimum variance portfolios but only portfolio  $C$  is positioned on the frontier of efficient portfolios. Only the portfolios on the frontier of the efficient portfolios can be defined as Pareto optimality.

Therefore, having defined the frontier of minimum variance portfolios it is necessary to focus the analysis on the frontier of efficient portfolios where the efficient portfolios are positioned, starting from the minimum variance portfolio. All points:

- above the frontier of efficient portfolios: represent portfolios that cannot be obtained due to the statistical characteristics of the assets in portfolios;
- below the frontier of efficient portfolios: represent portfolios that can be obtained on the basis of the statistical characteristics of the assets in portfolios, but they are not efficient and therefore they are dominated by the portfolios positioned on the efficient frontier.

The frontier of efficient portfolios represents the solution of the optimization problem in the mean-variance criteria. The efficient portfolios show the lower variance for the same expected return level or, equivalently, the higher return for the same variance level.

Fig. 5.10 The opportunity frontier  $(\mathcal{B})$  in the plane  $(\sigma_{\mathrm{P}};\mu_{\mathrm{P}})$

It is worth noting that the construction of the frontier of efficient portfolios is a function of the investor's expectations about the statistical characteristics (mean, variance and covariance) of the assets in portfolios. Consequently, each investor works on his frontier of efficient portfolios.

Moving from the portfolio's variance  $\left(\sigma_P^2\right)$  to its standard deviation  $(\sigma_{P})$ , in the plane  $(\sigma_P;\mu_P)$  the opportunity frontier  $(\mathcal{B})$  can be represented as the form of a hyperbola branch with concavity towards the right which increases with the decrease of the correlation coefficient, as shown in Fig. 5.10.

Note that the portfolio  $R$  can be obtained as follows:

$$
\alpha_ {R} = \frac {\sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}} \tag {5.52}
$$

On the basis of the  $\alpha_{\mathrm{R}}$  the expected return of the portfolio  $R$  can be achieved, as follows:

$$
\mu_ {R} = (1 - \alpha_ {R}) \mu_ {1} + \alpha_ {R} \mu_ {2}
$$

$$
\mu_ {R} = \left(1 - \frac {\sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}}\right) \mu_ {1} + \frac {\sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}} \mu_ {2}
$$

$$
\mu_ {R} = \left(\frac {\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2} - \sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}}\right) \mu_ {1} + \frac {\sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}} \mu_ {2}
$$

$$
\mu_ {R} = \frac {\sigma_ {2}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}} \mu_ {1} + \frac {\sigma_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1} + \sigma_ {2}} \mu_ {2} \tag {5.53}
$$

# Case 2) N Risky Assets in Portfolio

At this point, it is possible to analyse (Case 2) by assuming  $N$  risky assets in portfolio. Also, if the problem is more complex, the result is similar to the one of (Case 1).

In order to define the optimal portfolio, it is necessary to distinguish between two cases:

short selling is permitted;
short selling is not permitted.

If the short selling is permitted (it is the most relevant situation) there are no restraints on  $\alpha$  considered; therefore, it can be positive or negative due to the short selling. Since the correlations between the assets' expected returns tend to be different from zero, and the positive correlation tens to be greater than negative correlation, the short selling is used according to portfolio optimization.

In this context, definition of the efficient portfolio can be defined as a constrained optimization problem, as follows (Castellani et al. 2005):

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \min  _ {\boldsymbol {\alpha} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {n}} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} (\boldsymbol {\alpha}) \\ \mu_ {P} (\boldsymbol {\alpha}) = \mu_ {0} \\ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {k} = 1 \end{array} \right. \tag {5.54}
$$

Or alternatively:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \max  _ {\boldsymbol {\alpha} \in \mathbb {R} ^ {n}} \mu_ {P} (\boldsymbol {\alpha}) \\ \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} (\boldsymbol {\alpha}) = \sigma_ {0} ^ {2} \\ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {k} = 1 \end{array} \right. \tag {5.55}
$$

where in Eq. (5.54) the first is the equation to be minimized and the second and the third are the constraints, and also in Eq. (5.55) the first is the equation to be maximized and the second and third are the constraints. In both cases,  $\alpha$  is a vector:  $\alpha = \{\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\ldots ,\alpha_{k}\}$ .

Considering that investors are characterized by the risk aversion, the constrained optimization problem is usually formalized on the basis of Eq. (5.54) rather than on the basis of Eq. (5.55).

In the extensive form, Eq. (5.54) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \min  _ {\alpha \in \mathbb {R} ^ {n}} \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {k} \alpha_ {j} \rho_ {k, j} \sigma_ {k} \sigma_ {j} \\ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {k} \mu_ {k} = \mu_ {0} \\ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {k} = 1 \end{array} \right. \tag {5.56}
$$

Equation (5.56) can be solved by using the Lagrangian  $(\mathcal{L})$  as follows (Castellani et al. 2005):

# 5.2 Efficient Frontier

$$
\mathcal {L} = \sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \rho_ {\mathrm {k}, \mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {j}} - \lambda^ {\prime} \left(\sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} \mu_ {\mathrm {k}} - \mu_ {0}\right) - \lambda^ {\prime \prime} \left(\sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} - 1\right) \tag {5.57}
$$

Remembering that in Eqs. (5.45), (5.46) and (5.48), we have:

$$
\frac {\partial \mu_ {\mathrm {P}}}{\partial \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}}} = \frac {\partial}{\partial \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}}} \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \mu_ {\mathrm {j}} = \mu_ {\mathrm {k}}
$$

$$
\frac {\partial \sigma_ {P} ^ {2}}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} = \frac {\partial}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \sum_ {h = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {j} \alpha_ {h} \sigma_ {j, h} = 2 \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k, j}
$$

$$
\frac {\partial \sigma_ {P}}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} = \frac {1}{2 \sigma_ {P}} \frac {\partial \sigma_ {P} ^ {2}}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} = \frac {\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k j}}{\sigma_ {P}}
$$

and by considering the Legrangian first derivative:

$$
\frac {\partial \mathcal {L}}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} = 2 \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {j} \rho_ {k, j} \sigma_ {j} - \lambda^ {\prime} \mu_ {k} - \lambda^ {\prime \prime} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {j} \rho_ {k, j} \sigma_ {j} - \frac {1}{2} \lambda^ {\prime} \mu_ {k} - \frac {1}{2} \lambda^ {\prime \prime} \tag {5.58}
$$

and placing first derivatives first, we have:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {j} \rho_ {k, j} \sigma_ {j} - \frac {1}{2} \lambda^ {\prime} \mu_ {k} - \frac {1}{2} \lambda^ {\prime \prime} = 0 \quad p e r \quad k = 1, 2, \dots , n \\ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {k} \mu_ {k} = \mu_ {0} \\ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} w _ {k} = 1 \end{array} \right. \tag {5.59}
$$

Equation (5.59) are linear. Denoting by  $\alpha_{1}(\mu_{0}),\alpha_{2}(\mu_{0}),\ldots ,\alpha_{n}(\mu_{0})$  the solutions obtained at the fixed value of the portfolio's expected return  $(\mu_0)$ , we have the coordinates of the minimum variance portfolio as follows (Castellani et al. 2005):

$$
\mu_ {0} = \sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} \left(\mu_ {0}\right) \mu_ {\mathrm {k}} \tag {5.60}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {0} ^ {2} = \sum_ {\mathrm {k} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \sum_ {\mathrm {j} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {n}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {k}} \left(\mu_ {0}\right) \alpha_ {\mathrm {j}} \left(\mu_ {0}\right) \rho_ {\mathrm {k}, \mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {k}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {j}} \tag {5.61}
$$

The coordinates of the minimum variance portfolio are obtained by solving the constrained optimization problem through the Lagrangian without any constraint on the expected return.

In the plane  $\left(\mu_{\mathrm{P}};\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}^{2}\right)$ , we have a parabola with axes parallel to the abscissa and concavity to the right as shown in Fig. 5.11. All assets are positioned in the space

delimited by the parabola. The curve represents the opportunity frontier  $(\mathcal{B})$  in case of n risky assets and when short selling is permitted. The parabola's vertex indicates the minimum variance portfolio, as follows (Castellani et al. 2005):

$$
\sigma_ {*} ^ {2} = \min  _ {\mathrm {w} \in \mathcal {B}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {p}} ^ {2} (\alpha) \tag {5.62}
$$

where  $\pmb{\alpha}$  is a vector as follows:  $\pmb {\alpha} = \{a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{n}\}$

Similarly to the previous case, the efficient frontier is represented by the parabola's superior branch starting from the minimum variance portfolio.

Shifting the focus from the plane  $\left(\sigma_P^2, \mu_P\right)$  to the plane  $(\sigma_P, \mu_P)$ , the opportunity frontier goes from hyperbolic to hyperbole with the axes parallel to the abscissa and the point of axle intersection on the ordinate, as shown in Fig. 5.12.

# 5.2 Efficient Frontier

If short selling is not permitted, the opportunity frontier is defined only based on the assets owned. In this case, the constrained optimization problem can be defined as follows (Castellani et al. 2005):

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \min  _ {w \in \mathbb {R} ^ {n}} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} (\alpha) \\ \mu_ {P} (\alpha) = \mu_ {0} \\ \sum_ {k = 1} ^ {n} w \alpha_ {k} = 1 \\ \alpha_ {k} \geq 0 \quad k = 1, 2, \dots , n \end{array} \right. \tag {5.63}
$$

where  $\pmb{\alpha}$  is a vector as follows:  $\pmb {\alpha} = \{a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{n}\}$

The problem does not have an analytical solution. The opportunity frontier is obtained through numerical procedures.

# (Case 3) N Risky Assets in Portfolio and One Risk-Free Asset

Finally, the last case (Case 3) assumes  $N$  risky assets in portfolio and one risk-free asset.

Introduction of the asset free-risk in the portfolio, allows for simplification of the problem of the portfolio optimisation. Indeed, in this case the efficient frontier is represented by a straight-line and not by a curve.

Assuming a portfolio consisting of  $N$  risky assets  $(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\dots,\alpha_{n})$  and one risk-free asset  $(\alpha_0)$ . Assuming that it is a zero-coupon bond issued in t-time and maturity in s-time. Denoting by  $Q_{0}$  the price of the risk-free asset in t-time and by  $A_0$  the price of the risk-free asset in s-time, it returns  $(R_F)$  (that it is sure and not expected), it is equal to:

$$
R _ {F} = \frac {A _ {0} - Q _ {0}}{Q _ {0}} = \frac {A _ {0}}{Q _ {0}} - 1 \tag {5.64}
$$

Considering that the asset is risk-free, the price  $A_0$  is known in t-time and therefore, the return  $R_f$  is sure and not expected.

The risky asset  $(a_{k})$  requires an expected return  $(\mu_k)$  higher than the risk-free asset return, so that:

$$
\mu_ {k} \gg R _ {F}
$$

The difference between the  $\mu_{k}$  and  $R_{F}$  is the extra-return expected by investors for the risk burden, and therefore the risk premium  $(\delta_{\mathrm{k}})$  required by investor for the risk:

$$
\delta_ {\mathrm {k}} = \mu_ {\mathrm {k}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} \tag {5.65}
$$

Considering two assets in the portfolio: (i) risky asset  $(A_{1})$  and (ii) risk-free asset  $(A_0)$ . The expected return of the risky asset is equal to  $\mu_{1}$  and the sure return of the risk-free asset is equal to  $R_{F}$ . Denoting the part of wealth invested in the risky asset

by  $\alpha$ , and the part of wealth invested in the risk-free asset by  $(1 - \alpha)$ , the portfolio's expected return  $(\mu_P)$  can be calculated as follows:

$$
\mu_ {P} = \alpha \mu_ {1} + (1 - \alpha) R _ {F}
$$

and therefore:

$$
\mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \alpha \left(\mu_ {1} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}}\right) \tag {5.66}
$$

Considering that the variance of the risk-free asset is equal to zero  $\left(\sigma_{i}^{2} = 0\right)$  by definition (its return is certain), the portfolio's variance  $\left(\sigma_{P}^{2}\right)$  is equal to:

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \alpha^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + (1 - \alpha) \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + 2 \alpha (1 - \alpha) \sigma_ {1, 2}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \sigma_ {\mathrm {l}} ^ {2} \alpha^ {2} \tag {5.67}
$$

The portfolio's variance is positive. Therefore, it is possible to move from the variance to the standard deviation directly as follows:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} = \sigma_ {1} \alpha \tag {5.68}
$$

It is possible to define the portfolio's expected return  $(\mu_P)$  as function of its standard deviation. By solving Eq. (5.68) by  $\alpha$  and substituting in Eq. (5.66) we have:

$$
\alpha = \frac {\sigma_ {P}}{\sigma_ {1}}
$$

$$
\mu_ {P} = R _ {F} + \frac {\sigma_ {P}}{\sigma_ {1}} \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}\right)
$$

and therefore:

$$
\mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} \left(\frac {\mu_ {1} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}}}{\sigma_ {1}}\right) \tag {5.69}
$$

Equation (5.69) draws a straight-line in the space  $(\sigma_P; \mu_P)$  where interception is equal to  $(R_F)$  and slope is equal to  $\left(\frac{\mu_1 - R_F}{\sigma_1}\right)$ , as shown in Fig. 5.13.

All possible combinations between the risky assets (and therefore the risky portfolio) and the risk-free asset are pointed on the straight-line. Therefore, it is the efficient frontier where:

- on the left of the point  $A_{1}$ , all combinations between the risk-free asset and the n-risky assets defining the risky portfolio are highlighted;

# 5.2 Efficient Frontier

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/87fea16b-33f6-43ec-8056-5ef3565ac4c2/7a74e2aef5e833e3b744b82ea2ee04ed84cc06b119baf019aba5b514c25ceaee.jpg)
Fig. 5.13 The opportunity frontier for n risky assets and one risk-free asset in portfolio in the plane  $(\sigma_{\mathrm{P}},\mu_{\mathrm{P}})$

- on the right of the point  $A_{1}$ , all combinations created by borrowing at a risk-free rate and therefore through short selling of the risk-free asset are highlighted (Elton et al. 2013).

Note that on the basis of Eq. (5.65), Eq. (5.69) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\delta_ {1} = \mu_ {1} - R _ {F}
$$

$$
\mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} \left(\frac {\delta_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1}}\right) \tag {5.70}
$$

The ratio between the risk premium  $(\delta_{1})$  and the standard deviation of the risky asset  $(a_{1})$  is the Sharpe index  $(\pi)$ :

$$
\frac {\mu_ {1} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {f}}}{\sigma_ {1}} = \frac {\delta_ {1}}{\sigma_ {1}} = \pi \tag {5.71}
$$

In general terms, by considering the k-th risky asset, the Sharpe index can be expressed on the basis of the variance of the risky asset as follows:

$$
\frac {\delta_ {k}}{\sigma_ {k} ^ {2}} = \pi \tag {5.72}
$$

The Sharpe index can be considered as the cost of capital for unit of risk or, in equivalent term, unit price for risk.

Based on the Share index, Eq. (5.70) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {f}} + \pi \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} \tag {5.73}
$$

Equation (5.73) defines the line of the efficient frontier.

The efficient frontier can be defined analytically (Saltari 2011). Assuming a portfolio  $P$  of two risky assets,  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$ , and one risk-free asset  $(A_0)$ . The expected returns of the risky assets are equal to  $\mu_{1}$  and  $\mu_{2}$  respectively while the sure return of the risk-free asset is equal to  $R_{F}$ . The part of wealth invested in the risk-free asset is equal to  $\alpha_{0}$ , while the part of wealth invested in the risky assets is equal to  $\alpha_{1}$  and  $\alpha_{2}$ . The budget constraint can be defined as follows:

$$
\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i} = 1 \rightarrow \alpha_ {0} + \alpha_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} = 1 \tag {5.74}
$$

The portfolio's expected return is equal to:

$$
\mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \alpha_ {0} \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \alpha_ {1} \mu_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} \mu_ {2} \tag {5.75}
$$

Considering only two variables,  $\alpha_{1}$  and  $\alpha_{2}$ , it is possible to define  $\alpha_{0}$  as function of  $\alpha_{1}$  and  $\alpha_{2}$  as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \alpha_ {0} = 1 - \alpha_ {1} \rightarrow \alpha_ {0} R _ {F} + \alpha_ {1} \mu_ {1} = (1 - \alpha_ {1}) R _ {F} + \alpha_ {1} \mu_ {1} \\ = R _ {F} - \alpha_ {1} R _ {F} + \alpha_ {1} \mu_ {1} = R _ {F} + \alpha_ {1} \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}\right) \tag {5.76} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \alpha_ {0} = 1 - \alpha_ {2} \rightarrow \alpha_ {0} R _ {F} + \alpha_ {2} \mu_ {2} = (1 - \alpha_ {2}) R _ {F} + \alpha_ {2} \mu_ {2} \\ = R _ {F} - \alpha_ {2} R _ {F} + \alpha_ {2} \mu_ {2} = R _ {F} + \alpha_ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} - R _ {F}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

And therefore Eq. (5.75) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\mu_ {P} = R _ {F} + \alpha_ {1} \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}\right) + \alpha_ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} - R _ {F}\right) \tag {5.77}
$$

For a given expected return the minimum variance portfolio can be obtained by solving a optimization constrained problems as follows:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \min  _ {\alpha_ {1}, \alpha_ {2}} \frac {1}{2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{2} \left(\alpha_ {1} ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \alpha_ {2} ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + 2 \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \alpha_ {1} \alpha_ {2}\right) \\ \mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \alpha_ {1} \left(\mu_ {1} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}}\right) + \alpha_ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}}\right) \\ \alpha_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} = 1 \end{array} \right. \tag {5.78}
$$

where the first equation is the equation to be minimized, while the second and the third equations are the constraints.

It is worth noting, that the use of half of the variance  $\left(\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}^{2}\right)$  instead of the variance  $\left(\sigma_{\mathrm{P}}^{2}\right)$  is used only to simplify calculations (Saltari 2011).

By using the Lagrangia  $(\mathcal{L})$  , we have:

$$
\mathcal {L} = \frac {1}{2} \sigma^ {2} + \lambda \left[ \mu_ {P} - \left(R _ {F} + \alpha_ {1} \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}\right) + \alpha_ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} - R _ {F}\right)\right) \right]
$$

# 5.2 Efficient Frontier

and therefore:

$$
\mathcal {L} = \frac {1}{2} \left(\alpha_ {1} ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \alpha_ {2} ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + 2 \rho_ {1, 2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \alpha_ {1} \alpha_ {2}\right) + \lambda \left[ \mu_ {P} - \left(R _ {F} + \alpha_ {1} \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}\right) + \alpha_ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} - R _ {F}\right)\right) \right] \tag {5.79}
$$

Placing the derivatives of the Lagrangian equal to zero with respect  $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}$  and  $\lambda$  we have:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{c} \frac {\partial \mathcal {L}}{\partial \alpha_ {1}} = \alpha_ {1} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \alpha_ {2} - \lambda \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {\mathrm {f}}\right) = 0 \\ \frac {\partial \mathcal {L}}{\partial \alpha_ {2}} = \alpha_ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \alpha_ {1} - \lambda \left(\mu_ {2} - R _ {\mathrm {f}}\right) = 0 \\ \frac {\partial \mathcal {L}}{\partial \lambda} = \mu - \left[ R _ {\mathrm {f}} + \alpha_ {1} \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {\mathrm {f}}\right) + \alpha_ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} - R _ {\mathrm {f}}\right) \right] = 0 \end{array} \right. \tag {5.80}
$$

To solve the system of Eq. (5.80) it is possible to multiply the first equation for  $\alpha_{1}$ , as well as the second equation for  $\alpha_{2}$ , and to add the two equations together.

Therefore, by multiplying the first equation for  $\alpha_{1}$  and the second equation for  $\alpha_{2}$ , we have:

$$
\left[ \alpha_ {1} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \alpha_ {2} - \lambda (\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}) \right] \alpha_ {1} = 0 \rightarrow \alpha_ {1} ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \alpha_ {2} \alpha_ {1} - \lambda (\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}) \alpha_ {1} = 0
$$

$$
\left[ \alpha_ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \alpha_ {1} - \lambda (\mu_ {2} - R _ {F}) \right] \alpha_ {2} = 0 \rightarrow \alpha_ {2} ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \alpha_ {1} \alpha_ {2} - \lambda (\mu_ {2} - R _ {F}) \alpha_ {2} = 0
$$

By adding two equations, we have:

$$
\alpha_ {1} ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \alpha_ {2} ^ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + 2 \rho_ {1, 2} \alpha_ {1} \alpha_ {2} \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} = \lambda \left[ \alpha_ {1} \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}\right) + \alpha_ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} - R _ {F}\right) \right]
$$

The left side of the equation is the portfolio's variance  $\left(\sigma_P^2\right)$  due to the risky assets.

Considering that:

$$
\alpha_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} = 1 \leftrightarrow \mu_ {1} + \mu_ {2} = \mu
$$

the right side of the equation is equal to the product between  $\lambda$  and the difference between the portfolio's expected return due to the risky assets  $(\mu)$  and the sure return of the risk-free asset  $(R_F)$ , as follows:

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \lambda (\mu - R _ {F}) \rightarrow \lambda = \frac {\sigma_ {P} ^ {2}}{(\mu - R _ {F})}
$$

Now it is possible to solve the first and the second equations of the system of Eq. (5.80) for  $\alpha_{1}$  and  $\alpha_{2}$ . Substituting  $\lambda$  in the first equation, we have:

$$
\alpha_ {1} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \alpha_ {2} - \frac {\sigma_ {P} ^ {2}}{(\mu - R _ {F})} (\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}) = 0
$$

$$
\alpha_ {1} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} (\mu - R _ {F}) + \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \alpha_ {2} (\mu - R _ {F}) - \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} (\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}) = 0
$$

$$
\alpha_ {1} = \frac {\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} (\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}) - \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \alpha_ {2} (\mu - R _ {F})}{\sigma_ {1} ^ {2} (\mu - R _ {F})}
$$

$$
\alpha_ {1} = \frac {\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}\right)}{\sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \left(\mu - R _ {F}\right)} - \frac {\rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \alpha_ {2} \left(\mu - R _ {F}\right)}{\sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \left(\mu - R _ {F}\right)}
$$

$$
\alpha_ {1} = \frac {\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} (\mu_ {1} - R _ {F})}{\sigma_ {1} ^ {2} (\mu - R _ {F})} - \frac {\rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \alpha_ {2}}{\sigma_ {1} ^ {2}}
$$

Substituting  $\lambda$  and  $\alpha_{1}$  in the second equation, we have:

$$
\alpha_ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \left[ \frac {\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} (\mu_ {1} - R _ {F})}{\sigma_ {1} ^ {2} (\mu - R _ {F})} - \frac {\rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \alpha_ {2}}{\sigma_ {1} ^ {2}} \right] - \frac {\sigma_ {P} ^ {2}}{\mu - R _ {F}} (\mu_ {2} - R _ {F}) = 0
$$

$$

$$

$$

$$

$$

$$

$$

and remembering that:

$$
\lambda = \frac {\sigma_ {P} ^ {2}}{\mu - R _ {0}}
$$

and placing:

$$
\Delta = \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} (1 - \rho^ {2})
$$

# 5.2 Efficient Frontier

Defined the value of  $\alpha_{1}$  and  $\alpha_{2}$ , and by substituting it in the budget constraint we have the efficient frontier. Specifically, the budget constraint is equal to:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mu - R _ {F} = \frac {\sigma^ {2}}{(\mu - R _ {F})} \frac {1}{\Delta} \left(\mathrm {A R} _ {\mathrm {F}} ^ {2} - 2 \mathrm {B R} _ {F} + \mathrm {C}\right) \\ \left(\mu - R _ {F}\right) ^ {2} = \frac {\sigma^ {2}}{\Delta} \left(\mathrm {A R} _ {\mathrm {F}} ^ {2} - 2 \mathrm {B R} _ {F} + \mathrm {C}\right) \\ \left(\mu - R _ {F}\right) ^ {2} = \sigma^ {2} \frac {\mathrm {A R} _ {\mathrm {F}} ^ {2} - 2 \mathrm {B R} _ {F} + \mathrm {C}}{\Delta} \\ \mu - R _ {F} = \pm \sqrt {\sigma^ {2} \frac {\mathrm {A R} _ {\mathrm {F}} ^ {2} - 2 \mathrm {B R} _ {F} + \mathrm {C}}{\Delta}} \\ \mu = R _ {F} \pm \sigma \sqrt {\frac {\mathrm {A R} _ {\mathrm {F}} ^ {2} - 2 \mathrm {B R} _ {F} + \mathrm {C}}{\Delta}} \tag {5.81} \\ \end{array}
$$

Equation (5.81) is the equation of the efficient frontier (Saltari 2011).

It is important to note that the equation  $\mu = R_f + \frac{\mu_T - R_f}{\sigma_T}\Delta \sigma$  is similar (not considering the negative sign) to the equation of the efficient frontier.

Therefore, by considering one risk-free asset in portfolio, we have two lines with a common interception equal to  $R_{F}$  and slope equal to  $\sigma_{P}$  in absolute terms, as shown in Fig. 5.14 (adapted from Saltari 2011).

In Fig. 5.14 only the line with a positive slope  $(R_{F}T)$  defines the efficient frontier by considering  $N$  risky assets and one free-risk asset. Also, the line that originates from  $R_{F}$  and passes through the point  $T$ , defining the efficiency line.

The points between  $R_{F}$  and  $T$  represent all possible solutions of the trade-off between risk and return by changing the part of wealth invested in the portfolio of risky assets and in the risk-free asset.

The points over point  $T$  obtained by the fixed rate debt (or equivalently, by short selling the risk-free asset and acquiring the risky assets).

Generally, each portfolio on the lines  $TR_{F}E$  can be obtained by linear combination of the risk-free asset and the tangent portfolio  $(T)$  consisting of risky assets (Saltari 2011). Specifically:

- in the point  $T$ , all wealth is invested in the two risky assets, and therefore  $\alpha_0 = 0$ ;
- in the point  $R_F$ , all wealth is invested in the risk-free, and therefore  $\alpha_0 = 1$
- to the right of the point  $T$ , short selling of the risk-free asset occurs and acquisition of the risky assets with an increase in the portfolio risk;

Fig. 5.14 The efficient frontier for a risk-free asset in portfolio

- in the section  $R_{F}E$ , there is short selling of the risky assets and acquisition of the risk-free asset, and therefore  $\alpha_0 > 1$ .

In point  $T$ , all wealth is invested in the risky assets. Therefore, there is no risk-free asset in the portfolio, and therefore  $\alpha_0 = 0$  and consequently the budget constraint is equal to  $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = 1$ .

Based on this condition, it is possible to estimate the expected return and the variance of the tangent portfolio  $(T)$  (Saltari 2011).

Remembering that:

$$
\alpha_ {1} = \frac {\lambda}{\Delta} \left[ \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}\right) - \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} - R _ {F}\right) \right]
$$

and

$$
\alpha_ {2} = \frac {\lambda}{\Delta} \left[ \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} - R _ {F}\right) - \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}\right) \right]
$$

and adding the two equations, we have:

$$
\alpha_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} = \frac {\lambda}{\Delta} \left[ \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}\right) + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} - R _ {F}\right) - \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} - R _ {F}\right) - \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}\right) \right]
$$

# 5.2 Efficient Frontier

and therefore:

$$
\alpha_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} = \frac {\lambda}{\Delta} \left[ \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}\right) + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} - R _ {F}\right) - \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} - R _ {F} + \mu_ {1} - R _ {F}\right) \right]
$$

$$
\alpha_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} = \frac {\lambda}{\Delta} \left[ \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} \left(\mu_ {1} - R _ {F}\right) + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} - R _ {F}\right) - \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \left(\mu_ {2} + \mu_ {1} - 2 R _ {F}\right) \right]
$$

$$
\alpha_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} = \frac {\lambda}{\Delta} \left[ \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} \mu_ {1} - \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} R _ {F} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \mu_ {2} - \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} R _ {F} - \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} (\mu_ {1} + \mu_ {2}) + \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} 2 R _ {F} \right]
$$

$$
\alpha_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} = \frac {\lambda}{\Delta} \left[ \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} \mu_ {1} + \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \mu_ {2} - \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} (\mu_ {1} + \mu_ {2}) - R _ {f} \left(\sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} - 2 \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2}\right) \right]
$$

Remembering that:

$$
\begin{array}{l} A = \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} - 2 \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} \\ B = \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} \mu_ {2} + \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} \mu_ {1} - \rho \sigma_ {1} \sigma_ {2} (\mu_ {1} + \mu_ {2}) \\ \alpha_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} = 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

and replacing it, we have:

$$
1 = \frac {\lambda}{\Delta} (B - A R _ {F})
$$

Therefore, it is possible to obtain the value of the Lagrangian multiplier  $(\lambda)$  for the portfolio  $T$  as follows:

$$
\lambda = \frac {\Delta}{B - A R _ {F}}
$$

Substituting  $\lambda$  in the equation, we have:

$$
\mu - R _ {F} = \frac {\lambda}{\Delta} \left(A R _ {F} ^ {2} - 2 B R _ {F} + C\right)
$$

and therefore the expected return of the tangent portfolio  $(\mu_T)$  is equal to:

$$
\mu_ {T} - R _ {F} = \frac {1}{\Delta} \frac {\Delta}{B - A R _ {F}} \left(A R _ {F} ^ {2} - 2 B R _ {F} + C\right)
$$

and therefore:

$$
\mu_ {\mathrm {T}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} = \frac {1}{\mathrm {B} - \mathrm {A R} _ {\mathrm {F}}} \left(\mathrm {A R} _ {\mathrm {F}} ^ {2} - 2 \mathrm {B R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \mathrm {C}\right) \tag {5.82}
$$

The variance of the tangent portfolio  $\left(\sigma_T^2\right)$  is obtained by substituting the value  $\left(\mu_T - R_f\right)$  in the equation:

$$
(\mu - R _ {F}) ^ {2} = \sigma^ {2} \frac {A R _ {F} ^ {2} - 2 B R _ {F} + C}{\Delta}
$$

and therefore:

$$
\left[ \frac {1}{B - A R _ {F}} \left(A R _ {F} ^ {2} - 2 B R _ {F} + C\right) \right] ^ {2} = \sigma^ {2} \frac {A R _ {F} ^ {2} - 2 B R _ {F} + C}{\Delta}
$$

and therefore:

$$
\sigma_ {T} ^ {2} = \frac {\left[ \frac {1}{B - A R _ {F}} \left(A R _ {F} ^ {2} - 2 B R _ {F} + C\right) \right] ^ {2}}{A R _ {F} ^ {2} - 2 B R _ {F} + C} \Delta
$$

$$
\sigma_ {T} ^ {2} = \frac {\left(A R _ {F} ^ {2} - 2 B R _ {F} + C\right) ^ {2}}{\left(B - A R _ {F}\right) ^ {2}} \Delta \tag {5.83}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {T} ^ {2} = \frac {\left(A R _ {F} ^ {2} - 2 B R _ {F} + C\right) ^ {2}}{\left(B - A R _ {F}\right) ^ {2}} \cdot \frac {\Delta}{A R _ {F} ^ {2} - 2 B R _ {F} + C}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {T}} ^ {2} = \Delta \frac {\mathrm {A R} _ {\mathrm {F}} ^ {2} - 2 \mathrm {B R} _ {F} + \mathrm {C}}{\left(\mathrm {B} - \mathrm {A R} _ {F}\right) ^ {2}}
$$

Therefore, the investor chooses a portfolio consisting of a risk-free asset and the tangent portfolio defined by the risky assets (Saltari 2011). Therefore, the efficient portfolio consists of a mix between the risk-free asset and the risky asset. Consequently, they are positioned in the part of the line between  $R_{F}$  and the tangenty portfolio  $(T)$ .

Finally, Fig. 5.14 shows that:

- the risky portfolio  $A$  is the minimum variance portfolio for all combinations between the risk-free asset and the risky assets on the line  $R_{F}A$ ;
- the risky portfolio  $B$ , for all combinations between the risk-free asset and the risky assets on the line  $R_{F}B$ ;
- the risky portfolio  $C$ , for all combinations between the risk-free asset and the risky assets on the line  $R_{F}C$ .

All combinations between the risk-free asset and the risky assets on the line  $R_{F}B$  are preferred to the combinations on the line  $R_{F}A$ , because a defined risk level gives higher returns.

At the same time, the combinations between the risk-free asset and the risky assets on the line  $R_{F}T$  are preferred to the combinations on the line  $R_{F}B$ , because a defined risk level gives higher returns.

Generally, with the slope increases of the line originating from  $\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{F}}$ , we have the best combination between the risk-free asset and the risky assets. The maximum slope possible is obtained from the tangent point between the line and the efficient

# 5.2 Efficient Frontier

frontier as in point  $(T)$ . As there are no portfolios above the efficient frontier due to the statistical characteristics of the assets, it follows there are no portfolios above the line that originates from  $\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{F}}$  and passing through  $(T)$  the efficient line.

Therefore, if the investor is risk adverse, the portfolio obtained by the combination between the risk-free asset and the risky asset  $(T)$  and therefore is positioned on the line  $R_{F}T$ . Otherwise, if the investor is inclined to risk, his portfolio is positioned on the line  $TD$  creating by borrowing at a risk-free rate and therefore by short selling the risk-free asset and acquiring the risky assets.

Consequently, the portfolio  $(T)$  is the optimal portfolio. All investors with the same efficient frontier and the same risk-free rate, choose the same portfolio  $T$ .

It is worth noting that the optimal portfolio  $\mathrm{T}$  can be defined without any information on investor characteristics (Elton et al. 2013).

If it is possible to invest in risk-free assets but it is not possible to borrow at a risk-free rate, the efficient frontier is equal to  $R_{F}CD'$ .

Otherwise, if it is possible to invest in a risk-free asset and borrow at a risk-free rate, the efficient frontier is equal to  $R_{F}CD$ .

Finally, it is important to point out that, with other conditions equal, the  $R_{F}$  reduction implies the downward movement of the tangent point on the curve. It implies a reduction in the expected return of the optimal portfolio. It leads investors to undertake more risks in an attempt to achieve a higher expected return.

# 5.3 Efficient Portfolios

The third step of the process concerns the definition of the efficient portfolios.

There are several techniques for the definition of the efficient portfolios. The most important one can be analysed on the basis of four main assumptions (Elton et al. 2013):

- case 1: short selling is permitted and it is possible to borrow and invest at a risk-free rate;
- case 2: short selling is permitted and it is not possible to borrow or invest at a risk-free rate;
- case 3: short selling is not permitted and it is possible to borrow and invest at a risk-free rate;
- case 4: short selling is not permitted and it is not possible to borrow or invest at a risk-free rate.

These four cases can be summarized as shown in Table 5.1.

(Case 1) Short Selling is permitted and it is possible to Borrow and Invest at a Risk-Free Rate

The risk-free rate  $(R_F)$  for borrowing and for investing implies the existence of one optimal portfolio of risky asset. It is positioned on the straight line originating from the  $R_F$  (interception point on the ordinate) and it is tangent to the opportunity

Table 5.1 Short selling and the opportunity to borrow and invest at a risk-free rate

<table><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Borrowing and investing at a risk-free rate</td></tr><tr><td>Yes</td><td>Not</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Short selling</td><td>Yes</td><td>Case 1</td><td>Case 2</td></tr><tr><td>Not</td><td>Case 3</td><td>Case 4</td></tr></table>

frontier (the curve). The line between  $R_{F}$  and the tangent point with the opportunity frontier defines the efficient frontier. Indeed, this line has a greater slope possible based on the  $R_{F}$  value (defining the point of interception on the ordinate) and the statistical characteristics of the risky assets that define the risky portfolio.

The straight line between the risk-free asset and the risky assets portfolio is equal to the ratio between the portfolio's expected return  $(\mu_P)$  less the risk-free rate  $(R_F)$  and the portfolio's standard deviation  $(\sigma_P)$  as follows (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\theta = \frac {\mu_ {P} - R _ {f}}{\sigma_ {P}} \tag {5.84}
$$

Note that in the tangent point the slope of the straight line and the curve is the same, as follows:

$$
\frac {\mu_ {\mathrm {P}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {f}}}{\sigma_ {\mathrm {P}}} = \frac {\mu_ {1} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {f}}}{\sigma_ {1}}
$$

The optimization constrained problem, can be formalized as follows:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \max  _ {\alpha_ {i}} \theta = \frac {\mu_ {P} - R _ {F}}{\sigma_ {P}} \\ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} = 1 \end{array} \right. \tag {5.85}
$$

where the first is the equation to be maximized and the second is the constraint.

To avoid the Lagrangian the constraint can be replaced in the equation to be maximized (Elton et al. 2013).

It is possible to multiply both terms of the constraint for risk-free rate  $(R_F)$  as follows:

$$
R _ {F} \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} = R _ {F} \rightarrow \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \left(\alpha_ {i} R _ {F}\right) = R _ {F}
$$

Remember that the portfolio's expected return and its standard deviation are the following:

# 5.3 Efficient Portfolios

$$
\mu_ {P} = \sum_ {\stackrel {i = 1} {\sigma_ {P}}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \mu_ {i} = \sqrt {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\stackrel {j = 1} {j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i , j}} = \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\stackrel {j = 1} {j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i , j}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2}}
$$

and by substituting the constraint in the equation to be maximized, we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \theta = \frac{\mu_{P} - R_{F}}{\sigma_{P}} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}\alpha_{i}\mu_{i} - \sum_{i = 1}^{N}(\alpha_{i}R_{F})}{\left(\sum_{i = 1}^{N}\alpha_{i}^{2}\sigma_{i}^{2} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq i}}^{N}\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{i,j}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}} \\ = \frac {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} (\mu_ {i} - R _ {F})}{\left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i , j}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2}}} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\theta = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}\alpha_{i}(\mu_{i} - R_{F})}{\left(\sum_{i = 1}^{N}\alpha_{i}^{2}\sigma_{i}^{2} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq i}}^{N}\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{i,j}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}}
$$

Therefore, the optimization constrained problem is moved into a simple maximization problem. It is necessary to calculate the first derivative with regards to each variable and placing equal to zero. The problem can be solved by solving this equation system (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \frac {\partial \theta}{\partial \alpha_ {1}} = 0 \\ \frac {\partial \theta}{\partial \alpha_ {2}} = 0 \\ \dots \\ \dots \\ \frac {\partial \theta}{\partial \alpha_ {n}} = 0 \end{array} \right. \tag {5.86}
$$

Generally, the first derivative of  $\theta$  respect to  $\alpha_{k}$ , is equal to:

$$
\frac {\partial \theta}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} = - \left[ \lambda \alpha_ {k} \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} + \sum_ {\substack {i = 1 \\ j \neq k}} ^ {n} \lambda \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k, j} \right] + (\mu_ {k} - R _ {F}) = 0 \tag{5.87}
$$

and in an extensive form, it is equal to:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\partial \theta}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} = - \left(\lambda \alpha_ {1} \sigma_ {1, i} + \lambda \alpha_ {2} \sigma_ {2, i} + \lambda \alpha_ {3} \sigma_ {3, i} \dots + \lambda \alpha_ {i} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \dots + \lambda \alpha_ {n - 1} \sigma_ {n - 1, i} + \lambda \alpha_ {n} \sigma_ {n, i}\right) \\ + \mu_ {k} - R _ {F} = 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

In the equation  $\lambda$  is a constant and it is equal to:

$$
\lambda = \frac {\mu_ {P} - R _ {f}}{\sigma_ {P} ^ {2}} = \frac {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \left(\mu_ {i} - R _ {f}\right)}{\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i , j}} \tag{5.88}
$$

Since each  $\alpha_{k}$  (for  $k = 1,2,\ldots n$ ) is multiplied by the constant  $\lambda$ , it is possible to rewrite the first derivative on the basis of a new variable:

$$
Z _ {k} = \lambda \alpha_ {k} \tag {5.89}
$$

The  $\lambda$  is constant. Therefore,  $Z_{k}$  is proportional to  $\alpha_{k}$  and therefore to the part of wealth invested in the k-th asset.

By replacing it we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\partial \theta}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} = - \left(Z _ {1} \sigma_ {1, i} + Z _ {2} \sigma_ {2, i} + Z _ {3} \sigma_ {3, i} \dots + Z _ {i} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \dots + Z _ {n - 1} \sigma_ {n - 1, i} + Z _ {n} \sigma_ {n, i}\right) + \mu_ {k} - R _ {f} = 0 \\ - \left(Z _ {1} \sigma_ {1, i} + Z _ {2} \sigma_ {2, i} + Z _ {3} \sigma_ {3, i} \dots + Z _ {i} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \dots + Z _ {n - 1} \sigma_ {n - 1, i} + Z _ {n} \sigma_ {n, i}\right) + \mu_ {k} - R _ {f} = 0 \\ Z _ {1} \sigma_ {1, i} + Z _ {2} \sigma_ {2, i} + Z _ {3} \sigma_ {3, i} \dots + Z _ {i} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \dots + Z _ {n - 1} \sigma_ {n - 1, i} + Z _ {n} \sigma_ {n, i} = \mu_ {k} - R _ {f} \\ \end{array}
$$

and therefore:

$$
Z _ {1} \sigma_ {1, i} + Z _ {2} \sigma_ {2, i} + Z _ {3} \sigma_ {3, i} \dots + Z _ {i} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \dots + Z _ {n - 1} \sigma_ {n - 1, i} + Z _ {n} \sigma_ {n} = \mu_ {k} - R _ {f}
$$

This is the equation for each value of  $i$ . The solution implies the following equation system (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \mu_ {1} - R _ {F} = Z _ {1} \sigma_ {1} ^ {2} + Z _ {2} \sigma_ {1, 2} + Z _ {3} \sigma_ {1, 3} + \dots + Z _ {n} \sigma_ {1, n} \\ \mu_ {2} - R _ {F} = Z _ {1} \sigma_ {1, 2} + Z _ {2} \sigma_ {2} ^ {2} + Z _ {3} \sigma_ {2, 3} + \dots + Z _ {n} \sigma_ {2, n} \\ \mu_ {3} - R _ {F} = Z _ {1} \sigma_ {1, 3} + Z _ {2} \sigma_ {2, 3} + Z _ {3} \sigma_ {3} ^ {2} + \dots + Z _ {n} \sigma_ {3, n} \\ \dots \\ \mu_ {n} - R _ {F} = Z _ {1} \sigma_ {1, n} + Z _ {2} \sigma_ {2, n} + Z _ {3} \sigma_ {3, n} + \dots + Z _ {n} \sigma_ {n} ^ {2} \end{array} \right. \tag {5.90}
$$

The terms  $Z_{k}$  (for  $k = 1,2,\ldots,n$ ) are proportional to the optimal amount to be invested in each asset. To define the optimal amount to be invested, the equations for  $Z_{s}$  must be defined. There are  $N$  equations (one for each asset) and  $N$  terms unknown (the  $Z_{k}$  for each asset). Subsequently, the optimal amount (as a percentage) to be invested in the  $k$ -th asset is equal to (Elton et al. 2013):

Fig. 5.15 The risk-free rate changes and optimal portfolio

$$
\alpha_ {k} = \frac {Z _ {k}}{\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} Z _ {i}} \tag {5.91}
$$

(Case 2) Short Selling is permitted and it is not possible to Borrow or Invest at a Risk-Free Rate

In this case, the problem is related to the risk-free rate. By changing the risk-free rate, the tangent point on the curve changes, as shown in Fig. 5.15.

If the risk-free rate is  $R_F'$ , the optimal portfolio is equal to  $D$ , while if the risk-free rate is  $R_F$  the optimal portfolio is  $C$ .

The problem can be solved by considering that the optimal amount to be invested in each asset is linear function of the risk-free rate  $R_{F}$ . For each value of  $R_{F}$  the optimal portfolio can be defined on the basis of the efficient frontier as defined with regards to the statistical characteristics of the assets.

Formally, based on Eq. (5.89) it is possible to solve  $Z_{k}$  as function of  $R_{F}$  as follows (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
Z _ {k} = C _ {o k} + C _ {1 k} R _ {F} \tag {5.92}
$$

where  $C_{ok}$  and  $C_{1k}$  are constant. They change with a change in  $k$  but they are constant compared with  $R_F$ . Consequently, by changing  $R_F$ , the amount to be invested in the  $k$ -th asset on the different point of the efficient frontier is changed.

(Case 3) Short Selling is not Permitted and it is Possible to Borrow and Invest at a Risk-Free Rate The difference between Case 3 and Case 1 is that the investors have to own a positive amount of the assets  $(\alpha_{i} > 0)$ .

Therefore, optimization constrained problem can be formalized as follows (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \max  _ {\alpha_ {i}} \theta = \frac {\mu_ {P} - R _ {f}}{\sigma_ {P}} \\ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i} = 1 \\ \alpha_ {i} \geq 0 \quad \forall i \end{array} \right. \tag {5.93}
$$

where the first is the equation to be maximized while the second and third equations are the constraints.

It is important to note that the equation to be maximized is not linear but quadratic. It is due to the terms  $\alpha_{i}^{2},\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}$  in the portfolio's variance  $(\sigma_P^2)$  and therefore in the standard deviation  $(\sigma_P)$ . Therefore, the problem is a quadratic programming, and it requires the use of a specific algorithm that is usually structured on the basis of the Kuhn-Tucker conditions. They can be summarized as follows (Elton et al. 2013).

We must have a derivative of  $\theta$  compared with each  $\alpha_{i}$  and set it to zero in order to find the maximum value of  $\theta$ . The problem regards the constraints. If there is no constraint,  $\alpha_{i}$  can be positive or negative and the optimum can occur when  $\alpha_{i}$  is positive or negative. Otherwise, if there is a constraint and  $\alpha_{i}$  must not be negative ( $\alpha_{i} \geq 0$ ) the optimum could be achieved at a value of  $\alpha_{i}$  which is not feasible, as shown in Fig. 5.16.

The variable  $\theta$  as function of  $\alpha_{i}$  may look like Curve 1 or Curve 2.

If there is a constraint and  $\alpha_{i}$  should not be negative  $(\alpha_{i} \geq 0)$ , in the case of Curve  $I$  the maximum feasible value of  $\theta$  occurs at point  $M$ . Otherwise, in the of Curve 2, the maximum feasible value of  $\theta$  occurs at point  $M_{1}$  rather than  $M_{2}$ .

Fig. 5.16 Value of the function  $\theta$  as  $\alpha_{i}$  changes

# 5.3 Efficient Portfolios

If the maximum value for  $\alpha_{i}$  occurs at  $M_{1}$  (Curve 2) then the partial derivative of  $\theta$  with regards to  $\alpha_{i}$  is negative  $(\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial\alpha_i} < 0)$  at the maximum feasible value (for  $\alpha_{i} = 0$ ).

Otherwise, if the maximum value for  $\alpha_{i}$  occurs at  $M$  (Curve 1) then the partial derivative of  $\theta$  with regards to  $\alpha_{i}$  is equal to zero  $(\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial\alpha_i} = 0)$  at the maximum feasible value (for  $\alpha_{i}\geq 0$ ).

Therefore, if there is a constraint based on which  $\alpha_{i}$  should not be negative  $(\alpha_{i} \geq 0)$ , we have:

$$
\frac {\partial \theta}{\partial x _ {i}} \leq 0
$$

This relationship can be re-written as follows:

$$
\frac {\partial \theta}{\partial x _ {i}} + U _ {i} = 0 \tag {5.94}
$$

where  $U_{i}$  is the part to reach zero.

This is the first Kuhn-Tucker condition for maximization.

Therefore, if the optimum occurs when:

-  $\alpha_{i}$  is positive (Curve 1): the derivative is equal to zero and then  $U_{i}$  it is equal to zero:

$$
\alpha_ {i} > 0 \rightarrow \frac {\partial \theta}{\partial \alpha_ {i}} = 0 \rightarrow U _ {i} = 0 \Leftrightarrow \alpha_ {i} > 0, \quad U _ {i} = 0
$$

- the maximum occurs at  $\alpha_{i}$  equal to zero (Curve 2): the derivative is negative and then  $U_{i}$  is positive:

$$
\alpha_ {i} = 0 \rightarrow \frac {\partial \theta}{\partial \alpha_ {i}} \leq 0 \rightarrow U _ {i} > 0 \Leftrightarrow \alpha_ {i} = 0, \quad U _ {i} > 0
$$

In general terms, these relationships can be written in a compact form, as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \alpha_ {i} U _ {i} = 0 \\ \alpha_ {i} \geq 0 \tag {5.95} \\ U _ {i} \geq 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

This is the second Kuhn-Tucker condition for maximization.

Therefore, the four Kuhn-Tucker conditions can be summarized as follows (Elton et al. 2013):

(1)  $\frac{\partial\theta_i}{\partial\alpha_i} +U_i = 0$
(2)  $\alpha_{i} = U_{i} = 0$  (5.96)
(3)  $\alpha_{i}\geq 0$
(4)  $U_{i}\geq 0$

Therefore, if the solution respects these conditions, then it allows for definition of the optimal portfolio. In other words, if the solution suggested satisfies the Kuhn-Tucker conditions, then it gives the optimum portfolio.

(Case 4) Short Selling is not Permitted and it is not Possible to Borrow or Invest at a Risk-Free Rate In this case the efficient frontier is obtained by minimizing the portfolio's risk for a defined level of expected returns. Formally (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \min  _ {\alpha_ {i}} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i, j} \\ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} = 1 \\ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \mu_ {i} = \mu_ {P} \\ \alpha_ {i} \geq 0 \quad i = 1, 2, \dots , N \end{array} \right. \tag{5.97}
$$

The first is the equation to be minimized, while the second, third and fourth are the constraints. The first constraint  $\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_{i} = 1\right)$  shows that short selling is not permitted; while the last  $(\alpha_{i} \geq 0)$  shows that the amount to be invested in each asset is positive or null (it is not possible to borrow at a risk-free rate).

The equation to be minimized is quadratic due to the terms  $\alpha_{i}^{2},\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}$  in the portfolio's variance. Therefore, it is necessary to use the four conditions of Kuhn-Tucker to solve the problem by defining the optimal portfolio.

# 5.4 Optimal Portfolio

The fourth step of the process is the choice of the optimal portfolio. It is function of the investor's preferences. A specific level of risk characterizes the investor. In this regard the investor solves the trade-off between risk and return.

The mean-variance criterion does not define which portfolio on the efficient frontier must be chosen. The choice is function of the investor's risk aversion level, and this variable is not considered in the model.

The investor's choices can be achieved by using the utility function. Therefore, the optimal portfolio for the investor is the efficient portfolio on the efficient frontier maximising the investor's utility function (Castellani et al. 2005; Cohen and Pogue

1967; Connor and Korajczyk 1993; Carhart 1997; Chan et al. 1999; Elton et al. 2006, 2013; Levy 1984).

It is important to note that the expected utility must be defined on the basis of mean and variance. The coherence between the expected utility criterion and the mean-variance criterion, the utility function must be quadratic and/or the returns follow a normal distribution.

Assuming that the investor invests in a time  $t$  in the portfolio  $P$  consisting of assets  $a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ . Assuming that the investor is characterized by the utility function  $\mu(x)$ . Assuming that the value of the portfolio in a future period  $s$  is equal to  $A_P$ . The investor's choice is based on the maximization of the expected utility in a time  $s$ , as follows:

$$
U = E [ \mu (x) ] = E [ \mu \left(A _ {P}\right) ] \tag {5.98}
$$

If the utility function is quadratic or the expected returns follow a normal distribution (so that there is coherence between the utility function criterion and the mean-variance criterion), the expected utility can be expressed as function of the portfolio's standard deviation  $(\sigma_P)$  and its expected return  $(\mu_P)$ , as follows:

$$
U \left(\sigma_ {P}, \mu_ {P}\right) \tag {5.99}
$$

Therefore, the expected utility is increasing function of the portfolio's expected return  $(\mu_P)$  and it is decreasing function of its standard deviation  $(\sigma_P)$ .

In the plane  $(\sigma_P, \mu_P)$  it is possible to introduce lines corresponding to the same fixed level of the expected utility  $\bar{\mu}$ , as follows (Castellani et al. 2005):

$$
U \left(\sigma_ {P}, \mu_ {P}\right) = \bar {\mu} \quad \sigma \geq 0 \tag {5.100}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-10/87fea16b-33f6-43ec-8056-5ef3565ac4c2/fd47ddbc6f5ed2a65c07239f572742d425ab775eb15ae14d48997c66451ad0b6.jpg)
Fig. 5.17 Indifference curves and portfolio choices

All portfolios that satisfy this equation are indifferent for the investor with regards to his expected return. Consequently, the level lines of  $U$  (the indifference curves) identify the indifferent lines for the investor for each defined level  $\bar{\mu}$ .

The indifference curves in the plan  $(\sigma_{P},\mu_{P})$  are convex (upward concavity). The higher the investor risk aversion, the higher the convexity; in the same way, the lower the investor risk aversion, the lower the convexity.

Moving towards the upper left in the plan, the curves correspond to the  $\bar{\mu}$  levels of expected utility growth. Under this assumption, there is one efficient portfolio that maximizes  $U$ : this portfolio is represented by the point P in which the efficient frontier is tangent to the indifference curve corresponding to the  $\bar{\mu}$  maximum value.

Investors with a different level of risk aversion, and therefore with a different convexity of the indifference curve, but defining the same efficient frontier, choose a different efficient portfolio on the efficient frontier as shown by the points  $P'$  and  $P''$  in Fig. 5.17 (adapted from Castellani et al. 2005).

Using  $\mu (\sigma ;\bar{\mu})$  to denote the function that explicitly expresses the indifference curve according to the investor's expected utility  $\bar{\mu}$ , the abscissa of the point  $\sigma$  of the maximum utility is uniquely determined as the system solution in two equations in variables  $\sigma$  and  $\bar{\mu}$ , as follows (Castellani et al. 2005):

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \mu (\sigma ; \bar {\mu}) = i + \pi_ {M} \sigma \\ \frac {\partial \mu (\sigma ; \bar {\mu})}{\partial \sigma} = \pi_ {M} \end{array} \right. \tag {5.101}
$$

The first equation defines the tangent condition between the indifference curve and the efficient line. The second equation indicates that the indifference curve has to have the same slope as the indifference line, in the tangent point.

The problem can be formalized in a matrix form as follows (Cesari 2012b):

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \max  _ {w _ {1}, \dots , w _ {N}} \Psi \binom {+} {\mu_ {p}}; \sigma_ {p} ^ {2} \\ \mu_ {p} = \alpha^ {\prime} \mu \\ \sigma_ {p} ^ {2} = \alpha^ {\prime} \Sigma \alpha \\ \alpha^ {\prime} \mathbf {1} = 1 \end{array} \right. \tag {5.102}
$$

The first equation is the function of indirect utility.

For calculation of the indifference curves, the differential of the utility function must be defined (Cesari 2012b):

$$
\mathrm {d} \Psi = \frac {\partial \Psi}{\partial \mu_ {p}} d \mu_ {p} + \frac {\partial \Psi}{\partial \sigma_ {p}} d \sigma_ {p} = 0 \tag {5.103}
$$

It is equal to zero, and therefore the utility level does not change, so:

# 5.4 Optimal Portfolio

Fig. 5.18 The efficient frontier and the indifference curve

$$
\frac {d \mu_ {p}}{d \sigma_ {p}} = \frac {- \frac {\partial \Psi}{\partial \sigma_ {p}}}{\frac {\partial \Psi}{\partial \mu_ {p}}} > 0 \tag {5.104}
$$

Positivity of the marginal rate of substitution, identifies the trade-off between the portfolio's expected return and its standard deviation for a defined investor with preference  $\Psi$ . Consequently, if the portfolio risk increases, it can only be accepted with an increase in the expected return  $(\mu_p)$ .

Graphically, the indifference curves allow for definition of the optimal portfolio. They are perfectly increasing in the plan  $(\sigma_p; \mu_p)$  and they represent constant levels of wealth on the same curve and increasing in step upwards (from the north-west) by a curve.

The growth in the indifference curve shows that the higher-level risk must be compensated by higher expected return. The slope of the indifference curves represents the subjective risk premium of the investor and therefore his aversion to risk.

The match between the information arising from capital markets as summarized in the efficient frontier on the one hand, and the information arising from the investor's preferences as summarized by the indifference curve on the other hand, allows for solving of the problem of portfolio choices. The optimal portfolio is positioned on the efficient frontier and it is tangent to the higher indifference curve, as shown in Fig. 5.18 (adapted from Cesari 2012b).

Figure 5.18 shows with regards to investor  $A$ , that the optimal portfolio is obtained by the tangent between curve  $A - I''$  and the efficient frontier and also, as far as investor  $B$  is concerned, it is obtained by the tangent between curve  $B - I''$  and the efficient frontier.

# 5.5 Single Index Model

One of the most important problems of the portfolio choices refers to the correct application of the theoretical approach due to the high number and quality of the input data required: the correct application of the theoretical model requires an estimate of the expected returns of each asset that may potentially be introduced into the portfolio as well as an assessment of all of the covariance between the assets' expected returns in a couple. Specifically, by considering N assets in portfolio, the correlation between the assets in a couple are equal to  $[N(N - 1)] / 2$  as discussed previously.

Several models are developed to reduce the complexity by reducing the amount of data input to calculate the correlation between the assets' expected returns in the portfolio.

To do this, they allow for application of the theory by introducing some constraints and assumptions. These constraints and assumptions reduce the level of accuracy of the model but they allow for simplification. Among these models, the most useful model is the Single Index Model (Elton et al. 2013).

The Single Index Model is the most simple model of the portfolio's theory. It can be considered as a special case of the Market Model as illustrated at a later stage.

The model assumes one common factor, the single index, on which the movement of all assets depend.

The model is based on empirical evidence: usually, when the market increases, as indicated by the positivity of some indexes, the majority of the assets increase; on the contrary, when the market decreases, as indicated by the negativity of some indexes, the majority of the assets decrease. It leads us to believe that these assets are connected between them, because they respond to the same common factor. Consequently, a measure of the correlation between the assets can be obtained indirectly by considering the relationship between each asset's expected returns with the defined index's expected returns.

Formally, the i-th asset's expected return  $(R_{i})$  can be defined as follows (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
R _ {i} = F _ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {m} \tag {5.105}
$$

where:

-  $F_{i}$ : is the part of the asset's expected return not related to the index. It is function of the company's specific characteristics. It is a random variable;
-  $R_{m}$ : is the defined index's expected return. It is a random variable;
-  $\beta_{i}$ : is a constant and it measures the sensibility of the asset's expected returns  $(R_{i})$  to the change in the index's expected returns  $(R_{m})$ . It measures the expected change in the  $R_{i}$  due to the change in  $R_{m}$ .

Therefore, Eq. (5.105) divides the asset's expected return in two parts:

# 5.5 Single Index Model

- the first  $(F_{i})$ , is independent of the market, as it is represented by the index defined, and it is based on the company's specific characteristics;
- the second  $(\beta_{i}R_{m})$ , is dependent of the market, as it is represented by the index defined, on the basis of a sensibility coefficient.

The component  $F_{i}$  can be divided in two parts, as follows:

$$
F _ {i} = f _ {i} + e _ {i} \tag {5.106}
$$

where:

- the first part  $(f_i)$  denotes the expected value of  $F_{i}$  and can be defined as "anticipated term";
- the second part  $(e_i)$  denotes the random (uncertain) element and therefore the residual term of  $F_{i}$  and it can only be known at the end of the period.

The asset's risk is function of the second part of Eq. (5.107), and therefore from the probability structure of  $e_i$ .

Expectations on the value of the assets in the starting time  $(t_0)$  is function of the information reflected in the price through the component  $f_{i}$ . Therefore,  $f_{i}$  is a component of the asset's price in  $t_0$ .

The component  $e_i$  is a random variable. The opinion on it usually reflects the investors risk behaviour. Its introduction in the price is mainly due to the investors risk aversion. Therefore, they require a risk premium to invest in risky assets. This premium risk is the largest return required by investors and it can be translated in a price discount.

On the basis of Eq. (5.106), Eq. (5.105) we have (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
R _ {i} = f _ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {m} + e _ {i} \tag {5.107}
$$

where both  $e_i$  that  $R_{m}$  are random variables.

The Single Index Model is based on a set of parameters (Elton et al. 2013).

The standard equation is defined by Eq. (5.107) as follows:

$$
R _ {i} = f _ {i} + e _ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {m} \quad f o r i = 1, 2, 3, \dots , N
$$

By construction, the mean of  $e_i$  is equal to:

$$
E \left(e _ {i}\right) = 0 \quad f o r i = 1, 2, 3, \dots , N \tag {5.108}
$$

By definition, the variances of  $e_i$  and  $R_m$  are equal to:

$$
E \left[ e _ {i} - E \left(e _ {i}\right) \right] ^ {2} = E \left(e _ {i} - 0\right) ^ {2} = E \left(e _ {i}\right) ^ {2} = \sigma_ {e _ {i}} ^ {2} \quad f o r i = 1, 2, 3, \dots , N \tag {5.109}
$$

$$
E \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) ^ {2} = \sigma_ {R _ {m}} ^ {2} \tag {5.110}
$$

There are two main baseline assumptions:

Assumption 1 there is no correlation between  $e_i$  and  $R_m$  (for  $i = 1,2,3,\ldots,N$ ). Therefore, we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} C o v \left(e _ {i}; R _ {m}\right) = E \left[ \left(e _ {i} - E \left(e _ {i}\right)\right) \left(R _ {m} - E \left(R _ {m}\right)\right) \right] = E \left[ e _ {i} \left(R _ {m} - E \left(R _ {m}\right)\right) \right] \\ = E \left[ e _ {i} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) \right] = 0 \tag {5.111} \\ \end{array}
$$

Therefore, the assumption ensures that the two variables  $(e_i$  and  $R_{m})$  are independent among them. Specifically, the accuracy of the equation to describe the asset's return is independent from the index's return.

Assumption 2 each asset is only correlated to the market index representing the common factor. It implies non-correlation between the random elements (residual) of the assets  $(e_i$  and  $e_j$  for each  $i$ -th and  $j$ -th asset). Therefore, the covariance between the residuals of i-th asset and j-th asset (for  $i = 1,2,3,\dots,N$  and  $j = 1,2,3,\dots,N$ ) are equal to zero, as follows:

$$
E \left[ \left(e _ {i} - \mu_ {e _ {i}}\right) \left(e _ {j} - \mu_ {e _ {j}}\right) \right] = E \left(e _ {i} e _ {j}\right) = 0 \tag {5.112}
$$

Therefore, the assumption ensures that the returns of the assets are connected with the market index's returns only, and not among them. Consequently, the returns of all assets move in the same direction because they move with the same common factor as represented by the market index, not because they are related among them. The assumption implies that the only reason assets vary together is because of common movement with the market index.

These two assumptions are very restrictive. They represent strong simplification and they represent a relevant approximation to reality. By combining these two assumptions, the Single Index Model is based on the simple concept that stock prices move together only because of common movement with the market as represented by market index. It assumes that the stock prices move together only because of a common co-movement with market index.

On the basis of these assumptions, it is possible to estimate the expected returns and the variance and the portfolio and the covariance between the assets in portfolio.

The i-th asset's expected return  $(R_{i})$  is equal to (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\begin{array}{l} R _ {i} = f _ {i} + e _ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {m} \rightarrow E (R _ {i}) = E \left(f _ {i} + e _ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {m}\right)\rightarrow E (R _ {i}) \\ = E \left(f _ {i}\right) + E \left(e _ {i}\right) + E \left(\beta_ {i} R _ {m}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

Considering that  $f_{i}$  and  $\beta_{i}$  are constant, and  $E(e_{i}) = 0$ , we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} E \left(R _ {i}\right) = f _ {i} + \beta_ {i} E \left(R _ {m}\right) \\ E \left(R _ {i}\right) = f _ {i} + \beta_ {i} E \left(R _ {m}\right) \leftrightarrow \mu_ {\mathrm {i}} = \mathrm {f} _ {\mathrm {i}} + \beta_ {\mathrm {i}} \mu_ {\mathrm {m}} \tag {5.113} \\ \end{array}
$$

# 5.5 Single Index Model

The i-th asset's variance  $\left(\sigma_i^2\right)$  is equal to (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\sigma_ {i} ^ {2} = E \left(R _ {i} - E \left(R _ {i}\right)\right) ^ {2} \rightarrow \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} = E \left(R _ {i} - \mu_ {i}\right) ^ {2}
$$

By substituting  $R_{i}$  and  $\mu_{i}$  with relative Eqs. (5.107) and (5.113), we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} = E \left[ \left(f _ {i} + e _ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {m}\right) - \left(f _ {i} + \beta_ {i} \mu_ {m}\right) \right] ^ {2} = E \left[ f _ {i} + e _ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {m} - f _ {i} - \beta_ {i} \mu_ {m} \right] ^ {2} \\ = E \left[ e _ {i} + \beta_ {i} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) \right] ^ {2} = E \left[ \left(e _ {i}\right) ^ {2} + \left(\beta_ {i} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right)\right) ^ {2} + 2 e _ {i} \beta_ {i} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) \right] \\ = E \left(e _ {i}\right) ^ {2} + E \left[ \beta_ {i} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) \right] ^ {2} + E \left[ 2 e _ {i} \beta_ {i} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

Considering that  $\beta_{i}$  it is constant, and by considering that  $E(e_i)^2 = \sigma_{ei}^2$ ,  $E(R_m - \mu_m)^2 = \sigma_m^2$  and  $E[e_i(R_m - \mu_m)] = 0$ , we have:

$$
\sigma_ {i} ^ {2} = E \left(e _ {i}\right) ^ {2} + \beta_ {i} ^ {2} E \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) ^ {2} + 2 \beta_ {i} E \left(e _ {i} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right)\right)
$$

and then:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2} = \beta_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {m}} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {e i} ^ {2} \tag {5.114}
$$

The covariance between the  $i$ -th asset and the  $j$ -th assets, is equal to (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\sigma_ {i, j} = E \left[\left(R _ {i} - E \left(R _ {i}\right)\right)\left(R _ {j} - E \left(R _ {j}\right)\right)\right]\rightarrow \sigma_ {i, j} = E \left[\left(R _ {i} - \mu_ {i}\right)\left(R _ {j} - \mu_ {j}\right)\right]
$$

Substituting  $R_{i}, R_{j}, \mu_{i}$  and  $\mu_{j}$  with relative equations, we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {i, j} = E \left\{\left[ \left(f _ {i} + e _ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {m}\right) - \left(f _ {i} + \beta_ {i} \mu_ {m}\right) \right] \left[ \left(f _ {j} + e _ {j} + \beta_ {j} R _ {m}\right) - \left(f _ {j} + \beta_ {j} \mu_ {m}\right) \right] \right\} \\ = E \left\{\left[ f _ {i} + e _ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {m} - f _ {i} - \beta_ {i} \mu_ {m} \right] \left[ f _ {j} + e _ {j} + \beta_ {j} R _ {m} - f _ {j} - \beta_ {j} \mu_ {m} \right] \right\} \\ = E \left\{\left[ e _ {i} + \beta_ {i} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) \right] \left[ e _ {j} + \beta_ {j} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) \right] \right\} \\ = E \left[ e _ {i} e _ {j} + e _ {i} \beta_ {j} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) + e _ {j} \beta_ {i} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) + \beta_ {i} \beta_ {j} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) ^ {2} \right] \\ = E \left(e _ {i} e _ {j}\right) + E \left[ e _ {i} \beta_ {j} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) \right] + E \left[ e _ {j} \beta_ {i} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) \right] + E \left[ \beta_ {i} \beta_ {j} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) ^ {2} \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

and considering that  $\beta_{j}$  it is a constant, and by considering that  $\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{e}_{\mathrm{i}}) = 0$ $\mathrm{E}(\mathrm{R_m} - \mu_{\mathrm{m}})^2 = \sigma_{\mathrm{m}}^2$ $\mathrm{E}[\mathbf{e}_{\mathrm{i}}(\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{m}} - \mu_{\mathrm{m}})] = 0$  and  $E(e_i e_j) = 0$ , we have:

$$
\sigma_ {i, j} = E \left(e _ {i} e _ {j}\right) + \beta_ {j} E \left[ e _ {i} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) \right] + \beta_ {i} E \left[ e _ {j} \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) \right] + \beta_ {i} \beta_ {j} E \left[ \left(R _ {m} - \mu_ {m}\right) ^ {2} \right]
$$

and then:

$$
\sigma_ {\mathrm {i}, \mathrm {j}} = \beta_ {\mathrm {i}} \beta_ {\mathrm {j}} \sigma_ {\mathrm {m}} ^ {2} \tag {5.115}
$$

Based on Eqs. (5.113), (5.114) and (5.115) it is possible to estimate the expected return and the variance (and therefore standard deviation) of the portfolio.

The portfolio's expected return  $(\mu_P)$  is equal to (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\mu_ {P} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \mu_ {i}
$$

and by considering that:

$$
\mu_ {i} = f _ {i} + \beta_ {i} \mu_ {m} \rightarrow \mu_ {P} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \left(f _ {i} + \beta_ {i} \mu_ {m}\right)
$$

and therefore:

$$
\mu_ {\mathrm {P}} = \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} f _ {\mathrm {i}} + \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} \beta_ {\mathrm {i}} \mu_ {\mathrm {m}} \tag {5.116}
$$

The portfolio's variance  $(\sigma_P^2)$  is equal to (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\sigma_{P}^{2} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\alpha_{i}^{2}\sigma_{i}^{2} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq i}}^{N}\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{i,j}
$$

by considering that:

$$
\sigma_{i}^{2} = \sigma_{e_{i}}^{2} + \beta_{i}^{2}\sigma_{m}^{2}\\ \sigma_{i,j = \beta_{i}\beta_{j}\sigma_{m}^{2}}\to \sigma_{P}^{2} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\alpha_{i}^{2}\Big(\sigma_{e_{i}}^{2} + \beta_{i}^{2}\sigma_{m}^{2}\Big) + \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq i}}^{N}\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}\beta_{i}\beta_{j}\sigma_{m}^{2}
$$

and then:

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \beta_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \beta_ {i} \beta_ {j} \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {e _ {i}} ^ {2} \tag{5.117}
$$

Therefore, in order to estimate the portfolio's expected return  $(\mu_{\mathrm{P}})$  and its variance  $(\sigma_P^2)$ , it is necessary to estimate:

- three variables for each i-th asset:  $f_{i}$ ,  $\beta_{i}$  and  $\sigma_{i}^{2}$ ;
- two variables for the market index:  $\mu_{m}$  and  $\sigma_{m}^{2}$ .

# 5.5 Single Index Model

Consequently,  $3N + 2$  terms rather than  $[N(N - 1)] / 2$  are required. A reduction in the estimates is significant.

The Single Index Model tries to reduce complexity due to the pure portfolio theory. To do this, the Single Index Model assumes that the stock prices move together only because of common movement with the market as represented by the market index. Therefore, it assumes that the stock prices move together only because of a common co-movement with market index. This restrictive assumption reduces the number of correlations to be estimated and therefore it allows for easy application of the portfolio theory.

It is interesting to re-write the portfolio's expected return and variance on the basis of the portfolio's beta  $(\beta_{P})$  and its anticipated term  $(f_{P})$ . In both cases, they can be defined as a weighted average: the portfolio's beta  $(\beta_{P})$  is equal to the weighted average betas  $(\beta_{i})$  of the assets in portfolio, and the portfolio's anticipated term  $(f_{P})$  is equal to the weighted average anticipated term  $(f_{i})$  of the assets in portfolio (Elton et al. 2006). Formally:

$$
\beta_ {P} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \beta_ {i}; \quad f _ {P} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} f _ {i} \tag {5.118}
$$

The portfolio's expected return  $(\mu_P)$  can be re-written as follows:

$$
\mu_ {P} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} f _ {i} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \beta_ {i} \mu_ {m} \rightarrow \mu_ {P} = f _ {P} + \beta_ {P} \mu_ {m} \tag {5.119}
$$

It is worth noting that if the portfolio  $(P)$  is equal to the market portfolio, their expected returns must be equal. It implies that  $f_{P} = 0$  and  $\beta_{P} = 1$ :

$$
\mu_ {P} = \mu_ {m} \rightarrow\begin{array}{l}f _ {P} = 0\\\beta_ {P} = 1\end{array}\tag {5.120}
$$

It implies that the beta coefficient of the market must be equal to 1 and the i-th asset can be defined more or less risky than the market if the  $\beta_{i}$  is higher or lower than  $\beta_{P}$  respectively.

By considering that:

$$
\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \beta_ {i} = \beta_ {P}; \quad \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {j} \beta_ {j} = \beta_ {P}
$$

the portfolio's variance  $(\sigma_P^2)$  can be re-written as follows (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_{P}^{2} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\alpha_{i}^{2}\beta_{i}^{2}\sigma_{m}^{2} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq i}}^{N}\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}\beta_{i}\beta_{j}\sigma_{m}^{2} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\alpha_{i}^{2}\sigma_{e_{i}}^{2}\to \sigma_{P}^{2} \\ = \beta_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {m}} ^ {2} + \beta_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {m}} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {e _ {i}} ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

and by considering that the first and the second terms are the same, we have:

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \beta_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {m}} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {e _ {i}} ^ {2} \tag {5.121}
$$

Note that the same result can be obtained if the condition  $j \neq i$  is not considered in the portfolio's variance. In this case we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \beta_ {i} \beta_ {j} \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {e _ {i}} ^ {2} = \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \beta_ {i}\right) \left(\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {j} \beta_ {j}\right) \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {e _ {i}} ^ {2} \\ = \beta_ {\mathrm {P}} ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {m}} ^ {2} + \sum_ {\mathrm {i} = 1} ^ {\mathrm {N}} \alpha_ {\mathrm {i}} ^ {2} \sigma_ {\mathrm {e} _ {\mathrm {i}}} ^ {2} \\ \end{array}
$$

On the basis of the portfolio's variance, it is possible to analyse the effect of an increase in the portfolio assets. Assuming a portfolio of  $\mathbf{N}$  assets and assuming an investment of the same part of wealth in each asset so that:  $\alpha_{i} = \frac{1}{N}$ . On the basis of Eq. (5.121), the portfolio's variance is equal to (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \beta_ {P} ^ {2} \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \left(\frac {1}{N}\right) ^ {2} \sigma_ {e _ {i}} ^ {2} \rightarrow \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \beta_ {P} ^ {2} \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} + \frac {1}{N} \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \frac {1}{N} \sigma_ {e _ {i}} ^ {2}\right)\rightarrow \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} \\ = \beta_ {P} ^ {2} \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} + \frac {1}{N} \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \frac {\sigma_ {e _ {i}} ^ {2}}{N}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

It is important to note that the increase of the assets in portfolio  $(N)$  decreases the average residual risk  $\left(\sigma_{e_i}^2\right)$ . In fact:

$$
\lim  _ {N \rightarrow \infty} \frac {\sigma_ {e _ {i}} ^ {2}}{N} = 0 \rightarrow \lim  _ {N \rightarrow \infty} \frac {1}{N} \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \frac {\sigma_ {e _ {i}} ^ {2}}{N}\right) = 0
$$

Therefore, by increasing the number of assets in the portfolio  $(N)$ , the second part of the portfolio's risk is null and the only risk is associated with the portfolio's beta as follows:

# 5.5 Single Index Model

$$
\sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \beta_ {P} ^ {2} \sigma_ {m} ^ {2} \rightarrow \sigma_ {P} = \beta_ {P} \sigma_ {m} \tag {5.122}
$$

By considering that the portfolio's beta  $(\beta_{P})$  is equal to the weighted average betas  $(\beta_{i})$  of the assets in portfolio, we have (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\beta_ {P} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \beta_ {i} \rightarrow \sigma_ {P} = \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \beta_ {i}\right) \sigma_ {m}
$$

By considering that  $\sigma_{m}$  is the same for each i-th asset, the i-th asse's marginal contribution to the portfolio's risk is function of its coefficient beta  $(\beta_{i})$

Note that the i-th asset's variance, as defined by Eq. (5.114) can be split in two parts:

- the first part  $\left(\sigma_{e_i}^2\right)$  measures the specific risk of asset: it is not relevant with regards to the marginal contribution to the portfolio's risk. Indeed, it tends to be zero to increase assets in the portfolio;
- the second part  $\left(\beta_i^2\sigma_m^2\right)$  measures the systematic risk: it is independent of the number of assets in the portfolio and therefore it does not change by changing  $N$ . Also, by considering that  $\sigma_m^2$  is a constant for each of the N assets in portfolio, the contribution margin of the asset to the portfolio's risk is measured by  $\beta_i$  only. Therefore, this is the only element of risk to be considered and the coefficient beta  $(\beta_i)$  represents the risk measurement of the i-th asset in the portfolio.

It is worth noting that, by using the Single Index Model, the coefficient beta measures the systematic risk of the asset based on only the market index defined. In fact:

- the market portfolio is approximated by a specific market index and it is the same for each asset;
- the expected returns of each asset are not related among them but they are connected with the expected return of the market index only.

Therefore, the main problem is an estimate of the beta of the i-th assets that could be introduced in the portfolio. There are two main approaches:

- first approach: it is based on an estimate of the future betas on the correlations between the asset's expected returns and the index's expected returns. In this case, the beta estimate tends to be subjective as function of the subjective provision of the analyst about the expected returns;
- second approach: it is based on an estimate of the future betas on the basis of historical betas. This second approach is more useful and there is proof that historical betas provide useful information on future betas (Blume 1970; Levy 1971). This approach is normally preferred by analysts rather than the first one.

By following the second approach, the i-th asset's beta is estimated on the basis of the historical betas.

Equation (5.107) defines the i-th asset's expected return  $(R_{i})$ . Based on past data, it is possible to observe the past returns of the market and the i-th asset. If  $f_{i}$ ,  $\beta_{i}$  and  $\sigma_{e_i}^2$  are assumed to be constant through time, it is possible to expect the same equation at each point in time. Therefore, the straightforward procedure exists for an estimate of the parameters  $f_{i}$ ,  $\beta_{i}$  and  $\sigma_{e_i}^2$  (Elton et al. 2013). To do this, it is possible to use the regression analysis.

Therefore, by considering the time  $(t)$ , Eq. (5.107) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
R _ {i t} = f _ {i} + \beta_ {i} R _ {m t} + e _ {i} \tag {5.123}
$$

and applying the Ordinary Least Square (OLS), we have:

$$
\beta_ {i} = \frac {\sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \left[ \left(R _ {i t} - \mu_ {i t}\right) \left(R _ {m t} - \mu_ {m t}\right) \right]}{\sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \left(R _ {i t} - \mu_ {i t}\right) ^ {2}} = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {m} ; R _ {i}\right)}{\operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {m}\right)} = \frac {\sigma_ {\left(R _ {m} ; R _ {i}\right)}}{\sigma_ {R _ {m}} ^ {2}} \tag {5.124}
$$

and

$$
f _ {i} = R _ {i t} - \beta_ {i} R _ {m t} \tag {5.125}
$$

Obviously, the estimate is subject to error and therefore, the estimated  $\beta_{i}$  and  $f_{i}$  could not be equal to their real values that existed in the period. Furthermore,  $\beta_{i}$  and  $f_{i}$  are not perfectly stationarity over time.

The Single Index Model, can be considered as a special case of the Market Model. The difference is due to an assumption: while in the Single Index Model the covariance of the assets to the same market index only is assumed  $\left(E\left(e_i,e_j\right) = 0\right)$ , in the Market Model a correlation between expected returns of the assets in portfolio  $E\left(e_i,e_j\right)\neq 0$  is assumed. Therefore, the Market Model is characterized by a less restrictive form than the Single Index Model. In this sense, the Single Index Model can be considered a special case of the Market Model (Elton et al. 2013).

The standard Market Model can be defined as in Eq. (5.107). The change in assumption about the relationship among the expected returns of assets in portfolio, does not lead to the simple expressions of portfolio risk as in the Single Index Model. In other words, the Market Model reduces the complexity of the pure portfolio's theory less than the Single Index Model.

Therefore, while in the Single Index Model  $R_{m}$  is the expected returns of the market index choices as representative of the market portfolio, in the Market Model by removing the assumption  $E(e_{i}e_{j}) = 0$ ,  $R_{m}$  represents the expected returns of the portfolio built by the investor. Specifically, the expected returns of assets in portfolio are related among them, and therefore the investor has to define the portfolio by choosing the assets to be held on the basis of their expected returns and the correlations with the other assets owned. Consequently, the beta of the i-th asset changes as function of the choice of the assets in portfolio.

In general and therefore by moving from the Single Index Model to the Market Model by removing the assumption  $E\big(e_i e_j\big) = 0$ , for a well-diversified portfolio, non-systematic risk approach to zero and the only relevant asset's risk is the systematic risk measured by coefficient beta.

It is function of the correlation between the i-th asset's expected returns and the expected returns of all of the assets in portfolio. Subsequently beta is a measure of the risk emerging arise from the relationship between the asset's expected returns and the portfolio's expected returns.

By assuming a portfolio of  $\mathbf{N}$  assets and the i-th asset, the coefficient beta of the i-th asset can be changed if:

- the i-th asset's expected returns change, with the assets in the portfolio equal as well as their expected returns. In this case, the change in the i-th asset's beta is a function of the change in the company's elements that have an effect on free cash-flows to equity and then on its expected returns. The changes in the i-th asset's expected return generate a change in the correlation between them and the portfolio's expected returns;
- the assets in portfolio change, being equal the  $i$ -th asset's expected returns. In this case, the redefinition of the portfolio by changing the assets owned, generates new correlations between the  $i$ -th asset expected returns and the portfolio's expected returns;
- the assets in portfolio do not change but their expected returns change, with the  $i$ -th asset's expected returns equal. In this case, the change in the assets' expected returns change the portfolio's expected returns and therefore the correlations between them and the  $i$ -th asset's expected returns;
- the i-th asset's expected returns change together with a change in the portfolio assets or their expected returns. In this case, the i-th asset's beta changes as function of the new correlations between the i-th asset's expected returns and the portfolio's expected returns.

Therefore, the i-th asset's beta, and therefore its systematic risk, is function of the company's elements according to their effects on the expected returns and the portfolio's characteristics. Consequently, it changes over time.

Finally, it is interesting to note that the covariance refers to the asset's expected returns. The asset's expected return is function of the change in market prices. The changes are not only due to the fundamental analysis of the asset but they include market movements. Consequently, the asset's fundamental analysis is a part of the price movements on the market.
