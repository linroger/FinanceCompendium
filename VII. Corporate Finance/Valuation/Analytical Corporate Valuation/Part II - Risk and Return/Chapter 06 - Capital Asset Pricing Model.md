Abstract The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is the most well-known equilibrium model in the capital market. The standard form of CAPM provides a clear description of capital market behaviour if its basic assumptions are respected. There are two main problems. The first one is that some of the basic assumptions are very far from conditions of reality. This is not a problem in itself. The fact that these differences from reality are irrelevant enough, they do not have a material affect on the model's explanatory power. Secondly, the CAPM describes the conditions of equilibrium about returns on the macro level. It does not describe this equilibrium of micro level with regards to individual investor behaviour. Indeed, most investors and institutions have a risky assets portfolio different from the market portfolio. Therefore, while the model can explain the capital markets behaviour as an entity, it is unable to explain the investors' behaviour. In fact, the investor's portfolio is usually different from the market portfolio. For this reason, different versions from the CAPM standard are developed, by changing the basic assumptions. The aim is to understand and to explain the standard version of the CPM in greater detail, with the investor's behaviour on the one hand, and the assets price on the other hand. In this context, on the basis of the purpose of this book, the CAPM in its standard version only is considered.

# 6.1 Baseline Assumptions

The standard form of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) probably the most common and the easiest of the equilibrium models. It was developed independently by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965a), Mossin (1966). Indeed, it is usually referred to as the Sharpe-Linter-Mossin form of the Capital Asset Pricing Model.

The standard form of CAPM (Back 2017; Bawa and Lindenburg, 1977; Benninga and Protopapadakis 1991; Bernstein 1973; Cochrane 2001; Duffi 2001; Elton et al. 2013; Fama 1968, 1971, 1976, 1998; Kroll and Levy 1992; Lehari and Levy 1977; Levy 1973; Lintner 1965b, 1969, 1970; Modigliani and Pogue 1974a, b; Mossin 1966; Pettit and Westerfield 1972; Ross 1978a, b, c; Rubinstein 1973, 1974;

Sharpe 1963, 1964, 1966, 1970, 1973, 1991, 1992, 1994; Stapleton 1971; Turnbull 1977) is based on several baseline assumptions. They can be summarized as follows:

1. no transaction costs: it implies that there is no cost (no friction) in the buying or selling of any asset. Introduction of the transaction costs adds to the model complexity. Otherwise, the benefits are not relevant because the transaction costs are usually low. Therefore, costs of their introduction in the model are greater than the benefits;
2. infinite divisibility of the assets: it implies that the quantity of assets are defined and each asset can be divided without any limitations. Therefore, each asset and for each quantity, is tradable. Consequently, investors could take any position in an investment, regardless of the size of wealth. So, it is possible to invest in each asset regardless of the portfolio dimension;
3. marketability of all assets: it implies that all assets, are marketable consequently any asset can be sold and bought on the market;
4. no personal income taxes: it implies that there are no differences between the income from obligations, dividends and capital gains;
5. investor is price-takers: it implies that investor cannot affect the price of the asset through his buying or selling activities. The asset price is defined by the interactions between demand and supply aggregate of all investors' decisions of simultaneously. It is worth noting that since the investor's choices are unable to influence the asset price in the capital markets, this assumption is analogous to the assumption of the perfect competition;
6. mean-variance approach in the portfolio choices: it implies that the portfolio choices are based on the statistical characteristics of the assets with regards to the mean, variance and covariance of their expected returns;
7. homogeneity of expectations: it implies three main consequences. First of all, the investors are assumed to be concerned with the mean and variance of returns by using the same mean-variance approach. Secondly, all investors have the same information and expectations about the statistical characteristics of the assets with regards to their expected returns, the variance of returns and the correlation matrix based on the correlation structure between all stock pairs. Thirdly, all investors define the relevant period in the same manner and then the investment time is equal for all investors;
8. unlimited short sales are allowed: it implies that there are no restrictions on short selling. Consequently, investors can sell short any number of any assets in a given period of time;
9. unlimited lending and borrowing at the risk-free rate: it implies that investors can lend or borrow any amount of funds at a no risk rate.

The CAPM's basic assumptions are rigid and sometimes highly restrictive. In the years several non-standard forms have been tested (Alexander 1977; Arzac and Bawa 1977; Black 1972; Borch 1969; Breeden 1979; Breeden and Litzenberger 1978; Brennan 1971; Brenner and Subrahmanyam 1978; Chamberlain and Rothschild 1983; Chen et al. 1986; Connor 1984; Constantinides 1980; Fama 1970; Fama et al. 1977, 1979; Friend and Westerfield 1980; Grossman and Shiller 1982;

Grossman et al. 1985; Guiso et al. 1996; Hagerman and Kim 1976; Hansen and Singleton 1982; Heckerman 1972; Hilliard 1980; Jarrow 1980; Kraus and Litzenberger 1975; Landskroner 1977a, b; Lintner 1971; Litzenberg and Ronn 1986; Long 1974; Lucas 1978; Mayers 1973, 1976; Merton 1973; Milne and Smith 1980; Rabinovitch and Owel 1978; Ross 1977, 1978a, b, c; Samuelson 1969; Samuelson and Merton 1974; Stapleton and Subrahmanyam 1977).

Despite the assumptions are rigid, they are not the problem in itself. It is not important how realistic they are but, on the contrary, how much the model based on them is able to explain the reality. In this perspective, the right question is how much reality is distorted by the assumption introductions?

The CAPM can be derived in several forms involving different degrees of rigour and mathematical complexity. In this context the two easier approaches are preferred (Elton et al. 2013):

- Intuitive approach: it is based on the economic intuition;
- Rigorous approach: it is based on a simple mathematical form.

# 6.2 Intuitive Approach

The intuitive approach to generate the CAPM is based on the economic intuition (Elton et al. 2013).

Assume that short sales are permitted. Assume the opportunity of investor of lending and borrowing at the risk-free rate. Each investor defines the efficient frontier as shown in Fig. 6.1 (adapted from Elton et al. 2013).

All investors require a portfolio of risky assets (M) regardless of their risk preferences. This portfolio lies at the tangent point between the efficient frontier of risky assets and a straight line passing through the risk-free rate return.

The investor satisfies his risk preferences by combining the portfolio M (portfolio of risky assets) with lending and borrowing at a risk-free rate return.

Investors are characterized by homogeneous expectations. They face the same efficient frontier. Considering that there can only be one risk-free rate in the capital markets (and therefore it is the same for all investors) they also face the same straight line. Therefore, the diagram is the same for all investors. If all investors hold the same risky portfolio (M), then in equilibrium it must be the market portfolio. This portfolio holds all risky assets in the market; each asset is held in the proportion that the market value of that asset represents of the total market value of all risky assets (Elton et al. 2013).

The straight line tangent to the efficient frontier by defining the market portfolio (M) and passing through the risk-free rate, is the Capital Market Line (CML). All efficient portfolios are positioned along the CML. Otherwise, all non-efficient portfolios are positioned below the CML. Finally, there are no portfolios above the CML due to the statistical characteristics of the assets.

Fig. 6.1 Efficient frontier with short selling, and lending and borrowing at a risk free rate

Therefore, based on two mutual fund theorem all investors hold a combination of only two portfolios: the portfolio of risky assets that is the market portfolio  $(M)$  and a risk-free asset. Consequently, all investors can satisfy their risk preferences by considering the market fund and their ability to lend or borrow a risk-free asset.

Note that the risk-free rate is a theoretical construction only. Indeed, a risk-free investment by definition is impossible. But it is necessary to define the market portfolio (M): it is the portfolio on the efficient frontier obtained from the tangent between the efficient frontier and the straight line with interception equal to the risk-free rate. In order to provide a value, the risk-free rate measures the time value of money and it is assumed equal to the government bond return of the country with a default risk low such as to assume it equal to zero.

Denoting with  $R_{pe}$  the expected return of the efficient portfolio positioned on the CML,  $\sigma_{pe}$  the standard deviation of the efficient portfolio;  $R_{F}$  the risk-free rate, the CML's equation can be defined as follows (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
R _ {p e} = R _ {F} + \left(\frac {R _ {M} - R _ {F}}{\sigma_ {M}}\right) \sigma_ {p e} \tag {6.1}
$$

where:

-  $\left(\frac{R_M - R_F}{\sigma_M}\right)$ : it is the slope of the CML and it can be defined as the Sharpe ratio and therefore it can be defined as the "market price of risk" for all efficient portfolios. It can be considered as the extra return that can be gained by increasing the risk (standard deviation) of efficient portfolio by unit (Elton et al. 2013);
-  $\left(\frac{R_M - R_F}{\sigma_M}\right)\sigma_{pe}$ : it can be interpreted as the premium risk and therefore it is the "market price of risk times the amount of risk in portfolio". Therefore, it measures the return required for the portfolio's risk equal to the price of risk multiplied by the amount of risk (Elton et al. 2013).

It is relevant to note that Eq. (6.1) describes the equilibrium returns of the efficient portfolio only. It does not describe the equilibrium returns of non-efficient portfolios or individual asset.

In well diversified portfolios, the coefficient beta is the right measure of the asset's risk. In this case, the asset's specific risk (non-systematic risk) tends to go to zero and the only reliance is its systemic risk as measured by the coefficient beta.

Considering the homogeneous expectations of the investors and unlimited risk-free lending and borrowing, all investors hold the market portfolio. Considering that the market portfolio is a well-diversified portfolio, the only relevant characteristics of the assets are its expected returns and beta (Elton et al. 2013).

Therefore, all assets and portfolios have to stand on a straight line in the beta-return space  $(\beta; R_p)$ . Each point (asset or portfolio) outside of the straight line generates an arbitrage opportunity that moves forward until the price dynamic pushes the point onto a straight line. Indeed, two assets or portfolios that are equivalent cannot sell at different prices.

In Fig. 6.2 (adapted from Elton et al. 2013), point  $D$  (asset or portfolio) has the same risk level as point  $C$  but has a greater expected return. Point  $D$  generates an arbitrage opportunity: point  $C$  is short sold and point  $D$  is acquired. In the same way, if point  $E$  has the same risk level as point  $C$  but has a lower expected return, investors sell short  $E$  and buy  $D$  until point  $D$  goes up onto the line. Generally, the arbitrage opportunities go forward to points  $C$ ,  $D$  and  $E$  positioned on the line. Furthermore, note that point  $C$  represents any combination of points  $A$  and  $B$ . Every combination between two points on the line, generates a new point on the line itself.

Fig. 6.2 Combination of portfolios in the beta-return space

Based on these considerations, all investments and all portfolios of investments must lie along a straight line in the beta-return space. If any investment is positioned above or below that straight line, there is an opportunity for risk-free arbitrage. This arbitrage continues until all investments converge towards the straight line.

There are many ways of defining this straight line. The easiest one is to identify two points (Elton et al. 2013):

- the first is the market portfolio (M). Under the assumptions of CAPM, each investor holds the market portfolio because all portfolios must lie on the straight line. The market portfolio has a beta equal to 1;
- the second is the risk-free rate. It is the point of interception on the vertical axis when the coefficient beta is equal to zero or, in an equivalent form, when the asset's systemic risk is equal to zero. If the asset is characterised by zero systematic risk, it is a risk-free asset (risk-less asset).

These two points identify the straight line, as shown in Fig. 6.3.

The general equation of the straight line is the following:

$$
R = a + b \beta \tag {6.2}
$$

where  $R$  is the expected return.

The first point can be defined by considering that the beta of the market portfolio is equal to 1. Therefore:

$$
\beta_ {\mathrm {M}} = 1 \rightarrow \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {M}} = \mathrm {a} + \mathrm {b} (1) \tag {6.3}
$$

Fig. 6.3 The security market line (SML)

# 6.2 Intuitive Approach

The second point can be defined by considering the interception of the straight line with the vertical axis. This occurs when beta is equal to zero. Therefore:

$$
\beta = 0 \rightarrow \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} = \mathrm {a} + \mathrm {b} (0) \rightarrow \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} = \mathrm {a} \tag {6.4}
$$

By solving Eq. (6.3) for  $b$ , and substituting  $a$  with  $\mathrm{R_F}$  as indicated by Eq. (6.4), we have:

$$
b = \left(R _ {M} - R _ {F}\right) \tag {6.5}
$$

Once the two points are joined, and substituting Eqs. (6.4) and (6.5) in Eq. (6.2), we have:

$$
R = R _ {F} + \beta \left(R _ {M} - R _ {F}\right) \tag {6.6}
$$

Equation (6.6) identifies the Security Market Line (SML). This equation estimates the expected return of each efficient and non-efficient portfolio. This equation is considered one of the most relevant in the field of finance.

It is worth noting that  $R_{M}$  and  $R_{F}$  are not functions of the assets considered. Consequently, the difference between assets is only a function of the coefficient beta that is the measure of the asset's systematic risk. The relationship between the expected return and beta is linear. Therefore, considering that  $R_{M}$  and  $R_{F}$  are not functions of the assets, and considering that the expected return is linear function of the beta, consequently beta and therefore the systematic risk are the only relevant measure and the specific risk (non-systematic risk) is not relevant. In other words, the expected return of the investor is a function of the systematic risk bearing. Therefore, the asset's risk is a function of the part of the variance in the expected returns that cannot be diversified. Consequently, the investor cannot expect an increase in the expected return function of the asset's specific risk. This is an important economic intuition (Elton et al. 2013):

It is relevant to note, that the definition of the SML is function of the definition of beta. If beta is not defined, we have a general straight line and not the SML. In this sense, the expected return of the k-th asset or portfolio is equal to:

$$
R _ {K} = R _ {F} + \beta_ {K} \left(R _ {M} - R _ {F}\right) \tag {6.7}
$$

only if:

$$
\beta_ {K} = \frac {\sigma_ {K , M}}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} \tag {6.8}
$$

and therefore:

$$
R _ {K} = R _ {F} + \left(\frac {\sigma_ {K , M}}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}}\right) \left(R _ {M} - R _ {F}\right) \tag {6.9}
$$

Equation (6.9) can be expressed in a different form as follows:

$$
R _ {K} = R _ {F} + \left(\frac {\sigma_ {K , M}}{\sigma_ {M}}\right) \left(\frac {R _ {M} - R _ {F}}{\sigma_ {M}}\right) \tag {6.10}
$$

where:

-  $\left(\frac{R_M - R_F}{\sigma_M}\right)$  is the Sharpe ratio and can be interpreted as the "market price for the risk";
-  $\left(\frac{\sigma_{K,M}}{\sigma_M}\right)$  is a risk measurement of each asset or portfolio and therefore measures the risk amount of k-th asset. It is the contribution margin to the standard deviation of the portfolio.

If the "market price of the risk" is expressed by variance instead of standard deviation, Eq. (6.9) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
R _ {K} = R _ {F} + \sigma_ {K, M} \left(\frac {R _ {M} - R _ {F}}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}}\right) \tag {6.11}
$$

where:

-  $\left(\frac{\overline{R_M} - R_F}{\sigma_M^2}\right)$  is the "market price of the risk" expressed by variance instead of standard deviation;
-  $(\sigma_{i,M})$  is the risk amount of the k-th asset.

There are four main aspects emerging from Eq. (6.9) and its different forms as in Eqs. (6.10) and (6.11) (Elton et al. 2013):

- First, the difference between the expected return of two different assets is due to their coefficient beta only. In fact,  $R_{F}$  and  $R_{M}$  are equal for both of them. Then, the higher the coefficient beta, the higher the expected return of the asset. It is relevant to note that CAPM is an equilibrium model. The asset with the higher coefficient beta should achieve greater expected returns. But it does not mean that it is always true in all periods. On the contrary, it means that the asset with the higher coefficient beta can generate a low return; the source of the risk lies in this possibility. It is reasonable to expect higher returns on the long term, but not necessarily on the short term;
- second, the relationship between expected return of the asset and its coefficient beta is linear;

# 6.2 Intuitive Approach

- third, the coefficient beta measures systemic risk only. Then, the expected return of the asset is function of the risk systemic only.
- fourth, such as CML, SML estimates the expected return of the asset equal to the sum between the risk-free rate and the market price of the risk multiplied by the risk amount;
- fifth, the systemic risk is the appropriate measure of the asset's risk. Consequently, two assets with the same systemic risk could not offer different rates of return. The non-systemic risk of large diversified portfolio is essentially zero.

# 6.3 Rigorous Approach

The CAPM can be derived on the basis of a rigorous approach by using a mathematical form (Elton et al. 2013). In this context the easier one is considered.

Assume that short sales are allowed. Assume that investors can lend and borrow an unlimited amount of money at the risk-free rate.

The existence of a risk-free lending and borrowing rate implies that there is a single portfolio of risky assets that it is preferred over all other portfolios.

Considering the slope of the straight line connecting a free-risk rate and a risky portfolio and considering that the efficient frontier is the entire length of the ray extending between the risk-free rate and the tangent point between the straight line and the frontier of the efficient portfolios, the slope is equal to (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\theta = \frac {R _ {P} - R _ {F}}{\sigma_ {P}} \tag {6.12}
$$

In this case, it is necessary to define the portfolio that maximizes the slope of the straight line passing through the risk-free rate (on the vertical axes) and the portfolio itself. Therefore, we have:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \max  \theta = \frac {R _ {P} - R _ {F}}{\sigma_ {P}} \\ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i} = 1 \end{array} \right. \tag {6.13}
$$

Considering the constraints in the function, it is possible to maximise directly instead of using the Lagrangian to solve the system (Elton et al. 2013). In this case, the constraint could be substituted with the objective function; then the objective function maximized as in an unconstrained problem.

The risk-free rate  $(R_F)$  can be rewritten as  $R_{F}$  times 1, so that:

$$
R _ {F} = 1 R _ {F} = \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i}\right) R _ {F} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \left(\alpha_ {i} R _ {F}\right) \tag {6.14}
$$

The portfolio's expected return, its variance and standard deviation are the following:

$$
\begin{array}{c} R _ {P} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i} R _ {i} \\ \sigma_ {P} ^ {2} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i, j} \end{array}
$$

$$
\sigma_ {P} = \sqrt {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {j = 1 \atop j \neq i} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i , j}} = \left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {j = 1 \atop j \neq i} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i, j} \right] ^ {\frac {1}{2}}
$$

Explaining, Eq. (6.13) to be maximized, it can be re-written as follows:

$$
\theta = \frac {R _ {P} - R _ {F}}{\sigma_ {P}} = \frac {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i} R _ {i} - \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i} R _ {F}}{\left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\stackrel {j = 1} {j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i , j} \right] ^ {\frac {1}{2}}}
$$

and then:

$$
\theta = \left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i} \left(\bar {R} _ {i} - R _ {F}\right) \right] \left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i, j} \right] ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} \tag{6.15}
$$

Remembering that:

$$
\begin{array}{c} \frac {\partial}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} \left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \alpha_ {i} (R _ {i} - R _ {F}) \right] = R _ {K} - R _ {F} \\ \frac {\partial}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} \left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} \right] = 2 \alpha_ {k} \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} \\ \frac {\partial}{\partial \alpha_ {k}} \left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i, j} \atop j \neq i} \right] = 2 \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {j \neq k} ^ {N} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k, j} \end{array}
$$

# 6.3 Rigorous Approach

the derivative of Eq. (6.15) is equal to:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha_{k}}\left(\left[ \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\alpha_{i}(R_{i} - R_{F})\right]\left[ \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\alpha_{i}^{2}\sigma_{i}^{2} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq i}}^{N}\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{i,j}\right]^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right) \\ = \left\{\left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \left(R _ {i} - R _ {f}\right) \right] \left[ \left(- \frac {1}{2}\right) \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i, j}\right) ^ {- \frac {3}{2}} \left(2 \alpha_ {k} \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} + 2 \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq k}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k, j}\right) \right] \right\} \\ + \left\{\left[ \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i, j}\right) ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} \right] \left[ R _ {K} - R _ {f} \right] \right\} \tag{6.16} \\ \end{array}
$$

Pointing the first derivative equal to zero, we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left\{\left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \left(R _ {i} - R _ {f}\right) \right] \left[ \left(- \frac {1}{2}\right) \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i, j}\right) ^ {- \frac {3}{2}} \left(2 \alpha_ {k} \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} + 2 \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq k}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k, j}\right) \right] \right\} \\ + \left\{\left[ \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i, j}\right) ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} \right] \left[ R _ {K} - R _ {f} \right] \right\} = 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

multiplying the derivative by  $\left[\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i^2 \sigma_i^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^{N} \alpha_i \alpha_j \sigma_{i,j}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right]$ , we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left\{\left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \left(R _ {i} - R _ {f}\right) \right] \left[ \left(- \frac {1}{2}\right) \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {j = 1 \atop j \neq i} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i, j}\right) ^ {- \frac {3}{2}} \left(2 \alpha_ {k} \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} + 2 \sum_ {j = 1 \atop j \neq k} ^ {N} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k, j}\right) \right] \left[ \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {j = 1 \atop j \neq i} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i, j}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \right] \right\} \\ + \left\{\left[ \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} a _ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} a _ {i j} a _ {i j} a _ {i, j}\right) ^ {- \frac {1}{2}} \right] \left[ \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} a _ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} a _ {i j} a _ {i, j} a _ {i, j}\right) ^ {\frac {1}{2}} \right] \left[ R _ {K} - R _ {f} \right] \right\} = 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

and then:

$$

$$

and then:

$$

$$

and then:

$$
\frac {\left[ \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \left(R _ {i} - R _ {f}\right) \right] \left[ (- 1) \left(\alpha_ {k} \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} + \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq k}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k , j}\right) \right]}{\left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i , j}\right)} + \left[ R _ {K} - R _ {f} \right] = 0
$$

and then:

$$
- \left(\frac {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \left(R _ {i} - R _ {f}\right)}{\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i , j}}\right) \left(\alpha_ {k} \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} + \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq k}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k, j}\right) + \left(R _ {K} - R _ {f}\right) = 0 \tag{6.17}
$$

Defining  $\lambda$  as:

$$
\lambda = \frac {\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \left(R _ {i} - R _ {f}\right)}{\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {2} \sigma_ {i} ^ {2} + \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \sum_ {\substack {j = i \\ j \neq i}} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {i , j}} = \frac {R _ {P} - R _ {F}}{\sigma_ {P} ^ {2}} \tag{6.18}
$$

and substituting constant  $\lambda$  in Eq. (6.17), we have:

$$
-\lambda \left(\alpha_{k}\sigma_{k}^{2} + \sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j\neq k}}^{N}\alpha_{j}\sigma_{k,j}\right) + \left(R_{K} - R_{f}\right) = 0
$$

# 6.3 Rigorous Approach

and then:

$$
\left(\lambda \alpha_ {k} \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} + \sum_ {\substack {j = 1 \\ j \neq k}} ^ {N} \lambda \alpha_ {j} \sigma_ {k, j}\right) = \left(R _ {K} - R _ {f}\right) \tag{6.19}
$$

Considering this equation with regards to each asset, a system of simultaneous equations is achieved, as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left(\lambda \alpha_ {1} \sigma_ {1, k} + \lambda \alpha_ {2} \sigma_ {2, k} + \lambda \alpha_ {3} \sigma_ {3, k} + \dots + \lambda \alpha_ {k} \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} + \dots + \lambda \alpha_ {N - 1} \sigma_ {N - 1, k} + \lambda \alpha_ {N} \sigma_ {N, k}\right) \\ = R _ {K} - R _ {F} \\ \end{array}
$$

and then (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\lambda \left(\alpha_ {1} \sigma_ {1, k} + \alpha_ {2} \sigma_ {2, k} + \alpha_ {3} \sigma_ {3, k} + \dots + \alpha_ {k} \sigma_ {k} ^ {2} + \dots + \alpha_ {N - 1} \sigma_ {N - 1, k} + \alpha_ {N} \sigma_ {N, k}\right) = R _ {K} - R _ {F} \tag {6.20}
$$

Therefore, when the derivative of function  $\theta$  was created with regards to each asset in the portfolio and each equation was set equal to zero, a set of simultaneous equations of the form indicated in Eq. (6.20) was created.

For each asset this equation must be true. Therefore the equation number in the system is equal to the number of assets.

If investors are characterized by homogeneous expectations, each of them defines the same optimum portfolio. In conditions of equilibrium, the weight of each asset in this portfolio is equal to its weight in the market. Therefore, the portfolio reproduces the market composition with regards to the assets and their weight (Elton et al. 2013).

Considering that  $\alpha_{i}^{\prime}$  is the weight of i-asset in the market, the market expected return is equal to:

$$
R _ {M} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {\prime} R _ {i} \tag {6.21}
$$

And considering that the covariance between the expected return of the market and the expected return of the k-th asset is equal to:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {K, M} = E \left[ \left(R _ {K} - \overline {{R _ {K}}}\right) \left(R _ {M} - \overline {{R _ {M}}}\right) \right] = \left[ \left(R _ {K} - \overline {{R _ {K}}}\right) \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {\prime} R _ {i} - \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {\prime} \overline {{R}} _ {i}\right) \right] \\ = E \left[ \left(R _ {K} - \bar {R _ {K}}\right) \left(\sum_ {i = 1} ^ {N} \alpha_ {i} ^ {\prime} \left(R _ {i} - \bar {R _ {i}}\right)\right) \right] \tag {6.22} \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $\overline{R_K} \equiv \mu_K$  and  $\overline{R_M} \equiv \mu_M$ , and solving:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {K, M} = E \left[ \alpha_ {1} ^ {\prime} \left(R _ {K} - \overline {{R _ {K}}}\right) \left(R _ {1} - \overline {{R _ {1}}}\right) + \alpha_ {2} ^ {\prime} \left(R _ {K} - \overline {{R _ {K}}}\right) \left(R _ {2} - \overline {{R _ {2}}}\right) + \dots \right. \\ + \alpha_ {k} ^ {\prime} (R _ {K} - \overline {{R _ {K}}}) (R _ {k} - \overline {{R _ {K}}}) + \dots + \alpha_ {N} ^ {\prime} (R _ {K} - \overline {{R _ {K}}}) (R _ {N} - \overline {{R _ {N}}}) ] \\ = \alpha_ {1} ^ {\prime} E \left[ \left(R _ {K} - \overline {{R _ {K}}}\right) \left(R _ {1} - \overline {{R _ {1}}}\right) \right] + \alpha_ {2} ^ {\prime} E \left[ \left(R _ {K} - \overline {{R _ {K}}}\right) \left(R _ {2} - \overline {{R _ {2}}}\right) \right] + \dots \\ + \alpha_ {k} ^ {\prime} E \left[ \left(R _ {K} - \overline {{R _ {K}}}\right) ^ {2} + \dots + \alpha_ {N} ^ {\prime} E \left[ \left(R _ {K} - \overline {{R _ {K}}}\right) \left(R _ {N} - \overline {{R _ {N}}}\right) \right] \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

and then:

$$
\sigma_ {K, M} = \alpha_ {1} ^ {\prime} \sigma_ {1, K} + \alpha_ {2} ^ {\prime} \sigma_ {2, K} + \dots + \alpha_ {N - 1} ^ {\prime} \sigma_ {N - 1, K} + \alpha_ {N} ^ {\prime} \sigma_ {N, K} \tag {6.23}
$$

The left side member of the equation is equal to:

$$
\lambda \left(\alpha_ {1} \sigma_ {1, K} + \alpha_ {2} \sigma_ {2, K} + \alpha_ {3} \sigma_ {3, K} + \dots + \alpha_ {K} \sigma_ {K} ^ {2} + \dots + \alpha_ {N - 1} \sigma_ {N - 1, K} + \alpha_ {N} \sigma_ {N, K}\right) = \lambda \sigma_ {K, M}
$$

And therefore Eq. (6.23) can be re-written as follows (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\lambda \sigma_ {K, M} = \overline {{R _ {K}}} - R _ {F} \tag {6.24}
$$

This equation must be true for each k-th asset. It implies that the equation must be true for each portfolio and therefore also for the market portfolio (Elton et al. 2013).

Particularly for the market portfolio the relationship is the following:

$$
\sigma_ {m, m} = \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} \rightarrow \lambda \sigma_ {M} ^ {2} = \overline {{R _ {M}}} - R _ {F}
$$

and therefore:

$$
\lambda = \frac {\overline {{R _ {M}}} - R _ {F}}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}}
$$

By substituting  $\lambda$ , the Eq. (6.24) can be re-written as follows:

$$
\frac {\overline {{R _ {M}}} - R _ {F}}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} \sigma_ {K, M} = \overline {{R _ {K}}} - R _ {F}
$$

and solving by  $R_{k}$

# 6.3 Rigorous Approach

$$
\overline {{R _ {K}}} = R _ {F} + \frac {\overline {{R _ {M}}} - R _ {F}}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} \sigma_ {K, M} \tag {6.25}
$$

or in equal form:

$$
\overline {{R _ {K}}} = R _ {F} + \left(\overline {{R _ {M}}} - R _ {F}\right) \frac {\sigma_ {K , M}}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} \tag {6.26}
$$

Considering that:

$$
\beta_ {k} = \frac {\sigma_ {K , M}}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}} \tag {6.27}
$$

Equation (6.26) can be re-written as follows:

$$
\overline {{R _ {K}}} = R _ {F} + \beta_ {k} (\overline {{R _ {M}}} - R _ {F}) \tag {6.28}
$$

Equation (6.28) is the equation of the Security Market Line (SML).

Therefore, the intuitive and rigorous construction of the CAPM achieve the same result.

# 6.4 Capm in Terms of Prices

The CAPM is the equilibrium model of the capital markets in terms of prices and also in terms of expected returns.

The asset's return is a function of its price over time. Therefore, it is possible to define the CAPM in terms of prices. Consequently the CAPM is useful to describe the equilibrium condition in the capital markets in terms of both expected returns and prices (Elton et al. 2013).

It is relevant in many situations as the evaluation or definition of the emission price of a new asset for example. The derivation of the equilibrium condition based on prices starts with the equilibrium condition based on expected returns.

Using  $P_{i}$  to denote the current price of the asset and  $Y_{i}$  the expected price of the asset in the future (next year) it also includes the dividends that will be paid and therefore measures its value in monetary terms. The expected return of the i-th asset  $(R_{i})$  is equal to (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
R _ {i} = \frac {Y _ {i} - P _ {i}}{P _ {i}} = \frac {Y _ {i}}{P _ {i}} - \frac {P _ {i}}{P _ {i}} = \frac {Y _ {i}}{P _ {i}} - 1 \tag {6.29}
$$

Similarly, by using  $P_{M}$  to denote the current market price and  $Y_{M}$  the expected price of the market portfolio in the future (next year) also including the dividends

that will be paid and therefore measures its value in monetary terms, the expected return of the market  $(R_M)$  is equal to (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
R _ {M} = \frac {Y _ {M} - P _ {M}}{P _ {M}} = \frac {Y _ {M}}{P _ {M}} - \frac {P _ {M}}{P _ {M}} = \frac {Y _ {M}}{P _ {M}} - 1 \tag {6.30}
$$

Based on Eq. (6.26), the expected return of the i-th asset  $(R_{i})$  is equal to:

$$
R _ {i} = R _ {F} + \left(\frac {\sigma_ {i , M}}{\sigma_ {M} ^ {2}}\right) \left(R _ {M} - R _ {F}\right) \tag {6.31}
$$

substituting  $R_{i}$  and  $R_{M}$  with their formalization respectively, and explaining it with regards to the expected returns of i-th asset and portfolio market the covariance  $(\sigma_{(R_i;R_M)})$  and variance  $(\sigma_{(R_M)}^2)$ , the equation can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\frac {Y _ {i}}{P _ {i}} - 1 = R _ {F} + \left(\frac {\sigma_ {\left(R _ {i} ; R _ {M}\right)}}{\sigma_ {\left(R _ {M}\right)} ^ {2}}\right) \left(\frac {Y _ {M}}{P _ {M}} - 1 - R _ {F}\right) \tag {6.32}
$$

The covariance between the expected returns of the i-th asset and the expected returns of the market portfolio  $(\sigma_{(R_i;R_M)})$ , (where  $\overline{R_i} \equiv \mu_i$  and  $\overline{R_M} \equiv \mu_M$ ), can be re-written as follows (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {\left(R _ {i}; R _ {M}\right)} = E \left[ \left(R _ {i} - \bar {R} _ {i}\right) \left(R _ {M} - \bar {R} _ {M}\right) \right] = E \left[ \left(\frac {Y _ {i} - P _ {i}}{P _ {i}} - \frac {\bar {Y} _ {i} - P _ {i}}{P _ {i}}\right) \left(\frac {Y _ {M} - P _ {M}}{P _ {M}} - \frac {\bar {Y} _ {M} - P _ {M}}{P _ {M}}\right) \right] \\ = E \left[ \left(\frac {Y _ {i}}{P _ {i}} - 1 - \left(\frac {\bar {Y} _ {i}}{P _ {i}} - 1\right)\right) \left(\frac {Y _ {M}}{P _ {M}} - 1 - \left(\frac {\bar {Y} _ {M}}{P _ {M}} - 1\right)\right) \right] = E \left[ \left(\frac {Y _ {i}}{P _ {i}} - \frac {\bar {Y} _ {i}}{P _ {i}}\right) \left(\frac {Y _ {M}}{P _ {M}} - \frac {\bar {Y} _ {M}}{P _ {M}}\right) \right] \\ = E \left[ \left(\frac {Y _ {i} - \bar {Y} _ {i}}{P _ {i}}\right) \left(\frac {Y _ {M} - \bar {Y} _ {M}}{P _ {M}}\right) \right] = E \left[ \frac {1}{P _ {i}} \left(Y _ {i} - \bar {Y} _ {i}\right) \frac {1}{P _ {M}} \left(Y _ {M} - \bar {Y} _ {M}\right) \right] \\ = \frac {1}{P _ {i}} \frac {1}{P _ {M}} E \left[ \left(Y _ {i} - \bar {Y} _ {i}\right) \left(Y _ {M} - \bar {Y} _ {M}\right) \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

and then:

$$
\sigma_ {\left(R _ {i}; R _ {M}\right)} = \frac {1}{P _ {i}} \frac {1}{P _ {M}} \sigma_ {\left(Y _ {i}; Y _ {M}\right)} \tag {6.33}
$$

where  $\sigma_{(Y_i;Y_M)}$  is the covariance between the future price of the i-th asset and the market portfolio.

Similarly, the variance of the market portfolio expected returns  $\left(\sigma_{(R_M)}^2\right)$  can be re-written as follows (Elton et al. 2013):

# 6.4 Capm in Terms of Prices

$$
\begin{array}{l} \sigma_ {(R _ {M})} ^ {2} = E \left[ \left(R _ {M} - \overline {{R _ {M}}}\right) ^ {2} \right] = E \left[ \left(\frac {Y _ {M} - P _ {M}}{P _ {M}} - \frac {\overline {{Y _ {M}}} - P _ {M}}{P _ {M}}\right) ^ {2} \right] = E \left[ \left(\frac {Y _ {M}}{P _ {M}} - 1 - \left(\frac {\overline {{Y _ {M}}}}{P _ {M}} - 1\right)\right) ^ {2} \right] \\ = E \left[ \left(\frac {Y _ {M}}{P _ {M}} - \frac {\overline {{Y _ {M}}}}{P _ {M}}\right) ^ {2} \right] = E \left[ \left(\frac {1}{P _ {M}}\right) ^ {2} \left(Y _ {M} - \overline {{Y _ {M}}}\right) ^ {2} \right] = E \left[ \frac {1}{P _ {M} ^ {2}} \left(Y _ {M} - \overline {{Y _ {M}}}\right) ^ {2} \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

and then:

$$
\sigma_ {\left(R _ {M}\right)} ^ {2} = \frac {1}{P _ {M} ^ {2}} \sigma_ {\left(Y _ {M}\right)} ^ {2} \tag {6.34}
$$

where  $\sigma_{Y_M}^2$  is the variance of the future price of the market portfolio.

On the basis of Eqs. (6.33) and (6.34), Eq. (6.32) can be re-written as follows:

$$
\frac {\bar {Y} _ {i}}{P _ {i}} - 1 = R _ {F} + \left(\frac {\bar {Y} _ {M}}{P _ {M}} - 1 - R _ {F}\right) \frac {\frac {1}{P _ {i}} \frac {1}{P _ {M}} \sigma_ {(Y _ {i}; Y _ {M})}}{\frac {1}{P _ {M} ^ {2}} \sigma_ {(Y _ {M})} ^ {2}} \tag {6.35}
$$

Adding 1 to each term, we have:

$$
\frac {\overline {{Y}} _ {i}}{P _ {i}} - 1 + 1 = R _ {F} + \left(\frac {\overline {{Y _ {M}}}}{P _ {M}} - 1 - R _ {F}\right) \frac {\frac {1}{P _ {i}} \frac {1}{P _ {M}} \sigma_ {(Y _ {i}; Y _ {M})}}{\frac {1}{P _ {M} ^ {2}} \sigma_ {(Y _ {M})} ^ {2}} + 1
$$

defining  $r_F = 1 + R_F$  and substituting, we have:

$$
\frac {\overline {{Y}} _ {i}}{P _ {i}} = r _ {F} + \left(\frac {\overline {{Y _ {M}}}}{P _ {M}} - r _ {F}\right) \frac {\frac {1}{P _ {i}} \frac {1}{P _ {M}} \sigma_ {(Y _ {i} ; Y _ {M})}}{\frac {1}{P _ {M} ^ {2}} \sigma_ {(Y _ {M})} ^ {2}}
$$

Multiplying each term for  $P_{i}$ , we have:

$$
P _ {i} \frac {\bar {Y} _ {i}}{P _ {i}} = \left[ r _ {F} + \left(\frac {\bar {Y} _ {M}}{P _ {M}} - r _ {F}\right) \frac {\frac {1}{P _ {i}} \frac {1}{P _ {M}} \sigma_ {(Y _ {i}; Y _ {M})}}{\frac {1}{P _ {M} ^ {2}} \sigma_ {(Y _ {M})} ^ {2}} \right] P _ {i}
$$

and then:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \bar {Y} _ {i} = r _ {F} P _ {i} + \left(\frac {\overline {{Y _ {M}}} - r _ {F} P _ {M}}{P _ {M}}\right) \frac {\frac {1}{P _ {i}} \frac {1}{P _ {M}} \sigma_ {(Y _ {i} ; Y _ {M})} P _ {i}}{\frac {1}{P _ {M} ^ {2}} \sigma_ {(Y _ {M})} ^ {2}} = r _ {F} P _ {i} + \left(\frac {\overline {{Y _ {M}}} - r _ {F} P _ {M}}{P _ {M}}\right) \frac {\frac {1}{P _ {M}} \sigma_ {(Y _ {i} ; Y _ {M})}}{\frac {1}{P _ {M} ^ {2}} \sigma_ {(Y _ {M})} ^ {2}} \\ = r _ {F} P _ {i} + \left(\frac {\overline {{Y _ {M}}} - r _ {F} P _ {M}}{P _ {M}}\right) \frac {\sigma_ {(Y _ {i} ; Y _ {M})}}{\frac {1}{P _ {M}} \sigma_ {(Y _ {M})} ^ {2}} = r _ {F} P _ {i} + \left(\frac {\overline {{Y _ {M}}} - r _ {F} P _ {M}}{P _ {M}}\right) P _ {M} \frac {\sigma_ {(Y _ {i} ; Y _ {M})}}{\sigma_ {(Y _ {M})} ^ {2}} \\ = r _ {F} P _ {i} + \left(\overline {{Y _ {M}}} - r _ {F} P _ {M}\right) \frac {\sigma_ {\left(Y _ {i} ; Y _ {M}\right)}}{\sigma_ {\left(Y _ {M}\right)} ^ {2}} \\ \end{array}
$$

and by solving for  $P_{i}$  , we have (Elton et al. 2013):

$$
P _ {i} = \frac {1}{r _ {F}} \left[ \bar {Y} _ {i} - \left(\bar {Y _ {M}} - r _ {F} P _ {M}\right) \frac {\sigma_ {\left(Y _ {i} ; Y _ {M}\right)}}{\sigma_ {\left(Y _ {M}\right)} ^ {2}} \right] \tag {6.36}
$$

Equation (6.36) shows how the current price of the i-th asset  $(P_{i})$  is function of its expected price and therefore of its expected value in monetary terms  $\left(\overline{Y}_i\right)$  less an amount for risk  $\left(\left(\overline{Y_M} - r_F P_M\right) \frac{\sigma_{(Y_i; Y_M)}}{\sigma_{(Y_M)}^2}\right)$ ; this difference is achieved by using  $r_F$  and then  $\left(\frac{1}{r_F}\right)$ .  $r_F$  can be used in order to estimate the present value because the term  $\left[\overline{Y}_i - (\overline{Y_M} - r_F P_M) \frac{\sigma_{(Y_i; Y_M)}}{\sigma_{(Y_M)}^2}\right]$  can be considered as the certain equivalent of the future value (Elton et al. 2013).

Equation (6.36) can be written in a different form as follows:

$$
P _ {i} = \frac {1}{r _ {F}} \left[ \bar {Y} _ {i} - \left(\frac {\bar {Y} _ {M} - r _ {F} P _ {M}}{\sigma_ {(Y _ {M})}}\right) \frac {\sigma_ {(Y _ {i} ; Y _ {M})}}{\sigma_ {(Y _ {M})}} \right] \tag {6.37}
$$

where:

$\frac{\overline{y_M} - r_F P_M}{\sigma(y_M)}$  is the "market price for the risk";
$-\frac{\sigma_{(Y_i;Y_M)}}{\sigma_{(Y_M)}}$  is the measure of risk for any i-th asset.
