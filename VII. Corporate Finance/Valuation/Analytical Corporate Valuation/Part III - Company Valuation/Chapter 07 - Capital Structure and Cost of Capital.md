Abstract The cost of capital is one of the most relevant variables in the company's valuation models. It is probably one of the most relevant topics for managers and financial economists. For decades several studies have focused on the relationship between capital structure, cost of capital and company value. Despite a broad experience approach in both academic and practices, it should not be surprising that the method for estimation of the cost of capital is still under intensive discussion. In this context, starting with the Modigliani and Miller theories, whose studies are considered the starting point of the modern theory of capital structure, the cost of equity, debt and company capital are estimated.

# 7.1 Capital Structure Choices

The capital structure of a company refers to the capital sources invested in it. There are two main sources of capital: equity, through stock emission; debt, through the emission of bonds.

Equity and debt are different in their nature, level of risk and rights.

By purchasing equity, the stockholders become the owners of the company. They have the right to vote and share and future profits of the company. More specifically, equity is a source of capital characterised by:

- heterogeneity: it can be internal, arising from self-financing due to the retention of earnings, or external, deriving from the emission of new shares;
- long-period: it is stable over time in the capital structure of the company and it is intended to fund long-term company activities;
- full riskiness: the owners bear the income risk, function of the probability of "non-congruity" of remuneration and capital risk, function of the probability to lose capital invested in the case of default;
- variable remuneration: the dividends for stockholders are uncertain in their amount and time of achievement;
- indirect refund: the stakeholders achieve capital gain/loss by selling the stocks in the capital markets based on the difference between the sales prices and the buying price.

On the other hand, by purchasing the debt the bondholders become company creditors. They do not share in the profit of the company but they receive the main plus defined interest. More specifically, the debt is a capital source characterised by:

- homogeneity: it is an external source of capital;
- short and long period: it can be a long-term debt, and therefore it is a stable source of capital in the capital structure, or a short-term debt;
- limited riskiness: the owners bear the default risk only. The obligations on debts must be paid regardless of the company's income performance. Also, in the case of bankruptcy, bondholders must be paid before stockholders;
- fixed remuneration: the interest on debt for bondholders is certain in the amount and in time of achievement;
- direct refund: the company must reimburse the principal at maturity.

Based on these main characteristics, stocks are riskier than bonds. Consequently, the expected return on equity must be higher than the expected return on debt.

One of the most relevant problems of capital structure, includes the effects of its choices on company value. The main question refers to both positive and negative debt effects on the value of the company.

The relationship between capital structure choices and company value has confused financial economists and managements for decades. Despite the vast theoretical models and decades of empirical tests, the problem still exists and it is feasible to say that the capital structure choices of companies are still "puzzle" (Myers 1984). The question continued to involve the financial and managerial economists, with regards to the techniques of company financing and capital budgeting problems and the economic theorists, with regards to the explanation of interest, savings and investment behaviours on both the micro and macro levels.

The starting point of the modern capital structure theory, is usually considered the theory of Modigliani and Miller (MM). It was developed over time on the basis of five main papers:

(1) the first and the most popular paper is "The Cost of Capital, Corporate Finance and the Theory of Investment" (1958), in which MM define the well-known Propositions I and II;
(2) the second is the "Dividend Policy, Growth, and the Valuation of Shares" (1961), in which MM try to complete and refine the analysis of the Propositions;
(3) the third is a "Corporate Income Taxes and the Cost of Capital: a Correction" (1963), that is "a correction" of the previous Paper (1958), in which MM defines new conclusions on the Propositions I and II after the introduction of corporate taxes;

(4) the fourth is the "Debt and Taxes" (1977) by Miller only, in which he introduces personal taxes in addition to corporate taxes;
(5) the fifth is the "Debt, Dividend Policy, Taxes, Inflation and Market Valuation" (1982) by Modigliani only, in which he revises the 1963 version of the Propositions.

The Propositions I and II are the core of their theory. The basic idea of MM is that company value is function of its business operating activities only, and the capital structure defines the way in which this value is distributed between the investors in equity and debt. Thus, the capital structure choices are irrelevant both with regards to the company value and its capital cost (Propositions I and II).

Note that the Propositions of MM comply with the law of preservation of investment value: in the absence of corporate taxes, the company value is function of operating cash-flow only; the way in which these cash-flows are distributed among different investors is irrelevant in the perspective of company value. Therefore, the company's assets cannot be influenced by the composition of capital structure in terms of equity and debt amounts. Based on this argument, the cost of capital is generated. If the value of the assets is independent of the capital structure choices, the discount rate of the operating cash-flows cannot be influenced by the relationship between equity and debt.

The Propositions I and II (MM 1958), are based on strong and restrictive assumptions. To derive these two Propositions, it is useful to follow strictly MM's argumentations sometimes by using the same words and symbols used in their papers. The main basic assumptions can be schematically summarized as follows:

(1) assume an economy in which all physical assets are owned by companies;
(2) assume that these companies finance their assets by issuing common stocks only. Assets will provide stockholders with a flow of profit over time. However, this flow of profit will not be constant and it is uncertain. At a later stage, this assumption is eliminated and is replaced with assumption 3;
(3) assume that the company can be financed by equity and debt. Specifically, assume that: (i) all bonds yield a constant income per unit of time, and this income is regarded as certain by all traders regardless of the issuer. Therefore, all bonds are perfect substitutes up to a scale factor; (ii) all bonds, as well as stocks, are traded in a perfect capital market. Therefore, they must all sell at the same price per dollar's worth of return, or equivalently, they must yield the same rate of return. This rate of return referred to as the rate of interest, or equivalently, as the capitalization rate for sure streams;
(4) assume that this stream of income (and hence the stream of income accruing to any share of common stock) can be extended indefinitely into the future but its mean value over time (the average profit per unit of time) is infinite and represents a random variable subject to a subjective probability distribution. Therefore: (i) the return of the share is defined equal to the average value over time of the stream of income accruing to a given share; (ii) the expected return of the share is defined equal to the mathematical expectation of this average value. Therefore the uncertainty connects with the mean value over time of the

stream of income and it must not confused with the variability over time of the successive elements of the stream;

(5) assume that the investors agree on the expected return of any share despite the fact that they may have a different probability distribution of the return of any share;
(6) assume that firms can be divided into "equivalent return classes": the return on the shares issued by any company in the same class is proportional to the return on the shares issued by any other company in the same class; the returns on shares as perfectly correlated between them. Therefore, the shares within the same class differ between them by one scale factor at the most. Consequently, if we consider the ratio between the return and the expected return, the probability distribution of the ratio is the same for all shares within the same class. Consequently, there are only two relevant properties of a share: (i) the reference class; (ii) its expected return;

This assumption is probably the most relevant of the model, because it allows for classification of the companies within which the shares of different companies are homogeneous, and therefore perfect substitutes among them. In other words, the assumption allows for the creation of homogeneous classes of stock;

(7) assume that the shares are traded in the perfect capital markets under conditions of atomistic competition;
(8) assume the opportunity for an investor to borrow at the same conditions as the company. Therefore, the investor can reproduce the same company leverage in its portfolio by borrowing on a personal level.

Based on these basic assumptions, in conditions of equilibrium, the price of every share in any given class must be proportional to its expected return. This "proportionality factor" for any class is the same for all companies within the class.

Using  $p_j$  to denote the price per share of the  $j$ -th company in the  $k$ -th class and with  $x_j$  the expected return per share of the  $j$ -th firm in the  $k$ -th class, we have:

$$
p _ {j} = \frac {1}{p _ {k}} x _ {j} \rightarrow p _ {k} = \frac {x _ {i}}{p _ {j}} \tag {7.1}
$$

where  $1 / p_{k}$  is the proportionality factor for any k-th class. Specifically,  $p_{k}$  is a constant for all j-firms in the k-class and it is one for each of the k-classes; then, it is the same for all companies in the same k-th class.

Therefore in the same class, the price per share of the j-th company  $(p_j)$  is proportional to its expected return  $(x_j)$  based on the proportionality factor  $(1 / p_k)$  that is the same for all companies within the same k-th class.

Based on the equation,  $p_k$  it can be interpreted as the price that an investor has to pay for a dollar's worth of expected return in the k-th class. In equivalent terms,  $p_k$  can be regarded as the market rate of capitalization for the expected value of uncertain streams of the kind generated by the k-th class of companies. Consequently,  $p_k$  can be interpreted as the expected rate of return of any share in the k-th class.

Having defined the concept of homogeneous classes of shares, and therefore having defined the instruments to face the uncertain stream, it is possible to remove assumption n.2 by replacing it with assumption n.3. Therefore, assume that the company can be financed by equity and debt. The introduction of debt modifies market shares. Companies may have a different capital structure and therefore a different debt level. Therefore, shares of different companies can give rise to different probability return distributions, even if they are in the same class. The shares will be subject to different degrees of leverage and therefore financial risk. Consequently, they will no longer be perfect substitutes among them.

Based on these assumptions and considerations, MM (1958) have derived the two Propositions.

Proposition I: the market value of any company is independent of its capital structure and is created by capitalizing its expected return at the rate  $(p_k)$  appropriate to its class.

Equivalently, the average cost of capital to any company is completely independent of its capital structure and is equal to the capitalization rate of a pure equity stream of its class.

In conditions of equilibrium, the company levered value  $(W_{L})$  is equal to the company unlevered value  $(W_{U})$ , equal to the market value of the company  $(W_{j})$ , as follows:

$$
W _ {L} = W _ {U} = W _ {j} \tag {7.2}
$$

and by denoting with  $X_{j}$  the expected return of the j-company's assets and therefore the expected return of income;  $D_{j}$  the market value of the debt of the j-company;  $E_{j}$  is the marker value of the equity of the j-company;  $p_{k}$  is the expected rate of return of the stock of the k-th class of the j-company referenced that is constant for all companies within the same k-th class and it is one for each k-th class, we have:

$$
W _ {j} \equiv (E _ {j} + D _ {j}) = \frac {X _ {j}}{p _ {k}} \rightarrow p _ {k} = \frac {X _ {j}}{(E _ {j} + D _ {j})} \equiv \frac {X _ {j}}{W _ {j}} \tag {7.3}
$$

where  $X_{j} / W_{j}$  is the "average cost of capital". It is constant for all firms in the same k-th class, and therefore it is independent from the capital structure of the company.

The Proposition I can be proved by considering two companies:

- Company 1: is financed by equity only, and therefore it is defined as an Unlevered Firm  $(F_U)$ ;
- Company 2: is financed by equity and debt, and therefore it is defined as a Levered Firm  $(F_L)$ .

Assume that these two companies are in the same k-class. Therefore, the expected returns of Company 1  $(X_{1})$  and Company 2  $(X_{2})$  are equal among them: the two companies in the same k-th class have the same expected return  $(X)$  as follows:

$$
X _ {1} \equiv X _ {2} = X \tag {7.4}
$$

Now it is possible to analyse two main cases:

- (Case 1) assume that the value of the Company  $2(W_{2})$  is higher than the value of Company  $1(W_{1})$ , and therefore the value of the levered company  $(W_{L})$  is higher than the value of the unlevered company  $(W_{U})$ . This first case can be formalized as follows:

$$
W _ {2} > W _ {1} \leftrightarrow W _ {L} > W _ {U}
$$

- (Case 1) assume that the value of Company 1  $(W_{1})$  is higher than the value of Company 2  $(W_{2})$ , and therefore the value of the unlevered company  $(W_{U})$  is higher than the value of the levered company  $(W_{L})$ . This second case can be formalized as follows:

$$
W _ {1} > W _ {2} \leftrightarrow W _ {U} > W _ {L}
$$

# Case 1

Assume the following basic relationship between the two companies:

$$
W _ {2} \equiv W _ {L} > W _ {1} \equiv W _ {U} \tag {7.5}
$$

Assume that the investor holds an amount  $(e_2)$  of shares of Company 2 (Levered Company). This amount represents a fraction  $(\alpha)$  of the total equity  $(E_2)$  of Company 2 as follows:

$$
e _ {2} = \alpha E _ {2} \rightarrow \alpha = \frac {e _ {2}}{E _ {2}} \tag {7.6}
$$

Therefore, the return on investment and therefore the return of the investor's portfolio  $(Y_{2})$  is a fraction  $(\alpha)$  of the income of Company 2 available for the stockholders that is equal to the total return  $(X)$  less the interest charge that is equal to rate return of debt  $(r)$  multiplied by the debt  $(D)$  in the capital structure, as follows:

$$
Y _ {2} = \alpha (X - r D) \tag {7.7}
$$

Assume that the investor decides to sell his share of Company 2 ( $e_2 = \alpha E_2$ ) and acquire an amount of the equity of Company 1 ( $\alpha_1 = \frac{e_1}{E_1}$ ). To acquire a portion of the equity of Company 1, the investor uses the amount derived from the sale of shares of Company 2 ( $\alpha E_2$ ) plus a personal debt by using new shares in Company 1 as a collateral ( $\alpha D_2$ ). In this context the assumption refers to the opportunity for the investor to borrow at the same conditions as the company plays a central role.

Based on this, the investor can reproduce the same company leverage in its portfolio by borrowing on a personal level.

Therefore, the investor acquires a fraction of the equity of Company 1 and its income, as follows:

$$
\frac {e _ {1}}{E _ {1}} = \frac {\alpha E _ {2} + \alpha D _ {2}}{E _ {1}} = \frac {\alpha \left(E _ {2} + D _ {2}\right)}{E _ {1}} \tag {7.8}
$$

where  $\alpha(E_2 + D_2)$  is the amount invested to acquire a fraction of the equity of Company 1.

By considering the interest payments on personal debt  $(\alpha D_2)$ , the return of the investor's portfolio is equal to:

$$
Y _ {1} = \frac {\alpha \left(E _ {2} + D _ {2}\right)}{E _ {1}} X - r \left(\alpha D _ {2}\right) \tag {7.9}
$$

Company 1 is financed by equity only. Subsequently, the equity value  $(E_{1})$  is equal to the company value  $(W_{1})$  that it is equal to the company unlevered value  $(W_{U})$  as follows:

$$
E _ {1} = W _ {1} \equiv W _ {U} \tag {7.10}
$$

Company 2 is financed by debt and equity. Subsequently, the sum of equity value  $(E_2)$  and debt value  $(D_2)$  is equal to the company value  $(W_2)$  that it is equal to the company levered value  $(W_L)$  as follows:

$$
E _ {2} + D _ {2} = W _ {2} \equiv W _ {L} \tag {7.11}
$$

On the basis of Eqs. (7.10) and (7.11), Eq. (7.9) can be re-written as follows:

$$
Y _ {1} = \alpha \frac {W _ {2}}{W _ {1}} X - r \alpha D _ {2} = \alpha \left(\frac {W _ {2}}{W _ {1}} X - r D _ {2}\right) \tag {7.12}
$$

The Case 1 basic assumption is that the value of Company 2  $(W_{2})$  is higher than the value of Company 1  $(W_{1})$ . Consequently, the ratio between the value of Company 2 and the value of Company 1 is positive as follows:

$$
W _ {2} > W _ {1} \rightarrow \frac {W _ {2}}{W _ {1}} > 0 \tag {7.13}
$$

By looking at the returns of Portfolio 1  $(Y_{1})$  and Portfolio 2  $(Y_{2})$ , the relationship is the following:

$$
Y _ {1} = \alpha \left(\frac {W _ {2}}{W _ {1}} X - r D _ {2}\right) > Y _ {2} = \alpha (X - r D) \tag {7.14}
$$

Therefore, as long as the value of Company 2 (Levered Value) is higher than the value of Company 1 (Unlevered Value), the return of Portfolio 1 ( $Y_{1}$ ) is higher than the return of Portfolio 2 ( $Y_{2}$ ) as follows:

$$
W _ {2} \equiv W _ {L} > W _ {1} \equiv W _ {U} \rightarrow Y _ {1} > Y _ {2} \tag {7.15}
$$

In this situation, there are conditions for arbitrage: the investor sells the shares of Company 2 (with subsequent depreciation of  $E_{2}$  and therefore  $W_{2}$ ) and acquires shares of Company 1 (with subsequent increase of  $E_{1}$  and therefore  $W_{1}$ ). This movement continues until the value of the two firms are aligned in a new equilibrium condition that will be equal:

$$
W _ {2} \equiv W _ {L} = W _ {1} \equiv W _ {U} \tag {7.16}
$$

It is worth noting, that the levered company (Company 2) cannot command a premium over an unlevered company (Company 1) because investors can replace the company leverage (of Company 2) into their portfolio directly by borrowing on a personal account. Indeed, investors and companies have the opportunity to borrow at the same conditions.

# Case 2

Assume the following baseline relationship between the two companies:

$$
W _ {2} \equiv W _ {L} <   W _ {1} \equiv W _ {U} \tag {7.17}
$$

Assume that the investor initially owns an amount  $(e_1)$  of shares of Company 1 (Unlevered Company). It is a fraction  $(\alpha)$  of the total equity  $(E_1)$  of Company 1, as follows:

$$
e _ {1} = \alpha E _ {1} \rightarrow \alpha = \frac {e _ {1}}{E _ {1}} \tag {7.18}
$$

The investor's return based on the Portfolio  $1(Y_{1})$  is equal to:

$$
Y _ {1} = \alpha X \rightarrow Y _ {1} = \frac {e _ {1}}{E _ {1}} X \tag {7.19}
$$

Assume that the investor decides to exchange his portfolio with another one of the same value equal to  $e_1$  and consisting of  $e_2$  dollars of shares of Company 2 and of  $d$  dollars of bonds. In this context,  $e_2$  and  $d$  are given by:

# 7.1 Capital Structure Choices

$$
e _ {2} = \frac {E _ {2}}{W _ {2}} e _ {1}; \quad d = \frac {D _ {2}}{W _ {2}} e _ {1} \tag {7.20}
$$

Therefore, the investor's wealth  $(e_1)$  is invested in a portfolio consisting of shares of Company 2  $(e_2)$  and bonds  $(d)$  proportionally respectively to the value of equity on the total levered value  $(E_2 / W_2)$ , and the value of debt on the total levered value  $(D_2 / W_2)$  of Company 2.

In this case:

- the return on shares  $(R_S)$  will be a fraction  $(\alpha)$  (equal to the shares owned by the investor  $(e_2)$  on the total value of the equity of Company 2  $(E_2)$  so that:  $\alpha = e_2 / E_2$  ) of the total return of the stockholders of Company 2 (equal to the total return of assets  $(X)$  less the rate return  $(r)$  on debt  $(D_{2})$  of Company 2 so that:  $X - rD_{2}$ ) as follows:

$$
R _ {S} = \frac {e _ {2}}{E _ {2}} (X - r D _ {2}) \tag {7.21}
$$

- the return from the bonds  $(R_B)$  will be equal to the rate return  $(r)$  on bonds  $(d)$  as follows:

$$
R _ {B} = r d \tag {7.22}
$$

Therefore, the total return of the Portfolio 2  $(Y_{2})$  is equal to:

$$
Y _ {2} = \frac {e _ {2}}{E _ {2}} (X - r D _ {2}) + r d \tag {7.23}
$$

Substituting  $e_2$  and  $d$  with their expressions as defined in Eq. (7.20) in Eq. (7.23) we have

$$
\begin{array}{l} Y _ {2} = \frac {\frac {E _ {2}}{W _ {2}} e _ {1}}{E _ {2}} (X - r D _ {2}) + r \frac {D _ {2}}{W _ {2}} e _ {1} = \frac {E _ {2}}{W _ {2} E _ {2}} e _ {1} (X - r D _ {2}) + r \frac {D _ {2}}{W _ {2}} e _ {1} = \frac {e _ {1}}{W _ {2}} (X - r D _ {2}) + r \frac {D _ {2}}{W _ {2}} e _ {1} \\ = \frac {e _ {1}}{W _ {2}} X - \frac {e _ {1}}{W _ {2}} r D _ {2} + r \frac {D _ {2}}{W _ {2}} e _ {1} = \frac {e _ {1}}{W _ {2}} X - \frac {1}{W _ {2}} e _ {1} r D _ {2} + \frac {1}{W _ {2}} e _ {1} r D _ {2} = \frac {e _ {1}}{W _ {2}} X \\ \end{array}
$$

Remembering that  $e_1 = \alpha E_1$ , we have:

$$
Y _ {2} = \frac {\alpha E _ {1}}{W _ {2}} X = \alpha \frac {E _ {1}}{W _ {2}} X \tag {7.24}
$$

Company 1 is unlevered. Therefore, the equity value  $(E_1)$  is equal to the company value  $(W_1)$ , so that:

$$
Y _ {2} = \alpha \frac {W _ {1}}{W _ {2}} X \tag {7.25}
$$

The Case 2 basic assumption is that the value of Company 1  $(W_{1})$  is higher than the value of Company 2  $(W_{2})$ . Then, the ratio between the value of Company 2 and the value of Company 1 is positive as follows:

$$
W _ {1} > W _ {2} \rightarrow \frac {W _ {1}}{W _ {2}} > 0 \tag {7.26}
$$

By looking at the returns of Portfolio 1  $(Y_{1})$  and Portfolio 2  $(Y_{2})$ , the relationship is the following:

$$
Y _ {2} = \alpha \frac {W _ {1}}{W _ {2}} X > Y _ {1} = \alpha X \tag {7.27}
$$

Therefore, by assuming that the value of Company 1 (Company Unlevered Value) is higher than the value of Company 2 (Company Levered Value), the portfolio's return of Company 2 is higher than the portfolio's return of Company 1 as follows:

$$
W _ {2} \equiv W _ {L} <   W _ {1} \equiv W _ {U} \rightarrow Y _ {2} > Y _ {1} \tag {7.28}
$$

In this situation, there are conditions for arbitrage: the investor sells the shares of Company 1 (with subsequent depreciation of  $E_{1}$  and therefore  $W_{1}$ ) and acquires a mixed portfolio containing an appropriate fraction of the shares of Company 2 (with a consequent increase in  $E_{2}$  and therefore  $W_{2}$ ). This movement continues until the value of the two companies is aligned in new conditions of equilibrium that will be equal to:

$$
W _ {2} \equiv W _ {L} = W _ {1} \equiv W _ {U} \tag {7.29}
$$

In this Case 2, the acquisition of a mixed portfolio of stock of a levered company (Company 2) and bonds in the proportions equal to the value of equity to total levered value  $\left( \frac{E_2}{W_2} \right)$  and the value of debt on total levered value  $\left( \frac{D_2}{W_2} \right)$  of the Levered Company (Company 2) respectively, can be regarded as an operation that "undoes" the leverage, providing access to an appropriate fraction of total return of the unlevered company. This possibility of undoing the leverage prevents the value of levered companies from being consistently less than those of unlevered companies; or equivalently, it prevents the average cost of capital  $\left( \frac{X}{W} \right)$  from being systematically higher for a levered company than for an unlevered company in the same class.

Proposition II: the expected yield of a stock share is equal to the appropriate capitalization rate  $(p_k)$  for a pure equity stream in the class, plus a premium related to financial risk equal to the debt-to-equity ratio times the spread between  $p_k$  and  $r$ .

Denoting with  $i_j$  the expected rate of return (or expected yield) on the j-th company's stocks (the after-tax yield on equity capital) belonging to the k-th class;  $p_k$  the expected rate of return of pure equity for the k-th class in which the j-company is included (it is constant for any company in the k-th class and it is one for each k-th class);  $r_D$  the rate return of debt;  $D_j$  the market value of the debt of the j-firm;  $E_j$  the market value of the equity of the j-company, we have:

$$
i _ {j} = p _ {k} + \left(p _ {k} - r _ {D}\right) \frac {D _ {j}}{E _ {j}} \tag {7.30}
$$

The market price of any stock is equal to the capitalization of its expected return at the variable rate  $i_{j}$ . Then, the capital structure does not affect the cost of capital because the return on equity is linear function of the relationship between debt and equity.

Equation (7.30) shows that for all companies in the same k-class, the relation between the return on stock and capital structure, as measured by the ratio  $D_{j} / E_{j}$ , will approximate a straight line with slope equal to  $(p_k - r_D)$  and point of interception equal to  $p_k$ .

It is relevant to note that by definition the expected rate of return of the stock of the j-th company  $(i_j)$  is equal to the ratio by the net profit of the company (equal to the expected return of the assets of the company  $(X_j)$  less the rate return on debt  $(r_D)$  multiplied for the debt amount  $(D_j)$  in the capital structure), and the equity value of the company  $(E_j)$ . It is the yield on equity capital, and it is equal to:

$$
i _ {j} \equiv \frac {X _ {j} - r _ {D} D _ {j}}{E _ {j}} \tag {7.31}
$$

From Eq. (7.3) regards the Proposition I, we have:

$$
\frac {X _ {j}}{W _ {j}} \equiv \frac {X _ {j}}{\left(E _ {j} + D _ {j}\right)} = p _ {k} \rightarrow X _ {j} = p _ {k} \left(E _ {j} + D _ {j}\right)
$$

and substituting:

$$
\begin{array}{l} i _ {j} = \frac {p _ {k} (E _ {j} + D _ {j}) - r _ {D} D _ {j}}{E _ {j}} = \frac {p _ {k} E _ {j} + p _ {k} D _ {j} - r _ {D} D _ {j}}{E _ {j}} = \frac {p _ {k} E _ {j} + D _ {j} (p _ {k} - r _ {D})}{E _ {j}} \\ = \frac {p _ {k} E _ {j}}{E _ {j}} + \frac {D _ {j} \left(p _ {k} - r _ {D}\right)}{E _ {j}} \\ \end{array}
$$

and then:

$$
i _ {j} = p _ {k} + \left(p _ {k} - r\right) \frac {D _ {j}}{E _ {j}}
$$

Representing Proposition II. Note that Proposition II is a direct consequence of Proposition I.

In the same paper (1958), MM introduced corporate taxes. The conclusions they reach in this paper will be reviewed and modified in the subsequent paper (1963).

MM (1958) stated that in conditions of equilibrium, the market value of companies in each class must be proportional to their expected return net of corporate taxes. These expected net returns are equal to the sum of the interest paid and expected net income for stockholders.

By introducing the corporate taxes, the expected net income (total income net of taxes generated by the company) changes.

Denoting with  $\mathrm{X_j^t}$  the expected net income (total income net of taxes generated by the company) of the j-th company;  $X_{j}$  the expected income before taxes;  $t$  the average rate of income corporate tax;  $r_{D}$  the rate return of debt;  $D_{j}$  the market value of the debt of the j-company. The expected net income is equal to:

$$
X _ {j} ^ {t} \equiv (X _ {j} - r _ {D} D _ {j}) (1 - t) + r _ {D} D _ {j} \tag {7.32}
$$

The second part of Eq. (7.32) defines the expected return of bondholders, while the first part defines the expected net income of the stockholders  $(\pi_j^t)$ , as follows:

$$
\pi_ {j} ^ {t} \equiv (X _ {j} - r _ {D} D _ {j}) (1 - t) \tag {7.33}
$$

Therefore, the expected net income of the company is equal to the expected return of both stockholders and bondholders, as follows:

$$
X _ {j} ^ {t} \equiv \pi_ {j} ^ {t} + r _ {D} D _ {j} \tag {7.34}
$$

By using  $X_{j}^{t}$  Propositions I and II can be rewritten.

Proposition I can be modified as follows:

$$
\frac {X _ {j}}{\left(E _ {j} + D _ {j}\right)} \equiv \frac {X _ {j}}{W _ {j}} = p _ {k} \quad b e c o m e s \Rightarrow \frac {\left(X _ {j} - r _ {D} D _ {j}\right) (1 - t) + r _ {D} D _ {j}}{\left(E _ {j} + D _ {j}\right)} \equiv \frac {X _ {j} ^ {t}}{W _ {j}} = p _ {k} ^ {t} \tag {7.35}
$$

where  $p_k^t$  is the expected rate of net return of the k-th class in which is included the j-company. Also in this case it is constant for any companies in the k-class, and one for each k-th class.

Proposition II can be modified as follows:

$$
i _ {j} = \frac {X _ {j} ^ {t} - r _ {D} D _ {j}}{E _ {j}} = \frac {\pi_ {j} ^ {t} + r _ {D} D _ {j} - r _ {D} D _ {j}}{E _ {j}} = \frac {\pi_ {j} ^ {t}}{E _ {j}} \tag {7.36}
$$

and then:

$$
i _ {j} \equiv \frac {X _ {j} - r _ {D} D _ {j}}{E _ {j}} = p _ {k} + \left(p _ {k} - r _ {D}\right) \frac {D _ {j}}{E _ {j}} \text {b e c o m e s} \Rightarrow i _ {j} \equiv \frac {\pi_ {j} ^ {t}}{E _ {j}} = p _ {k} ^ {t} + \left(p _ {k} ^ {t} - r _ {D}\right) \frac {D _ {j}}{E _ {j}} \tag {7.37}
$$

where  $i_j$  is the yield on equity capital, and  $p_k^t$  is the capitalization rate for net income (income net of corporate taxes) for the j-th company in the k-class. This definition is equivalent to the expected rate of net return of the k-th class in which is included the j-company.

Equations (7.35) and (7.37) show that the form and the structure of Propositions I and II are the same.

In their subsequent paper (1963), MM proposed "a correction" by modifying the conclusions which were reached in the original paper (1958). The introduction of corporate taxes modifies Propositions I and II in their structure.

With regards to Proposition I, MM affirmed that the arbitrage makes values within any class a function not only of expected net returns (after tax returns), but also of the tax rate and degree of leverage. It implies that the tax advantages of debt financing are relevant and they generate a quantitative difference between levered and unlevered value of the company.

Therefore, Proposition I can be redefined as follows:

Proposition I with Corporate Taxes: the value of the levered company is equal to sum of the unlevered company plus the value of the tax shields due to the interest on debt deducibility.

The distribution of net income (after tax income) is affected by leverage. To see how, denote by the random variable  $X$  the long-run average EBIT generated by current assets of the j-company within the k-th risk class.

Denoting with  $\bar{X}$  the expected value of  $X$  and with  $Z$  a random variable that has the same value for all companies in the same k-th class, and therefore it is a constant, and it is a drawing from a distribution, say  $f_{k}(Z)$ .

In the same risk-class,  $X$  can be defined in the following form:

$$
X = \bar {X} Z \rightarrow Z = \frac {X}{\bar {X}} \leftrightarrow f _ {k} (Z) \tag {7.38}
$$

Therefore, the random variable of the Net Return  $(X^t)$  (after-tax return), can be expressed as function of EBIT  $(X)$ , the interest bill and therefore the amount of interest on debt  $(R)$ , the marginal corporate income tax rate (assumed equal to the average)  $(t)$  as follows:

$$
X ^ {t} = (X - R) (1 - t) + R = (1 - t) X + t R \tag {7.39}
$$

Substituting  $X$  for its random variable (equal for all companies in the same k-th class), as defined in Eq. (7.38), Eq. (7.39) becomes:

$$
X ^ {t} = (1 - t) \bar {X} Z + t R \tag {7.40}
$$

Considering that the expected Net Return is equal to:

$$
E \left(X ^ {t}\right) \equiv \bar {X} ^ {t} = (1 - t) \bar {X} + t R
$$

and then:

$$
(1 - t) \bar {X} = \bar {X} ^ {t} - t R
$$

$$
X ^ {t} = (\bar {X} ^ {t} - t R) Z + t R
$$

and then Eq. (7.40) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
X ^ {t} = \bar {X} ^ {t} \left(1 - \frac {t R}{\bar {X} ^ {t}}\right) Z + t R \tag {7.41}
$$

Equation (7.41) shows that if the tax rate is different from zero, the shape of the distribution of Net Return  $(X^t)$  not only depends on the scale of the expected Net Income  $(\bar{X}^{t})$  and on distribution  $(Z)$ , but also on the tax rate  $(t)$  and the degree of leverage according to interest on debt as measured by the ratio between the interests paid  $(R)$  and the expected Net Income  $(\bar{X}^{t})$  so that:  $R / \bar{X}^t$ .

From an investors' perspective, the long-run average stream of Net Returns (after-tax returns) is equal to the sum of components:

- an uncertain stream equal to  $(1 - t)\bar{X}Z$ : that is all of the expected net returns;
- a sure stream equal to  $tR$ : that is the extra net return (extra after tax return) due to the tax advantages of debt as function of the deducibility of interest payments on debt. It is usually defined as the tax savings on interest payments.

The first component, defines the unlevered value of the firm  $(W_U)$  as follows:

$$
W _ {U} = \frac {(1 - t) \bar {X}}{p _ {t}} \leftrightarrow p _ {t} = \frac {(1 - t) \bar {X}}{W _ {U}} \tag {7.42}
$$

where  $p_t$  is the rate at which the market capitalizes the expected Net Returns of an unlevered company of size  $\bar{X}$  within k-th class.

# 7.1 Capital Structure Choices

The second component, defines the value of the tax shields due to the tax advantages of debt function of deducibility of interest payments on debt. Assume that the rate of interest is a constant independent of the debt amount so that:

$$
r = \frac {R}{D} \rightarrow D = \frac {R}{r} \rightarrow R = D r \tag {7.43}
$$

In this case, the value the tax savings is equal to:

$$
W _ {T S} = \frac {t R}{r} \leftrightarrow r = \frac {t R}{W _ {T S}} \tag {7.44}
$$

where  $r$  is the rate at which the market capitalizes the sure streams generated by tax savings on interest payments.

Therefore, the value of a levered company of size  $\bar{X}$  with a permanent level of debt  $(D_L)$  in the capital structure, is equal to:

$$
W _ {L} = \frac {(1 - t) \bar {X}}{p _ {t}} + \frac {t R}{r} = W _ {U} + t D _ {L} \tag {7.45}
$$

It is worth noting that  $r < p_t$  because the extra after tax earnings ( $tR$ ) is a sure income while the expected after tax earnings ( $(1 - t)\bar{X}$ ) is uncertain.

Generally, the levered value of the company  $(W_{L})$  is equal to its unlevered value  $(W_{U})$  plus the value of tax savings  $(W_{TS})$  as follows:

$$
W _ {L} = W _ {U} + W _ {T S} \tag {7.46}
$$

Based on redefinition of Proposition I, Proposition II can be redefined.

Proposition II with Corporate Taxes: the cost of equity is positively correlated to the degree of leverage.

Remember that:

$$
(1 - t) \bar {X} = \bar {X} ^ {t} - t R; \quad r = \frac {R}{D} \rightarrow\begin{array}{c}D = \frac {R}{r}\\R = D r\end{array}
$$

And by substituting in Eq. (7.45), we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} W _ {L} = \frac {(1 - t) \bar {X}}{p _ {t}} + \frac {t R}{r} = \frac {\bar {X} ^ {t} - t R}{p _ {t}} + t D = \frac {\bar {X} ^ {t} - t D r}{p _ {t}} + t D = \frac {\bar {X} ^ {t}}{p _ {t}} - \frac {t D r}{p _ {t}} + t D = \frac {\bar {X} ^ {t}}{p _ {t}} + t D \left(1 - \frac {r}{p _ {t}}\right) \\ = \frac {\bar {X} ^ {t}}{p _ {t}} + t D \left(\frac {p _ {t} - r}{p _ {t}}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

And then:

$$
W _ {L} = \frac {\bar {X} ^ {t}}{p _ {t}} + t D \left(\frac {p _ {t} - r}{p _ {t}}\right) \tag {7.47}
$$

Solving Eq. (7.47) for  $(\bar{X}^t /W_L)$ , we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\bar {X} ^ {t}}{p _ {t}} = W _ {L} - t D \left(\frac {p _ {t} - r}{p _ {t}}\right)\rightarrow \bar {X} ^ {t} = W _ {L} p _ {t} - p _ {t} t D \left(\frac {p _ {t} - r}{p _ {t}}\right)\rightarrow \frac {\bar {X} ^ {t}}{W _ {L}} \\ = \frac {W _ {L}}{W _ {L}} p _ {t} - \frac {t D (p _ {t} - r)}{W _ {L}} \\ \frac {\bar {X} ^ {t}}{W _ {L}} = p _ {t} - t \left(p _ {t} - r\right) \frac {D}{W _ {L}} \tag {7.48} \\ \end{array}
$$

Equation (7.47) shows how the after-tax yield is affected by leverage.

Now it is possible to calculate the after-tax yield on equity capital that is equal to the ratio between net profit (profit after taxes) and the value of the shares.

Subtracting  $D$  from both side of Eq. (7.47), we have:

$$
W _ {L} = \frac {\bar {X} ^ {t}}{p _ {t}} + t D \left(\frac {p _ {t} - r}{p _ {t}}\right)\rightarrow W _ {L} - D = \frac {\bar {X} ^ {t}}{p _ {t}} + t D \left(\frac {p _ {t} - r}{p _ {t}}\right) - D
$$

and by explicating  $\bar{X}^t$  into its two components of (i) expected net profit after taxes  $(\pi_t)$  and (ii) the interest payments on debt  $(R = rD)$ , we have:

$$
W _ {L} - D = \frac {\pi_ {t} + r D}{p _ {t}} + t D \left(\frac {p _ {t} - r}{p _ {t}}\right) - D
$$

and solving:

$$
\begin{array}{l} W _ {L} - D = \frac {\pi_ {t}}{p _ {t}} + \frac {r D}{p _ {t}} + t D - \frac {t D r}{p _ {t}} - D; W _ {L} - D = \frac {\pi_ {t}}{p _ {t}} + \frac {r D}{p _ {t}} (1 - t) - D (1 - t); W _ {L} - D \\ = \frac {\pi_ {t}}{p _ {t}} + (1 - t) \left(\frac {r D}{p _ {t}} - D\right); W _ {L} - D = \frac {\pi_ {t}}{p _ {t}} - (1 - t) \left(D - \frac {r D}{p _ {t}}\right); W _ {L} - D \\ = \frac {\pi_ {t}}{p _ {t}} - (1 - t) \left(D \left(1 - \frac {r}{p _ {t}}\right)\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

and then:

$$
W _ {L} - D = \frac {\pi_ {t}}{p _ {t}} - (1 - t) D \left(\frac {p _ {t} - r}{p _ {t}}\right) \tag {7.49}
$$

Considering that the company levered value  $(W_{L})$  less debt  $(D)$  is equal to the company unlevered value  $(W_{U})$ , we have:

$$
W _ {U} = W _ {L} - D \rightarrow W _ {U} = \frac {\pi_ {t}}{p _ {t}} - (1 - t) D \left(\frac {p _ {t} - r}{p _ {t}}\right)
$$

and by solving for  $\pi_t$ , we have:

$$
\pi_ {t} = W _ {U} p _ {t} + p _ {t} (1 - t) D \left(\frac {p _ {t} - r}{p _ {t}}\right)
$$

and dividing both terms by  $W_{U}$ :

$$
\frac {\pi_ {t}}{W _ {U}} = p _ {t} + (1 - t) \left(p _ {t} - r\right) \frac {D}{W _ {U}}
$$

Consider that the after-tax yield on equity capital  $(i_E)$  is equal to the ratio between expected net profit after taxes  $(\pi_t)$  and the value of shares and therefore the unlevered value of the company  $(W_U)$ , the equation can be rewritten as follows:

$$
i _ {E} = p _ {t} + (1 - t) \left(p _ {t} - r\right) \frac {D}{W _ {U}} \tag {7.50}
$$

The equation shows an increase in the after-tax yield on equity capital  $(i_E)$  as leverage increases which is smaller than the original version of Proposition II by a factor of  $(1 - t)$ . But again, the linear increasing relation of this equation is still fundamentally different from the original in which the cost of equity is completely independent from the leverage. In this case the cost of equity capital is dependent from leverage.

It is possible to summarize two Propositions over time as follows (Table 7.1):

At a later stage, Miller (1977) introduced personal taxes in addition to corporate tax.

By introducing personal taxes, the value of tax savings can be rewritten as follows:

Table 7.1 MM propositions

$$
W _ {T S} = D \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(1 - t _ {c}\right) \left(1 - t _ {e}\right)}{\left(1 - t _ {d}\right)} \right] \tag {7.51}
$$

The company levered value  $(W_{L})$  is equal to the company unlevered value  $(W_{U})$  plus the value of tax savings  $(W_{TS})$  as defined by Eq. (7.46). On the basis of specification of Eq. (7.51), Eq. (7.46) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
W _ {L} = W _ {U} + W _ {T S} \rightarrow W _ {L} = W _ {U} + D \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(1 - t _ {c}\right)\left(1 - t _ {e}\right)}{\left(1 - t _ {d}\right)} \right] \tag {7.52}
$$

In order to demonstrate Eq. (7.52) (Ross et al. 1997), assume that company is financed by equity and debt.

Denoting with  $D$  the debt level in the capital structure;  $K_{D}$  the cost of debt;  $t_{c}$  the corporate tax rate (in average);  $t_{e}$  the personal tax rate on equity investor; and by calculating the operating income on the basis of EBIT, the return for stockholders  $(r_{E})$  and the return for bondholders  $(r_{D})$  can be defined respectively as follows:

$$
r _ {E} = \left(E B I T - D K _ {D}\right) \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) \left(1 - t _ {e}\right) \tag {7.52}
$$

$$
r _ {D} = K _ {D} D \left(1 - t _ {d}\right) \tag {7.53}
$$

On the basis of Eqs. (7.52) and (7.53) it is possible to calculate the total return for investors  $(r_I)$ , as follows:

$$
r _ {I} = r _ {E} + r _ {D} = (E B I T - D K _ {D}) \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) \left(1 - t _ {e}\right) + K _ {D} D \left(1 - t _ {d}\right)
$$

and then:

$$
r _ {I} = E B I T \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) \left(1 - t _ {e}\right) + D K _ {D} \left(1 - t _ {d}\right) \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(1 - t _ {c}\right) \left(1 - t _ {e}\right)}{\left(1 - t _ {d}\right)} \right] \tag {7.54}
$$

The first part of Eq. (7.54) is the unlevered value of the company  $(W_U)$ . Indeed, it is equal to the stockholders' return for an unlevered company:

$$
W _ {U} = E B I T \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) \left(1 - t _ {e}\right) \tag {7.55}
$$

Considering the second part of Eq. (7.54), if the investor acquires a bond equal to  $D$ , his return is equal to:  $DK_{D}(1 - t_{d})$ . Therefore, the value of debt is equal to:

$$
D = D K _ {D} \left(1 - t _ {d}\right) \tag {7.56}
$$

On the basis of Eqs. (7.54), (7.55) and (7.56), Eq. (7.54) the levered value of the company  $(W_{L})$  is equal to:

$$
W _ {L} = W _ {L} + D \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(1 - t _ {c}\right) \left(1 - t _ {e}\right)}{\left(1 - t _ {d}\right)} \right]
$$

That is Eq. (7.52).

Note that if the tax rate on equity is the same as the tax rate on debt  $(t_d = t_e)$  or if they are both equal zero  $(t_d = t_e = 0)$ , Eq. (7.52) becomes:

$$
W _ {L} = W _ {L} + D t _ {c} \tag {7.57}
$$

Representing Proposition II with corporate tax and without personal taxes.

If personal taxes are different from zero and the tax rates on equity and debt are different among them, two main cases can be generated:

-  $t_e < t_d$ : personal taxes are higher for a levered company than for an unlevered company. Tax savings are lower than tax savings due to corporate taxes only. Therefore, the lower corporate taxes for the unlevered company are offset by an increase in personal taxes on investors;
-  $t_e > t_d$ : tax savings are higher than tax savings due to corporate taxes only. Therefore, the levered value of the company is increased by savings due to both corporate and personal taxes;
-  $(1 - t_d) = (1 - t_c)(1 - t_e)$ : there are no tax savings. In this case tax savings due to corporate taxes are equal to an increase in personal taxes. Therefore, the value of a levered company is equal to the value of an unlevered company in accordance with Proposition I.

Also if:

-  $(1 - t_d) < (1 - t_c)(1 - t_e)$ : the levered value of the company is lower than its unlevered value:  $W_L < W_U$
-  $(1 - t_d) > (1 - t_c)(1 - t_e)$ : the levered value of the company is higher than its unlevered value:  $W_L > W_U$ .

It is important that Propositions I and II of MM are based on very restrictive assumptions and are not feasible in a real world. Over the years by removing the restrictions the assumptions used by MM have developed many theories and empirical researches (Fan et al. 2012; Rauh and Sufi 2010; Frank and Goyal 2009; De Jong et al. 2008; Brounen et al. 2006; Claessens and Klapper 2005; Bancel and Mittoo 2004; Hall et al. 2004; Berkowitz et al. 2003; La Porta et al. 2002; Beck et al. 2002; Rajan and Zingales 2003, 1998, 1995; Myers 2001, 2003, 1984; Booth et al. 2001; Graham and Harvey 2001; Wurgler 2000; Demirgüç-Kunt and Maksimivic 1998, 1999; Harris and Raviv 1991).

Specifically, the introduction of many variables in the model leads to postulate the relevance of capital structure choices on company value and consequently the existence of the "optimal" capital structure.

Several theories have been developed over time. Among these, there are three main ones (De Luca 2015, 2017a, b): (i) trade-off theory extended with agency theory; (ii) packing order theory; (iii) market time theory.

The trade-off theory (Kraus and Litzenberger 1973) tries to find "optimal" capital structure by assuming that the market is not perfect, considering taxes and costs of financial distress. Therefore the capital structure is a result of the trade-off between debt benefits and costs.

In this sense the higher the taxation on dividends, indicates more debt (Miller and Scholes 1978; Modigliani and Miller 1963); the higher the non-debt tax shields, the lower the debt; higher costs of financial distress indicate more equity. Bankruptcy hypothesis can force managers to forgo profitable investment opportunities (Myers 1977).

Usually another relevant element considered in the definition of debt level based on trade-off between benefits and costs of debt are the agency costs (Morellec 2004; Morellec and Schurhoff 2010).

The agency theory (Jensen 1986; Jensen and Meckling 1976) focuses attention on the debt effects on the relationship between: (i) stockholders and management, and (ii) stockholders and bondholders. Capital structure choices have effects on agency cost of equity and debt. Considering agency costs of equity and debt, the effects of debt on company performance is non-unique. Often agency concerns are included in the trade-off framework so that it is broadly interpreted.

Debt has a positive effect on agency cost of equity. Indeed, it reduces conflicts between stockholders and management due to the difference in their utility functions, with consequent different behaviour, targets, information (managers have more information and better quality than stockholders with the creation of asymmetric information) and operating decisions. While the first want to maximize equity value, the second want to maximize firm value because it increases their control of resources, power and compensation.

Usually conflicts are strong in the presence of relevant free cash flows (Lane et al. 1998; Bergh 1995; Hoskisson et al. 1994; Bethel and Liebeskind 1993; Jensen 1986; Amihud and Lev 1981). Therefore, the managers undertake various forms of action including designing the right controls (Aghion and Bolton 1992), choosing securities to raise financing (Hart and Moore 1995) and therefore determining capital structure (Jensen 1986; Grossman and Hart 1982; Jensen and Meckling 1976).

Debt is a discipline tool for managers (Jensen 1986). It increases the company's default risk according to the cash-out related debt obligations, requiring to maximisation of efficiency, therefore increasing equity value (Lane et al. 1998; Noe and Rebello 1996; Bergh 1995; Hoskisson et al. 1994; Bethel and Liebeskind 1993; Harris and Raviv 1990, 1991; Stulz 1990; Friend and Hasbrouck 1988; Jensen 1986; Amihud and Lev 1981). The positive effects of debt are clearer for manager-owner who have their personal wealth invested in the company because bankruptcy has a greater impact on his interests (Noe and Rebello 1996; Leland and Toft 1996; Firend and Hasbrouck 1988; Amihud and Lev 1981).

The existence and the consistence of agency costs of equity depends mainly on: (i) the culture and characteristics of the managers; (ii) the way in which a manager can exercise his own preferences without considering the value maximization in decision making; (iii) the nature and the costs of monitoring and bonding activities; (iv) the costs of measuring and evaluating the performance of the managers; (v) the costs of devising and applying an index for compensating the manager which correlates with the owner's welfare; (vi) the costs of devising and enforcing specific behavioural rules or policies; (vii) the costs of managers' replacement (Bhagat et al. 2011).

On the contrary, debt has a negative effect on agency costs of debt. It increases conflicts between stakeholders and bondholders according to the different company claims (Jensen 1986). Equity offers holders residual claims on company cash flow while debt offers holders a fixed claim over a borrowing company's cash flow. Therefore, stakeholders' moral hazard and asset-substitutions are possible (Harris and Raviv 1991; Diamond 1989; Jensen and Meckling 1976).

If projects are financed by debt, stockholders have an incentive to the sub-optimal investments. Bondholders are damaged in the presence of high-risk investments because they support the risk. If the project fails, bondholders bear most of the consequence mainly due to the stockholders limited liability; otherwise, if the project is successful, the bondholders will be paid a fixed amount and stockholders capture most of the gains (Harris and Raviv 1991; Jensen and Meckling 1976).

Bondholders do not know what type of projects will be chosen by the company (safe projects, risky projects, average safe-risky projects) with no subsequent alignment between risk and debt interest rate in presence of asset substitutions effects (Harris and Raviv 1991). The company can choose a risky project to maximize equity value after raising funds from bondholders shifting from lower-risk to higher-risk investments without alignment of debt interest rate to major risk (Diamond 1989).

Bondholders try to anticipate the stockholders' opportunistic behaviour by lending less debt or increasing its cost.

Based on these considerations, too much equity can lead to conflicts between managers and stockholders (Jensen 1986). Too much debt can lead to conflicts between stockholders and bondholders (Jensen and Meckling 1976).

The pecking order theory (Baker and Wurgler 2002; Fama and French 1998, 2002; Shyam-Sunder and Myers 1999; Myers 1984; Myers and Majluf 1984) is based on the adverse selection and argues that it does not define an "optimal capital structure" resulting from the balance between benefits and costs of debt and equity. The company structure is based on a source hierarchy. The company initially prefers sources of due to self-finance adapting the dividend policy to the investment opportunities. If external sources are required, the company prefers to resort initially to debt, then hybrid instruments and only finally to equity. Therefore the internal sources of finance (self-finance) are preferred to external ones where debt is preferred to equity.

There are two kinds of equity: internal, regarding self-financing, that is at the top of the packing order; external, regarding the emission of new shares, that is at the bottom of the packing order. Without investment's opportunities the company retains profits and builds up financial slack to avoid having to raise external finance in the future (Zwiebel 1996; Myers and Majluf 1984).

The market time theory (Baker and Wurgler 2002) based on inefficiency of the capital market and asymmetric information suggests that the capital structure choices of the company depend on capital market conditions. The capital structure of the company evolves as the cumulative outcome of the pasts attempts to time the equity market. Managers look at current conditions in both debt and equity markets. Therefore if they need financing they use whichever market currently looks more favourable (Frank and Goyal 2009).

The theory highlights that market timing has large and persistent effects on capital structure of the company. Therefore the company issues shares at higher prices and repurchases at a lower price. In this regard, the company tends to exploit temporary fluctuations in the cost of equity related to the cost of other capital forms. Therefore first company tends to issue equity (instead of debt) when market value is high (relative to book value and past market values) and repurchase equity when market value is low. Second, the company issues equity when the cost of equity is relatively low and repurchase equity when the cost is relatively high. Third, the company tends to issue equity at times when investors are too enthusiastic about earnings perspectives. Fourth, managers consider the market timing is very relevant in the capital structure choices (see the survey of Graham and Harvey 2001). Therefore low leverage companies are the ones that raised funds when their market valuations were high, as measured by the market-to-book ratio, while high leverage companies are the ones that raised funds when their market valuations were low.

The theory states that the existing capital structure of the company is a cumulative result of the company's past experience, which it has attempted time to time under equity market. The theory states that there is no optimal capital structure where capital structure is an outcome of various decisions, which have been made over time. Therefore the market time theory, as well as packing order theory, is structured more on the manager reactions to the environment rather than to a trade-off of specific determinants.

Several researches find proof of market timing in different forms and degrees (see Ritter 2003 for a detailed list of papers that provide evidence of market timing. Among others: Hovakimian 2006; Pagano et al. 1998; Taggart 1977; Jung et al. 1996; Loughran and Ritter 1995; Ikenberry et al. 1995; Korajczyk et al. 1991; Marsh 1982).

There are two versions of equity market timing that lead to similar capital structure dynamics (Baker and Wurgler 2002).

The first, based on the rational managers and investors and adverse selection costs. The company tends to announce equity issue following the release of information which may reduce information asymmetry. Equity issues cluster around periods of somewhat smaller announcement effects (Korajczyk et al. 1991,

1992, 2003; Baker and Wurgler 2002; Bayless and Chaplinsky 1996; Choe et al. 1993; Lucas and McDonald 1990; Myers and Majluf 1984).

The second, based on irrational investors and managers and time-varying mispricing or perceptions of mispricing. Therefore managers issue equity when they believe its cost is irrationally low and repurchase equity when they believe its cost is irrationally high. Market-to-book is well known to be inversely related to future equity returns, and extreme values of market-to-book have been connected to extreme investor expectations (Frankel and Lee 1998; La Porta et al. 1997; Shleifer and Vishny 1997).

Empirical researches have highlighted many determinants, in addition to the models, that could affect the capital structure choices (Frank and Goyal 2003, 2009; Rajan and Zingales 1995; Harris and Raviv 1991; Titman and Wessels 1988; De Luca 2015; La Porta 1996; La Porta et al. 1998, 1999; Noe 1988; Graham 1999, 2000). Generally, the empirical studies show, with different degrees and little difference, that leverage increases with fixed assets, tax shields, growth opportunities and company size; otherwise, leverage decreases with volatility, advertising expenditures, research and development expenditures, bankruptcy probability, and uniqueness of the product. There is no clear relationship between company performance and leverage.

Empirical studies show that the difficulties associated with determinants are not only due to a correct identification but also to their positive or negative effects on the choices of capital structure. It is also due to the specific characteristics of the company (Myers 2003). It is not unusual that a single determinant has a positive impact on the capital structure choices in some studies while negative in other.

It seems to say that theories and empirical researches are able to explain some aspects under certain conditions of company behaviour. However, there is still no theory can fully explain company behaviour on capital structure or, even more, able to define the optimal capital structure.

In this context the main problem of the capital structure can be defined in terms of capital cost. Specifically, the main problem is to estimate the cost of capital.

Considering that capital structure is defined by equity and debt, it is necessary to estimate the cost of equity and the cost of debt. In both cases, they measure the expected return of investors in equity and debt related to risk bearing. Specifically, the expected return for investors in equity is the cost of equity for the company, and the expected return for investors in debt is the cost of debt for the company (Damodaran 2012).

In general terms, risk-return models in finance are built around the rate that investors can require for risk-free and risky investments. Indeed, most risk-return models start off with an asset defined as risk-free and use its expected return to define the risk-free rate. Then, a risk-premium function of the investments risk is added to the risk-free rate.

Denoting with  $R_f$  the risk-free rate and  $RP$  the risk premium, the  $R_I$  the investment expected return is equal to:

$$
R _ {I} = R _ {f} + R P \tag {7.58}
$$

There are three main considerations about Eq. (7.58):

- The first: in a model of equilibrium such as the CAPM only the market risk is considered and it is captured in the market portfolio. The premium risk is the premium that investors can require when they invest in this portfolio. Also, in the multifactor models only market risk is considered. However, in this case there are multiple risk premiums, each one measuring the premium required by investors to bear a specific market risk factor;
- The second: there is no investment that can be defined as risk-free by definition. The asset free-risk is characterized by a risk level so low as to be approximated to zero. In this context the expected returns can be assumed as certain returns. The securities that have a chance of being risk-free are government bonds. Note that it is not because they cannot fail, but because the government controls the printing of currency, unlike the largest and safest private entity;
- The third: the higher the risk, the higher the premium to the risk. Therefore, riskier investments have a higher expected return than risk-free and the equity risk premium is higher than the risk-free rate  $(RP > R_f)$  by definition.

Equation (7.58) can be declined for investors in debt and investor in equity. Specifically, the expected return by bondholders  $(R_{D})$  is equal to the risk-free rate  $(R_{f})$  plus a spread able to measure the default risk of the firm  $(D_{F})$  as follows:

$$
R _ {D} = R _ {f} + D _ {F} \tag {7.59}
$$

Differently, the expected return by stockholders  $(R_{E})$  is equal to the risk-free rate  $(R_{f})$  plus an equity risk premium for the investment in equity (ERP) as follows:

$$
R _ {E} = R _ {f} + E R P \tag {7.60}
$$

The expected return for investors in equity  $(R_{E})$  is the cost of equity  $(K_{E})$  for the company, as well as, the expected return for investors in debt  $(R_{D})$  is the cost of debt  $(K_{D})$  for the company (Damodaran 2012).

Indeed, the expected return for investors in both equity and debt reflects risk bearing. Consequently, it is the cost of capital in equity and debt for the company.

In terms of cost of capital, Eqs. (7.59) and (7.60) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
R _ {D} \equiv K _ {D}: R _ {D} = R _ {f} + D _ {F} \leftrightarrow K _ {D} = R _ {f} + D _ {F} \tag {7.61}
$$

$$
R _ {E} \equiv K _ {E} \colon R _ {E} = R _ {f} + E R P \leftrightarrow K _ {E} = R _ {f} + E R P \tag {7.62}
$$

# 7.2 Cost of Equity

There are several competitive models to estimate the equity risk premium. Among these, the most well-known is the equilibrium model of Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Arbitrage Pricing Model (APM), Multifactor Model, Proxy Model. Also if the models are different among them, they share some common views on risk (Damodaran 2012):

- risk is defined in terms of variance in actual returns around the expected return. Consequently, the higher the variance of the expected return, the higher the volatility of the asset and the higher the risk. In this sense, the investment is riskless when actual returns are always equal to the expected return and when the variance of expected return is null;
- risk has to be measured from the perspective of the marginal investor in an asset, and then in the perspective of a diversified investor. Therefore, only the risk that an investment adds to a diversified portfolio should be measured and compensated. In this sense, only the systematic-risk is considered because it is not diversifiable, while the company specific risk is not considered because it is diversifiable.

In this context, the cost of equity is derived by CAPM on the basis of SML. The expected return of the investment in equity in the j-th company  $\left(R_{E_j}\right)$ , and therefore the cost of equity for the j-th company  $\left(K_{E_j}\right)$ , is equal to the risk-free rate  $R_f$  plus the equity risk premium equal to coefficient beta of the j-th company  $\left(\beta_j\right)$  multiplied by the difference between expected return on equity market as measured by the market portfolio  $\left(R_m\right)$  and the return (certain) on risk-free investments as measured by the risk-free rate  $\left(R_f\right)$ , as follows:

$$
R _ {E _ {j}} \equiv K _ {E _ {j}}: \quad R _ {E _ {j}} = R _ {f} + \beta_ {j} \left(R _ {m} - R _ {f}\right) \leftrightarrow K _ {E _ {j}} = R _ {f} + \beta_ {j} \left(R _ {m} - R _ {f}\right) \tag {7.63}
$$

The coefficient beta is equal to the covariance between the expected return of the j-th company  $(R_{j})$  and the expected return of market portfolio  $(R_{m})$ , and the variance of the expected return of the market portfolio  $(R_{m})$ , as follows:

$$
\beta_ {j} = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {j} ; R _ {m}\right)}{\operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {m}\right)} = \frac {\sigma_ {\left(R _ {j} ; R _ {m}\right)}}{\sigma_ {\left(R _ {m}\right)} ^ {2}} \tag {7.64}
$$

On the basis of Eq. (7.64), Eq. (7.63) in terms of cost of equity  $(K_{E})$  can be rewritten as follows:

$$
K _ {E _ {j}} = R _ {f} + \frac {\sigma_ {\left(R _ {j} ; R _ {m}\right)}}{\sigma_ {\left(R _ {m}\right)} ^ {2}} \left(R _ {m} - R _ {f}\right) \tag {7.65}
$$

It is relevant to note that Eq. (7.63) is not the CAPM but its derivation. Indeed, in CAPM the risk premium measures what investors, on average, demand as extra return for investing in the market portfolio only with respect to the risk-free asset.

In Eq. (7.63) the key role is played by coefficient beta. It has a central role in the risk-return models because it measures the asset's market risk based on the market portfolio in the CAPM, as well as, based on specific factors in the Arbitrage Pricing Model and Multifactor Models (among others: Alexander and Benston 1982; Alexander and Chervany 1980; Beaver et al. 1970; Blume 1975; Fama and French 1993; Elton et al. 1978; Gonedes 1973; Handa et al. 1989; Hill and Stone 1980; Klemkosky and Martin 1975; Levy 1971, 1974; Logue and Merville 1972; Roenfeldt et al. 1978; Rosenberg and Guy 1976a, b; Rosenberg and McKibben 1973; Scholes and Williams 1977; Scott and Brown 1980; Theobald 1981; Young et al. 1991; Elton and Gruber 1974; La Porta 1996).

There are two main baseline approaches to estimate the coefficient beta. The first is based on an estimate of future betas on the basis of an estimate of correlations between the asset's expected returns and the index's expected returns. In this case, the beta estimate tends to be subjected to the previsions of the analyst about expected returns. The second is based on an estimate of future betas on the basis of historical betas. This approach is more useful and there is proof that historical betas provide useful information on future betas (Blume 1970, 1975; Levy 1971). This approach is usually preferred by analysts to the first one.

In order to estimate the coefficient beta in a corporate assessment, there are two main approaches that are normally used: (i) Regression Beta; (ii) Bottom-Up Beta.

# Regression Beta

The Regression Beta estimates the coefficient beta based on the regression of returns on the investment against returns on a market. This approach is one of the most commonly used by analysts (Damodaran 2012). Obviously, it can be used only if the assets have been traded and have market prices.

In theory, stock returns on assets should be related to returns on a market portfolio that includes all traded assets. In practice, a stock index is used as a proxy for the market portfolio and the beta is estimated for stocks against the stock index.

Specifically, by considering time  $(t)$ , the expected return of j-th company can be estimated on the basis of regression equation as follows:

$$
R _ {j t} = \alpha_ {j} + \beta_ {j} R _ {m t} + e _ {j} \tag {7.66}
$$

And by applying the Ordinary Least Square (OLS), we have:

$$
\beta_ {j} = \frac {\sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \left[ \left(R _ {j t} - \mu_ {j t}\right) \left(R _ {m t} - \mu_ {m t}\right) \right]}{\sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \left(R _ {j t} - \mu_ {j t}\right) ^ {2}} = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {j} ; R _ {m}\right)}{\operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {m}\right)} = \frac {\sigma \left(R _ {j} ; R _ {m}\right)}{\sigma_ {R _ {m}} ^ {2}} \tag {7.67}
$$

and

$$
\alpha_ {j} = R _ {j t} - \beta_ {j} R _ {m t} \tag {7.68}
$$

The value of  $\beta_{i}$  and  $\alpha_{i}$  obtained by using the regression analysis, is used to estimate the true  $\beta_{i}$  and  $\alpha_{i}$  that exist for an asset. Obviously, the estimates are subject to error and therefore, the estimated  $\beta_{i}$  and  $\alpha_{i}$  could not be equal to their real values that existed in the period. Furthermore,  $\beta_{i}$  and  $\alpha_{i}$  are not perfectly stationary over time.

Equation (7.67) shows how the coefficient beta is equal to the covariance between the expected return of the j-th company  $\left(R_{j}\right)$  and the expected return of market portfolio  $(R_{m})$ , and the variance of the expected return of the market portfolio  $(R_{m})$ .

The intercept  $\left(\alpha_{j}\right)$  as defined in Eq. (7.68) provides simple measures of performance of the investment in the j-th company during the period of regression when returns on investment in the j-firm are measured against the expected returns on the basis of the CAPM (Damodaran 2012).

Note that Eq. (7.65) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
K _ {E _ {j}} = R _ {f} \left(1 - \beta_ {j}\right) + \beta_ {j} R _ {m} \leftrightarrow K _ {E _ {j}} = R _ {f} \left(1 - \frac {\sigma_ {\left(R _ {j} ; R _ {m}\right)}}{\sigma_ {\left(R _ {m}\right)} ^ {2}}\right) + \frac {\sigma_ {\left(R _ {j} ; R _ {m}\right)}}{\sigma_ {\left(R _ {m}\right)} ^ {2}} R _ {m} \tag {7.69}
$$

The difference between the intercept  $a_{j}$  from the regression and  $R_{f}(1 - \beta)$  is known as Jensen's Alpha (A) (Damodaran 2012):

$$
A = a _ {j} - R _ {f} \left(1 - \beta_ {j}\right) \tag {7.70}
$$

It measures the stock performance of the j-th company compared with companies with similar beta during the regression period. So that, if (Damodaran 2012):

-  $a_{j} > R_{f}\big(1 - \beta_{j}\big)$ : stock did better than expected during regression period. The j-company has earned more than companies with a similar beta during the regression period;
-  $a_{j} = R_{f}\big(1 - \beta_{j}\big)$ : stock did as well as expected during regression period. The j-company has earned equal the same as companies with a similar beta during the regression period;
-  $a_{j} < R_{f}\big(1 - \beta_{j}\big)$ : stock did worse than expected during regression period. The j-company has earned lower than companies with a similar beta during the regression period.

Note that one of the most important problems to estimate beta by regression model concerns the length of the estimation period. Indeed, there is a normal trade-off: a longer estimation period provides more data, but the company may have changed in its risk characteristics over time.

Consequently, there could be positive or negative sampling errors. Therefore, the beta will be partially a function of the true underlying beta and, partially, a function of the sampling error. Generally, on the long term, the beta tends to converge, on average, to 1. Therefore, in the forecast period the beta tends to be closer to 1 than the estimate obtained from historical data (Blume 1975; Levy 1974). On the basis of this observation, it is possible to modify the past betas to capture the tendency. There are two main techniques used: (i) Blume's technique; (ii) Vasicek's Technique.

Blume's technique (Blume 1975) corrects the past betas by measuring this adjustment directly towards 1. This technique arising from the empirical evidence suggests that the betas for most companies tend to move towards the average beta over time, which is 1.

It assumes that the adjustment in one period is a good estimate of the adjustment in the next. Specifically, in the second period  $(t = 2)$  the beta of i-th asset  $\left(\beta_{i,2}\right)$  can be estimated on the basis of the beta in the first period  $\left(\beta_{i,1}\right)$  adjusted as follows:

$$
\beta_ {i, 2} = 0. 3 4 3 + 0. 6 7 7 \beta_ {i, 1} \tag {7.71}
$$

Note that Eq (7.71) lowers the high value of beta and raises the low value of beta. The process pushes all estimated betas towards 1.

Therefore, if the average beta increased over these two periods, it assumes that average betas will increase over the next period. Obviously, if there are no expectations about this trend, and then if there are not expectations to assume the next average beta of the period will be more than this period's, this change in beta definitely represents an undesirable property.

This technique is one of the most commonly used by analysts. Specifically, the Adjusted Beta  $(\beta_{A})$  (that measures the expected beta) is equal to the Raw Beta  $(\beta_{RB})$  (that is the historical beta) considered for  $2/3(0.67)$  plus the Beta of Market Portfolio  $(\beta_{M})$  (that is equal 1 by definition) considered for  $1/3(0.33)$ , as follows (Damodaran 2012):

$$
\beta_ {A} = \beta_ {R B} (0. 6 7) + \beta_ {M} (0. 3 3) = \beta_ {R B} (0. 6 7) + 1. 0 0 (0. 3 3) \tag {7.72}
$$

Vesicek's technique (Vesicek 1973) assumes that the adjustment depends on the size of the uncertainty about beta. Consequently, the larger the sampling error, the greater the change in large differences from the average being due to sampling error the greater the adjustment.

Specifically, it assumes that the adjusted beta can be modified based on two main considerations: (i) many sectors are characterized by structurally lower or higher betas than the market. Therefore, the average beta of the sector should be considered rather than the market; (ii) the correction of historical beta in order to obtain the expected beta should be proportional to the relevance of the standard error of the beta.

Denoting with  $\beta_{1}$  the average beta across the sample in the historical period;  $\sigma_{\beta_1}^2$  the variance of the distribution of the historical beta over the sample (it measures the variation of beta across the sample of assets under consideration);  $\sigma_{\beta_{j1}}^{2}$  is the square of the standard error of the estimate of beta for the j-th asset measured in the period 1 (it measures the uncertainty associated with the measurement of the individual assets beta). In the second period  $(t = 2)$  the j-th beta  $\left(\beta_{j,2}\right)$  can be estimated as follows:

$$
\beta_ {j, 2} = \frac {\sigma_ {\beta_ {j , 1}} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {\beta_ {1}} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {\beta_ {j , 1}} ^ {2}} \beta_ {1} + \frac {\sigma_ {\beta_ {1}} ^ {2}}{\sigma_ {\beta_ {1}} ^ {2} + \sigma_ {\beta_ {j , 1}} ^ {2}} \beta_ {j, 1} \tag {7.73}
$$

Equation (7.71) can be simplified by analysts in its application. Denoting with  $\beta_{S}$  the beta of the sector,  $\sigma_{\beta_S}^2$  the variance of the beta of the sector,  $\beta_{MS}$  the average beta of the sector,  $\sigma_{\beta_{MS}}^2$  the variance of the average beta of the sector,  $SE^2$  the square of the standard error of the historical beta,  $\beta_{RB}$  the Raw Beta that is the historical beta, the Adjusted Beta  $(\beta_{A})$  that measures the expected beta is equal to:

$$
\beta_ {A} = \beta_ {R B} \frac {\sigma_ {\beta_ {S}} ^ {2}}{\frac {\left(\sigma_ {\beta_ {S}} ^ {2} + S E ^ {2}\right) + \left(\sigma_ {\beta_ {M S}} ^ {2} + S E ^ {2}\right)}{\left(\sigma_ {\beta_ {S}} ^ {2}\right) + S E ^ {2}}} \tag {7.74}
$$

Equation (7.74) shows that the higher the standard error of the historical beta, the higher the adjustment of the beta of the company in the estimate process.

Note that the weighted procedure adjusts observations with large standard errors further towards the mean rather than observations with small standard errors. Indeed, this technique suffers from the potential source of bias of Blume's techniques although it does not forecast a trend in betas.

Based on the considerations of these two techniques, it is relevant to note that by using different periods, market index, and procedures to adjust the regression beta, often the analysis provides different beta for the same company at the same point in time. All beta estimates have a standard error. The main relevant point is that all of the betas reported for a company fall within the range of standard errors from the regressions.

# Bottom-Up Beta

The Bottom-Up Beta estimates the beta by looking at the fundamentals of the business and the characteristics of the company with regards to its financial and operating leverage. Specifically, three are the main determinants of the beta (Damodaran 2012):

(a) business of the company: beta is affected by the business characteristics of the company. It measures the level of risk of the business of the company regarding the market. In this regard, the higher the company's business sensitivity to market conditions, the higher the beta. Consequently, the company involves in sectors of economy that are very sensitive to economic conditions, have a high beta. Other variables being equal, cyclical companies can be expected to have higher betas than non-cyclical companies;
(b) degree of operating leverage of the firm: beta is affected by the degree of operating leverage of the company. The operating leverage is a function of the cost structure of the company as it defines on the basis of relationship between fixed costs and variables costs: the higher the fixed costs related to total costs, the higher the operating leverage of the company. The relationship between beta and operating leverage is due to its effects on operating and net income: the higher the operating leverage, the greater the fixed costs, the higher the volatility of operating income due to the volatility of revenues and, other things remaining equal, the higher the variability of net income.
(c) degree of financial leverage of the company: beta is affected by the degree of financial leverage of the company. Financial leverage is a function of the capital structure of the company as it defines, in terms of relationship between debt and equity: the higher the debt in capital structure, the higher the financial leverage of the company.

The Bottom-Up Beta approach is based on the relationship between beta of levered companies and beta of unlevered companies (Hamada 1972). The equity beta of levered companies  $(\beta_{L})$  is equal to the weighted average of the equity beta of unlevered companies  $(\beta_{U})$  and the beta of debt  $(\beta_{D})$ ; the weights are functions of the debt and equity in the capital structure (Brealey et al. 2016). Assuming no corporate taxes, the relationship can be defined as follows:

$$
\beta_ {L} = \beta_ {U} \left(\frac {E}{E + D}\right) + \beta_ {D} \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) \tag {7.75}
$$

and solving for  $\beta_U$ , we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \beta_ {U} = \left[ \beta_ {L} - \beta_ {D} \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) \right] \left(\frac {E + D}{E}\right) = \beta_ {L} \left(\frac {E + D}{E}\right) - \beta_ {D} \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) \left(\frac {E + D}{E}\right) \\ = \beta_ {E L} \left(\frac {E}{E}\right) + \beta_ {E L} \left(\frac {D}{E}\right) - \beta_ {D} \left(\frac {D}{E}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

and then:

$$
\beta_ {E U} = \beta_ {E L} + \left(\beta_ {E L} - \beta_ {D}\right) \frac {D}{E} \tag {7.76}
$$

Note that Eq. (7.76) is the Proposition II of MM on betas. The relationship between levered and unlevered beta can be defined by combining the Proposition of MM and MM's Proposition and the CAPM (Hamada 1972). Specifically, assume that (Hamada 1972): (i) the MM formulation the tax shield value for constant debt over time; (ii) the debt risk level is very low and then the beta of debt is assumed equal to zero; (iii) the interest on debt are tax deductions by generating tax savings; (iv) the discount rate used to estimate the value of tax shield is assumed equal to the cost of debt. It implies that the value of the tax shield is proportionate to the market value of debt:  $W_{TS} = Dt_{c}$ .

Denote with  $E_U$  the equity of unlevered company;  $E_L$  the equity of the levered company;  $EBIT$  the Earnings before tax and interest;  $t_c$  the corporate tax rate;  $I$  the interest payments on debt;  $\Delta IC$  the changes in capital invested in the business.

The expected return on equity for an unlevered company  $(R_{E_U})$  is equal to:

$$
R _ {E _ {U}} = \frac {E B I T \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) - \Delta I C}{E _ {U}} \tag {7.77}
$$

and the expected return on equity for a levered company  $(R_{E_L})$  is equal to:

$$
R _ {E _ {L}} = \frac {E B I T \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) - I - \Delta I C}{E _ {L}} \tag {7.78}
$$

Substituting Eqs. (7.77) and (7.78) in the equation of j-th company beta  $\left(\beta_{j}\right)$ , and assuming that the covariance between return on market  $(R_{M})$ , the components of capital invested in the company and interests on debt are zero  $(\beta_{\Delta IC} = \beta_{I} = 0)$ , we have:

$$
\beta_ {j} = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(R _ {j} ; R _ {M}\right)}{\operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {M}\right)} \rightarrow\begin{array}{l}\beta_ {U} = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(\frac {\operatorname {E B I T} \left(1 - t _ {c}\right)}{E _ {U}} ; R _ {M}\right)}{\operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {M}\right)}\\\beta_ {L} = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(\frac {\operatorname {E B I T} \left(1 - t _ {c}\right)}{E _ {L}} ; R _ {M}\right)}{\operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {M}\right)}\end{array}\tag {7.79}
$$

The equity, both levered and unlevered, does not have a covariance with market portfolio. Therefore:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \beta_ {U} = \frac {\frac {1}{E _ {U}} \operatorname {C o v} (E B I T \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) ; R _ {M})}{\operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {M}\right)} = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} (E B I T \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) ; R _ {M})}{E _ {U} \operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {M}\right)} \rightarrow \beta_ {U} E _ {U} \\ = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(E B I T \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) ; R _ {M}\right)}{\operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {M}\right)} \\ \end{array}
$$

as well as:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \beta_ {L} = \frac {\frac {1}{E _ {L}} \operatorname {C o v} (E B I T \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) ; R _ {M})}{\operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {M}\right)} = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} (E B I T \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) ; R _ {M})}{E _ {L} \operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {M}\right)} \rightarrow \beta_ {L} E _ {L} \\ = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} \left(\operatorname {E B I T} \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) ; R _ {M}\right)}{\operatorname {V a r} \left(R _ {M}\right)} \\ \end{array}
$$

Therefore, we have:

$$
\beta_ {U} E _ {U} = \beta_ {L} E _ {L} = \frac {\operatorname {C o v} (\operatorname {E B I T} (1 - t _ {c}) ; R _ {M})}{\operatorname {V a r} (R _ {M})}
$$

Consequently:

$$
\beta_ {L} = \beta_ {U} \frac {E _ {U}}{E _ {L}} \tag {7.80}
$$

Assuming no corporate taxes. In this case if the company is financed by equity only its unlevered value  $(W_U)$  is equal to the value of unlevered equity  $(E_U)$  as follows:

$$
W _ {U} = E _ {U} \tag {7.81}
$$

Otherwise, if the company is financed by equity and debt its levered value  $(W_{L})$  is equal to the value of equity levered  $(E_{L})$  plus the value of debt  $(D)$ , as follows:

$$
W _ {L} = E _ {L} + D \tag {7.82}
$$

On the basis of no corporate taxes, the Proposition I of MM shows as the value of unlevered company  $(W_U)$  is equal to the value of levered firm  $(W_L)$ . On the basis of Eq. (7.29) we have:

$$
W _ {U} = W _ {L}
$$

Consequently on the basis of Eqs. (7.81) and (7.82), we have:

$$
E _ {U} = E _ {L} + D \tag {7.83}
$$

On the basis of Eq. (7.83), Eq. (7.80) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\beta_ {L} = \beta_ {U} \frac {E _ {U}}{E _ {L}} \rightarrow \beta_ {L} = \beta_ {U} \left(\frac {E _ {L} + D}{E _ {L}}\right) = \beta_ {U} \left(\frac {E _ {L}}{E _ {L}} + \frac {D}{E _ {L}}\right) = \beta_ {U} \left(1 + \frac {D}{E _ {L}}\right)
$$

and then:

# 7.2 Cost of Equity

$$
\beta_ {L} = \beta_ {U} \left(1 + \frac {D}{E}\right) \tag {7.84}
$$

and inverse:

$$
\beta_ {U} = \frac {\beta_ {L}}{\left(1 + \frac {D}{E}\right)} \tag {7.85}
$$

Assume corporate taxes. The relation between levered and unlevered beta must be changed because the Proposition I of MM is not applicable. In this case, the value of the levered company  $(W_{L})$  is greater than the value of an unlevered company  $(W_{U})$ . The difference is related to the value of tax shield  $(W_{TS})$ . On the basis of Eq. (7.46) we have:

$$
W _ {L} = W _ {U} + W _ {T S}
$$

Assume that the expected tax savings are in perpetuity and assume they are discounted to the cost of debt  $(K_{D})$ . The value of tax shield  $(W_{TS})$  is equal to:

$$
W _ {T S} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {D t _ {c} K _ {D}}{\left(1 + K _ {D}\right) ^ {t}} = \frac {D t _ {c} K _ {D}}{K _ {D}} = D t _ {c} \tag {7.86}
$$

By considering Eqs. (7.46), (7.81), (7.82) and (7.86), Eq. (7.46) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
W _ {L} = W _ {U} + W _ {T S}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}W _ {U} = E _ {U}\\W _ {T S} = D t _ {c}\end{array}\qquad \rightarrow E _ {L} + D = E _ {U} + D t _ {c}
$$

$$
W _ {L} = E _ {L} + D
$$

and by solving by  $E_U$ , we have:

$$
E _ {U} = E _ {L} + D \left(1 - t _ {c}\right)
$$

By substituting the unlevered equity  $(E_U)$  in Eq. (7.80), we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \beta_ {L} = \beta_ {U} \frac {E _ {U}}{E _ {L}} \rightarrow \beta_ {U} \left[ \frac {E _ {L} + D (1 - t _ {c})}{E _ {L}} \right] = \beta_ {U} \left[ \frac {E _ {L}}{E _ {L}} + \frac {D (1 - t _ {c})}{E _ {L}} \right] \\ = \beta_ {U} \left[ 1 + \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) \frac {D}{E _ {L}} \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

and then:

$$
\beta_ {L} = \beta_ {U} \left[ 1 + \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) \left(\frac {D}{E}\right) \right] \tag {7.87}
$$

and inverse:

$$
\beta_ {U} = \frac {\beta_ {L}}{\left[ 1 + \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) \left(\frac {D}{E}\right) \right]} \tag {7.88}
$$

that is the Hamada's equation.

Note that by considering debt risk, it is necessary to introduce the beta of debt  $(\beta_{D})$ . In this case Eq. (7.87) can be rewritten as follows (Damodaran 2012):

$$
\beta_ {L} = \beta_ {U} \left[ 1 + \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) \frac {D}{E} \right] - \beta_ {D} \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) \left(\frac {D}{E}\right) \tag {7.89}
$$

Equations (7.84) and (7.87) show how the unlevered beta measures the risk of unlevered company and therefore the risk function of the company of its business only. Otherwise, the levered beta is a function of the capital structure choices and therefore the financial risk of leverage. Consequently, other variables being equal, an increase in financial leverage increases the levered beta while the unlevered beta does not change. This effect of debt on beta tends to explain why companies operating in the same business, with the same business risk, can have different levered beta as a result of the different capital structure (Berk and DeMarzo 2008). The bottom-up beta, is different from the regression betas and it is based on the company and business fundamentals (Damodaran 2012).

# 7.3 Cost of Debt

The expected return for bondholders  $(R_{D})$  is equal to the risk-free rate  $(R_{f})$  plus a premium for default risk of the company  $(D_{F})$  that is function of the probability of the company's incapacity to face debt obligation. On the basis of Eq. (7.59) we have:

$$
R _ {D} = R _ {f} + D _ {F}
$$

As defined, the expected return of investors in debt  $(R_{D})$  is the cost of debt  $(K_{D})$ . Therefore, on the basis of Eq. (7.61) we have:

$$
R _ {D} \equiv K _ {D} \colon R _ {D} = R _ {f} + D _ {F} \leftrightarrow K _ {D} = R _ {f} + D _ {F}
$$

This chapter analyses the default risk of the company while Chap. 10 analyses the risk-free rate.

With regards to the default risk, it is important to note that unlike investment in equity where the risk relates to the likelihood that cash flows on investments can be different from the expected cash flow, in the investment in debt, the cash flows are promised when the investment is made. Therefore, in this case the risk is not function of the variance of expected return but it is due to the company's default probability only.

While the risk-return models for equity are based on the effects of the market risk only by assuming a diversified investor (marginal investor), differently models of default risk are based on the effects of company-specific default risk on promised return for investors in debt.

Therefore, while thanks to the diversification process the specific risk of the company is not priced into expected return for equity, the same rationale cannot be applied to bonds because they have limited upside potential and a greater downside potential arising from company-specific conditions. By investing in debt, the interests are fixed at the time of investment, and they represent the promised cash flow on debt. The worst-scenario for bondholders, is that he does not receive, with a different degree, the payment of interest and the reimbursement of capital.

There is a positive proportional relationship between cost of debt and default risk of the company: higher the company's default risk, the higher the return on debt required by investors, and then the higher the cost of debt for the company.

Generally, the company's default risk is function of three main variables:

- the company's ability to generate cash flows from operations;
- the volatility of cash flows from operations;
- the financial obligations with regards to interest payments and principal reimbursement.

Therefore, the higher the company's ability to generate cash flows from operations able to face debt obligations, the lower the company's default risk. Then, companies that generate high operating cash flows related to their financial obligations should have lower default risk than companies that generate low operating cash flows related to obligations.

Also, with equal conditions of operating cash flows they are able to cover the obligations on debt, the lower the operating cash flows volatility, higher their stability, and therefore the lower the default risk.

An estimate of the company's default risk is the main problem to solve. There are two main approaches to be followed:

- Agency rating approach: it is the most widely used. It is based on the bond rating assigned by a specialized Agency Rating to company bonds.

The market price of the bonds, together with their coupons and maturities, allows for capturing of their yields (or more usually, their yields to maturity) that are used as the cost of debt of the company.

The rating assigned to company bonds by a specialized Agency Rating is mainly based on the financial ratios of the company with the objective of assessing the company's ability to face debt obligations.

The most important problem is that this approach requires that outstanding bonds are widely liquid, trade frequent and have a rating as issued by a specialized rating agency.

- Synthetic rating approach: it measures the default risk of the company based on the analysis of its fundamentals. Many companies are not rated, by choice or because they are smaller. Generally, when there is no rating available to estimate the cost of debt, synthetic rating can be estimated. In this case the analyst plays a role of the rating agency by assigning a rating to a company based on the analysis of its fundamentals.

There are two main types of study in literature about the default risk of the company also if they are strictly related: (i) studies on structural-form model and reduced-form model and (ii) studies on accounting models (De Luca 2017a, b).

The structural-form models and the reduced-form models modelling the credit risk. These two classes of studies are characterized by their own advantages and disadvantages. Generally, while the reduced-form models have a lot of room for calibrating of historical data but they lack the financial elements for the mode parameters, the structural models are intuitive and they have a nice explanation in financial terms but they lack measuring in particular the short-term credit risk and they are much harder to apply whenever there is more than one debt instrument (Gupta 2013). Specifically, while the structural models have the advantage to explicitly model a company's assets by assuming that the company's assets follow a geometric Brownian motion, reduced models do not formally link a company's assets to the corporate credit issued by it. They are based on exogenously specified parameters, such as recovery rates to value corporate credit (Rajaratnam et al. 2017).

Structural-form models originate from the study of Merton (1974), Black and Scholes (1973). In general terms, with Merton's work that postulates company value follows a diffusion process with constant volatility as described by the Geometric Brownian Motion, the volatility of share prices and debt values exhibit plays a key role in the modern financial literature.

The approach of structural-form models assume that the bankruptcy process is explicated. It defines that both of the events can trigger the default and the pay-offs to the bondholders at a default state in terms of company assets and liabilities. Therefore, this approach is only able to produce price under the extremely simplistic assumption on capital structure. However, these models require a certain level of abstraction about bankruptcy according to its traceability. The main problem is that the asset volatility employed in structural models is not directly observable and it has to be estimated indirectly by using different indicators such as equity volatility. Several recent studies show the difficulty in structural models to explain yield spreads (Huang and Huang 2012; Bao 2009; Cremers et al. 2008; Eom et al. 2004; Schaefer and Strebulaev 2008; Chen et al. 2007).

The reduced form models (or statistical approach) originated with the study of Jarrow and Turnbull (1995), Duffie and Singleton (1999) among others, are based on a statistical approach and they are abstracted away completely from the

economic definition of bankruptcy and default treats that are considered as exogenously specified process. This approach is traceable and it is usually used in pricing default risk. In this perspective, any default free term structure model can be used to price bonds with default risk.

The studies on accounting models focus on company fundamentals. They were born with the pioneering works Beaver (1966, 1968) that applied a unique statistical analysis for the prediction of corporate failure and Altman (1968) developed the Z-Score model in order to identify accounting variables and financial ratios to measure the company's default risk. Following several models are developed. The same Z-score model has been revised by starting the second generation of the model with several enhancements (Altman et al. 1977). After, the Z-score model has been modified for its application in the context of corporations in emerging markets (Altman et al. 1995).

By following a similar approach Ohlson (1980) its O-Score Mode has been developed with the identification of nine ratios capable of predicting bankruptcy, Taffler (1984) developed the UK-based Z-Score model that is one of the most commonly used Z-Score model, and Zmijewski (1984) developed the Probit Analysis developed a hybrid logistic model. Also, Bathia (1988) and Shaoo et al. (1996) examined the predictive power of accounting ratios on a sample of sick and non-sick companies by using the multiple discriminating analysis and Lennox (1999) in his study showed that profitability, leverage and cash flows have relevant effects on the probability of company's default as Kim et al. (1993).

Over the time several empirical tests have illustrated the relevance of the models developed (Agarwal and Taffler 2007; Baninoe 2010; Kumar and Kumar 2012; Shumway 2011).

Finally, several studies show the effect of debt on the competitive strategy of the company and its profitability over time. There are two main contrasting theories: the first states that a high debt level gives the company the opportunity to invest many resources in the business by increasingly acquiring a share of the market (Brander and Lewis 1986); the second states that a high debt level leads the company to increase prices on the short-term in order to secure short-term profit. It is due to the higher discounting rate associated with the higher default probability of the levered company (Chevalier and Scharfstein 1996; Dasgupta and Titman 1998). Several empirical studies have found support for each of these theories (see Parson and Titman 2008).

In this context, the cost of debt  $(\mathrm{K_D})$  is structured on three parts (Elton et al. 2013):

- the first, is the financial cost of time and it can be calculated approximately according to the risk-free rate. It can be approximated to the return of risk-free government bond and therefore it measures the return on default-free bonds;
- the second, is the market risk-premium due to the higher volatility of the corporate bonds than government bonds;
- the third, is the default risk of corporate bonds due to the risk of the bond-holder's loss in the case of company insolvency.

Among these, the third part is the most relevant in this context. Indeed, debt cost is based on a fundamental analysis of the company rather than the volatility of the asset's value on the market. In this regard, the cost of debt is based on the relationship between debt level and the economic and financial dynamics with regards to Operating and Net Income, Capital Invested and Capital Structure and Free Cash-Flow from Operations and Equity.

On the basis of these three main parts, the cost of debt  $(\mathbf{K}_{\mathrm{D}})$  can be defined equal to (De Luca 2017):

$$
\mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}} = \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \left(\mathrm {Y C} _ {\mathrm {M}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}}\right) + \rho \mathrm {e} ^ {\delta} \tag {7.90}
$$

where:

-  $R_{F}$ : is the risk-free rate;
-  $YC_{M}$ : is the expected medium market yield of corporate bonds;
-  $(\mathrm{YC_M} - \mathrm{R_F})$ : is the difference between the expected medium market yield and the risk-free rate and it measures the market risk premium of corporate bonds due to their higher risk than government bonds;
-  $\delta$ : is a composite index that measures the company's ability to face debt obligations based on its fundamentals;
-  $e^{\delta}$ : is the exponential function that measures the default risk of the company based on its fundamentals. The exponential function is used for two main reasons: first, it highlights the negative effects of debt when debt increases; second, it can be approximated with a quadratic form that is compatible with mean-variance approach. It is expressed on based 100 ( $e^{\delta} = e^{\delta} / 100$ );
-  $\rho$ : is a discretionary variable. It goes between zero and one ( $0 \leq \rho \leq 1$ ) and it defines the part of default risk that investor wants to assume.

Equation (7.90) can be divided in three main parts:

-  $R_F$ : is the risk-free rate and it is the time value of money. It can be approximated to the return of riskless government bonds and therefore it measures the return on default-free bonds;
-  $(\mathrm{YC_M} - \mathrm{R_F})$ : is the market risk-premium of corporate bonds due to their higher risk than government bonds;
-  $\rho e^{\delta}$ : is the default premium and it measures the specific risk of default of the company due to its incapability to face debt obligations.

Therefore, the second and third parts of Eq. (7.90) measure the spread on debt  $(S_{D})$  and therefore its default risk  $(D_F)$ :

$$
S _ {D} \equiv D _ {F} = \left(\mathrm {Y C} _ {\mathrm {M}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}}\right) + \rho \mathrm {e} ^ {\delta} \tag {7.91}
$$

The composite index  $(\delta)$  measures the company's abilities to face debt obligations on the basis of its fundamentals. It can be defined as follows:

# 7.3 Cost of Debt

$$
\delta = \gamma_ {1} + \gamma_ {2} + \gamma_ {3} \tag {7.92}
$$

where  $\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}$  and  $\gamma_{3}$  are the composite index coefficients defined on the company's fundamentals.

The composite index coefficient  $\gamma_{1}$  is equal to the ratio between Cash-flows out for Debt Commitment (CDC) and the Current Operating Cash-flows  $\left(\mathrm{CFO}_{\mathrm{(A)}}\right)$  realized in the period considered, as follows:

$$
\gamma_ {1} = \frac {\mathrm {C D C}}{\mathrm {C F O} _ {(\mathrm {A})}} \quad 0 \leq \gamma_ {1} \leq 1 \tag {7.93}
$$

The  $\mathrm{CFO}_{\mathrm{(A)}}$  can be defined as equal to the EBITDA plus the changes in the Net Operating Capital Invested (NOCI) that it is equal to the sum of investments in Capex and Net Working Capital.

The CDC can be defined equal to the Interest on Debt in the period  $(DK_{D})$  plus the Share of Debt (principal) to be reimbursed in the period based on the debt level at the start of the period  $(\alpha D)$ , as follows:

$$
\mathrm {C D C} = \alpha \mathrm {D} + \mathrm {D K} _ {\mathrm {D}} = \mathrm {D} (\alpha + \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}}) \tag {7.94}
$$

On the basis of Eq. (7.94), Eq. (7.93) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\gamma_ {1} = \frac {\mathrm {D} (\alpha + \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}})}{\mathrm {C F O} _ {(\mathrm {A})}} \quad 0 \leq \gamma_ {1} \leq 1 \tag {7.95}
$$

Equation (7.95) shows how the lower the distance between CDC and  $\mathrm{CFO}_{\mathrm{(A)}}$  the higher the default risk due to the company's inability to face debt obligations.

Note that if the company is financed by equity only, the coefficient is equal to zero. Otherwise, if the company is financed by equity and debt, the limit of coefficient is equal to one and consequently the CDC is equal to  $\mathrm{CFO}_{\mathrm{(A)}}$ . When the value of the coefficient is greater than one, the company is unable to face debt obligations and therefore it can be considered in default.

The composite index coefficient  $\gamma_{2}$  is equal to the ratio between the Financial Debt  $(D)$  (book value) and Liquid Assets  $(LA)$ , as follows:

$$
\gamma_ {2} = \frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {L A}} \quad 0 \leq \gamma_ {2} <   \varepsilon \tag {7.96}
$$

The LA refers to tangible, intangible and financial assets, credit, inventors. In order for an asset to be considered as Liquid, it must be characterized by two elements: (i) a market value; (ii) marketable in the short-time.

If the amount of implemented liquid assets is greater than the amount of debt, they can be used to satisfy the bondholders' expectations; otherwise, if the debt amount is greater than liquid assets implemented, even if they sold them on the market the bondholder's expectations cannot be completely satisfied.

Therefore, this coefficient measures the coverage of debt obligations in the case of insolvency case and therefore it is a measure of the bondholders' guaranty. The more the liquid assets are in place, the higher the bondholder's guaranty in the case of insolvency. Otherwise, the greater the debt than the liquid assets, the greater the bondholders' risk.

Note that if the company is all-equity financed, the coefficient is equal to zero. Otherwise, if the company is financed by equity and debt, the coefficient can change between zero and value  $\varepsilon$ : it is defined by the bondholders on the basis of their risk aversion. In any case,  $\varepsilon = 1$  can be considered the alert point.

The composite index coefficient  $\gamma_{3}$ , is equal to the ratio between Cash-flows to Equity Net Current Debt  $(CFNE_{(A)})$  and Cash-flows to Equity Net Debt Expected  $(CFNE_{(E)})$  with regards to the same period, as follows:

$$
\gamma_ {3} = \left(1 - \frac {\mathrm {C F N E} _ {(\mathrm {A})}}{\mathrm {C F N E} _ {(\mathrm {E})}}\right) \quad 0 \leq \gamma_ {3} <   \varepsilon \tag {7.97}
$$

Note the dividends may be paid in debt. In this case the increase in debt is not used to increase the investments but to pay dividends. The company reduces its capabilities to increase the future CFO and CFE. Therefore, Cash-flows to Equity Net of Debt Increases (CFNE) are considered. In this sense, it is possible to define CFNE equal to the CFO minus the CDC, as follows:

$$
\mathrm {C F N E} = \mathrm {C F O} - \mathrm {C D C} \tag {7.98}
$$

And by considering Eq. (7.94), we have:

$$
\mathrm {C F N E} = \mathrm {C F O} - \mathrm {D} (\alpha + \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}}) \tag {7.99}
$$

The positive amount of the CFNE indicates the dividend amount for the shareholders; otherwise its negative amount indicates the increase in equity to cover the company's needs.

The smaller the difference between CFNE Current and Expected, the greater is the shareholders' satisfaction and higher is the company's capability to raise capital on favourable conditions in financial markets. Therefore, the coefficient  $\gamma_{3}$  can be considered a proxy of the discipline effects of debt on management (Jensen and Meckling 1976; Jensen 1986). High debt level allows for management to invest capital in positive net present value projects that increase the CFO and the CFE with maximization of the equity value.

In this context, it is reasonable to assume:

(a) CFNE Expected (CFNE  $\mathbf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{(E)}}$  ) is the maximum value for the CFNE;
(b) CFNE Current (CFNE  $\mathrm{(A)}$  ) cannot be higher than  $\mathrm{CFNE}_{\mathrm{(E)}}$

Therefore,  $\gamma_{3} = 0$  is the maximum value of the coefficient and represents the best conditions. In this case the company maximizes the equity value because the shareholders' expectations are achieved.

# 7.3 Cost of Debt

Otherwise, the lower the CFNE  $\mathrm{(A)}$  compared with the CFNE  $\mathrm{(E)}$ , the higher the coefficient value. In absence of the CFNE  $\mathrm{(A)}$  the coefficient is equal  $\gamma_{3} = 1$ . Note that the coefficient value is higher than  $1\left(\gamma_{3} > 1\right)$  if the CFNE  $\mathrm{(A)}$  is negative.

By considering Eq. (7.99), Eq. (7.97) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\gamma_ {3} = \left[ 1 - \frac {C F O _ {(A)} - D (\alpha + K _ {D})}{C F O _ {(E)} - D (\alpha + K _ {D})} \right]
$$

and then:

$$
\gamma_ {3} = \left[ \frac {C F O _ {(E)} - C F O _ {(A)}}{C F O _ {(E)} - D (\alpha + K _ {D})} \right] \tag {7.100}
$$

On the basis of the three composite index coefficients  $\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2},\gamma_{3}$  as defined by Eqs. (7.95), (7.96) and (7.100) respectively, the composite index  $\delta$  as defined in Eq. (7.92) can be explicated as follows:

$$
\delta = \frac {D (\alpha + K _ {D})}{C F O _ {(A)}} + \frac {D}{L A} + \frac {C F O _ {(E)} - C F O _ {(A)}}{C F O _ {(E)} - D (\alpha + K _ {D})} \tag {7.101}
$$

Denoting the difference between  $CFO_{(E)}$  and  $CFO_{(A)}$  as follows:

$$
\Delta_ {(E - A)} ^ {C F O} = C F O _ {(E)} - C F O _ {(A)} \tag {7.102}
$$

And substituting, Eq. (7.101) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\delta = D \left[ \frac {\left(\alpha + K _ {D}\right)}{C F O _ {(A)}} + \frac {1}{L A} \right] + \left[ \frac {\Delta_ {(E - A)} ^ {C F O}}{C F O _ {(E)} - D (\alpha + K _ {D})} \right] \tag {7.103}
$$

Equation (7.103) is the composite index  $(\delta)$  able to measures the default risk of the firm on the basis of its fundamentals.

The cost of debt as defined by Eq. (7.90) can be explicated on the basis of the composite index  $(\delta)$  as defined in Eq. (7.103), as follows:

$$
\mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}} = \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \left(\mathrm {Y C} _ {\mathrm {M}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}}\right) + \rho \mathrm {e} ^ {\left\{\mathrm {D} \left[ \frac {\left(\alpha + \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}}\right)}{\mathrm {C F O} _ {(\mathrm {A})}} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {L A}} \right] + \left[ \frac {\Delta_ {(\mathrm {E} - \mathrm {A})} ^ {\mathrm {C F O}}}{\mathrm {C F O} _ {(\mathrm {E})} - \mathrm {D} \left(\alpha + \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}}\right)} \right] \right\}} \tag {7.104}
$$

Equation (7.104) shows how the cost of debt is function of three parts:

- the risk-free rate  $(R_F)$  that is the time value of money and is measured on the basis of the expected return of government bonds. Its analysis is developed in Chap. 10;
- the market risk-premium  $(\mathrm{YC_M} - \mathrm{R_F})$  of corporate bonds compared with government bonds on the basis of higher risk of corporate bonds than government bonds;

$$
- \text {t h e d e f a u l t p r e m i u m} \left(\rho e ^ {\left\{\mathrm {D} \left[ \frac {\left(\alpha + \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}}\right)}{\mathrm {C F O} _ {(\mathrm {A})}} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {L A}} \right] + \left[ \frac {\Delta_ {(\mathrm {E} - \mathrm {A})} ^ {\mathrm {C F O}}}{\mathrm {C F O} _ {(\mathrm {E})} - \mathrm {D} \left(\alpha + \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}}\right)} \right] \right\}}\right) \text {t h a t m e a s u r e s t h e}
$$

# 7.4 Cost of Capital of the Company

The estimate of capital cost of the company is one of the most difficult topics for managers and financial economists.

The most widely used model to estimate the cost of capital is the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). Its equation is simple.

Denote with  $\mathrm{K_{EL}}$  the cost of equity of the levered company (the Levered Cost of Equity) that measures the expected return of investors in equity;  $\mathrm{K_D}$  the cost of debt of the levered company that measures the expected return of investors in debt;  $\mathrm{E}$  the value of equity in the capital structure and  $\mathrm{E} / (E + D)$  the weight of equity in the capital structure;  $D$  the value of debt in the capital structure and  $\mathrm{D} / (E + D)$  the weight of debt in the capital structure;  $\mathrm{t_c}$  the corporate tax of the company. The WACC estimates the cost of capital for the company firm  $(\mathrm{K_A})$  as follows:

$$
\mathrm {W A C C} \equiv \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {A}} = \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {E L}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {E}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right) + \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right) \tag {7.105}
$$

and by introducing the corporate taxes  $(\mathrm{t_c})$  , we have:

$$
\mathrm {W A C C} \equiv \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {A}} = \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {E L}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {E}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right) + \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right) \left(1 - \mathrm {t} _ {\mathrm {c}}\right) \tag {7.106}
$$

The WACC is usually used in assessments to discount the expected operating cash flows of the company. However, its use is not always correct as its logical and methodological derivation is not considered. The WACC, as the most widely used models to estimate the cost of capital, derives from the Modigliani-Miller studies. Specifically, the WACC is a strict derivation of the Propositions of MM (1958).

On the basis of the Propositions, the value of the company is function of the value of its assets only and it is independent of the capital structure. The company's value is estimated on the basis of its expected operating cash flows discounted at a risk rate of the k-th class within which the company is placed. Therefore, this risk rate is completely independent from the capital structure. Consequently, the value of the company is constant compared with the capital structure. Then, the WACC is a constant compared with the capital structure and it only measures the expected return by investors based on the risk undertaken in the capital markets as defined by risk rate of the k-class of risk of the company. Formally:

# Wacc $\equiv K_{a}$ Costant

The  $K_{A}$  is the risk rate at which the operating cash flow of the company is discounted. It is defined on the basis of the rick class of the company in the capital market independently by its capital structure.

Note that if the company is financed by equity only, the WACC is equal to the Cost of Equity of Unlevered Firm and therefore the Unlevered Cost of Equity  $(K_{EU})$ :

# Wacc $\equiv K_{A}\equiv K_{eu}$

On the basis of these considerations, it is possible to explicit Eq. (7.105) in terms of levered cost of equity  $(\mathrm{K_{EL}})$  as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {E L}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {E}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right) = K _ {A} - \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right); \quad \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {E L}} = \frac {K _ {A} - \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right)}{\left(\frac {\mathrm {E}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right)}; \\ \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {E L}} = \left[ K _ {A} - \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right) \right] \left(\frac {\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E}}\right); \quad \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {E L}} = K _ {A} \left(\frac {\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E}}\right) - \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right) \left(\frac {\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E}}\right); \\ \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {E L}} = K _ {A} \left(\frac {\mathrm {E}}{\mathrm {E}}\right) + K _ {A} \left(\frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E}}\right) - \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E}}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

and therefore:

$$
\mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {E L}} = K _ {\mathrm {A}} + \left(K _ {\mathrm {A}} - \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}}\right) \left(\frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E}}\right) \tag {7.107}
$$

Similar by explicating Eq. (7.106) on the basis of levered cost of equity  $(\mathrm{K_{EL}})$  we have:

$$
K _ {E L} = K _ {A} + \left[ K _ {A} - K _ {D} \left(1 - t _ {\mathrm {c}}\right) \right] \frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E}} \tag {7.108}
$$

Equations (7.107) and (7.108) define the levered cost of equity of the company as a direct derivation of Propositions I and II of MM.

Considering that  $K_{A}$  is constant and it measures the expected return of investors for operating cash flow based on the risk k-class of the company, it can be interpreted as the expected return of investors in equity of all equity financed companies. Therefore, it is possible to replace  $K_{A}$  with the Unlevered Cost of Equity ( $K_{EU}$ ) (Massari and Zanetti 2008). In this sense, Eq. (7.107) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
K _ {E L} = K _ {E U} + \left(K _ {E U} - K _ {D}\right) \frac {D}{E} \tag {7.109}
$$

and Eq. (7.108) can be re-written as follows:

$$
K _ {E L} = K _ {E U} + \left[ K _ {E U} - K _ {D} \left(1 - t _ {\mathrm {c}}\right) \right] \frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E}} \tag {7.110}
$$

Obviously in both cases,  $K_{EU}$  is a constant in the equation and it is independent of the company's capital structure.

A relevant problem concerns the rate used to discount expected tax savings. Usually, tax savings are discounted to the cost of debt as in the Propositions of MM. The main reason is that tax savings arising from debt and subsequently the risk of expected tax savings is strictly related to the risk of debt. Therefore, the company does not achieve tax savings if it is unable to face debt obligations. Consequently, it is possible to discount the expected tax savings by the cost of debt  $(K_{D})$ . Several studies are placed in a critical way and highlight the need to use the unlevered cost of equity  $(K_{EU})$  to discount the expected tax savings (Miles and Ezzell 1980; Taggart 1991; Kaplan and Ruback 1995; Ruback 2002). The main argument is that the debt level is known in the first year only. Consequently, only in this case is it possible to use the cost of debt to discount the expected tax savings. In each year other than the first, the debt level is unknown because the company levered value is unknown; it is function of the tax savings that, in turn, are function of the debt level that is unknown. Consequently, the risk of expected tax savings is similar to the risk on the value of company assets and therefore they must be discounted to the unlevered cost of equity  $(K_{EU})$ .

On the basis of these considerations and Eqs. (7.107) and (7.108) in the WACC's approach, the cost of equity cannot be estimated until the leverage ratio has been defined that, in turn, requires an estimate of the company levered value, representing the aim of the analysis in which the WACC is used as a discount rate. Consequently, the WACC can only be used if the debt level is an exogenous variable and, therefore, it is defined and well-known (Harris and Pringle 1985). In other words, the WACC can be used only if the debt level is defined. Consequently they are not useful to evaluate the change in leverage.

In this context, the Levered Cost of Capital (LCC) is proposed (De Luca 2017).

The LCC proposed is a theoretical model with normative function that tries to overcome the WACC's limits by defining the relationship, based on an exponential function between the debt level and the cost of debt for the company. This relationship is defined on the basis of the trade-off approach by considering the effects, both positive (mainly with regards to the tax shields) and negative (mainly with regards to the default risk) of the debt level on the cost of debt and therefore on the levered cost of capital. Consequently, it can be used to estimate the effects of the debt level changes on the levered cost of capital and therefore on the company value.

By using the cost of equity and the cost of debt, the LCC is a function of the company's capital structure and it measures the expected return of company investors in equity and in debt.

Specifically, LCC estimates the cost of capital of the company on the basis of an exponential function between risk and debt level: on the one hand, the increase in leverage increases the benefits due to the tax shields by reducing the LCC but, on the other hand, it increases the default risk probability. Consequently, on the basis of these two effects, LCC draws a curve with a minimum point identifying the debt level that minimized the cost of capital.

The LCC can be used to define the debt level of the company by measuring its effects on the cost of capital. In fact, a change in the debt level changes the cost of debt and then the cost of capital along the curve.

The basic assumptions of LCC are the following:

(1) the capital structure is based on two capital sources: equity and debt. Hybrid forms are not considered. Also, it is assumed that the company uses a single class of equity and debt;
(2) the cost of capital measures the cost of sources invested in the company. Consequently, it can be interpreted as the expected return of investors: the expected return by investors in equity is the cost of equity for the company as the expected return by investors in debt is the cost of debt for the company;
(3) the investor is diversified;
(4) it is considered a one-period time with no events between the start and the end of the period. In each time period, the company defines its debt level;
(5) there is a single class of zero coupon risky debt of maturity;
(6) the cost of debt is defined based on the debt level at the start of the period;
(7) the investors personal taxes on debt and equity are not considered;
(8) the share of debt paid at the end of the year is based on the debt level from the start of the year.

Based on the portfolio theory (Markowitz 1952) the cost of equity can be derived from the CAPM (Sharpe 1964; Lintner 1965; Mossin 1966) as defined in Eq. (7.65) as follows:

$$
\mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {E}} = \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \beta (\mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {M}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}}) \leftrightarrow \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {E}} = \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \frac {\sigma (R _ {\mathrm {M}} ; R _ {\mathrm {F}})}{\sigma^ {2} (R _ {\mathrm {M}})} (\mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {M}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}})
$$

The cost of debt is defined as in Eq. (7.104) as follows:

$$
\mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}} = \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \left(\mathrm {Y C} _ {\mathrm {M}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}}\right) + \rho \mathrm {e} ^ {\left\{\mathrm {D} \left[ \frac {\left(\alpha + \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}}\right)}{\mathrm {C F O} _ {\left(\mathrm {A}\right)}} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {L A}} \right] + \left[ \frac {\Delta_ {\left(\mathrm {E} - \mathrm {A}\right)} ^ {\mathrm {C F O}}}{\mathrm {C F O} _ {\left(\mathrm {E}\right)} - \mathrm {D} \left(\alpha + \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}}\right)} \right] \right\}}
$$

On the basis of the cost of equity as defined by Eq. (7.65) and the cost of debt as defined by Eq. (7.104), the Levered Cost of Capital (LCC) of the company  $(\mathrm{K_L})$  can be estimated as follows:

$$
\mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {L}} = \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {E}} - \mathrm {L} \left[ \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {E}} - \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}} \left(1 - \mathrm {t} _ {\mathrm {c}}\right) \right] \tag {7.111}
$$

where:

$$
\mathrm {L} = \frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}} \rightarrow 1 - \mathrm {L} = \frac {\mathrm {E}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}} \tag {7.112}
$$

Note that on the basis of Eq. (7.112), Eq. (7.111) can be expressed in a form similar to the WACC as follows:

$$
\mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {L}} = \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {E}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {E}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right) + \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {D}} \left(\frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right) \left(1 - \mathrm {t} _ {\mathrm {c}}\right) \tag {7.113}
$$

The structure of the LCC  $(\mathrm{K_L})$ , as defined by Eq. (7.113) is only formally similar to the WACC. Indeed, they are very different in construction. There are three main differences:

- first, the WACC is defined by market as function of the risk class of the company and it is used to discount the unlevered cash flows assuming an all-equity financed company. On the other hand, the LCC is based on an estimate of the cost of equity and the cost of debt on the basis of the expected return of the investors in equity and debt, respectively. Then, the LCC is a direct function of the company capital structure. It is used to discount unlevered cash flows of the company because they are the source to satisfy expectations of investors in equity and debt;
- second, the WACC is based on the assumption of a linear relationship between the cost of capital and leverage. Differently, the LCC is estimated on the basis of a non-linear relationship between leverage and the cost of capital. The LCC is estimated by assuming an exponential function between risk and debt level. The increase of leverage, on the one hand, increases the benefits due to tax shields by reducing the LCC but, on the other hand, it increases the default risk probability. Based on these two effects, the LCC draws a curve with a minimum point that defines the debt level that minimizes the cost of capital;
- third, in WACC the debt level is assumed constant and well-known. Differently, in the LCC the definition of debt level is function of its effects on the cost of capital. By a change in the debt level, there is a change in the cost of debt and therefore the cost of capital along the curve. Also, this is the main difference between LCC and the ME's cost of capital model.

By substituting Eqs. (7.65) and (7.104), in Eq. (7.111) the LCC  $(\mathbf{K}_{\mathrm{L}})$  is equal to:

# 7.4 Cost of Capital of the Company

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {L}} = \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \beta \left(\mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {M}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}}\right) \\ - \mathbf {L} \left[ \left(\mathbf {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \beta \left(\mathbf {R} _ {\mathrm {M}} - \mathbf {R} _ {\mathrm {F}}\right)\right) \right. \\ \left. - \left(R _ {\mathrm {F}} + \left(\mathrm {Y C} _ {\mathrm {M}} - R _ {\mathrm {F}}\right) + \rho e ^ {D \left(\frac {\left(\alpha + K _ {\mathrm {D}}\right)}{C F O _ {(\mathrm {A})}} + \frac {1}{L A}\right) + \left(\frac {\Delta_ {(\mathrm {E} - \mathrm {A})} ^ {C F O}}{C F O _ {(\mathrm {E})} - D \left(\alpha + K _ {\mathrm {D}}\right)}\right)}\right) (1 - t _ {\mathrm {c}}) \right] \tag {7.114} \\ \end{array}
$$

Placing:

$$
\begin{array}{l} - A = K _ {E} = R _ {F} + \beta \left(R _ {M} - R _ {F}\right); \\ - F = R _ {F} + \left(Y C _ {M} - R _ {F}\right); \\ - \quad H = \frac {\alpha + K _ {D (- 1)}}{C F O _ {(A)}} + \frac {1}{L A}; \\ - I = \Delta_ {(E - A)} ^ {C F O} = C F O _ {(E)} - C F O _ {(A)} \\ - M = C F O _ {(E)}; \\ - N = \alpha + K _ {D}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Equation (7.114) can be simplified as follows:

$$
K _ {L} = A - L \left[ A - \left(\left(F + \rho e ^ {\left(D H + \frac {I}{M - D N}\right)}\right) \left(1 - t _ {c}\right)\right) \right] \tag {7.115}
$$

or in an equivalent form:

$$
\mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {L}} = \mathrm {A} - \left(\frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right) \left\{\mathrm {A} - \left[ \left(\mathrm {F} + \rho \mathrm {e} ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)}\right) \left(1 - \mathrm {t} _ {\mathrm {c}}\right) \right] \right\} \tag {7.116}
$$

Equations (7.115) or (7.116) draws a function continuously and differentiable at least twice by construction. The main problem is to prove that the function has a minimum point. Indeed, in this case it defines the minimum level of the LCC and then the minimum level of the cost of capital of the company. Consequently, on the basis of effects of the debt level changes on the LCC, the company can choose the debt level that minimizes the LCC.

The first derivative compared with the debt of Eq. (7.116) is the following:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {L}} = \mathrm {A} - \left(\frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right) \left\{\mathrm {A} - \left[ \left(\mathrm {F} + \rho \mathrm {e} ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)}\right) (1 - \mathrm {t} _ {\mathrm {c}}) \right] \right\} \\ = A - \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) \left\{A - \left[ F - F t _ {c} + \rho e ^ {\left(D H + \frac {1}{M - D N}\right)} - t _ {c} \rho e ^ {\left(D H + \frac {1}{M - D N}\right)} \right] \right\} \\ = \mathrm {A} - \left(\frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right) \left[ \mathrm {A} - \mathrm {F} + \mathrm {F t} _ {\mathrm {c}} - \rho \mathrm {e} ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {\mathrm {I}}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} + \mathrm {t} _ {\mathrm {c}} \rho \mathrm {e} ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {\mathrm {I}}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} \right] \\ = A - \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) A + \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) F - \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) F t _ {c} + \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) p e ^ {\left(D H + \frac {1}{M - D N}\right)} \\ - \left(\frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D}}\right) t _ {\mathrm {c}} \rho e ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} \\ \end{array}
$$

By considering that:

$$
\begin{array}{l} - \frac {\partial}{\partial D} [ A ] = 0; \\ - \frac {\partial}{\partial D} \left[ \frac {D}{E + D} \right] = \frac {E + D - D}{(E + D) ^ {2}} = \frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}}; \\ - \frac {\partial}{\partial D} [ D H ] = H; \\ - \frac {\partial}{\partial D} \left[ \frac {I}{M - D N} \right] = \frac {- I (- N)}{(M - D N) ^ {2}} = \frac {I N}{(M - D N) ^ {2}}; \\ - \frac {\partial}{\partial D} \left[ e ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {I}{M - D N}\right)} \right] = e ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {I}{M - D N}\right)} \left(H + \frac {I N}{(M - D N) ^ {2}}\right); \\ - \frac {\partial}{\partial D} \left[ \rho e ^ {\left(D H + \frac {1}{M - D N}\right)} \right] = \rho e ^ {\left(D H + \frac {1}{M - D N}\right)} \left(H + \frac {I N}{(M - D N) ^ {2}}\right); \\ - \frac {\partial}{\partial D} \left[ \rho t _ {c} e ^ {\left(D H + \frac {1}{M - D N}\right)} \right] = \rho t _ {c} e ^ {\left(D H + \frac {1}{M - D N}\right)} \left(H + \frac {I N}{(M - D N) ^ {2}}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

We have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\partial}{\partial D} \left[ \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {L}} \right] = - \left[ \frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}} \right] A + \left[ \frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}} \right] F - \left[ \frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}} \right] F t _ {\mathrm {c}} \\ + \left\{\left[ \frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}} \right] \rho e ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} + \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) \rho e ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} \left(\mathrm {H} + \frac {I N}{(M - D N) ^ {2}}\right) \right\} \\ - \left\{\left[ \frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}} \right] \rho t _ {\mathrm {c}} e ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} - \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) \rho t _ {\mathrm {c}} e ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} \left(\mathrm {H} + \frac {I N}{(M - D N) ^ {2}}\right) \right\} \\ \end{array}
$$

And then:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\partial}{\partial D} \left[ \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {L}} \right] = - \left[ \frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}} \right] A + \left[ \frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}} \right] F - \left[ \frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}} \right] F t _ {\mathrm {c}} + \left[ \frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}} \right] p e ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} \\ + \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) \rho e ^ {\left(D H + \frac {1}{M - D N}\right)} \left(H + \frac {I N}{(M - D N) ^ {2}}\right) - \left[ \frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}} \right] \rho t _ {c} e ^ {\left(D H + \frac {1}{M - D N}\right)} \\ - \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) \rho t _ {\mathrm {c}} e ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} \left(\mathrm {H} + \frac {I N}{(M - D N) ^ {2}}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

And then:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\partial}{\partial D} \left[ \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {L}} \right] = \left[ \frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}} \right] \left\{- A + F - F \mathrm {t} _ {\mathrm {c}} + \rho \mathrm {e} ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} - \rho \mathrm {t} _ {\mathrm {c}} \mathrm {e} ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} \right\} \\ + \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) \left\{\rho e ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} \left(\mathrm {H} + \frac {I N}{(M - D N) ^ {2}}\right) \right. \\ \left. - \rho t _ {c} e ^ {\left(D H + \frac {1}{M - D N}\right)} \left(H + \frac {I N}{(M - D N) ^ {2}}\right) \right\} \\ \end{array}
$$

And then:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\partial}{\partial D} \left[ \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {L}} \right] = \left[ \frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}} \right] \left\{F \left(1 - t _ {\mathrm {c}}\right) + \rho e ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} \left(1 - t _ {\mathrm {c}}\right) - A \right\} \\ + \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) \left\{\rho e ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{M - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} \left(\mathrm {H} + \frac {I N}{(M - D N) ^ {2}}\right) \left(1 - t _ {\mathrm {c}}\right) \right\} \\ \end{array}
$$

And then:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\partial}{\partial D} \left[ \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {L}} \right] = \left[ \frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}} \right] \left\{\left[ \left(F + \rho \mathrm {e} ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {\mathrm {I}}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {D N}}\right)}\right) (1 - t _ {\mathrm {c}}) \right] - A \right\} \tag {7.117} \\ + \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) \left\{\rho e ^ {\left(\mathrm {D H} + \frac {1}{M - \mathrm {D N}}\right)} \left(\mathrm {H} + \frac {I N}{(M - D N) ^ {2}}\right) \left(1 - t _ {\mathrm {c}}\right) \right\} \\ \end{array}
$$

Assume that the first derivative is a function defined and continued for each debt. By assuming that the debt level can be defined between 0 (all-equity financed) and 1 (all-debt financed), so that the sum of equity and debt is equal to 1, as follows:

$$
\forall \mathrm {D} \in [ 0; 1 ] \leftrightarrow \mathrm {E} + \mathrm {D} = 1 \tag {7.118}
$$

By using the intermediate value theorem, if the first derivative is negative in  $D = 0$  and it is positive in  $D = 1$ , there is a debt level  $D^{*}$  between 0 and 1 in which the first derivative is equal to zero. Formally:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \frac {\partial \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {L}}}{\partial \mathrm {D}} (\mathrm {D} = 0) <   0 \quad a n d \quad \frac {\partial \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {L}}}{\partial \mathrm {D} ^ {\prime}} (\mathrm {D} = 1) > 0 \end{array} \right\} \tag {7.119} \\ \Rightarrow \left\{\exists \mathrm {D} ^ {*} \in (0, 1): \frac {\partial \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {L}}}{\partial \mathrm {D}} (\mathrm {D} ^ {*}) = 0 \right\} \\ \end{array}
$$

Furthermore, if the first derivative is negative on the left of  $D^{*}$  and it is positive on the right, there is a minimum point necessary  $(D^{*})$ .

Based on Eq. (7.118) for  $D = 0(E = 1)$  the company is all-equity financed; otherwise, for  $D = 1(E = 0)$  the company is all debt financed. The value of the first derivative can be studied for  $D = 0$  and  $D = 1$ . These are the two points that define the function fields.

The value of the first derivative for  $D = 0$  is always negative, as follows:

$$
D = 0 \rightarrow \frac {\partial K _ {L}}{\partial D} = \left(\frac {1}{E}\right) [ F (1 - t _ {c}) - A ] \tag {7.120}
$$

Indeed, the equity risk is greater than the debt risk by definition, and therefore:

$$
\mathrm {A} \equiv \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {E}} = \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \beta_ {\mathrm {E}} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {M}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}}\right) > F = \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}} + \left(\mathrm {Y C} _ {\mathrm {M}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {F}}\right) \tag {7.121}
$$

Differently, the value of the first derivative for  $D = 1$  is always positive, as follows:

$$
\mathrm {D} = 1 \rightarrow \frac {\partial \mathrm {K} _ {\mathrm {L}}}{\partial \mathrm {D}} = \rho \mathrm {e} ^ {\left(\mathrm {H} + \frac {\mathrm {I}}{\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {N}}\right)} \left(\mathrm {H} + \frac {\mathrm {I N}}{(\mathrm {M} - \mathrm {N}) ^ {2}}\right) (1 - \mathrm {t} _ {\mathrm {c}}) \tag {7.122}
$$

Indeed, all terms of Eq. (7.120) are positive:

-  $0 < \rho \leq 1 \rightarrow \rho > 0 \forall D$ . Theoretically  $\rho \in (0; 1)$ . But if the company is all-debt financed, assuming  $\rho = 0$  is equivalent to assume a risk-free debt and it is difficult to assume. In this case it is right to assume  $\rho = 1$ ;
-  $H = \frac{\alpha + K_D}{CFO_{(A)}} + \frac{1}{LA} > 0 \, \forall D$ , because all element are positive by definition;
-  $IN = \Delta_{(E - A)}^{CFO}(\alpha + K_D) > 0 \, \forall D$ , because the first term is positive based on the assumption about CFO Current and Expected and the second term is always positive by definition;
-  $e^{\left(H + \frac{t}{M - N}\right)} > 0\forall D$  , by definition;
-  $(M - N)^{2} = \left(CFO_{(E)} - (\alpha + K_{D})\right)^{2} > 0 \forall D$ , by definition.

On the basis of Eqs. (7.120) and (7.122), it can be proved that there is a minimum point in the function LCC.

Explicating all variables, Eq. (7.117) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\partial K _ {L}}{\partial D} = \left(\frac {E}{(E + D) ^ {2}}\right) \left\{\left[ \left(R _ {F} + \left(Y C _ {M} - R _ {F}\right)\right) \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) - \left(R _ {F} + \beta_ {E} \left(R _ {M} - R _ {F}\right)\right) \right] \right. \\ \left. + \rho e ^ {\left[ D \left(\frac {\alpha + K _ {D}}{C F O _ {(A)}} + \frac {1}{L A}\right) + \frac {\Delta_ {(E - A)} ^ {C F O}}{C F O _ {(E)} - D (\alpha + K _ {D})} \right]} (1 - t _ {c}) \right\} \\ + \left(\frac {D}{E + D}\right) \rho e \left[ D \left(\frac {\alpha + K _ {D}}{C F O _ {(A)}} + \frac {1}{L A}\right) + \frac {\Delta_ {(E - A)} ^ {C F O}}{C F O _ {(E)} - D (\alpha + K _ {D})} \right] \left[ \left(\frac {\alpha + K _ {D}}{C F O _ {(A)}} + \frac {1}{L A}\right) \right. \\ \left. + \frac {\Delta_ {(E - A)} ^ {C F O} (\alpha + K _ {D})}{\left(C F O _ {(E)} - D (\alpha + K _ {D})\right) ^ {2}} \right] (1 - t _ {c}) \tag {7.123} \\ \end{array}
$$

The minimum point can be found by searching the root of the derivate in Eq. (7.123) by using numerical methods.

Therefore, the function of the LCC draws a curve with a minimum point as in Fig. 7.1. where the ordinate is the cost of capital and the abscissa is the debt level  $(D)$ .

The curve reflects the combined effects of the stock market rates and obligations (exogenous variable) and the company's specific default risk (endogenous variable). There are two main movements of the curve:

- the first refers to movement of the  $D^{*}$  point between 0 (all-equity financed) and 1 (all-debt financed) along the abscissa. This movement is mainly due to the company's fundamentals. If the company's default risk increases, point  $D^{*}$  moves to the left; otherwise, if it reduces, point  $D^{*}$  moves to the right. The left

Fig. 7.1 The debt level that minimizes the Levered Cost of Capital  $(\mathbf{K}_{\mathrm{L}})$

movement reduces the company's ability to face debt while the right movements increased it. It is mainly function of the operating cash flows and their capabilities to face debt obligations;

- the second refers to movement of the curve upwards and downwards along the ordinate. In this case it is mainly due to the market rates of stocks and obligations. Generally, by isolating the rate movements if:  $R_{M}$  or  $YC_{M}$  increase, the curve shift upwards;  $R_{M}$  or  $YC_{M}$  decrease, the curve shift downwards. The effect of the change  $R_{F}$  is due to the coefficient beta on equity and debt. It is relevant to note that if the distance between  $R_{M}$  and  $YC_{M}$  increases, ceteris paribus, the curve shifts upwards and point  $D^{*}$  moves to the right.
