# Enterprise Valuation

Abstract The company's value is a function of its ability to achieve positive performance in the future. The value of the company is equal to the present value of future expected cash flows and the cost of capital is used as a discount rate. In the previous Chapter an Equity Side perspective is adopted and the Equity Value is estimated. In this chapter the Asset Side perspective is adopted and the Enterprise Value is estimated. It is estimated on the basis of free cash-flows from operations discounted to the cost of capital based on the cost of equity and the cost of debt.

## 9.1 Free Cash Flow from Operations Discounted Model

The Enterprise Value is the value of operating assets of the company. It can be estimated by several models. Similar to Equity Value estimation the Enterprise Value is estimated by following a financial approach on the basis of Cash-Flow Discounted model (Altaman 1969; Arditti and Pinkerton 1978; Baron 1975; Bonnes and Jatusipitak 1972; Beaver and Morse 1978; Benninga 2014; Beidelman 1971; Berk and DeMarzo 2008; Bing 1971; Blume and Kraft 1977; Bower and Bower 1970; Brealey et al. 2016; Chen 1998; Copeland et al. 2004; Campbell and Shiller 1989; Corelli 2016; Damodaran 2012, 2015; Elton and Gruber 1971, 1976; Elton et al. 2013; Foster 1970; Fuller and Farrell 1987; Fuller and Hsia 1984; Gordon 1962; Graham et al. 1962; Haugen and Kumar 1974; Haugen and Pappas 1971; Hawkins 1977; Hillier et al. 2016; Joy and Jones 1970; Koller et al. 2015; Litzenberger and Budd 1970; Malkiel 1963; Malkiel and Cragg 1970; Modigliani and Miller 1958; Molodovsky et al. 1965; Myers 1974; Sydsaeter et al. 2012; Titman 1984; Vernimmen et al. 2014; Whitbeck and Kisor 1963; Williams 1938). Specifically, in this context the Free Cash-Flow from Operations (FCFO) are considered instead of Free Cash-Flow to Equity (FCFE) used in Equity Value. Indeed, the FCFO's are the cash flows generated by company operations and they are used for the remuneration of investors' both in equity and debt and to pay taxes.

Therefore, while in the Equity valuation models the equity-holders' cash flows is directly evaluated, in the Enterprise valuation models the cash flows available to all investors are evaluated: equity-holders, debt-holders, and any other non-equity investors.

The Enterprise valuation models are especially useful for multi-business companies. In this case, the Enterprise value is equal to the sum of individual operating units value less the present value of the corporate costs plus the value of non-operating assets.

Based on the FCFO, the Enterprise Value is estimated by Free Cash-Flow from Operations Discounted Model (EV-DM).

The EV-DM can be applied by following two main approaches (Damodaran 2012):

1. Cost of Capital (CC) approach: the Enterprise Value is estimated on the basis of Free Cash Flow from Operations (FCFO) discounted at a Cost of Capital by considering either the cost of equity and the cost of debt. In this approach the costs and benefits of debt are considered directly in the Cost of Capital used as a discounted rate of the future expected FCFO;
2. Adjusted Present Value (APV) approach: the Enterprise Value is estimated by distinguishing and summing three parts: (i) the unlevered value of enterprise, equal to the present value of the unlevered Free Cash Flow from Operations (FCFO); (ii) the value of the benefits on debt, equal to the present value of the tax savings due to the interests on debt; (iii) the value of the default risk due to the bankruptcy costs as function of leverage.

```d2

CC: Cost of Capital Approach {
  FCFO discounted at WACC/LCC
}

APV: Adjusted Present Value Approach {
  Unlevered value + tax shields - bankruptcy costs
}

Enterprise Value

CC -> Enterprise Value: Different results possible
APV -> Enterprise Value
```

These two approaches do not necessarily come up with the same Enterprise Value. There are three main reasons (Damodaran 2012; Koller et al. 2015):

- first, bankruptcy costs are considered in different ways in the two approaches. Specifically, indirect costs are more clearly defined in the APV approach than in the CC approach;
- second, the tax benefits from debt value are considered by the APV approach usually on the basis of the existing debt level. Differently, the CC approach estimates tax benefits after the definition of the debt level that is defined by finding the "optimal" leverage. Therefore, the cost of capital is used to define the debt level;
- third, in the APV approach the value of tax shield is estimated equal to the present value of the tax savings. The expected cash-flows of tax savings may be discounted at a rate different from Cost of Debt (such as the Cost of Unlevered Equity or Cost of Capital) by changing the Enterprise Value.

Generally, the CC approach is more useful in the case of ongoing company evaluation characterized by a sustainable capital structure. Differently, the APV approach is more useful in transactions based on a disproportionate debt level and where the debt repayment is negotiated or well known.

There is a relationship between the Enterprise Value and Equity Value. At any time, it is possible to estimate the Equity Value on the basis of the Enterprise Value and vice versa. Specifically, to the Equity Value (Enterprise Value) the following is sufficient:

- add (subtract) the value of non-operating activities, that are not included in the FCFO;
- subtract (add) the value of the Net Financial Position.

It is worth noting that the Equity Value estimated on the basis of the Enterprise Value and the Equity Value estimated directly are the same values only if consistent assumptions are made about financial leverage. Generally, the E-DM is preferred to the EV-DM if the company is characterized by a very high or low leverage. In both cases, it increases the difficulty to use the EV-DM while the effects of debts are captured directly in the FCFE.

There are three main problems of the EV-DM (Damodaran 2012):

- first, the FCFO's are less intuitive than the FCFE. While the FCFE represents the cash-flows used as dividends, the FCFO is an intermediate dimension of cash-flow used to analyse the company's ability to face debt obligations and to pay dividends;
- second, the FCFO can hide the real problem of company survival. If the company is characterized by a positive FCFO but a negative FCFE, the focus on FCFO could hide the problem. While the positivity of the first measures the company's ability to face debt obligations, the negativity of the second not only measures the company's inability to pay dividends, but the company's need for recapitalization;
- third, the EV-DM requires the inclusion in the cost of capital of all costs and benefits of debt. It requires the use of several assumptions with relevant effect on Enterprise Value.

The Free Cash-Flow from Operations Discounted Model (EV-DM) in the two versions, are analysed here below:

- Free Cash-Flow from Operations Discounted Model based on Cost of Capital approach (EV-DM<sub>CC</sub>)
- Free Cash-Flow from Operations Discounted Model based on Adjusted Present Value approach (EV-DM<sub>APV</sub});
Discounted Economic Profit (DEP).

## 9.2 Free Cash Flow from Operations Discounted Model: Cost of Capital Approach

The Free Cash-flow from Operations Discounted Model based on Cost of Capital approach  $(EV - DM_{CC})$  estimates the Enterprise Value equal to the present value of the Free Cash Flow from Operation (FCFO) discounted to the Cost of Capital (Damodaran 2012).

The cost of capital is estimated on the basis of the cost of equity and the cost of debt. Then it represents the expected returns of investors in equity and debt.

Therefore, this approach considers the capital structure problem and it translates the choices about debt level in the cost of capital. Consequently, the cost of capital estimation is the key variable in the model.

The cost of capital is usually estimated on the basis of the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). The Leverage Cost of Capital (LCC) as developed in Chap. 7, can be used instead of WACC. Indeed, while the WACC is based on the stable debt level, the LCC defines the cost of debt on the basis of debt level changes. Consequently, the LCC can be more useful than the WACC to define the "optimal" capital structure and to estimate the cost of capital. In any case, the equations use general definition of the cost of capital, denoted by  $\mathrm{K_A}$ , by leaving the reader the choice to use WACC or LCC.

The general version of the EV-DM $_{\mathrm{CC}}$  estimates the Enterprise Value  $(W_A)$  equal to the present value of expected FCFO discounted at the Cost of Capital  $(K_A)$  as follows:

$$
W _ {A} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {F C F F _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}} \tag {9.1}
$$

Equation (9.1) has a theoretical value only. Its applications require assumptions about its variables: FCFO, time  $(t)$  and the Cost of Capital  $(K_{A})$ .

Specifically, as shown in previous chapter, Eq. (9.1) can be applied as follows:

$$
W _ {A} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {F C F F _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}} + \frac {T V _ {n}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {n}} \tag {9.2}
$$

There are three main versions of the EV-DMCC (Damodaran 2012):

(a) Steady-state Growth EV-DMCC;
(b) Two-Stage Growth EV-DMCC;
(c) Three-Stage Growth EV-DMCC.

Therefore, conceptually these three versions are the same as in E-DM. Therefore, considerations developed in E-DM can be applied also in EV-DM<sub>CC</sub>.

## (a) Steady-State Growth Ev-dmcc

The Steady-State Growth  $EV - DM_{CC}$  estimates the Enterprise Value by assuming a constant growth rate in perpetuity in a steady-state scenario.

Therefore, the Enterprise Value  $(W_{A})$  is equal to the present value of di Free Cash-Flow from Operations in the next year and assumed in perpetuity  $(FCFO_{1})$  discounted at the cost of capital  $(K_{A})$  less the growth rate in perpetuity  $(g_{n})$  as follows:

$$
W _ {A} = \frac {F C F O _ {1}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}} \tag {9.3}
$$

Note that the  $FCFO_{1}$  must be estimated by assuming that they can be achieved each year over time in perpetuity. In this model, the estimation is synthetic and then it is not based on the analytical estimation of each FCFO item.

Therefore, the Enterprise Value is evaluated synthetically on the basis of the assumptions with regards to the growth rate and the cost of capital without any analytical estimation of the FCFO.

Equation (9.3) correct application requires two main conditions:

- the expected growth rate in perpetuity  $(g_{n})$  must be equal or lower than the expected growth rate of the economy or the business referencing of the company;
- the company characteristics are assumed unchangeable over time and it must be in line with the assumption of the stable growth. In this case the company's investments are not relevant because the growth margin is low. The best way to evaluate this second condition is to derive the re-investment rate by the stable growth rate and the return on investment in perpetuity (Damodaran 2012). Specifically, the Re-Investment Rate in stable growth condition  $(IR_{SG})$  can be estimated equal to the growth rate in a steady-state condition  $(g_n)$  divided by Return on Investment assumed stable over time  $(ROI_{SG})$ , as follows:

$$
I R _ {G S} = \frac {g _ {n}}{R O I _ {G S}}
$$

## (b) Two-Stage Growth Ev-dmcc

The Two-Stage Growth  $EV - DM_{CC}$  ( $2S - EV - DM_{CC}$ ) estimates the Enterprise Value by assuming two different growth periods:

- extraordinary growth period: the first period is the growth rate of dividend that cannot be considered stable over time. In this period lasting in the first  $n$  years ( $t = 1 \rightarrow t = n$ ) the growth rate of dividend can be higher or lower than the stable growth rate. The term "extraordinary" is used because the growth rate of dividends in this first period can be greater or lower than the second period;
- steady-state growth period: the second period is the growth rate of dividend and is assumed stable over time. In this second period ( $t = n + 1 \to t = \infty$ ) growth rate of dividend is assumed stable over time.

On the basis of these two periods, the 2S-EV-DM $_{\mathrm{CC}}$  estimates the Enterprise Value  $(W_A)$  equal to the present value of Free Cash Flow from Operations (FCFO) during the extraordinary growth period  $(g_e)$  plus the present value of Terminal Value  $(TV)$  estimated at the end of the extraordinary period for the steady-state growth period (second period) by assuming a constant growth rate in perpetuity

$(g_{n})$ . The discounted rate is the Cost of Capital  $(K_{A,eg}$  in the first period "extraordinary growth" and  $K_{A,\mathrm{sg}}$  in the second period "Steady-state growth"). Formally:

$$
W _ {A} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A , e g}\right) ^ {t}} + \frac {T V _ {n}}{\left(1 + K _ {A , s t}\right) ^ {n}} \tag {9.4}
$$

In the first period, the FCFO's are analytically estimated for each year (from  $t = 1$  to  $t = n$ ). Consequently, the extraordinary growth rate  $(g_e)$  is incorporated in the analytical estimation of FCFO and it is equal in each year as follows:

$$
g _ {e _ {t}} = \frac {F C F O _ {t} - F C F O _ {t - 1}}{F C F O _ {t - 1}} = \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{F C F O _ {t - 1}} - 1 \tag {9.5}
$$

The terminal value  $(TV)$  can be calculated by using steady-state growth rate  $(g_{n})$  in perpetuity as follows:

$$
T V _ {n} = \frac {F C F O _ {n + 1}}{K _ {A , s t} - g _ {n}} \tag {9.6}
$$

Note that the  $FCFO_{n+1}$  must be estimated by assuming their achievement over time in perpetuity. Therefore, it can be estimated independently to the FCFO of the first period.

Substituting Eq. (9.6), Eq. (9.4) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
W _ {A} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A , e g}\right) ^ {t}} + \frac {\frac {F C F O _ {n + 1}}{K _ {A , s t} - g _ {n}}}{\left(1 + K _ {A , s t}\right) ^ {n}}
$$

and therefore:

$$
W _ {A} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A , e g}\right) ^ {t}} + \frac {F C F O _ {n + 1}}{\left(K _ {A , s t} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {A , s t}\right) ^ {n}} \tag {9.7}
$$

Equation (9.7) can be divided in two parts:

- the first part is the present value of the expected FCFO estimated analytically for each year in the first period ( $t = 1 \rightarrow t = n$ ). In this first period, the growth rate ( $g_{e}$ ) can be defined extraordinary because it is different (higher or lower) from the steady-state growth rate ( $g_{n}$ ) used in the second period in perpetuity. Also  $g_{e}$  can be changed each year with regards to the previous year. Therefore, the first part of equation defines the "analytical value";
- the second part is the present value of the Terminal Value estimated on the basis of a synthetic estimation of the FCFO capable of being achieved each year in perpetuity. Consequently, in this second period the steady-state growth rate  $(g_{n})$

is used, assumed constant in perpetuity. Therefore, the second part of equation defines the "syntactical value".

Note that the Cost of Capital should be different in the two periods  $(K_{A,eg} \neq K_{A,sg})$ . In fact, it is based on the cost of equity and the cost of debt. Even if it is assumed that the cost of equity is the same, the cost of debt reflects the choices about capital structure. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the capital structure in the second period characterized by a steady-state condition may be different from the first period characterized by an extraordinary growth.

The 2S-EVDM $_{\mathrm{CC}}$  is useful for the company characterized by different growth rates. Specifically, the model can be used if the company is characterized by a growth rate in the first period higher or lower than the stable growth rate of the second period.

There are two main problems of the model (Damodaran 2012):

- first, it is difficult to estimate the length of the extraordinary growth period;
- second, the growth rate is assumed higher or lower in the first period and in declining or increasing at the end of the first period until a stable level characterises the second period. Even if it happens, it is reasonable to assume that the shift happens gradually over time.

By considering this second limit, it can be more useful the three-stage model.

## (c) Three-Stage Growth Ev-dmcc

The Three-Stage Growth EV-DM $_{CC}$  (3S-EV-DM $_{CC}$ ) estimates the Enterprise Value by assuming two different growth periods:

- Extraordinary growth period: it is the first period and it is characterized by high or low growth rate;
- Transitional growth period: it is the second period and it is characterized by a growth rate declining or increasing to reach a stable level;
- Steady-state growth period: it is the third period and it is characterized by a steady-state growth rate.

Therefore, the 3S-EV-  $\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{CC}}$  exceeds the limit of the 2S-EV-  $\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{CC}}$  by introducing a new step of growth. Indeed, the transitional growth period is used to gradually stabilize the extraordinary growth in the first period until the steady-state condition of the third period.

The 3S-EV-DM $_{\mathrm{CC}}$  estimates the Enterprise Value equal to the sum of present values of expected Free Cash Flow from Operations (FCFO) in the extraordinary growth period (first period), in the transaction period (second period) and in the steady-state period (third period).

By considering the extraordinary growth rate  $(g_e)$ , transitional growth rate  $(g_{tr})$  and the steady-state growth rate  $(g_n)$  and the cost of equity  $(K_A)$  in the first period  $(K_{A,eg})$ , second period  $(K_{A,tr})$  and third period  $(K_{A,st})$ , the Enterprise Value  $(W_A)$  is equal to:

$$
W _ {A} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A , e g}\right) ^ {t}} + \sum_ {t = n + 1} ^ {m} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A , t r}\right) ^ {t}} + \frac {T V _ {m}}{\left(1 + K _ {A , s t}\right) ^ {m}} \tag {9.8}
$$

where:

$$
g _ {e _ {t}} = \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{F C F O _ {t - 1}} - 1 f o r t = 1 \rightarrow t = n
$$

$$
g _ {t r _ {t}} = \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{F C F O _ {t - 1}} - 1 f o r t = n + 1 \rightarrow t = m
$$

The terminal value  $(TV_{m})$  can be computed by using the infinite growth rate model:

$$
T V _ {m} = \frac {F C F O _ {m + 1}}{K _ {A , s t} - g _ {n}} \tag {9.9}
$$

Substituting Eq. (9.9), Eq. (9.8) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
W _ {A} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A , e g}\right) ^ {t}} + \sum_ {t = n + 1} ^ {m} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A , t r}\right) ^ {t}} + \frac {\frac {F C F O _ {m + 1}}{K _ {A , s t} - g _ {n}}}{\left(1 + K _ {A , s t}\right) ^ {m}}
$$

and therefore:

$$
W _ {A} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A , e g}\right) ^ {t}} + \sum_ {t = n + 1} ^ {m} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A , t r}\right) ^ {t}} + \frac {F C F O _ {m + 1}}{\left(K _ {A , s t} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {A , s t}\right) ^ {m}} \tag {9.10}
$$

Equation (9.10) can be divided in two parts:

- The first part and second, they are the present values of the expected FCFO estimated analytically for each year in the first period ( $t = 1 \rightarrow t = n$ ) and in the second period ( $t = n + 1 \rightarrow t = m$ ). In this first period, the extraordinary growth rate ( $g_{e}$ ) can be mitigated in the second period by passing to the transitional growth rate ( $g_{tr}$ ) in the second period until it becomes stable and constant over time ( $g_{n}$ ) in the steady-state condition of the third period. Both  $g_{e}$  and  $g_{tr}$  can be changed each year compared with the previous year. Therefore, the first part and second part of the equation define the "analytical value";
- The third part is the present value of the Terminal Value estimated on the basis of a synthetic estimation of the FCFO capable of being achieved each year in perpetuity. Consequently, in this third period the steady-state growth rate  $(g_{n})$  is used, assumed constant in perpetuity. Therefore, the second part of equation defines the "syntactical value".

As discussed in the 2S-EV-DM $_{\mathrm{CC}}$  the cost of capital may be different across the three periods ( $K_{A,eg} \neq K_{A,tr} \neq K_{A,st}$ ). It is reasonable to assume that the company's capital structure changes over time until it stabilises during the last period. Therefore, the debt level changes as well as the cost of capital.

## 9.3 Free Cash Flow from Operations Discounted Model: Adjusted Present Value Approach

The Free Cash Flow from Operations Discounted Model based on the Adjusted Present Value approach  $(EV - DM_{APV})$  derived from the Arbitrage Price Theory (APT) (Myers 1974). Generally, the cost of capital approach, as discussed previously, is preferred when the debt level is stable over time. This is even more true when the WACC is used as the cost of capital. Differently, when the debt level changes over time, the Adjusted Present Value (APV) approach is more useful to estimate enterprise value (Koller at al. 2015).

The EV-DM<sub>APV</sub> estimates the Enterprise Value by distinguishing between:

- the unlevered value: it is the value of the company without debt
- the leverage net value: it is the value of the company related to the benefits and costs of debt.

Consequently, the EV-  $\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{APV}}$  estimates the Enterprise Value on three main steps (Damodaran 2012):

- the unlevered value and then the enterprise value without debt;
- the value of tax shields due to the interests on debt benefits. It is the value of advantage of debt and it is added to the unlevered value;
- the value of default risk related to the debt. It is the value of costs of debt and it is subtracted from the unlevered value.

Therefore, the Enterprise Value  $(W_A)$  is equal to the Unlevered Value  $(W_{AU})$  plus the Value of the Tax Shields  $(W_{TS})$  minus the Value of the Default Risk and Bankruptcy Costs  $(W_{DB})$  related to the debt. Formally:

$$
W _ {A} = W _ {A U} + W _ {T S} - W _ {D B} \tag {9.11}
$$

Equation (9.11) valuates the debt effects, both positive and negative, separately from the unlevered value. On the other hand, in the Cost of Capital Approach the positive and negative effects of debt are considered directly in the cost of capital used to discount FCFO.

## Unlevered Value

The first term in the model is the Unlevered Enterprise Value. It is the Enterprise Value without debt in the capital structure. The expected Free Cash Flow from Operations (FCFO) are discounted at the Unlevered Cost of Capital ( $K_{A}$ ) that is equal to the Unlevered Cost of Equity ( $K_{EU}$ ) because there is no debt:

$$
K _ {A} = K _ {E U}
$$

Therefore, the Unlevered Enterprise Value  $(W_{AU})$  is equal to:

$$
W _ {A U} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {E U}\right) ^ {t}} \tag {9.12}
$$

It is possible to use the versions (steady-state growth, two-stage growth and three-stage growth) of EV-  $\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{CC}}$  , to apply Eq. (9.12).

In the Steady-State growth scenario, the Unlevered Enterprise Value is equal to:

$$
W _ {A U} = \frac {F C F O _ {1}}{K _ {E U} - g _ {n}} \tag {9.13}
$$

In the Two-Stage growth scenario, the Unlevered Enterprise Value is equal to:

$$
W _ {A U} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {E U , e g}\right) ^ {t}} + \frac {T V _ {n}}{\left(1 + K _ {E U , s t}\right) ^ {n}}
$$

where

$$
T V _ {n} = \frac {F C F O _ {n + 1}}{K _ {E U , s t} - g _ {n}}
$$

and then:

$$
W _ {A U} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {E U , e g}\right) ^ {t}} + \frac {F C F O _ {n + 1}}{\left(K _ {E U , s t} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E U , s t}\right) ^ {n}} \tag {9.14}
$$

In the Three-Stage growth scenario, the Unlevered Enterprise Value is equal to:

$$
W _ {A U} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {E U , e g}\right) ^ {t}} + \sum_ {t = n + 1} ^ {m} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {E U , t r}\right) ^ {t}} + \frac {T V _ {m}}{\left(1 + K _ {E U , s t}\right) ^ {m}}
$$

where:

$$
T V _ {m} = \frac {F C F O _ {m + 1}}{K _ {E U , s t} - g _ {n}}
$$

And then:

$$
W _ {A U} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {E U , e g}\right) ^ {t}} + \sum_ {t = n + 1} ^ {m} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {E U , t r}\right) ^ {t}} + \frac {F C F O _ {m + 1}}{\left(K _ {E U , s t} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E U , s t}\right) ^ {m}} \tag {9.15}
$$

The most relevant difference between the Enterprise Value and the Unlevered Enterprise Value is due to the Unlevered Cost of Equity.

Specifically, the main problem is related to the determination of the beta coefficient. In an Unlevered Enterprise Value the Unlevered Beta may be considered (Hamada 1972). Specifically, the Unlevered Beta  $(\beta_{U})$  can be defined on the basis of Levered Beta  $(\beta_{L})$  that is the current beta if the capital structure is based on equity and debt, the corporate taxes  $(t_{c})$  and the Leverage equal to the ratio between debt level and equity  $(D / E)$ , as follows:

$$
\beta_ {U} = \frac {\beta_ {L}}{1 + (1 - t _ {c}) \frac {D}{E}} \tag {9.16}
$$

Therefore, the Unlevered Cost of Equity  $(K_{EU})$  can be estimated as follows:

$$
K _ {E U} = R _ {f} + \beta_ {U} \left(R _ {m} - R _ {f}\right)
$$

and then:

$$
K _ {E U} = R _ {f} + \frac {\beta_ {L}}{1 + \left(1 - t _ {c}\right) \frac {D}{E}} \left(R _ {m} - R _ {f}\right) \tag {9.17}
$$

## Value of Tax Shields

The second term in the model, is the Value of the Tax Shields. Generally, interests on debt are tax deductible. They generate a positive cash-flow due to tax savings. Therefore, they are function of corporate tax rate and the amount of the interests on debt.

It is worth noting that the tax shields can be estimated for a given debt level. Indeed, they can be estimated only if the debt level is known.

The value of the tax shields can be estimated equal to the present value of the expected cash-flow of the tax savings discounted to the appropriate rate on the basis of their risk level.

The cash-flow from tax savings  $(CF_{TS})$  can be estimated equal to the corporate taxed  $(t_c)$  multiplies interest on debt  $(I_D)$ . Specifically, interest on debt can be defined as the cost of debt  $(K_D)$  multiplied by the debt level  $(D)$ . Therefore, we have:

$$
C F _ {T S} = t _ {c} I _ {D} \rightarrow I _ {D} = K _ {D} D \rightarrow C F _ {T S} = t _ {c} K _ {D} D
$$

Denoted with  $K_{TS}$  the discount rate of the cash-flow from tax savings ( $CF_{TS}$ ), the value of the tax shields ( $W_{TS}$ ) can be estimated as follows:

$$
W _ {T S} = \frac {t _ {c} K _ {D} D}{K _ {T S}} \tag {9.18}
$$

The  $K_{TS}$  definition is the main problem of Eq. (9.18). It measures the function of the risk level of the cash-flow from tax savings. Usually, the value of this discount rate is assumed equal to the cost of debt  $(K_{D})$ . The basic reason for this relationship is that tax shields exist because there is a debt. If the company does not pay interest on debt, there are no cash-flow from tax savings. Therefore, the risk level of cash-flow from tax shields can be assumed equal to the risk level of debt. By assuming that  $K_{TS} = K_{D}$ , Eq. (9.18) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
W _ {T S} = \frac {t _ {c} K _ {D} D}{K _ {D}} = t _ {c} D \tag {9.19}
$$

## Value of Bankruptcy Costs

The third term of the model is the Value of Bankruptcy Costs in case of the company's default related to the leverage. In the case of default, the company has to bear in several bankruptcy costs, both direct and indirect. Therefore, the value of default risk is assumed equal to the bankruptcy direct and indirect costs in case of default.

It is worth noting that these costs can be measured for a given debt level. Therefore, also in this case (as for cash-flows from tax savings) the value of default risk can be estimated only if the debt level is known.

Generally, the value of bankruptcy costs  $(W_{BC})$  is estimated equal to the probability  $(\pi_D)$  of default related to the increase in debt from a given level, multiplied by the expected cash-flow related to the bankruptcy direct and indirect costs  $(CF_{BC})$ , as follows:

$$
W _ {B C} = \pi_ {D} \cdot C F _ {B C} \tag {9.20}
$$

The Eq. (9.20) is the most complex to apply because neither the probability of the company's default  $(\pi_{D})$  nor the bankruptcy costs  $(CF_{BC})$  can be estimated directly. There are two main approaches:

- the first approach estimates a bond rating and it uses the empirical estimates of default probabilities for the rating;
- the second approach uses the statistical techniques based on the company's fundamental characteristics that can be observed.

With regards to bankruptcy costs, several studies show that the direct costs are lower than indirect costs in company value. Generally, indirect costs are estimated equal to  $25\% - 30\%$  of company value (Titman 1984).

The defined Unlevered Enterprise Value  $(W_{AU})$ , Value of Tax Shields  $(W_{TS})$  and Value of Bankruptcy Costs  $(W_{BC})$ , Eq. (9.11) can be applied.

While the first part  $(W_{BC})$  can be declined in three growth scenarios, the second part  $(W_{TS})$  and the third part  $(W_{BC})$  of the equation are the same. Therefore, Eq. (9.11):

$$
W _ {A} = W _ {A U} + W _ {T S} - W _ {D B}
$$

in steady-state growth scenario, we have:

$$
W _ {A} = \frac {F C F O _ {1}}{K _ {E U} - g _ {n}} + t _ {c} D - \pi_ {D} \cdot C F _ {B C} \tag {9.21}
$$

in two-stage growth scenario, we have:

$$
W _ {A} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {E U , e g}\right) ^ {t}} + \frac {F C F O _ {n + 1}}{\left(K _ {E U , s t} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E U , s t}\right) ^ {n}} + t _ {c} D - \pi_ {D} \cdot C F _ {B C} \tag {9.22}
$$

in three-stage growth scenario, we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} W _ {A} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {E U , e g}\right) ^ {t}} + \sum_ {t = n + 1} ^ {m} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {E U , t r}\right) ^ {t}} + \frac {F C F O _ {m + 1}}{\left(K _ {E U , s t} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E U , s t}\right) ^ {m}} + t _ {c} D \\ - \pi_ {D} \cdot C F _ {B C} \tag {9.23} \\ \end{array}
$$

The relationship between the capital structure choices and the company's value can be analysed more efficiently in an APV approach rather than the cost of capital approach.

The main APV approach advantage with regards to the identification of debt effects on company value through the second and third parts. However, it is not able to define clearly how and in which measure changes in the debt level affect the default risks and the bankruptcy costs. This is the main reason why the APV approach is commonly used with a given debt level.

## 9.4 Discounted Economic Profit

The Economic Profit (EP) model (also called Economic Value Added (EVA)) is a direct measurement of the company's ability to create value. Specifically, the EPM highlights how and when the company creates value (Koller et al. 2015).

The EP is based on a simple reasoning: the company generates value if the return on investments is greater than the cost of capital invested. The positive difference between the investment returns and the cost of capital, defines the excess returns. Therefore, the excess returns measure the value creation.

Denoting with  $ER_{A}$  the excess returns of the company,  $RI_{A}$  the Return on Investments of the company, and with  $K_{A}$  the Cost of Capital (both equity and debt) of the company, we have:

$$
E R _ {A} = R I _ {A} - K _ {A} \tag {9.24}
$$

As shown by Eq. (9.24), the EPM measures the value created by the company in a single period.

Denoting with  $CIN$  the Net Capital Invested by the company,  $NOPAT$  the Net Operating Profit After Taxes (also called NOPLAT—Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes),  $ROIC$  the Return on Invested Capital, and  $K_A$  the Cost of Capital of the company, Eq. (9.24) can be applied to estimate Economic Profit (EP) as follows (Koller et al. 2015):

$$
E P = C I N \cdot \left(R O I C - K _ {A}\right)
$$

Considering that:

$$
R O I C = \frac {N O P A T}{C I N}
$$

and substituting, we have:

$$
E P = C I N \cdot \left(\frac {N O P A T}{C I N} - K _ {A}\right)
$$

and then:

$$
E P = N O P A T - K _ {A} \cdot C I N \tag {9.25}
$$

Equation (9.25) measures the value created by the firm in a single period. It is possible to estimate the Enterprise Value  $(W_A)$  by using the Discounted Economic Profit (DEP) as follows:

$$
W _ {A _ {(t = 0)}} = C I N _ {(t = 0)} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {E P _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}} \tag {9.26}
$$

In order to apply Eq. (9.26), the analytical and synthetic valuation can be distinguished, as follows:

$$
W _ {A _ {(t = 0)}} = C I N _ {(t = 0)} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {E P _ {t}}{(1 + K _ {A}) ^ {t}} + \frac {P V (E P _ {n})}{(1 + K _ {A}) ^ {n}}
$$

where  $PV(EP_{n})$  is the Present Value of the Economic Profit at the end of the analytical period ( $t = n$ ). Considering the steady-state growth rate ( $g_{n}$ ), it can be estimated as follows:

$$
P V \left(E P _ {n}\right) = \frac {E P _ {n + 1}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}
$$

and substituting, we have:

$$
W _ {A _ {(t = 0)}} = C I N _ {(t = 0)} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {E P _ {t}}{(1 + K _ {A}) ^ {t}} + \frac {\frac {E P _ {n + 1}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}}{(1 + K _ {A}) ^ {n}}
$$

and then:

$$
W _ {A _ {(t = 0)}} = C I N _ {(t = 0)} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {E P _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}} + \frac {E P _ {n + 1}}{\left(K _ {A} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {n}} \tag {9.27}
$$

Equation (9.27) shows how the Discounted Economic Profit is based on three terms:

- the net capital invested in the assets in place;  $(t = 0)$
- the present value of the expected Economic Profit in analytical period  $(t = 1 \rightarrow n)$ ;
- the present value of the expected Economic Profit in steady-state condition  $(t = n\to \infty)$ .

The use of DEP to evaluate the Enterprise Value is also due to compatibility between two models. Indeed, the DEP can be considered equivalent, under defined assumptions, to the Enterprise Discounted Cash-Flow (EV-DM). It can be demonstrated as follows (Koller et al. 2015).

Considering the following baseline relationships:

(1) Net Investment (NI) can be defined as the increase in Net Capital Invested (NCI) in the core-business of the company as follows:

$$
N I = \Delta N C I = N C I _ {t + 1} - N C I _ {t}
$$

(2) Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) can be defined as the ratio between the NOPAT and the Net Capital Invested as follows:

$$
R O I C = \frac {N O P A T}{N C I} \rightarrow \left\{\begin{array}{l}N O P A T = R O I C \cdot N C I\\N C I = \frac {N O P A T}{R O I C}\end{array}\right.
$$

(3) Investment Rate (IR) can be defined as a portion of the NOPAT invested back into the core-business. Consequently, it can be estimated equal to the ratio between Net Investment (NI) and NOPAT as follows:

$$
I R = \frac {N I}{N O P A T} \rightarrow \left\{\begin{array}{l}N I = I R \cdot N O P A T\\N O P A T = \frac {N I}{I R}\end{array}\right.
$$

(4) The growth rate  $(g)$  can be estimated on the basis of ROIC and IR as follows:

$$
g = R O I C \cdot I R \to \left\{ \begin{array}{l} I R = \frac {g}{R O I C} \\ R O I C = \frac {g}{I R} \end{array} \right.
$$

(5) Net Investment (NI) in core-business is the capital invested in Capex plus Net Working Capital (NWC) less Provisions (Pro). If the Operating Taxes (OT) are considered, then the NOPAT can be considered rather than EBITDA  $(\mathrm{NOPAT} = \mathrm{EBITDA - OT})$ . In this case, the Free Cash Flow From Operations (FCFO) can be defined as follows:

$$
F C F O = E B I T D A - O T + \Delta C a p e x + \Delta N W C - P r o
$$

$$
E B I T D A - O T = N O P A T; \Delta C a p e x + \Delta N W C - P r o = \Delta N C I = N C I _ {t + 1} - N C I _ {t} = N I
$$

$$
F C F O = N O P A T - N I \leftrightarrow F C F O = N O P A T - \left(N C I _ {t + 1} - N C I _ {t}\right)
$$

This relationship can be rewritten on the basis of the relationship n.3, as follows:

$$
F C F O = N O P A T - (N O P A T \cdot I R) = N O P A T \cdot (1 - I R)
$$

and on the basis of relationship n.4, as follows:

$$
F C F O = N O P A T \cdot \left(1 - \frac {g}{R O I C}\right)
$$

Now consider the Enterprise Value Discounted Model in the version of constant growth rate (one-period growth):

$$
W _ {A} = \frac {F C F O _ {(1)}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}
$$

The FCFO's are constant over time if all variables are constant. Therefore, the FCFO in the next period  $FCFO_{(1)}$  can be defined on the basis of a constant growth rate  $(g_{n})$ , cost of capital  $(K_{A})$ , and ROIC as follows:

$$
F C F O _ {(1)} = N O P A T _ {(1)} \cdot \left(1 - \frac {g _ {n}}{R O I C}\right)
$$

and by substituting we have:

$$
W _ {A} = \frac {N O P A T _ {(1)} \cdot \left(1 - \frac {g _ {n}}{R O I C}\right)}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}
$$

On the basis of the relationship n.2, we have:

$$
N O P A T _ {(1)} = N C I _ {(0)} \cdot R O I C
$$

and substituting, we have:

$$
W _ {A} = \frac {N C I _ {(0)} \cdot R O I C \cdot \left(1 - \frac {g _ {n}}{R O I C}\right)}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}
$$

and by considering that the ROIC is constant over time, we have:

$$
W _ {A} = N C I _ {(0)} \cdot \left(\frac {R O I C - g _ {n}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}\right) \tag {9.28}
$$

Equation (9.28) is useful to show the value drivers. Indeed, the Enterprise Value is a function of growth rate, ROIC and the cost of capital. This equation is not used in practice because it assumes a constant value of growth rate  $(g_{n})$ , ROIC and the cost of capital in perpetuity.

Note that Eq. (9.28) can be transformed into a multiple Value-to-Invested Capital by dividing both terms by Net Capital Invested (NCI), as follows:

$$
\frac {W _ {A}}{N C I _ {(0)}} = \frac {R O I C - g _ {n}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}} \tag {9.29}
$$

In Eq. (9.29) all variables  $(ROIC, K_A, g_n)$  are constant over time.

Now it is possible to rewrite Eq. (9.28) in a formula on Economic Profit (Koller et al. 2015). To do this it is necessary to demonstrate that the Enterprise Value Discounted Cash-Flow model is equivalent to the current book value of capital invested plus the present value of future economic profits. Proof can be achieved by considering the version of one-period growth as follows.

$$
W _ {A} = \frac {F C F O _ {1}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}} \rightarrow W _ {A} = \frac {N O P A T _ {(1)} \cdot \left(1 - \frac {g _ {n}}{R O I C}\right)}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}} \rightarrow W _ {A} = N C I _ {(0)} \cdot \left(\frac {R O I C - g _ {n}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}\right)
$$

By subtracting and adding the Cost of Capital  $(K_{A})$  in the numerator, we have:

$$
W _ {A} = N C I _ {(0)} \cdot \left(\frac {R O I C - K _ {A} + K _ {A} - g _ {n}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}\right)
$$

and separating the fraction in two terms, we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} W _ {A} = N C I _ {(0)} \cdot \left(\frac {R O I C - K _ {A}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}\right) + N C I _ {(0)} \cdot \left(\frac {K _ {A} - g _ {n}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}\right) \\ = N C I _ {(0)} + N C I _ {(0)} \cdot \left(\frac {R O I C - K _ {A}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

and by considering that:

$$
N C I _ {(0)} \cdot \left(R O I C - K _ {A}\right) = E c o n o m i c P r o f i t (E P)
$$

substituting, we have:

$$
W _ {A} = N C I _ {(0)} + \frac {E P _ {(1)}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}} \tag {9.30}
$$

Equation (9.30) shows how the Enterprise Value is equal to the book value of capital invested  $\left(NC I_{(0)}\right)$  plus the present value of the future economic profit  $\left(E P_{(1)}\right)$ . Note that the second term of the equation, is the one-period growth of the Discounted Cash-Flow models. Finally, note that:

- if the future economic profits are expected to be zero  $\left(EP_{(1)} = 0\right)$ , the Enterprise Value is equal to the book value of capital invested. Consequently, the intrinsic value of the Enterprise is equal to the book value;
- if the future economic profits are expected less than zero  $(EP_{(1)} < 0)$ , the investments destroy value and then the Enterprise Value is less than its book value.

Equation (9.30) can be generalized (Koller et al. 2015). In general terms, we have:

$$
W _ {A} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}}
$$

Add and subtract the cumulative sum of Net Capital Invested  $\left(\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{N C I_{t}}{(1 + K_{A})^{t}}\right)$  as follows:

$$
W _ {A} = \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \frac {N C I _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}} - \sum_ {t = 0} ^ {\infty} \frac {N C I _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}}
$$

By considering the starting point  $t = 0$ , the first cumulative sum becomes  $\left(NC_{I_{(0)}} + \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{NC_{I_t}}{(1 + K_A)^t}\right)$  while the second starts from  $t = 1$  to infinity and then it changes each  $t$  inside in the second cumulative sum to  $t - 1 \left(\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{NC_{I_{t-1}}}{(1 + K_A)^{t-1}}\right)$ , as follows:

$$
W _ {A} = N C I _ {(0)} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {N C I _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}} - \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {N C I _ {t - 1}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t - 1}} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}}
$$

Multiply and divide the third term by  $\frac{1 + K_A}{1 + K_A}$  as follows:

$$
\sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {N C I _ {t - 1} (1 + K _ {A})}{(1 + K _ {A}) ^ {t - 1} (1 + K _ {A})} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {N C I _ {t - 1} (1 + K _ {A})}{(1 + K _ {A}) ^ {t - 1 + 1}} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {N C I _ {t - 1} (1 + K _ {A})}{(1 + K _ {A}) ^ {t}}
$$

and then, we have:

$$
W _ {A} = N C I _ {(0)} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {N C I _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}} - \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {N C I _ {t - 1} \left(1 + K _ {A}\right)}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}}
$$

and:

$$
W _ {A} = N C I _ {(0)} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {N C I _ {t} - N C I _ {t - 1} (1 + K _ {A}) + F C F O _ {t}}{(1 + K _ {A}) ^ {t}}
$$

and:

$$
W _ {A} = N C I _ {(0)} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {N C I _ {t} - N C I _ {t - 1} - N C I _ {t - 1} \cdot K _ {A} + F C F O _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}}
$$

On the basis of relationship n.5, we have:

$$
F C F O = N O P A T - \left(N C I _ {t} - N C I _ {t - 1}\right)
$$

and substituting, we have:

$$
W _ {A} = N C I _ {(0)} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {N C I _ {t} - N C I _ {t - 1} - N C I _ {t - 1} \cdot K _ {A} + N O P A T _ {t} - \left(N C I _ {t} - N C I _ {t - 1}\right)}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}}
$$

and:

$$
W _ {A} = N C I _ {(0)} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {N C I _ {t} - N C I _ {t - 1} - N C I _ {t - 1} \cdot K _ {A} + N O P A T _ {t} - N C I _ {t} + N C I _ {t - 1}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}}
$$

and:

$$
W _ {A} = N C I _ {(0)} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {N O P A T _ {t} - N C I _ {t - 1} \cdot K _ {A}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}}
$$

Considering that:

$$
E c o n o m i c P r o f i t (E P) = N O P A T _ {t} - N C I _ {t - 1} \cdot K _ {A}
$$

substituting, we have:

$$
W _ {A} = N C I _ {(0)} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {E P _ {t}}{\left(1 + K _ {A}\right) ^ {t}} \tag {9.31}
$$

Equation (9.31) shows that the Enterprise Value is equal to the book value of Capital Invested  $\left(NCI_{(0)}\right)$  plus the present value of all future economic profits  $\left(\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\frac{EP_t}{(1 + K_A)^t}\right)$ . Equation (9.31) is the generalization of Eq. (9.30) and then:

- if the future economic profits are expected to be zero  $\left(\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{EP_t}{(1 + K_A)^t} = 0\right)$ , the Enterprise Value is equal to the book value of capital invested. Consequently, the intrinsic value of the Enterprise is equal to the book value;
- if the future economic profits are expected less than zero  $\left(\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{EP_t}{(1 + K_A)^t} < 0\right)$ , the investments destroy value and then the Enterprise Value is less than its book value.

The equivalence between Discounted Economic Profit and the Enterprise Value Discounted Cash-Flows, as shown by Eqs. (9.30), (9.31), requires defined assumptions (Koller et al. 2015):

- use beginning-of-year invested capital instead of average or current-year invested capital;
define invested capital for both economic profit and ROIC using the same value;
- use a constant cost of capital as discount rate.

Finally, note that also in this case by using the EPM it is possible to move from the Enterprise Value  $(W_A)$  to Equity Value  $(W_E)$ . In this case, it is necessary to subtract the Enterprise Value from the Net Financial Position (NFP) as follows:

$$
W _ {E} = W _ {A} - P F N \tag {9.32}
$$

and by considering Eq. (9.30), we have:

$$
W _ {E _ {(t = 0)}} = \left[ N C I _ {(0)} + \frac {E P _ {(1)}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}} \right] - P F N _ {(t = 0)} \tag {9.33}
$$

and by considering Eq. (9.31), we have:

$$
W _ {E _ {(t = 0)}} = \left[ N C I _ {(0)} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {E P _ {t}}{(1 + K _ {A}) ^ {t}} \right] - P F N _ {(t = 0)} \tag {9.34}
$$

and by considering Eq. (9.27), we have:

$$
W _ {E _ {(t = 0)}} = \left[ C I N _ {(t = 0)} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {n} \frac {E P _ {t}}{(1 + K _ {A}) ^ {t}} + \frac {E P _ {n + 1}}{(K _ {A} - g _ {n}) (1 + K _ {A}) ^ {n}} \right] - P F N _ {(t = 0)} \tag {9.35}
$$

## 9.5 Multiplies on Enterprise Value

The relative valuation to estimate the Enterprise Value can be achieved on the basis of several multiples. Among these there are three most relevant ones in the financial approach:

(a) Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio;
(b) Enterprise Value-to-Book Value (EV/BV) ratio;
(c) Enterprise Value-to-Sales (EV/S) ratio;

### Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA

The multiple Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio is one of the most commonly used to estimate the Enterprise Value. The main advantages of this multiple refer to the use of EBITDA. Indeed:

- the EBITDA is always positive. Its negative value identifies an anomalous condition of the company;
- the EBITDA has a direct impact on Free Cash Flow and then on the financial dynamic of the company;
- the EBITDA does not consider the depreciation and amortization process. Therefore, it allows for the comparison of companies with different level of investments;
- the EBITDA does not consider the effects of the leverage. Therefore, it allows for the comparison of companies with different capital structures.

The Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA is equal to the ratio between Enterprise Value (EV) and the EBITDA as follows:

$$
E V / E B I T D A = \frac {E V}{E B I T D A} \tag {9.36}
$$

A relationship can be defined between the company's fundamentals and the multiple. This relationship can be analysed on the basis of the Free Cash-Flow from Operations Discounted Model in the version of Cost of Capital (EV-DM<sub>CC</sub>). Specifically, this relationship can be defined in two scenarios (Damodaran 2012):

- steady-state growth over time scenario;
- two-stage growth scenario: extraordinary growth in the first period and steady-state growth in the second period.

In the steady-state growth over time scenario, the Enterprise Value  $(W_{A})$  can be estimated on the basis of EV-  $\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{CC}}$  as follows:

$$
W _ {A} = \frac {F C F O}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}
$$

where  $FCFO$  are the Free Cash-Flow from Operations that the company can achieve in perpetuity in steady-state scenario and  $g_{n}$  is the steady-state growth rate.

By estimating the Enterprise Value with multiple EV/EBITDA, we have:

$$
W _ {A} \equiv E V
$$

Remembering that Free Cash Flow from Operations (FCFO) is equal to EBITDA, plus/(minus) changes in Net Capex ( $\Delta$ Capex), plus/(minus) changes in Net Working Capital ( $\Delta$ NWC), minus cash-out due to negative changes in Provisions ( $\Delta P$ ), we have:

$$
F C F O = E B I T D A \pm \Delta C a p e x \pm \Delta N W C - \Delta P
$$

and substituting, we have:

$$
W _ {A} \equiv E V = \frac {E B I T D A \pm \Delta C a p e x \pm \Delta N W C - \Delta P}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}
$$

By dividing both terms by EBITDA, we have:

$$
\frac {E V}{E B I T D A} = \frac {E B I T D A \pm \Delta C a p e x \pm \Delta N W C - \Delta P}{E B I T D A \left(K _ {A} - g _ {n}\right)}
$$

and then:

$$
\frac {E V}{E B I T D A} = \frac {1}{\left(K _ {A} - g _ {n}\right)} \left[ 1 + \frac {1}{E B I T D A} (\pm \Delta C a p e x \pm \Delta N W C - \Delta P) \right] \tag {9.37}
$$

Equation (9.37) defines the relationship between the multiple  $EV/EBITDA$  and the company's fundamentals. Specifically, the equation shows as the multiple is affected by (Damodaran 2012):

- Depreciation and Amortization process: if the company derives a greater portion of its EBITDA from depreciation and amortization it should trade at lower multiples of EBITDA than similar companies;
- Net Capex and Net Working Capital: the greater the portion of the EBITDA that needs to be reinvested in the company to generate expected future growth, the lower multiple of EBITDA;
- Cost of Capital: a company with lower cost of capital should trade at much higher multiples of EBITDA;
- Steady-state growth rate: the higher the steady-state growth rate, higher the multiplies of EBITDA.

The EBIT can be used instead of the EBITDA. In this case the multiple becomes EV-to-EBITDA and Eq. (9.36) can be rewritten as follows:

$$
EV/EBIT = \frac{EV}{EBIT} \tag{9.38}
$$

In this case, the relationship between the multiple  $EV/EBIT$  and the company's fundamentals defined in Eq. (9.37) does not change. Indeed, in cash-flow perspective the EBIT is equal to the EBITDA.

In the two-stage growth scenario (extraordinary growth in the first period and steady-state growth in the second period) the Enterprise Value  $(W_{A})$  can be estimated on the basis of 2S-EVDM $_{\mathrm{CC}}$  as follows:

$$
W _ {A} = \frac {F C F O (1 + g _ {e}) \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 + g _ {e}) ^ {n}}{(1 + K _ {E , e g}) ^ {n}} \right]}{K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}} + \frac {F C F O (1 + g _ {e}) ^ {n} (1 + g _ {n})}{\left(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E , s g}\right) ^ {n}}
$$

where  $g_{e}$  is the growth rate in the extraordinary growth period (first period) and  $g_{n}$  is the growth rate in the steady-state period (second period).

By considering that:

$$
W _ {A} \equiv E V
$$

and:

$$
FCFO = EBITDA \pm \Delta Capex \pm \Delta NWC - \Delta P
$$

Substituting, we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} EV = \frac {[EBITDA \pm \Delta Capex \pm \Delta NWC - \Delta P] (1 + g_{e}) [1 - \frac {(1 + g_{e})^{n}}{(1 + K_{E,eg})^{n}} ]}{K_{E,eg} - g_{e}} \\ + \frac {[EBITDA \pm \Delta Capex \pm \Delta NWC - \Delta P] (1 + g_{e})^{n} (1 + g_{n})}{(K_{E,sg} - g_{n}) (1 + K_{E,sg})^{n}} \\ \end{array}
$$

and then:

$$
\begin{array}{l} E V = \left[ E B I T D A \pm \Delta C a p e x \pm \Delta N W C - \Delta P \right] \left[ \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n}}{\left(1 + K _ {E , e g}\right) ^ {n}} \right]}{K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}} \right. \\ \left. + \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n} \left(1 + g _ {n}\right)}{\left(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E , s g}\right) ^ {n}} \right] \\ \end{array}
$$

And dividing both terms of equation by EBITDA, we have:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {E V}{E B I T D A} = \left[ 1 + \frac {1}{E B I T D A} \left(\pm \Delta C a p e x \pm \Delta N W C - \Delta P\right) \right] \left[ \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n}}{\left(1 + K _ {E , e g}\right) ^ {n}} \right]}{K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}} \right. \\ \left. + \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n} \left(1 + g _ {n}\right)}{\left(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E , s g}\right) ^ {n}} \right] \tag {9.39} \\ \end{array}
$$

Equation (9.39) shows the relationship between the multiple  $EV/EBITDA$  and the company's fundamentals in the two-stage growth scenario.

### Value-to-Book Value

The multiple Enterprise Value-to-Book (EV/BV) ratio estimates the Enterprise Value on the basis of the market value and book value. Specifically, the multiple is equal to the ratio between the Enterprise Value (EV) and the book value of equity and debt  $(BV)$ , as follows:

$$
E V B V = \frac {E V}{B V} \tag {9.40}
$$

Therefore, it is similar to the multiple Price-to-Book (PBV).

A relationship between the company's fundamentals and the multiple can be defined. This relationship can be analysed on the basis of the Free Cash-Flow from Operations Discounted Model in the version of Cost of Capital (EV-DM<sub>CC</sub>). Specifically, this relationship can be defined in two scenarios (Damodaran 2012):

- steady-state growth over time scenario;
- two-stage growth scenario: extraordinary growth in the first period and steady-state growth in the second period.

In steady-state growth over time scenario, the Enterprise Value  $(W_{A})$  can be estimated on the basis the basis of EV-DM $_{\mathrm{CC}}$  as follows:

## 9.5 Multiplies on Enterprise Value

$$
W _ {A} = \frac {F C F O}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}
$$

where  $FCFO$  are the Free Cash-Flow from Operations that the company can achieve in perpetuity in steady-state scenario and  $g_{n}$  is the steady-state growth rate. Also in this case, we have:

$$
W _ {A} \equiv E V
$$

Assuming that a cash-flow needs to be invested in Capex, Net Working Capital and Provisions is a part of EBITDA, the FCFO can be expressed in terms of EBITDA and Reinvestment Rate (RR) as follows:

$$
F C F O = E B I T D A (1 - R R)
$$

Substituting, we have:

$$
E V = \frac {E B I T D A (1 - R R)}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}
$$

Dividing both terms by the Book Value of the Capital Invested, we have:

$$
\frac {E V}{B V} = \frac {E B I T D A (1 - R R)}{B V \left(K _ {A} - g _ {n}\right)}
$$

$$
\frac {E V}{B V} = \frac {E B I T D A (1 - R R)}{B V \left(K _ {A} - g _ {n}\right)} \tag {9.41}
$$

Equation (9.41) shows the relationship between the multiple and company fundamentals. This equation can be further developed.

The Book Value of Equity and Debt defines the Capital Structure (CS) of the company. By definition it must be equal to the Capital Invested (CI). By assuming that the entire capital is invested in core-business of the firm, we have:

$$
R O I = \frac {E B I T D A}{B V}
$$

And substituting, we have:

$$
\frac {E V}{B V} = \frac {R O I (1 - R R)}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}
$$

In a steady-state growth scenario, the Reinvestment Rate (RR) is equal to the ratio between the steady-state growth rate  $(g_{n})$  and ROI. Indeed, it is the requirement of the reinvestment to increase the ROI by following the growth rate:

$$
g _ {n} = R R \cdot R O I \rightarrow R R = \frac {g _ {n}}{R O I}
$$

and substituting, we have:

$$
\frac {E V}{B V} = \frac {R O I \left(1 - \frac {g _ {n}}{R O I}\right)}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}
$$

And then:

$$
\frac {E V}{B V} = \frac {R O I - g _ {n}}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}} \tag {9.42}
$$

Equation (9.42) defines further the relationship between the multiple  $EV / BV$  and the company's fundamentals.

In the two-stage growth scenario (extraordinary growth in the first period and steady-state growth in the second period) the Enterprise Value  $(W_{A})$  can be estimated on the basis of 2S-EVDM $_{\mathrm{CC}}$  as follows:

$$
W _ {A} = \frac {F C F O (1 + g _ {e}) \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 + g _ {e}) ^ {n}}{(1 + K _ {E , e g}) ^ {n}} \right]}{K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}} + \frac {F C F O (1 + g _ {e}) ^ {n} (1 + g _ {n})}{\left(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E , s g}\right) ^ {n}}
$$

By considering that:

$$
W _ {A} \equiv E V
$$

and:

$$
F C F O = E B I T D A (1 - R R)
$$

Substituting, we have:

$$
E V = \frac {E B I T D A (1 - R R) (1 + g _ {e}) \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n}}{\left(1 + K _ {E , e g}\right) ^ {n}} \right]}{K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}} + \frac {E B I T D A (1 - R R) \left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n} \left(1 + g _ {n}\right)}{\left(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E , s g}\right) ^ {n}}
$$

and then:

## 9.5 Multiplies on Enterprise Value

$$
E V = E B I T D A (1 - R R) \left\{\frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n}}{\left(1 + K _ {E , e g}\right) ^ {n}} \right]}{K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}} + \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n} \left(1 + g _ {n}\right)}{\left(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E , s g}\right) ^ {n}} \right\}
$$

By dividing both terms by the Book Value of the Capital Invested, we have:

$$
\frac {E V}{B V} = \frac {E B I T D A (1 - R R)}{B V} \left\{\frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n}}{\left(1 + K _ {E , e g}\right) ^ {n}} \right]}{K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}} + \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n} \left(1 + g _ {n}\right)}{\left(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E , s g}\right) ^ {n}} \right\} \tag {9.43}
$$

Equation (9.43) shows the relationship between the multiple  $EV / BV$  and company's fundamentals. This equation can be further developed (Damodaran 2012).

The Book Value of Equity and Debt defines the Capital Structure (CS) of the company. By definition it must be equal to the Capital Invested (CI). By assuming that the entire capital is invested in the core business of the company, we have:

$$
R O I = \frac {E B I T D A}{B V}
$$

And substituting, we have:

$$
\frac {E V}{B V} = R O I (1 - R R) \left\{\frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n}}{\left(1 + K _ {E , e g}\right) ^ {n}} \right]}{K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}} + \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n} \left(1 + g _ {n}\right)}{\left(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E , s g}\right) ^ {n}} \right\}
$$

By considering that the reinvestment rate (RR) must be equal to the growth rate  $(g_{e})$  to achieve the ROI, we have:

$$
g _ {e} = R R \cdot R O I \rightarrow R R = \frac {g _ {e}}{R O I}
$$

Therefore, by substituting we have:

$$
\frac {E V}{B V} = R O I \left(1 - \frac {g _ {e}}{R O I}\right) \left\{\frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n}}{\left(1 + K _ {E , e g}\right) ^ {n}} \right]}{K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}} + \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n} \left(1 + g _ {n}\right)}{\left(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E , s g}\right) ^ {n}} \right\}
$$

and then:

$$
\frac {E V}{B V} = \left(R O I - g _ {e}\right) \left\{\frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n}}{\left(1 + K _ {E , e g}\right) ^ {n}} \right]}{K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}} + \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n} \left(1 + g _ {n}\right)}{\left(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E , s g}\right) ^ {n}} \right\} \tag {9.44}
$$

Equation (9.44) is a further relationship between the multiple  $EV / BV$  and company's fundamentals.

### Enterprise Value-to-Sales

The multiple Value-to-Sales (EV/S or EVS) ratio is calculated based on the value of the operating assets to revenues. Specifically, it is equal to the ratio between Enterprise Value (EV) and Sales Revenues (S) as follows:

$$
E V S = \frac {\text {E n t e r p r i s e V a l u e} (E V)}{\text {S a l e s}} \tag {9.45}
$$

Also in this case, it is possible to define a relationship between the company's fundamentals and the multiple. This relationship can be analysed on the basis of the Free Cash-Flow from Operations Discounted Model in the version of Cost of Capital (EV-DM<sub>CC</sub>). Specifically, this relationship can be defined in two scenarios (Damodaran 2012):

- steady-state growth over time scenario;
- two-stage growth scenario: extraordinary growth in the first period and steady-state growth in the second period.

In the steady-state growth over time scenario, the Enterprise Value  $(W_{A})$  can be estimated on the basis the basis of EV-  $\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{CC}}$  as follows:

$$
W _ {A} = \frac {F C F O}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}
$$

where  $FCFO$ 's are the Free Cash-Flow from Operations that the company can achieve in perpetuity in steady-state scenario and  $g_{n}$  is the steady-state growth rate.

By considering that:

$$
W _ {A} \equiv E V
$$

And by considering the to define the FCFO based on EBITDA and Retention Rate (RR), we have:

$$
F C F O = E B I T D A (1 - R R)
$$

Substituting, we have:

## 9.5 Multiplies on Enterprise Value

$$
W _ {A} \equiv E V = \frac {E B I T D A (1 - R R)}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}}
$$

Dividing both terms by the Sales Revenues (S), we have:

$$
\frac {E V}{S} = \frac {E B I T D A (1 - R R)}{S \left(K _ {A} - g _ {n}\right)}
$$

The ratio between EBITDA and Revenues Sales defines the Operating Margin (OM):

$$
O M = \frac {E B I T D A}{S}
$$

and substituting, we have:

$$
\frac {E V}{S} = O M \frac {(1 - R R)}{K _ {A} - g _ {n}} \tag {9.46}
$$

Equation (9.46) defines the relationship between the  $EV / S$  multiple and the company's fundamentals in the steady-state growth scenario.

In the two-stage growth scenario (extraordinary growth in the first period and steady-state growth in the second period) the Enterprise Value  $(W_{A})$  can be estimated on the basis of 2S-EVDM $_{\mathrm{CC}}$  as follows:

$$
W _ {A} = \frac {F C F O (1 + g _ {e}) \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 + g _ {e}) ^ {n}}{(1 + K _ {E , e g}) ^ {n}} \right]}{K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}} + \frac {F C F O (1 + g _ {e}) ^ {n} (1 + g _ {n})}{\left(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E , s g}\right) ^ {n}}
$$

By considering that:

$$
W _ {A} \equiv E V
$$

and:

$$
F C F O = E B I T D A (1 - R R)
$$

Substituting, we have:

$$
E V = \frac {E B I T D A (1 - R R) \left(1 + g _ {e}\right) \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n}}{\left(1 + K _ {E , e g}\right) ^ {n}} \right]}{K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}} + \frac {E B I T D A (1 - R R) \left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n} \left(1 + g _ {n}\right)}{\left(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E , s g}\right) ^ {n}}
$$

Dividing both terms by Revenues Sales (S), we have:

$$
\frac {E V}{S} = \frac {E B I T D A (1 - R R) (1 + g _ {e}) \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 + g _ {e}) ^ {n}}{(1 + K _ {E , e g}) ^ {n}} \right]}{S \left(K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}\right)} + \frac {E B I T D A (1 - R R) (1 + g _ {e}) ^ {n} (1 + g _ {n})}{S \left(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E , s g}\right) ^ {n}}
$$

and then:

$$
\frac {E V}{S} = \frac {E B I T D A}{S} (1 - R R) \left\{\frac {(1 + g _ {e}) \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 + g _ {e}) ^ {n}}{(1 + K _ {E , e g}) ^ {n}} \right]}{K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}} + \frac {(1 + g _ {e}) ^ {n} (1 + g _ {n})}{(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}) (1 + K _ {E , s g}) ^ {n}} \right\}
$$

Remembering that Operating Margin is equal to:

$$
O M = \frac {E B I T D A}{S}
$$

and substituting, we have:

$$
\frac {E V}{S} = O M (1 - R R) \left\{\frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) \left[ 1 - \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n}}{\left(1 + K _ {E , e g}\right) ^ {n}} \right]}{K _ {E , e g} - g _ {e}} + \frac {\left(1 + g _ {e}\right) ^ {n} \left(1 + g _ {n}\right)}{\left(K _ {E , s g} - g _ {n}\right) \left(1 + K _ {E , s g}\right) ^ {n}} \right\} \tag {9.47}
$$

Equation (9.47) shows the relationship between the  $EV / S$  multiple and the company's fundamentals in the two-stage growth scenario.
