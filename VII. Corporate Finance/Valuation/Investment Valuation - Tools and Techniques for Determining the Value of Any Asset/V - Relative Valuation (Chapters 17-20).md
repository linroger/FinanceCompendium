# Fundamental Principles of Relative Valuation

In discounted cash flow valuation, the objective is to find the value of assets, given their cash flow, growth, and risk characteristics. In relative valuation, the objective is to value assets based on how similar assets are currently priced in the market. While multiples are easy to use and intuitive, they are also easy to misuse. Consequently, a series of tests are developed in this chapter that can be used to check that multiples are correctly used.

There are two components to relative valuation. The first is that, to value assets on a relative basis, prices have to be standardized, usually by converting prices into multiples of earnings, book values, or sales. The second is to find similar firms, which is difficult to do since no two firms are identical and firms in the same business can still differ on risk, growth potential, and cash flows. The question of how to control for these differences, when comparing pricing across several firms, becomes a key one.

# USE OF RELATIVE VALUATION

The use of relative valuation is widespread. Most equity research reports and many acquisition valuations are based on a comparison of a company to comparable firms, using a multiple such as PE as the basis. In fact, firms in the same business as the firm being valued are called comparable, though, as you will see later in this chapter, that is not always true. In this section, the reasons for the popularity of relative valuation are considered first, followed by some potential pitfalls.

# Reasons for Popularity

There are several reasons why relative valuation is so widely used. First, a valuation based on a multiple and comparable firms can be completed with far fewer explicit assumptions and far more quickly than a discounted cash flow valuation. Second, a relative valuation is simpler to understand and easier to present to clients and customers than a discounted cash flow valuation. Put differently, it is far easier to frame an asset as cheap or expensive using a multiple rather than a discounted cash flow valuation. Finally, a relative valuation is much more likely to reflect the current mood of the market, since it is an attempt to measure relative and not intrinsic value. Thus, in a market where all social media stocks see their prices bid up, relative valuation is likely to yield higher values for these stocks than discounted cash flow valuations. In fact, relative valuations will generally yield values that are closer to the market price than discounted cash flow valuations for all companies. This is particularly important for those whose job it is to make judgments on relative value, and who are themselves judged on a relative basis. Consider, for instance, managers of growth mutual funds. These managers will be judged based on how their funds do relative to other growth funds. Consequently, they will be rewarded if they pick growth stocks that are undervalued relative to other growth stocks, even if all growth stocks are overvalued.

# Potential Pitfalls

The strengths of relative valuation are also its weaknesses. First, the ease with which a relative valuation can be put together, pulling together a multiple and a group of comparable firms, can also result in inconsistent estimates of value where key variables such as risk, growth, or cash flow potential are ignored. Second, the fact that multiples reflect the market mood also implies that using relative valuation to estimate the value of an asset can result in values that are too high when the market is overvaluing comparable firms, or too low when it is undervaluing these firms. Third, while there is scope for bias in any type of valuation, the lack of transparency regarding the underlying assumptions in relative valuations makes them particularly vulnerable to manipulation. A biased analyst who is allowed to choose the multiple on which the valuation is based and to pick the comparable firms can essentially ensure that almost any value can be justified.

# STANDARDIZED VALUES AND MULTIPLES

The price of a stock is a function of both the value of the equity in a company and the number of shares outstanding in the firm. Thus, a 2-for-1 stock split that doubles the number of units will approximately halve the stock price. Since stock prices are determined by the number of units of equity in a firm, stock prices cannot be compared across different firms. To compare the values of similar firms in the market, you need to standardize the values in some way. Values for businesses can be standardized relative to the earnings generated, to the book value or replacement value of the assets employed, to the revenues generated, or to measures that are specific to firms in a sector.

# Earnings Multiples

One of the more intuitive ways to think of the value of any asset is as a multiple of the earnings that asset generates. When buying a stock, it is common to look at the price paid as a multiple of the earnings per share generated by the company. The earnings per share themselves can be estimated before or after extraordinary items and can reflect what the company earned in prior periods or a future period.

When buying a business, as opposed to just the equity in the business, it is common to examine the value of the operating assets of the firm (also called enterprise value) as a multiple of the operating income or the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). While, for a buyer of the equity or the operating assets, a lower multiple is better than a higher one, these multiples will be affected by the growth potential and risk of the business being acquired.

# Book Value or Replacement Value Multiples

While markets provide one estimate of the value of a business, accountants often provide a very different estimate of the same business. The accounting estimate of book value is determined by accounting rules and is heavily influenced by the original price paid for assets and any accounting adjustments (such as depreciation) made since. Investors often look at the relationship between the price they pay for a stock and the book value of equity (or net worth) as a measure of how overor undervalued a stock is; the price-book value (PBV) ratio that emerges can vary widely across industries, depending again on the growth potential and the quality of the investments in each. When valuing businesses, you estimate this ratio using the enterprise value relative to the book value of all invested capital (rather than just the equity). For those who believe that book value is not a good measure of the true value of the assets, an alternative is to use the replacement cost of the assets; the ratio of the value of the firm to replacement cost is called Tobin's Q, discussed in Chapter 19.

# Revenue Multiples

Both earnings and book value are accounting measures and are determined by accounting rules and principles. An alternative measure, which is far less affected by accounting choices, is revenue, and you can scale either equity or enterprise value to it. For equity investors, this ratio is the price-sales (PS) ratio, where the market value of equity is divided by the revenues. For enterprise value, this ratio can be modified as the value-sales (VS) ratio, where the numerator becomes the enterprise value of the firm. This ratio, again, varies widely across sectors, largely as a function of the profit margins in each. The advantage of using revenue multiples, however, is that it becomes far easier to compare firms in different markets, with different accounting systems at work, than it is to compare earnings or book value multiples. It is also useful in sectors composed of young companies, where most or all are losing money.

# Sector-Specific Multiples

While earnings, book value, and revenue multiples are multiples that can be computed for firms in any sector and across the entire market, there are some multiples that are specific to a sector. For instance, when dot-com firms first appeared on the market in the later 1990s, they had negative earnings and negligible revenues and book value. Analysts looking for a multiple to value these firms divided the market value of each of these firms by the number of hits generated by that firm's web site. Firms with a low market value per customer hit were viewed as more undervalued. More recently, social media companies such as LinkedIn and Facebook have been judged by the market value of equity per member.

While there are conditions under which sector-specific multiples can be justified, and a few are discussed in Chapter 20, they are dangerous for two reasons. First, since they cannot be computed for other sectors or for the entire market, sector-specific multiples can result in persistent overor undervaluations of sectors relative to the rest of the market. Thus, investors who would never consider paying 80 times revenues for a firm might not have the same qualms about paying 2,000 for every page hit (on the web site), largely because they have no sense of what high, low, or average is on this measure. Second, it is far more difficult to relate sector-specific multiples to fundamentals, which is an essential ingredient to using multiples well. For instance, does a visitor to a company's web site translate into higher revenues and profits? And how much value is created by an additional member on a social media site? The answer will not only vary from company to company, but will also be difficult to estimate looking forward.

# FOUR BASIC STEPS TO USING MULTIPLES

Multiples are easy to use and easy to misuse. There are four basic steps to using multiples wisely and for detecting misuse in the hands of others. The first step is to ensure that the multiple is defined consistently and that it is measured uniformly across the firms being compared. The second step is to be aware of the cross-sectional distribution of the multiple, not only across firms in the sector being analyzed but also across the entire market. The third step is to analyze the multiple and understand not only what fundamentals determine the multiple but also how changes in these fundamentals translate into changes in the multiple. The final step is finding the right firms to use for comparison, and controlling for differences that may persist across these firms.

# Definitional Tests

Even the simplest multiples can be defined differently by different analysts. Consider, for instance, the price-earnings (PE) ratio. Most analysts define it to be the market price divided by the earnings per share, but that is where the consensus ends. There are a number of variants on the PE ratio. While the current price is conventionally used in the numerator, there are some analysts who use the average price over the prior six months or year. The earnings per share in the denominator can be the earnings per share from the most recent financial year (yielding the current PE), the last four quarters of earnings (yielding the trailing PE), or expected earnings per share in the next financial year (resulting in a forward PE). In addition, earnings per share can be computed based on primary shares outstanding or fully diluted shares, and can include or exclude extraordinary items. Figure 17.1 provides the PE ratios for Apple in May 2011, using each of these measures.

Not only can these variants on earnings yield vastly different values for the price-earnings ratio, but the one that gets used by analysts depends on their biases. For instance, in periods of rising earnings, the forward PE yields consistently lower values than the trailing PE, which, in turn, is lower than the current PE. A bullish analyst will tend to use the forward PE to make the case that the stock is trading at a low multiple of earnings, while a bearish analyst will focus on the current PE to make the case that the multiple is too high. The first step when discussing a valuation based on a multiple is to ensure that everyone in the discussion is using the same definition for that multiple.

Consistency Every multiple has a numerator and a denominator. The numerator can be either an equity value (such as market price or value of equity) or a firm value (such as enterprise value, which is the sum of the values of debt and equity, net of cash). The denominator can be an equity measure (such as earnings per share, net income, or book value of equity) or a firm measure (such as operating income, EBITDA, or book value of capital).

FIGURE 17.1 PE Ratios—Apple in May 2011

One of the key tests to run on a multiple is to examine whether the numerator and denominator are defined consistently. If the numerator for a multiple is an equity value, then the denominator should be an equity value as well. If the numerator is a firm value, then the denominator should be a firm value as well. To illustrate, the price-earnings ratio is a consistently defined multiple, since the numerator is the price per share (which is an equity value) and the denominator is earnings per share (which is also an equity value). So is the enterprise value to EBITDA multiple, since the numerator and denominator are both firm value measures.

Are there any multiples in use that are inconsistently defined? Consider the Price-to-EBITDA multiple, a multiple that acquired a few adherents in the past few years. The numerator in this multiple is an equity value, and the denominator is a measure of earnings to the firm. The analysts who use this multiple will probably argue that the inconsistency does not matter since the multiple is computed the same way for all of the comparable firms; but they would be wrong. If some firms on the list have no debt and others carry significant amounts of debt, the latter will look cheap on a Price-to-EBITDA basis, when in fact they might be overpriced or correctly priced.

Uniformity In relative valuation, the multiple is computed for all of the firms in a group and then compared across these firms to make judgments on which firms are overpriced and which are underpriced. For this comparison to have any merit, the multiple has to be defined uniformly across all of the firms in the group. Thus, if the trailing PE is used for one firm, it has to be used for all of the others as well. In fact, one of the problems with using the current PE to compare firms in a group is that different firms can have different fiscal year-ends. This can lead to some firms having their prices divided by earnings from July to June, with other firms having their prices divided by earnings from January to December. While the differences can be minor in mature sectors, where earnings do not make quantum jumps over six months, they can be large in high-growth sectors.

With both earnings and book value measures, there is another component to be concerned about, and that is the accounting standards used to estimate earnings and book values. Differences in accounting standards can result in very different earnings and book value numbers for similar firms. This makes comparisons of multiples across firms in different markets, with different accounting standards, very difficult. Even with the same accounting standards, the fact that some firms use different accounting rules (on depreciation and expensing) for reporting purposes and tax purposes and others do not can throw off comparisons of earnings multiples.

# Descriptive Tests

When using a multiple, it is always useful to have a sense of what a high value, a low value, or a typical value for that multiple is in the market. In other words, knowing the distributional characteristics of a multiple is a key part of using that multiple to identify underor overvalued firms. In addition, you need to understand the effects of outliers on averages and unearth any biases in these values introduced in the process of estimating multiples.

Distributional Characteristics Many analysts who use multiples have a sector focus and have a sense of how different firms in their sector rank on specific multiples. What is often lacking, however, is a sense of how the multiple is distributed across the entire market. Why, you might ask, should a software analyst care about price-earnings ratios of utility stocks? Because both software and utility stocks are competing for the same investment dollar, they have to, in a sense, play by the same rules. Furthermore, an awareness of how multiples vary across sectors can be very useful in detecting when the sector you are analyzing is overor undervalued.

What are the distributional characteristics that matter? The standard statistics—the average and standard deviation—are where you should start, but they represent the beginning of the exploration. The fact that multiples such as the price-earnings ratio can never be less than zero and are unconstrained in terms of a maximum results in distributions for these multiples that are skewed toward the positive values. Consequently, the average values for these multiples will be higher than median values,[2] and the latter are much more representative of the typical firm in the group. While the maximum and minimum values are usually of limited use, the percentile values (10th percentile, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, 90th percentile, and so on) can be useful in judging what is a high or low value for the multiple in the group.

Outliers and Averages As noted earlier, multiples are unconstrained on the upper end, and firms can have price-earnings ratios of 500 or 2,000 or even 10,000. This can occur not only because of high stock prices but also because earnings at firms can sometimes drop to a fraction of a cent. These outliers will result in averages that are not representative of the sample. In most cases, services that compute and report average values for multiples either throw out these outliers when computing the averages or constrain the multiples to be less than or equal to a fixed number. For instance, any firm that has a price-earnings ratio greater than 500 may be given a price-earnings ratio of 500.

When using averages obtained from a service, it is important that you know how the service dealt with outliers in computing the averages. In fact, the sensitivity of the estimated average to outliers is another reason for looking at the median values for multiples.

Biases in Estimating Multiples With every multiple, there are firms for which the multiple cannot be computed. Consider again the price-earnings ratio. When the earnings per share are negative, the price-earnings ratio for a firm is not meaningful and is usually not reported. When looking at the average price-earnings ratio across a group of firms, the firms with negative earnings will all drop out of the sample because the price-earnings ratio cannot be computed. Why should this matter when the sample is large? The fact that the firms that are taken out of the sample are the firms losing money creates a bias in the selection process and skews the statistics.

There are three solutions to this problem. The first is to be aware of the bias and build it into the analysis. In practical terms, this will mean adjusting the average PE to reflect the elimination of the money-losing firms. The second is to aggregate the market value of equity and net income (or loss) for all of the firms in the group, including the money-losing ones, and compute the price-earnings ratio using the aggregated values. Figure 17.2 summarizes the average PE ratio, the median PE ratio, and the PE ratio based on aggregated earnings for three sectors: software, chemicals, and insurance companies. While the values are very different for software companies, they are closer for the other two sectors, mostly because the software sector has more companies with negative earnings and extreme (high) PE ratios. Note that the median PE ratio is lower than the average PE ratio in all three sectors. The third choice is to use a multiple that can be computed for all of the firms in the group. The inverse of the price-earning ratio, which is called the earnings yield, can be computed for all firms, including those losing money.

# Analytical Tests

In discussing why analysts were so fond of using multiples, it was argued that relative valuations require fewer assumptions than discounted cash flow valuations. While this is technically true, it is so only on the surface. In reality, you make just as many assumptions when you do a relative valuation as you make in a discounted cash flow valuation. The difference is that the assumptions in a relative valuation are implicit and unstated, whereas those in discounted cash flow valuation are explicit. The two primary questions that you need to answer before using a multiple are: What are the fundamentals that determine at what multiple a firm should trade? How do changes in the fundamentals affect the multiple?

Determinants In the chapters on discounted cash flow valuation, we observed that the value of a firm is a function of three variables—its capacity to generate cash flows, its expected growth in these cash flows, and the uncertainty associated with these cash flows. Every multiple, whether it is of earnings, revenues, or book value, is a function of the same three variables—risk, growth, and cash flow generating potential. Intuitively, then, firms with higher growth rates, less risk, and greater cash flow generating potential should trade at higher multiples than firms with lower growth, higher risk, and less cash flow potential.

The specific measures of growth, risk, and cash flow generating potential that are used will vary from multiple to multiple. To look under the hood, so to speak, of equity and firm value multiples, you can go back to fairly simple discounted cash flow models for equity and enterprise value (EV) and use them to derive the multiples.

In the simplest discounted cash flow model for equity, which is a stable growth dividend discount model, the value of equity is:

$$
\text {V a l u e o f e q u i t y} = \mathrm {P} _ {0} = \frac {\mathrm {D P S} _ {1}}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}
$$ where  $\mathrm{DPS}_1$  is the expected dividend in the next year,  $\mathbf{k}_{\mathrm{e}}$  is the cost of equity, and  $\mathbf{g}_{\mathrm{n}}$  is the expected stable growth rate. Dividing both sides by the earnings, you obtain the discounted cash flow equation specifying the PE ratio for a stable growth firm:


$$

\frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {E P S} _ {0}} = \mathrm {P E} = \frac {\text {P a y o u t r a t i o} \times (1 + \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}})}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$

Dividing both sides by the book value of equity, you can estimate the price-book value ratio for a stable growth firm:

$$

\frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {B V} _ {0}} = \mathrm {P B V} = \frac {\mathrm {R O E} \times \text {P a y o u t r a t i o} \times (1 + \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}})}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$ where ROE is the return on equity. Dividing by the sales per share, the price-sales ratio for a stable-growth firm can be estimated as a function of its profit margin, payout ratio, profit margin, and expected growth.


$$

\frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {B V} _ {0}} = \mathrm {P B V} = \frac {\mathrm {R O E} \times \text {P a y o u t r a t i o} \times (1 + \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}})}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$

You can do a similar analysis to derive the firm value multiples. The value of the operating assets of a firm in stable growth can be written as:

$$

\text {V a l u e o f o p e r a t i n g a s s e t s} = \mathrm {E V} _ {0} = \frac {\mathrm {F C F F} _ {1}}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {c}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$

Dividing both sides by the expected free cash flow to the firm yields the EV-to-FCFF multiple for a stable growth firm:

$$

\frac {\mathrm {E V} _ {0}}{\mathrm {F C F F} _ {1}} = \frac {1}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {c}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$

Since the free cash flow the firm is the after-tax operating income netted against the net capital expenditures and working capital needs of the firm, the multiples of EBIT, after-tax EBIT, and EBITDA can also be estimated similarly.

The point of this analysis is not to suggest that you go back to using discounted cash flow valuation, but to understand the variables that may cause these multiples to vary across firms in the same sector. If you ignore these variables, you might conclude that a stock with a PE of 8 is cheaper than one with a PE of 12, when the true reason may be that the latter has higher expected growth; or you might decide that a stock with a PBV ratio of 0.7 is cheaper than one with a PBV ratio of 1.5, when the true reason may be that the latter has a much higher return on equity.

Relationship Knowing the fundamentals that determine a multiple is a useful first step, but understanding how the multiple changes as the fundamentals change is just as critical to using the multiple. To illustrate, knowing that higher-growth firms have higher PE ratios is not a sufficient insight if you are called on to analyze whether a firm with a growth rate that is twice as high as the average growth rate for the sector should have a PE ratio that is 1.5 times or 1.8 times or 2 times the average price-earnings ratio for the sector. To make this judgment, you need to know how the PE ratio changes as the growth rate changes.

A surprisingly large number of analyses are based on the assumption that there is a linear relationship between multiples and fundamentals. For instance, the price-earnings/growth (PEG) ratio, which is the ratio of the PE to the expected growth rate of a firm and widely used to analyze high-growth firms, implicitly assumes that PE ratios and expected growth rates are linearly related.

One of the advantages of deriving the multiples from a discounted cash flow model, as was done in the last section, is that you can analyze the relationship between each fundamental variable and the multiple by keeping everything else constant and changing the value of that variable.

**Companion Variable** While the variables that determine a multiple can be extracted from a discounted cash flow model, and the relationship between each variable and the multiple can be developed by holding all else constant and asking what-if questions, there is one variable that dominates when it comes to explaining each multiple. This variable, which is called the companion variable, can usually be identified by looking at how multiples vary across firms in a sector or across the entire market. In the next three chapters, the companion variables for the most widely used multiples from the price-earnings ratio to the value-to-sales multiples are identified and then used in analysis.

# Application Tests

When multiples are used, they tend to be used in conjunction with comparable firms to determine the value of a firm or its equity. But what is a comparable firm? While the conventional practice is to look at firms within the same industry or business as comparable firms, this is not necessarily always the correct or the best way of identifying these firms. In addition, no matter how carefully you choose comparable firms, differences will remain between the firm you are valuing and the comparable firms. Figuring out how to control for these differences is a significant part of relative valuation.

What Is a Comparable Firm? A comparable firm is one with cash flows, growth potential, and risk similar to the firm being valued. It would be ideal if you could value a firm by looking at how an exactly identical firm—in terms of risk, growth, and cash flows—is priced. Nowhere in this definition is there a component that relates to the industry or sector to which a firm belongs. Thus a telecommunications firm can be compared to a software firm if the two are identical in terms of cash flows, growth, and risk. In most analyses, however, analysts define comparable firms to be other firms in the firm's business or businesses. If there are enough firms in the industry to allow for it, this list is pruned further using other criteria; for instance, only firms of similar size may be considered. The implicit assumption being made here is that firms in the same sector have similar risk, growth, and cash flow profiles and therefore can be compared with much more legitimacy.

The key question that you face in coming up with the list of comparable firms then becomes how narrowly you define a comparable firm. If you define it as a firm that looks just like the firm you are valuing on every dimension (risk, growth, and cash flows) you may find only a handful of comparable firms. If you define it more broadly and are willing to accept differences on one or all of the dimensions, your comparable firm list will be longer. If you can find ways of controlling for differences across companies (and the next section presents a few choices), you will get more reliable estimates of relative value using a larger sample of less comparable firms than a very small sample of more comparable ones.


With globalization, you are faced with a new challenge, where companies in a sector are incorporated and trade in different markets. Thus, in the automobile sector, you can have U.S., European, and Asian firms all competing for market share globally. Can you compare companies that are listed on different markets? Sure, as long as you recognize that these companies can have different risk, growth, and cash flow characteristics. Thus, Asian automobile companies may have higher growth potential and risk exposure than European firms. In addition, differences in accounting standards and currencies can skew both market and accounting numbers and have to be controlled for.

Controlling for Differences across Firms No matter how carefully you construct your list of comparable firms, you will end up with firms that are different from the firm you are valuing. The differences may be small on some variables and large on others, and you will have to control for these differences in a relative valuation. There are three ways of controlling for these differences: subjective adjustments, modified multiples, and sector or market regressions.

Subjective Adjustments Relative valuation begins with two choices—the multiple used in the analysis and the group of firms that comprises the comparable firms. The multiple is calculated for each of the comparable firms, and the average is computed. To evaluate an individual firm, you then compare the multiple it trades at to the average computed; if it is significantly different, you make a subjective judgment about whether the firm's individual characteristics (growth, risk, or cash flows) may explain the difference. Thus, a firm may have a PE ratio of 22 in a sector where the average PE is only 15, but you may conclude that this difference can be justified because the firm has higher growth potential than the average firm in the industry. If, in your judgment, the difference on the multiple cannot be explained by the fundamentals, the firm will be viewed as overvalued (if its multiple is higher than the average) or undervalued (if its multiple is lower than the average).

Modified Multiples In this approach, you modify the multiple to take into account the most important variable determining it—the companion variable. Thus, the PE ratio is divided by the expected growth rate in EPS for a company to determine a growth-adjusted PE ratio or the PEG ratio. These modified ratios are then compared across companies in a sector. The implicit assumption you make is that these firms are comparable on all the measures of value, other than the one being controlled for. In addition, you are assuming that the relationship between the multiples and fundamentals is linear.

Andres Wines undervalued on a relative basis? A simple view of multiples would lead you to conclude this because its PE ratio of 8.96 was significantly lower than the average for the industry.

In making this comparison, we are assuming that Andres Wines had growth and risk characteristics similar to the average for the sector. One way of bringing growth into the comparison is to compute the PEG ratio, which is reported in the last column. Based on the average PEG ratio of 2.00 for the sector and the estimated growth rate for Andres Wines, you obtain the following value for the PE ratio for Andres:

$$

\mathrm{PEratio} = 2.00\times 3.50\% = 7.00

$$

Based on this adjusted PE, Andres Wines looks overvalued even though it had a low PE ratio. While this may seem like an easy adjustment to resolve the problem of differences across firms, the conclusion holds only if these firms are of equivalent risk. Implicitly, this approach also assumes a linear relationship between growth rates and PE.

Sector Regressions When firms differ on more than one variable, it becomes difficult to modify the multiple to account for the differences across firms. You can run a regression of the multiple against the variables and then use this regression to find the predicted value for each firm. This approach works reasonably well when the number of comparable firms is large and the relationship between the multiple and the variables is stable. When these conditions do not hold, a few outliers can cause the coefficients to change dramatically and make the predictions much less reliable.

The price-earnings ratio is a function of the expected growth rate, risk, and the payout ratio. While there is not a wide variation in payout ratios across beverage companies, they differ in terms of risk and growth. The following table summarizes the price-earnings ratios, standard deviation in stock prices, and expected growth rates for the firms on the list:

<table><tr><td>Company Name</td><td>Trailing PE</td><td>Expected Growth</td><td>Standard Deviation</td></tr><tr><td>Coca-Cola Bottling</td><td>29.18</td><td>9.50\%</td><td>20.58\%</td></tr><tr><td>Molson Inc. Ltd. ‘A’</td><td>43.65</td><td>15.50\%</td><td>21.88\%</td></tr><tr><td>Anheuser-Busch</td><td>24.31</td><td>11.00\%</td><td>22.92\%</td></tr><tr><td>Corby Distilleries Ltd.</td><td>16.24</td><td>7.50\%</td><td>23.66\%</td></tr><tr><td>Chalone Wine Group Ltd.</td><td>21.76</td><td>14.00\%</td><td>24.08\%</td></tr><tr><td>Andres Wines Ltd. ‘A’</td><td>8.96</td><td>3.50\%</td><td>24.70\%</td></tr><tr><td>Todhunter Int&#x27;l.</td><td>8.94</td><td>3.00\%</td><td>25.74\%</td></tr><tr><td>Brown-Forman ‘B’</td><td>10.07</td><td>11.50\%</td><td>29.43\%</td></tr><tr><td>Coors (Adolph) ‘B’</td><td>23.02</td><td>10.00\%</td><td>29.52\%</td></tr><tr><td>PepsiCo, Inc.</td><td>33.00</td><td>10.50\%</td><td>31.35\%</td></tr><tr><td>Coca-Cola</td><td>44.33</td><td>19.00\%</td><td>35.51\%</td></tr><tr><td>Boston Beer ‘A’</td><td>10.59</td><td>17.13\%</td><td>39.58\%</td></tr><tr><td>Whitman Corp.</td><td>25.19</td><td>11.50\%</td><td>44.26\%</td></tr><tr><td>Mondavi (Robert) ‘A’</td><td>16.47</td><td>14.00\%</td><td>45.84\%</td></tr><tr><td>Coca-Cola Enterprises</td><td>37.14</td><td>27.00\%</td><td>51.34\%</td></tr><tr><td>Hansen Natural Corp.</td><td>9.70</td><td>17.00\%</td><td>62.45\%</td></tr></table>

Since these firms differ on both risk and expected growth, a regression of PE ratios on both variables is run:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {PE} = 20.87 - 63.98 \text {Standard deviation} + 183.24 \text {Expected growth} \quad \mathrm {R} ^ {2} = 51 \% \\ [ 3. 0 1 ] [ 2. 6 3 ] \quad [ 3. 6 6 ] \\ \end{array}

$$

The numbers in brackets are t-statistics and suggest that the relationships between PE ratios and both variables in the regression are statistically significant. The R-squared indicates the percentage of the differences in PE ratios that is explained by the independent variables. Finally, the regression itself can be used to get predicted PE ratios for the companies in the list. Thus, the predicted PE ratio for Coca-Cola, based on its standard deviation of  $35.51\%$  and the expected growth rate of  $19\%$ , would be:

$$

\text {P r e d i c t e d} \mathrm {P E} _ {\text {C o c a - C o l a}} = 2 0. 8 7 - 6 3. 9 8 (. 3 5 5 1) + 1 8 3. 2 4 (. 1 9) = 3 2. 9 7

$$

Since the actual PE ratio for Coca-Cola was 44.33, this would suggest that the stock was overvalued, given how the rest of the sector was priced.

If you are uncomfortable with the assumption that the relationship between PE and growth is linear, which is what we have assumed in the preceding regression, you could either run nonlinear regressions or modify the variables in the regression to make the relationship more linear. For instance, using the  $\ln (\mathrm{growth}$  rate) instead of the growth rate in the regression yields much better-behaved residuals.

Market Regressions Searching for comparable firms within the sector in which a firm operates is fairly restrictive, especially when there are relatively few firms in the sector or when a firm operates in more than one sector. Since the definition of a comparable firm is not one that is in the same business but one that has the same growth, risk, and cash flow characteristics as the firm being analyzed, you need not restrict your choice of comparable firms to those in the same industry. The regression introduced in the previous section controls for differences on those variables that you believe cause multiples to vary across firms. Based on the variables that determine each multiple, you should be able to regress any multiple (PE, EV/EBITDA, PBV) against the variables, using all of the firms in the market in your sample. You can then use the market regression to get predicted values for individual companies. A company that trades at a PE ratio lower (higher) than the predicted PE from the market regression is undervalued (over valued) relative to the market.

The first advantage of this approach over the subjective comparison across firms in the same sector is that it does quantify, based on actual market data, the degree to which higher growth or risk should affect the multiples. It is true that these estimates can have error associated with them, but this error is a reflection of the reality that many analysts choose not to face when they make subjective judgments. Second, by looking at all firms in the market, this approach allows you to make more meaningful comparisons of firms that operate in industries with relatively few firms. Third, it allows you to examine whether all firms in an industry are under- or overvalued by estimating their values relative to other firms in the market.

# RECONCILING RELATIVE AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW VALUATIONS

The two approaches to valuation—discounted cash flow valuation and relative valuation—will generally yield different estimates of value for the same firm. Furthermore, even within relative valuation, you can arrive at different estimates of value, depending on which multiple you use and what firms you based the relative valuation on.

The differences in value between discounted cash flow valuation and relative valuation come from different views of market efficiency, or, put more precisely, market inefficiency. In discounted cash flow valuation, you assume that markets make mistakes, that they correct these mistakes over time, and that these mistakes can often occur across entire sectors or even the entire market. In relative valuation, you assume that while markets make mistakes on individual stocks, they are correct on average. In other words, when you value Adobe Systems relative to other software companies, you are assuming that the market has priced these companies correctly on average even though it might have made mistakes in the pricing of each of them individually. Thus, a stock may be overvalued on a discounted cash flow basis but undervalued on a relative basis, if the firms used in the relative valuation are all overpriced by the market. The reverse would occur, if an entire sector or market were underpriced.

# CONCLUSION

In relative valuation, you estimate the value of an asset by looking at how similar assets are priced. To make this comparison, you begin by converting prices into multiples—standardizing prices—and then comparing these multiples across firms that you define as comparable. Prices can be standardized based on earnings, book value, revenue, or sector-specific variables.


While the allure of multiples remains their simplicity, there are four steps in using them soundly. First, you have to define the multiple consistently and measure it uniformly across the firms being compared. Second, you need to have a sense of how the multiple varies across firms in the market. In other words, you need to know what a high value, a low value, and a typical value are for the multiple in question. Third, you need to identify the fundamental variables that determine each multiple and how changes in these fundamentals affect the value of the multiple. Finally, you need to find truly comparable firms and adjust for differences between the firms on fundamental characteristics.

# Earnings Multiples

Earnings multiples remain the most commonly used measures of relative value. This chapter begins with a detailed examination of the price-earnings ratio and then moves on to consider variants of the multiple—the PEG ratio and relative PE. It also looks at value multiples, and, in particular, the Enterprise Value to EBITDA multiple in the last part of the chapter. The four-step process described in Chapter 17 is used to look at each of these multiples.

# PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO

The price-earnings (PE) multiple is the most widely used and misused of all multiples. Its simplicity makes it an attractive choice in applications ranging from pricing initial public offerings to making judgments on relative value, but its relationship to a firm's financial fundamentals is often ignored, leading to significant errors in applications. This chapter provides some insight into the determinants of price-earnings ratios and how best to use them in valuation.

# Definitions of PE Ratio

The price-earnings ratio is the ratio of the market price per share to the earnings per share:

$$

\mathrm {P E} = \text {M a r k e t p r i c e p e r s h a r e / E a r n i n g s p e r s h a r e}

$$

The PE ratio is consistently defined, with the numerator being the value of equity per share and the denominator measuring earnings per share, which is a measure of equity earnings. The biggest problem with PE ratios is the variations on earnings per share used in computing the multiple. In Chapter 17, we saw that PE ratios could be computed using current earnings per share, trailing earnings per share, forward earnings per share, fully diluted earnings per share, and primary earnings per share.

Especially with high-growth (and high-risk) firms, the PE ratio can be very different depending on which measure of earnings per share is used. This can be explained by two factors:

1. The volatility in earnings per share at these firms. Forward earnings per share can be substantially higher (or lower) than trailing earnings per share, which, in turn, can be significantly different from current earnings per share.

2. Management options. Since high-growth firms tend to have far more employee options outstanding, relative to the number of shares, the differences between diluted and primary earnings per share tend to be large.

When the PE ratios of firms are compared, it is difficult to ensure that the earnings per share are uniformly estimated across the firms for the following reasons:

Firms often grow by acquiring other firms, and they do not account for acquisitions the same way. While all companies now have to use purchase accounting and record goodwill as an asset, there is enough discretion in the process to make a material difference in reported earnings. These differences lead to different measures of earnings per share and different PE ratios.
Using diluted earnings per share in estimating PE ratios might bring the shares that are covered by management options into the multiple, but they treat options that are deep in-the-money or only slightly in-the-money as equivalent.
■ Firm often have discretion in whether they expense or capitalize items, at least for reporting purposes. The expensing of a capital expense gives firms a way of shifting earnings from period to period, and penalizes those firms that are reinvesting more.

# Cross-Sectional Distribution of PE Ratios

A critical step in using PE ratios is to understand how the cross-sectional multiple is distributed across firms in the sector and the market. In this section, the distribution of PE ratios across the entire market is examined.

Market Distribution Figure 18.1 presents the distribution of PE ratios for U.S. stocks in January 2011. The current PE, trailing PE, and forward PE ratios are all presented in this figure.

Table 18.1 presents summary statistics on all three measures of the price-earnings ratio, starting with the mean and the median and the 25th and 75th percentile values. In computing these values, the PE ratio is set at 200 if it is greater than 200, to prevent outliers from having too large an influence on the summary statistics. $^{1}$

Looking at all three measures of the PE ratio, the average is consistently higher than the median, reflecting the fact that PE ratios can be very high numbers but cannot be less than zero. This asymmetry in the distributions is captured in the skewness values. The current PE ratios are also higher than the trailing PE ratios, which, in turn, are usually higher than the forward PE ratios, reflecting the fact that forward earnings are expected to be higher than trailing earnings.

# Determinants of the PE Ratio

In Chapter 17 the fundamentals that determine multiples were extracted using a discounted cash flow model—an equity model like the dividend discount model for equity multiples and a firm value model for firm multiples. The price-earnings ratio, being an equity multiple, can be analyzed using a equity valuation model. In this section, the fundamentals that determine the price-earnings ratio for a high-growth firm are analyzed.

Discounted Cash Flow Model Perspective on PE Ratios In Chapter 17 we derived the PE ratio for a stable growth firm from the stable growth dividend discount model:

$$

\frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {E P S} _ {0}} = \mathrm {P E} = \frac {\text {P a y o u t r a t i o} \times \left(1 + \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}\right)}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$

If the PE ratio is stated in terms of expected earnings in the next time period, this can be simplified to:

$$

\frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {E P S} _ {1}} = \text {F o r w a r d} \mathrm {P E} = \frac {\text {P a y o u t r a t i o}}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$

The PE ratio is an increasing function of the payout ratio and the growth rate and a decreasing function of the riskiness of the firm. In fact, we can state the payout ratio as a function of the expected growth rate and return on equity:

Payout ratio  $= 1 -$  Expected growth rate/Return on equity  $= 1 - \mathrm{g}_{\mathrm{n}} / \mathrm{ROE}_{\mathrm{n}}$

Substituting back into the equation,

$$

\frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {E P S} _ {1}} = \text {F o r w a r d} \mathrm {P E} = \frac {1 - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}} / \mathrm {R O E} _ {\mathrm {n}}}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$

The price-earnings ratio for a high-growth firm can also be related to fundamentals. Using the two-stage dividend discount model, this relationship can be made explicit fairly simply. When a firm is expected to be in high growth for the next  $n$  years and stable growth thereafter, the dividend discount model can be written as follows:

$$

\begin{array}{l} P _ {0} = \frac {\mathrm {E P S} _ {0} \times \text {P a y o u t r a t i o} \times (1 + \mathrm {g}) \times \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 + \mathrm {g}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}}{(1 + \mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}} \right]}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}} - \mathrm {g}} \\ + \frac {\mathrm {E P S} _ {0} \times \text {P a y o u t r a t i o} _ {\mathrm {n}} \times (1 + \mathrm {g}) ^ {\mathrm {n}} \times (1 + \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}})}{(\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}, \mathrm {s t}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}) (1 + \mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}, \mathrm {h g}}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}} \\ \end{array}

$$ where  $\mathrm{EPS}_0 =$  Earnings per share in year 0 (current year)

$\mathrm{g} =$  Growth rate in the first n years

$\mathrm{k}_{\mathrm{e,hg}} =$  Cost of equity in high growth period

${\mathrm{k}}_{\mathrm{e},\mathrm{{st}}} =$  Cost of equity in stable growth period

Payout = Payout ratio in the first n years

$\mathbf{g}_{\mathrm{n}} =$  Growth rate after n years, forever (stable growth rate)

$\mathrm{Payout}_{\mathrm{n}} = \mathrm{Payout}$  ratio after n years for the stable firm

Bringing  $\mathrm{EPS}_0$  to the left-hand side of the equation,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {E P S} _ {0}} = \frac {\text {P a y o u t r a t i o} \times (1 + \mathrm {g}) \times \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 + \mathrm {g}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}}{(1 + \mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}} \right]}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}} - \mathrm {g}} \\ + \frac {\text {P a y o u t r a t i o} _ {\mathrm {n}} \times (1 + \mathrm {g}) ^ {\mathrm {n}} \times (1 + \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}})}{(\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {s t}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}) (1 + \mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}} \\ \end{array}
$$

Here again, we can substitute in the fundamental equation relating ROE for payout ratios:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {E P S} _ {0}} = \frac {\left(1 - \frac {\mathrm {g}}{\mathrm {R O E} _ {\mathrm {h g}}}\right) \times (1 + \mathrm {g}) \times \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 + \mathrm {g}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}}{(1 + \mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}} \right]}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}} - \mathrm {g}} \\ + \frac {\left(1 - \frac {\mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}{\mathrm {R O E} _ {\mathrm {s t}}}\right) \times (1 + \mathrm {g}) ^ {\mathrm {n}} \times (1 + \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}})}{\left(\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {s t}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}\right) \left(1 + \mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}}\right) ^ {\mathrm {n}}} \\ \end{array}
$$ where  $\mathrm{ROE}_{\mathrm{hg}}$  is the return on equity in the high growth period and  $\mathrm{ROE}_{\mathrm{st}}$  is the return on equity in stable growth.


The left-hand side of the equation is the price-earnings ratio. It is determined by:
- Payout ratio (and return on equity) during the high growth period and in the stable period. The PE ratio increases as the payout ratio increases, for any given growth rate. An alternative way of stating the same proposition is that the PE ratio increases as the return on equity increases, for any given growth rate, and decreases as the return on equity decreases.
■ Riskiness (through the discount rate). The PE ratio becomes lower as riskiness increases. Put differently, the PE ratio will be higher for a firm where its growth is more predictable and stable than for an otherwise similar firm with unstable growth.
Expected growth rate in earnings in both the high-growth and stable phases. The PE increases as the growth rate increases, assuming that the ROE  $>$  cost of equity.

This formula is general enough to be applied to any firm, even one that is not paying dividends right now. In fact, the ratio of FCFE to earnings can be substituted for the payout ratio for firms that pay significantly less in dividends than they can afford to.
