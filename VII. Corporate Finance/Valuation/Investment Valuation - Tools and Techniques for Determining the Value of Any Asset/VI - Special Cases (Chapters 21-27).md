# ILLUSTRATION 18.1: Estimating the PE Ratio for a High-Growth Firm in the Two-Stage Model

Assume that you have been asked to estimate the PE ratio for a firm that has the following characteristics:

Length of high growth = five years

Growth rate in first five years  $= 25\%$

Growth rate after five years  $= 8\%$

Beta = 1.0

Cost of equity  ${}^{2} = 6\%  + 1\left( {{5.5}\% }\right)  = {11.5}\%$

Payout ratio in first five years  $= 20\%$

Payout ratio after five years  $= 50\%$

Risk-free rate  $=$  T-bond rate  $= 6\%$

Risk premium  $= 5.5\%$

$$
P E = \frac {0 . 2 \times (1 . 2 5) \times \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 . 2 5) ^ {5}}{(1 . 1 1 5) ^ {5}} \right]}{. 1 1 5 -. 2 5} + \frac {0 . 5 \times (1 . 2 5) ^ {5} \times (1 . 0 8)}{(. 1 1 5 -. 0 8) (1 . 1 1 5) ^ {5}} = 2 8. 7 5
$$

The estimated PE ratio for this firm is 28.75. Note that the return on equity implicit in these inputs can also be computed as follows:

Return on equity in first five years  $=$  Growth rate/(1 - Payout ratio)  $= .25 / .8 = 31.25\%$

Return on equity in stable growth  $= .08 / .5 = 16\%$

# ILLUSTRATION 18.2: Estimating an Intrinsic PE Ratio—P&G in May 2011

In Chapter 13, we valued P&G using a two-stage dividend discount model. We reproduce the inputs that we used in the valuation in the following table:

<table><tr><td></td><td>High Growth</td><td>Stable Growth</td></tr><tr><td>Length of growth</td><td>5 years</td><td>After year 5</td></tr><tr><td>Expected growth rate</td><td>10.00\%</td><td>3.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Payout ratio</td><td>50.00\%</td><td>75.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of equity</td><td>8.00\%</td><td>8.50\%</td></tr></table>

Note that we derived the payout ratio in stable growth from the stable growth rate and the stable period ROE:

$$
\text{Stable payout ratio} = 1 - 3 \% / 12 \% = 75 \%
$$

We plug these values into the two-stage PE ratio equation:

$$
P E = \frac {(0 . 5 0) (1 . 1 0) \left(1 - \frac {(1 . 1 0) ^ {5}}{(1 . 0 8) ^ {5}}\right)}{(0 . 0 8 - 0 . 1 0)} + \frac {(0 . 7 5) (1 . 1 0) ^ {5} (1 . 0 3)}{(0 . 0 8 5 - 0 . 0 3) (1 . 0 8) ^ {5}} = 1 8. 0 4
$$

Based on its fundamentals, we would expect P&G to trade at 18.04 times earnings. Not surprisingly, multiplying this intrinsic PE ratio by the current EPS of  \$3.82 yields\$ 68.90, the same value that we estimated using the two-stage dividend discount model in Chapter 13.

PE Ratios and Expected Extraordinary Growth The PE ratio of a high growth firm is a function of the expected extraordinary growth rate—the higher the expected growth, the higher the PE ratio for a firm. In Illustration 18.1, for instance, the PE ratio that was estimated to be 28.75, with a growth rate of 25 percent, will change as that expected growth rate changes. Figure 18.2 graphs the PE ratio as a function of the expected growth rate during the high growth period. As the firm's expected growth rate in the first five years declines from 25 percent to 5 percent, the PE ratio for the firm also decreases from 28.75 to just above 10.

The effect of changes in the expected growth rate varies depending on the level of interest rates. In Figure 18.3, the PE ratios are estimated for different expected growth rates at four levels of riskless rates—4 percent, 6 percent, 8 percent, and 10 percent.

The PE ratio is much more sensitive to changes in expected growth rates when interest rates are low than when they are high. The reason is simple. Growth produces cash flows in the future, and the present value of these cash flows is much smaller at high interest rates. Consequently, the effect of changes in the growth rate on the present value tends to be smaller.

There is a possible link between this finding and how markets react to earnings surprises from high growth firms. When a firm reports earnings that are significantly higher than expected (a positive surprise) or lower than expected (a negative surprise), investors' perceptions of the expected growth rate for this firm can change concurrently, leading to a value effect. You would expect to see much greater price reactions for a given earnings surprise, positive or negative, in a low-interest-rate environment than you would in a high-interest-rate environment.

FIGURE 18.3 PE Ratios and Expected Growth: Interest Rate Scenarios

PE Ratios and Risk The PE ratio is a function of the perceived risk of a firm, and the effect shows up in the cost of equity. A firm with a higher cost of equity will trade at a lower multiple of earnings than a similar firm with a lower cost of equity.

Again, the effect of higher risk on PE ratios can be seen using the firm in Illustration 18.1. Recall that the firm, which has an expected growth rate of 25 percent for the next five years and 8 percent thereafter, has an estimated PE ratio of 28.75, if its beta is assumed to be 1.

$$
\mathrm {P E} = \frac {0 . 2 \times (1 . 2 5) \times \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 . 2 5) ^ {5}}{(1 . 1 1 5) ^ {5}} \right]}{. 1 1 5 -. 2 5} + \frac {0 . 5 \times (1 . 2 5) ^ {5} \times (1 . 0 8)}{(. 1 1 5 -. 0 8) (1 . 1 1 5) ^ {5}} = 2 8. 7 5
$$

If you assume that the beta is 1.5, the cost of equity increases to 14.25 percent, leading to a PE ratio of 14.87:

$$
\mathrm {P E} = \frac {0 . 2 \times (1 . 2 5) \times \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 . 2 5) ^ {5}}{(1 . 1 4 2 5) ^ {5}} \right]}{. 1 4 2 5 -. 2 5} + \frac {0 . 5 \times (1 . 2 5) ^ {5} \times (1 . 0 8)}{(. 1 4 2 5 -. 0 8) (1 . 1 4 2 5) ^ {5}} = 1 4. 8 7
$$

The higher cost of equity reduces the value created by expected growth.

In Figure 18.4, you can see the impact of changing the beta on the price earnings ratio for four high growth scenarios—8 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent, and 25 percent for the next five years.

FIGURE 18.4 PE Ratios and Beta: Growth Rate Scenarios

As the beta increases, the PE ratio decreases in all four scenarios. However, the difference between the PE ratios across the four growth classes is less when the beta is very high, and increases as the beta decreases. This would suggest that at very high risk levels, a firm's PE ratio is likely to increase more as the risk decreases than as growth increases. For many high-growth firms that are viewed as both very risky and having good growth potential, reducing risk may increase value much more than increasing expected growth.

# Using the PE Ratio for Comparisons

Now that we have defined the PE ratio, looked at the cross-sectional distribution, and examined the fundamentals that determine the multiple, we can use PE ratios to make valuation judgments. This section begins by looking at how best to compare the PE ratio for a market over time and follows up by a comparison of PE ratios across different markets. Finally, it uses PE ratios to analyze firms within a sector and then expands the analysis to the entire market. In doing so, note that PE ratios vary across time, markets, industries, and firms because of differences in fundamentals—higher growth, lower risk, and higher payout generally result in higher PE ratios. When comparisons are made, you have to control for these differences in risk, growth rates, and payout ratios.

Comparing a Market's PE Ratio across Time Analysts and market strategists often compare the PE ratio of a market to its historical average to make judgments about whether the market is underor overvalued. Thus a market that is trading at a PE ratio is much higher than its historical norms is often considered to be overvalued, whereas one that is trading at a ratio lower than its historical norms is considered undervalued.

While reversion to historic norms remains a very strong force in financial markets, you should be cautious about drawing too strong a conclusion from such comparisons. As the fundamentals (interest rates, risk premiums, expected growth, and payout) change over time, the PE ratio will also change. Other things remaining equal, for instance, you would expect the following:

An increase in interest rates should result in a higher cost of equity for the market and a lower PE ratio.

A greater willingness to take risk on the part of investors will result in a lower risk premium for equity and a higher PE ratio across all stocks.

■ An increase in expected growth in earnings across firms will result in a higher PE ratio for the market.

An increase in the return on equity at firms will result in a higher payout ratio for any given growth rate  $\left[\mathrm{g} = (1 - \text{Payout ratio})\mathrm{ROE}\right]$  and a higher PE ratio for all firms.

In other words, it is difficult to draw conclusions about PE ratios without looking at these fundamentals. A more appropriate comparison is therefore not between PE ratios across time, but between the actual PE ratio and the predicted PE ratio based on fundamentals existing at that time.

# ILLUSTRATION 18.3: PE Ratios across Time

The following are the summary economic statistics at two points in time for the same stock market. The interest rates in the first period were significantly higher than the interest rates in the second period.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Period 1</td><td>Period 2</td></tr><tr><td>T-bond rate</td><td>11.00\%</td><td>6.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Market premium</td><td>5.50\%</td><td>5.50\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected inflation</td><td>5.00\%</td><td>4.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected growth in real GNP</td><td>3.00\%</td><td>2.50\%</td></tr><tr><td>Average payout ratio</td><td>50\%</td><td>50\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected PE ratio</td><td>(0.5 × 1.08)/(.165 - .08) = 6.35</td><td>(0.5 × 1.065)/(.115 - .065) = 10.65</td></tr></table>

The PE ratio in the second time period is significantly higher than the PE ratio in the first period, largely because of the drop in real interest rates (nominal interest rate - expected inflation).

# ILLUSTRATION 18.4: PE Ratios across Time for the S&P 500

Figure 18.5 summarizes the earnings-price (EP) ratios for S&P 500 and Treasury bond rates at the end of each year from 1960 to 2010. There is a strong positive relationship between EP ratios and T-bond rates, as evidenced by the correlation of 0.665 between the two variables. In addition, there is evidence that the term structure also affects the PE ratio. In the following regression, we regress EP ratios against the level of T-bond rates and the yield spread (T-bond minus T-bill rate), using data from 1960 to 2010.

$$
\begin{array}{l} E P = 0. 0 2 6 1 + 0. 6 8 6 9 T - b o n d r a t e - 0. 3 6 5 5 (T - b o n d r a t e - T - b i l l r a t e) \quad R ^ {2} = 0. 4 7 8 \\ [ 3. 2 8 ] \quad [ 6. 4 1 ] \quad [ 1. 5 0 ] \\ \end{array}
$$

Other things remaining equal, this regression suggests that:

Every  $1\%$  increase in the T-bond rate increases the EP ratio by  $0.6869\%$ . This is not surprising, but it quantifies the impact that higher interest rates have on the PE ratio.

Every  $1\%$  increase in the difference between T-bond and T-bill rates reduces the EP ratio by  $0.3655\%$ . Flatter or negatively sloping term yield curves seem to correspond to lower PE ratios, and upwardly sloping yield curves to higher PE ratios. While at first sight this may seem surprising, the slope of the yield curve, at least in the United States, has been a leading indicator of economic growth, with more upwardly sloped curves going with higher growth.

Based on this regression, the predicted EP ratio at the beginning of 2011, with the T-bill rate at  $0.13\%$  and the T-bond rate at  $3.29\%$ , would have been:

$$
\begin{array}{l} E P _ {2 0 0 0} = 0. 0 2 6 + 0. 6 8 6 9 (. 0 3 2 9) - 0. 3 6 5 5 (. 0 0 1 3) = 0. 0 4 8 1 \\ \mathrm {P E} _ {2 0 0 0} = 1 / \mathrm {E P} _ {2 0 1 0} = 1 / . 0 4 8 1 = 2 0. 7 7 \\ \end{array}
$$

Since the S&P 500 was trading at a multiple of 15 times earnings in early 2011, this would have indicated an undervalued market. This regression can be enriched by adding other variables that should be correlated to the price-earnings ratio, such as expected growth in gross national product (GNP) and payout ratios, as independent variables. In fact, an argument can be made that the influx of technology stocks into the S&P 500 over the past two decades, the increase in return on equity at U.S. companies over the same period, and a decline in risk premiums could all explain the increase in PE ratios over the period.

FIGURE 18.5 EP Ratios and Interest Rates: 1960 to 2010

Comparing PE Ratios across Countries Comparisons are often made between price-earnings ratios in different countries with the intention of finding undervalued and overvalued markets. Markets with lower PE ratios are viewed as undervalued and those with higher PE ratios are considered overvalued. Given the wide differences that exist between countries on fundamentals, it is misleading to draw these conclusions. For instance, you would expect to see the following, other things remaining equal:

Countries with higher real interest rates should have lower PE ratios than countries with lower real interest rates.

Countries with higher expected real growth should have higher PE ratios than countries with lower real growth.

- Countries that are viewed as riskier (and thus command higher risk premiums) should have lower PE ratios than safer countries.
- Countries where companies are more efficient in their investments (and earn a higher return on these investments) should trade at higher PE ratios.

# ILLUSTRATION 18.5: PE Ratios in Markets with Different Fundamentals

The following are the summary economic statistics for stock markets in two different countries—country 1 and country 2. The key difference between the two countries is that interest rates are much higher in country 1.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Country 1</td><td>Country 2</td></tr><tr><td>T-bond rate</td><td>10.00\%</td><td>5.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Market premium</td><td>4.00\%</td><td>5.50\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected inflation</td><td>4.00\%</td><td>4.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected growth in real GNP</td><td>2.00\%</td><td>3.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Average payout ratio</td><td>50\%</td><td>50\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected PE ratio</td><td>(0.5 × 1.06)/(.14 - .06) = 6.625</td><td>(0.5 × 1.07)/(.105 - .07) = 15.29</td></tr></table>

In this case, the expected PE ratio in country 2 is significantly higher than the PE ratio in country 1, but it can be justified on the basis of differences in financial fundamentals. (Note that nominal growth = real growth rate + expected inflation.)

# ILLUSTRATION 18.6: Comparing PE Ratios across Markets—July 2000

This principle can be extended to broader comparisons of PE ratios across countries. The following table summarizes PE ratios across different developed markets in July 2000, together with dividend yields and interest rates (short-term and long-term) at that time:

<table><tr><td>Country</td><td>PE</td><td>Dividend Yield</td><td>2-Year Rate</td><td>10-Year Rate</td><td>10-Year – 2-Year</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>22.02</td><td>2.59\%</td><td>5.93\%</td><td>5.85\%</td><td>-0.08\%</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>26.33</td><td>1.88\%</td><td>5.06\%</td><td>5.32\%</td><td>0.26\%</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>29.04</td><td>1.34\%</td><td>5.11\%</td><td>5.48\%</td><td>0.37\%</td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland</td><td>19.60</td><td>1.42\%</td><td>3.62\%</td><td>3.83\%</td><td>0.21\%</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>14.74</td><td>2.66\%</td><td>5.15\%</td><td>5.70\%</td><td>0.55\%</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>28.23</td><td>1.76\%</td><td>5.27\%</td><td>5.70\%</td><td>0.43\%</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>32.39</td><td>1.11\%</td><td>4.67\%</td><td>5.26\%</td><td>0.59\%</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>21.10</td><td>2.07\%</td><td>5.10\%</td><td>5.47\%</td><td>0.37\%</td></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>21.69</td><td>3.12\%</td><td>6.29\%</td><td>6.25\%</td><td>-0.04\%</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>52.25</td><td>0.71\%</td><td>0.58\%</td><td>1.85\%</td><td>1.27\%</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>25.14</td><td>1.10\%</td><td>6.05\%</td><td>5.85\%</td><td>-0.20\%</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>26.14</td><td>0.99\%</td><td>5.70\%</td><td>5.77\%</td><td>0.07\%</td></tr></table>

A naive comparison of PE ratios suggests that Japanese stocks, with a PE ratio of 52.25, were overvalued, while Belgian stocks, with a PE ratio of 14.74, are undervalued. There were, however, a strong negative correlation between PE ratios and 10-year interest rates  $(- .73)$  and a positive correlation between the PE ratio and the spread between long and short term rates (.70). A cross-sectional regression of PE ratio on interest rates and expected growth yields the following:

$$
\begin{array}{c} \text {PE ratio} = 42.62 - 360.910\text{-year rate} +846.61(10\text{-year rate} -2\text{-year rate})\\ [ 2.78][1.41][1.08] \end{array} \quad R ^ {2} = 59\%
$$

The coefficients are of marginal significance, partly because of the small size of the sample. Based on this regression, the predicted PE ratios for the countries are shown in the following table:

<table><tr><td>Country</td><td>Actual PE</td><td>Predicted PE</td><td>Underor Overvalued</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>22.02</td><td>20.83</td><td>5.71\%</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>26.33</td><td>25.62</td><td>2.76\%</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>29.04</td><td>25.98</td><td>11.80\%</td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland</td><td>19.60</td><td>30.58</td><td>-35.90\%</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>14.74</td><td>26.71</td><td>-44.81\%</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>28.23</td><td>25.69</td><td>9.89\%</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>32.39</td><td>28.63</td><td>13.12\%</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>21.10</td><td>26.01</td><td>-18.88\%</td></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>21.69</td><td>19.73</td><td>9.96\%</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>52.25</td><td>46.70</td><td>11.89\%</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>25.14</td><td>19.81</td><td>26.88\%</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>26.14</td><td>22.39</td><td>16.75\%</td></tr></table>

From this comparison, Belgian and Swiss stocks would be the most undervalued, while U.S. stocks would have been the most overvalued.

# ILLUSTRATION 18.7: An Example with Emerging Markets—End of 2000

This example is extended to examine PE ratio differences across emerging markets at the end of 2000. In this table, the country risk factor is that estimated by the Economist for these emerging markets, scaled from 0 (safest) to 100 (riskiest).

<table><tr><td>Country</td><td>PE Ratio</td><td>Interest Rate</td><td>GDP Real Growth</td><td>Country Risk</td></tr><tr><td>Argentina</td><td>14</td><td>18.00\%</td><td>2.50\%</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Brazil</td><td>21</td><td>14.00\%</td><td>4.80\%</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Chile</td><td>25</td><td>9.50\%</td><td>5.50\%</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Hong Kong</td><td>20</td><td>8.00\%</td><td>6.00\%</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>India</td><td>17</td><td>11.48\%</td><td>4.20\%</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Indonesia</td><td>15</td><td>21.00\%</td><td>4.00\%</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Malaysia</td><td>14</td><td>5.67\%</td><td>3.00\%</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Mexico</td><td>19</td><td>11.50\%</td><td>5.50\%</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Pakistan</td><td>14</td><td>19.00\%</td><td>3.00\%</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Peru</td><td>15</td><td>18.00\%</td><td>4.90\%</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Philippines</td><td>15</td><td>17.00\%</td><td>3.80\%</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Singapore</td><td>24</td><td>6.50\%</td><td>5.20\%</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>South Korea</td><td>21</td><td>10.00\%</td><td>4.80\%</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Thailand</td><td>21</td><td>12.75\%</td><td>5.50\%</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Turkey</td><td>12</td><td>25.00\%</td><td>2.00\%</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Venezuela</td><td>20</td><td>15.00\%</td><td>3.50\%</td><td>45</td></tr></table>

The regression of PE ratios on these variables provides the following:

$$
\begin{array}{c} \text {PE} = 16.16 - 7.94 \text {Interest rates} + 154.40 \text {Real growth} - 0.112 \text {Country risk} \\ [ 3.61 ] \quad [ 0.52 ] \quad [ 2.38 ] \quad [ 1.78 ] \end{array} \quad R ^ {2} = 74 \%
$$

Countries with higher real growth and lower country risk have higher PE ratios, but the level of interest rates seems to have only a marginal impact. The regression can be used to estimate the price-earnings ratio for Turkey:

$$
\text {P r e d i c t e d P E f o r T u r k e y} = 1 6. 1 6 - 7. 9 4 (. 2 5) + 1 5 4. 4 0 (. 0 2) - 0. 1 1 2 (3 5) = 1 3. 3 5 4
$$

At a PE ratio of 12, the market would have been viewed as slightly undervalued.

Comparing PE Ratios across Firms in a Sector The most common approach to estimating the PE ratio for a firm is to choose a group of comparable firms, to calculate the average PE ratio for this group, and to subjectively adjust this average for differences between the firm being valued and the comparable firms. There are several problems with this approach. First, the definition of a comparable firm is essentially a subjective one. The use of other firms in the industry as the control group is often not the solution because firms within the same industry can have very different business mixes and risk and growth profiles. There is also plenty of potential for bias. One clear example of this is in takeovers, where a high PE ratio for the target firm is justified using the price-earnings ratios of a control group of other firms that have been taken over. This group is designed to give an upwardly biased estimate of the PE ratio and other multiples. Second, even when a legitimate group of comparable firms can be constructed, differences will continue to persist in fundamentals between the firm being valued and this group. It is very difficult to subjectively adjust for differences across firms. Thus, knowing that a firm has much higher growth potential than other firms in the comparable firm list would lead you to estimate a higher PE ratio for that firm, but how much higher is an open question.

The alternative to subjective adjustments is to control explicitly for the one or two variables that you believe account for the bulk of the differences in PE ratios across companies in the sector in a regression. The regression equation can then be used to estimate predicted PE ratios for each firm in the sector, and these predicted values can be compared to the actual PE ratios to make judgments on whether stocks are underor overpriced.

# ILLUSTRATION 18.8: Comparing PE Ratios for Global Telecom Firms—September 2000

The following table summarizes the trailing PE ratios for global telecom firms with American depositary receipts (ADRs) listed in the United States in September 2000. The earnings per share used are those estimated using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and thus should be much more directly comparable than the earnings reported by these firms in their local markets.

The earnings per share represent trailing earnings, and the price-earnings ratios for the firms are reported in the second column. The analyst estimates of expected growth in earnings per share over the next five years are shown in the next column. In the last column, we introduce a dummy variable indicating whether the firm is from an emerging market or a developed one, since emerging market telecom firms are likely to be exposed to far more risk. Not surprisingly, the firms with the lowest PE ratios, such as Telebras and PT Indosat, are from emerging markets.

Regressing the PE ratio for the sector against the expected growth rate and the emerging market dummy yields the following results:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {PE r a t i o} = 13.12 + 121.22 \text {E x p e c t e d g r o w t h - 1 3 . 8 5 E m e r g i n g m a r k e t d u m m y} \\ [ 3.78 ] \quad [ 6.29 ] \quad [ 3.84 ] \end{array} \quad R ^ {2} = 66 \%
$$

Firms with higher growth have significantly higher PE ratios than firms with lower expected growth. In addition, this regression indicates that an emerging market telecom firm should trade at a much lower PE ratio than one in a developed market. Using this regression to get predicted values, we get:

Based on the predicted PE ratios, Telecom Corporation of New Zealand is the most undervalued firm in this group and Telecom unicaciones de Chile is the most overvalued firm.

Comparing PE Ratios across Firms in the Market In the preceding section, comparable firms were narrowly defined to be other firms in the same business. This section considers ways in which we can expand the number of comparable firms by looking at an entire sector or even the market. There are two advantages in doing this. The first is that the estimates may become more precise as the number of comparable firms increase. The second is that it allows you to pinpoint when firms in a small subgroup are being underor overvalued relative to the rest of the sector or the market. Since the differences across firms will increase when you loosen the definition of comparable firms, you have to adjust for these differences. The simplest way of doing this is with a multiple regression, with the PE ratio as the dependent variable, and proxies for risk, growth, and payout forming the independent variables.

Past Studies One of the earliest regressions of PE ratios against fundamentals across the entire market was done by Kisor and Whitbeck in 1963. Using data from the Bank of New York as of June 1962 for 135 stocks, they arrived at the following regression:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {P E} = 8. 2 + 1. 5 \text {(G r o w t h r a t e i n e a r n i n g s)} + 6. 7 \text {(P a y o u t r a t i o)} \\ - . 2 \text {(S t a n d a r d} \\ \end{array}
$$

Cragg and Malkiel followed up by estimating the coefficients for a regression of the price-earnings ratio on the growth rate, the payout ratio, and the beta for stocks for the time period from 1961 to 1965.

<table><tr><td>Year</td><td>Equation</td><td>R-Squared</td></tr><tr><td>1961</td><td>PE = 4.73 + 3.28 g + 2.05 π - 0.85 β</td><td>0.70</td></tr><tr><td>1962</td><td>PE = 11.06 + 1.75 g + 0.78 π - 1.61 β</td><td>0.70</td></tr><tr><td>1963</td><td>PE = 2.94 + 2.55 g + 7.62 π - 0.27 β</td><td>0.75</td></tr><tr><td>1964</td><td>PE = 6.71 + 2.05 g + 5.23 π - 0.89 β</td><td>0.75</td></tr><tr><td>1965</td><td>PE = 0.96 + 2.74 g + 5.01 π - 0.35 β</td><td>0.85</td></tr></table> where  $\mathrm{PE} =$  Price-earnings ratio at the start of the year

$\mathrm{g} =$  Growth rate in earnings

$\pi =$  Earnings payout ratio at the start of the year

$\beta =$  Beta of the stock

They concluded that while such models were useful in explaining PE ratios, they were of little use in predicting performance. In both these studies, the three variables used—payout, risk, and growth—represent the three variables that were identified as the determinants of PE ratios in an earlier section.

The regressions were updated from 1987 to 1991 in the first edition of this book using a much broader sample of stocks. The results are summarized as follows:

<table><tr><td>Year</td><td>Regression</td><td>R-Squared</td></tr><tr><td>1987</td><td>PE = 7.1839 + 13.05 Payout - 0.6259 Beta + 6.5659 EGR</td><td>0.9287</td></tr><tr><td>1988</td><td>PE = 2.5848 + 29.91 Payout - 4.5157 Beta + 19.9143 EGR</td><td>0.9465</td></tr><tr><td>1989</td><td>PE = 4.6122 + 59.74 Payout - 0.7546 Beta + 9.0072 EGR</td><td>0.5613</td></tr><tr><td>1990</td><td>PE = 3.5955 + 10.88 Payout - 0.2801 Beta + 5.4573 EGR</td><td>0.3497</td></tr><tr><td>1991</td><td>PE = 2.7711 + 22.89 Payout - 0.1326 Beta + 13.8653 EGR</td><td>0.3217</td></tr></table> where EGR is a historical growth rate in EPS. Note the volatility in the R-squared over time and the changes in the coefficients on the independent variables. For instance, the R-squared in the regressions reported declines from 0.93 in 1987 to

0.32 in 1991, and the coefficients change dramatically over time. Part of the reason for these shifts is that earnings are volatile, and price-earnings ratios reflect this volatility. The low R-squared for the 1991 regression can be ascribed to the recession's effects on earnings in that year. These regressions are clearly not stable, and the predicted values are likely to be noisy.

Updated Market Regressions The data needed to run market regressions is much more easily available today than it was for these earlier studies. In this section, the results of two regressions are presented. In the first regression, run in January 2011, the PE ratio was regressed against payout ratios, betas, and expected growth for all firms in the market:4

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {P E} = - 6. 3 7 + 8 3. 5 6 (\text {E x p e c t e d g r o w t h r a t e}) + 5. 0 6 (\text {B e t a}) + 5. 8 3 (\text {P a y o u t r a t i o}) \\ [ 5. 8 5 ] [ 1 6. 9 3 ] \quad [ 8. 1 8 ] \quad [ 4. 2 9 ] \\ R \text {- squared} = 19.8 \% \quad \text {Number of observations} = 1,608 \\ \end{array}
$$

With the sample size about 1,600 firms, this regression represents the broadest measure of relative value.

This regression has a low R-squared, but it is more a reflection of the noise in PE ratios than it is on the regression methodology. As you will see, the market regressions for price-to-book value and price-to-sales ratios tend to be better behaved and have a higher R-squared than PE ratio regressions. The other disquieting finding is that the coefficients on the variables do not always have the signs you would expect them to have. For instance, higher-risk stocks (higher betas) have higher PE ratios, when fundamentals would lead you to expect the opposite.

The coefficient on the expected growth rate in the regressions offers some useful insight into how the market is pricing growth differences across stocks. In the following table, we report this number each year from January 2000 to January 2011, in conjunction with the implied equity risk premiums that we computed in Chapter 7 (as a price of risk):

<table><tr><td>Time

${}^{1}$  Significant at 1\% level.

In January 2000, at the peak of the dot-com boom, the market was paying a very high price for growth, while charging very little for risk; not surprisingly, high-growth, high-risk firms traded at sky-high PE ratios. By January 2002, the wheel had turned, with the price for growth dropping by more than 50 percent and the price of risk increasing almost 80 percent. In January 2009, right after the banking crisis, the market price for risk was 6.43 percent (the highest level in 30 years), and the price paid for growth was low; the median PE ratio for U.S. firms was in single digits as a consequence.

Problems with the Regression Methodology The regression methodology is a convenient way of compressing large amounts of data into one equation capturing the relationship between PE ratios and financial fundamentals. But it does have its limitations. First, the independent variables are correlated with each other. For example, high-growth firms tend to have high risk and low payout ratios, as is clear from Table 18.2, which summarizes the correlations between beta, growth, and payout ratios for all U.S. firms. Note the negative correlation between payout ratios and growth, and the positive correlation between beta and growth. This multicollinearity makes the coefficients of the regressions unreliable (increased standard error) and may explain the wrong signs on the coefficients (such as beta having a positive coefficient) and the large changes in these coefficients from period to period. Second, the regression is based on a linear relationship between PE ratios and the fundamentals, and that might not be appropriate. An analysis of the residuals from a regression may suggest transformations of the independent variables (squared or natural logs) that work better in explaining PE ratios. Third, the basic relationship between PE ratios and financial variables itself is not stable, and if it shifts from year to year, the predictions from the regression equation may not be reliable for extended periods. For all these reasons, the regression approach is useful but it has to be viewed as one more tool in the search for true value.

# ILLUSTRATION 18.9: Valuing Procter & Gamble (P&G) Using the Market Regression

In an earlier illustration, we estimated a PE ratio for P&G from fundamentals. To value P&G using the broader regressions, you would first have to estimate the values, for P&G, of the independent variables in the regression:

P&G's beta = 0.90

P&G's payout ratio  $= 50.00\%$

P&G's expected growth rate  $= 10.00\%$

Note that these variables have been defined consistently with the variables in the regression. Thus, the growth rate over the next five years, the beta over the past five years, and the payout ratio over the most recent four quarters are used to make the prediction. Based on the price-earnings ratio regression for all stocks in the market, you would get a predicted PE ratio of:

$$
\begin{array}{r l} \text {P r e d i c t e d P E} _ {\mathrm {P} \& \mathrm {G}} & = 6. 3 7 + 8 3. 5 6 (\text {G r o w t h}) + 1 6. 4 4 (\text {B e t a}) + 5. 8 3 (\text {P a y o u t}) \\ & = 6. 3 7 + 8 3. 5 6 (0. 1 0) + 5. 8 3 (0. 9 0) + 5. 0 6 (0. 5 0) = 2 2. 5 0 \end{array}
$$

Based on the market regression, you would expect P&G to be trading at 22.50 times earnings. At its actual PE ratio of 18, the stock looks undervalued, relative to the market.

# NORMALIZING EARNINGS FOR PE RATIOS

The dependence of PE ratios on current earnings makes them particularly vulnerable to the year-to-year swings that often characterize reported earnings. In making comparisons, therefore, it may make much more sense to use normalized earnings. The process used to normalize earnings varies widely, but the most common approach is a simple averaging of earnings across time. For a cyclical firm, for instance, you would average the earnings per share across a cycle. In doing so, you should adjust for inflation. If you do decide to normalize earnings for the firm you are valuing, consistency demands that you normalize them for the comparable firms in the sample as well.

# THE PEG RATIO

Portfolio managers and analysts sometimes compare PE ratios to the expected growth rate to identify undervalued and overvalued stocks. In the simplest form of this approach, firms with PE ratios less than their expected growth rate are viewed as undervalued. In its more general form, the ratio of PE ratio to growth (PEG) is used as a measure of relative value, with a lower value believed to indicate that a firm is undervalued. For many analysts, especially those tracking firms in high-growth sectors, these approaches offer the promise of a way of controlling for differences in growth across firms, while preserving the inherent simplicity of a multiple.

# Definition of PEG Ratio

The PEG ratio is defined to be the price-earnings ratio divided by the expected growth rate in earnings per share:

For instance, a firm with a PE ratio of 20 and a growth rate of 10 percent is estimated to have a PEG ratio of 2. Consistency requires that the growth rate used in this estimate be the growth rate in earnings per share rather than operating income, because PEG ratio is an equity multiple.

Given the many definitions of the PE ratio, which one should you use to estimate the PEG ratio? The answer depends on the base on which the expected growth rate is computed. If the expected growth rate in earnings per share is based on earnings in the most recent year (current earnings), the PE ratio that should be used is the current PE ratio. If it is based on trailing earnings, the PE ratio used should be the trailing PE ratio. The forward PE ratio should never be used in this computation, since it may result in a double counting of growth. To see why, assume that you have a firm with a current price of  \$30 and current earnings per share of\$ 1.50. The firm is expected to double its earnings per share over the next year (forward earnings per share will be 3.00) and then have earnings growth of 5 percent a year for the following four years. An analyst estimating growth in earnings per share for this firm, with the current earnings per share as a base, will estimate a growth rate of 19.44\%:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {E x p e c t e d} = \left[ \left(1 + \text {G r o w t h} \text {r a t e} _ {\text {y e a r 1}}\right) \left(1 + \text {G r o w t h} \text {r a t e} _ {\text {y e a r s 2 - 5}}\right) ^ {4} \right] ^ {1 / 5} - 1 \\ = [ 2. 0 0 (1. 0 5) ^ {4} ] ^ {1 / 5} - 1 = . 1 9 4 4 \\ \end{array}
$$

If you used the forward PE ratio and this estimate of earnings growth to estimate the PEG ratio, you would get:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {P E G r a t i o} = \text {F o r w a r d P E / E x p e c t e d g r o w t h} _ {\text {n e x t 5 y e a r s}} \\ = (\text {P r i c e / F o r w a r d E P S}) / \text {E x p e c t e d g r o w t h} _ {\text {n e x t 5 y e a r s}} \\ = (\$ 30 / \$ 3) / 1 9. 4 4 = 0. 5 1 \\ \end{array}
$$

On a PEG ratio basis, this firm seems to be cheap. Note, however, that the growth in the first year has been counted twice—the forward earnings are high because of the doubling of earnings, leading to a low forward PE ratio, and the growth rate is high for the same reason. A consistent estimate of the PEG ratio would require using a current PE and the expected growth rate over the next five years:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {P E G r a t i o b a s o n} \mathrm {P E} = (\text {P r i c e / C u r r e n t E P S}) / \text {E x p e c t e d g r o w t h r a t e} _ {\text {n e x t 5 y e a r s}} \\ = (\$ 30 / \$ 1.50) / 19.44 = 1.03 \\ \end{array}
$$

Alternatively, you could compute the PEG ratio based on forward earnings per share and the growth rate from years 2 through 5:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {P E G r a t i o b a s e d o n f o r w a r d P E} = (\text {P r i c e / F o r w a r d E P S}) / \text {E x p e c t e d g r o w t h} _ {\text {y e a r s 2 - 5}} \\ = (\$ 30 / \$ 3) / 5 = 2. 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

If this approach is used, the PEG ratio would have to be estimated uniformly for all of the other comparable firms as well, using the forward PE and the expected growth rate from years 2 through 5.

Building on the theme of uniformity, the PEG ratio should be estimated using the same growth estimates for all firms in the sample. You should not, for instance, use five-year growth rates for some firms and one-year growth rates for others. One way of ensuring uniformity is to use the same source for earnings growth estimates
