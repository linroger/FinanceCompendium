# Understanding Financial Statements

Financial statements provide the fundamental information that we use to analyze and answer valuation questions. It is important, therefore, that we understand the principles governing these statements by looking at four questions:

1. How valuable are the assets of a firm? The assets of a firm can come in several forms—assets with long lives such as land and buildings, assets with shorter lives such as inventory, and intangible assets that nevertheless produce revenues for the firm such as patents and trademarks.
2. How did the firm raise the funds to finance these assets? In acquiring assets, firms can use the funds of the owners (equity) or borrowed money (debt), and the mix is likely to change as the assets age.
3. How profitable are these assets? A good investment is one that makes a return greater than the cost of funding it. To evaluate whether the investments that a firm has already made are good investments, we need to estimate what returns these investments are producing.
4. How much uncertainty (or risk) is embedded in these assets? While we have not yet directly confronted the issue of risk, estimating how much uncertainty there is in existing investments, and the implications for a firm, is clearly a first step.

This chapter looks at the way accountants would answer these questions, and why the answers might be different when doing valuation. Some of these differences can be traced to the differences in objectives: Accountants try to measure the current standing and immediate past performance of a firm, whereas valuation is much more forward-looking.

# THE BASIC ACCOUNTING STATEMENTS

There are three basic accounting statements that summarize information about a firm. The first is the balance sheet, shown in Figure 3.1, which summarizes the assets owned by a firm, the value of these assets, and the mix of financing (debt and equity) used to finance these assets at a point in time.

The next is the income statement, shown in Figure 3.2, which provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a period. The period can be a quarter (if it is a quarterly income statement) or a year (if it is an annual report).

Finally, there is the statement of cash flows, shown in Figure 3.3, which specifies the sources and uses of cash to the firm from operating, investing, and financing

# ASSET MEASUREMENT AND VALUATION

When analyzing any firm, we want to know the types of assets that it owns, the value of these assets, and the degree of uncertainty about this value. Accounting statements do a reasonably good job of categorizing the assets owned by a firm, a partial job of assessing the value of these assets, and a poor job of reporting uncertainty about asset value. This section begins by looking at the accounting principles underlying asset categorization and measurement, and the limitations of financial statements in providing relevant information about assets.

# Accounting Principles Underlying Asset Measurement

An asset is any resource that has the potential either to generate future cash inflows or to reduce future cash outflows. While that is a general definition broad enough to cover almost any kind of asset, accountants add a caveat that for a resource to be an asset a firm has to have acquired it in a prior transaction and be able to quantify future benefits with reasonable precision. The accounting view of asset value is to a great extent grounded in the notion of historical cost, which is the original cost of the asset, adjusted upward for improvements made to the asset since purchase and downward for the loss in value associated with the aging of the asset. This historical cost is called the book value. While the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for valuing an asset vary across different kinds of assets, three principles underlie the way assets are valued in accounting statements:

1. An abiding belief in book value as the best estimate of value. Accounting estimates of asset value begin with the book value, and unless a substantial reason is given to do otherwise, accountants view the historical cost as the best estimate of the value of an asset.
2. A distrust of market or estimated value. When a current market value exists for an asset that is different from the book value, accounting convention seems to view this market value with suspicion. The market price of an asset is often viewed as both much too volatile and too easily manipulated to be used as an estimate of value for an asset. This suspicion runs even deeper when a value is estimated for an asset based on expected future cash flows.
3. A preference for underestimating value rather than overestimating it. When there is more than one approach to valuing an asset, accounting convention takes the view that the more conservative (lower) estimate of value should be used rather than the less conservative (higher) estimate of value. Thus, when both market and book value are available for an asset, accounting rules often require that you use the lesser of the two numbers.

# Measuring Asset Value

The financial statement in which accountants summarize and report asset value is the balance sheet. To examine how asset value is measured, let us begin with the way assets are categorized in the balance sheet. First there are the fixed assets, which include the long-term assets of the firm, such as plant, equipment, land, and buildings. Next, we have the short-term assets of the firm, including inventory (raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods, receivables (summarizing moneys owed to the firm), and cash; these are categorized as current assets. We then have investments in the assets and securities of other firms, which are generally categorized as financial investments. Finally, we have what is loosely categorized as intangible assets. These include not only assets such as patents and trademarks that presumably will create future earnings and cash flows, but also uniquely accounting assets such as goodwill that arise because of acquisitions made by the firm.

Fixed Assets Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States require the valuation of fixed assets at historical cost, adjusted for any estimated loss in value from the aging of these assets. While in theory the adjustments for aging should reflect the loss of earning power of the asset as it ages, in practice they are much more a product of accounting rules and convention, and these adjustments are called depreciation. Depreciation methods can very broadly be categorized into straight line (where the loss in asset value is assumed to be the same every year over its lifetime) and accelerated (where the asset loses more value in the earlier years and less in the later years). While tax rules, at least in the United States, have restricted the freedom that firms have on their choices of asset life and depreciation methods, firms continue to have a significant amount of flexibility on these decisions for reporting purposes. Thus, the depreciation that is reported in the annual reports may not be, and generally is not, the same depreciation that is used in the tax statements.

Since fixed assets are valued at book value and are adjusted for depreciation provisions, the value of a fixed asset is strongly influenced by both its depreciable life and the depreciation method used. Many firms in the United States use straight-line depreciation for financial reporting while using accelerated depreciation for tax purposes, since firms can report better earnings with the former, at least in the years right after the asset is acquired. In contrast, firms in other countries often use accelerated depreciation for both tax and financial reporting purposes, leading to reported income that is understated relative to that of their U.S. counterparts.

Current Assets Current assets include inventory, cash, and accounts receivable. It is in this category that accountants are most amenable to the use of market value, especially in valuing marketable securities.

Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable represent money owed by entities to the firm on the sale of products on credit. When the Home Depot sells products to building contractors and gives them a few weeks to make their payments, it is creating accounts receivable. The accounting convention is for accounts receivable to be recorded as the amount owed to the firm based on the billing at the time of the credit sale. The only major valuation and accounting issue is when the firm has to recognize accounts receivable that are not collectible. Firms can set aside a portion of their income to cover expected bad debts from credit sales, and accounts receivable will be reduced by this reserve. Alternatively, the bad debts can be recognized as they occur, and the firm can reduce the accounts receivable accordingly. There is the danger, however, that absent a decisive declaration of a bad debt, firms may continue to show as accounts receivable amounts that they know are unlikely ever to be collected.

Cash Cash is one of the few assets for which accountants and financial analysts should agree on value. The value of a cash balance should not be open to estimation error. Having said this, we note that fewer and fewer companies actually hold cash in the conventional sense (as currency or as demand deposits in banks). Firms often invest the cash in interest-bearing accounts, commercial paper or in Treasuries so as to earn a return on their investments. In either case, market value can sometimes deviate from book value. While there is minimal default risk in either of these investments, interest rate movements can affect their value. The valuation of marketable securities is examined later in this section.

Inventory Three basic approaches to valuing inventory are allowed by GAAP: first in, first out (FIFO); last in, first out (LIFO); and weighted average.

1. First in, first out (FIFO). Under FIFO, the cost of goods sold is based on the cost of material bought earliest in the period, while the cost of inventory is based on the cost of material bought later in the year. This results in inventory being valued close to current replacement cost. During periods of inflation, the use of FIFO will result in the lowest estimate of cost of goods sold among the three valuation approaches, and the highest net income.
2. Last in, first out (LIFO). Under LIFO, the cost of goods sold is based on the cost of material bought toward the end of the period, resulting in costs that closely approximate current costs. The inventory, however, is valued on the basis of the cost of materials bought earlier in the year. During periods of inflation, the use of LIFO will result in the highest estimate of cost of goods sold among the three approaches, and the lowest net income.
3. Weighted average. Under the weighted average approach, both inventory and the cost of goods sold are based on the average cost of all material bought during the period. When inventory turns over rapidly, this approach will more closely resemble FIFO than LIFO.

Firms often adopt the LIFO approach for its tax benefits during periods of high inflation. The cost of goods sold is then higher because it is based on prices paid toward to the end of the accounting period. This, in turn, will reduce the reported taxable income and net income while increasing cash flows. Studies indicate that larger firms with rising prices for raw materials and labor, more variable inventory growth, and an absence of other tax loss carryforwards are much more likely to adopt the LIFO approach.

Given the income and cash flow effects of inventory valuation methods, it is often difficult to compare the profitability of firms that use different methods. There is, however, one way of adjusting for these differences. Firms that choose the LIFO approach to value inventories have to specify in a footnote the difference in inventory valuation between FIFO and LIFO, and this difference is termed the LIFO reserve. It can be used to adjust the beginning and ending inventories, and consequently the cost of goods sold, and to restate income based on FIFO valuation.

Investments (Financial) and Marketable Securities In the category of investments and marketable securities, accountants consider investments made by firms in the securities or assets of other firms, as well as other marketable securities, including Treasury bills or bonds. The way in which these assets are valued depends on the way the investment is categorized and the motive behind the investment. In general, an investment in the securities of another firm can be categorized as a minority passive investment, a minority active investment, or a majority active investment, and the accounting rules vary depending on the categorization.

Minority Passive Investments If the securities or assets owned in another firm represent less than 20 percent of the overall ownership of that firm, an investment is treated as a minority passive investment. These investments have an acquisition value, which represents what the firm originally paid for the securities, and often a market value. Accounting principles require that these assets be subcategorized into one of three groups—investments that will be held to maturity, investments that are available for sale, and trading investments. The valuation principles vary for each.

For an investment that will be held to maturity, the valuation is at historical cost or book value, and interest or dividends from this investment are shown in the income statement.

For an investment that is available for sale, the valuation is at market value, but the unrealized gains or losses are shown as part of the equity in the balance sheet and not in the income statement. Thus, unrealized losses reduce the book value of the equity in the firm, and unrealized gains increase the book value of equity.

For a trading investment, the valuation is at market value, and the unrealized gains and losses are shown in the income statement.

Firms are allowed an element of discretion in the way they classify investments and, subsequently, in the way they value these assets. This classification ensures that firms such as investment banks, whose assets are primarily securities held in other firms for purposes of trading, revalue the bulk of these assets at market levels each period. This is called marking to market, and provides one of the few instances in which market value trumps book value in accounting statements. Note, however, that this mark-to-market ethos did not provide any advance warning in 2008 to investors in financial service firms of the overvaluation of subprime and mortgage-backed securities.

Minority Active Investments If the securities or assets owned in another firm represent between 20 percent and 50 percent of the overall ownership of that firm, an investment is treated as a minority active investment. While these investments have an initial acquisition value, a proportional share (based on ownership proportion) of the net income and losses made by the firm in which the investment was made is used to adjust the acquisition cost. In addition, the dividends received from the investment reduce the acquisition cost. This approach to valuing investments is called the equity approach.

The market value of these investments is not considered until the investment is liquidated, at which point the gain or loss from the sale relative to the adjusted acquisition cost is shown as part of the earnings in that period.

Majority Active Investments If the securities or assets owned in another firm represent more than 50 percent of the overall ownership of that firm, an investment is treated as a majority active investment. In this case, the investment is no longer shown as a financial investment but is instead replaced by the assets and liabilities of the firm in which the investment was made. This approach leads to a consolidation of the balance sheets of the two firms, where the assets and liabilities of the two firms are merged and presented as one balance sheet.[2] The share of the equity in the subsidiary that is owned by other investors is shown as a minority interest on the liability side of the balance sheet. To provide an illustration, assume that Firm A owns  $60\%$  of Firm B. Firm A will be required to consolidate  $100\%$  of Firm B's revenues, earnings, and assets into its own financial statements and then show a liability (minority interest) reflecting the accounting estimate of value of the  $40\%$  of Firm B's equity that does not belong to it. A similar consolidation occurs in the other financial statements of the firm as well, with the statement of cash flows reflecting the cumulated cash inflows and outflows of the combined firm. This is in contrast to the equity approach used for minority active investments, in which only the dividends received on the investment are shown as a cash inflow in the cash flow statement.

Here again, the market value of this investment is not considered until the ownership stake is liquidated. At that point, the difference between the market price and the net value of the equity stake in the firm is treated as a gain or loss for the period.

Intangible Assets Intangible assets include a wide array of assets, ranging from patents and trademarks to goodwill. The accounting standards vary across intangible assets.

Patents and Trademarks Patents and trademarks are valued differently depending on whether they are generated internally or acquired. When patents and trademarks are generated from internal research, the costs incurred in developing the asset are expensed in that period, even though the asset might have a life of several accounting periods. Thus, the intangible asset is not valued in the balance sheet of the firm. In contrast, when an intangible asset is acquired from an external party, it is treated as an asset.

Intangible assets have to be amortized over their expected lives, with a maximum amortization period of 40 years. The standard practice is to use straight-line amortization. For tax purposes, however, firms are generally not allowed to amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with no specific lifetime, though recent changes in the tax law allow for some flexibility in this regard.

Goodwill Goodwill is the by-product of acquisitions. When a firm acquires another firm, the purchase price is first allocated to tangible assets, and the excess price is then allocated to any intangible assets such as patents or trade names. Any residual becomes goodwill. While accounting principles suggest that goodwill captures the value of any intangibles that are not specifically identifiable, it is really a reflection of the difference between the book value of assets of the acquired firm and the market value paid in the acquisition. This approach is called purchase accounting, and goodwill is amortized over time. Until 2000, firms that did not want to see this charge against their earnings often used an alternative approach called pooling accounting, in which the purchase price never shows up in the balance sheet. Instead, the book values of the two companies involved in the merger were aggregated to create the consolidated balance of the combined firm. The rules on acquisition accounting have changed substantially in the past decade both in the United States and internationally. Not only is purchase accounting required on all acquisitions, but firms are no longer allowed to automatically amortize goodwill over long periods (as they were used to doing). Instead, acquiring firms are required to reassess the values of the acquired entities every year; if the values have dropped since the acquisition, the value of goodwill must be reduced (impaired) to reflect the decline in value. If the acquired firm's values have gone up, though, the goodwill cannot be increased to reflect this change.

# ILLUSTRATION 3.1: Asset Values for Boeing and the Home Depot in 1998

The following table summarizes asset values, as measured in the balance sheets of Boeing, the aerospace giant, and the Home Depot, a building supplies retailer, at the end of the 1998 financial year (in millions of dollars):

<table><tr><td></td><td>Boeing</td><td>Home Depot</td></tr><tr><td>Net fixed assets</td><td>$8,589</td><td>$8,160</td></tr><tr><td>Goodwill</td><td>$2,312</td><td>$140</td></tr><tr><td>Investments and notes receivable</td><td>$41</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred income taxes</td><td>$411</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>Prepaid pension expense</td><td>$3,513</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>Customer financing</td><td>$4,930</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>Other assets</td><td>$542</td><td>$191</td></tr><tr><td>Current Assets</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>$2,183</td><td>$62</td></tr><tr><td>Short-term marketable investments</td><td>$279</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>Accounts receivables</td><td>$3,288</td><td>$469</td></tr><tr><td>Current portion of customer financing</td><td>$781</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred income taxes</td><td>$1,495</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>Inventories</td><td>$8,349</td><td>$4,293</td></tr><tr><td>Other current assets</td><td>$0</td><td>$109</td></tr><tr><td>Total current assets</td><td>$16,375</td><td>$4,933</td></tr><tr><td>Total assets</td><td>$36,672</td><td>$13,465</td></tr></table>

There are five points worth noting about these asset values:

1. Goodwill. Boeing, which acquired Rockwell in 1996 and McDonnell Douglas in 1997, used purchase accounting for the Rockwell acquisition and pooling for McDonnell Douglas. The goodwill on the balance sheet reflects the excess of acquisition value over book value for Rockwell and is being amortized over 30 years (which Boeing would not be able to do under current rules). With McDonnell Douglas, there is no recording of the premium paid on the acquisition among the assets, suggesting that the acquisition was structured to qualify for pooling, which would also not be allowed under current rules.
2. Customer financing and accounts receivable. Boeing often either provides financing to its customers to acquire its planes or acts as the lessor on the planes. Since these contracts tend to run over several years, the present value of the payments due in future years on the financing and the lease payments is shown as customer financing. The current portion of these payments is shown as accounts receivable. The Home Depot provides credit to its customers as well, but all these payments due are shown as accounts receivable, since they are all short-term.
3. Inventories. Boeing values inventories using the weighted average cost method, while the Home Depot uses the FIFO approach for valuing inventories.
4. Marketable securities. Boeing classifies its short-term investments as trading investments and records them at market value. The Home Depot has a mix of trading, available-for-sale, and held-to-maturity investments and therefore uses a mix of book and market value to value these investments.
5. Prepaid pension expense. Boeing records the excess of its pension fund assets over its expected pension fund liabilities as an asset on the balance sheet.

Finally, the balance sheet for Boeing fails to report the value of a very significant asset, which is the effect of past research and development (R&D) expenses. Since accounting convention requires that these be expensed in the year that they occur and not be capitalized, the research asset does not show up in the balance sheet. Chapter 9 considers how to capitalize research and development expenses and the effects on balance sheets.

# MEASURING FINANCING MIX

The second set of questions that we would like to answer, and would like accounting statements to shed some light on, relate to the mix of debt and equity used by the firm, and the current values of each. The bulk of the information about these questions is provided on the liabilities side of the balance sheet and the footnotes to it.

# Accounting Principles Underlying Liability and Equity Measurement

Just as with the measurement of asset value, the accounting categorization of liabilities and equity is governed by a set of fairly rigid principles. The first is a strict categorization of financing into either a liability or an equity based on the nature of the obligation. For an obligation to be recognized as a liability, it must meet three requirements:

1. The obligation must be expected to lead to a future cash outflow or the loss of a future cash inflow at some specified or determinable date.
2. The firm cannot avoid the obligation.
3. The transaction giving rise to the obligation has to have already happened.

In keeping with the earlier principle of conservatism in estimating asset value, accountants recognize as liabilities only cash flow obligations that cannot be avoided.

The second principle is that the values of both liabilities and equity in a firm are better estimated using historical costs with accounting adjustments, rather than with expected future cash flows or market value. The process by which accountants measure the value of liabilities and equities is inextricably linked to the way they value assets. Since assets are primarily valued at historical cost or at book value, both debt and equity also get measured primarily at book value. The next section examines the accounting measurement of both liabilities and equity.

# Measuring the Value of Liabilities and Equities

Accountants categorize liabilities into current liabilities, long-term debt, and long-term liabilities that are not debt or equity. Next, we will examine the way they measure each of these.

Current Liabilities Under current liabilities are categorized all obligations that the firm has coming due in the next year. These generally include:

- Accounts payable, representing credit received from suppliers and other vendors to the firm. The value of accounts payable represents the amounts due to these creditors. For this item, book and market values should be similar.
Short-term borrowing, representing short-term loans (due in less than a year) taken to finance the operations or current asset needs of the business. Here again, the value shown represents the amounts due on such loans, and the book and market values should be similar, unless the default risk of the firm has changed dramatically since it borrowed the money.

Short-term portion of long-term borrowing, representing the portion of the long-term debt or bonds that is coming due in the next year. Here again, the value shown is the actual amount due on these loans, and market and book values should converge as the due date approaches.

- Other short-term liabilities, which is a catchall component for any other short-term liabilities that the firm might have, including wages due to its employees and taxes due to the government.

Of all the items in the balance sheet, absent outright fraud, current liabilities should be the one for which the accounting estimates of book value and financial estimates of market value are closest.

Long-Term Debt Long-term debt for firms can take one of two forms. It can be a long-term loan from a bank or other financial institution, or it can be a long-term bond issued to financial markets, in which case the creditors are the investors in the bond. Accountants measure the value of long-term debt by looking at the present value of payments due on the loan or bond at the time of the borrowing. For bank loans, this will be equal to the nominal value of the loan. With bonds, however, there are three possibilities: When bonds are issued at par value, for instance, the value of the long-term debt is generally measured in terms of the nominal obligation created (i.e., principal due on the borrowing). When bonds are issued at a premium or a discount on par value, the bonds are recorded at the issue price, but the premium or discount is amortized over the life of the bond. As an extreme example, companies that issue zero coupon debt have to record the debt at the issue price, which will be significantly below the principal (face value) due at maturity. The difference between the issue price and the face value is amortized each period and is treated as a noncash interest expense that is tax deductible.

In all these cases, the value of debt is unaffected by changes in interest rates during the life of the loan or bond. Note that as market interest rates rise or fall, the present value of the loan obligations should decrease or increase. This updated market value for debt is not shown on the balance sheet. If debt is retired prior to maturity, the difference between book value and the amount paid at retirement is treated as an extraordinary gain or loss in the income statement.

Finally, companies that have long-term debt denominated in nondomestic currencies have to adjust the book value of debt for changes in exchange rates. Since exchange rate changes reflect underlying changes in interest rates, it does imply that this debt is likely to be valued much nearer to market value than is debt in the domestic currency.

Other Long-Term Liabilities Firms often have long-term obligations that are not captured in the long-term debt item. These include obligations to lessors on assets that firms have leased, to employees in the form of pension fund and health care benefits yet to be paid, and to the government in the form of taxes deferred. In the past two decades accountants have increasingly moved toward quantifying these liabilities and showing them as long-term liabilities.

Leases Firms often choose to lease long-term assets rather than buy them. Lease payments create the same kind of obligation that interest payments on debt create, and they must be viewed in a similar light. If a firm is allowed to lease a significant portion of its assets and keep it off its financial statements, a perusal of the statements will give a very misleading view of the company's financial strength. Consequently, accounting rules have been devised to force firms to reveal the extent of their lease obligations on their books.

There are two ways of accounting for leases. In an operating lease, the lessor (or owner) transfers only the right to use the property to the lessee. At the end of the lease period, the lessee returns the property to the lessor. Since the lessee does not assume the risk of ownership, the lease expense is treated as an operating expense in the income statement and the lease does not affect the balance sheet. In a capital lease, the lessee assumes some of the risks of ownership and enjoys some of the benefits. Consequently, the lease, when signed, is recognized both as an asset and as a liability (for the lease payments) on the balance sheet. The firm gets to claim depreciation each year on the asset and also deducts the interest expense component of the lease payment each year. In general, capital leases recognize expenses sooner than equivalent operating leases.

Since firms prefer to keep leases off the books and sometimes to defer expenses, they have a strong incentive to report all leases as operating leases. Consequently the Financial Accounting Standards Board has ruled that a lease should be treated as a capital lease if it meets any one of the following four conditions:

1. The lease life exceeds 75 percent of the life of the asset.
2. There is a transfer of ownership to the lessee at the end of the lease term.
3. There is an option to purchase the asset at a bargain price at the end of the lease term.
4. The present value of the lease payments, discounted at an appropriate discount rate, exceeds 90 percent of the fair market value of the asset.

The lessor uses the same criteria for determining whether the lease is a capital or operating lease and accounts for it accordingly. If it is a capital lease, the lessor records the present value of future cash flows as revenue and recognizes expenses. The lease receivable is also shown as an asset on the balance sheet, and the interest revenue is recognized over the term of the lease as paid.

From a tax standpoint, the lessor can claim the tax benefits of the leased asset only if it is an operating lease, though the tax code uses slightly different criteria for determining whether the lease is an operating lease.

Employee Benefits Employers can provide pension and health care benefits to their employees. In many cases, the obligations created by these benefits are extensive, and a failure by the firm to adequately fund these obligations needs to be revealed in financial statements.

Pension Plans In a pension plan, the firm agrees to provide certain benefits to its employees, either by specifying a defined contribution (wherein a fixed contribution is made to the plan each year by the employer, without any promises as to the benefits that will be delivered in the plan) or a defined benefit (wherein the employer promises to pay a certain benefit to the employee). In the latter case, the employer has to put sufficient money into the plan each period to meet the defined benefits.

Under a defined contribution plan, the firm meets its obligation once it has made the prespecified contribution to the plan. Under a defined benefit plan, the firm's obligations are much more difficult to estimate, since they will be determined by a number of variables, including the benefits that employees are entitled to, the prior contributions made by the employer and the returns they have earned, and the rate of return that the employer expects to make on current contributions. As these variables change, the value of the pension fund assets can be greater than, less than, or equal to pension fund liabilities (which include the present value of promised benefits). A pension fund whose assets exceed its liabilities is an overfunded plan, whereas one whose assets are less than its liabilities is an underfunded plan, and disclosures to that effect have to be included in financial statements, generally in the footnotes.

When a pension fund is overfunded, the firm has several options. It can withdraw the excess assets from the fund, it can discontinue contributions to the plan, or it can continue to make contributions on the assumption that the overfunding is a transitory phenomenon that could well disappear by the next period. When a fund is underfunded, the firm has a liability, though accounting standards require that firms reveal only the excess of accumulated pension fund liability over pension fund assets on the balance sheet.

Health Care Benefits A firm can provide health care benefits in either of two ways—by making a fixed contribution to a health care plan without promising specific benefits (analogous to a defined contribution plan) or by promising specific health benefits and setting aside the funds to provide these benefits (analogous to a defined benefit plan). The accounting for health care benefits is very similar to the accounting for pension obligations.

Deferred Taxes Firms often use different methods of accounting for tax and financial reporting purposes, leading to a question of how tax liabilities should be reported. Since accelerated depreciation and favorable inventory valuation methods for tax accounting purposes lead to a deferral of taxes, the taxes on the income reported in the financial statements will generally be much greater than the actual tax paid. The same principles of matching expenses to income that underlie accrual accounting suggest that the deferred income tax be recognized in the financial statements. Thus a company that pays taxes of  \$55,000 on its taxable income based on its tax accounting, and that would have paid taxes of\$ 75,000 on the income reported in its financial statements, will be forced to recognize the difference

(\ 20,000) as deferred taxes. Since the deferred taxes will be paid in later years, they will be recognized when paid.

It is worth noting that companies that actually pay more in taxes than the taxes they report in the financial statements create an asset called a deferred tax asset. This reflects the fact that the firm's earnings in future periods will be greater as the firm is given credit for the deferred taxes.

The question of whether the deferred tax liability is really a liability is an interesting one. On one hand, the firm does not owe the amount categorized as deferred taxes to any entity, and treating it as a liability makes the firm look more risky than it really is. On the other hand, the firm will eventually have to pay its deferred taxes, and treating the amount as a liability seems to be the conservative thing to do.

Preferred Stock When a company issues preferred stock, it generally creates an obligation to pay a fixed dividend on the stock. Accounting rules have conventionally not viewed preferred stock as debt because the failure to meet preferred dividends does not result in bankruptcy. At the same time, the fact that the preferred dividends are cumulative makes them more onerous than common equity. Thus, preferred stock is a hybrid security, sharing some characteristics with equity and some with debt.

Preferred stock is valued on the balance sheet at its original issue price, with any cumulated unpaid dividends added on. Convertible preferred stock is treated similarly, but it is treated as equity on conversion.

Equity The accounting measure of equity is a historical cost measure. The value of equity shown on the balance sheet reflects the original proceeds received by the firm when it issued the equity, augmented by any earnings made since (or reduced by losses, if any) and reduced by any dividends paid out during the period. While these three items go into what we can call the book value of equity, three other points need to be made about this estimate:

1. When companies buy back stock for short periods, with the intent of reissuing the stock or using it to cover option exercises, they are allowed to show the repurchased stock as treasury stock, which reduces the book value of equity. Firms are not allowed to keep treasury stock on the books for extended periods, and have to reduce their book value of equity by the value of repurchased stock in the case of stock buybacks. Since these buybacks occur at the current market price, they can result in significant reductions in the book value of equity.
2. Firms that have significant losses over extended periods or carry out massive stock buybacks can end up with negative book values of equity.
3. Relating back to the discussion of marketable securities, any unrealized gain or loss in marketable securities that are classified as available for sale is shown as an increase or a decrease in the book value of equity in the balance sheet.

As part of their financial statements, firms provide a summary of changes in shareholders' equity during the period, where all the changes that occurred to the accounting measure of equity value are summarized.

As a final point on equity, accounting rules still seem to consider preferred stock, with its fixed dividend, as equity or near-equity, largely because of the fact that preferred dividends can be deferred or cumulated without the risk of default. To the extent that there can still be a loss of control in the firm (as opposed to bankruptcy), we have already argued that preferred stock shares almost as many characteristics with unsecured debt as it does with equity.

# ILLUSTRATION 3.2: Measuring Liabilities and Equity in Boeing and the Home Depot in 1998

The following table summarizes the accounting estimates of liabilities and equity at Boeing and the Home Depot for the 1998 financial year in millions of dollars:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Boeing</td><td>Home Depot</td></tr><tr><td>Accounts payable and other liabilities</td><td>$10,733</td><td>$1,586</td></tr><tr><td>Accrued salaries and expenses</td><td>0</td><td>\$1,010</td></tr><tr><td>Advances in excess of costs</td><td>$1,251</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>Taxes payable</td><td>$569</td><td>$247</td></tr><tr><td>Short-term debt and current long-term debt</td><td>$869</td><td>$14</td></tr><tr><td>Total current liabilities</td><td>$13,422</td><td>$2,857</td></tr><tr><td>Accrued health care benefits</td><td>\$4,831</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Other long-term liabilities</td><td>0</td><td>\$210</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred income taxes</td><td>0</td><td>\$83</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term debt</td><td>$6,103</td><td>$1,566</td></tr><tr><td>Minority interests</td><td>$9</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>Shareholders’ Equity</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Par value</td><td>$5,059</td><td>$37</td></tr><tr><td>Additional paid-in capital</td><td>$0</td><td>$2,891</td></tr><tr><td>Retained earnings</td><td>$7,257</td><td>$5,812</td></tr><tr><td>Total shareholders’ equity</td><td>$12,316</td><td>$8,740</td></tr><tr><td>Total liabilities</td><td>$36,672</td><td>$13,465</td></tr></table>

The most significant difference between the companies is the accrued health care liability shown by Boeing, representing the present value of expected health care obligations promised to employees in excess of health care assets. The shareholders' equity for both firms represents the book value of equity and is significantly different from the market value of equity. The following table summarizes the difference at the end of 1998 (in millions of dollars):

<table><tr><td></td><td>Boeing</td><td>Home Depot</td></tr><tr><td>Book value of equity</td><td>$12,316</td><td>$8,740</td></tr><tr><td>Market value of equity</td><td>$32,595</td><td>$85,668</td></tr></table>

One final point needs to be made about the Home Depot's liabilities. The Home Depot has substantial operating leases. Because these leases are treated as operating expenses, they do not show up in the balance sheet. Since they represent commitments to make payments in the future, we would argue that operating leases should be capitalized and treated as part of the liabilities of the firm. How best to do this is considered in Chapter 9.

# MEASURING EARNINGS AND PROFITABILITY

How profitable is a firm? What did it earn on the assets that it invested in? These are fundamental questions we would like financial statements to answer. Accountants use the income statement to provide information about a firm's operating activities over a specific time period. The income statement is designed to measure the earnings from assets in place. This section examines the principles underlying earnings and return measurement in accounting, and the way they are put into practice.

# Accounting Principles Underlying Measurement of Earnings and Profitability

Two primary principles underlie the measurement of accounting earnings and profitability. The first is the principle of accrual accounting. In accrual accounting, the revenue from selling a good or service is recognized in the period in which the good is sold or the service is performed (in whole or substantially). A corresponding effort is made on the expense side to match expenses to revenues. This is in contrast to a cash-based system of accounting, where revenues are recognized when payment is received and expenses are recorded when paid.

The second principle is the categorization of expenses into operating, financing, and capital expenses. Operating expenses are expenses that, at least in theory, provide benefits only for the current period; the cost of labor and materials expended to create products that are sold in the current period is a good example. Financing expenses are expenses arising from the nonequity financing used to raise capital for the business; the most common example is interest expenses. Capital expenses are expenses that are expected to generate benefits over multiple periods; for instance, the cost of buying land and buildings is treated as a capital expense.

Operating expenses are subtracted from revenues in the current period to arrive at a measure of operating earnings of the firm. Financing expenses are subtracted from operating earnings to estimate earnings to equity investors or net income. Capital expenses are written off over their useful lives (in terms of generating benefits) as depreciation or amortization.

# Measuring Accounting Earnings and Profitability

Since income can be generated from a number of different sources, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require that income statements be classified into four sections—income from continuing operations, income from discontinued operations, extraordinary gains or losses, and adjustments for changes in accounting principles.

Generally accepted accounting principles require the recognition of revenues when the service for which the firm is getting paid has been performed in full or substantially, and the firm has received in return either cash or a receivable that is both observable and measurable. Expenses linked directly to the production of revenues (like labor and materials) are recognized in the same period in which revenues are recognized. Any expenses that are not directly linked to the production of revenues are recognized in the period in which the firm consumes the services. Accounting has resolved one inconsistency that bedeviled it for years, with a change in the way it treats employee options. Unlike the old rules, these option grants were not treated as expenses when granted but only when exercised, the new rules require that employee options be valued and expensed, when granted (with allowances for amortization over periods). Since employee options are part of compensation, which is an operating expense, the new rules make more sense.

While accrual accounting is straightforward in firms that produce goods and sell them, there are special cases where accrual accounting can be complicated by the nature of the product or service being offered. For instance, firms that enter into long-term contracts with their customers are allowed to recognize revenue on the basis of the percentage of the contract that is completed. As the revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis, a corresponding proportion of the expense is also recognized. When there is considerable uncertainty about the capacity of the buyer of a good or service to pay for it, the firm providing the good or service may recognize the income only when it collects portions of the selling price under the installment method.

Reverting back to the discussion of the difference between capital and operating expenses, operating expenses should reflect only those expenses that create revenues in the current period. In practice, however, a number of expenses are classified as operating expenses that do not seem to meet this test. The first is depreciation and amortization. While the notion that capital expenditures should be written off over multiple periods is reasonable, the accounting depreciation that is computed on the original historical cost often bears little resemblance to the actual economic depreciation. The second expense is research and development expenses, which accounting standards classify as operating expenses, but which clearly provide benefits over multiple periods. The rationale used for this classification is that the benefits cannot be counted on or easily quantified.

Much of financial analysis is built around the expected future earnings of a firm, and many of these forecasts start with the current earnings. It is therefore important to know how much of these earnings comes from the ongoing operations of the firm and how much can be attributed to unusual or extraordinary events that are unlikely to recur on a regular basis. From that standpoint, it is useful that firms categorize expenses into operating and nonrecurring expenses, since it is the earnings prior to extraordinary items that should be used in forecasting. Nonrecurring items include:

Unusual or infrequent items, such as gains or losses from the divestiture of an asset or division, and write-offs or restructuring costs. Companies sometimes include such items as part of operating expenses. As an example, Boeing in 1997 took a write-off of 1,400 million to adjust the value of assets it acquired in its acquisition of McDonnell Douglas, and it showed this as part of operating expenses.

Extraordinary items, which are defined as events that are unusual in nature, infrequent in occurrence, and material in impact. Examples include the accounting gain associated with refinancing high-coupon debt with lower-coupon debt, and gains or losses from marketable securities that are held by the firm.

■ Losses associated with discontinued operations, which measure both the loss from the phaseout period and any estimated loss on sale of the operations. To qualify, however, the operations have to be separable from the firm.

Gains or losses associated with accounting changes, which measure earnings changes created by both accounting changes made voluntarily by the firm (such as a change in inventory valuation) and accounting changes mandated by new accounting standards.

# ILLUSTRATION 3.3: Measures of Earnings—Boeing and the Home Depot in 1998

The following table summarizes the income statements of Boeing and the Home Depot for the 1998 financial year:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Boeing(in $ millions)</td><td>Home Depot(in $ millions)</td></tr><tr><td>Sales and other operating revenues</td><td>$56,154</td><td>$30,219</td></tr><tr><td>– Operating costs and expenses</td><td>$51,022</td><td>$27,185</td></tr><tr><td>– Depreciation</td><td>$1,517</td><td>$373</td></tr><tr><td>– Research and development expenses</td><td>$1,895</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>Operating income</td><td>$1,720</td><td>$2,661</td></tr><tr><td>+ Other income (includes interest income)</td><td>$130</td><td>$30</td></tr><tr><td>– Interest expenses</td><td>$453</td><td>$37</td></tr><tr><td>Earnings before taxes</td><td>$1,397</td><td>$2,654</td></tr><tr><td>– Income taxes</td><td>$277</td><td>$1,040</td></tr><tr><td>Net earnings (Loss)</td><td>$1,120</td><td>$1,614</td></tr></table>

Boeing's operating income is reduced by the research and development expense, which is treated as an operating expense by accountants. The Home Depot's operating expenses include operating leases. As noted earlier, the treatment of both these items skews earnings, and how best to adjust earnings when such expenses exist is considered in Chapter 9.

Measures of Profitability While the income statement allows us to estimate how profitable a firm is in absolute terms, it is just as important that we gauge the profitability of the firm in terms of percentage returns. Two basic ratios measure profitability. One examines the profitability relative to the capital employed to get a rate of return on investment. This can be done either from the viewpoint of just the equity investors or by looking at the entire firm. Another examines profitability relative to sales, by estimating a profit margin.

Return on Assets and Return on Capital The return on assets (ROA) of a firm measures its operating efficiency in generating profits from its assets, prior to the effects of financing.

Return on assets = Earnings before interest and taxes(1 - Tax rate)/Total assets

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is the accounting measure of operating income from the income statement, and total assets refers to the assets as measured using accounting rules—that is, using book value (BV) for most assets. Alternatively, return on assets can be written as:

Return on assets = [Net income + Interest expenses(1 - Tax rate)]/Total assets

By separating the financing effects from the operating effects, the return on assets provides a cleaner measure of the true return on these assets. By dividing by total assets, the return on assets does understate the profitability of firms that have substantial current assets.

ROA can also be computed on a pretax basis with no loss of generality, by using the earnings before interest and taxes and not adjusting for taxes:

Pretax ROA = Earnings before interest and taxes/Total assets

This measure is useful if the firm or division is being evaluated for purchase by an acquirer with a different tax rate.

A more useful measure of return relates the operating income to the capital invested in the firm, where capital is defined as the sum of the book value of debt and equity, net of cash. This is the return on invested capital (ROC or ROIC), and provides not only a truer measure of return but one that can be compared to the cost of capital, to measure the quality of a firm's investments.

$$
\text {R e t u r n o n i n v e s t e d c a p i t a l} = \frac {\mathrm {E B I T} (1 - \mathrm {t})}{\mathrm {B V} \text {o f} \mathrm {d e b t} + \mathrm {B V} \text {o f} \text {e q u i t y} - \mathrm {C a s h}}
$$

The denominator is generally termed invested capital and measures the book value of operating assets. For both measures, the book value can be measured at the beginning of the period or as an average of beginning and ending values.

# ILLUSTRATION 3.4: Estimating Return on Capital—Boeing and the Home Depot in 1998

The following table summarizes the after-tax return on assets and return on capital estimates for Boeing and the Home Depot, using both average and beginning measures of capital in 1998:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Boeing(in $millions)</td><td>Home Depot(in $millions)</td></tr><tr><td>After-tax operating income</td><td>$1,118</td><td>$1,730</td></tr><tr><td>Book value of capital—beginning</td><td>$19,807</td><td>$8,525</td></tr><tr><td>Book value of capital—ending</td><td>$19,288</td><td>$10,320</td></tr><tr><td>Book value of capital—average</td><td>$19,548</td><td>$9,423</td></tr><tr><td>Return on capital (based on average)</td><td>5.72\%</td><td>18.36\%</td></tr><tr><td>Return on capital (based on beginning)</td><td>5.64\%</td><td>20.29\%</td></tr></table>

Boeing had a terrible year, in 1998, in terms of after-tax returns. The Home Depot had a much better year in terms of those same returns.

Decomposing Return on Capital The return on capital of a firm can be written as a function of the operating profit margin it has on its sales, and its capital turnover ratio.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {R O C} = \frac {\mathrm {E B I T} (1 - t)}{\mathrm {B V} \text {o f c a p i t a l}} \\ = \frac {\mathrm {E B I T} (1 - t)}{\text {S a l e s}} \times \frac {\text {S a l e s}}{\text {B V o f c a p i t a l}} \\ = \text {A f t e r - t a x o p e r a t i n g m a r i n g} \times \text {C a p i t a l t u r n o v e r r a t i o} \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus, a firm can arrive at a high ROC by either increasing its profit margin or utilizing its capital more efficiently to increase sales. There are likely to be competitive constraints and technological constraints on both variables, but a firm still has some freedom within these constraints to choose the mix of profit margin and capital turnover that maximizes its ROC. The return on capital varies widely across firms in different businesses, largely as a consequence of differences in profit margins and capital turnover ratios.

Return on Equity While the return on capital measures the profitability of the overall firm, the return on equity (ROE) examines profitability from the perspective of the equity investor, by relating the equity investor's profits (net profit after taxes and interest expenses) to the book value of the equity investment.

$$
\text {R e t u r n o n e q u i t y} = \frac {\text {N e t i n c o m e}}{\text {B o o k v a l u e o f c o m m o n e q u i t y}}
$$

Since preferred stockholders have a different type of claim on the firm than do common stockholders, the net income should be estimated after preferred dividends, and the book value should be that of only common equity.

Determinants of Noncash ROE Since the ROE is based on earnings after interest payments, it is affected by the financing mix the firm uses to fund its projects. In general, a firm that borrows money to finance projects and that earns a ROC on those projects that exceeds the after-tax interest rate it pays on its debt will be able to increase its ROE by borrowing. The return on equity, not including cash, can be written as follows:7

$$
\mathrm {R O E} = \mathrm {R O C} + \frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {E}} \left[ \mathrm {R O C} - \mathrm {i} (1 - \mathrm {t}) \right]
$$ where  $\mathrm{ROC} = \mathrm{EBIT}(1 - t) / (\mathrm{BV}$  of debt  $^+$  BV of equity-Cash)  $\mathrm{D / E} = \mathrm{BV}$  of debt/BV of equity i  $=$  Interest expense on debt/BV of debt  $\mathfrak{t} =$  Tax rate on ordinary income


The second term captures the benefit of financial leverage.

Note that a tax rate of  $35\%$  is used on both the return on capital and the book interest rate. This approach results in a return on equity that is different from the one estimated using the net income and the book value of equity.

# MEASURING RISK

How risky are the investments the firm has made over time? How much risk do equity investors in a firm face? These are two more questions that we would like to find the answers to in the course of an investment analysis. Accounting statements do not really claim to measure or quantify risk in a systematic way, other than to provide footnotes and disclosures where there might be risk embedded in the firm. This section examines some of the ways in which accountants try to assess risk.

# Accounting Principles Underlying Risk Measurement

To the extent that accounting statements and ratios do attempt to measure risk, there seem to be two common themes.

The first is that the risk being measured is the risk of default—that is, the risk that a fixed obligation, such as interest or principal due on outstanding debt, will not be met. The broader equity notion of risk, which measures the variance of actual returns around expected returns, does not seem to receive much attention.

Thus, an all-equity-financed firm with positive earnings and few or no fixed obligations will generally emerge as a low-risk firm from an accounting standpoint, in spite of the fact that its earnings are unpredictable.

The second theme is that accounting risk measures generally take a static view of risk, by looking at the capacity of a firm at a point in time to meet its obligations. For instance, when ratios are used to assess a firm's risk, the ratios are almost always based on one period's income statement and balance sheet.

# Accounting Measures of Risk

Accounting measures of risk can be broadly categorized into two groups. The first is disclosures about potential obligations or losses in values that show up as footnotes on balance sheets, which are designed to alert potential or current investors to the possibility of significant losses. The second measure is ratios that are designed to measure both liquidity and default risk.

Disclosures in Financial Statements In recent years, the disclosures that firms have to make about future obligations have proliferated. Consider, for instance, the case of contingent liabilities. These refer to potential liabilities that will be incurred under certain contingencies, as is the case, for instance, when a firm is the defendant in a lawsuit. The general rule that has been followed is to ignore contingent liabilities that hedge against risk, since the obligations on the contingent claim will be offset by benefits elsewhere.[8] In recent periods, however, significant losses borne by firms from supposedly hedged derivatives positions (such as options and futures) have led to FASB requirements that these derivatives be disclosed as part of a financial statement. In fact, pension fund and health care obligations have moved from mere footnotes to actual liabilities for firms.

Financial Ratios Financial statements have long been used as the basis for estimating financial ratios that measure profitability, risk, and leverage. Earlier, the section on earnings looked at two of the profitability ratios—return on equity and return on capital. This section looks at some of the financial ratios that are often used to measure the financial risk in a firm.

Short-Term Liquidity Risk Short-term liquidity risk arises primarily from the need to finance current operations. To the extent that the firm has to make payments to its suppliers before it gets paid for the goods and services it provides, there is a cash shortfall that has to be met, usually through short-term borrowing. Though this financing of working capital needs is done routinely in most firms, financial ratios have been devised to keep track of the extent of the firm's exposure to the risk that it will not be able to meet its short-term obligations. The two ratios most frequently used to measure short-term liquidity risk are the current ratio and the quick ratio.

Current Ratios The current ratio is the ratio of the firm's current assets (cash, inventory, accounts receivable) to its current liabilities (obligations coming due within the next period).

$$

\text {C u r r e n t} = \frac {\text {C u r r e n t a s s e t s}}{\text {C u r r e n t l i a b i l i t i e s}}

$$

A current ratio below 1, for instance, would indicate that the firm has more obligations coming due in the next year than assets it can expect to turn into cash. That would be an indication of liquidity risk.

While traditional analysis suggests that firms maintain a current ratio of 2 or greater, there is a trade-off here between minimizing liquidity risk and tying up more and more cash in net working capital (Net working capital = Current assets - Current liabilities). In fact, it can be reasonably argued that a very high current ratio is indicative of an unhealthy firm that is having problems reducing its inventory. In recent years firms have worked at reducing their current ratios and managing their net working capital better.

Reliance on current ratios has to be tempered by a few concerns. First, the ratio can be easily manipulated by firms around the time of financial reporting dates to give the illusion of safety; second, current assets and current liabilities can change by an equal amount, but the effect on the current ratio will depend on its level before the change.[9]

Quick or Acid Test Ratios The quick or acid test ratio is a variant of the current ratio. It distinguishes current assets that can be converted quickly into cash (cash, marketable securities) from those that cannot (inventory, accounts receivable).

$$

\text {Q u i c k r a t i o} = \frac {\text {C a s h} + \text {M a r k e t a b l e s e c u r i t i e s}}{\text {C u r r e n t l i a b i l i t i e s}}

$$

The exclusion of accounts receivable and inventory is not a hard-and-fast rule. If there is evidence that either can be converted into cash quickly, it can, in fact, be included as part of the quick ratio.

Turnover Ratios Turnover ratios measure the efficiency of working capital management by looking at the relationship of accounts receivable and inventory to sales and to the cost of goods sold:

Accounts receivable turnover  $=$  Sales/Average accounts receivable Inventory turnover  $=$  Cost of goods sold/Average invent

These statistics can be interpreted as measuring the speed with which the firm turns accounts receivable into cash or inventory into sales. These ratios are often expressed in terms of the number of days outstanding:

Days accounts receivable outstanding  $= 365$ /Accounts receivable turnover
Days inventory held  $= 365$ /Inventory turnover

A similar pair of statistics can be computed for accounts payable, relative to purchases:

Accounts payable turnover  $=$  Purchases/Average accounts payable Days accounts payable outstanding  $= 365$ /Accounts payable turnover

Since accounts receivable and inventory are assets, and accounts payable is a liability, these three statistics (standardized in terms of days outstanding) can be combined to get an estimate of how much financing the firm needs to raise to fund working capital needs.

Required financing period  $=$  Days accounts receivable outstanding

+ Days inventory held
- Days accounts payable outstanding

The greater the financing period for a firm, the greater is its short-term liquidity risk.

Long-Term Solvency and Default Risk Measures of long-term solvency attempt to examine a firm's capacity to meet interest and principal payments in the long term. Clearly, the profitability ratios discussed earlier in the section are a critical component of this analysis. The ratios specifically designed to measure long-term solvency try to relate profitability to the level of debt payments in order to identify the degree of comfort with which the firm can meet these payments.

Interest Coverage Ratios The interest coverage ratio measures the capacity of the firm to meet interest payments from predebt, pretax earnings.

$$

\text {I n t e r e s t c o v e r a g e r a t i o} = \frac {\text {E B I T}}{\text {I n t e r e s t e x p e n s e s}}

$$

The higher the interest coverage ratio, the more secure is the firm's capacity to make interest payments from earnings. This argument, however, has to be tempered by the recognition that the amount of earnings before interest and taxes is volatile and can drop significantly if the economy enters a recession. Consequently, two firms can have the same interest coverage ratio but be viewed very differently in terms of risk.

The denominator in the interest coverage ratio can be easily extended to cover other fixed obligations such as lease payments. If this is done, the ratio is called a fixed charges coverage ratio:

$$

\text {F i x e d c h a r g e s c o v e r a g e r a t i o} = \frac {\text {E B I T (b e f o r e f i x e d c h a r g e s)}}{\text {F i x e d c h a r g e s}}

$$

Finally, this ratio, while stated in terms of earnings, can be restated in terms of cash flows by using earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in the numerator and cash fixed charges in the denominator.

$$

\text {C a s h f i x e d c h a r g e s c o v e r a g e r a t i o} = \frac {\text {E B I T D A}}{\text {C a s h f i x e d c h a r g e s}}

$$

Both interest coverage and fixed charges coverage ratios are open to the criticism that they do not consider capital expenditures, a cash flow that may be discretionary in the very short term, but not in the long term if the firm wants to maintain growth. One way of capturing the extent of this cash flow, relative to operating cash flows, is to compute a ratio of the two:

$$

\text {O p e r a t i n g c a s h f l o w t o c a p i t a l e x p e d i t u t e r s} = \frac {\text {C a s h f l o w s f r o m o p e r a t i o n s}}{\text {C a p i t a l e x p e d i t u t e r s}}

$$

While there are a number of different definitions of cash flows from operations, the most reasonable way of defining it is to measure the cash flows from continuing operations, before interest but after taxes and after meeting working capital needs.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Boeing</td><td>Home Depot</td></tr><tr><td>EBIT</td><td>$1,720</td><td>$2,661</td></tr><tr><td>Interest expense</td><td>$453</td><td>$37</td></tr><tr><td>Interest coverage ratio</td><td>3.80</td><td>71.92</td></tr><tr><td>EBIT</td><td>$1,720</td><td>$2,661</td></tr><tr><td>Operating lease expenses</td><td>$215</td><td>$290</td></tr><tr><td>Interest expenses</td><td>$453</td><td>$37</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed charges coverage ratio</td><td>2.90</td><td>9.02</td></tr><tr><td>EBITDA</td><td>$3,341</td><td>$3,034</td></tr><tr><td>Cash fixed charges</td><td>$668</td><td>$327</td></tr><tr><td>Cash fixed charges coverage ratio</td><td>5.00</td><td>9.28</td></tr><tr><td>Cash flows from operations</td><td>$2,161</td><td>$1,662</td></tr><tr><td>Capital expenditures</td><td>$1,584</td><td>$2,059</td></tr><tr><td>Cash flows/Capital expenditures</td><td>1.36</td><td>0.81</td></tr></table>

Boeing, based on its operating income in 1998, looks riskier than the Home Depot on both the interest coverage ratio basis and fixed charges coverage ratio basis. On a cash flow basis, however, Boeing does look much better. In fact, when capital expenditures are considered, the Home Depot has a lower ratio. For Boeing, the other consideration is the fact that operating income in 1998 was depressed relative to income in earlier years, and this does have an impact on the ratios across the board. It might make more sense when computing these ratios to look at the average operating income over time.

# finratio.xls: This spreadsheet allows you to compute the interest coverage and fixed charges coverage ratios for a firm based on financial statement data.

Debt Ratios Interest coverage ratios measure the capacity of the firm to meet interest payments, but do not examine whether it can pay back the principal on outstanding debt. Debt ratios attempt to do this, by relating debt to total capital or to equity:

$$

\text {D e b t} = \text {D e b t} / (\text {D e b t} + \text {E q u i t y})

$$

$$

\text {D e b t} = \text {D e b t / E q u i t y}

$$

The first ratio measures debt as a proportion of the total capital of the firm and cannot exceed 100 percent. The second measures debt as a proportion of the book value of equity in the firm and can be easily derived from the first, since:

$$

\text {D e b t} = \left(\text {D e b t / C a p i t a l}\right) / \left(1 - \text {D e b t / C a p i t a l}\right)

$$

While these ratios presume that capital is raised from only debt and equity, they can be easily adapted to include other sources of financing, such as preferred stock. Although preferred stock is sometimes combined with common stock under the equity label, it is better to keep the two sources of financing separate and to compute the ratio of preferred stock to capital (which will include debt, equity, and preferred stock).

There are two close variants of debt ratios. In the first, only long-term debt is used rather than total debt, with the rationale that short-term debt is transitory and will not affect the long-term solvency of the firm.

Long-term debt to capital ratio = Long-term debt/(Long-term debt + Equity)

Long-term debt to equity ratio  $=$  Long-term debt/Equity

Given the ease with which some firms can roll over short-term debt and the willingness of many firms to use short-term financing to fund long-term projects, these variants can provide a misleading picture of the firm's financial leverage risk.

The second variant of debt ratios uses market value (MV) instead of book value, primarily to reflect the fact that some firms have a significantly greater capacity to borrow than their book values indicate.

Market value debt to capital ratio  $=$  MV of debt/(MV of debt + MV of equity)

Market value debt to equity ratio  $=$  MV of debt/MV of equity

Many analysts disavow the use of market value in their calculations, contending that market values, in addition to being difficult to get for debt, are volatile and hence unreliable. These contentions are open to debate. It is true that the market value of debt is difficult to get for firms that do not have publicly traded bonds, but the market value of equity not only is easy to obtain, but it also is constantly updated to reflect marketwide and firm-specific changes. Furthermore, using the book value of debt as a proxy for market value in those cases where bonds are not traded does not significantly shift most market value-based debt ratios.[10]

# ILLUSTRATION 3.7: Book Value Debt Ratios and Variants—Boeing and the Home Depot

The following table summarizes different estimates of the debt ratio for Boeing and the Home Depot, in 2008, using book values of debt and equity for both firms:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Boeing(in $millions)</td><td>Home Depot(in $millions)</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term debt</td><td>$6,103</td><td>$1,566</td></tr><tr><td>Short-term debt</td><td>$869</td><td>$14</td></tr><tr><td>Book value of equity</td><td>$12,316</td><td>$8,740</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term debt/Equity</td><td>49.55\%</td><td>17.92\%</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term debt/(Long-term debt + Equity)</td><td>33.13\%</td><td>15.20\%</td></tr><tr><td>Debt/Equity</td><td>56.61\%</td><td>18.08\%</td></tr><tr><td>Debt/(Debt + Equity)</td><td>36.15\%</td><td>15.31\%</td></tr></table>

In 2008, Boeing has a much higher book value debt ratio, considering either long-term or total debt, than the Home Depot.

# OTHER ISSUES IN ANALYZING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

There are significant differences in accounting standards and practices across countries and these differences may color comparisons across companies.

# Differences in Accounting Standards and Practices

Differences in accounting standards across countries affect the measurement of earnings. These differences, however, are not so great as they are made out to be by some analysts, and they cannot explain away radical departures from fundamental principles of valuation. Choi and Levich, in a 1990 survey of accounting standards across developed markets, note that most countries subscribe to basic accounting notions of consistency, realization, and historical cost principles in preparing accounting statements. As countries increasingly move toward international financial reporting standards (IFRS), it is worth noting that IFRS and U.S. GAAP are more similar than dissimilar on many issues. It is true that there are areas of differences that still remain, and we note some of them in Table 3.1.

Most of these differences can be accounted and adjusted for when comparisons are made between companies in the United States and companies in other financial markets. Statistics such as price-earnings ratios, which use stated and unadjusted earnings, can be misleading when accounting standards vary widely across the companies being compared.

TABLE 3.1 Key Differences between IFRS and GAAP

<table><tr><td></td><td>IFRS</td><td>GAAP</td><td>Net Effect</td></tr><tr><td>Philosophy</td><td>Principle based.</td><td>Rules based.</td><td>Firms get more discretion under IFRS to make their own choices, resulting in more differences across firms.</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue recognition</td><td>Revenues are recognized only when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer of a product or service.</td><td>Revenues are recognized when evidence that the product or service has been delivered exists.</td><td>Revenue recognition may occur later in IFRS than in GAAP.</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term tangible assets</td><td>If a long-term asset is made up of multiple components, each component has to be capitalized and depreciated separately. Firms can choose to value an entire class of assets at market value, if there is a reliable and regular source of information for market value.</td><td>Asset can be capitalized and depreciated on a consolidated basis, based on an overall life for the assets.</td><td>Computing depreciation is more work under IFRS. Net effect on depreciation is unclear. IFRS can create mix of market- and book-based valuations for assets that vary across companies.</td></tr><tr><td>Short-term assets</td><td>Inventory is valued at lower of cost or net realizable value. No LIFO option for valuation.</td><td>Inventory is valued at lower of cost or market value. Choice of FIFO or LIFO.</td><td>Inventory is likely to be valued closer to current value under IFRS.</td></tr><tr><td>Long-Term liabilities</td><td>Convertible debt is broken down into debt and equity components, based on values.</td><td>Convertible debt is treated as debt, until conversion.</td><td>Debt ratios for companies with convertibles are lower under IFRS.</td></tr><tr><td>Consolidation</td><td>Consolidation required when you have effective control of an entity. Minority interest is a component of equity in balance sheet.</td><td>Consolidation required when you own 51\% of the voting rights of an entity. Minority interest is separated from equity in balance sheet.</td><td>More consolidation under IFRS rules than GAAP rules. Shareholders equity includes minority interest in IFRS.</td></tr><tr><td>Investments in other entities</td><td>Investment in securities can be classified as trading, available-for-sale, or held to maturity. Equity approach is required for investment in businesses.</td><td>All investments, including investments in companies, can be classified as trading, available for sale or held to maturity.

Only securities get marked to market under GAAP.</td></tr><tr><td>R&amp;D expenses</td><td>Research costs are expensed, but development costs can be capitalized, if technical and economic feasibility has been established.</td><td>Research and development costs are both expensed.</td><td>Companies that spend a significant amounts on R&amp;D will see increased book values for equity under IFRS.</td></tr></table>

# CONCLUSION

Financial statements remain the primary source of information for most investors and analysts. There are differences, however, between how accounting and financial analysts approach answering a number of key questions about the firm.

The first question relates to the nature and the value of the assets owned by a firm. Assets can be categorized into investments already made (assets in place) and investments yet to be made (growth assets); accounting statements provide a substantial amount of historical information about the former and very little about the latter. The focus on the original price of assets in place (book value) in accounting statements can lead to significant differences between the stated value of these assets and their market value. With growth assets, accounting rules result in low or no values for assets generated by internal research.

The second issue is the measurement of profitability. The two principles that govern how profits are measured are accrual accounting—in which revenues and expenses are shown in the period in which transactions occur rather than when the cash is received or paid—and the categorization of expenses into operating, financing, and capital expenses. While operating and financing expenses are shown in income statements, capital expenditures are spread over several time periods and take the form of depreciation and amortization. Accounting standards miscategorize operating leases and research and development expenses as operating expenses (when the former should be categorized as financing expenses and the latter as capital expenses).

Financial statements also deal with short-term liquidity risk and long-term default risk. While the emphasis in accounting statements is on examining the risk that firms may be unable to make payments that they have committed to make, there is very little focus on risk to equity investors.

1. Consider the assets on Coca-Cola's balance sheet and answer the following questions: a. Which assets are likely to be assessed closest to market value? Explain.

b. Coca-Cola has net fixed assets of 3,669 million. Can you estimate how much Coca-Cola paid for these assets? Is there any way to know the age of these assets?
c. Coca-Cola seems to have far more invested in current assets than in fixed assets. Is this significant? Explain.
d. In the early 1980s, Coca-Cola sold off its bottling operations, and the bottlers became independent companies. How would this action have impacted the assets on Coca-Cola's balance sheet? (The manufacturing plants are most likely to be part of the bottling operations.)

2. Examine the liabilities on Coca-Cola's balance sheet.

a. How much interest-bearing debt does Coca-Cola have outstanding? (You can assume that other short-term liabilities represent sundry payables, and other long-term liabilities represent health care and pension obligations.) b. How much did Coca-Cola obtain in equity capital when it issued stock originally to the financial markets?
c. Is there any significance to the fact that the retained earnings amount is much larger than the original paid-in capital?
d. The market value of Coca-Cola's equity is 140 billion. What is the book value of equity in Coca-Cola? Why is there such a large difference between the market value of equity and the book value of equity?

3. Coca-Cola's most valuable asset is its brand name. Where in the balance sheet do you see its value? Is there any way to adjust the balance sheet to reflect the value of this asset?
4. Assume that you have been asked to analyze Coca-Cola's working capital management.

a. Estimate the net working capital and noncash working capital for Coca-Cola.
b. Estimate the firm's current ratio.

Coca-Cola's income statements for 1997 and 1998 are summarized (in millions of dollars) for problems 5 through 9:

<table><tr><td></td><td>1997</td><td>1998</td></tr><tr><td>Net revenues</td><td>$18,868</td><td>$18,813</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of goods sold</td><td>6,015</td><td>5,562</td></tr><tr><td>Selling, general, and administrative expenses</td><td>7,852</td><td>8,284</td></tr><tr><td>Earnings before interest and taxes</td><td>5,001</td><td>4,967</td></tr><tr><td>Interest expenses</td><td>258</td><td>277</td></tr><tr><td>Nonoperating gains</td><td>1,312</td><td>508</td></tr><tr><td>Income tax expenses</td><td>1,926</td><td>1,665</td></tr><tr><td>Net income</td><td>4,129</td><td>3,533</td></tr><tr><td>Dividends</td><td>1,387</td><td>1,480</td></tr></table>

The following questions relate to Coca-Cola's income statements.

5. How much operating income did Coca-Cola earn, before taxes, in 1998? How does this compare to how much Coca-Cola earned in 1997? What are the reasons for the difference?
6. The biggest expense for Coca-Cola is advertising, which is part of the selling, generals and administrative (G&A) expenses. A large portion of these expenses is designed to build up Coca-Cola's brand name. Should advertising expenses be treated as operating expenses or are they really capital expenses? If they are to be treated as capital expenses, how would you capitalize them? (Use the capitalization of R&D as a guide.)
