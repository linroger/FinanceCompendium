# From Earnings to Cash Flows

The value of an asset comes from its capacity to generate cash flows. When valuing a firm, these cash flows should be after taxes, prior to debt payments, and after reinvestment needs. When valuing equity, the cash flows should be after debt payments. There are thus three basic steps to estimating these cash flows. The first is to estimate the earnings generated by a firm on its existing assets and investments, a process we examined in the preceding chapter. The second step is to estimate the portion of this income that would go toward paying taxes. The third is to develop a measure of how much a firm is reinvesting back for future growth.

This chapter examines the last two steps. It will begin by investigating the difference between effective and marginal taxes, as well as the effects of substantial net operating losses (NOLs) carried forward. To examine how much a firm is reinvesting, we will break it down into reinvestment in tangible and long-lived assets (net capital expenditures) and short-term assets (working capital). We will use a much broader definition of reinvestment to include investments in research and development (R&D) and acquisitions as part of capital expenditures.

# THE TAX EFFECT

To compute the after-tax operating income, you multiply the earnings before interest and taxes by an estimated tax rate. This simple procedure can be complicated by three issues that often arise in valuation. The first is the wide differences you observe between effective and marginal tax rates for these firms, and the choice you face between the two in valuation. The second issue arises usually with firms with large losses, leading to net operating losses that are carried forward and can save taxes in future years. The third issue arises from the capitalizing of research and development and other expenses. The fact that these expenditures can be expensed immediately leads to much higher tax benefits for the firm.

# Effective versus Marginal Tax Rate

You are faced with a choice of several different tax rates. The most widely reported tax rate in financial statements is the effective tax rate, which is computed from the reported income statement as follows:

Effective tax rate  $=$  Taxes due / Taxable income

The second choice on tax rates is the marginal tax rate, which is the tax rate the firm faces on its last dollar of income. This rate depends on the tax code and reflects what firms have to pay as taxes on their marginal income. In the United States, for instance, the federal corporate tax rate on marginal income is 35 percent; with the addition of state and local taxes, most profitable firms face a marginal corporate tax rate of 40 percent or higher.

While the marginal tax rates for most firms in the United States should be fairly similar, there are wide differences in effective tax rates across firms. Figure 10.1 provides a distribution of effective tax rates for moneymaking firms in the United States in January 2011. Note that a number of firms report effective tax rates of less than 10 percent as well as that a few firms have effective tax rates that exceed 50 percent. In addition, it is worth noting that this figure does not include about 2,000 firms that did not pay taxes during the most recent financial year (and most of these are money-losing companies) or that have a negative effective tax rate. $^{1}$

Reasons for Differences between Marginal and Effective Tax Rates Given that most of the taxable income of publicly traded firms is at the highest marginal tax bracket, why would a firm's effective tax rate be different from its marginal tax rate? There are at least four reasons:

1. Many firms, at least in the United States, follow different accounting standards for tax and for reporting purposes. For instance, firms often use straight-line depreciation for reporting purposes and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes. As a consequence, the reported income is significantly higher than the taxable income, on which taxes are based. $^2$

2. Firms sometimes use tax credits to reduce the taxes they pay. These credits, in turn, can reduce the effective tax rate below the marginal tax rate.
3. Firms can sometimes defer taxes on income to future periods. If firms defer taxes, the taxes paid in the current period will be at a rate lower than the marginal tax rate. In a later period, however, when the firm pays the deferred taxes, the effective tax rate will be higher than the marginal tax rate.
4. Firms that generate substantial income for foreign domiciles with lower tax rates do not have to pay domestic taxes until that income is repatriated back to the domestic country.

Marginal Tax Rates for Multinationals When a firm has global operations, its income is taxed at different rates in different locales. When this occurs, what is the marginal tax rate for the firm? There are three ways in which we can deal with different tax rates.

1. The first is to use a weighted average of the marginal tax rates, with the weights based on the income derived by the firm from each of these countries. The problem with this approach is that the weights will change over time, if income is growing at different rates in different countries.
2. The second is to use the marginal tax rate of the country in which the company is incorporated, with the implicit assumption being that the income generated in other countries will eventually have to be repatriated to the country of origin, at which point the firm will have to pay the marginal tax rate.
3. The third approach is to keep the income from each country separate and apply a different marginal tax rate to each income stream.

Effects of Tax Rate on Value In valuing a firm, should you use the marginal or the effective tax rates. If the same tax rate has to be applied to earnings every period, the safer choice is the marginal tax rate, because none of the four reasons noted can be sustained in perpetuity. As new capital expenditures taper off, the difference between reported and tax income will narrow; tax credits are seldom perpetual and firms eventually do have to pay their deferred taxes. There is no reason, however, why the tax rates used to compute the after-tax cash flows cannot change over time. Thus, in valuing a firm with an effective tax rate of 24 percent in the current period and a marginal tax rate of 35 percent, you can estimate the first year's cash flows using the marginal tax rate of 24 percent and then increase the tax rate to 35 percent over time. It is good practice to assume that the tax rate used in perpetuity to compute the terminal value be the marginal tax rate.

When valuing equity, we often start with net income or earnings per share, which are after-tax earnings. Although it looks as though we can avoid dealing with the estimating of tax rates when using after-tax earnings, appearances are deceptive. The current after-tax earnings of a firm reflect the taxes paid this year. To the extent that tax planning or deferral caused this payment to be very low (low effective tax rates) or very high (high effective tax rates), we run the risk of assuming that the firm can continue to do this in the future if we do not adjust the net income for changes in the tax rates in future years.

# ILLUSTRATION 10.1: Effect of Tax Rate Assumptions on Value

Convoy Inc. is a telecommunications firm that generated  $150 million in pretax operating income and reinvested$ 30 million in the most recent financial year. As a result of tax deferrals, the firm has an effective tax rate of 20\%, while its marginal tax rate is 40\%. Both the operating income and the reinvestment are expected to grow 10\% a year for five years, and 5\% thereafter. The firm's cost of capital is 9\% and is expected to remain unchanged over time. We will estimate the value of Convoy using three different assumptions about tax rates—the effective tax rate forever, the marginal tax rate forever, and an approach that combines the two rates.

# APPROACH 1: Effective Tax Rate Forever

We first estimate the value of Convoy assuming that the tax rate remains at  $20\%$  forever:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Tax Rate</td><td rowspan="2">20\%CurrentYear</td><td rowspan="2">20\%</td><td rowspan="2">20\%</td><td rowspan="2">20\%</td><td rowspan="2">20\%</td><td rowspan="2">20\%</td><td>20\%</td></tr><tr><td>TerminalYear</td></tr><tr><td>EBIT</td><td>$150.00</td><td>$165.00</td><td>$181.50</td><td>$199.65</td><td>$219.62</td><td>$241.58</td><td>$253.66</td></tr><tr><td>EBIT(1 - t)</td><td>$120.00</td><td>$132.00</td><td>$145.20</td><td>$159.72</td><td>$175.69</td><td>$193.26</td><td>$202.92</td></tr><tr><td>– Reinvestment</td><td>$ 30.00</td><td>$ 33.00</td><td>$ 36.30</td><td>$ 39.93</td><td>$ 43.92</td><td>$ 48.32</td><td>$ 50.73</td></tr><tr><td>Free cash flow to firm (FCFF)</td><td>$ 90.00</td><td>$ 99.00</td><td>$108.90</td><td>$119.79</td><td>$131.77</td><td>$144.95</td><td>$152.19</td></tr><tr><td>Terminal value</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>$3,804.83</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Present value</td><td></td><td>$ 90.83</td><td>$ 91.66</td><td>$ 92.50</td><td>$ 93.35</td><td>$2,567.08</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Firm value</td><td>2,935.42</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

This value is based on the implicit assumption that deferred taxes will never have to be paid by the firm.

# APPROACH 2: Marginal Tax Rate Forever

We next estimate the value of Convoy assuming that the tax rate is the marginal tax rate of  $40\%$  forever:

<table><tr><td>Tax Rate</td><td>20\%</td><td>40\%</td><td>40\%</td><td>40\%</td><td>40\%</td><td>40\%</td><td>40\%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Current Year</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>Year</td></tr><tr><td>EBIT</td><td>$150.00</td><td>$165.00</td><td>$181.50</td><td>$199.65</td><td>$219.62</td><td>$241.58</td><td>$253.66</td></tr><tr><td>EBIT(1 - t)</td><td>$120.00</td><td>$99.00</td><td>$108.90</td><td>$119.79</td><td>$131.77</td><td>$144.95</td><td>$152.19</td></tr><tr><td>– Reinvestment</td><td>$30.00</td><td>$33.00</td><td>$36.30</td><td>$39.93</td><td>$43.92</td><td>$48.32</td><td>$50.73</td></tr><tr><td>FCFF</td><td>$90.00</td><td>$66.00</td><td>$72.60</td><td>$79.86</td><td>$87.85</td><td>$96.63</td><td>$101.46</td></tr><tr><td>Terminal value</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>$2,536.55</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Present value</td><td></td><td>$60.55</td><td>$61.11</td><td>$61.67</td><td>$62.23</td><td>$1,711.39</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Firm value</td><td>1,956.94</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

This firm value is based on the implicit assumption that the firm cannot defer taxes from this point on. In fact, an even more conservative reading would suggest that we should reduce this value by the amount of the cumulated deferred taxes from the past. Thus, if the firm has  $200 million in deferred taxes from prior years, and expects to pay these taxes over the next four years in equal annual installments of$ 50 million, we would first compute the present value of these tax payments:

Present value of deferred tax payments = $50 million(PV of annuity, 9\%, 4 years) = $161.99 million

The value of the firm would then be 1,794.95 million.

# APPROACH 3: Blended Tax Rates

In the final approach, we will assume that the effective tax will remain  $20\%$  for five years and we will use the marginal tax rate to compute the terminal value:

<table><tr><td>Tax Rate</td><td>20\%</td><td>20\%</td><td>20\%</td><td>20\%</td><td>20\%</td><td>20\%</td><td>40\%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Current Year</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>Terminal Year</td></tr><tr><td>EBIT</td><td>$150.00</td><td>$165.00</td><td>$181.50</td><td>$199.65</td><td>$219.62</td><td>$241.58</td><td>$253.66</td></tr><tr><td>EBIT(1 - t)</td><td>$120.00</td><td>$132.00</td><td>$145.20</td><td>$159.72</td><td>$175.69</td><td>$193.26</td><td>$152.19</td></tr><tr><td>– Reinvestment</td><td>$30.00</td><td>$33.00</td><td>$36.30</td><td>$39.93</td><td>$43.92</td><td>$48.32</td><td>$50.73</td></tr><tr><td>FCFF</td><td>$90.00</td><td>$99.00</td><td>$108.90</td><td>$119.79</td><td>$131.77</td><td>$144.95</td><td>$101.46</td></tr><tr><td>Terminal value</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>$2,536.55</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Present value</td><td></td><td>$90.83</td><td>$91.66</td><td>$92.50</td><td>$93.35</td><td>$1,742.79</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Firm value</td><td>2,111.12</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

Note, however, that the use of the effective tax rate for the first five years will increase the deferred tax liability to the firm. Assuming that the firm ended the current year with a cumulated deferred tax liability of 200 million, we can compute the deferred tax liability by the end of the fifth year:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {E x p e c t e d} = \ 2 0 0 + (\$ 1 6 5 + \$ 1 8 1. 5 + \$ 1 9 9. 6 5 + \$ 2 1 9. 6 2 + \$ 2 4 1. 5 8) \\ \times (. 4 0 -. 2 0) = \$ 4 0 1. 4 7 \text {m i l l o n} \\ \end{array}
$$

We will assume that the firm will pay this deferred tax liability after year 5, but spread the payments over 10 years, leading to a present value of 167.45 million.

$$
\begin{array}{l} Present value of deferred tax payments = (\$ 401.47 / 10) (PV of annuity, 9 \%, 10 years) / 1.09 ^ {5} \\ = \$ 167.45 \text {m i l l o n} \\ \end{array}
$$

Note that the payments do not start until the sixth year, and hence get discounted back an additional five years. The value of the firm can then be estimated:

$$
\text {V a l u e o f f i r m} = \\mathbb {S} 2, 1 1 1. 1 2 - \mathbb {S} 1 6 7. 4 5 = \mathbb {S} 1, 9 4 3. 6 7 \text {m i l l i o n}
$$

# Effect of Net Operating Losses

For firms with large net operating losses carried forward or continuing operating losses, there is the potential for significant tax savings in the first few years that they generate positive earnings. There are two ways of capturing this effect.

One is to change tax rates over time. In the early years, these firms will have a zero tax rate, as losses carried forward offset income. As the net operating losses decrease, the tax rates will climb toward the marginal tax rate. As the tax rates used to estimate the after-tax operating income change, the rates used to compute the after-tax cost of debt in the cost of capital computation also need to change. Thus, for a firm with net operating losses carried forward, the tax rate used for both the computation of after-tax operating income and cost of capital will be zero during the years when the losses shelter income.

The other approach is often used when valuing firms that already have positive earnings but have a large net operating loss carried forward. Analysts will value the firm ignoring the tax savings generated by net operating losses, and then add to this amount the expected tax savings from net operating losses. Often, the expected tax savings are estimated by multiplying the tax rate by the net operating loss. The limitation of doing this is that it assumes that the tax savings are both guaranteed and instantaneous. To the extent that firms have to generate earnings to create these tax savings and there is uncertainty about earnings, it will overestimate the value of the tax savings.

There are two final points that need to be made about operating losses. To the extent that a potential acquirer can claim the tax savings from net operating losses sooner than the firm generating these losses, there can be potential for tax synergy that we examine in chapter 26, when we look at acquisitions. The other is that there are countries where there are significant limitations on how far forward operating losses can be taken. If this is the case, the value of these net operating losses may be reduced.

# ILLUSTRATION 10.2: The Effect of Net Operating Loss on Value: Tesla Motors

This illustration considers the effect of both net operating losses (NOLs) carried forward and expected losses in future periods on the tax rate for Tesla Motors, the electric car company, in 2011. Tesla reported an operating loss of  $65.5 million in 2010, on revenues of$ 116.74 million, and had an accumulated net operating loss of 140.64 million by the end of that year.

While things do look bleak for the firm, we will assume that revenues will grow significantly over the next decade and that the firm's operating margin will converge on the industry average of  $10\%$  for mature and healthy automobile firms. The following table summarizes our projections of revenues and operating income for Tesla for the next 10 years:

<table><tr><td>Year</td><td>Revenues</td><td>Operating Income or Loss</td><td>NOL at End of Year</td><td>Taxable Income</td><td>Taxes</td><td>Tax Rate</td></tr><tr><td>Current</td><td>$ 117</td><td>- $ 81</td><td>$141</td><td>$ 0</td><td>$ 0</td><td>0.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>$ 292</td><td>- $125</td><td>$266</td><td>$ 0</td><td>$ 0</td><td>0.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>$ 584</td><td>- $147</td><td>$413</td><td>$ 0</td><td>$ 0</td><td>0.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>$1,051</td><td>- $142</td><td>$555</td><td>$ 0</td><td>$ 0</td><td>0.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>$1,681</td><td>- $ 95</td><td>$650</td><td>$ 0</td><td>$ 0</td><td>0.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>$2,354</td><td>- $ 10</td><td>$661</td><td>$ 0</td><td>$ 0</td><td>0.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>$3,060</td><td>$ 93</td><td>$568</td><td>$ 0</td><td>$ 0</td><td>0.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>$3,672</td><td>$197</td><td>$371</td><td>$ 0</td><td>$ 0</td><td>0.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>$4,222</td><td>$292</td><td>$ 79</td><td>$ 0</td><td>$ 0</td><td>0.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>$4,645</td><td>$369</td><td>$ -</td><td>$289</td><td>$116</td><td>31.40\%</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>$4,877</td><td>$421</td><td>$ -</td><td>$421</td><td>168</td><td>40.00\%</td></tr></table>

Note that Tesla continues to lose money over the next five years, and adds to its net operating losses. In years 6, 7, and 8, its operating income is positive but it still pays no taxes because of its accumulated net operating losses from prior years. In year 9, it is able to reduce its taxable income by the remaining net operating loss ($79 million), but it begins paying taxes for the first time. We will assume a  $40\%$  tax rate and use this as our marginal tax rate after year 9. The benefits of the net operating losses are thus built into the cash flows and the value of the firm.

# The Tax Benefits of R&D Expensing

The preceding chapter argued that R&D expenses should be capitalized. If we decide to do so, however, there is a tax benefit that we might be missing. Firms are allowed to deduct their entire R&D expense for tax purposes. In contrast, they are allowed to deduct only the depreciation on their capital expenses. To capture the tax benefit, therefore, you would add the tax savings on the difference between the entire R&D expense and the amortized amount of the research asset to the after-tax operating income of the firm:

Additional tax benefit $_{\text{R&D expensing}} =$  (Current year's R&D expense)

- Amortization of research asset)  $\times$  Tax rate

A similar adjustment would need to be made for any other operating expense that you choose to capitalize. In Chapter 9, we noted that the adjustment to pretax operating income from capitalizing R&D is:

Adjusted operating earnings  $=$  Operating earnings + Current year's R&D expense

- Amortization of research asset

To estimate the after-tax operating income, we would multiply this value by (1 - Tax rate) and add on the additional tax benefit from before:

Adjusted after-tax operating earnings  $=$  (Operating earnings

+ Current year's R&D expense
- Amortization of research asset)
$\times (1 - \mathrm{Tax~rate})$
+ (Current year's R&D expense
- Amortization of research asset)  $\times$  Tax rate
= Operating earnings(1 - Tax rate)
+ Current year's R&D expense
- Amortization of research asset

In other words, the tax benefit from R&D expensing allows us to add the difference between R&D expense and amortization directly to the after-tax operating income (and to net income).

# ILLUSTRATION 10.3: Tax Benefit from Expensing: Amgen in 2011

In Chapter 9, we capitalize, R&D expenses for Amgen and estimated the value of the research asset to Amgen and adjusted operating income. Reviewing Illustration 9.2, we see the following adjustments:

Current year's R&D expense = 3,030 million

Amortization of research asset this year = 1,694 million

To estimate the tax benefit from expensing for Amgen, first assume that the tax rate for Amgen is  $35\%$  and note that Amgen can deduct the entire 3,030 million for tax purposes:

Tax deduction from R&D expense = R&D × Tax rate = 3,030 × .35 = 1,060.5 million

If only the amortization had been eligible for a tax deduction in 2010, the tax benefit would have been:

Tax deduction from R&D amortization = $1,694 million × .35 = $592.9 million

By expensing instead of capitalizing, Amgen was able to derive a much larger tax benefit. The differential tax benefit can be written as:

Thus, Amgen derives a tax benefit of 468 million because it can expense R&D expenses rather than capitalize them. Completing the analysis, we computed the adjusted after-tax operating income for Amgen. Note that in Illustration 9.2, we estimated the adjusted pretax operating income to be the following:

Adjusted pretax operating earnings = Operating earnings + Current year's R&D expense

- Amortization of research asset
$= 5,594 + 3,030 - 1,694 = \$  6,930$

You could convert this pretax operating income into an after-tax value and add back the tax benefit from R&D:

After-tax operating income = 6,930 (1 - .35) + 468 = \4,972 million

You can also arrive at the same answer by computing the unadjusted after-tax operating income and adjusting it for R&D:

Adjusted after-tax operating earnings  $=$  After-tax operating earnings + Current year's R&D expense

- Amortization of research asset

$= 5,594(1 - .35) + 3,030 - 1694 = \$  4,972$ million

Tax Books and Reporting Books It is no secret that many firms in the United States maintain two sets of books—one for tax purposes and one for reporting purposes—and that this practice not only is legal but is also widely accepted. While the details vary from company to company, the income reported to stockholders generally is much higher than the income reported for tax purposes. When valuing firms, we generally have access to only the former and not the latter, and this can affect our estimates in a number of ways:

- Dividing the taxes payable, which is computed on the taxable income, by the reported income, which is generally much higher, will yield a tax rate that is lower than the true tax rate. If we use this tax rate as the forecasted tax rate, we could over value the company. This is another reason for shifting to marginal tax rates in future periods.
If we base the projections on the reported income, we will overstate expected future income. The effect on cash flows is likely to be muted. To see why, consider one very common difference between reporting and tax income: Straight-line depreciation is used to compute the former and accelerated depreciation is used for the latter. Since we add depreciation back to after-tax income to get to cash flows, the drop in depreciation will offset the increase in earnings. The problem, however, is that we understate the tax benefits from depreciation.
Some companies capitalize expenses for reporting purposes (and for depreciating them in subsequent periods) but expense them for tax purposes. Here again, using the income and the capital expenditures from reporting books will result in an understatement of the tax benefits from the expensing.

Thus the problems created by firms having different standards for tax and accounting purposes are much greater if we focus on reported earnings (as is the case when we use earnings multiples like PE or EBITDA multiples) than when we use cash flows. If we did have a choice, however, we would base our valuations on the tax books rather than the reporting books.

# DEALING WITH TAX SUBSIDIES

Firms sometimes obtain tax subsidies from the government for investing in specified areas or types of businesses. These tax subsidies can take the form of either reduced tax rates or tax credits. Either way, these subsidies should increase the value of the firm. The question, of course, is how best to build in the effects into the cash flows. Perhaps the simplest approach is to first value the firm, ignoring the tax subsidies, and to then add on the value increment from the subsidies.

For instance, assume that you are valuing a pharmaceutical firm with operations in Puerto Rico, which entitle the firm to a tax break in the form of a lower tax rate on the income generated from these operations. You could value the firm using its normal marginal tax rate, and then add to that value the present value of the tax savings that will be generated by the Puerto Rican operations. There are three advantages with this approach:

1. It allows you to isolate the tax subsidy and consider it only for the period over which you are entitled to it. When the effects of these tax breaks are consolidated with other cash flows, there is a danger that they can be viewed as perpetuities.
2. The discount rate used to compute the tax breaks can be different from the discount rate used on the other cash flows of the firm. Thus, if the tax break is a guaranteed tax credit by the government, you could use a much lower discount rate to compute the present value of the cash flows.
3. Building on the theme that there are few free lunches, it can be argued that governments provide tax breaks for investments only because firms are exposed to higher costs or more risk in these investments. By isolating the value of the tax breaks, firms can then consider whether the trade-off operates in their favor. For example, assume that you are a sugar manufacturer that is offered a tax credit by the government for being in the business. In return, the government imposes sugar price controls. The firm can compare the value created by the tax credit with the value lost because of the price controls and decide whether it should fight to preserve its tax credit.

# REINVESTMENT NEEDS

The cash flow to the firm is computed after reinvestments. Two components go into estimating reinvestment. The first is net capital expenditures, which is the difference between capital expenditures and depreciation. The other is investments in non-cash working capital.

# Net Capital Expenditures

In estimating net capital expenditures, we generally deduct depreciation from capital expenditures. The rationale is that the positive cash flows from depreciation pay for at least a portion of capital expenditures, and that it is only the excess that represents a drain on the firm's cash flows. Whereas information on capital spending and depreciation are usually easily accessible in most financial statements, forecasting these expenditures can be difficult for three reasons. The first is that firms often incur capital spending in chunks—a large investment in one year can be followed by small investments in subsequent years. The second is that the accounting definition of capital spending does not incorporate those capital expenses that are treated as operating expenses such as R&D expenses. The third is that acquisitions are not classified by accountants as capital expenditures. For firms that grow primarily through acquisition, this will result in an understatement of the net capital expenditures.

Lumpy Capital Expenditures and the Need for Smoothing Firms seldom have smooth capital expenditure streams. Firms can go through periods when capital expenditures are very high (as is the case when a new product is introduced or a new plant built), followed by periods of relatively light capital expenditures. Consequently, when estimating the capital expenditures to use for forecasting future cash flows, you should normalize capital expenditures. There are at least two ways in which you can accomplish this objective.

The simplest normalization technique is to average capital expenditures over a number of years. For instance, you could estimate the average capital expenditures over the past four or five years for a manufacturing firm and use that number rather than the capital expenditures from the most recent year. By doing so, you could capture the fact that the firm may invest in a new plant every four years. If instead you had used the capital expenditures from the most recent year, you would have either overestimated capital expenditures (if the firm built a new plant that year) or underestimated them (if the plant had been built in an earlier year).

There are two measurement issues that you will need to confront. One relates to the number of years of history that you should use. The answer will vary across firms and will depend on how infrequently the firm makes large investments. The other is on the question of whether averaging capital expenditures over time requires us to average depreciation as well. Since depreciation is already spread out over time, the need for normalization should be much smaller. In addition, the tax benefits received by the firm reflect the actual depreciation in the most recent year, rather than an average depreciation over time. Unless depreciation is as volatile as capital expenditures, it makes more sense to leave depreciation untouched.

For firms with a limited history or firms that have changed their business mix over time, averaging over time either is not an option or will yield numbers that are not indicative of its true capital expenditure needs. For these firms, industry averages for capital expenditures are an alternative. Since the sizes of firms can vary across an industry, the averages are usually computed with capital expenditures as a percent of a base input—revenues and total assets are common choices. We prefer to look at capital expenditures as a percent of depreciation, and to average this statistic for the industry. In fact, if there are enough firms in the sample, you could look at the average for a subset of firms that are at the same stage of the life cycle as the firm being analyzed.

ILLUSTRATION 10.4: Estimating Normalized Net Capital Expenditures: Reliance Industries

<table><tr><td colspan="4">Reliance Industries is one of India&#x27;s largest firms and is involved in a multitude of businesses ranging from chemicals to textiles. The firm makes substantial investments in these businesses, and the following table summarizes the capital expenditures and depreciation for the period 1997 to 2000:</td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Capital Expenditures</td><td>Depreciation</td><td>Net Capital Expenditures</td></tr><tr><td>1997</td><td>INR 24,077</td><td>INR 4,101</td><td>INR 19,976</td></tr><tr><td>1998</td><td>INR 23,247</td><td>INR 6,673</td><td>INR 16,574</td></tr><tr><td>1999</td><td>INR 18,223</td><td>INR 8,550</td><td>INR 9,673</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>INR 21,118</td><td>INR12,784</td><td>INR 8,334</td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>INR 21,666</td><td>INR 8,027</td><td>INR 13,639</td></tr></table>

The firm's capital expenditures have been volatile, but its depreciation has been trending upward. There are two ways in which we can normalize the net capital expenditures. One is to take the average net capital expenditure over the four-year period, which would result in net capital expenditures of INR 13,639 million. The problem with doing this, however, is that the depreciation implicitly being used in the calculation is INR 8,027 million, which is well below the actual depreciation of INR 12,784. A better way to normalize capital expenditures is to use the average capital expenditure over the four-year period (INR 21,166) and depreciation from the year 2000 (INR 12,784) to arrive at a normalized net capital expenditure value:

Normalized net capital expenditures  $= 21,666 - 12,784 = \text{INR} 8,382$  million

Note that the normalization did not make much difference in this case because the actual net capital expenditures in 2000 amounted to INR 8,334 million.

Capital Expenses Treated as Operating Expenses In Chapter 9, we discussed the capitalization of expenses such as R&D and personnel training, where the benefits last over multiple periods, and examined the effects on earnings. There should also clearly be an impact on our estimates of capital expenditures, depreciation, and, consequently, net capital expenditures.

If we decide to recategorize some operating expenses as capital expenses, we should treat the current period's value for this item as a capital expenditure. For instance, if we decide to capitalize R&D expenses, the amount spent on R&D in the current period has to be added to capital expenditures.

Adjusted capital expenditures = Capital expenditures

+R&D expenses in current period

Since capitalizing an operating expense creates an asset, the amortization of this asset should be added to depreciation for the current period. Thus, capitalizing R&D creates a research asset, which generates an amortization in the current period.

Adjusted depreciation and amortization  $=$  Depreciation and amortization

+Amortization of the research asset

If we are adding the current period's expense to the capital expenditures and the amortization of the asset to the depreciation, the net capital expenditures of the firm will increase by the difference between the two:

Adjusted net capital expenditure  $=$  Net capital expenditures

+R&D expenses in current period
- Amortization of the research asset

Note that the adjustment that we make to net capital expenditure mirrors the adjustment we make to operating income. Since net capital expenditures are subtracted from after-tax operating income, we are, in a sense, nullifying the impact on cash flows of capitalizing R&D.

# ILLUSTRATION 10.5: Effect of Capitalizing R&D: Amgen in March 2009

In Illustration 9.2 we capitalized Amgen's R&D expense and created a research asset. In Illustration 10.3 we considered the additional tax benefit generated by the fact that a company can expense the entire amount. In this illustration, we complete the analysis by looking at the impact of capitalization on net capital expenditures.

Reviewing the numbers again, Amgen had an R&D expense of  $3,030 million in 2010. Capitalizing the R&D expenses, using an amortizable life of 10 years, yields a value for the research asset of$ 13,283 million and an amortization for the current year (2008) of $1,694 million. In addition, note that Amgen reported capital expenditures of $1,646 million in 2008 and depreciation and amortization amounting to 1,073 million. The adjustments to capital expenditures, depreciation, and amortization and net capital expenditures are:

Adjusted capital expenditures = Capital expenditures + R&D expenses in current period

= $1,646 million + $3,030 million = 4,696 million

Adjusted depreciation and amortization  $=$  Depreciation and amortization

+Amortization of the research asset

= $1,073 million + $1,694 million = 2,767 million

Adjusted net capital expenditure  $=$  Net capital expenditures + R&D expenses in current period

- Amortization of the research asset

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \$ 4,696 - \$ 2,767 \\ = \$ 1,929 \text {m i l l o n} \\ \end{array}
$$

Viewed in conjunction with the adjustment to after-tax operating income in Illustration 10.2, the change in net capital expenditure (an increase of  $1336 million from$ 573 million to 1,929 million) is exactly equal to the change in after-tax operating income. Capitalizing R&D thus has no effect on the free cash flow to the firm. Though the bottom-line cash flow does not change, the capitalization of R&D significantly changes the estimates of earnings and reinvestment. Thus it helps us better understand how profitable a firm is and how much it is reinvesting for future growth.

Acquisitions In estimating capital expenditures, we should not distinguish between internal investments (which are usually categorized as capital expenditures in cash flow statements) and external investments (which are acquisitions). The capital expenditures of a firm, therefore, need to include acquisitions. Since firms seldom make acquisitions every year, and each acquisition has a different price tag, the point about normalizing capital expenditures applies even more strongly to this item. The capital expenditure projections for a firm that makes an acquisition of  $100 million approximately every five years should therefore include about$ 20 million, adjusted for inflation, every year.

Should you distinguish between acquisitions funded with cash versus those funded with stock? We do not believe so. While there may be no cash spent by a firm in the latter case, the firm is increasing the number of shares outstanding. In fact, one way to think about stock-funded acquisitions is that the firm has skipped a step in the funding process. It could have issued the stock to the public, and used the cash to make the acquisitions. Another way of thinking about this issue is that a firm that uses stock to fund acquisitions year after year and is expected to continue to do so in the future will increase the number of shares outstanding. This, in turn, will dilute the value per share to existing stockholders.

# ILLUSTRATION 10.6: Estimating Net Capital Expenditures: Cisco Systems in 1999

Cisco Systems increased its market value a hundredfold during the 1990s, largely based on its capacity to grow revenues and earnings at an annual rate of  $60\%$  to  $70\%$ . Much of this growth was created by acquisitions of small companies with promising technologies and Cisco's ability to convert to them into commercial successes. To estimate net capital expenditures for Cisco in 1999, we begin with the estimates of capital expenditure ( $584 million) and depreciation ($ 486 million) in the 10-K. Based on these numbers, we would have concluded that Cisco's net capital expenditures in 1999 were 98 million.

The first adjustment we make to this number is to incorporate the effect of research and development expenses. We use a five-year amortizable life and estimate the value of the research asset and the amortization in 1999 in the following table:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Year</td><td rowspan="2">R&amp;D Expense</td><td rowspan="2" colspan="2">Unamortized at Year-End</td><td rowspan="2">Amortization This Year</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Current</td><td>$1,594.00</td><td>100.00\%</td><td>$1,594.00</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-1</td><td>$1,026.00</td><td>80.00\%</td><td>$820.80</td><td>$205.20</td></tr><tr><td>-2</td><td>$698.00</td><td>60.00\%</td><td>$418.80</td><td>$139.60</td></tr><tr><td>-3</td><td>$399.00</td><td>40.00\%</td><td>$159.60</td><td>$79.80</td></tr><tr><td>-4</td><td>$211.00</td><td>20.00\%</td><td>$42.20</td><td>$42.20</td></tr><tr><td>-5</td><td>$89.00</td><td>0.00\%</td><td>$—</td><td>$17.80</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Value of the research asset</td><td>$3,035.40</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Amortization this year</td><td>484.60</td></tr></table>

The net capital expenditures for Cisco were adjusted by adding back the R&D expenses in the most recent financial year ( $1,594 million) and subtracting the amortization of the research asset ($ 485 million).

The second adjustment is to bring in the effect of acquisitions that Cisco made during the last financial year. The following table summarizes the acquisitions made during the year and the prices paid on these acquisitions:

<table><tr><td>Acquired</td><td>Method of Acquisition</td><td>Price Paid</td></tr><tr><td>GeoTel</td><td>Pooling</td><td>$1,344</td></tr><tr><td>Fibex</td><td>Pooling</td><td>318</td></tr><tr><td>Sentient</td><td>Pooling</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>American Internet Corporation</td><td>Purchase</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>Summa Four</td><td>Purchase</td><td>129</td></tr><tr><td>Clarity Wireless</td><td>Purchase</td><td>153</td></tr><tr><td>Selsius Systems</td><td>Purchase</td><td>134</td></tr><tr><td>PipeLinks</td><td>Purchase</td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td>Amteva Technologies</td><td>Purchase</td><td>159</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>$2,516</td></tr><tr><td>Dollars in millions.</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table> its acquisitions in 1999 are not unusual and reflect Cisco's reinvestment policy. The amortization associated with these acquisitions is already included as part of depreciation by the firm. The following table summarizes the final net capital expenditures for Cisco in 1999.

Note that both purchase and pooling transactions are included, and that the sum total of these acquisitions is added to net capital expenditures in 1999. We are assuming, given Cisco's track record, that

<table><tr><td>Capital expenditures</td><td>$ 584.00</td></tr><tr><td>– Depreciation</td><td>$ 486.00</td></tr><tr><td>Net cap ex (from financials)</td><td>$ 98.00</td></tr><tr><td>+ R&amp;D expenditures</td><td>$1,594.00</td></tr><tr><td>– Amortization of R&amp;D</td><td>$ 484.60</td></tr><tr><td>+ Acquisitions</td><td>$2,516.00</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted net cap ex</td><td>3,723.40</td></tr></table>

# IGNORING ACQUISITIONS IN VALUATION: A POSSIBILITY?

Incorporating acquisitions into net capital expenditures and value can be difficult, and especially so for firms that do large acquisitions infrequently. Predicting whether there will be acquisitions, how much they will cost, and what they will deliver in terms of higher growth can be close to impossible. There is one way in which you can ignore acquisitions, but it does come with a cost. If you assume that firms pay a fair price on acquisitions (i.e., a price that reflects the fair value of the target company) and you assume that the target company stockholders claim any or all synergy or control value, acquisitions have no effect on value no matter how large they might be and how much they might seem to deliver in terms of higher growth. The reason is simple: A fair-value acquisition is an investment that earns its required return—a zero net present value investment.

If you choose not to consider acquisitions when valuing a firm, you have to remain internally consistent. The portion of growth that is due to acquisitions should not be considered in the valuation. A common mistake that is made in valuing companies that have posted impressive historic growth numbers from an acquisition-based strategy is to extrapolate from this growth and ignore acquisitions at the same time. This will result in an overvaluation of your firm, since you have counted the benefits of the acquisitions but have not paid for them.

What is the cost of ignoring acquisitions? Not all acquisitions are fairly priced, and not all synergy and control value ends up with the target company stockholders. Ignoring the costs and benefits of acquisitions will result in an misvaluation of a firm that has established a reputation for growing through acquisitions. We undervalue firms that create value by making good acquisitions and overvalue firms that destroy value by overpaying on acquisitions.

# Investment in Working Capital

The second component of reinvestment is the cash that needs to be set aside for working capital needs. Increases in working capital tie up more cash and hence generate negative cash flows. Conversely, decreases in working capital release cash and positive cash flows.

Defining Working Capital Working capital is usually defined to be the difference between current assets and current liabilities. However, we will modify that definition when we measure working capital for valuation purposes.

We will back out cash and investments in marketable securities from current assets. This is because cash, especially in large amounts, is invested by firms in Treasury bills, short-term government securities, or commercial paper. Although the return on these investments may be lower than what the firm may make on its real investments, they represent a fair return for riskless investments. Unlike inventory, accounts receivable, and other current assets, cash then earns a fair return and should not be included in measures of working capital. Are there exceptions to this rule? When valuing a firm that has to maintain a large cash balance for day-to-day operations or a firm that operates in a market in a poorly developed banking system, you could consider the cash needed for operations as a part of working capital but only if that cash is wasting cash, i.e., cash that is not earning a fair market return. As we shift from a cash-based economy, this operating cash requirement has become smaller and smaller.

We will also back out all interest-bearing debt—short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that is due in the current period—from the current liabilities. This debt will be considered when computing cost of capital and it would be inappropriate to count it twice.

The noncash working capital varies widely across firms in different sectors and often across firms in the same sector. Figure 10.2 shows the distribution of noncash working capital as a percent of revenues for U.S. firms in January 2011.

# ILLUSTRATION 10.7: Working Capital versus Noncash Working Capital: Marks and Spencer

Marks and Spencer operates retail stores in the United Kingdom and has substantial holdings in retail firms in other parts of the world. The following table breaks down the components of working capital for the firm for 1999 and 2000 and reports both the total working capital and noncash working capital in each year:

<table><tr><td></td><td>1999</td><td>2000</td></tr><tr><td>Cash and near cash</td><td>$ 282</td><td>$ 301</td></tr><tr><td>Marketable securities</td><td>$ 204</td><td>$ 386</td></tr><tr><td>Trade debtors (accounts receivable)</td><td>$1,980</td><td>$2,186</td></tr><tr><td>Stocks (inventory)</td><td>$ 515</td><td>$ 475</td></tr><tr><td>Other current assets</td><td>$ 271</td><td>$ 281</td></tr><tr><td>Total current assets</td><td>$3,252</td><td>$3,629</td></tr><tr><td>Noncash current assets</td><td>$2,766</td><td>$2,942</td></tr><tr><td>Trade creditors (accounts payable)</td><td>$ 215</td><td>$ 219</td></tr><tr><td>Short-term debt</td><td>$ 913</td><td>$1,169</td></tr><tr><td>Other short-term liabilities</td><td>$ 903</td><td>$ 774</td></tr><tr><td>Total current liabilities</td><td>$2,031</td><td>$2,162</td></tr><tr><td>Nondebt current liabilities</td><td>$1,118</td><td>$ 993</td></tr><tr><td>Working capital</td><td>$1,221</td><td>$1,467</td></tr><tr><td>Noncash working capital</td><td>$1,648</td><td>$1,949</td></tr></table>

The noncash working capital is substantially higher than the working capital in both years. We would suggest that the former is a much better measure of cash tied up in working capital.

Estimating Expected Changes in Noncash Working Capital While we can estimate the noncash working capital change fairly simply for any year using financial statements, this estimate has to be used with caution. Changes in noncash working capital are unstable, with big increases in some years followed by big decreases in subsequent years. To ensure that the projections are not the result of an unusual base year, you should tie the changes in working capital to expected changes in revenues or costs of goods sold at the firm over time. The noncash working capital as a percent of revenues can be used, in conjunction with expected revenue changes each period, to estimate projected changes in noncash working capital over time. You can obtain the noncash working capital as a percent of revenues by looking at the firm's history or at industry standards.

Should you break working capital down into more detail? In other words, is there a payoff to estimating individual items, such as accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable separately? The answer will depend on both the firm being analyzed and how far into the future working capital is being projected. For firms where inventory and accounts receivable behave in very different ways as revenues grow, it clearly makes sense to break working capital down into detail. The cost, of course, is that it increases the number of inputs needed to value a firm. In addition, the payoff to breaking working capital down into individual items will become smaller as we go further into the future. For most firms, estimating a composite number for noncash working capital is easier to do and often more accurate than breaking it down into more detail.

# ILLUSTRATION 10.8: Estimating Noncash Working Capital Needs: The Gap

As a specialty retailer, the Gap has substantial inventory and working capital needs. At the end of the 2000 financial year (which concluded in January 2001), the Gap reported  $1,904 million in inventory and$ 335 million in other noncash current assets. At the same time, the accounts payable amounted to $1,067 million and other non-interest-bearing current liabilities were $702 million. The noncash working capital for the Gap in January 2001 can be estimated as follows:

Noncash working capital = \ 1,904 + \ 335 - \ 1,067 - \$ 702 = \$ 470 million

The following table reports on the noncash working capital at the end of the previous year and the total revenues in each year:

<table><tr><td></td><td>1999</td><td>2000</td><td>Change</td></tr><tr><td>Inventory</td><td>$1,462</td><td>$1,904</td><td>$442</td></tr><tr><td>Other noncash current assets</td><td>$285</td><td>$335</td><td>$50</td></tr><tr><td>Accounts payable</td><td>$806</td><td>$1,067</td><td>$261</td></tr><tr><td>Other noninterest-bearing current liabilities</td><td>$778</td><td>$702</td><td>-$76</td></tr><tr><td>Noncash working capital</td><td>$163</td><td>$470</td><td>$307</td></tr><tr><td>Revenues</td><td>$11,635</td><td>$13,673</td><td>$2,038</td></tr><tr><td>Working capital as \% of revenues</td><td>1.40\%</td><td>3.44\%</td><td>15.06\%</td></tr></table>

The noncash working capital increased by 307 million from the preceding year to this one. When forecasting the noncash working capital needs for the Gap, there are five choices:

1. One is to use the change in noncash working capital from the year (307 million) and to grow that change at the same rate as earnings are expected to grow in the future. This is probably the least desirable option because changes in noncash working capital from year to year are extremely volatile, and last year's change may in fact be an outlier.
2. The second is to base our changes on noncash working capital as a percent of revenues in the most recent year and expected revenue growth in future years. In the case of the Gap, that would indicate that noncash working capital changes in future years will be  $3.44\%$  of revenue changes in that year. This is a much better option than the first one, but the noncash working capital as a percent of revenues can also change from one year to the next.
3. The third is to base our changes on the marginal noncash working capital as a percent of revenues in the most recent year, computed by dividing the change in noncash working capital in the most recent year and the change in revenues in the most recent year, by expected revenue growth in future years. In the case of the Gap, this would lead to noncash working capital changes being  $15.06\%$  of revenues in future periods. This approach is best used for firms whose business is changing and where growth is occurring in areas different from the past. For instance, a brick-and-mortar retailer that is growing mostly online may have a very different marginal working capital requirement than the total.
4. The fourth is to base our changes on the noncash working capital as a percent of revenues over a historical period. For instance, noncash working capital as a percent of revenues between 1997 and 2000 averaged out to  $4.5\%$  of revenues. The advantage of this approach is that it smooths out year-to-year shifts, but it may not be appropriate if there is a trend (upward or downward) in working capital.
5. The final approach is to ignore the working capital history of the firm and to base the projections on the industry average for noncash working capital as a percent of revenues. This approach is most appropriate when a firm's history reveals a working capital that is volatile and unpredictable. It is also the best way of estimating noncash working capital for very small firms that may see economies of scale as they grow. While these conditions do not apply for the Gap, we can still estimate noncash working capital requirements using the average noncash working capital as a percent of revenues for specialty retailers which is  $7.54\%$ .

To illustrate how much of a change each of these assumptions can have on working capital requirements, the following table forecasts expected changes in noncash working capital (WC) using each of them. In making these estimates, we have assumed a  $10\%$  growth rate in revenues and earnings for the Gap for the next five years.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Current</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Revenues</td><td>$13,673.00</td><td>$15,040.30</td><td>$16,544.33</td><td>$18,198.76</td><td>$20,018.64</td><td>$22,020.50</td></tr><tr><td>Change in revenues</td><td></td><td>$1,367.30</td><td>$1,504.03</td><td>$1,654.43</td><td>$1,819.88</td><td>$2,001.86</td></tr><tr><td>1.

Industry average</td><td>7.54\%</td><td>$103.09</td><td>$113.40</td><td>$124.74</td><td>$137.22</td><td>150.94</td></tr></table>

The noncash working capital investment varies widely across the five approaches that have been described here.

Negative Working Capital (or Changes) Can the change in noncash working capital be negative? The answer is clearly yes. Consider, though, the implications of such a change. When noncash working capital decreases, it releases tied-up cash and increases the cash flow of the firm. If a firm has bloated inventory or gives out credit too easily, managing one or both components more efficiently can reduce working capital and be a source of positive cash flows into the immediate future—three, four, or even five years. The question, however, becomes whether it can be a source of cash flows for longer than that. At some point in time, there will be no more inefficiencies left in the system, and any further decreases in working capital can have negative consequences for revenue growth and profits. Therefore, it appears that for firms with positive working capital, decreases in working capital are feasible only for short periods. In fact, once working capital is being managed efficiently, the working capital changes from year to year should be estimated using working capital as a percent of revenues. For example, consider a firm that has noncash working capital that represents 10 percent of revenues and that you believe that better management of working capital could reduce this to 6 percent of revenues. You could allow working capital to decline each year for the next four years from 10 percent to 6 percent, and, once this adjustment is made, begin estimating the working capital requirement each year as 6 percent of additional revenues. The following table provides estimates of the change in noncash working capital on this firm, assuming that current revenues are 1 billion and that revenues are expected to grow 10 percent a year for the next 15 years.

<table><tr><td>Year</td><td>Current</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Revenues</td><td>$1,000.00</td><td>$1,100.00</td><td>$1,210.00</td><td>$1,331.00</td><td>$1,464.10</td><td>$1,610.51</td></tr><tr><td>Noncash WC as \% of revenues</td><td>10\%</td><td>9\%</td><td>8\%</td><td>7\%</td><td>6\%</td><td>6\%</td></tr><tr><td>Noncash working capital</td><td>$ 100.00</td><td>$ 99.00</td><td>$ 96.80</td><td>$ 93.17</td><td>$ 87.85</td><td>$ 96.63</td></tr><tr><td>Change in noncash WC</td><td></td><td>-$ 1.00</td><td>-$ 2.20</td><td>-$ 0.63</td><td>-$ 5.32</td><td>8.78</td></tr></table>

Can working capital itself be negative? Again, the answer is yes. Firms whose non-debt current liabilities exceed noncash current assets have negative noncash working capital. This is a thornier issue than negative changes in working capital. A firm that has a negative working capital is, in a sense, using supplier credit as a source of capital, especially if the negative working capital becomes larger as the firm becomes larger. A number of firms, with Amazon being the most prominent example, have used this strategy to grow. While this may seem like a cost-efficient strategy, there are potential downsides. The first is that supplier credit is generally not really free. To the extent that delaying paying supplier bills may lead to the loss of cash discounts and other price breaks, firms are paying for the privilege. Thus a firm that decides to adopt this strategy will have to compare the costs of this capital to more traditional forms of borrowing.

The second downside is that a negative noncash working capital has generally been viewed by both accountants and ratings agencies as a source of default risk. To the extent that a firm's rating drops and interest rates paid by the firm increase, there may be costs created for other capital by using supplier credit as a source. As a practical question, you still have an estimation problem on your hands when forecasting working capital requirements for a firm that has negative noncash working capital. As in the previous scenario, with negative changes in noncash working capital, there is no reason why firms cannot continue to use supplier credit as a source of capital in the short term. In the long term, however, we should not assume that noncash working capital will become more and more negative over time. At some point in the future we have to assume either that the change in noncash working capital is zero or that pressure will build for increases in working capital.

# CONCLUSION

When valuing a firm, the cash flows that are discounted should be after taxes and reinvestment needs but before debt payments. This chapter considered some of the challenges in coming up with this number for firms.

The chapter began with the corrected and updated version of income described in Chapter 9. To state this income in after-tax terms, you need a tax rate. Firms generally state their effective tax rates in their financial statements, but these effective tax rates can be different from marginal tax rates. Although the effective tax rate can be used to arrive at the after-tax operating income in the early years, the tax rate used should converge on the marginal tax rate in future periods. For firms that are losing money and not paying taxes, the net operating losses that they are accumulating will protect some of their future income from taxation.

The reinvestment that firms make in their own operations is then considered in two parts. The first part is the net capital expenditure of the firm, which is the difference between capital expenditures (a cash outflow) and depreciation (effectively a cash inflow). In this net capital expenditure, we include the capitalized operating expenses (such as R&D) and acquisitions. The second part relates to investments in noncash working capital, mainly inventory and accounts receivable. Increases in noncash working capital represent cash outflows to the firm, while decreases represent cash inflows. Noncash working capital at most firms tends to be volatile and may need to be smoothed out when forecasting future cash flows.

# QUESTIONS AND SHORT PROBLEMS

In the problems following, use an equity risk premium of 5.5 percent if none is specified.

1. You are valuing GenFlex, a small manufacturing firm, which reported paying taxes of $12.5 million on taxable income of $50 million and reinvesting 15 million in the most recent year. The firm has no debt outstanding, the cost of capital is 11\%, and the marginal tax rate for the firm is 35\%. Assuming that the firm's earnings and reinvestment are expected to grow 10\% a year for three years and 5\% a year forever after that, estimate the value of this firm: a. Using the effective tax rate to estimate after-tax operating income.

b. Using the marginal tax rate to estimate after-tax operating income.

c. Using the effective tax rate for the next three years and the marginal tax rate in year 4.

2. You are trying to estimate the free cash flow to the firm for RevTech, a technology firm. The firm reported $80 million in earnings before interest and taxes, capital expenditures of $30 million, and depreciation of 20 million in the most recent year. There are two additional complications:

The firm had R&D expenses of $50 million in the most recent year. You believe that a three-year amortizable life is appropriate for this firm and the R&D expenses for the past three years have amounted to $20 million, $30 million, and $40 million respectively.

 The firm also made two acquisitions during the year—a cash-based acquisition for $45 million and a stock-based acquisition for $35 million.

If the firm has no working capital requirements and a tax rate of  $40\%$ , estimate the free cash flow to the firm in the most recent year.

3. Lewis Clark, a firm in the travel business, reported earnings before interest and taxes of 60 million last year, but you have uncovered the following additional items of interest:
- The firm had operating lease expenses of 50 million last year and has a commitment to make equivalent payments for the next eight years.
- The firm reported capital expenditures of  $30 million and depreciation of$ 50 million last year. However, the firm also made two acquisitions, one funded with cash for $50 million and another funded with a stock swap for $30 million. The amortization of these acquisitions is already included in the current year's depreciation.
The total working capital increased from $180 million at the start of the year to $200 million at the end of the year. However, the firm's cash balance was a significant portion of this working capital and increased from $80 million at the start of the year to $120 million at the end. (The cash is invested in T-bills.)
The tax rate is  $40\%$ , and the firm's pretax cost of debt is  $6\%$ .

Estimate the free cash flows to the firm last year.

4. The following is the balance sheet for Ford Motor Company as of December 31, 1994 (in millions).

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>$ 19,927</td><td>Accounts payable</td><td>$ 11,635</td></tr><tr><td>Receivables</td><td>$132,904</td><td>Debt due within 1 year</td><td>$ 36,240</td></tr><tr><td>Inventory</td><td>$ 10,128</td><td>Other current liabilities</td><td>$ 2,721</td></tr><tr><td>Current assets</td><td>$ 91,524</td><td>Current liabilities</td><td>$ 50,596</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed assets</td><td>$ 45,586</td><td>Short-term debt</td><td>$ 36,200</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Long-term debt</td><td>$ 37,490</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Equity</td><td>$ 12,824</td></tr><tr><td>Total assets</td><td>$137,110</td><td>Total liabilities</td><td>$137,110</td></tr></table>

The firm had revenues of  $154,951 million in 1994 and cost of goods sold of$ 103,817 million.

a. Estimate the net working capital.

b. Estimate the noncash working capital.

c. Estimate noncash working capital as a percent of revenues.

5. Continuing problem 4, assume that you expect Ford's revenues to grow  $10\%$  a year for the next five years.

a. Estimate the expected changes in noncash working capital each year, assuming that noncash working capital as a percent of revenues remains at 1994 levels.

b. Estimate the expected changes in noncash working capital each year, assuming that noncash working capital as a percent of revenues will converge on the industry average of  $4.3\%$  of revenues.

6. Newell Stores is a retail firm that reported $1 billion in revenues, $80 million in after-tax operating income, and noncash working capital of -50 million last year.

a. Assuming that working capital as a percent of revenues remains unchanged next year and that there are no net capital expenditures, estimate the free cash flow to the firm if revenues are expected to grow  $10\%$ .

b. If you are projecting free cash flows to the firm for the next 10 years, would you make the same assumptions about working capital? Why or why not?
