# Earnings Multiples

One of the more intuitive ways to think of the value of any asset is as a multiple of the earnings that asset generates. When buying a stock, it is common to look at the price paid as a multiple of the earnings per share generated by the company. The earnings per share themselves can be estimated before or after extraordinary items and can reflect what the company earned in prior periods or a future period.

When buying a business, as opposed to just the equity in the business, it is common to examine the value of the operating assets of the firm (also called enterprise value) as a multiple of the operating income or the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). While, for a buyer of the equity or the operating assets, a lower multiple is better than a higher one, these multiples will be affected by the growth potential and risk of the business being acquired.

# Book Value or Replacement Value Multiples

While markets provide one estimate of the value of a business, accountants often provide a very different estimate of the same business. The accounting estimate of book value is determined by accounting rules and is heavily influenced by the original price paid for assets and any accounting adjustments (such as depreciation) made since. Investors often look at the relationship between the price they pay for a stock and the book value of equity (or net worth) as a measure of how overor undervalued a stock is; the price-book value (PBV) ratio that emerges can vary widely across industries, depending again on the growth potential and the quality of the investments in each. When valuing businesses, you estimate this ratio using the enterprise value relative to the book value of all invested capital (rather than just the equity). For those who believe that book value is not a good measure of the true value of the assets, an alternative is to use the replacement cost of the assets; the ratio of the value of the firm to replacement cost is called Tobin's Q, discussed in Chapter 19.

# Revenue Multiples

Both earnings and book value are accounting measures and are determined by accounting rules and principles. An alternative measure, which is far less affected by accounting choices, is revenue, and you can scale either equity or enterprise value to it. For equity investors, this ratio is the price-sales (PS) ratio, where the market value of equity is divided by the revenues. For enterprise value, this ratio can be modified as the value-sales (VS) ratio, where the numerator becomes the enterprise value of the firm. This ratio, again, varies widely across sectors, largely as a function of the profit margins in each. The advantage of using revenue multiples, however, is that it becomes far easier to compare firms in different markets, with different accounting systems at work, than it is to compare earnings or book value multiples. It is also useful in sectors composed of young companies, where most or all are losing money.

# Sector-Specific Multiples

While earnings, book value, and revenue multiples are multiples that can be computed for firms in any sector and across the entire market, there are some multiples that are specific to a sector. For instance, when dot-com firms first appeared on the market in the later 1990s, they had negative earnings and negligible revenues and book value. Analysts looking for a multiple to value these firms divided the market value of each of these firms by the number of hits generated by that firm's web site. Firms with a low market value per customer hit were viewed as more undervalued. More recently, social media companies such as LinkedIn and Facebook have been judged by the market value of equity per member.

While there are conditions under which sector-specific multiples can be justified, and a few are discussed in Chapter 20, they are dangerous for two reasons. First, since they cannot be computed for other sectors or for the entire market, sector-specific multiples can result in persistent overor undervaluations of sectors relative to the rest of the market. Thus, investors who would never consider paying 80 times revenues for a firm might not have the same qualms about paying 2,000 for every page hit (on the web site), largely because they have no sense of what high, low, or average is on this measure. Second, it is far more difficult to relate sector-specific multiples to fundamentals, which is an essential ingredient to using multiples well. For instance, does a visitor to a company's web site translate into higher revenues and profits? And how much value is created by an additional member on a social media site? The answer will not only vary from company to company, but will also be difficult to estimate looking forward.

# FOUR BASIC STEPS TO USING MULTIPLES

Multiples are easy to use and easy to misuse. There are four basic steps to using multiples wisely and for detecting misuse in the hands of others. The first step is to ensure that the multiple is defined consistently and that it is measured uniformly across the firms being compared. The second step is to be aware of the cross-sectional distribution of the multiple, not only across firms in the sector being analyzed but also across the entire market. The third step is to analyze the multiple and understand not only what fundamentals determine the multiple but also how changes in these fundamentals translate into changes in the multiple. The final step is finding the right firms to use for comparison, and controlling for differences that may persist across these firms.

# Definitional Tests

Even the simplest multiples can be defined differently by different analysts. Consider, for instance, the price-earnings (PE) ratio. Most analysts define it to be the market price divided by the earnings per share, but that is where the consensus ends. There are a number of variants on the PE ratio. While the current price is conventionally used in the numerator, there are some analysts who use the average price over the prior six months or year. The earnings per share in the denominator can be the earnings per share from the most recent financial year (yielding the current PE), the last four quarters of earnings (yielding the trailing PE), or expected earnings per share in the next financial year (resulting in a forward PE). In addition, earnings per share can be computed based on primary shares outstanding or fully diluted shares, and can include or exclude extraordinary items. Figure 17.1 provides the PE ratios for Apple in May 2011, using each of these measures.

Not only can these variants on earnings yield vastly different values for the price-earnings ratio, but the one that gets used by analysts depends on their biases. For instance, in periods of rising earnings, the forward PE yields consistently lower values than the trailing PE, which, in turn, is lower than the current PE. A bullish analyst will tend to use the forward PE to make the case that the stock is trading at a low multiple of earnings, while a bearish analyst will focus on the current PE to make the case that the multiple is too high. The first step when discussing a valuation based on a multiple is to ensure that everyone in the discussion is using the same definition for that multiple.

Consistency Every multiple has a numerator and a denominator. The numerator can be either an equity value (such as market price or value of equity) or a firm value (such as enterprise value, which is the sum of the values of debt and equity, net of cash). The denominator can be an equity measure (such as earnings per share, net income, or book value of equity) or a firm measure (such as operating income, EBITDA, or book value of capital).

FIGURE 17.1 PE Ratios—Apple in May 2011

One of the key tests to run on a multiple is to examine whether the numerator and denominator are defined consistently. If the numerator for a multiple is an equity value, then the denominator should be an equity value as well. If the numerator is a firm value, then the denominator should be a firm value as well. To illustrate, the price-earnings ratio is a consistently defined multiple, since the numerator is the price per share (which is an equity value) and the denominator is earnings per share (which is also an equity value). So is the enterprise value to EBITDA multiple, since the numerator and denominator are both firm value measures.

Are there any multiples in use that are inconsistently defined? Consider the Price-to-EBITDA multiple, a multiple that acquired a few adherents in the past few years. The numerator in this multiple is an equity value, and the denominator is a measure of earnings to the firm. The analysts who use this multiple will probably argue that the inconsistency does not matter since the multiple is computed the same way for all of the comparable firms; but they would be wrong. If some firms on the list have no debt and others carry significant amounts of debt, the latter will look cheap on a Price-to-EBITDA basis, when in fact they might be overpriced or correctly priced.

Uniformity In relative valuation, the multiple is computed for all of the firms in a group and then compared across these firms to make judgments on which firms are overpriced and which are underpriced. For this comparison to have any merit, the multiple has to be defined uniformly across all of the firms in the group. Thus, if the trailing PE is used for one firm, it has to be used for all of the others as well. In fact, one of the problems with using the current PE to compare firms in a group is that different firms can have different fiscal year-ends. This can lead to some firms having their prices divided by earnings from July to June, with other firms having their prices divided by earnings from January to December. While the differences can be minor in mature sectors, where earnings do not make quantum jumps over six months, they can be large in high-growth sectors.

With both earnings and book value measures, there is another component to be concerned about, and that is the accounting standards used to estimate earnings and book values. Differences in accounting standards can result in very different earnings and book value numbers for similar firms. This makes comparisons of multiples across firms in different markets, with different accounting standards, very difficult. Even with the same accounting standards, the fact that some firms use different accounting rules (on depreciation and expensing) for reporting purposes and tax purposes and others do not can throw off comparisons of earnings multiples.

# Descriptive Tests

When using a multiple, it is always useful to have a sense of what a high value, a low value, or a typical value for that multiple is in the market. In other words, knowing the distributional characteristics of a multiple is a key part of using that multiple to identify underor overvalued firms. In addition, you need to understand the effects of outliers on averages and unearth any biases in these values introduced in the process of estimating multiples.

Distributional Characteristics Many analysts who use multiples have a sector focus and have a sense of how different firms in their sector rank on specific multiples. What is often lacking, however, is a sense of how the multiple is distributed across the entire market. Why, you might ask, should a software analyst care about price-earnings ratios of utility stocks? Because both software and utility stocks are competing for the same investment dollar, they have to, in a sense, play by the same rules. Furthermore, an awareness of how multiples vary across sectors can be very useful in detecting when the sector you are analyzing is overor undervalued.

What are the distributional characteristics that matter? The standard statistics—the average and standard deviation—are where you should start, but they represent the beginning of the exploration. The fact that multiples such as the price-earnings ratio can never be less than zero and are unconstrained in terms of a maximum results in distributions for these multiples that are skewed toward the positive values. Consequently, the average values for these multiples will be higher than median values,[2] and the latter are much more representative of the typical firm in the group. While the maximum and minimum values are usually of limited use, the percentile values (10th percentile, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, 90th percentile, and so on) can be useful in judging what is a high or low value for the multiple in the group.

Outliers and Averages As noted earlier, multiples are unconstrained on the upper end, and firms can have price-earnings ratios of 500 or 2,000 or even 10,000. This can occur not only because of high stock prices but also because earnings at firms can sometimes drop to a fraction of a cent. These outliers will result in averages that are not representative of the sample. In most cases, services that compute and report average values for multiples either throw out these outliers when computing the averages or constrain the multiples to be less than or equal to a fixed number. For instance, any firm that has a price-earnings ratio greater than 500 may be given a price-earnings ratio of 500.

When using averages obtained from a service, it is important that you know how the service dealt with outliers in computing the averages. In fact, the sensitivity of the estimated average to outliers is another reason for looking at the median values for multiples.

Biases in Estimating Multiples With every multiple, there are firms for which the multiple cannot be computed. Consider again the price-earnings ratio. When the earnings per share are negative, the price-earnings ratio for a firm is not meaningful and is usually not reported. When looking at the average price-earnings ratio across a group of firms, the firms with negative earnings will all drop out of the sample because the price-earnings ratio cannot be computed. Why should this matter when the sample is large? The fact that the firms that are taken out of the sample are the firms losing money creates a bias in the selection process and skews the statistics.

There are three solutions to this problem. The first is to be aware of the bias and build it into the analysis. In practical terms, this will mean adjusting the average PE to reflect the elimination of the money-losing firms. The second is to aggregate the market value of equity and net income (or loss) for all of the firms in the group, including the money-losing ones, and compute the price-earnings ratio using the aggregated values. Figure 17.2 summarizes the average PE ratio, the median PE ratio, and the PE ratio based on aggregated earnings for three sectors: software, chemicals, and insurance companies. While the values are very different for software companies, they are closer for the other two sectors, mostly because the software sector has more companies with negative earnings and extreme (high) PE ratios. Note that the median PE ratio is lower than the average PE ratio in all three sectors. The third choice is to use a multiple that can be computed for all of the firms in the group. The inverse of the price-earning ratio, which is called the earnings yield, can be computed for all firms, including those losing money.

# Analytical Tests

In discussing why analysts were so fond of using multiples, it was argued that relative valuations require fewer assumptions than discounted cash flow valuations. While this is technically true, it is so only on the surface. In reality, you make just as many assumptions when you do a relative valuation as you make in a discounted cash flow valuation. The difference is that the assumptions in a relative valuation are implicit and unstated, whereas those in discounted cash flow valuation are explicit. The two primary questions that you need to answer before using a multiple are: What are the fundamentals that determine at what multiple a firm should trade? How do changes in the fundamentals affect the multiple?

FIGURE 17.2 PE Ratio in 2010: Average, Median, and Aggregate

Determinants In the chapters on discounted cash flow valuation, we observed that the value of a firm is a function of three variables—its capacity to generate cash flows, its expected growth in these cash flows, and the uncertainty associated with these cash flows. Every multiple, whether it is of earnings, revenues, or book value, is a function of the same three variables—risk, growth, and cash flow generating potential. Intuitively, then, firms with higher growth rates, less risk, and greater cash flow generating potential should trade at higher multiples than firms with lower growth, higher risk, and less cash flow potential.

The specific measures of growth, risk, and cash flow generating potential that are used will vary from multiple to multiple. To look under the hood, so to speak, of equity and firm value multiples, you can go back to fairly simple discounted cash flow models for equity and enterprise value (EV) and use them to derive the multiples.

In the simplest discounted cash flow model for equity, which is a stable growth dividend discount model, the value of equity is:

$$
\text {V a l u e o f e q u i t y} = \mathrm {P} _ {0} = \frac {\mathrm {D P S} _ {1}}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}
$$ where  $\mathrm{DPS}_1$  is the expected dividend in the next year,  $\mathbf{k}_{\mathrm{e}}$  is the cost of equity, and  $\mathbf{g}_{\mathrm{n}}$  is the expected stable growth rate. Dividing both sides by the earnings, you obtain the discounted cash flow equation specifying the PE ratio for a stable growth firm:


$$

\frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {E P S} _ {0}} = \mathrm {P E} = \frac {\text {P a y o u t r a t i o} \times (1 + \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}})}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$

Dividing both sides by the book value of equity, you can estimate the price-book value ratio for a stable growth firm:

$$

\frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {B V} _ {0}} = \mathrm {P B V} = \frac {\mathrm {R O E} \times \text {P a y o u t r a t i o} \times (1 + \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}})}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$ where ROE is the return on equity. Dividing by the sales per share, the price-sales ratio for a stable-growth firm can be estimated as a function of its profit margin, payout ratio, profit margin, and expected growth.


$$

\frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {B V} _ {0}} = \mathrm {P B V} = \frac {\mathrm {R O E} \times \text {P a y o u t r a t i o} \times (1 + \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}})}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$

You can do a similar analysis to derive the firm value multiples. The value of the operating assets of a firm in stable growth can be written as:

$$

\text {V a l u e o f o p e r a t i n g a s s e t s} = \mathrm {E V} _ {0} = \frac {\mathrm {F C F F} _ {1}}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {c}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$

Dividing both sides by the expected free cash flow to the firm yields the EV-to-FCFF multiple for a stable growth firm:

$$

\frac {\mathrm {E V} _ {0}}{\mathrm {F C F F} _ {1}} = \frac {1}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {c}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$

Since the free cash flow the firm is the after-tax operating income netted against the net capital expenditures and working capital needs of the firm, the multiples of EBIT, after-tax EBIT, and EBITDA can also be estimated similarly.

The point of this analysis is not to suggest that you go back to using discounted cash flow valuation, but to understand the variables that may cause these multiples to vary across firms in the same sector. If you ignore these variables, you might conclude that a stock with a PE of 8 is cheaper than one with a PE of 12, when the true reason may be that the latter has higher expected growth; or you might decide that a stock with a PBV ratio of 0.7 is cheaper than one with a PBV ratio of 1.5, when the true reason may be that the latter has a much higher return on equity.

Relationship Knowing the fundamentals that determine a multiple is a useful first step, but understanding how the multiple changes as the fundamentals change is just as critical to using the multiple. To illustrate, knowing that higher-growth firms have higher PE ratios is not a sufficient insight if you are called on to analyze whether a firm with a growth rate that is twice as high as the average growth rate for the sector should have a PE ratio that is 1.5 times or 1.8 times or 2 times the average price-earnings ratio for the sector. To make this judgment, you need to know how the PE ratio changes as the growth rate changes.

A surprisingly large number of analyses are based on the assumption that there is a linear relationship between multiples and fundamentals. For instance, the price-earnings/growth (PEG) ratio, which is the ratio of the PE to the expected growth rate of a firm and widely used to analyze high-growth firms, implicitly assumes that PE ratios and expected growth rates are linearly related.

One of the advantages of deriving the multiples from a discounted cash flow model, as was done in the last section, is that you can analyze the relationship between each fundamental variable and the multiple by keeping everything else constant and changing the value of that variable.

**Companion Variable** While the variables that determine a multiple can be extracted from a discounted cash flow model, and the relationship between each variable and the multiple can be developed by holding all else constant and asking what-if questions, there is one variable that dominates when it comes to explaining each multiple. This variable, which is called the companion variable, can usually be identified by looking at how multiples vary across firms in a sector or across the entire market. In the next three chapters, the companion variables for the most widely used multiples from the price-earnings ratio to the value-to-sales multiples are identified and then used in analysis.

# Application Tests

When multiples are used, they tend to be used in conjunction with comparable firms to determine the value of a firm or its equity. But what is a comparable firm? While the conventional practice is to look at firms within the same industry or business as comparable firms, this is not necessarily always the correct or the best way of identifying these firms. In addition, no matter how carefully you choose comparable firms, differences will remain between the firm you are valuing and the comparable firms. Figuring out how to control for these differences is a significant part of relative valuation.

What Is a Comparable Firm? A comparable firm is one with cash flows, growth potential, and risk similar to the firm being valued. It would be ideal if you could value a firm by looking at how an exactly identical firm—in terms of risk, growth, and cash flows—is priced. Nowhere in this definition is there a component that relates to the industry or sector to which a firm belongs. Thus a telecommunications firm can be compared to a software firm if the two are identical in terms of cash flows, growth, and risk. In most analyses, however, analysts define comparable firms to be other firms in the firm's business or businesses. If there are enough firms in the industry to allow for it, this list is pruned further using other criteria; for instance, only firms of similar size may be considered. The implicit assumption being made here is that firms in the same sector have similar risk, growth, and cash flow profiles and therefore can be compared with much more legitimacy.

The key question that you face in coming up with the list of comparable firms then becomes how narrowly you define a comparable firm. If you define it as a firm that looks just like the firm you are valuing on every dimension (risk, growth, and cash flows) you may find only a handful of comparable firms. If you define it more broadly and are willing to accept differences on one or all of the dimensions, your comparable firm list will be longer. If you can find ways of controlling for differences across companies (and the next section presents a few choices), you will get more reliable estimates of relative value using a larger sample of less comparable firms than a very small sample of more comparable ones.


With globalization, you are faced with a new challenge, where companies in a sector are incorporated and trade in different markets. Thus, in the automobile sector, you can have U.S., European, and Asian firms all competing for market share globally. Can you compare companies that are listed on different markets? Sure, as long as you recognize that these companies can have different risk, growth, and cash flow characteristics. Thus, Asian automobile companies may have higher growth potential and risk exposure than European firms. In addition, differences in accounting standards and currencies can skew both market and accounting numbers and have to be controlled for.

Controlling for Differences across Firms No matter how carefully you construct your list of comparable firms, you will end up with firms that are different from the firm you are valuing. The differences may be small on some variables and large on others, and you will have to control for these differences in a relative valuation. There are three ways of controlling for these differences: subjective adjustments, modified multiples, and sector or market regressions.

Subjective Adjustments Relative valuation begins with two choices—the multiple used in the analysis and the group of firms that comprises the comparable firms. The multiple is calculated for each of the comparable firms, and the average is computed. To evaluate an individual firm, you then compare the multiple it trades at to the average computed; if it is significantly different, you make a subjective judgment about whether the firm's individual characteristics (growth, risk, or cash flows) may explain the difference. Thus, a firm may have a PE ratio of 22 in a sector where the average PE is only 15, but you may conclude that this difference can be justified because the firm has higher growth potential than the average firm in the industry. If, in your judgment, the difference on the multiple cannot be explained by the fundamentals, the firm will be viewed as overvalued (if its multiple is higher than the average) or undervalued (if its multiple is lower than the average).

Modified Multiples In this approach, you modify the multiple to take into account the most important variable determining it—the companion variable. Thus, the PE ratio is divided by the expected growth rate in EPS for a company to determine a growth-adjusted PE ratio or the PEG ratio. These modified ratios are then compared across companies in a sector. The implicit assumption you make is that these firms are comparable on all the measures of value, other than the one being controlled for. In addition, you are assuming that the relationship between the multiples and fundamentals is linear.

Andres Wines undervalued on a relative basis? A simple view of multiples would lead you to conclude this because its PE ratio of 8.96 was significantly lower than the average for the industry.

In making this comparison, we are assuming that Andres Wines had growth and risk characteristics similar to the average for the sector. One way of bringing growth into the comparison is to compute the PEG ratio, which is reported in the last column. Based on the average PEG ratio of 2.00 for the sector and the estimated growth rate for Andres Wines, you obtain the following value for the PE ratio for Andres:

$$

\mathrm{PEratio} = 2.00\times 3.50\% = 7.00

$$

Based on this adjusted PE, Andres Wines looks overvalued even though it had a low PE ratio. While this may seem like an easy adjustment to resolve the problem of differences across firms, the conclusion holds only if these firms are of equivalent risk. Implicitly, this approach also assumes a linear relationship between growth rates and PE.

Sector Regressions When firms differ on more than one variable, it becomes difficult to modify the multiple to account for the differences across firms. You can run a regression of the multiple against the variables and then use this regression to find the predicted value for each firm. This approach works reasonably well when the number of comparable firms is large and the relationship between the multiple and the variables is stable. When these conditions do not hold, a few outliers can cause the coefficients to change dramatically and make the predictions much less reliable.

Since these firms differ on both risk and expected growth, a regression of PE ratios on both variables is run:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {PE} = 20.87 - 63.98 \text {Standard deviation} + 183.24 \text {Expected growth} \quad \mathrm {R} ^ {2} = 51 \% \\ [ 3. 0 1 ] [ 2. 6 3 ] \quad [ 3. 6 6 ] \\ \end{array}

$$

The numbers in brackets are t-statistics and suggest that the relationships between PE ratios and both variables in the regression are statistically significant. The R-squared indicates the percentage of the differences in PE ratios that is explained by the independent variables. Finally, the regression itself can be used to get predicted PE ratios for the companies in the list. Thus, the predicted PE ratio for Coca-Cola, based on its standard deviation of  $35.51\%$  and the expected growth rate of  $19\%$ , would be:

$$

\text {P r e d i c t e d} \mathrm {P E} _ {\text {C o c a - C o l a}} = 2 0. 8 7 - 6 3. 9 8 (. 3 5 5 1) + 1 8 3. 2 4 (. 1 9) = 3 2. 9 7

$$

Since the actual PE ratio for Coca-Cola was 44.33, this would suggest that the stock was overvalued, given how the rest of the sector was priced.

If you are uncomfortable with the assumption that the relationship between PE and growth is linear, which is what we have assumed in the preceding regression, you could either run nonlinear regressions or modify the variables in the regression to make the relationship more linear. For instance, using the  $\ln (\mathrm{growth}$  rate) instead of the growth rate in the regression yields much better-behaved residuals.

Market Regressions Searching for comparable firms within the sector in which a firm operates is fairly restrictive, especially when there are relatively few firms in the sector or when a firm operates in more than one sector. Since the definition of a comparable firm is not one that is in the same business but one that has the same growth, risk, and cash flow characteristics as the firm being analyzed, you need not restrict your choice of comparable firms to those in the same industry. The regression introduced in the previous section controls for differences on those variables that you believe cause multiples to vary across firms. Based on the variables that determine each multiple, you should be able to regress any multiple (PE, EV/EBITDA, PBV) against the variables, using all of the firms in the market in your sample. You can then use the market regression to get predicted values for individual companies. A company that trades at a PE ratio lower (higher) than the predicted PE from the market regression is undervalued (over valued) relative to the market.

The first advantage of this approach over the subjective comparison across firms in the same sector is that it does quantify, based on actual market data, the degree to which higher growth or risk should affect the multiples. It is true that these estimates can have error associated with them, but this error is a reflection of the reality that many analysts choose not to face when they make subjective judgments. Second, by looking at all firms in the market, this approach allows you to make more meaningful comparisons of firms that operate in industries with relatively few firms. Third, it allows you to examine whether all firms in an industry are under- or overvalued by estimating their values relative to other firms in the market.

# RECONCILING RELATIVE AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW VALUATIONS

The two approaches to valuation—discounted cash flow valuation and relative valuation—will generally yield different estimates of value for the same firm. Furthermore, even within relative valuation, you can arrive at different estimates of value, depending on which multiple you use and what firms you based the relative valuation on.

The differences in value between discounted cash flow valuation and relative valuation come from different views of market efficiency, or, put more precisely, market inefficiency. In discounted cash flow valuation, you assume that markets make mistakes, that they correct these mistakes over time, and that these mistakes can often occur across entire sectors or even the entire market. In relative valuation, you assume that while markets make mistakes on individual stocks, they are correct on average. In other words, when you value Adobe Systems relative to other software companies, you are assuming that the market has priced these companies correctly on average even though it might have made mistakes in the pricing of each of them individually. Thus, a stock may be overvalued on a discounted cash flow basis but undervalued on a relative basis, if the firms used in the relative valuation are all overpriced by the market. The reverse would occur, if an entire sector or market were underpriced.

# CONCLUSION

In relative valuation, you estimate the value of an asset by looking at how similar assets are priced. To make this comparison, you begin by converting prices into multiples—standardizing prices—and then comparing these multiples across firms that you define as comparable. Prices can be standardized based on earnings, book value, revenue, or sector-specific variables.


While the allure of multiples remains their simplicity, there are four steps in using them soundly. First, you have to define the multiple consistently and measure it uniformly across the firms being compared. Second, you need to have a sense of how the multiple varies across firms in the market. In other words, you need to know what a high value, a low value, and a typical value are for the multiple in question. Third, you need to identify the fundamental variables that determine each multiple and how changes in these fundamentals affect the value of the multiple. Finally, you need to find truly comparable firms and adjust for differences between the firms on fundamental characteristics.

# Earnings Multiples

Earnings multiples remain the most commonly used measures of relative value. This chapter begins with a detailed examination of the price-earnings ratio and then moves on to consider variants of the multiple—the PEG ratio and relative PE. It also looks at value multiples, and, in particular, the Enterprise Value to EBITDA multiple in the last part of the chapter. The four-step process described in Chapter 17 is used to look at each of these multiples.

# PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO

The price-earnings (PE) multiple is the most widely used and misused of all multiples. Its simplicity makes it an attractive choice in applications ranging from pricing initial public offerings to making judgments on relative value, but its relationship to a firm's financial fundamentals is often ignored, leading to significant errors in applications. This chapter provides some insight into the determinants of price-earnings ratios and how best to use them in valuation.

# Definitions of PE Ratio

The price-earnings ratio is the ratio of the market price per share to the earnings per share:

$$

\mathrm {P E} = \text {M a r k e t p r i c e p e r s h a r e / E a r n i n g s p e r s h a r e}

$$

The PE ratio is consistently defined, with the numerator being the value of equity per share and the denominator measuring earnings per share, which is a measure of equity earnings. The biggest problem with PE ratios is the variations on earnings per share used in computing the multiple. In Chapter 17, we saw that PE ratios could be computed using current earnings per share, trailing earnings per share, forward earnings per share, fully diluted earnings per share, and primary earnings per share.

Especially with high-growth (and high-risk) firms, the PE ratio can be very different depending on which measure of earnings per share is used. This can be explained by two factors:

1. The volatility in earnings per share at these firms. Forward earnings per share can be substantially higher (or lower) than trailing earnings per share, which, in turn, can be significantly different from current earnings per share.

2. Management options. Since high-growth firms tend to have far more employee options outstanding, relative to the number of shares, the differences between diluted and primary earnings per share tend to be large.

When the PE ratios of firms are compared, it is difficult to ensure that the earnings per share are uniformly estimated across the firms for the following reasons:

Firms often grow by acquiring other firms, and they do not account for acquisitions the same way. While all companies now have to use purchase accounting and record goodwill as an asset, there is enough discretion in the process to make a material difference in reported earnings. These differences lead to different measures of earnings per share and different PE ratios.
Using diluted earnings per share in estimating PE ratios might bring the shares that are covered by management options into the multiple, but they treat options that are deep in-the-money or only slightly in-the-money as equivalent.
■ Firm often have discretion in whether they expense or capitalize items, at least for reporting purposes. The expensing of a capital expense gives firms a way of shifting earnings from period to period, and penalizes those firms that are reinvesting more.

# Cross-Sectional Distribution of PE Ratios

A critical step in using PE ratios is to understand how the cross-sectional multiple is distributed across firms in the sector and the market. In this section, the distribution of PE ratios across the entire market is examined.

Market Distribution Figure 18.1 presents the distribution of PE ratios for U.S. stocks in January 2011. The current PE, trailing PE, and forward PE ratios are all presented in this figure.

Table 18.1 presents summary statistics on all three measures of the price-earnings ratio, starting with the mean and the median and the 25th and 75th percentile values. In computing these values, the PE ratio is set at 200 if it is greater than 200, to prevent outliers from having too large an influence on the summary statistics. $^{1}$

Looking at all three measures of the PE ratio, the average is consistently higher than the median, reflecting the fact that PE ratios can be very high numbers but cannot be less than zero. This asymmetry in the distributions is captured in the skewness values. The current PE ratios are also higher than the trailing PE ratios, which, in turn, are usually higher than the forward PE ratios, reflecting the fact that forward earnings are expected to be higher than trailing earnings.

# Determinants of the PE Ratio

In Chapter 17 the fundamentals that determine multiples were extracted using a discounted cash flow model—an equity model like the dividend discount model for equity multiples and a firm value model for firm multiples. The price-earnings ratio, being an equity multiple, can be analyzed using a equity valuation model. In this section, the fundamentals that determine the price-earnings ratio for a high-growth firm are analyzed.

Discounted Cash Flow Model Perspective on PE Ratios In Chapter 17 we derived the PE ratio for a stable growth firm from the stable growth dividend discount model:

$$

\frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {E P S} _ {0}} = \mathrm {P E} = \frac {\text {P a y o u t r a t i o} \times \left(1 + \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}\right)}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$

If the PE ratio is stated in terms of expected earnings in the next time period, this can be simplified to:

$$

\frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {E P S} _ {1}} = \text {F o r w a r d} \mathrm {P E} = \frac {\text {P a y o u t r a t i o}}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$

The PE ratio is an increasing function of the payout ratio and the growth rate and a decreasing function of the riskiness of the firm. In fact, we can state the payout ratio as a function of the expected growth rate and return on equity:

Payout ratio  $= 1 -$  Expected growth rate/Return on equity  $= 1 - \mathrm{g}_{\mathrm{n}} / \mathrm{ROE}_{\mathrm{n}}$

Substituting back into the equation,

$$

\frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {E P S} _ {1}} = \text {F o r w a r d} \mathrm {P E} = \frac {1 - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}} / \mathrm {R O E} _ {\mathrm {n}}}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}

$$

The price-earnings ratio for a high-growth firm can also be related to fundamentals. Using the two-stage dividend discount model, this relationship can be made explicit fairly simply. When a firm is expected to be in high growth for the next  $n$  years and stable growth thereafter, the dividend discount model can be written as follows:

$$

\begin{array}{l} P _ {0} = \frac {\mathrm {E P S} _ {0} \times \text {P a y o u t r a t i o} \times (1 + \mathrm {g}) \times \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 + \mathrm {g}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}}{(1 + \mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}} \right]}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}} - \mathrm {g}} \\ + \frac {\mathrm {E P S} _ {0} \times \text {P a y o u t r a t i o} _ {\mathrm {n}} \times (1 + \mathrm {g}) ^ {\mathrm {n}} \times (1 + \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}})}{(\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}, \mathrm {s t}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}) (1 + \mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e}, \mathrm {h g}}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}} \\ \end{array}

$$ where  $\mathrm{EPS}_0 =$  Earnings per share in year 0 (current year)

$\mathrm{g} =$  Growth rate in the first n years

$\mathrm{k}_{\mathrm{e,hg}} =$  Cost of equity in high growth period

${\mathrm{k}}_{\mathrm{e},\mathrm{{st}}} =$  Cost of equity in stable growth period

Payout = Payout ratio in the first n years

$\mathbf{g}_{\mathrm{n}} =$  Growth rate after n years, forever (stable growth rate)

$\mathrm{Payout}_{\mathrm{n}} = \mathrm{Payout}$  ratio after n years for the stable firm

Bringing  $\mathrm{EPS}_0$  to the left-hand side of the equation,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {E P S} _ {0}} = \frac {\text {P a y o u t r a t i o} \times (1 + \mathrm {g}) \times \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 + \mathrm {g}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}}{(1 + \mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}} \right]}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}} - \mathrm {g}} \\ + \frac {\text {P a y o u t r a t i o} _ {\mathrm {n}} \times (1 + \mathrm {g}) ^ {\mathrm {n}} \times (1 + \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}})}{(\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {s t}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}) (1 + \mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}} \\ \end{array}
$$

Here again, we can substitute in the fundamental equation relating ROE for payout ratios:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\mathrm {P} _ {0}}{\mathrm {E P S} _ {0}} = \frac {\left(1 - \frac {\mathrm {g}}{\mathrm {R O E} _ {\mathrm {h g}}}\right) \times (1 + \mathrm {g}) \times \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 + \mathrm {g}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}}{(1 + \mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}}) ^ {\mathrm {n}}} \right]}{\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}} - \mathrm {g}} \\ + \frac {\left(1 - \frac {\mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}}{\mathrm {R O E} _ {\mathrm {s t}}}\right) \times (1 + \mathrm {g}) ^ {\mathrm {n}} \times (1 + \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}})}{\left(\mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {s t}} - \mathrm {g} _ {\mathrm {n}}\right) \left(1 + \mathrm {k} _ {\mathrm {e} , \mathrm {h g}}\right) ^ {\mathrm {n}}} \\ \end{array}
$$ where  $\mathrm{ROE}_{\mathrm{hg}}$  is the return on equity in the high growth period and  $\mathrm{ROE}_{\mathrm{st}}$  is the return on equity in stable growth.


The left-hand side of the equation is the price-earnings ratio. It is determined by:
- Payout ratio (and return on equity) during the high growth period and in the stable period. The PE ratio increases as the payout ratio increases, for any given growth rate. An alternative way of stating the same proposition is that the PE ratio increases as the return on equity increases, for any given growth rate, and decreases as the return on equity decreases.
■ Riskiness (through the discount rate). The PE ratio becomes lower as riskiness increases. Put differently, the PE ratio will be higher for a firm where its growth is more predictable and stable than for an otherwise similar firm with unstable growth.
Expected growth rate in earnings in both the high-growth and stable phases. The PE increases as the growth rate increases, assuming that the ROE  $>$  cost of equity.

This formula is general enough to be applied to any firm, even one that is not paying dividends right now. In fact, the ratio of FCFE to earnings can be substituted for the payout ratio for firms that pay significantly less in dividends than they can afford to.

# ILLUSTRATION 18.1: Estimating the PE Ratio for a High-Growth Firm in the Two-Stage Model

Assume that you have been asked to estimate the PE ratio for a firm that has the following characteristics:

Length of high growth = five years

Growth rate in first five years  $= 25\%$

Growth rate after five years  $= 8\%$

Beta = 1.0

Cost of equity  ${}^{2} = 6\%  + 1\left( {{5.5}\% }\right)  = {11.5}\%$

Payout ratio in first five years  $= 20\%$

Payout ratio after five years  $= 50\%$

Risk-free rate  $=$  T-bond rate  $= 6\%$

Risk premium  $= 5.5\%$

$$

P E = \frac {0 . 2 \times (1 . 2 5) \times \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 . 2 5) ^ {5}}{(1 . 1 1 5) ^ {5}} \right]}{. 1 1 5 -. 2 5} + \frac {0 . 5 \times (1 . 2 5) ^ {5} \times (1 . 0 8)}{(. 1 1 5 -. 0 8) (1 . 1 1 5) ^ {5}} = 2 8. 7 5

$$

The estimated PE ratio for this firm is 28.75. Note that the return on equity implicit in these inputs can also be computed as follows:

Return on equity in first five years  $=$  Growth rate/(1 - Payout ratio)  $= .25 / .8 = 31.25\%$

Return on equity in stable growth  $= .08 / .5 = 16\%$

# ILLUSTRATION 18.2: Estimating an Intrinsic PE Ratio—P&G in May 2011

In Chapter 13, we valued P&G using a two-stage dividend discount model. We reproduce the inputs that we used in the valuation in the following table:

<table><tr><td></td><td>High Growth</td><td>Stable Growth</td></tr><tr><td>Length of growth</td><td>5 years</td><td>After year 5</td></tr><tr><td>Expected growth rate</td><td>10.00\%</td><td>3.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Payout ratio</td><td>50.00\%</td><td>75.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of equity</td><td>8.00\%</td><td>8.50\%</td></tr></table>

Note that we derived the payout ratio in stable growth from the stable growth rate and the stable period ROE:

$$

\text{Stable payout ratio} = 1 - 3 \% / 12 \% = 75 \%

$$

We plug these values into the two-stage PE ratio equation:

$$

P E = \frac {(0 . 5 0) (1 . 1 0) \left(1 - \frac {(1 . 1 0) ^ {5}}{(1 . 0 8) ^ {5}}\right)}{(0 . 0 8 - 0 . 1 0)} + \frac {(0 . 7 5) (1 . 1 0) ^ {5} (1 . 0 3)}{(0 . 0 8 5 - 0 . 0 3) (1 . 0 8) ^ {5}} = 1 8. 0 4

$$

Based on its fundamentals, we would expect P&G to trade at 18.04 times earnings. Not surprisingly, multiplying this intrinsic PE ratio by the current EPS of  \$3.82 yields\$ 68.90, the same value that we estimated using the two-stage dividend discount model in Chapter 13.

PE Ratios and Expected Extraordinary Growth The PE ratio of a high growth firm is a function of the expected extraordinary growth rate—the higher the expected growth, the higher the PE ratio for a firm. In Illustration 18.1, for instance, the PE ratio that was estimated to be 28.75, with a growth rate of 25 percent, will change as that expected growth rate changes. Figure 18.2 graphs the PE ratio as a function of the expected growth rate during the high growth period. As the firm's expected growth rate in the first five years declines from 25 percent to 5 percent, the PE ratio for the firm also decreases from 28.75 to just above 10.

The effect of changes in the expected growth rate varies depending on the level of interest rates. In Figure 18.3, the PE ratios are estimated for different expected growth rates at four levels of riskless rates—4 percent, 6 percent, 8 percent, and 10 percent.

The PE ratio is much more sensitive to changes in expected growth rates when interest rates are low than when they are high. The reason is simple. Growth produces cash flows in the future, and the present value of these cash flows is much smaller at high interest rates. Consequently, the effect of changes in the growth rate on the present value tends to be smaller.

There is a possible link between this finding and how markets react to earnings surprises from high growth firms. When a firm reports earnings that are significantly higher than expected (a positive surprise) or lower than expected (a negative surprise), investors' perceptions of the expected growth rate for this firm can change concurrently, leading to a value effect. You would expect to see much greater price reactions for a given earnings surprise, positive or negative, in a low-interest-rate environment than you would in a high-interest-rate environment.

FIGURE 18.3 PE Ratios and Expected Growth: Interest Rate Scenarios

PE Ratios and Risk The PE ratio is a function of the perceived risk of a firm, and the effect shows up in the cost of equity. A firm with a higher cost of equity will trade at a lower multiple of earnings than a similar firm with a lower cost of equity.

Again, the effect of higher risk on PE ratios can be seen using the firm in Illustration 18.1. Recall that the firm, which has an expected growth rate of 25 percent for the next five years and 8 percent thereafter, has an estimated PE ratio of 28.75, if its beta is assumed to be 1.

$$

\mathrm {P E} = \frac {0 . 2 \times (1 . 2 5) \times \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 . 2 5) ^ {5}}{(1 . 1 1 5) ^ {5}} \right]}{. 1 1 5 -. 2 5} + \frac {0 . 5 \times (1 . 2 5) ^ {5} \times (1 . 0 8)}{(. 1 1 5 -. 0 8) (1 . 1 1 5) ^ {5}} = 2 8. 7 5

$$

If you assume that the beta is 1.5, the cost of equity increases to 14.25 percent, leading to a PE ratio of 14.87:

$$

\mathrm {P E} = \frac {0 . 2 \times (1 . 2 5) \times \left[ 1 - \frac {(1 . 2 5) ^ {5}}{(1 . 1 4 2 5) ^ {5}} \right]}{. 1 4 2 5 -. 2 5} + \frac {0 . 5 \times (1 . 2 5) ^ {5} \times (1 . 0 8)}{(. 1 4 2 5 -. 0 8) (1 . 1 4 2 5) ^ {5}} = 1 4. 8 7

$$

The higher cost of equity reduces the value created by expected growth.

In Figure 18.4, you can see the impact of changing the beta on the price earnings ratio for four high growth scenarios—8 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent, and 25 percent for the next five years.

FIGURE 18.4 PE Ratios and Beta: Growth Rate Scenarios

As the beta increases, the PE ratio decreases in all four scenarios. However, the difference between the PE ratios across the four growth classes is less when the beta is very high, and increases as the beta decreases. This would suggest that at very high risk levels, a firm's PE ratio is likely to increase more as the risk decreases than as growth increases. For many high-growth firms that are viewed as both very risky and having good growth potential, reducing risk may increase value much more than increasing expected growth.

# Using the PE Ratio for Comparisons

Now that we have defined the PE ratio, looked at the cross-sectional distribution, and examined the fundamentals that determine the multiple, we can use PE ratios to make valuation judgments. This section begins by looking at how best to compare the PE ratio for a market over time and follows up by a comparison of PE ratios across different markets. Finally, it uses PE ratios to analyze firms within a sector and then expands the analysis to the entire market. In doing so, note that PE ratios vary across time, markets, industries, and firms because of differences in fundamentals—higher growth, lower risk, and higher payout generally result in higher PE ratios. When comparisons are made, you have to control for these differences in risk, growth rates, and payout ratios.

Comparing a Market's PE Ratio across Time Analysts and market strategists often compare the PE ratio of a market to its historical average to make judgments about whether the market is under- or overvalued. Thus a market that is trading at a PE ratio is much higher than its historical norms is often considered to be overvalued, whereas one that is trading at a ratio lower than its historical norms is considered undervalued.

While reversion to historic norms remains a very strong force in financial markets, you should be cautious about drawing too strong a conclusion from such comparisons. As the fundamentals (interest rates, risk premiums, expected growth, and payout) change over time, the PE ratio will also change. Other things remaining equal, for instance, you would expect the following:

An increase in interest rates should result in a higher cost of equity for the market and a lower PE ratio.
A greater willingness to take risk on the part of investors will result in a lower risk premium for equity and a higher PE ratio across all stocks.
■ An increase in expected growth in earnings across firms will result in a higher PE ratio for the market.
An increase in the return on equity at firms will result in a higher payout ratio for any given growth rate  $\left[\mathrm{g} = (1 - \text{Payout ratio})\mathrm{ROE}\right]$  and a higher PE ratio for all firms.

In other words, it is difficult to draw conclusions about PE ratios without looking at these fundamentals. A more appropriate comparison is therefore not between PE ratios across time, but between the actual PE ratio and the predicted PE ratio based on fundamentals existing at that time.

# ILLUSTRATION 18.3: PE Ratios across Time

The following are the summary economic statistics at two points in time for the same stock market. The interest rates in the first period were significantly higher than the interest rates in the second period.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Period 1</td><td>Period 2</td></tr><tr><td>T-bond rate</td><td>11.00\%</td><td>6.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Market premium</td><td>5.50\%</td><td>5.50\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected inflation</td><td>5.00\%</td><td>4.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected growth in real GNP</td><td>3.00\%</td><td>2.50\%</td></tr><tr><td>Average payout ratio</td><td>50\%</td><td>50\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected PE ratio</td><td>(0.5 × 1.08)/(.165 - .08) = 6.35</td><td>(0.5 × 1.065)/(.115 - .065) = 10.65</td></tr></table>

The PE ratio in the second time period is significantly higher than the PE ratio in the first period, largely because of the drop in real interest rates (nominal interest rate - expected inflation).

# ILLUSTRATION 18.4: PE Ratios across Time for the S&P 500

Figure 18.5 summarizes the earnings-price (EP) ratios for S&P 500 and Treasury bond rates at the end of each year from 1960 to 2010. There is a strong positive relationship between EP ratios and T-bond rates, as evidenced by the correlation of 0.665 between the two variables. In addition, there is evidence that the term structure also affects the PE ratio. In the following regression, we regress EP ratios against the level of T-bond rates and the yield spread (T-bond minus T-bill rate), using data from 1960 to 2010.

$$

\begin{array}{l} E P = 0. 0 2 6 1 + 0. 6 8 6 9 T - b o n d r a t e - 0. 3 6 5 5 (T - b o n d r a t e - T - b i l l r a t e) \quad R ^ {2} = 0. 4 7 8 \\ [ 3. 2 8 ] \quad [ 6. 4 1 ] \quad [ 1. 5 0 ] \\ \end{array}

$$

Other things remaining equal, this regression suggests that:

Every  $1\%$  increase in the T-bond rate increases the EP ratio by  $0.6869\%$ . This is not surprising, but it quantifies the impact that higher interest rates have on the PE ratio.
Every  $1\%$  increase in the difference between T-bond and T-bill rates reduces the EP ratio by  $0.3655\%$ . Flatter or negatively sloping term yield curves seem to correspond to lower PE ratios, and upwardly sloping yield curves to higher PE ratios. While at first sight this may seem surprising, the slope of the yield curve, at least in the United States, has been a leading indicator of economic growth, with more upwardly sloped curves going with higher growth.

Based on this regression, the predicted EP ratio at the beginning of 2011, with the T-bill rate at  $0.13\%$  and the T-bond rate at  $3.29\%$ , would have been:

$$

\begin{array}{l} E P _ {2 0 0 0} = 0. 0 2 6 + 0. 6 8 6 9 (. 0 3 2 9) - 0. 3 6 5 5 (. 0 0 1 3) = 0. 0 4 8 1 \\ \mathrm {P E} _ {2 0 0 0} = 1 / \mathrm {E P} _ {2 0 1 0} = 1 / . 0 4 8 1 = 2 0. 7 7 \\ \end{array}

$$

Since the S&P 500 was trading at a multiple of 15 times earnings in early 2011, this would have indicated an undervalued market. This regression can be enriched by adding other variables that should be correlated to the price-earnings ratio, such as expected growth in gross national product (GNP) and payout ratios, as independent variables. In fact, an argument can be made that the influx of technology stocks into the S&P 500 over the past two decades, the increase in return on equity at U.S. companies over the same period, and a decline in risk premiums could all explain the increase in PE ratios over the period.

FIGURE 18.5 EP Ratios and Interest Rates: 1960 to 2010


Comparing PE Ratios across Countries Comparisons are often made between price-earnings ratios in different countries with the intention of finding undervalued and overvalued markets. Markets with lower PE ratios are viewed as undervalued and those with higher PE ratios are considered overvalued. Given the wide differences that exist between countries on fundamentals, it is misleading to draw these conclusions. For instance, you would expect to see the following, other things remaining equal:

Countries with higher real interest rates should have lower PE ratios than countries with lower real interest rates.
Countries with higher expected real growth should have higher PE ratios than countries with lower real growth.
- Countries that are viewed as riskier (and thus command higher risk premiums) should have lower PE ratios than safer countries.
- Countries where companies are more efficient in their investments (and earn a higher return on these investments) should trade at higher PE ratios.

# ILLUSTRATION 18.5: PE Ratios in Markets with Different Fundamentals

The following are the summary economic statistics for stock markets in two different countries—country 1 and country 2. The key difference between the two countries is that interest rates are much higher in country 1.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Country 1</td><td>Country 2</td></tr><tr><td>T-bond rate</td><td>10.00\%</td><td>5.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Market premium</td><td>4.00\%</td><td>5.50\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected inflation</td><td>4.00\%</td><td>4.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected growth in real GNP</td><td>2.00\%</td><td>3.00\%</td></tr><tr><td>Average payout ratio</td><td>50\%</td><td>50\%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected PE ratio</td><td>(0.5 × 1.06)/(.14 - .06) = 6.625</td><td>(0.5 × 1.07)/(.105 - .07) = 15.29</td></tr></table>

In this case, the expected PE ratio in country 2 is significantly higher than the PE ratio in country 1, but it can be justified on the basis of differences in financial fundamentals. (Note that nominal growth = real growth rate + expected inflation.)

# ILLUSTRATION 18.6: Comparing PE Ratios across Markets—July 2000

This principle can be extended to broader comparisons of PE ratios across countries. The following table summarizes PE ratios across different developed markets in July 2000, together with dividend yields and interest rates (short-term and long-term) at that time:

<table><tr><td>Country</td><td>PE</td><td>Dividend Yield</td><td>2-Year Rate</td><td>10-Year Rate</td><td>10-Year – 2-Year</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>22.02</td><td>2.59\%</td><td>5.93\%</td><td>5.85\%</td><td>-0.08\%</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>26.33</td><td>1.88\%</td><td>5.06\%</td><td>5.32\%</td><td>0.26\%</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>29.04</td><td>1.34\%</td><td>5.11\%</td><td>5.48\%</td><td>0.37\%</td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland</td><td>19.60</td><td>1.42\%</td><td>3.62\%</td><td>3.83\%</td><td>0.21\%</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>14.74</td><td>2.66\%</td><td>5.15\%</td><td>5.70\%</td><td>0.55\%</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>28.23</td><td>1.76\%</td><td>5.27\%</td><td>5.70\%</td><td>0.43\%</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>32.39</td><td>1.11\%</td><td>4.67\%</td><td>5.26\%</td><td>0.59\%</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>21.10</td><td>2.07\%</td><td>5.10\%</td><td>5.47\%</td><td>0.37\%</td></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>21.69</td><td>3.12\%</td><td>6.29\%</td><td>6.25\%</td><td>-0.04\%</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>52.25</td><td>0.71\%</td><td>0.58\%</td><td>1.85\%</td><td>1.27\%</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>25.14</td><td>1.10\%</td><td>6.05\%</td><td>5.85\%</td><td>-0.20\%</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>26.14</td><td>0.99\%</td><td>5.70\%</td><td>5.77\%</td><td>0.07\%</td></tr></table>

A naive comparison of PE ratios suggests that Japanese stocks, with a PE ratio of 52.25, were overvalued, while Belgian stocks, with a PE ratio of 14.74, are undervalued. There were, however, a strong negative correlation between PE ratios and 10-year interest rates  $(- .73)$  and a positive correlation between the PE ratio and the spread between long and short term rates (.70). A cross-sectional regression of PE ratio on interest rates and expected growth yields the following:

$$

\begin{array}{c} \text {PE ratio} = 42.62 - 360.910\text{-year rate} +846.61(10\text{-year rate} -2\text{-year rate})\\ [ 2.78][1.41][1.08] \end{array} \quad R ^ {2} = 59\%

$$

The coefficients are of marginal significance, partly because of the small size of the sample. Based on this regression, the predicted PE ratios for the countries are shown in the following table:

<table><tr><td>Country</td><td>Actual PE</td><td>Predicted PE</td><td>Under- or Overvalued</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>22.02</td><td>20.83</td><td>5.71\%</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>26.33</td><td>25.62</td><td>2.76\%</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>29.04</td><td>25.98</td><td>11.80\%</td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland</td><td>19.60</td><td>30.58</td><td>-35.90\%</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>14.74</td><td>26.71</td><td>-44.81\%</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>28.23</td><td>25.69</td><td>9.89\%</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>32.39</td><td>28.63</td><td>13.12\%</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>21.10</td><td>26.01</td><td>-18.88\%</td></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>21.69</td><td>19.73</td><td>9.96\%</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>52.25</td><td>46.70</td><td>11.89\%</td></tr><tr><td>United States</td><td>25.14</td><td>19.81</td><td>26.88\%</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>26.14</td><td>22.39</td><td>16.75\%</td></tr></table>

From this comparison, Belgian and Swiss stocks would be the most undervalued, while U.S. stocks would have been the most overvalued.

# ILLUSTRATION 18.7: An Example with Emerging Markets—End of 2000

This example is extended to examine PE ratio differences across emerging markets at the end of 2000. In this table, the country risk factor is that estimated by the Economist for these emerging markets, scaled from 0 (safest) to 100 (riskiest).

<table><tr><td>Country</td><td>PE Ratio</td><td>Interest Rate</td><td>GDP Real Growth</td><td>Country Risk</td></tr><tr><td>Argentina</td><td>14</td><td>18.00\%</td><td>2.50\%</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Brazil</td><td>21</td><td>14.00\%</td><td>4.80\%</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Chile</td><td>25</td><td>9.50\%</td><td>5.50\%</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Hong Kong</td><td>20</td><td>8.00\%</td><td>6.00\%</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>India</td><td>17</td><td>11.48\%</td><td>4.20\%</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Indonesia</td><td>15</td><td>21.00\%</td><td>4.00\%</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Malaysia</td><td>14</td><td>5.67\%</td><td>3.00\%</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Mexico</td><td>19</td><td>11.50\%</td><td>5.50\%</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Pakistan</td><td>14</td><td>19.00\%</td><td>3.00\%</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Peru</td><td>15</td><td>18.00\%</td><td>4.90\%</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Philippines</td><td>15</td><td>17.00\%</td><td>3.80\%</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Singapore</td><td>24</td><td>6.50\%</td><td>5.20\%</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>South Korea</td><td>21</td><td>10.00\%</td><td>4.80\%</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Thailand</td><td>21</td><td>12.75\%</td><td>5.50\%</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Turkey</td><td>12</td><td>25.00\%</td><td>2.00\%</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Venezuela</td><td>20</td><td>15.00\%</td><td>3.50\%</td><td>45</td></tr></table>

The regression of PE ratios on these variables provides the following:

$$

\begin{array}{c} \text {PE} = 16.16 - 7.94 \text {Interest rates} + 154.40 \text {Real growth} - 0.112 \text {Country risk} \\ [ 3.61 ] \quad [ 0.52 ] \quad [ 2.38 ] \quad [ 1.78 ] \end{array} \quad R ^ {2} = 74 \%

$$

Countries with higher real growth and lower country risk have higher PE ratios, but the level of interest rates seems to have only a marginal impact. The regression can be used to estimate the price-earnings ratio for Turkey:

$$

\text {P r e d i c t e d P E f o r T u r k e y} = 1 6. 1 6 - 7. 9 4 (. 2 5) + 1 5 4. 4 0 (. 0 2) - 0. 1 1 2 (3 5) = 1 3. 3 5 4

$$

At a PE ratio of 12, the market would have been viewed as slightly undervalued.

Comparing PE Ratios across Firms in a Sector The most common approach to estimating the PE ratio for a firm is to choose a group of comparable firms, to calculate the average PE ratio for this group, and to subjectively adjust this average for differences between the firm being valued and the comparable firms. There are several problems with this approach. First, the definition of a comparable firm is essentially a subjective one. The use of other firms in the industry as the control group is often not the solution because firms within the same industry can have very different business mixes and risk and growth profiles. There is also plenty of potential for bias. One clear example of this is in takeovers, where a high PE ratio for the target firm is justified using the price-earnings ratios of a control group of other firms that have been taken over. This group is designed to give an upwardly biased estimate of the PE ratio and other multiples. Second, even when a legitimate group of comparable firms can be constructed, differences will continue to persist in fundamentals between the firm being valued and this group. It is very difficult to subjectively adjust for differences across firms. Thus, knowing that a firm has much higher growth potential than other firms in the comparable firm list would lead you to estimate a higher PE ratio for that firm, but how much higher is an open question.


The alternative to subjective adjustments is to control explicitly for the one or two variables that you believe account for the bulk of the differences in PE ratios across companies in the sector in a regression. The regression equation can then be used to estimate predicted PE ratios for each firm in the sector, and these predicted values can be compared to the actual PE ratios to make judgments on whether stocks are under- or overpriced.

# ILLUSTRATION 18.8: Comparing PE Ratios for Global Telecom Firms—September 2000

The following table summarizes the trailing PE ratios for global telecom firms with American depositary receipts (ADRs) listed in the United States in September 2000. The earnings per share used are those estimated using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and thus should be much more directly comparable than the earnings reported by these firms in their local markets.

The earnings per share represent trailing earnings, and the price-earnings ratios for the firms are reported in the second column. The analyst estimates of expected growth in earnings per share over the next five years are shown in the next column. In the last column, we introduce a dummy variable indicating whether the firm is from an emerging market or a developed one, since emerging market telecom firms are likely to be exposed to far more risk. Not surprisingly, the firms with the lowest PE ratios, such as Telebras and PT Indosat, are from emerging markets.


Regressing the PE ratio for the sector against the expected growth rate and the emerging market dummy yields the following results:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \text {PE r a t i o} = 13.12 + 121.22 \text {E x p e c t e d g r o w t h - 1 3 . 8 5 E m e r g i n g m a r k e t d u m m y} \\ [ 3.78 ] \quad [ 6.29 ] \quad [ 3.84 ] \end{array} \quad R ^ {2} = 66 \%

$$

Firms with higher growth have significantly higher PE ratios than firms with lower expected growth. In addition, this regression indicates that an emerging market telecom firm should trade at a much lower PE ratio than one in a developed market. Using this regression to get predicted values, we get:

<table><tr><td>Company Name</td><td>PE</td><td>Predicted PE</td><td>Under- or Overvalued</td></tr><tr><td>APT Satellite Holdings ADR</td><td>31.00</td><td>39.27</td><td>-21.05\%</td></tr><tr><td>Asia Satellite Telecom Holdings ADR</td><td>19.60</td><td>18.66</td><td>5.05\%</td></tr><tr><td>British Telecommunications PLC ADR</td><td>25.70</td><td>21.60</td><td>18.98\%</td></tr><tr><td>Cable &amp; Wireless PLC ADR</td><td>29.80</td><td>30.09</td><td>-0.95\%</td></tr><tr><td>Deutsche Telekom AG ADR</td><td>24.60</td><td>26.45</td><td>-6.99\%</td></tr><tr><td>France Telecom SA ADR</td><td>45.20</td><td>36.15</td><td>25.04\%</td></tr><tr><td>Gilat Communications</td><td>22.70</td><td>36.84</td><td>-38.38\%</td></tr><tr><td>Hellenic Telecommunication Organization SA ADR</td><td>12.80</td><td>13.81</td><td>-7.31\%</td></tr><tr><td>Korea Telecom ADR</td><td>71.30</td><td>52.60</td><td>35.55\%</td></tr><tr><td>Matav RT ADR</td><td>21.50</td><td>25.93</td><td>-17.09\%</td></tr><tr><td>Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone ADR</td><td>44.30</td><td>37.36</td><td>18.58\%</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal Telecom SA ADR</td><td>20.80</td><td>28.87</td><td>-27.96\%</td></tr><tr><td>PT Indosat ADR</td><td>7.80</td><td>6.54</td><td>19.35\%</td></tr><tr><td>Royal KPN NV ADR</td><td>35.70</td><td>28.87</td><td>23.64\%</td></tr><tr><td>Swisscom AG ADR</td><td>18.30</td><td>26.45</td><td>-30.81\%</td></tr><tr><td>Tele Danmark AS ADR</td><td>27.00</td><td>24.03</td><td>12.38\%</td></tr><tr><td>Telebras ADR</td><td>8.90</td><td>8.35</td><td>6.54\%</td></tr><tr><td>Telecom Argentina ADR B</td><td>12.50</td><td>8.96</td><td>39.51\%</td></tr><tr><td>Telecom Corporation of New Zealand ADR</td><td>11.20</td><td>26.45</td><td>-57.66\%</td></tr><tr><td>Telecom Italia SPA ADR</td><td>42.20</td><td>30.09</td><td>40.26\%</td></tr><tr><td>Telecomunicaciones de Chile ADR</td><td>16.60</td><td>8.96</td><td>85.27\%</td></tr><tr><td>Telefonica SA ADR</td><td>32.50</td><td>34.94</td><td>-6.97\%</td></tr><tr><td>Telefonos de Mexico ADR L</td><td>21.10</td><td>16.23</td><td>29.98\%</td></tr><tr><td>Telekomunikasi Indonesia ADR</td><td>28.40</td><td>38.05</td><td>-25.37\%</td></tr><tr><td>Telstra ADR</td><td>21.70</td><td>27.66</td><td>-21.55\%</td></tr></table>

Based on the predicted PE ratios, Telecom Corporation of New Zealand is the most undervalued firm in this group and Telecom unicaciones de Chile is the most overvalued firm.

Comparing PE Ratios across Firms in the Market In the preceding section, comparable firms were narrowly defined to be other firms in the same business. This section considers ways in which we can expand the number of comparable firms by looking at an entire sector or even the market. There are two advantages in doing this. The first is that the estimates may become more precise as the number of comparable firms increase. The second is that it allows you to pinpoint when firms in a small subgroup are being under- or overvalued relative to the rest of the sector or the market. Since the differences across firms will increase when you loosen the definition of comparable firms, you have to adjust for these differences. The simplest way of doing this is with a multiple regression, with the PE ratio as the dependent variable, and proxies for risk, growth, and payout forming the independent variables.


Past Studies One of the earliest regressions of PE ratios against fundamentals across the entire market was done by Kisor and Whitbeck in 1963. Using data from the Bank of New York as of June 1962 for 135 stocks, they arrived at the following regression:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {P E} = 8. 2 + 1. 5 \text {(G r o w t h r a t e i n e a r n i n g s)} + 6. 7 \text {(P a y o u t r a t i o)} \\ - . 2 \text {(S t a n d a r d} \\ \end{array}

$$

Cragg and Malkiel followed up by estimating the coefficients for a regression of the price-earnings ratio on the growth rate, the payout ratio, and the beta for stocks for the time period from 1961 to 1965.

<table><tr><td>Year</td><td>Equation</td><td>R-Squared</td></tr><tr><td>1961</td><td>PE = 4.73 + 3.28 g + 2.05 π - 0.85 β</td><td>0.70</td></tr><tr><td>1962</td><td>PE = 11.06 + 1.75 g + 0.78 π - 1.61 β</td><td>0.70</td></tr><tr><td>1963</td><td>PE = 2.94 + 2.55 g + 7.62 π - 0.27 β</td><td>0.75</td></tr><tr><td>1964</td><td>PE = 6.71 + 2.05 g + 5.23 π - 0.89 β</td><td>0.75</td></tr><tr><td>1965</td><td>PE = 0.96 + 2.74 g + 5.01 π - 0.35 β</td><td>0.85</td></tr></table> where  $\mathrm{PE} =$  Price-earnings ratio at the start of the year


$\mathrm{g} =$  Growth rate in earnings

$\pi =$  Earnings payout ratio at the start of the year

$\beta =$  Beta of the stock

They concluded that while such models were useful in explaining PE ratios, they were of little use in predicting performance. In both these studies, the three variables used—payout, risk, and growth—represent the three variables that were identified as the determinants of PE ratios in an earlier section.

The regressions were updated from 1987 to 1991 in the first edition of this book using a much broader sample of stocks. The results are summarized as follows:

<table><tr><td>Year</td><td>Regression</td><td>R-Squared</td></tr><tr><td>1987</td><td>PE = 7.1839 + 13.05 Payout - 0.6259 Beta + 6.5659 EGR</td><td>0.9287</td></tr><tr><td>1988</td><td>PE = 2.5848 + 29.91 Payout - 4.5157 Beta + 19.9143 EGR</td><td>0.9465</td></tr><tr><td>1989</td><td>PE = 4.6122 + 59.74 Payout - 0.7546 Beta + 9.0072 EGR</td><td>0.5613</td></tr><tr><td>1990</td><td>PE = 3.5955 + 10.88 Payout - 0.2801 Beta + 5.4573 EGR</td><td>0.3497</td></tr><tr><td>1991</td><td>PE = 2.7711 + 22.89 Payout - 0.1326 Beta + 13.8653 EGR</td><td>0.3217</td></tr></table> where EGR is a historical growth rate in EPS. Note the volatility in the R-squared over time and the changes in the coefficients on the independent variables. For instance, the R-squared in the regressions reported declines from 0.93 in 1987 to


0.32 in 1991, and the coefficients change dramatically over time. Part of the reason for these shifts is that earnings are volatile, and price-earnings ratios reflect this volatility. The low R-squared for the 1991 regression can be ascribed to the recession's effects on earnings in that year. These regressions are clearly not stable, and the predicted values are likely to be noisy.

Updated Market Regressions The data needed to run market regressions is much more easily available today than it was for these earlier studies. In this section, the results of two regressions are presented. In the first regression, run in January 2011, the PE ratio was regressed against payout ratios, betas, and expected growth for all firms in the market:4

$$

\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {P E} = - 6. 3 7 + 8 3. 5 6 (\text {E x p e c t e d g r o w t h r a t e}) + 5. 0 6 (\text {B e t a}) + 5. 8 3 (\text {P a y o u t r a t i o}) \\ [ 5. 8 5 ] [ 1 6. 9 3 ] \quad [ 8. 1 8 ] \quad [ 4. 2 9 ] \\ R \text {- squared} = 19.8 \% \quad \text {Number of observations} = 1,608 \\ \end{array}

$$

With the sample size about 1,600 firms, this regression represents the broadest measure of relative value.

This regression has a low R-squared, but it is more a reflection of the noise in PE ratios than it is on the regression methodology. As you will see, the market regressions for price-to-book value and price-to-sales ratios tend to be better behaved and have a higher R-squared than PE ratio regressions. The other disquieting finding is that the coefficients on the variables do not always have the signs you would expect them to have. For instance, higher-risk stocks (higher betas) have higher PE ratios, when fundamentals would lead you to expect the opposite.

The coefficient on the expected growth rate in the regressions offers some useful insight into how the market is pricing growth differences across stocks. In the following table, we report this number each year from January 2000 to January 2011, in conjunction with the implied equity risk premiums that we computed in Chapter 7 (as a price of risk):

<table><tr><td>Time

${}^{1}$  Significant at 1\% level.

In January 2000, at the peak of the dot-com boom, the market was paying a very high price for growth, while charging very little for risk; not surprisingly, high-growth, high-risk firms traded at sky-high PE ratios. By January 2002, the wheel had turned, with the price for growth dropping by more than 50 percent and the price of risk increasing almost 80 percent. In January 2009, right after the banking crisis, the market price for risk was 6.43 percent (the highest level in 30 years), and the price paid for growth was low; the median PE ratio for U.S. firms was in single digits as a consequence.

Problems with the Regression Methodology The regression methodology is a convenient way of compressing large amounts of data into one equation capturing the relationship between PE ratios and financial fundamentals. But it does have its limitations. First, the independent variables are correlated with each other. For example, high-growth firms tend to have high risk and low payout ratios, as is clear from Table 18.2, which summarizes the correlations between beta, growth, and payout ratios for all U.S. firms. Note the negative correlation between payout ratios and growth, and the positive correlation between beta and growth. This multicollinearity makes the coefficients of the regressions unreliable (increased standard error) and may explain the wrong signs on the coefficients (such as beta having a positive coefficient) and the large changes in these coefficients from period to period. Second, the regression is based on a linear relationship between PE ratios and the fundamentals, and that might not be appropriate. An analysis of the residuals from a regression may suggest transformations of the independent variables (squared or natural logs) that work better in explaining PE ratios. Third, the basic relationship between PE ratios and financial variables itself is not stable, and if it shifts from year to year, the predictions from the regression equation may not be reliable for extended periods. For all these reasons, the regression approach is useful but it has to be viewed as one more tool in the search for true value.

# ILLUSTRATION 18.9: Valuing Procter & Gamble (P&G) Using the Market Regression

In an earlier illustration, we estimated a PE ratio for P&G from fundamentals. To value P&G using the broader regressions, you would first have to estimate the values, for P&G, of the independent variables in the regression:

P&G's beta = 0.90

P&G's payout ratio  $= 50.00\%$

P&G's expected growth rate  $= 10.00\%$

Note that these variables have been defined consistently with the variables in the regression. Thus, the growth rate over the next five years, the beta over the past five years, and the payout ratio over the most recent four quarters are used to make the prediction. Based on the price-earnings ratio regression for all stocks in the market, you would get a predicted PE ratio of:

$$

\begin{array}{r l} \text {P r e d i c t e d P E} _ {\mathrm {P} \& \mathrm {G}} & = 6. 3 7 + 8 3. 5 6 (\text {G r o w t h}) + 1 6. 4 4 (\text {B e t a}) + 5. 8 3 (\text {P a y o u t}) \\ & = 6. 3 7 + 8 3. 5 6 (0. 1 0) + 5. 8 3 (0. 9 0) + 5. 0 6 (0. 5 0) = 2 2. 5 0 \end{array}

$$

Based on the market regression, you would expect P&G to be trading at 22.50 times earnings. At its actual PE ratio of 18, the stock looks undervalued, relative to the market.

# NORMALIZING EARNINGS FOR PE RATIOS

The dependence of PE ratios on current earnings makes them particularly vulnerable to the year-to-year swings that often characterize reported earnings. In making comparisons, therefore, it may make much more sense to use normalized earnings. The process used to normalize earnings varies widely, but the most common approach is a simple averaging of earnings across time. For a cyclical firm, for instance, you would average the earnings per share across a cycle. In doing so, you should adjust for inflation. If you do decide to normalize earnings for the firm you are valuing, consistency demands that you normalize them for the comparable firms in the sample as well.

# THE PEG RATIO

Portfolio managers and analysts sometimes compare PE ratios to the expected growth rate to identify undervalued and overvalued stocks. In the simplest form of this approach, firms with PE ratios less than their expected growth rate are viewed as undervalued. In its more general form, the ratio of PE ratio to growth (PEG) is used as a measure of relative value, with a lower value believed to indicate that a firm is undervalued. For many analysts, especially those tracking firms in high-growth sectors, these approaches offer the promise of a way of controlling for differences in growth across firms, while preserving the inherent simplicity of a multiple.

# Definition of PEG Ratio

The PEG ratio is defined to be the price-earnings ratio divided by the expected growth rate in earnings per share:

For instance, a firm with a PE ratio of 20 and a growth rate of 10 percent is estimated to have a PEG ratio of 2. Consistency requires that the growth rate used in this estimate be the growth rate in earnings per share rather than operating income, because PEG ratio is an equity multiple.

Given the many definitions of the PE ratio, which one should you use to estimate the PEG ratio? The answer depends on the base on which the expected growth rate is computed. If the expected growth rate in earnings per share is based on earnings in the most recent year (current earnings), the PE ratio that should be used is the current PE ratio. If it is based on trailing earnings, the PE ratio used should be the trailing PE ratio. The forward PE ratio should never be used in this computation, since it may result in a double counting of growth. To see why, assume that you have a firm with a current price of  \$30 and current earnings per share of\$ 1.50. The firm is expected to double its earnings per share over the next year (forward earnings per share will be 3.00) and then have earnings growth of 5 percent a year for the following four years. An analyst estimating growth in earnings per share for this firm, with the current earnings per share as a base, will estimate a growth rate of 19.44\%:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \text {E x p e c t e d} = \left[ \left(1 + \text {G r o w t h} \text {r a t e} _ {\text {y e a r 1}}\right) \left(1 + \text {G r o w t h} \text {r a t e} _ {\text {y e a r s 2 - 5}}\right) ^ {4} \right] ^ {1 / 5} - 1 \\ = [ 2. 0 0 (1. 0 5) ^ {4} ] ^ {1 / 5} - 1 = . 1 9 4 4 \\ \end{array}

$$

If you used the forward PE ratio and this estimate of earnings growth to estimate the PEG ratio, you would get:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {P E G r a t i o} = \text {F o r w a r d P E / E x p e c t e d g r o w t h} _ {\text {n e x t 5 y e a r s}} \\ = (\text {P r i c e / F o r w a r d E P S}) / \text {E x p e c t e d g r o w t h} _ {\text {n e x t 5 y e a r s}} \\ = (\$ 30 / \$ 3) / 1 9. 4 4 = 0. 5 1 \\ \end{array}

$$

On a PEG ratio basis, this firm seems to be cheap. Note, however, that the growth in the first year has been counted twice—the forward earnings are high because of the doubling of earnings, leading to a low forward PE ratio, and the growth rate is high for the same reason. A consistent estimate of the PEG ratio would require using a current PE and the expected growth rate over the next five years:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \text {P E G r a t i o b a s o n} \mathrm {P E} = (\text {P r i c e / C u r r e n t E P S}) / \text {E x p e c t e d g r o w t h r a t e} _ {\text {n e x t 5 y e a r s}} \\ = (\$ 30 / \$ 1.50) / 19.44 = 1.03 \\ \end{array}

$$

Alternatively, you could compute the PEG ratio based on forward earnings per share and the growth rate from years 2 through 5:

$$

\begin{array}{l} \text {P E G r a t i o b a s e d o n f o r w a r d P E} = (\text {P r i c e / F o r w a r d E P S}) / \text {E x p e c t e d g r o w t h} _ {\text {y e a r s 2 - 5}} \\ = (\$ 30 / \$ 3) / 5 = 2. 0 \\ \end{array}

$$

If this approach is used, the PEG ratio would have to be estimated uniformly for all of the other comparable firms as well, using the forward PE and the expected growth rate from years 2 through 5.

Building on the theme of uniformity, the PEG ratio should be estimated using the same growth estimates for all firms in the sample. You should not, for instance, use five-year growth rates for some firms and one-year growth rates for others. One way of ensuring uniformity is to use the same source for earnings growth estimates
