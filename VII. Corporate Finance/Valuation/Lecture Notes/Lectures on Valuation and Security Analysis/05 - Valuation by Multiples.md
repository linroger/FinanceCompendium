# Lecture Note 5 Valuation by Multiples

# Objective

Introduce students to the mechanics of valuation using comparable multiples.

# Outline
- Defining valuation multiple
- Valuing equity: P/E, P/C, P/B and P/S multiples
- Price multiples and value drivers
- Total enterprise value multiples
- Valuation by comparable transactions

# Valuation Multiple

A valuation multiple is the ratio of the market value to a consistent accounting base.

$$
M u l t i p l e = \frac {\text {M a r k e t V a l u e}}{\text {A c c o u n t i n g B a s e}} \tag {1}
$$

If the objective is to value the equity of the firm, then we can use the following ratios:

- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: This is the ratio of price per share to earnings per share.
- Price-to-Cash Flow (P/C) Ratio: This is the ratio of price per share to gross (equity) cash flows per share. Gross cash flows to equity are usually defined as net income + depreciation & amortization.
- Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio: This is the ratio of price per share to book value of equity per share. This is also referred to as the Market-to-Book Ratio (M/B).
- Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio: This is the ratio of price per share to sales per share. Do you see any inconsistency in the definition of this multiple?

# Example of Valuation by Multiples

# Firm A

2013 Earnings  $\$ 100$ MM

Nov 2014 Market value of equity

Price-to-current earnings (P/E):  $\$ 1,000/100 = 10

<table><tr><td>Comparable Firms</td><td>P/E</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Mean</td><td>12.4</td></tr><tr><td>Median</td><td>12</td></tr></table>

Value of equity of my firm based on your multiple is:

# My Value = Your P/E * My Earnings

Value based on median P/E = 12 * 100 = 1,200 MM

Value based on mean P/E = 12.4 * 100 = 1,240 MM

Firm A seems undervalued by  $200 MM to$ 240 MM based on comparable multiples valuation technique.

The actual computations are simple. The difficulty is in choosing appropriate comparables. We will focus on how to choose comparables based on value drivers.

# P/E Ratio and Value Drivers

From the Gordon growth model, the price of a stock:

$$
P _ {0} = \frac {F C F E _ {1}}{r _ {e} - g} = \frac {E _ {1} (1 - k)}{r _ {e} - g}
$$ where  $\mathrm{FCFE}_1$  is forecasted free cash flows to equity,  $\mathrm{E}_1$  is forecasted earnings or EPS, and 'k' is the plowback ratio. Thus, P/E ratio in terms of projected next period earnings:


$$

\frac {P _ {0}}{E _ {1}} = \frac {(1 - k)}{r _ {e} - g} \tag {2}

$$

Since  $\mathrm{E}_1 = \mathrm{E}_0(1 + \mathrm{g})$ ,  $\mathrm{P} / \mathrm{E}$  ratio in terms of current earnings:

$$

\frac {P _ {0}}{E _ {0}} = \frac {(1 + g) (1 - k)}{r _ {e} - g} \tag {3}

$$

Equations (2) and (3) show the value drivers that affect  $P / E$  ratios, namely, expected growth in earnings, plowback rate, and cost of equity.

Therefore, when choosing comparables for  $P / E$  based valuation, we should look for firms with similar expected growth rates, plowback rates, and operating risk/cost of equity.

# P/B and Value Drivers

Since  $\mathrm{ROE} = \mathrm{E}_1 / \mathrm{B}_0 \Rightarrow \mathrm{E}_1 = \mathrm{ROE} \times \mathrm{B}_0$ . From the Gordon growth model:

$$

P _ {0} = \frac {B _ {0} \times R O E \times (1 - k)}{r _ {e} - g}

$$

Since  $\mathbf{g} = \mathbf{k}^{*}\mathbf{R}\mathbf{O}\mathbf{E}$  in the steady state:

$$

\frac {P _ {0}}{B _ {0}} = \frac {R O E - g}{r _ {e} - g} \tag {4}

$$

Add and subtract  $r_e$  to the numerator:

$$

\frac {P _ {0}}{B _ {0}} = 1 + \frac {R O E - r _ {e}}{r _ {e} - k \times R O E} \tag {5}

$$

Equation (5) can also be derived from the discounted residual income (EVA for shareholders) model.
- P/B is strongly influenced by ROE. All else equal, a lower ROE leads to a lower P/B and a higher ROE leads to a higher P/B.
- While choosing comparable firms, look for firms with similar ROE, growth, and operating risk.

# P/S and Value Drivers

Define net profit margin as Net Income / Sales. Then:  $\mathrm{E}_0 =$  Profit Margin  $\times \mathrm{S}_0$ . From the Gordon Growth Model:

$$

P _ {0} = \frac {F C F E _ {1}}{r _ {e} - g} = \frac {E _ {1} (1 - k)}{r _ {e} - g}

$$

$$

P _ {0} = \frac {F C F E _ {1}}{r _ {e} - g} = \frac {E _ {0} (1 + g) (1 - k)}{r _ {e} - g}

$$

$$

P _ {0} = \frac {S _ {0} \times P r o f i t M a r g i n \times (1 + g) (1 - k)}{r _ {e} - g}

$$

$$

\frac {P _ {0}}{S _ {0}} = \frac {\text {P r o f i t M a r g i n} \times (1 + g) (1 - k)}{r _ {e} - g} \tag {6}

$$
- P/S ratio is increasing in profit margin. All else equal, firms with higher profit margin should have higher P/S.
- In choosing comparables based on P/S, look for firms with similar profit margins, earnings growth rates, return on equity, and operating risk.

- P/E is positively correlated with growth. Firms with high growth should have high P/E.
- Choose firms with similar expected growth rates, plowback rates, and operating risk/cost of equity.

$$
- P/S ratio is positively correlated with profit margin. Firms with high profit margin should have high P/S.
- Choose firms with similar profit margins, earnings growth rates, return on equity, and operating risk.

# How to choose firms with similar operating risks?

The following proxies for operating risk can be used:
- Industry, technology, customers.
- Firm size (market capitalization, sales, assets, and number of employees).
- Beta of the firm.
- Financial leverage. Why financial leverage?

Exercise: Value LA-Z-BOY using comparable multiples.

# Total enterprise value (operating value) multiples

Firm Value

$$

= \mathrm {E} + \mathrm {P} + \mathrm {D}

$$

Value of net operating assets

$$

= \mathrm {E} + \mathrm {P} + \mathrm {D}

$$

+ Cash & non-operating assets

Value of operating assets is called total enterprise value:

Total Enterprise Value =

$$

\begin{array}{l} (M a r k e t V a l u e o f E q u i t y + M i n o r i t y I n t e r s t \\ + \text {M a r k e t V a l u e o f P r e f e r r e d S t o c k} \\ + M a r k e t \text {V a l u e o f D e b t}) \\ - C a s h \& N o n - O p e r a t i n g A s s e t s \\ \end{array}

$$

For debt, preferred stock, minority interest and cash & non-operating assets, you may use book values. Exceptions?
- Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA): Firms with similar growth in EBIT/EBITDA, similar reinvestment rates, and similar operating risks.
- Enterprise Value-to-Invested Capital (EV/IC): Firms with similar ROIC, reinvestment rates, and operating risks.
- Enterprise Value-to-Sales (EV/S): Choose firms with similar operating profit margins in addition to matching on growth rates, operating risks, and reinvestment rates.

My Equity Value

$$

\begin{array}{l} = [ \text {Y o u r (E V / E B I T D A)} * \text {M y E B I T D A} \\ + \mathrm {M y C a s h} \& \mathrm {N o n - o p e r a t i n g a s s e t s} ] \\ - \text {M y d e b t , p r e f . s t o c k} \\ \end{array}

# Valuation Based on Comparable Transactions

This approach is widely used in pricing IPOs, mergers, and acquisitions. Suppose you want to value a potential target.
- Examine comparable transactions (acquisitions) over the last several years in the target's industry or similar industries. Make sure that the target firm and the acquired firms that were part of the prior transactions have similar business characteristics.
- Compute acquisition multiples from each transaction and the mean and median across all comparable transactions.
- Project the accounting base for the target firm. Multiply the accounting base with the mean or median transaction multiple to compute the value of equity or total enterprise value of the target firm.

# Pitfalls with this approach
- Difficult to find recent comparable transactions.
- Prior transaction prices would include the value of any projected synergies, premium for corporate control and the effects of over-bidding.

This could lead to valuations that are too high.
