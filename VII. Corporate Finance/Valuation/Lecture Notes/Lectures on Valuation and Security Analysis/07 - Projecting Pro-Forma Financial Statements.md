# Forecasting Sales

There are two key steps to forecasting future sales:

- Projecting industry sales.
- Projecting the market share of the firm within the industry.

$(1 + \text{growth in firm sales}) = (1 + \text{growth in industry sales}) * (1 + \text{growth in market share})$

Note: Growth in  $\mathrm{Y} = \left\lbrack  {\mathrm{Y}\left( \mathrm{t}\right)  - \mathrm{Y}\left( {\mathrm{t} - 1}\right) }\right\rbrack  /\mathrm{Y}\left( {\mathrm{t} - 1}\right)$

# Forecasting Industry Sales and Market Share

NaN. Evaluate the (short-run) effects of macroeconomic conditions on the industry in which your firm operates.

NaN. Project long-run industry sales based on tools such as the product life-cycle model and Porter's industry structure 5forces (Chapter 4 of the text book) model.

NaN. Evaluate your firm's strategic position in the industry and evaluate its competitive advantages vis-à-vis other firms in the industry.

# Macroeconomic conditions and industry sales

NaN. Macroeconomic forecasts help predict the short-run prospects of industries.

NaN. Sources of information about macroeconomic activity over the next 12 to 24 months: a) Index of leading economic indicators constructed by the Conference Board is an average of several economic variables considered to be leading indicators of economic activity. The index can predict economic activity 6 to 9 months ahead.

b) Consensus forecasts of economists: Many private consulting firms and universities publish surveys of the forecasts of various Wall Street economists about future GDP growth, inflation, unemployment etc. The consensus predictions of these economists is often more informative than individual forecasts.

NaN. The effect of macroeconomic conditions on industry sales can be evaluated either qualitatively or quantitatively through tools such as regression analysis.

# Using Regression to Forecast Short-Run Industry Sales Given Short-Run GDP Growth Forecasts

Using data over the last 10 to 15 years, regress annual real growth in industry sales on annual real GDP growth.

Real growth in industry sales can be measured either in terms of growth in number of units sold (say cars or computers) or by measuring growth in constant dollar sales.

Fit a simple linear regression as follows:

Real growth in industry sales  $= a + b^{*}$  Real GDP growth

Where 'a' is the intercept and 'b' is the slope.

The estimated regression equation can be used to estimate the growth in industry sales over the next two to three years, given forecasts of GDP growth.

We also need to forecast the rate of inflation or unit prices over the next two to three years to convert real industry sales forecasts to nominal industry sales forecasts.

# Projecting Long-Run Industry Sales

Long-run industry sales depend very little on macroeconomic conditions since macroeconomic conditions tend to average out in the long run (neither a protracted slump nor a long period of high prosperity).

Several tools are available to forecast long-run industry sales:

NaN. Using historical mean or median real industry sales growth; not useful for new industries.

NaN. The Product Life-Cycle Model can be used to predict the stage in the life cycle of a product (development, expansion, maturity, or decline). The product life-cycle model captures the phenomenon of mean-reversion.

NaN. Porter's Industry Structure Analysis can also be helpful in predicting long-run industry prospects; five forces affect an industry's profitability: substitute products, supplier bargaining power, customer bargaining power, entry/exit barriers; industry competitiveness.

NaN. Use the tools you learned in your strategy class to provide a strategic perspective on the industry and the firm.

# Projecting the Firm's Market Share

Changes in a firm's market share are driven by the competitive position of the firm in the industry:

- A combination of price and product attributes that cannot be easily replicated by competitors.
- Marketing strategies of firms in the industry.
- Changing consumer tastes.
- Entry/Exit Barriers.

Overall, your projections of the company's market share should be consistent with your analysis of the firm's strategy.

# Three-Stage Sales Growth Model

In predicting the firm's sales growth, we can use the three-stage growth model we discussed earlier.

- In the first stage (the high growth stage lasting say 2 years) estimate specific year-to-year growth rates in firm sales.
- In the second stage (the transition stage from years 3 to 16), the sales growth rate declines toward a long-run steady state growth beyond year 16.
- In the third stage (the steady-state beyond year 16), the firm's sales are expected to grow forever at the long-run growth rate of the economy.
- Mean-reversion is the idea underlying these models.

Keep in mind that forecasting future sales is as much an art as it is a science.

# Projecting Operating Expenses, Taxes, Working Capital, and Fixed Assets

In projecting these items, we usually rely on historical financial ratios. Broadly, the following principles are worth considering:

- Use at least 5 years of financial statement data in computing the various financial ratios.
- Look for any trends in these ratios. For instance, is the gross margin improving or declining, and if so why?
- Are the assumptions you are making consistent with the firm's projected operating strategy?
- Are historical ratios good predictors of the future, especially if you expect the operating environment of the firm to change?

# Projecting Operating Expenses

Operating expenses such as cost of goods sold (COGS), sales, general & administrative expenses (SG&A) are often computed as a percentage of sales. Thus:

Operating Expenses/Sales = (COGS + SG&A - Dep.& Amort.)/Sales

COGS and SG&A typically include Dep&Amort; hence we remove these expenses from COGS & SG&A.

Projecting Operating Working Capital

Forecast operating current assets and liabilities using the following ratios:

Operating Cash/Sales (if any) Accounts Receivables/Sales Inventory/Sales Other Operating Current Assets/Sales

Accounts Payable/Sales

Wages & Salaries Payable/Sales

Accrued Expenses Payable/Sales

Other Operating Current Liabilities/Sales

(You can modify historical ratios to reflect a better inventory management system, faster collection of receivables or favorable credit on payables.)

# Projecting Operating Fixed Assets

Net Property, Plant, and Equipment (NPPE) Gross Property, Plant, and Equipment (GPPE)

Consider ratios: NPPE/Sales Other Long-Term Assets/Sales

Depreciation expenses are projected as a percentage of this year's NPPE: Depreciation&Amortization/NPPE.

Accum. Dep & Amort(t) = Accum. Dep & Amort(t-1) + Dep & Amort(t)

$\mathrm{GPPE}(t) = \mathrm{NPPE}(t) + \text { Accumulated Dep } \& \text { Amort }(t)$

Capital expenditures are computed as follows:

Capital Expenditures(t) = [NPPE(t) - NPPE(t-1)] + Dep & Amort (t) + Change in other long-term assets

# Projecting Taxes
- Use the effective tax rate computed from historical statements.
- Income Taxes Payable (which is a current operating liability) is usually projected as a fraction of income taxes provided in the income statement. It is also projected as a fraction of sales.
- Changes in deferred income taxes can be projected as fraction of the income taxes provided in the income statement or held constant at the base year levels.

You could vary other long-term liabilities with sales.

# Financing Policy

The firm needs to finance its capital expenditures. It can do that with a combination of internal funds, external debt, and external equity.

# Target Capital Structure

Financing is based on a target book D/E ratio that corresponds to a target market D/E ratio.

- The firm uses both debt and equity (internal and external).
- If the firm has excess cash and does not want to repurchase stock (because it does not want to reduce stock below a certain level) then it can pay the excess cash out as dividends (redistributing total equity among retained earnings and stock). Thus, dividends are the plug to balance the books in this financing model.
- With excess cash, therefore, the firm's actual dividend payout is likely to exceed its target dividend payout.
- The WACC based DCF approach is appropriate here.
- More general financing schemes would include pecking order financing: internal funds, short-term debt, long-term debt, and external equity in that order. The APV approach is more fitting here.

# Distribution Policy
- Examine the current practice and if there is no reason to believe that the firm will change its dividend payout policy maintain the current policy.
- If the firm regularly repurchases stock, treat the stock repurchases also as dividend payouts.

# Other Items
- Any goodwill left on the balance sheet needs to be kept as it is. It is hard to forecast goodwill.
- Any non-operating items need to be taken into account. However, it is hard to think of non-operating items that need to forecast for a long period of time. Such items need to be treated with care and caution.
- If there is any preferred stock, remember to take into account preferred dividends.
- Keep minority interest at current levels.
- Deferred tax assets and liabilities should also be kept at current levels. Long-term liabilities may stay at current levels or vary with sales.
- The coupon rate can be decreased or increased over time based on current interest rates.

# Performance Scenarios

It may be a good idea to develop several performance scenarios for the firm and the industry. For instance (see Chapter 9 in KGW for more discussion):

- Increasing market share and high sales growth.
- Constant market share and moderate sales growth.
- Losing market share and declining sales growth.

The ratios used to forecast operating expenses; working capital, fixed assets etc. may vary depending on the performance scenario.
