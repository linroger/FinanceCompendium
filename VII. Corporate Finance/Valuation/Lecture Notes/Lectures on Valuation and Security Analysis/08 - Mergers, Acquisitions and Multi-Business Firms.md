# Lecture Note 8 Firm Valuation: Valuing Mergers, Acquisitions & Multi-Business Firms

# What are Mergers and Acquisitions?
- Mergers and acquisitions are economically no different from internal capital expenditures such as building a new plant, buying a new machine, expanding capacity, or investing in new technology.
- Capital expenditures are internal investments needed to grow a firm. Acquisitions are external investments needed to grow a firm.
- Therefore, the same DCF valuation techniques we use to value internal capital expenditures (capital budgeting) can also be used to value external investments such as acquisitions.
- Acquirer (buyer) and the Target (seller).

# Acquisitions Vs Internal Investments

Management faces the choice of growth through internal investments or growth through acquisitions. In general, acquisitions provide:

- A faster and (may be) cheaper way to enter a new market.
- Strategic assets such as brand name, proprietary technology, patents, experienced management etc. that are difficult to develop internally.

# Economic Forces Behind Mergers & Acquisitions
- While acquisitions and internal investments are comparable at the firm level they have different effects at the industry level.
- At the industry level, internal investment adds to existing capital stock, while mergers and acquisitions are mostly a reallocation of existing assets.
- What drives firms' choice to expand through acquisitions or through internal investments? The capacity utilization in the industry: specifically, excess capacity drives industry consolidation through mergers while peak capacity utilization induces industry expansion through internal corporate investments (see Andrade and Stafford, 1999).
- The excess capacity may be a result of external economic shocks such as deregulation, foreign competition, etc.
- The market for corporate control acts to consolidate the excess capacity. Poorly managed firms get taken over by new owners who restructure these firms and create additional value (control premium) through better management (Manne, 1965).
- A behavioral reason often cited for takeovers and acquisitions is managerial hubris (see Roll, 1986).

# Types of Mergers
- Horizontal Mergers and Acquisitions: These transactions involve two firms in the same line of business. United Airlines with Continental.

Vertical Mergers and Acquisitions: These transactions involve a firm acquiring a supplier or a distributor or a retailer.

- Conglomerate Mergers: These transactions involve two firms in unrelated lines of business. Such mergers were common in the 1960s and 1970s. The most commonly cited reason for conglomerate mergers is diversification.

# Mergers by Mode of Acquisition & Form of Payment
- Mode of Acquisition: (a) Mergers are generally friendly deals that enjoy the cooperation of incumbent managers, (b) Tender offers are usually hostile takeover offers made directly to target's shareholders with the active resistance of incumbent managers.
- Form of Payment: (a) Stock offer involves the use of acquirer's stock (b) Cash offer involves simple cash payment (c) there could be a mixture of stock and cash.

# Right Reasons for Mergers and Acquisitions

# 1) Achieving Operating Synergies: a) In horizontal mergers or acquisitions (involves two firms in the same industry or line of business), operating synergy gains typically arise from economies of scale, which reduce costs, increased market power, which increases sales and profit margins, or complementary resources.

b) In vertical integration (involves suppliers, distributors or retailers) synergies arise from having better control of the production and distribution chain and because the target may have skills or markets that enhances the value of the acquirer.

c) These synergies can be valued by discounting the incremental cash flows associated with synergies, i.e., reduced costs, increased sales, etc., at the WACC of the combined firm. Why the combined firm?

NaN. Achieving Financial Synergies: A company with excess cash and not enough investment opportunities may want to take over a cash-strapped firm with profitable investment opportunities. The value of these synergies represents the value of projects that would otherwise have not been taken.

NaN. Tax Synergies: A company that is paying high taxes on its income may want to acquire another firm with accumulated tax losses in order to reduce its own taxes or vice-versa. The value of these synergies represents the present value of taxes saved due to the acquisition (tax inversions).

# 4) Value from better management: a) A new group of managers may be able to increase firm value by cutting costs or by increasing sales. The value from better management is referred to as control premium.

b) The value from better management is the difference between the value under new management (restructured value) and the value under old management (un-restructured value). This value is defined as the present value of incremental cash flows (improved sales, reduced costs) associated with new management.

# Some Dubious Reasons for Mergers & Acquisitions

NaN. Diversification. Why is this dubious reason?

NaN. Increasing earnings per share or EPS Accretion.

a) EPS Vs Cash Flows.

b) Is maximizing EPS the same as maximizing value?

c) Can you provide conditions under which this may be true?

# Valuing Mergers & Acquisitions

$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}} =$  Stand-alone value of the target.

$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}} =$  Stand-alone value of the acquirer.

V = Value of the combined company.

P = Price paid for the target.

$\Delta \mathbf{V} =$  Value created by the acquisition.

$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{S}} =$  Value of operating, financial, and tax synergies from the acquisition.

$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{C}} =$  Value from better management (control premium)

Value created by the acquisition:

$$
\Delta \mathbf {V} = \mathbf {V} - \left(\mathbf {V} _ {\mathrm {A}} + \mathbf {V} _ {\mathrm {T}}\right) (\text {a s s u m e s} \mathbf {V} \neq \mathbf {V} _ {\mathrm {A}} + \mathbf {V} _ {\mathrm {T}})
$$

Maximum price for the target  $= \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}} + \Delta \mathrm{V}$

This assumes that all of the value created by the acquisition accrues to the target shareholders.

Value created for the buyer = Maximum price for the target - Purchase price

$$
= \left(\mathrm {V} _ {\mathrm {T}} + \Delta \mathrm {V}\right) - \mathrm {P}
$$

The value created by the acquisition:

$$
\Delta \mathbf {V} = \mathbf {V} _ {\mathrm {S}} + \mathbf {V} _ {\mathrm {C}}
$$

Note that  $\mathrm{V_S}$  and  $\mathrm{V_C}$  can be less than zero. Why?

# Computing the stand-alone value of the target
- Valuation based on forecasting free cash flows to firm (FCFF), computing terminal value, WACC etc.
- In computing WACC, remember the cost of capital for the target firm or division depends on the target's systematic risks. The debt-to-value ratios to be used in the WACC calculation should once again be based on the systematic risks of the target firm.
- Remember the following fundamental principle about computing cost of capital: it is not who raises money that determines the cost of capital, it is what the money is raised for. Money raised to finance more risky (systematically) investments would be more costly than money raised to finance less risky investments.
- Thus, the actual cost at which the acquirer raises funds to finance the acquisition has little relevance to determining the cost of capital for the acquisition (the target).

# Stand-alone value of the acquirer

Value based on acquirer's cash flows and cost of capital.

# Valuing Synergies and Better Management

We discussed the valuation of synergies and control premium on pages 5 and 6.

# Market Reaction to Merger Announcements

Short-Term Market Reaction

Immediately after the announcement of an acquisition, the market value of the target firm (controlling for market movements) goes up by  $20\%$  to  $35\%$  (see papers by Jensen and Ruback (1983), Bradley, Desai, and Kim (1983), Jarrell, Brickley, and Netter (1988), Franks, Harris, and Titman (1991)).

The same studies indicate that after the announcement of a merger/acquisition, on average, the market value of the acquiring firm (after controlling for market movements) either drops by about  $3\%$  in the case of stock offers or goes up marginally in the case of cash offers.

The evidence suggests that:

- Initially, all the gains from a merger or acquisition accrue to the target shareholders (the sellers) and the buyers get next to nothing.
- Why? Probably because of the bidding that usually accompanies most merger transactions and the resulting winner's curse.

# Long-Run Market Reaction
- What happens to the stock price of acquiring companies in the long-run? Loughran and Vijh (1997), Journal of Finance, study this question using 947 mergers and acquisitions from 1970 to 1989.
- They compute buy-and-hold abnormal returns (compared to matching firms) earned by the acquiring firms for a five-year period after the acquisition date. They find that firms that complete stock mergers earn significantly negative abnormal returns of  $-25\%$  over the next five years while firms that complete cash tender offers earn significantly positive abnormal returns of  $61.7\%$  over the next five years.
- Mitchell and Stafford (2000) also find that acquirers that use stock financing underperform comparable firms by about  $8\%$  during the next three years.
- Fuller, Netter, and Stegemoller (2002) and Moeller, Schlingemann, and Stulz (2005) also report similar loss of value for long-term shareholders of the merged firms.
- Why? An adverse selection argument (see Myers and Majluf (1984)) would say that acquirers issue stock only when the stock is overvalued. Acquirers are likely to use cash when their stock is undervalued.
- Moral: If you are a long-term target shareholder, beware of acquirers bearing stock offers.

# Empirical evidence on the existence of synergies

The empirical evidence on the ex-post performance does not provide much support for the existence of synergies, on average.

- A McKinsey study examined 116 acquisition programs in U.S. and U.K. from 1972 to 1983. The study limited itself to Fortune 200 largest U.S. industrials or the Financial Times top 150 U.K. industrials. An acquisition program is judged to be successful if the acquisitions created positive EVA over the next 3 to 5 years. The study found that  $61\%$  of the programs ended in failure and only  $23\%$  in success. The study also found that the acquisitions that succeeded involved acquirers with strong core businesses prior to the acquisition.
- Other studies (see Mitchell and Lehn (1990)) indicate that more than  $20\%$  of the acquisitions get divested within 3 years and about  $50\%$  by 10 years.
- Devos, Kadapakkam, and Krishnamurthy (2009) study 264 large mergers from 1980 to 2004 and estimate average synergy gains to be  $10\%$  of the combined equity value of the merging firms. Operating synergies accounted for most of the synergy gains and were higher for focused mergers and undervalued acquirers. The operating synergies arise from cutting back on capital expenditures and investments in working capital and not from revenue increases or cost savings.

# Possible Reasons for Failure of acquisitions
- Overestimation of synergies.
- Overbidding in multiple bidder situations. E.g.: RJR-Nabisco and Winner's curse.
- Poor post-acquisition integration.

# Leveraged Buy-outs

A leverage buy-out (LBO) differs from ordinary acquisitions in the following ways: a) It is heavily debt financed (often  $80\%$  to  $90\%$  debt most of which tends to well below investment grade, junk bonds). The debt funds are often borrowed against the physical assets of the acquired business.

b) The ownership transfers to a small group of private (institutional) investors, which is often led by the management of the pre-LBO firm. After the LBO transaction, the shares of the firm no longer trade on the open market.

c) The buyers are, thus, not a traditional corporation as in other acquisitions, but a newly formed non-operating company capitalized by their (often tiny) equity investments and the borrowed funds. The entire resources of the new corporation are then used to pay the purchase price.

d) One of the motives stated for LBO transactions is reducing the agency costs of free cash flows. The idea is that the high level of debt would discipline managers and force them to be more efficient.

# LBO Target Characteristics

1. Cash cows: Companies with low to moderate sale growth, with large and stable free cash flows.
2. Mature industry: Companies in high technology industries where rapid product obsolescence takes place are not preferred. Similarly, companies in highly cyclical industries are not preferred.
3. **Strong balance sheets:** The acquirers look for firms with strong balance sheets and tangible assets and no contingent liabilities. The capacity to raise large amounts of debt financing depends on this factor. Along these lines, acquirers prefer firms with little or no long-term debt, which indicates unutilized debt capacity.
4. Quality Management: A quality management team is necessary for cutting costs, reducing unnecessary capital expenditures and achieving efficiency. The management must be capable of dealing with the pressure from the debt servicing requirements associated with a large debt.

# Do LBO transactions create ex-post value?

Kaplan (1989) studied 48 LBOs involving management buy-out that took place between 1980-86. He finds that there were dramatic improvements in sales, profits, and cash flows in the three years after the LBO.

Anslinger and Copeland (1996, HBR) find leveraged buyout firms earn returns greater than their cost of capital in their acquisitions.

# Valuation of Multi-Business Firms
- Individual business units are defined as separable entities that have no significant synergies with other parts of the company. They could be spun-off as stand-alone businesses.
- Estimate free cash flows from operations (FCFF) for each business unit.
- Compute WACC for each business unit using the divisional cost of capital approach based on pure-play firms.
- Value each business unit using the DCF approach (you can also use the multiples approach to get relative value).
- Consider the costs and benefits involving corporate headquarters. This requires a great deal of judgment.
- The operating value of the firm (total enterprise value) is the sum of the values of the individual business unit plus the value (or minus the cost) associated with headquarters.
- Add the value of excess cash to the operating value to get the total firm value.
