# Lecture Note 9 Security Analysis and Investor Behavior

# >> Factors that complement valuation

We need valuation models because markets are not always efficient.

$\triangleright$  Valuation, however, is only the beginning of security analysis.

A comprehensive approach to security analysis requires knowledge of additional firm-specific factors that complement valuation:

- Has the sentiment or momentum changed?
- What is the quality of earnings?
- What is the quality of a stock?
- Is the firm raising new capital or returning capital?
- Is the firm growing its assets rapidly? Does the firm need external capital?

Why do these things matter if we already know a firm's valuation? Because, all valuation models are noisy.

- Blind Men and an Elephant

# >>> Some questions on security analysis

Why are markets inefficient?

- Because investors are not "rational" in the sense of classical economics: (a) they are not intuitive statisticians and (b) they are not expected utility maximizers.

Even if markets are inefficient, how do we know any of the stock-selection strategies (value, momentum, earnings quality, fundamental analysis, asset growth, or financing activity) work?

We will explore these questions for the rest of the course.

We will examine large sample evidence on the success or failure of the various stock selection strategies.

We will discuss how to integrate these various individual strategies into a simple stock screening/selection model.

# >> Efficient Markets vs. Behavioral Finance

Behavioral finance is an alternative to efficient markets. It tries to explain market inefficiencies using "models in which some agents are not fully rational." See Barberis and Thaler (2003).

It owes its existence to the path-breaking work of several psychologists including Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.

- Kahneman won the 2002 Nobel prize in economics even though he is not an economist.

Fischer Black (1986) refers to agents who are not fully rational as noise traders.

- Noise traders believe they are trading on information although they are trading on noise.

> Security analysis and active money management is an attempt to arbitrage the mispricing caused by noise traders.
We will explore the common behavioral biases that individuals exhibit and how we might guard against them.

# >> Investor Behavior

"The investor's chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is likely to be himself."

- Benjamin Graham

Considered the father of value investing

"Investing is simple, but not easy."

"Success in investing doesn't correlate with IQ once you are above the level of 100….what you need is the temperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble in investing."

- Warren Buffett

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/589a7289-be2c-43df-a71a-97ca24b50ab2/df44a934a094b05ca013193297eb83f5c00de9677b61e207be92182d7355939a.jpg)

# >> Psychology of Investing Success

Good investing is about making good predictions.

$\triangleright$  Making good predictions is about understanding probability and statistics.

People are good intuitive grammarians.

Are they good intuitive statisticians?

Are they good at estimating probabilities?

# >> Heuristics and Cognitive Biases

Heuristic: A simple procedure that helps find adequate, though often imperfect answers to difficult questions;

- A short-cut or rule of thumb.

Examples: Educated guess, Common sense, Gut feel

- People use heuristics when estimating probabilities.
- These heuristics can give rise to systematic biases in our judgments and decision-making.

# >> Dr. McCoy and Spock

Psychologists* refer to two different systems embedded in our minds to explain the way our brains work.

- System 1: is the Dr. McCoy (M) System which is emotional, intuitive, reflexive, effortless and fast.
- System 2: is the Spock (S) System which is rational, logical, and analytical, but also slow and lazy.

The M system can give rise to cognitive biases. The S system attempts to monitor and control the M system, but is not always successful.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/589a7289-be2c-43df-a71a-97ca24b50ab2/7cdf68818e64f4aa702d3912c1b003cac17b421c8320b3dd3f07838d9b1a025a.jpg)

# >> How Do They Work?

What is  $95 \times 78$ ?

$\triangleright$  Recognizing the sad face and the smiley face is automatic, which is the work of the M system.

This is not automatic. McCoy is useless here. This requires Spock.

# >> Division of Labor

There is a division of labor between the two systems.

M System:

- Our brain's go-to system for routine decisions and is always on.
- Takes over in emergencies, reacts automatically to dangers and challenges, deals with familiar situations, and makes accurate short-term predictions.
- It sometimes answers easier questions than the one it was asked, is impulsive and intuitive, and doesn't understand logic and statistics.

S System:

- Continuously monitors the M system and tries to keep it out of trouble.
- It is called to action only when the M system runs into difficulty  $(95 \times 78)$ .
- Only one that can follow rules, make deliberate choices, exercise executive control, etc., but it has limited resources.

From Neuroscience: Parts of the brain associated with the M system are evolutionarily older than those of the S system.

# >> Are We Dr. McCoy or Spock?

Shane Frederick (2005) has designed a Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) consisting of 3 questions that is a simple measure of the susceptibility to the M system.

- The score is 3 for getting all questions correct and 0 for getting none of them correct.
- A low score indicates greater influence by the emotional M system and a high score indicates lesser influence.
- The test was administered to various groups (see the next page) and  $1 / 3^{rd}$  of the participants got none of the answers right! Only  $17\%$  got all right.

This suggests that all of us are prone to decisions under the M system; unchecked by the more logical S system.

# >> The CRT Test

Answer the following questions in 90 seconds or 30 seconds per question (no cheating!)

(Answers provided on the last page.)

# Figure 1

# The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)

(1) A bat and a ball cost  $1.10 in total. The bat costs$ 1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? _____ cents

(2) If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets? ______ minutes

(3) In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake? ______ days

# >> Limited Resources of S System

$\triangleright$  Self control and deliberate thought draw on the same limited resources:

- It is hard to multiply 95 times 78 in your head, talk on the cell phone, and run uphill all at the same time!
- Self control is tiring and leads to ego depletion making subsequent cognitive tasks harder to complete.
- Weight loss requires two simultaneously difficult tasks: exercise and controlling what we eat. This is tiring for the S system.

# >> When Are We Likely to Rely on the M System?

$\triangleright$  According to Psychologists M system is influential:

- When the S system is cognitively busy or impaired
" People's behavior after a few drinks, a sleepless night, or a long, stressful meeting.
- When the problem is ill-structured and complex.
- When information is incomplete, ambiguous, and changing.
- When goals are ill-defined, shifting, or competing.
- When stress is high due to time constraints or high stakes.
- When decisions depend on interacting with other people.

All of this more or less applies to investment decisions!

Quantitative investment strategies attempt to minimize the influence of the M system and enhance the role of the S system.

# >> Various Behavioral Biases

Optimism bias

Overconfidence and illusion of confidence

Availability bias and Hindsight bias

The law of small numbers

$\triangleright$  Anchoring

$\triangleright$  Base Rate Neglect and Representativeness

$\triangleright$  Regression to the mean

Affect Heuristic, Halo effect, Confirmation bias, and Familiarity bias

Prospect Theory, Loss Aversion, and Framing

$\triangleright$  Mental accounting and Sunk cost fallacy

Intuitions vs. Formulas

# >> Optimism Bias

$\triangleright$  Consider these questions:

- What is a new restaurant owner's estimate of chance of success?
- What is an entrepreneur's estimate of chance of success?
- What is a CEO's estimate of value gain to his shareholders from a recent acquisition?

$>60\%$  of new restaurants are out of business in 3 years. The chances that a small business will survive for 5 years in the U.S. are about  $35\%$ .

Optimistic CEOs take on too much debt, overpay for targets, and engage in value-destroying mergers (Roll, 1986: "Hubris Hypothesis"; Malmendier and Tate, 2008).

$\triangleright$  Lench and Ditto (2008): People believe more positive than negative life events will occur to them.

# >> Optimism Bias

$\triangleright$  Optimism likely has an evolutionary advantage and psychologists have shown that it is largely inherited.

> Optimists are the inventors, the entrepreneurs, and successful political and military leaders. They are cheerful, resilient, healthier, and live longer. They are necessary for the economic development of a society. The key though is to be optimistic without losing track of reality.
While optimism may be good for the society and a good life strategy, it is not necessarily a good investment strategy.

- Forecasts of Dow 36,000 in 1999 during the dot-com bubble.
- Over-optimism during the 2001-2006 Housing Bubble.

Be skeptical in evaluating optimistic earnings forecasts and investment recommendations.

$\triangleright$  Engage in premortem to overcome groupthink and optimism.

# >> Overconfidence

Lake Wobegon where "all the women are strong, all the men are good looking, and all the children are above average"

- Garrison Keillor

A Prairie Home Companion

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/589a7289-be2c-43df-a71a-97ca24b50ab2/637dd2bb0cd97be7fb4c503075196b2878c309ca85734215336471fe85eff7e8.jpg)

Overconfidence leads people to overestimate their abilities and forecasting skills.

It leads to confidence intervals that are too narrow and judgments that are too certain, which can give rise to extreme actions and excessive trading.

# >> Overconfidence

" Doctors vs. Weathermen (Montier, 2010):

- Doctors think they are right  $90 \%$ of the time on their diagnoses based on case notes but are correct only  $15 \%$ of the time!
- Weathermen think they are right  $50 \%$ of the time on their predictions from weather patterns and they are right  $50 \%$ of the time. Why the difference?

In a survey, CFOs predicted 1-year S&P 500 returns and a 10 percentile low estimate and a 90 percentile high estimate.

- 11,600 forecasts collected from March 2001 to February 2010 (Ben-David, Graham, and Harvey, 2013). Zero correlation between CFO forecasts and realized returns.
- Their confidence intervals are too narrow indicating overconfidence in their forecasting skill!

<table><tr><td colspan="4">S&amp;P 500 Realizations falling in various intervals</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>\% below 10th percentile</td><td>\% between 10th and 90th percentile</td><td>\% above 90th percentile</td></tr><tr><td>All Forecasts</td><td>35.6</td><td>32.8</td><td>31.6</td></tr></table>

# >> Evidence on Overconfidence

Overconfidence is universal*:

- $63 \%$ of Americans consider themselves to be above average in intelligence.  $71 \%$ of Men and  $57 \%$ of Women consider themselves above average!
- $70 \%$ of Canadians think they have above average intelligence.
- $69 \%$ of Swedish college students estimate they are above average drivers.
- $75 \%$ of U.S. chess players believed they were underrated relative to U.S. chess federation ratings.
- $66 \%$ of students at Cornell who took a senseofhumor test thought they had an aboveaverage sense of humor.

$\triangleright$  Self-attribution bias: Success is due to our ability and failure is due to external circumstances.

- Makes people more overconfident over time.

# >> Skill and Confidence

The least skilled tend to be the most overconfident:

- Chess players who were in the bottom half of the rating scale are the ones who considered themselves the most under-rated.
- Students who scored in the lowest  $25 \%$ of a senseofhumor test thought they had an aboveaverage sense of humor.
- The incompetent face two hurdles. One, they are below average in ability. Two, they are unaware they are below average.
- There is evidence that improving the skills of the incompetent reduces their overconfidence.

People who are highly competent suffer from underconfidence:

- Students in the top  $25 \%$ of the humor test underestimated the number of their peers who were less funny.
Confidence is not an indicator of ability although people often mistake confidence for ability. Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons (2010) refer to this as the Illusion of Confidence.

# >> Overconfidence Among Investors

> Barber and Odean (2000) examine data from a large discount brokerage firm over 1991 to 1996 and find:

- Investors who trade the most earn the lowest annual returns (11\%) net of transaction costs compared to those who trade the least (19\%).
- Investors who switch to online trading, trade more actively, speculatively, and less profitably than before (Barber and Odean, 2002); Online trading reduces their returns from  $2\%$  above the market before to  $3\%$  below the market after.
- Men trade  $45 \%$ more actively than women and underperformed women by about  $1 \%$ a year (Barber and Odean, 2001).
- Overconfidence is the possible culprit.

Individual investors should be aware of overconfidence in their forecasting skills (for prices and fundamentals) and excessive trading that might result from it.

# >> Availability Heuristic and Hindsight Bias

Availability Heuristic: Judging frequencies and probabilities by the "ease with which examples come to mind." It is heavily influenced by media coverage.

- Death by accidents was judged 300 times more likely than death by diabetes, but the true ratio is 1:4.
- Disaster insurance purchases shoot up after a disaster.
- Investors' estimates of the probability of a crash probably increased in 2009 after observing the crash of 2008/09 even though crashes are rare.

Hindsight bias: "I knew it all along"

- The tendency to revise the history of one's beliefs in light of what actually happened; Common among stock market pundits.
- The worse the consequence, the greater the hindsight bias (second-guessing)
- Assess the quality of a decision by the process, not by the outcome.

# >> The Law of Small Numbers

Which one of these earnings sequences appear predictable and how would you characterize the performance of these firms?

Annual Earnings Patterns

<table><tr><td></td><td>Firm A</td><td>Firm B</td><td>Firm C</td></tr><tr><td>Year 1</td><td>Decrease</td><td>Increase</td><td>Decrease</td></tr><tr><td>Year 2</td><td>Increase</td><td>Increase</td><td>Increase</td></tr><tr><td>Year 3</td><td>Decrease</td><td>Increase</td><td>Increase</td></tr><tr><td>Year 4</td><td>Decrease</td><td>Increase</td><td>Decrease</td></tr><tr><td>Year 5</td><td>Decrease</td><td>Increase</td><td>Decrease</td></tr></table>

The law of large numbers says that the average of results obtained from a large sample of data should be close to the population average, e.g., the average height of U.S. men.

People, however, behave as if the "law of large numbers" should apply to small samples as well. This behavioral bias is referred to "tongue-in-cheek" as the law of small numbers.

In small samples, random processes produce many sequences that appear to people to be not random at all – Illusion of Pattern.

Studies show that there is no hot hand in basketball. It is an example of our desire to seek pattern and causality in randomness.

# >> Anchoring

Visitors to the San Francisco Exploratorium were asked one of the following sets of questions:

- Set 1: (1) Is the height of the tallest redwood tree more or less than 1,200 feet? (2) What is the height of the tallest redwood?
- Set 2: (1) Is the height of the tallest redwood tree more or less than 180 feet? (2) What is the height of the tallest redwood?

The first group estimated 844 feet on average and the second estimated 282 feet.

This is anchoring. People anchor to the value in the question when estimating an unknown quantity. Anchors that are random can be as effective as potentially informative anchors.

- Anchoring Index:  $(844 - 282) / (1,200 - 180) = 55\%$ . This value is typical.

In negotiations, the party that is the first mover can use anchors to its advantage. If you are the counter-party, focus attention on arguments against the anchor.

# >> Base Rate Neglect and Representativeness

# Consider this question:

"Tom is a graduate student at your state university. Please rank the following nine fields of graduate studies in order of the likelihood that Tom is now a student in each of these fields (1 is most likely, 9 is least likely): business administration, computer science, engineering, humanities and education, law, medicine, library science, physical and life sciences, social science and social work."

- The answer depends on the proportion of graduate students enrolled in the different fields, statistics that should be readily available from the university.
- The proportion of students in a field is referred to as the base rate. Since more students typically enroll in humanities and education than in computer science, it is more likely that Tom is a humanities student than a computer science student.

# >> Base Rate Neglect and Representativeness

The following is a personality sketch of Tom written during Tom's senior year in high school by a psychologist, on the basis of psychological tests of uncertain validity:

"Tom is of high intelligence, although lacking in true creativity. He has a need for order and clarity, and for neat and tidy systems in which every detail finds its appropriate place. His writing is rather dull and mechanical, occasionally enlivened by somewhat corny puns and flashes of imagination of sci-fi type. He has a strong drive for competence. He seems to have little feeling and little sympathy for other people, and does not enjoy interacting with others. Self-centered, he nonetheless has a deep moral sense."

Now, please rank the following nine fields of specialization (same as on the previous page) in order of the likelihood that Tom is now a graduate student in each of these fields.

Which field do you think most people pick as the most likely now for Tom?

# >> Base Rate Neglect and Representativeness

Most people pick Computer Science, ignoring base rates. This is base rate neglect. The choice of computer science is based on the representativeness heuristic.

$\triangleright$  Representativeness is the act of judging probabilities by similarity of the description to stereotypes, ignoring both the base rates and the doubts about the accuracy of the description.

Since Tom's description sounds similar to that of a nerd, people wrongly conclude that he is likely a computer science student. What is needed to reach this conclusion is evidence that he had high grades in Math/Computer science. The description is not informative.

The M system substitutes a question about similarity in place of the question about probability because the question about similarity is easier to answer than the question about probability.

The correct way to evaluate the probability that Tom is a graduate student in any of those fields is to use Bayes' Theorem, named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, an eighteenth century English mathematician and Presbyterian minister.

# >> Regression to the Mean*

# Sports Illustrated Jinx:
- Nov 20, 2013: Alabama QB featured on the SI cover
- Nov 30, 2013: Alabama loses to Auburn

No jinx! Regression to the mean and bad luck.

Period 1 growth:

- Firm 1: Above average growth = Above average performance + Above average luck
- Firm 2: Below Average growth = Below average performance + Below Average luck

Period 2 growth

- Firm 1: Above average performance + Average luck
- Firm 2: Below average performance + Average luck

Extreme past performance tends to moderate.

$\triangleright$  Ignoring this can give rise to the extrapolation bias. Be aware of this in evaluating the past performance of firms, money managers, etc.

*Sir Francis Galton (1886)

Medicurity in Hereditary

Stature"

# >>Affect Heuristic and Halo Effect

Affect Heuristic*: People let their likes and dislikes and emotions determine their beliefs about the world, and rely on them to make judgments and decisions, regardless of objective evidence.

- Attitudes about environment, nuclear power, red meat, guns, cars, etc.
- If you like a CEO, you underestimate the risks of owning the stock and overestimate the benefits of owning the stock regardless of what the data says.
- Here the S system acts in concert with the M system searching for information to reinforce existing beliefs.

$\triangleright$  Halo effect: The tendency to like everything about a person, including things unobserved, is known as the halo effect.

- Halo effect gives too much weight to first impressions, often ignoring subsequent (perhaps contradictory) information.
- This is the way the M system simplifies the complex task of evaluating someone's abilities.

# >> Confirmation Bias and Familiarity Bias

Confirmation bias: We test our beliefs and hypotheses by searching for confirming evidence, contrary to the recommended practice which is to test hypotheses by trying to refute them.

- The confirmatory bias of the M system favors uncritical acceptance of ideas and suggestions.
- If you have an investment thesis, try looking for evidence that will refute your thesis: Talk to colleagues who are likely to question your thesis.

$\triangleright$  Familiarity bias: Things that appear familiar also appear to be true, e.g., a statement or an answer that sounds familiar.

- Repetition makes it easy for people to believe in falsehoods because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. Psychologists refer to this as the Illusion of Truth.
- The impression of familiarity is produced by the M system and the S system relies on it for a true/false judgment.

# >> Rationality in Economics

The expected utility theory in economics makes two assumptions:

- People's utility or "happiness" increases with their wealth (prefer more to less).
- People are risk averse and they demand a risk premium for taking risk. This implies people's happiness increases at a decreasing rate (an extra million is worth more to us than to Bill Gates).

Are people with equal wealth equally happy?

- Kahneman and Tversky (1979)

# >> Prospect Theory and Loss Aversion

Today Jack and Jill have a wealth of 5 million.

– Yesterday, Jack had $1 million and Jill had $9 million.

- Are they equally Happy?

Consider these two problems:

- Problem 1: Which do you choose?
" Get 900 for sure or 90 \%chance to get \$ 1,000.
- Problem 2: Which do you choose?
" Lose 900 for sure or 90 \%chance to lose \$ 1,000?

Two conclusions:

- Happiness people experience is determined by recent change in wealth not just the current level of wealth (because Jack and Jill have different reference points). Expected utility theory lacks a reference point.
- People are loss averse because the sure loss in Problem 2 is aversive. People dislike losing more than they like winning.

# >> Loss Averse Utility Function

The curve is S-shaped.

People are risk averse over gains and risk-seeking over losses.

The response to losses is stronger than the response to gains.

- A  $100 loss brings more pain than the a$ 100 gain brings pleasure.
- This is loss aversion.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-05/589a7289-be2c-43df-a71a-97ca24b50ab2/983561900ea9e8196768cc7aea55896e534e5cd3d35ec41d322ad7f623aeedca.jpg)

# >> Disposition Effect: Evidence of Loss Aversion

People sell winners too early and hold on to losers too long.

- In the housing market, when prices are falling, sellers set their asking prices too high, close to their original purchase price.
- Brokerage customers in the U.S. exhibit disposition effect (Odean, 1998).
- Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001) find disposition effect in the Finnish stock market.

This is consistent with loss aversion:

- You don't want to sell the asset and turn a paper loss into a sure loss. You hold on to the asset and the risk, hoping either the loss will be smaller or it might turn into a gain.

This is inconsistent with rational behavior:

- Tax considerations would predict: sell losers and hold on to winners.
- This is not information-based trading: Stocks that individuals sell perform better than those they do not.

# >> Framing

Loss aversion suggests that decision making is sensitive to the way alternatives are framed.

- Harvard Medical School study on the surgical treatment of lung cancer:
" Half the physician participants received statistics about survival rates: "The one-month survival rate is  $90\%$ ." The other half received statistics about mortality rates: "There is a  $10\%$  mortality rate in the first month."
" Guess which group chose surgery more?  $84 \%$  in the first group and only  $50 \%$  in the second group. The M system reacts differently to emotional words and the implied gains and losses: Survival is good, Mortality is bad,.

– Case 1: Given 10,000, choose either

" (A) a sure gain of  $5,000 or (B) a 50\% chance of winning$ 10,000?

- Case 2: Given 20,000, choose either
" (C) a sure loss of  $5,000 or (D) a 50\% chance of losing$ 10,000?

Estate Tax vs. Death Tax: Which is more unpopular?

Watch out for framing effects when presented with choices.

# >> Mental Accounting and Sunk Cost Fallacy

Consider the following pair of problems:

A woman has bought two 80 tickets to the theater. When she arrives at the theater, she opens her wallet and discovers that the tickets are missing. Will she buy two more tickets to the play?

A woman goes to the theater, intending to buy two tickets that cost $80 each. She arrives at the theater, opens her wallet, and discovers to her dismay that the $160 with which she was going to make the purchase is missing. She could use her credit card. Will she buy the tickets?

- People who see only the first story believe that the woman will go home without seeing the show. Those who see only the second story believe that she will charge tickets for the show. Why the differential response?
- Because of mental accounting and sunk cost fallacy.

" Tickets to the play belong to the play account, loss of cash belongs to the general revenue account.

In the first case, there is a sunk cost fallacy. The loss of tickets is sunk. The question now is what should she do going forward?

# >>> Intuition vs. Formulas

Psychologist Paul Meehl (1954) concluded Statistical predictions (S system) were more accurate than the subjective clinical predictions of trained professionals (M system).

- Meehl reviewed 20 studies involving prediction of academic success of freshmen, psychiatric prognosis, criminal recidivism, success of naval trainees, parole outcomes etc.

Subsequent studies have shown that algorithms match or exceed the accuracy of experts in environments involving a significant degree of uncertainty:

Investors overconfident in their ability to predict the future based on the past.

As of 2009, in the active U.S. Large Cap value space, quant managers managed only about  $8 \%$ of the roughly 800 billion in total assets under management (AUM).

Although, from 2000 to 2009, quant value managers outperformed fundamental value managers on a risk-adjusted basis (Lakonishok and Swaminathan, 2010).

# >> Conclusions and Takeaways

Be skeptical of over-optimistic forecasts and recommendations.

Be skeptical of your own forecasting skill, overconfidence lurks.

Beware of the recommendations of stock market experts. They suffer from extreme overconfidence and hindsight bias.

Beware of the anchoring effects when you are a buyer.

Beware of the extrapolation bias and be mindful of regression to the mean when evaluating past performance.

If you are an individual investor:

- Beware of excessive trading in the short-term and focus on the long-term.
- Winnie-the-Pooh: "Don't underestimate the value of doing nothing."
- Don't invest in strategies or assets that you don't understand.
- Focus on Valuation; Prepare, Pre-Commit, and Wait (standing orders to buy).
- Switch off the noise (Cable shows etc.) and keep a real-time investment diary to learn from mistakes.

When making decisions or evaluating alternatives, beware of the confirmatory bias. Look for the "outside" view.

$\triangleright$  Engage in a pre-mortem to overcome overconfident over-optimism.

$\triangleright$  Simple algorithms/formulas/check lists can often trump expert intuition.

Quantitative or rule-based investment strategies might represent a way to avoid these psychological traps.
