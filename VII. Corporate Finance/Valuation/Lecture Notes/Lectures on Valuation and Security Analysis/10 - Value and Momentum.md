# Lecture Note 10 Value and Momentum

# Market efficiency hypothesis

Stock price equals intrinsic or fundamental value:

$$
\mathrm {P} = \mathrm {V} \tag {1}
$$

Price reflects all available information about a firm.

# Weak form market efficiency

Weak form efficiency says that current price contains all of the information in past prices.

# Semi-strong form market efficiency

Semi-strong form efficiency says that current prices contain all public information.

When we refer to efficient markets, we refer to this notion.

# Strong form market efficiency

Semi-strong form efficiency says that current prices contain all information both public and private.

# Evidence on violations of weak-form efficiency

Reversals at Short Horizons (1 month and 1 week).

Buy Losers, Sell Winners – Contrarian strategy

Momentum strategies at Intermediate Horizons (3 to 12 months).

> Buy Winners, Sell Losers - Momentum strategy.

Reversals at Long Horizons (3 to 5 years).

> Buy Losers, Sell Winners – Contrarian strategy.

# Evidence on violations of semi-strong form efficiency
- Value strategies
- Strategies involving any publicly available information:
- Earnings surprises, analyst forecasts, accounting information, etc.

Glamour Stocks

Early stage winner are Value Winners.

Late stage winners are Glamour/Growth Winners.

Early stage losers are Glamour/Growth Losers.

Late stage losers are Value Losers.

# Value Strategies

> Value strategies have been popular at least since Graham and Dodd (1934) and possibly longer.
The idea is that smart investors can determine the intrinsic value of a firm through a full financial analysis of the firm and buy stocks whose intrinsic value is above the stock price  $(\mathrm{V} > \mathrm{P}$  or  $\mathrm{V} / \mathrm{P} > 1)$  and short stocks whose intrinsic value is below the stock price  $(\mathrm{V} < \mathrm{P}$  or  $\mathrm{V} / \mathrm{P} < 1)$ .
> Stocks with high earnings-to-price ratio (E/P), book equity-to-market equity ratio (B/M), cash flows-to-price ratio (C/P), sales-to-price (S/P) and dividend yield (D/P) are considered undervalued stocks. They are referred to as value stocks.

$\circ$  Earnings is last year's Net Income Before Extraordinary Items and Cash flows = Earnings + Depreciation & Amortization.

Earnings can also be FY1 and FY2 or the 12-month forecast.

$>$  Stocks with low E/P, B/M, C/P, S/P, and D/P are considered overvalued. They are referred to as growth or glamour stocks.

$\succ$  Earnings, Book, Cash flows, Sales or Dividends are rough proxies of the intrinsic value and are compared to the market price. We have already discussed estimating V using DCF models and comparable multiples.

> How does a strategy of buying value stocks and selling glamour stocks perform?

# Do value strategies work?

Under the efficient markets paradigm, value stocks should not earn higher returns than glamour stocks (unless value stocks are systematically riskier).

Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny (1994) empirically test value strategies among U.S. stocks.

- Sort the universe of U.S stocks each year based on their valuation ratios (B/M, E/P, and C/P). Divide the universe into 10 equal-weighted portfolios and then compute the returns on each portfolio over the next 1 to 5 years. Repeat this process in April of each year between 1968 and 1989.
- The  $10\%$  of the stocks with the highest valuation ratios (B/M, E/P, or C/P) are the most undervalued (value) stocks and the  $10\%$  with the lowest ratios are the most overvalued (glamour or growth) stocks.
See Table I from LSV (1994) on the next page.

# Table I Returns for Decile Portfolios Based on One-Dimensional Classifications by Various Measures of Value

At the end of each April between 1968 and 1989, 10-decile portfolios are formed in ascending order based on  $B / M$ ,  $C / P$ ,  $E / P$ , and  $GS$ .  $B / M$  is the ratio of book value of equity to market value of equity;  $C / P$  is the ratio of cash flow to market value of equity;  $E / P$  is the ratio of earnings to market value of equity, and  $GS$  refers to preformation 5-year average growth rate of sales. The returns presented in the table are averages over all formation periods.  $R_{t}$  is the average return in year  $t$  after formation,  $t = 1, \dots, 5$ .  $AR$  is the average annual return over 5 postformation years.  $CR_{5}$  is the compounded 5-year return assuming annual rebalancing.  $SAAR$  is the average annual size-adjusted return computed over 5 postformation years. The glamour portfolio refers to the decile portfolio containing stocks ranking lowest on  $B / M$ ,  $C / P$ , or  $E / P$ , or highest on  $GS$ . The value portfolio refers to the decile portfolio containing stocks ranking highest on  $B / M$ ,  $C / P$ , or  $E / P$ , or lowest on  $GS$ .

# Summary of key findings
- Value stocks outperform glamour stocks each year over the next five years. The results become stronger in Years 2 to 5.
- Value strategies are long-term strategies with low portfolio turnover. Investors need to be patient to earn abnormal returns with value strategies.
- Violation of semi-strong form market efficiency.

# Why do value strategies outperform?
- LSV argue it is because of the extrapolation bias. Investors extrapolate past performance too far into the future for both value stocks and glamour stocks. See Table V of the paper.
- Value stocks have lower growth rates in earnings, sales, and cash flows compared to glamour stocks.
- Investors mistakenly believe glamour stocks will continue to grow at a faster rate for a very long time while they assume that value stocks will grow at a slower rate also for a long time. They ignore regression to mean and extrapolate the past too far into the future. They overreact to past performance.
- Investors are too optimistic about glamour (growth) stocks and too pessimistic about value stocks. As a result glamour stocks become overvalued and value stocks become undervalued.

# Table V

# Fundamental Variables, Past Performance, and Future Performance of Glamour and Value Stocks

Panel 1: At the end of each April between 1968 and 1989, 10-decile portfolios are formed based on the ratio of end-of-previous-year's book value of equity to end-of-April market value of equity. Numbers are presented for the first (lowest  $B / M$ ) and tenth (highest  $B / M$ ) deciles. These portfolios are denoted Glamour and Value, respectively.

Panel 2: At the end of each April between 1968 and 1989, 9 groups of stocks are formed. The stocks are independently sorted in ascending order into 3 groups ((1) bottom 30 percent, (2) middle 40 percent, (3) top 30 percent) based on  $C / P$ , the ratio of cash flow to market value of equity, and  $GS$ , the preformation 5-year weighted average sales growth rank. Numbers are presented for  $(C / P_1, GS_3)$ , the bottom 30 percent by  $C / P$  and the top 30 percent by  $GS$ , and for  $(C / P_3, GS_1)$  the top 30 percent by  $C / P$  and the bottom 30 percent by  $GS$ . These portfolios are denoted Glamour and Value, respectively.

All numbers in the table are averages over all formation periods.

$E / P, C / P, S / P, D / P, B / M,$  and  $SIZE$ , defined below, use the end-of-April market value of equity and preformation year accounting numbers.  $E / P$  is the ratio of earnings to market value of equity.  $S / P$  is the ratio of sales to market value of equity.  $D / P$  is the ratio of dividends to market value of equity.  $B / M$  is the ratio of book value to market value of equity.  $SIZE$  is the total dollar value of equity (in millions).  $AEG_{(i,j)}$  is the geometric average growth rate of earnings for the portfolio from year  $i$  to year  $j$ .  $ACG_{(i,j)}$  and  $ASG_{(i,j)}$  are defined analogously for cash flow and sales, respectively.  $RETURN_{(-3,0)}$  is the cumulative stock return on the portfolio over the 3 years prior to formation.

# Are value stocks riskier?
- Fama and French (1992, 1993, and 1996) also find evidence that value stocks earn higher returns than growth or glamour stocks.
- Fama and French (1993) find high B/M stocks tend to have lower standard deviations and market betas than do low B/M stocks (Tables 2 and 4). Thus, on traditional measures of risk, value stocks are less risky.
- They argue, however, that value stocks face a higher systematic earnings distress risk than do glamour stocks:
- The earnings distress risk, according to FF, is due to the fact value stocks typically experience persistently low earnings, a risk not captured by the market beta.
- They propose a three-factor model to explain the variation in stock returns and for performance measurement:

$$ r _ {i t} - r _ {f t} = a _ {i} + b _ {i} \left(r _ {m t} - r _ {f t}\right) + s _ {i} S M B _ {t} + h _ {i} H M L _ {t} + \varepsilon_ {t}
$$

$\mathbf{r_{it} - r_{ft}}$  is the excess return on the stock or the portfolio

$\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{mt}} - \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{ft}}$  is the Market factor

SMB (Small Minus Big) is the Size factor, return spread between small stocks and large stocks.

HML (High Minus Low) is the Value factor, return spread between high B/M (value) and low B/M (growth) stocks.

The risk vs. mispricing debate is still unsettled.

# Contrarian strategies based on past stock returns

Another manifestation of value strategies is contrarian strategies based on past stock price performance (recall the Momentum Life Cycle).

Buy long-run losers and sell long-run winners.

Annual Stock Prices of Three Stocks

> Stocks with high past performance (high stock returns) underperform stocks with poor past performance where past performance is measured over the previous 5 years.
$\succ$  This is most likely due to the extrapolation bias.
$\succ$  Violation of weak form market efficiency.

# Evidence on contrarian strategies

$\succ$  DeBondt and Thaler (1985) provided initial evidence of this strategy. Results from Fama and French (1996) below.

At the beginning of each year or each month (say January 1, 2014) rank all stocks by their 5 year returns.

> Top  $10\%$  (R10) of the stocks with the highest returns are the long-term winners. Bottom  $10\%$  (R1) with the lowest returns are the long-term losers. Returns of (R1-R10) are below.

At the beginning of each month  $t$ , all NYSE firms on CRSP with returns for months  $t - x$  to  $t - y$  are allocated to deciles based on their continuously compounded returns between  $t - x$  and  $t - y$ . For example, firms are allocated to the 12-2 portfolios for January 1931 based on their continuously compounded returns for January 1930 through November 1930. Decile 1 contains the NYSE stocks with the lowest continuously compounded past returns. The portfolios are reformed monthly, and equal-weight simple returns in excess of the one-month bill rate are calculated for January 1931 (3101) to December 1993 (9312). The table shows the averages of these excess returns for 6307 to 9312 (366 months) and 3101 to 6306 (390 months).

- Returns are monthly averages in percent.
- Loser (1) outperforms winner (10) by  $0.13\%$  to  $1.6\%$  a month depending on the time-period (weaker post 1963). The (60-13) strategy which skips the most recent year performs better. Why?

# Fundamental Analysis and Value Investing
- Piotroski (2000) argues that financial statement variables can be used to separate value stocks into value winners and value losers (see the Momentum Life Cycle).
- Value winners are value firms that have stronger future prospects and are likely to turnaround while value losers are value trap firms which may be financially distressed and less likely to turnaround.
- Piotroski creates an aggregate fundamental signal based on several accounting ratios and uses the signal to divide the  $20\%$  of the stocks (in NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq) with the highest B/M ratios (most undervalued stocks) into winners and losers.
- Piotroski constructs his winner and loser portfolios every year from 1976 to 1996 based on the prior fiscal year's data and computes buy-and-hold returns over the next year.
- Piotroski refers to his fundamental signal as the  $F$ -Score.
- How would you use the F-Score in your final valuation project?

# F-Score

Construct binary variables (1 for positive signals and 0 for negative signals) based on nine fundamental ratios. Changes are computed as this year's ratio minus last year's ratio (fiscal or trailing 12 month).

# Profitability

NaN. Net income/Total Assets (ROA): (1 if positive, 0 otherwise). Positive ROA is a good signal (you can also use ROIC).

NaN. Cash flow from operations/Total Assets (CFO): (1 if positive, 0 otherwise). Positive CFO is a good signal.

NaN. Change in ROA ( $\Delta$ ROA): (1 if an increase, 0 otherwise). An increase in ROA is a good signal.

# Leverage/Liquidity

NaN. Change in  $LT$  debt-to-total assets (ΔLEVER) (1 if a decrease, 0 otherwise). A decrease in leverage is a good signal.

NaN. Change in a firm's Current Ratio (ratio of current assets to current liabilities)  $\Delta$  LIQUID (1 if an increase, 0 otherwise). An increase in liquidity is a good signal.

NaN. A dummy variable (EQ_OFFER) equal to 1 if the firm did not issue equity in the previous year, zero otherwise. Why?

# Operating Efficiency

NaN. Change in Gross Margin ratio (Gross income/Sales) (1 if an increase, 0 otherwise).

NaN. Change in Asset Turnover ratio (Sales/Total Assets) (1 if an increase, 0 otherwise) (you can also use Sales/Invested Capital).

Recall ROIC tree (Equation 4, page 8) in Lecture Note 4:

ROIC = Operating Profit Margin * Invested Capital Turnover

# Accrual

NaN. Accrual = (Net Income - Cash flow from operations)/Total Assets = ROA - CFO (1 for negative accruals, 0 for positive accruals). Positive or high accruals suggest a firm is not generating cash flows consistent with its reported earnings. We will discuss this in detail in the next lecture.

F-Score = Sum of the 9 binary scores above.

Maximum F-Score is 9; Minimum F-Score is 0.

A low F-score is bad and a high F-score is good.

Use F-Score to divide value stocks into value winners and value losers.

# Performance of F-Score Portfolios
- High F-score – Low F-score earns about  $23\%$  on average over the next twelve months (see Table 3).
- High F-Score is the long/buy side; Low F-Score is short/sell side.
- Returns are high among small firms which are illiquid. Among large firms, hedge returns are concentrated on the short side. See Table 4. Shorting is costly for individuals. Therefore, we focus on the long/buy side of the strategy which is high F-score.
- This suggests returns to this strategy are likely to be low in long only portfolios and for large institutional portfolios. These investors face capacity constraints in investing in small-cap and especially micro-cap stocks because of liquidity considerations.
- High (low) F-score stocks exhibit positive (negative) price momentum consistent with the intuition of the Momentum Life Cycle (Table 6).
See Table 7 for regression results that control for other effects.

# TABLE 3

# Buy-and-Hold Returns to a Value Investment Strategy Based on Fundamental Signals

This table presents buy-and-hold returns to a fundamental investment strategy based on purchasing high BM firms with strong fundamental signals  $F\_SCORE$  is equal to the sum of nine individual binary signals, or  $F\_SCORE = F\_ROA + F\_ROA + F\_CFO + F\_ACCRUAL + F\_AMARGIN + F\_ATURN + F\_ALIKEV + F\_ALIQUID + EQ_OFFER$ , where each binary signal equals one (zero) if the underlying realization is a good (bad) signal about future firm performance. A  $F\_SCORE$  equal to zero (nine) means the firm possesses the least (most) favorable set of financial signals. The Low  $F\_SCORE$  portfolio consists of firms with an aggregate score of 0 or 1; the High  $F\_SCORE$  portfolio consists of firms with a score of 8 or 9

Each year, all firms on Compustat with sufficient size and BM data are ranked on the basis of the most recent fiscal year-end market capitalization. The 353 and 667 percentile cutoffs from the prior year's distribution of firm size (MVE) are used to classify the high BM firms into small, medium, and large firms each year. All other definitions and test statistics are as described in table 3

- 59\% of the sample (n =8,302) is concentrated among small firms and only 13\% (n = 1,835) is concentrated among large firms.
- The excess returns in large cap value portfolios are lower. In small cap and especially micro-cap value portfolios, capacity may be limited because of liquidity constraints.
- The median market cap of Pietroski's sample (see Table 6) is only 14.37 million!

FIG. 1 —One-year market-adjusted returns to a hedge portfolio based on a fundamental analysis strategy by calendar year. This figure documents one-year market-adjusted returns by calendar year to a hedge portfolio taking a long position in firms with a strong  $F\_SCORE$  ( $F\_SCORE$  greater than or equal to 5) and a short position in firms with a weak  $F\_SCORE$  ( $F\_SCORE$  less than 5). Returns are cumulated over a one-year period starting four months after fiscal year-end. A market-adjusted return is defined as the firm's 12-month buy-and-hold return less the buy-and-hold return on the value-weighted market index over the same investment horizon

The figure above suggests the F-score long-short strategy earned positive returns in almost every year from 1977 to 1996.

The returns may not be as high for large institutional investors because of liquidity considerations.

Nevertheless, the intuition behind the F-Score is appealing.

Monthly Stock Prices of Three Stocks

> Momentum is evidence of return continuation. High returns followed by high returns and vice-versa.
> Returns over the 3 to 12 month horizon (referred to as the medium-term) are characterized by price momentum.
$\succ$  Underreaction to news is often cited as the cause of price momentum.

# Implementing price momentum strategies

At the beginning of each month (say January 1, 2000), rank all available stocks by their prior 6-month returns.

Divide the stocks into 10 portfolios. Top  $10\%$  (R10) of stocks with the highest returns are the medium-term winners and bottom  $10\%$  (R1) are the medium-term losers.

Buy the winners (R10) and sell the losers (R1).

$\succ$  Contrast this with long-horizon contrarian strategies where we buy long-term losers and sell long-term winners.

> Hold this long-short momentum portfolio for horizons ranging from 3 to 12 months and compute the average return earned by this portfolio.
$\succ$  Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) originally implemented this strategy using historical data from 1963 to 1990 and found that the winners outperformed the losers on average by  $0.7\%$  to  $1.5\%$  a month. Annualized, this translates to  $8.4\%$  to  $18\%$  a year.
> Momentum strategies are higher portfolio turnover strategies compared to value strategies and hence face potentially higher transaction costs.

# Table I Returns to Price Momentum Portfolios

This table presents average monthly and annual returns in percentages for price momentum portfolio strategies involving NYSE/AMEX stocks for the time period from 1965 to 1995. At the beginning of each month starting in January 1965, all stocks in the NYSE and AMEX are sorted based on their previous  $J$  months' returns and divided into 10 equal-weighted portfolios.  $R1$  represents the loser portfolio with the lowest returns, and  $R10$  represents the winner portfolio with the highest returns during the previous  $J$  months.  $K$  represents monthly holding periods where  $K =$  three, six, nine, or 12 months. Monthly holding period returns are computed as an equal-weighted average of returns from strategies initiated at the beginning of this month and past months. The annual returns (Year 1, Year 2, Year 3, Year 4, and Year 5) are computed as event time returns for five 12-month periods following the portfolio formation date. Return refers to the geometric average monthly return in percentages, and Volume represents the average daily turnover in percentages, both measured over the portfolio formation period,  $J$ .  $SzRnk$  represents the time-series average of the median size decile of the portfolio (based on NYSE/AMEX stocks in the sample) on the portfolio formation date. Price represents the time-series average of the median stock price of the portfolio in dollars on the portfolio formation date. The numbers in parentheses represent  $t$ -statistics. The  $t$ -statistics for monthly return ( $K =$  three, six nine, or 12) are simple  $t$ -statistics, whereas those for annual returns are based on the Hansen-Hodrick (1980) correction for autocorrelation up to lag 11.

The above table reproduces only a portion of Table I.

- J refers to the measurement period and K refers to the holding period. Past returns are computed for the prior 6 months (J=6), the momentum portfolios constructed, and the stocks held for 3, 6, 9, or 12 months (K=3, 6, 9, or 12). The holding period returns are reported in \% per month.
- Winners outperform losers by about  $1\%$  per month or  $12\%$  annualized which is a violation of weak-form market efficiency.
- Multiple monthly averages by 12 to annualize them. The numbers in parentheses are t-statistics. t-statistic  $>2$  is significant.

- Trading volume is low when stocks are out of favor (neglected) and high when stocks are in favor (glamorous).
- Early stage momentum strategy: Buy low volume winners (R10V1) and Sell high volume losers (R1V3).
- Late stage momentum strategy: Buy high volume winners (R10V3) and Sell low volume losers (R1V1).
- Tables V and IX show that low volume stocks behave like value stocks and high volume stocks behave like glamour stocks.

# Early and Late Stage Strategies Based on Price Momentum and Trading Volume

This table summarizes annual returns from early (R10V1-R1V3 or R5V1-R1V5) and late stage (R10V3-R1V1 or R5V5-R1V1) price momentum-trading volume strategies and compares them to the returns from a simple price momentum strategy (R10-R1 or R5-R1) for the time period 1965-1995. Early represents a zero investment portfolio that is long low volume winners (R10V1 or R5V1) and short high volume losers (R1V3 or R1V5). Late represents a zero investment portfolio that is long high volume winners (R10V3 or R5V5) and short low volume losers (R1V1).  $R1$  represents the loser portfolio with the lowest returns and  $R10$  represents the winner portfolio with the highest returns during the previous 6 months.  $V1$  represents the portfolio with the lowest trading volume and  $V3$  ( $V5$ ) represents the portfolio with the highest trading volume when 3 (5) volume portfolios are formed. The volume is computed as the average daily turnover over the previous six months. Year1, Year2, Year3, Year4 and Year5 represent the compounded returns in each of the five 12-month periods following the portfolio formation month. The number of monthly observations is 325 except for Panel D, where it is 265. The numbers within parentheses are t-statistics computed with the Hansen-Hodrick autocorrelation correction up to 11 lags.

# Earnings Momentum Strategies
- These are strategies based on a firm's quarterly earnings surprises and revisions in security analyst earnings forecasts.
- Buy stocks with positive earnings momentum and sell stocks with negative earnings momentum.

# Three measures of earnings momentum

1. Quarterly earnings surprises referred to as standardized unexpected earnings (SUE).
2. Price reaction around quarterly earnings announcements referred to as cumulative abnormal returns (CAR).
3. Revisions in consensus analyst forecasts of annual and quarterly earnings of a firm referred to as analyst forecast revisions (FREV).

The hypothesis is that stocks with positive earnings momentum should outperform stocks with negative earnings momentum over a 3 to 6 month period after the portfolio formation date.

We will review evidence presented by Chan, Jegadeesh and Lakonishok (1996) on the profitability of these strategies.

Typically we look for stocks with extreme momentum.

# Standardized unexpected earnings (SUE)

At the beginning of a month, measure SUE for each stock as follows:

$$
S U E _ {i, t} = \frac {e _ {i , q} - e _ {i , q - 4} - \mu_ {i}}{\sigma_ {i}}
$$

$\mathbf{e}_{\mathrm{i,q}} =$  This quarter's earnings (September 2022)

$\mathrm{e}_{\mathrm{i}, \mathrm{q}-4} =$  Earnings the same calendar quarter last year (September 2014)

$\mu_{i} = \text{Average seasonal change in quarterly earnings measured over the prior 8 quarters}$

$\sigma_{i} =$  Standard deviation of changes in quarterly earnings over the prior 8 quarters.

Since the unexpected earnings are standardized by the standard deviation, this is referred to as the standardized unexpected earnings (SUE).

Initially studied by Foster, Olsen, and Shevlin (1984) and Bernard and Thomas (1989).

You can also define the earnings surprise relative to consensus earnings forecasts: (Actual - Forecast)/Forecast (if Forecast > 0) or (Actual - Forecast)/Dispersion in Forecasts.

# Table III Mean Returns and Characteristics for Portfolios Classified by Standardized Unexpected Earnings

At the beginning of every month from January 1977 to January 1993, all stocks are ranked by their most recent past standardized unexpected earnings and assigned to one of ten portfolios. Standardized unexpected earnings is unexpected earnings (the change in quarterly earnings per share from its value four quarters ago) divided by the standard deviation of unexpected earnings over the last eight quarters. The assignment uses breakpoints based on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) issues only. All stocks are equally-weighted in a portfolio. The sample includes all NYSE, American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and Nasdaq domestic primary issues with coverage on the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and COMPUSTAT. Panel A reports the average past six-month return for each portfolio, and buy-and-hold returns over periods following portfolio formation (in the following six months and in the first, second, and third subsequent years). Panel B reports accounting characteristics for each portfolio: book value of common equity relative to market value, and cash flow (earnings plus depreciation) relative to market value. Panel C reports each portfolio's most recent past and subsequent values of quarterly standardized unexpected earnings. Panel D reports abnormal returns around earnings announcement dates. Abnormal returns are relative to the equally-weighted market index and are cumulated from two days before to one day after the date of earnings announcement. In Panel E, averages of percentage revisions relative to the beginning-of-month stock price in monthly mean I/B/E/S estimates of current fiscal-year earnings per share are reported.

- At the beginning of each month form 10 portfolios based on the most recent quarter's SUE. 10 is the winner portfolio with the most positive earnings surprises, 1 is the loser portfolio with the most negative earnings surprises. Winners outperform losers by about  $7\%$  over the next 6 months (this is referred to as the post-earnings announcement drift).
- Earnings momentum disappears after 6 months.

# Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR)

The price reaction around a quarterly earnings announcement (CAR) is measured as follows:

$$
C A R _ {i, t} = \sum_ {k = - 2} ^ {+ 1} (r _ {i, k} - r _ {m, k})
$$ where day ‘0’ is the day of the announcement. We start from day -2 and go till day +1 to capture any pre-announcement information leakage.


$$

\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {r} _ {\mathrm {i}, \mathrm {k}} = \text {s t o c k r e t u r n o n d a y} ^ {\prime} \mathrm {k} ^ {\prime} \\ r _ {m, k} = \text {m a r k e t (S & P 5 0 0) r e t u r n o n d a y ' k '} \\ \end{array}

$$
- CAR is the return earned by the stock relative to the market around the earnings announcement date.
- Positive return suggests market interpreted earnings news as good news and negative return suggests market interpreted earnings news as bad news.
- Also studied by Foster, Olsen, and Shevlin (1984).

# Mean Returns and Characteristics for Portfolios Classified by Abnormal Return Around Earnings Announcement

At the beginning of every month from January 1977 to January 1993, all stocks are ranked by their abnormal return around the most recent past announcement of quarterly earnings and assigned to one of ten portfolios. Abnormal returns are relative to the equally-weighted market index and are cumulated from two days before to one day after the date of earnings announcement. The assignment uses breakpoints based on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) issues only. All stocks are equally-weighted in a portfolio. The sample includes all NYSE, American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and Nasdaq domestic primary issues with coverage on Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and COMPUSTAT. Panel A reports the average past six-month return for each portfolio, and buy-and-hold returns over periods following portfolio formation (in the following six months and in the first, second, and third subsequent years). Panel B reports accounting characteristics for each portfolio: book value of common equity relative to market value, and cash flow (earnings plus depreciation) relative to market value. Panel C reports each portfolio's most recent past and subsequent values of quarterly standardized unexpected earnings (the change in quarterly earnings per share from its value four quarters ago, divided by the standard deviation of unexpected earnings over the last eight quarters). Panel D reports abnormal returns around earnings announcement dates. In Panel E, averages of percentage revisions relative to the beginning-of-month stock price in monthly mean I/B/E/S estimates of current fiscal-year earnings per share are reported.

- At the beginning of each month form 10 portfolios based on the most recent quarter's CAR. 10 is the winner portfolio with the most positive earnings surprise, 1 is the loser portfolio with the most negative earnings surprise.
- Winners outperform losers by about  $6 \%$ in the first 6 months.

# Analyst forecast revisions (FREV)
- Security analysts provide forecasts of next year's earnings per share (EPS). Consensus forecasts are the average of individual earnings forecasts.
- Changes in the consensus are a measure of the momentum in the earnings expectations of a firm.

Revisions in consensus forecasts over the prior J months:

$$

F R E V _ {i, t} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {J} \frac {f _ {i , t - j} - f _ {i , t - j - 1}}{P _ {i , t - j - 1}}

$$

The forecast  $(\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{i},\mathrm{t} - \mathrm{j}})$  in month  $j$  minus the forecast in month  $j-1$  ( $\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{i},\mathrm{t} - \mathrm{j} - 1}$ ) scaled by the stock price at the end of month  $j-1$  ( $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i},\mathrm{t} - \mathrm{j} - 1}$ ). Take the sum of this scaled change over the prior  $J = 3$  or 6 months.

We can compute revisions for fiscal year 1 forecast (FY1), fiscal year 2 forecast (FY2), and also for quarterly forecasts.

# Monthly Cross-Sectional Regressions of Returns on Prior Return and Prior Earnings Surprises

Cross-sectional regressions are estimated each month from January 1977 to January 1993 of individual stock returns on size, compound return over the prior six months (R6), the abnormal return relative to the equally-weighted market index cumulated from two days before to one day after the most recent past announcement date of quarterly earnings (ABR), unexpected earnings (the change in the most recent past quarterly earnings per share from its value four quarters ago) scaled by the standard deviation of unexpected earnings over the past eight quarters (SUE), and a moving average of the past six months' revisions in I/B/E/S mean analyst earnings forecasts relative to beginning-of-month stock price (REV6). In the regression each explanatory variable is expressed in terms of its percentile rank and scaled to fall between zero and one. The dependent variable is the stock's buy-and-hold return either over the subsequent six months (Panel A), or over the next year (Panel B). The reported statistics are the means of the time series of coefficients from the month-by-month regressions, and in parentheses the  $t$ -statistics relative to the autocorrelation-adjusted standard error of the mean. The sample includes all domestic primary firms on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and Nasdaq with coverage on the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and COMPUSTAT.

# Market inefficiency and limited arbitrage

Why doesn't arbitrage eliminate these "inefficiencies/mispricing?"

Two possible explanations:

These are not inefficiencies. These are rational risk premium for some unknown systematic risk!
> Arbitrage is neither cost-less nor risk-less.

# Limited Arbitrage (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997)
- Arbitrageurs face finite investment horizons, are risk averse, and have limited capital.
- Strategies that are highly volatile and where prices may take a while to converge to fundamental value are quite risky for arbitrageurs and hard to fully arbitrage away.
- With high volatility, the risk the arbitrageurs face is that convergence may not occur during their "short" investment horizon and prices may in fact diverge further away from the fundamental value raising the risk of further capital loss. Can you think of examples? This is the noise trader risk.
- Most of the inefficiencies tend to be concentrated among small or illiquid stocks where risk and transaction costs are high. Investors may also be slow to learn about these strategies.

# Incorporating this information in security analysis

Once stock valuation is determined, we would like to know the stock's:
- Price momentum
- Most recent quarterly earnings surprises (SUE and CAR)
Changes in analyst earnings forecasts before a decision is made to buy or sell the stock.


Thus, momentum signals can be used effectively to provide timing decisions to avoid being too early to long or short a stock.

The results on price momentum and trading volume provided an early taste of how value and momentum might be combined.

We will now discuss some direct findings on the interaction of value and momentum.

# The Interaction between Value and Momentum

Asness (1997) examines value and momentum interaction.

Monthly data from July 1963 to December 1994 for all firms in NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq.
- Momentum: PAST(2,12) is the average monthly return of a stock starting 12 months ago and ending a month ago (skipping the most recent month to avoid the one-month reversals).

For a portfolio formation date of January 1, 2022, the returns are averaged over 11 months: January 2014 to November 2014.
- Value: Log B/M (Stock) - Log B/M (Industry).
$\circ$  This measure of value determines how cheap or expensive a company is within its industry.
- Each month sort all stocks independently into 5 Value portfolios and 5 Momentum portfolios. The intersection of the  $5 \times 5$  gives 25 Value-Momentum portfolios.
- The results are in Table 4 of the paper and presented on the next page. The results are average monthly returns in\%. Multiply them by 12 to annualize them approximately.
- Tables 1 to 3 show that winners are expensive and losers are Cheap. Value and Momentum are negatively correlated. Does this help or hurt portfolio diversification?

bTest similar to that described in Footnote a but for long/short portfolios formed on the row variable that attempt to hold the column variable constant.

How does momentum perform among value (cheap) and growth (expensive) stocks? How does value perform among winners and losers? Explain?

How does this compare to the findings on Volume and Momentum?

Relate to the Momentum Life Cycle.

Conclusion: Buy Value-Winners and Sell Growth/Glamour Losers.

# Value and Momentum Everywhere

The intuition behind the Momentum Life Cycle (MLC) is not unique to stocks. It applies equally well to asset classes other than stocks such as country stock indices, bonds, currencies, real estate, and commodities.

Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) examine the profitability of value and momentum strategies among:
- Individual stocks in the United States, United Kingdom, Developed Continental Europe, and Japan,
Country equity index futures
Government bonds
Currencies
Commodity futures a) They find that value and momentum strategies work in each of these markets and are also negatively correlated with each other.

b) Value strategies are positively correlated across different markets and momentum strategies are also positively correlated across different markets.
c) They construct a global three-factor model consisting of a global market factor, a global value factor and a global momentum factor covering all asset classes.
d) There is very little correlation between these factors and macroeconomic variables.

# Value and momentum measures in different markets

Individual Stocks and Country Stock Indices: B/M Ratios (MSCI reports B/M ratios for countries)

For the next three markets, value is defined based on the past performance measure of DeBondt and Thaler (1985).

Commodities:  $\mathrm{Log(P_{t-5} / P_t)}$ , where  $P_t$  is the spot price of the commodity, this is simply the negative of the past five-year returns.

Currencies:  $\mathrm{Log}(\mathrm{SE}_{\mathrm{t - 5}} / \mathrm{SE}_{\mathrm{t}})$  -  $\mathrm{Log}(1 + \mathrm{h_f}) / \mathrm{Log}(1 + \mathrm{h_d})$  , where  $\mathrm{SE_t}$  is the spot exchange measured as the price of foreign currency in dollars,  $\mathrm{h_f}$  and  $\mathrm{h_d}$  are the 5-year foreign and U.S. inflation rates. This measures the 5-year decline in the purchasing power parity.

Bonds: 5-Year change in YTM of bonds; since yields move inversely with prices an increase in yield implies drop in prices and vice-versa.

High values indicate value and low values indicate glamour.

Price momentum is simply the 11 month return MOM(2,12) starting 12 months ago and ending a month ago.

Value and momentum factors are dollar-neutral long-short portfolios that take a position on every security based on its rank.

Alphas are the intercepts from a 1-factor market model.

Overall the evidence suggests value and momentum work everywhere, and combining value and momentum is a good investment strategy.

# Recap
- Momentum Life Cycle Model Framework
- Value strategies and Past performance (contrarian) strategies
- Enhancing Value strategies using financial statement information: Value Winners and value Losers
- Momentum strategies
- Enhancing momentum strategies using trading volume into early-stage (buy low volume winner and sell high volume loser) and late-stage (buy high volume winner and sell low volume loser) strategies
- Interaction between value and momentum; value and momentum are negatively correlated; momentum works better among glamour/growth/expensive stocks and value works better among losers
- Value and momentum work everywhere.
- Risk vs. Mispricing debate and Limited Arbitrage.
