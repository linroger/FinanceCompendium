# Lecture Note 11 Accruals, Asset Growth and External Financing

# Free Cash Flows to the Firm (FCFF)

From equation (3) of Lecture Note 3:

$$
F C F F (t) = N O P A T (t) + D e p (t) - \Delta W C (t) - C a p E x (t) \tag {1}
$$

NOPAT(t) = Net operating profits after taxes for year 't'.

Dep(t) = Depreciation & Amortization for year 't'.

$\Delta \mathrm{WC}(t)$  = Change in operating working capital for year 't'.

CapEx(t) = Capital expenditures and acquisitions.

Gross investment (GI):

$$
G I (t) = \operatorname {C a p E x} (t) + \Delta W C (t) \tag {2}
$$

The net new investment:

$$
I (t) = \underbrace {\left[ C a p E x (t) + \Delta W C (t) \right]} _ {\text {G r o s s I n v e s t m e n t}} - \underbrace {D e p (t)} _ {\text {R e p l a c e m e n t I n v e s t m e n t}} \tag {3}
$$

$$
F C F F (t) = N O P A T (t) - I (t) \tag {4}
$$

FCFF is the residual cash left over from profits after a firm has reinvested a portion of its profits in the firm.

The accounting literature refers to the net new investment as Total Accruals and [ΔWC – Dep] as Working Capital Accruals.

# Working capital accruals (Sloan, 1996)

Cash flow from operations (CFO) (in general):

$$
\begin{array}{l} C F O (t) = N e t I n c o m e (t) + D e p (t) - \Delta W C (t) \\ = \operatorname {N e t I n c o m e} (t) - \left[ \Delta W C (t) - D e p (t) \right] \tag {5} \\ = \operatorname {N e t I n c o m e} (t) - W C A (t) \\ \end{array}
$$

From equation (5):

$$
\operatorname {N e t I n c o m e} (t) = C F O (t) + W C A (t) \tag {6}
$$
- CFO represents permanent earnings (less mean-reverting) because CFO is less subject to accounting distortions.
- WCA represents temporary earnings (more mean-reverting) possibly due to managerial manipulation because it contains receivables, inventory, etc.
- Since WCA is a dollar number, typically it is scaled by average total assets (see Sloan, 1996) or invested capital.
- WCA/Average Total Assets or WCA/Average Invested Capital.

# FIGURE 1

Time Series Properties of Earnings, Accruals and Operating Cash Flows. Year 0 is the year in which firms are ranked and assigned in equal numbers to ten portfolios based on each of the three respective variables. Earnings is measured as income from continuing operations scaled by average total assets for the year. Accruals is the change in non-cash current assets, less the change in current liabilities (exclusive of short-term debt and taxes payable), less depreciation expense, all divided by average total assets. Cash flow is the difference between earnings and accruals (as defined above).

# Earnings Quality and Stock Returns
- Earnings accompanied by extreme accruals tend to revert faster than earnings accompanied by extreme cash flows. Thus, the cash flow component of earnings seems more persistent than the accrual component of earnings. Extrapolation bias?
- Sloan (1996) shows that investors, contrary to the observed empirical results, treat the accrual component as more persistent than the cash flow component.
- If high earnings are due to high accruals and low cash flows (due to increase in receivables, inventory, decrease in payables, etc.) then the earnings are considered to be of lower earnings quality. See equation (6).
- If high earnings are due to low accruals and high cash flows then the earnings are considered to be of higher earnings quality.
- If investors are unable to distinguish between low quality and high quality earnings and focus only on quantity, they would overvalue stocks with high accruals (and lower cash flows) and undervalue stocks with low accruals (and higher cash flows).
- Thus, a strategy of long low accrual stocks and short high accrual stocks should outperform. The results suggest investors have an earnings fixation. They focus on earnings more than they do on cash flows.
- Where are high accrual and low accrual portfolios in the MLC?

Portfolios are formed annually by assigning firms into deciles based on the magnitude of accruals in year t. The values in parentheses are t-statistics based on the time-series of the annual portfolio abnormal stock returns.

Accruals is the change in non-cash current assets, less the change in current liabilities (exclusive of short-term debt and taxes payable), less depreciation expense, all divided by average total assets.

b The size-adjusted returns are computed by taking the raw buy-hold return, inclusive of dividends and any liquidating distributions and subtracting the buy-hold return on a size matched, value-weighted portfolio of firms. The size portfolios are based on market-value of equity deciles of NYSE and AMEX firms. The decile rankings and decile returns are supplied by CRSP. The return cumulation period begins four months after the fiscal year-end of the year in which the level of operating accruals is measured. The return cumulation period begins four months after the fiscal year-end.

The Jensen alpha is the estimated value of  $\alpha$  from  $(R_{pt} - R_{ft}) = \alpha_p + \beta_p(R_{mt} - R_{ft}) + \varepsilon_{pt}$ , where  $R_{pt}$  denotes the raw buy-hold return to portfolio p in year t, inclusive of dividends and liquidating distributions.  $R_{ft}$  is the risk free rate, measured using the contemporaneous annual T-bill yield.  $R_{mt}$  is the market return, estimated by cumulating CRSP monthly returns on the equal-weighted NYSE/AMEX index. The return cumulation period begins four months after the fiscal year-end.

d The hedge portfolio consists of a long position in the lowest accrual portfolio and an offsetting short position in the highest accrual portfolio.

Returns are cumulated over a one-year period beginning four months after the fiscal year end. Accruals is the change in non-cash current assets, less the change in current liabilities (exclusive of short-term debt and taxes payable), less depreciation expense, all divided by average total assets.

# Which component of accruals is more mispriced?

Working capital accruals consist of several components:

Change in current operating assets:

Change in receivables + Change in Inventory + Change in other current operating assets

Change in current operating liabilities:

Change in accounts payable + Change in other current operating liabilities

# They confirm Sloan's findings and also examine the mispricing of various components of accruals.

Note. The sample comprises all domestic common stocks (except financial firms) on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ with coverage on CRSP and Compustat, and with available data. At the end of April each year from 1971 to 1995, all stocks are ranked by accruals relative to average total assets and assigned to one of 10 equally weighted portfolios (assuming a reporting delay of four months from the end of the fiscal year). Average values of accruals, earnings, and characteristics for each portfolio are presented in panels A and B. All the above items are divided by average total firm assets. Average annual buy-and-hold returns are presented in panel C for each year from three years prior to portfolio formation to three years after formation, along with the difference between the bottom and top deciles and the t-statistic for the mean difference. Panel D reports average annual returns in excess of the return on control portfolios matched by size and book-to-market. Log size is the natural logarithm of market value of equity (in millions of dollars); book-to-market is the ratio of book to market value of equity; average annual growth in sales over the prior three years is the average of the value-weighted annual growth rate in sales of each portfolio over the three years prior to portfolio formation. Other variables are defined in the note to table 1.

# 1 is low accrual portfolio, 10 is high accrual portfolios

The accrual effect is concentrated among high accrual portfolios. Thus, it is more of a short or sell signal.

High accrual portfolios have high past performance but exhibit poor future performance up to three years after portfolio formation.

Portfolios are formed in April of each year (1971-1995) and abnormal returns are computed relative to size- $B/M$  portfolios.

Earnings-to-Sales

- Firms with high accruals experience extreme growth in earnings, cash flows, accounts receivables, inventories and accounts payable from Year -1 to 0.
- It is possible accruals grow with sales or in anticipation of future sales; however sales (asset) turnover (sales/avg.total assets) remain flat in the pre-formation years (-5 to 0) and decline in the post-formation years (0 to +5) for the high accrual firms.
- The sudden decline in earnings and sales in Year +1 raises the possibility of prior years' managerial earnings manipulation perhaps to avoid a disappointing earnings report.

Note. The sample comprises all domestic common stocks (except financial firms) on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ with coverage on CRSP and Compustat, and with available data. At the end of April each year from 1971 to 1995, all stocks are ranked by a component of accruals relative to average total assets and assigned to one of 10 portfolios (assuming a reporting delay of four months from the end of the fiscal year). Annual buy-and-hold returns are calculated over the subsequent year, as well as returns in excess of the return on a control portfolio matched by size and book-to-market. Average returns in each of the first to third years following portfolio formation (R1, R2, and R3, respectively) and excess returns in each of the first to third postformation years (AR1, AR2, and AR3) on the equally weighted decile portfolios are reported. Also reported is the difference between the bottom and top decile portfolios and the t-statistic for the mean difference.

- Every component except "change in other current liabilities" appears mispriced. "Change in inventory" produces the biggest spread in returns. An increase in each of the components produces lower returns.
- An increase in accounts payable which lowers accruals also appears to generate poor returns perhaps because investors are slow to realize slowing business prospects. Explain?

# Are the results driven by extrapolation bias?
- Extrapolation bias suggests investors ignore regression to mean and extrapolate past performance too far into the future.
- Could the accrual results be due to extrapolation bias since firms with high growth in sales tend to also have high growth in working capital (accruals)?
- The authors decompose accruals into discretionary and non-discretionary accruals. Non-discretionary accruals are those required to support the current level of sales. Discretionary accruals represent excess beyond what is required.

of working capital for a firm to its current sales. For example, in the case inventory,  $I_{it}$  and sales,  $\mathrm{Sales}_{it}$  for firm  $i$  in year  $t$ , we define

$$
E _ {t} \left(I _ {t t}\right) = \frac {\sum_ {k = 1} ^ {5} I _ {t t - k}}{\sum_ {k = 1} ^ {5} \text {S a l e s} _ {t t - k}} \text {S a l e s} _ {t t}.
$$

The nondiscretionary change in inventory,  $\mathrm{NDI}_{it}$  is then given by

$$
\mathrm {N D I} _ {i t} = E _ {t} \left(I _ {i t}\right) - I _ {i t - 1},
$$ and the discretionary change in inventory,  $DI_{it}$  is


$$

D I _ {i t} = I _ {i t} - E _ {t} \left(I _ {i t}\right).

$$

Expected accruals are computed based on past ratios of inventory to sales. Growth in accruals beyond that needed to support increasing sales is discretionary and due to managerial manipulation.

The 'I' above refers to inventory not net new investments.

Note. The sample comprises all domestic common stocks (except financial firms) on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ with coverage on CRSP and Compustat, and with available data. At the end of April each year from 1971 to 1995, all stocks are ranked by accruals (discretionary or nondiscretionary) relative to average total assets. On the basis of the ranking, stocks are assigned to one of 10 portfolios (assuming a reporting delay of four months from the end of the fiscal year). Annual buy-and-hold returns are calculated over the subsequent year, as well as returns in excess of the return on a control portfolio matched by size and book-to-market. Raw returns and excess returns in each of the three years following portfolio formation(R1-R3 and AR1-AR3, respectively) on the equally weighted decile portfolios are reported. The return spread between the bottom and top deciles, 1-10, and its t-statistic, as well as the spread between the second and ninth deciles, 2-9, and its t-statistic, are also reported. Accruals are defined as the change in noncash current assets less the change in current liabilities excluding short-term debt and taxes payable and minus depreciation. Each of the relevant current asset and current liability items for firm i in year  $t_i$ ,  $I_{it}$ , is related to the firm's current-year sales, Sales, as in eq. (2). The nondiscretionary component of the change in an item is given by  $E_{i}(I_{it}) - I_{it-1}$ , and the discretionary component is  $I_{it} - E_{i}(I_{it})$ .

All of the mispricing is due to discretionary accruals.

There is no spread in returns when portfolios are formed based on non-discretionary accruals.

The results suggest the accrual results are perhaps due to earnings manipulation.

AR refers to abnormal returns relative to a control portfolio matched by size and book-to-market.

# Total Accruals (TAC) and Asset Growth

The reinvestment rate (b) is the ratio of net new investments to net operating profits after taxes:

$$ b (t) = \frac {I (t)}{N O P A T (t)} \tag {7}
$$

Invested capital (IC) is the sum of net operating working capital and net fixed and long-term operating assets. Change in invested capital equals net new investments:

$$
I (t) = I C (t) - I C (t - 1) \tag {8a}
$$

$$
I (t) = \underbrace {\left[ C a p E x (t) + \Delta W C (t) \right]} _ {\text {G r o s s I n v e s t m e n t}} - \underbrace {D e p (t)} _ {\text {R e p l a c e m e n t I n v e s t m e n t}} \tag {8b}
$$

Product of reinvestment rate (b) and the return on invested capital ROIC gives growth in invested capital gIC:

$$
\begin{array}{l} g I C (t) = b (t) \times R O I C (t) \\ = \frac {I (t)}{N O P A T (t)} \times \frac {N O P A T (t)}{I C (t - 1)} \tag {9} \\ = \frac {I _ {t}}{I C _ {t - 1}} = \frac {I C (t) - I C (t - 1)}{I C (t - 1)} \\ \end{array}
$$

Bhojraj and Swaminathan (2009) refer to the growth in invested capital as the net new investment accruals NNI. (1-b) is capacity to pay all investors from operating profits.

# Growth in invested capital

Growth in invested capital or net operating assets is the same as the total accrual measure suggested by Richardson, Sloan, Soliman, and Tuna (2005).

Equation (9) shows that this total accrual measure is influenced by a firm's capital expenditure policy as well as its profitability captured by the return on invested capital.

In the empirical literature, different proxies of this total accrual measure have been used: growth in total assets, growth in net operating assets, change in net operating assets divided by total assets, or capital expenditures divided by total assets.

Given the findings that high working capital accrual firms underperform low working capital accrual firms, the hypothesis with respect to total accruals is that firms with high total accruals should also underperform.

Or in other words, firms with high growth in their total assets, net operating assets, or invested capital should underperform.

# Empirical findings on growth in total assets

Cooper, Gulen, and Schill (2008) examine the predictive power of annual growth in total assets. Growth in Total Assets for year 't' is:

$$
\mathrm {g T A} (t) = [ \mathrm {T A} (t) - \mathrm {T A} (t - 1) ] / \mathrm {T A} (t - 1)
$$

At the end of June of each year  $t$  over 1968 to 2002, stocks are allocated into deciles based on asset growth rates defined as the percentage change in total assets from the fiscal year ending in calendar year  $t - 2$  to fiscal year ending in calendar year  $t - 1$ . Equaland value-weighted portfolios are formed based on  $\text{June}(t)$  asset growth decile cutoffs. The portfolios are held for 1 year, from July of year  $t$  to June of year  $t + 1$ , and then rebalanced. Portfolio return statistics are reported every year for 10 years around the portfolio formation year  $(t)$  over the period of July 1968 to June of 2003. Panel A reports average annual asset growth rates. Panel B.1 reports average monthly raw returns to equal-weighted portfolios and Panel B.2 reports average monthly raw returns to value-weighted portfolios. Panel C.1 reports three-factor alphas of the equal-weighted portfolios and Panel C.2 reports three-factor alphas of the value-weighted portfolios for all firms and for three size-sorted groups. The size groups are defined by ranking firms into one of three groups (small, medium, and large) using the  $30^{\text{th}}$  and  $70^{\text{th}}$  NYSE market equity percentiles in June of year  $t$ . Panel D.1 reports subperiod three-factor alphas of the equal-weighted portfolios and Panel D.2 reports subperiod three-factor alphas of the value-weighted portfolios. In Panel A, the year  $-1$  row reports the asset growth rates from fiscal year ending in calendar year  $t - 2$  to  $t - 1$ , year 1 reports the asset growth rates from fiscal year ending in calendar year  $t - 1$  to  $t$ , etc. In Panel B, the year  $-1$  row reports the portfolio returns over July  $(t - 1)$  – June  $(t)$  and year 1 reports the portfolio returns over July  $(t)$  – June  $(t + 1)$ . In Panel B,  $[-5, -1]$  ([1, 5]) is the cumulative portfolio return over the 5 years prior (after) the portfolio formation period. All numbers, with the exception of the  $t$ -statistics, are in decimal form, that is 0.01 is  $1\%$ .

- In each of the past 5 years high asset growth firms have outperformed low asset growth firms (these are average monthly returns, multiply them by 12 to get a rough annual return number).
- Starting in Year  $+1$ , over the next five years high asset growth firms underperform low asset growth firms.
- Cumulative over the prior 5 years, high asset growth firms outperform low asset growth firms by  $538\%$ ; however over the next 5 years they underperform by about  $50\%$ .
- The results suggest we should avoid firms with very high growth in their total assets. Why? Extrapolation bias? Overinvestment?

- Year 1 alphas from Fama-French 3-factor model show that the results are not driven by size or value effects.
- Most of the effect seems to be driven by the underperformance of high asset growth firms. The spread in returns between portfolio 10 (high asset growth) and portfolio 1 (low asset growth) is mostly due to the negative returns of portfolio 10. Just like the accrual findings, this is also a short or sell signal.
- The negative performance of high asset growth firms seems to have become stronger over time. Perhaps due to the tech bubble of the 1998 and 1999? Any thoughts?
- Fama-French alphas are the intercept from running a regression of the monthly returns of a portfolio on the three factors: market factor, size factor (SMB), and the value factor (HML). See page 10 of Lecture Note 10 on Value and Momentum.

# Controlling for other effects

Annual stock returns from July 1968 to June 2003 are regressed on lagged accounting and return-based variables.  $BM$  (book-to-market ratio) is calculated using the Compustat data in the fiscal year ending in calendar year  $t - 1$  and is defined as in Davis, Fama, and French (2000).  $MV$  is the  $\mathrm{June}(t)$  market value,  $BHRET6$  is the buy-and-hold return over January(t)-June(t),  $BHRET36$  is the 36-month buy and hold return over July(t-3) to June(t),  $CI$  is the measure of abnormal capital investment as defined in Titman, Wei, and Xie (2004),  $L2ASSETG$  is the asset growth defined as the percentage change in total assets from the fiscal year ending in calendar year  $t - 3$  to fiscal year ending in calendar year  $t - 2$ ,  $ASSETG$  is the asset growth defined as the percentage change in total assets from the fiscal year ending in calendar year  $t - 2$  to fiscal year ending in calendar year  $t - 1$ ,  $5YASSETG$  is a 5-year weighted average rank of asset growth, and  $5YSALESG$  is a 5-year weighted average rank of growth rate in sales. ACCRUALS is from Sloan (1996) and NOA/A is net operating assets divided by total assets adjusted from Hirshleifer, Hou, Teoh, and Zhang (2004). More details on the construction of these variables are provided in the Appendix. Size groups are defined by ranking firms into one of three groups (small, medium, and large) using the  $30^{\text{th}}$  and  $70^{\text{th}}$  NYSE market equity percentiles in June of year  $t$ . Panel A reports regressions for all firms, and Panels B, C, and D report regressions for small, medium, and large firms, respectively. Beta estimates are time-series averages of cross-sectional regression betas obtained from annual cross-sectional regressions. The  $t$ -statistics, in parentheses, are adjusted for autocorrelation in the beta estimates.

- Asset growth is a strong predictor of next year's stock returns even after controlling for value, past sales growth, momentum, accruals, capital expenditures, etc.
- The results are strong even for large size firms (Panel D).
- The results in this paper show that asset growth is the strongest predictor of returns.
- The slope coefficients are annual returns and the t-statistics are in parentheses.

# Components of asset growth
- Growth in total assets can be due to:

Growth in cash.

Growth in current assets

Growth in fixed assets.

- How do these different components of assets contribute to the asset growth results?
- Growth in total assets can be financed by:

Growth in operating liabilities

Growth in debt financing

Growth in (external) equity financing

Growth in retained earnings

- How do these different types of financing contribute to the asset growth effect?
Equity = Preferred Stock + Minority Interest + Common Stock - Retained Earnings
- Debt = Short-term debt + Long-term debt

# Table IV Fama-MacBeth Annual Stock Return Regressions: Asset and Financing Decompositions

Annual stock returns from July 1968 to June 2003 are regressed on variables obtained from a balance sheet decomposition of asset growth into an investment aspect and a financing aspect. The investment decomposition defines total assets as the sum of: (1) Cash ( $\Delta$ Cash: Compustat 1), (2) Noncash current assets ( $\Delta$ CurAsst: Compustat 4 - Compustat 1), (3) Property, plant and equipment ( $\Delta$ PPE: Compustat 8), and (4) Other assets ( $\Delta$ OthAssets:  $\Delta$ Total assets -  $\Delta$ Cash -  $\Delta$ CurAsst -  $\Delta$ PPE). The financing decomposition defines total assets as the sum of: (1) Retained earnings ( $\Delta$ RE: Compustat 36), (2) Stock ( $\Delta$ Stock: Compustat 130 + Compustat 60 + Compustat 38 - Compustat 36), (3) Debt ( $\Delta$ Debt: Compustat 9 + Compustat 34), and (4) Operating liabilities ( $\Delta$ OpLiab:  $\Delta$ Total assets -  $\Delta$ RE -  $\Delta$ Stock -  $\Delta$ Debt). Variables used in the cross-sectional regressions are changes in these variables from the fiscal year ending in calendar year  $t-2$  to the fiscal year ending in calendar year  $t-1$  scaled by total assets in the fiscal year ending in calendar year  $t-2$ . Size groups are defined by ranking firms into one of three groups (small, medium, and large) using the  $30^{\text{th}}$  and  $70^{\text{th}}$  NYSE market equity percentiles in June of year  $t$ . Panel A reports regressions for all firms, and Panels B, C, and D report regressions for small, medium, and large firms, respectively. Beta estimates are time-series averages of cross-sectional regression betas obtained from annual cross-sectional regressions.  $t$ -statistics, in parentheses, are adjusted for autocorrelation in the beta estimates.

How do these results differ from those for all firms?

# Risk or mispricing?
- Three factor Fama-French results show that the asset growth effect is not captured by size and value effects.
- The paper also shows that high asset growth firms experience negative earnings surprises around future quarterly earnings announcements.
- Suggests investors are too optimistic about the future earnings of these firms and are disappointed when they see the actuals.

# Questions and interpretation
- Firms with high working capital accruals underperform.
- Firms with high asset growth, capital expenditures, growth in invested capital underperform.
- The hypothesis behind working capital accruals is about investors not understanding quality of earnings and not paying sufficient attention to cash flows.
- Why do firms with high asset growth underperform? Is it because managers overinvest anticipating high future sales that do not materialize?
- Is it because investors become overoptimistic about the future prospects of firms that are on an investment spree? Another manifestation of the extrapolation bias?
- If equity investors do not pay sufficient attention to the difference between earnings and cash flows what about corporate bond investors? Do they understand the difference?

# Accruals, asset growth, and corporate bond returns

Bhojraj and Swaminathan (2009) examine the relationship between accruals and corporate bond returns:

- Debt is serviced from cash flows not earnings; hence earnings quality and cash flow analysis should be even more important to corporate bond investors.
- The corporate bond market tends to be dominated by institutional investors compared to the stock market which has more individual investors.
- Stocks and bonds are both contingent claims on the same underlying cash flows and firm value. Common cash flow information is relevant for the valuation of both securities.
- Since institutional investors are likely to be more sophisticated than individual investors, perhaps the corporate bond market processes cash flow information more efficiently than the stock market.

# Two questions
- Does the corporate bond market price earnings quality/cash flow information more efficiently than the stock market?
- Specifically, is there an accrual effect in the corporate bond market? Is there less earnings fixation?

The sample of firms used in this study represents larger firms because they are all rated by Moody's or S&P 500.

If there are multiple bond issues outstanding per firm, the bond return for the firm is value-weighted average of the individual bond returns based on the market value of each outstanding bond issue.

Since bonds are less volatile than stocks, we cannot just compare return spreads; we will have to compare them on an equivalent volatility basis.

Sharpe Ratios provide a comparison on a volatility adjusted basis.

This table summarizes ratings and duration adjusted corporate bond returns of investment and accrual portfolios using bond market returns for the full sample (as in Table 3) from January 1973 to February 1997. Portfolios are formed and the returns are defined as in Table 3. The raw returns are adjusted for bond rating and maturity as follows. First, all available bonds (including those that belong to firms for which accruals and net new investments data are not available) are sorted into three rating categories—AAA/AA, A and BBB and below BBB. Next, the firms are sorted in to three duration categories. We then subtract from each bond's return the return of the rating-duration portfolio to which the bond belongs to compute risk-adjusted bond return. The risk-adjusted bond returns of each firm are then value-weighted to compute the benchmark-adjusted bond return for each firm. These returns are the used to compute portfolio returns over the next four quarters and next three years as presented below.  $\mathrm{Qtr} = 1$ , 2, 3, and 4 are the next four quarter returns. The numbers in parentheses are Newey-West & Hansen-Hodrick auto-correlation corrected  $t$ -statistics. The number of lags used in the autocorrelation correction is two for quarterly returns and 11 for annual returns

- The relevant risks for corporate bond are default risk and maturity risk.
- Match each corporate bond to a benchmark portfolio of bonds with similar ratings and duration and compute risk-adjusted return as the bond return minus the matching portfolio return. Risk adjusted results mirror the raw results in Table 2.
- Results suggest that the corporate bond market also misprices information in accruals about earnings quality and is fixated on earnings. Why?

# External Financing

$$
F C F F (t) = N O P A T (t) - I (t)
$$

If free cash flows  $>0$ , then the firm can return capital to its investors through dividends, stock buybacks and debt retirements. If free cash flows  $< 0$ , then the firm uses external financing to fund its net new investments.

The external financing consists of debt issues and equity issues.

# Pecking order financing
- There is an adverse selection argument against raising external capital (Myers and Majluf, 1984).
- Firms will issue external equity or debt only when their equity or debt is overvalued.
- If investors cannot distinguish between good firms and bad firms when they come to the market to issue equity, they will assign an average value to all firms that issue equity.
- This average value is too low for good firms and high for bad firms. So good firms who do not want to dilute their equity will stay out and the only firms that come to the market are bad firms.
- Therefore their prices will drop when the issue external equity or debt. Data supports this hypothesis.
- Therefore, good firms will prefer internal funds to external financing.

# Long term returns after external equity financing

Firms that issue equity underperform in the long-run. There is evidence of long-term underperformance after IPOs and SEOs (Loughran and Ritter, 1995).

Pontiff and Woodgate (2008) use growth in shares outstanding to study the effects of external equity financing.

Annual growth in shares (adjusted for stock splits) can be computed based on the shares outstanding reported by a company.

If growth in shares is positive this implies the company is issuing equity.

If growth in shares is negative, this implies the company is repurchasing stock.

Since managers tend to issue shares when their stock is overvalued and buyback shares when their stock is undervalued positive growth in shares should lead to negative stock returns in the future and negative growth in shares should lead to positive stock returns in the future.

Table III of Pontiff and Woodgate (2008).

There was much less stock issuance activity and no predictability in the pre-1970 period (Table VI). Why?

How is this related to our discussion on stock mergers?

# What is the relation between asset growth and external financing?
- Firms whose assets grow due to net new investments are the ones who might need external financing.
- Are the asset growth effect and the external financing effect two sides of the same coin?
- In other words, is the underperformance of high asset growth firms and firms that issue equity and debt essentially the same effect since these firms are one and the same? See also Table 4D of Cooper, Gulen and Schill (2008).
- Pontiff and Woodgate (2008) also show that their results are not driven by the underperformance following stock mergers.
- Overall the results suggest that high accruals, high asset growth, and high external financing are all bearish signals for individual stocks.
- Are there firms for which high asset growth and external financing might not be negative signals? How would you ascertain that? What additional information about the firm you might need to determine this?
- How would you use this in your final valuation project?
