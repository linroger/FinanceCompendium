# Errors and questionable judgments in analysts' DCF models

Abstract We investigate the number of and reasons for errors and questionable judgments that sell-side equity analysts make in constructing and executing discounted cash flow (DCF) equity valuation models. For a sample of 120 DCF models detailed in reports issued by U.S. brokers in 2012 and 2013, we estimate that analysts make a median of three theory-related and/or execution errors and four questionable economic judgments per DCF. Recalculating analysts' DCFs after correcting for major errors changes analysts' mean valuations and target prices by between  $-2$  and  $14\%$  per error. Based on face-to-face interviews with analysts and those who oversee them, we conclude that analysts' DCF modeling behavior is semi-sophisticated in the sense that analysts genuinely make mistakes regarding certain aspects of correctly valuing equity but also respond rationally to the incentives they face, particularly the reality that they are not directly compensated for being textbook DCF correct.

# 1 Introduction

Sell-side equity analysts are often seen by academics and investors as being highly sophisticated economic agents—smart, knowledgeable, and incentivized to analyze and predict the levels and risks of the cash flows, values, and stock prices of the firms they follow. However, some recent work on analysts' stock recommendations, earnings forecasts, target prices, and cash flow forecasts has challenged this view (Bradshaw 2011; Bradshaw et al. 2012; Dechow and You 2013; Call et al. 2013).

In this paper, we contribute to the literature on analyst sophistication by measuring the degree to which the discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation models that sell-side equity analysts at times include in their written reports to investors contain errors and questionable judgments and by proposing a semi-sophisticated-analyst explanation for our findings. Of the formal valuation methods available to analysts—DCF, dividend discount, and residual income—we focus on DCF because it is invariably taught to analysts in their undergraduate, MBA, or CFA training and is the theoretically based approach that is most commonly used by analysts and other Wall Street professionals. Unlike multiples methods, DCF is also rigorously equivalent to the dividend discount model and is practically well suited to independently replicable academic analysis because of its detailed and widely agreed-upon valuation structure.

Our approach is to analyze a stratified random sample of 120 sell-side analyst reports, each of which contains a DCF model and was issued in 2012 or 2013 by a U.S. brokerage. After setting out a stylized template of the data and formulae that we define based on Lundholm and Sloan's  $eVal$  methodology to be the correct way to construct and execute a DCF, we grade analysts' DCFs.

Upon tallying the grades, we estimate that in our sample analysts make a median of three theory-related or execution errors and four questionable economic judgments per DCF. Examples of errors include using materially too large or too small of a risk-free rate relative to the observable yield curve, assuming an extreme growth rate in free cash flows (FCFs) beyond the terminal year, failing to apply a mid-year adjustment factor to yearly FCFs, and not scaling up the estimated equity value from the valuation date to the target price date. Examples of questionable judgments are setting the terminal year 4 years or less from the report date, assuming an equity weight greater than  $20\%$  away from that implied by the DCF equity value, and forecasting a terminal year ROE that is less than  $5\%$  or greater than  $25\%$ .

Since in our sample there is an almost one-to-one relation between analysts' DCF valuations and target prices, we appraise the economic materiality of these results by recalculating analysts' target prices after individually correcting on an all-else-held-equal basis for each of five conceptually important errors. We find that doing so changes the mean annualized expected return (AER) in analysts' target prices by  $-2$  to  $14\%$  per error, making already optimistic target prices even more optimistic.

The largest corrections are for risk-free rates that are too high (a  $14\%$  increase in AER), using end-of-year rather than mid-year discounting (a  $5\%$  increase in AER), and not scaling up equity value from the valuation date to the target price date (a  $12\%$  increase in AER). We propose that the downward bias in target prices due to these errors either deliberately or unconsciously allows analysts to be upward biased in their forecasted future free cash flows.

Given our small sample size, we seek to understand why analysts' DCF valuations contain errors and questionable judgments by undertaking confidential interviews with senior analysts and managing directors at two top-tier U.S. investment banks, where we presented our basic results and solicited reactions, assessments, and explanations. The synthesis of what was shared with us is that DCF errors and questionable judgments occur for reasons that are consistent with a semi-sophisticated view of analyst behavior. On the one hand, managing directors who oversee analysts indicated that, in their view, analysts often do not understand key aspects of how to correctly construct and execute a DCF and, at times, embrace economically implausible beliefs about risk-free interest rates or feasible long-run economic rates of return. On the other hand, the managing directors also emphasized that many analysts may be rationally choosing not to invest the requisite amount of time, effort, and concentration needed to construct DCF valuations that are free of errors and questionable judgments because their compensation rarely directly depends on the correctness or sophistication of their DCF valuations. Analysts also confirmed to us that at times they knowingly diverge from a textbook-perfect approach, particularly with regard to their judgments about key DCF model parameters, in order to support a particular view of the firm they are reporting on.

We offer additional evidence in support of the semi-sophisticated view of analysts' DCF modeling by studying the properties of major components of their long-term financial statement forecasts, particularly in the terminal year and in perpetuity beyond it. In this area, we find that analysts on average correctly understand that, as they forecast out toward the terminal year, initially high rates of growth in the firm's revenues, EBIT, depreciation, working capital, CAPEX, and FCFs should in expectation decline, and that the firm's effective tax rate should in expectation tend toward the combined stated federal and state tax rate. However, we also observe that most analysts are optimistic in that the median rates of growth they forecast to occur in the terminal year are often larger than those that could be justified from an economic perspective. One consequence of this optimism is that analysts' return-on-investment (ROE) forecasts increase toward the terminal year in their models, rising to an economically improbable mean of almost  $20\%$  in the terminal year itself.

Overall, our interview-based evidence leads us to conclude that sell-side equity analysts construct and execute the DCF valuations they include in their reports in a semi-sophisticated manner that reflects not only their genuine errors and questionable judgments but also their rational responses to incentives, because their compensation is rarely directly tied to how much their DCFs are textbook correct.

Beyond the literature on analyst sophistication, our study contributes to three other lines of research. First, by directly studying the detailed contents of analysts' disclosed DCF models, we add to what is known about how equity analysts transform their financial statement forecasts and discount rate assumptions into projected future stock prices (Bandyopadhyay et al. 1995; Block 1999; Bradshaw 2002, 2004; Demirakos et al. 2004; Markou and Taylor 2014). In doing so, our paper responds to the calls made by Schipper (1991), Brown (1993), Rarnath et al. (2008), Bradshaw (2011), and Groysberg and Healy (2013) that researchers look inside the black box of sell-side analysts and illuminate their decisions.

We also add a new dimension to the literature on implementing equity valuation models. Some prior work has heartily debated how and why large-sample implementations of free cash flow, residual income, and dividend discount models at times yield very different results, even though all the models are theoretically isomorphic to the underlying principle of the present value of expected future dividends and should therefore yield the same output equity value given the same inputs (Penman and Sougiannis 1998; Francis et al. 2000; Lundholm and O'Keefe 2001a, b; Penman 2001). We contribute by highlighting the importance of users correctly implementing their DCF model, separate from and holding constant the raw data they input.

Lastly, we add to the literature on asset pricing. While asset pricing is key to much of finance and DCF valuation is key to many aspects of asset pricing, the evidence on whether analysts correctly implement DCF methods and, if not, which types of errors and questionable judgments they make, why they make them, and how economically material are their deviations is anecdotal. Our paper seeks to adopt a more standard academic approach to evaluating the sophistication with which analysts construct and execute DCF equity valuation models in that we use a stratified, random, and recent sample, together with delineated grading criteria. Since we recognize that the criteria we apply involve judgments, we seek to carefully lay out our grading criteria in the paper.

The remainder of our paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we present our sample selection procedure and provide descriptive statistics on the brokers, analysts, and firms in the sampled reports. In Sect. 3, we detail how we grade analysts' DCF valuation models and report what we estimate is present in those valuations in terms of graded errors and questionable judgments. In Sect. 4, we estimate the effects of correcting for five major errors on the annualized expected returns embedded in analysts' target prices. Then in Sect. 5, we describe our confidential interviews with experienced analysts and managing directors at two top-tier U.S. investment banks that lead us to conclude that analysts construct and execute the DCF models they include in their reports in a semi-sophisticated manner. In Sect. 6, we present the results of additional analyses that support our semi-sophisticated view of analysts by studying how well the financial statement

2 For example, Tham and Velez-Pareja (2004) list nine errors they propose users might make in DCF models but provide no evidence on how empirically common or important the mistakes are. Mauboussin (2006, pp. 2, 5) details a "list of the most frequent [8] errors we see in DCF models" identified from "various sell-side reports" but does not report sample statistics nor the economic significance of the errors. Petersen and Plenberg (2009) study three general and nonpublic valuation spreadsheets they obtained from Danish brokers. Fernandez (2013) classifies 119 types of errors in corporate valuations performed by financial analysts, investment banks, and financial consultants.

forecasts that underlie key parts of analysts' DCF models reflect the economic forces that affect firms' expected long-run business performance. We conclude in Sect. 7 and present examples of questions that we believe our findings raise for future research and the teaching of equity valuation.

# 2 Sell-side equity analyst reports that contain a DCF equity valuation model

# 2.1 Sample selection

Table 1 lays out the criteria we used to obtain our time-intensive and hand-collected sample of 120 DCF-based sell-side equity analyst reports. Since the contents of analysts' DCF models are not available in any machine readable database that we are aware of, we searched Investext to identify analyst reports in the 2-year window 2012-2013 that contained the keywords "DCF" or "discounted cash flow*" in their table of contents (panel A). We then retained only those reports that were for companies and for the United States and that were provided by brokers. From the resulting set of 9442 analyst reports, we selected five at random from each of the 24 months ending December 2013. After inspecting each report, we determined that a few did not contain sufficient DCF information or the right kind of DCF information to be useful (panel B). After randomly choosing replacements for such excluded reports, we arrived at 120 DCF-based sell-side equity analyst reports spread evenly by month January 2012 through December 2013.

We seek to assess the representativeness of our sample of 120 DCF models to the population of DCF models created by sell-side equity analysts through first noting that our broadening of the Investext search by replacing the strong restriction that the keywords "DCF" or "discounted cash flow*" be in the table of contents to the weaker restriction that the same keywords have only to be in the text yields 98,556 analyst reports. Untabulated inspection of a random sample of these indicates that recognizable DCF models are present approximately  $10\%$  of the time, with the remaining  $90\%$  of reports that contain the keywords "DCF" or "discounted cash flow*" using the terms in non-DCF model settings. We conclude that our requirement that our chosen keywords appear in the table of contents rather than the text does not create a sample selection bias.

We also note that imposing no restrictions on what must be present in the text yields 374,247 analyst reports for the period 2012-2013. On the one hand, this means that only  $2.5\%$  ( $= 9442 - 374,247$ ) of analyst reports in Investext in 2012-2013 contain an explicitly described DCF valuation model. On the other hand, the small  $2.5\%$  figure belies the large number of analyst reports that the  $2.5\%$  represents—namely 9442 in a 2-year period—and does not take into account the

We also propose that a case can be made that, if analysts are more likely to disclose their DCF models when their DCF modeling skills are greater, then the frequency and economic importance

of the DCF errors and questionable judgments that we document is a lower bound on what is present in the full population of the DCF models created by all sell-side equity analysts. $^4$

In panel C of Table 1, we report the frequency with which each of seven types of DCF models occurs in our sample of 120 reports. Of DCF models, 109 are built around estimating the cash flows to all investors, with just three directly focused on cash flows to equity investors. In nine reports, we judged there to be too little information to readily classify the DCF model. Within the DCF-to-all-investors category of models, over half employ the workhorse NOPAT approach that is commonly taught in MBA finance classes. In the NOPAT approach, forecasted FCFs are arrived at by forecasting net operating profit after adjusted taxes, adding both forecasted depreciation and the forecasted change in working capital, and subtracting forecasted capital expenditures.

# 2.2 Descriptive statistics on brokers, analysts, and firms

In Table 2, we provide descriptive statistics for the brokers, analysts, and firms in our sample of 120 DCF-based equity analyst reports. Panel A shows that the reports come from a wide range of brokers, 37 in all, with the largest numbers coming from prominent and well-known brokers. Panel B indicates that the reports are authored or coauthored by 180 different analysts, of whom 60 hold a CFA and eight have a doctorate. Of reports,  $90\%$  are updates rather than initiations, and the average number of pages in a report is 14.5. Lastly, panel C shows that the firms in the reports are widely spread across 26 of the 48 Fama-French industries, range greatly in market cap (between \$5 million and \$238 billion) and, at the report date, have been publicly traded between zero and 88 years.

# 3.2 Definition of a correctly structured and executed DCF-to-all-investors equity valuation

In Fig. 2, $^{5,6}$  we lay out what we define to be a correctly structured and executed DCF-to-all-investors equity valuation model, where we define the target price to be the equity value per share (EQVALPS) at the analyst valuation date scaled up by the firm's cost of equity to the target price date. We refer to Fig. 2 as our condensed DCF model, and it is the model that is commonly taught in undergraduate and MBA classes and in in-house broker training courses. We emphasize that what we lay out in the condensed DCF model is not  $100\%$  correct in that it differs in certain ways from what we do take to be  $100\%$  correct, namely the DCF-to-all-investors equity

5 The DCF-to-all-investors equity valuation model in Fig. 2 is stylized in that it is a condensed version of what we assume to be  $100\%$  correct, namely the DCF-to-all-investors valuation model detailed by Lundholm and Sloan in their book Equity Valuation and Analysis with eVal ( $3^{rd}$  edition, 2013, especially pp. 154-155; p. 225; pp. 239-243). We adopt a less than fully correct DCF valuation model against which to grade analysts for two main reasons. First, most of the differences detailed here are likely to occur infrequently and to be economically small. Second, it is rare for analysts to include the items represented by these differences in their models, and we wish to avoid biasing our study in favor of concluding that analysts construct and execute DCF valuation models in an unsophisticated manner. Thus, if analysts are aware of the differences but rationally choose to exclude them because they are infrequent and immaterial, then we would risk biasing our assessment of analyst sophistication toward concluding that analysts are unsophisticated if we include the differences in our grading template. Conversely, if analysts are not aware that the differences exist but we grade analysts under the presumption that they should be aware, then we would risk concluding that analysts are unsophisticated based on a large number of economically small aspects of DCF modeling and execution rather than on economically or theoretically important errors.

6 The differences that we itemize between our stylized model and that of Lundholm and Sloan are as follows. We explicate the differences because if an analyst's DCF model does not conform to Lundholm and Sloan's assumed  $100\%$  correct model but does conform to our reduced model, we do not grade the analyst as having made an error or questionable judgment.

- We do not include a line for the change in deferred taxes after taxes on EBIT. Some analysts address the deferred tax effect of the line taxes on EBIT by forecasting cash taxes on EBIT instead of (book) taxes on EBIT.
- We do not include lines for non-operating income (loss) or extraordinary items & discontinued operations after the depreciation & amortization add-back line after NOPAT.
- We do not include lines for increase in investments, purchase of intangibles, increase in other assets, increase in other liabilities, or clean surplus plug after the CAPEX line.
- We do not include the cost of preferred stock or the cost of minority interest in calculating WACC.
- We do not mark the firm's financial assets and liabilities to their market values.
- We ignore company warrants and ascribe no value to the conversion options embedded in convertible bonds.
- We address the contingent equity claim of employee stock options by (leniently) only grading the analyst as having made an error if the analyst arrived at the equity value per share by dividing the dollar equity value of the firm by outstanding common shares, and then only if the difference between basic and fully diluted common shares as of the most recent fiscal period before the report date exceeded  $3\%$  of common shares outstanding.
- We do not include information about year  $T + 1$  in Fig. 2, even though a  $100\%$  correct DCF model should show year  $T + 1$  to prove out to the reader that steady state has been achieved (Levin and Olsson 2000; Lundholm and Sloan 2013). We do not grade analysts as having made an error if they do not show year  $T + 1$  data, although we do grade them with regard to the economic plausibility of the implied rates of growth in key financial statement variables and ratios in year  $T$ .

valuation model detailed by Lundholm and Sloan in their textbook Equity Valuation and Analysis with  $e$  Val. We detail the differences in the notes to Fig. 2. We adopt a less than fully correct DCF valuation model against which to grade analysts because most of the differences (as detailed in the notes to Fig. 2) are in expectation likely to occur infrequently and be economically small. Also, since it is rare for analysts to include the items represented by these differences in their models, we wish to avoid grading analysts overly harshly by putting minor errors on par with more economically substantive errors.

# 3.3 Descriptive statistics on key components of analysts' DCF valuation models

Before grading analysts' DCF models, we entered the data underlying the DCF models into Excel templates similarly laid out to those shown in Fig. 2. Although not all analysts follow the DCF-to-all-investors approach, where a different approach is used we conform the information provided by the analyst into the template laid out in Fig. 2. We record one DCF per analyst report and place each firm's completed template on a separate tab within our Excel data file. Table 3 gives descriptive statistics on the key components of the DCF models.

In panel A of Table 3, we describe analysts' DCF equity values, target prices, target price horizons, and the annualized expected returns embedded in the target price. In panel B, we report when the terminal year occurs and the assumed postterminal year perpetual growth in annual FCFs. In panel C, we present analysts' assumptions about weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and its components, focusing on these aspects of the DCF information analysts may provide, rather than on FCFs, terminal values, the components of FCFs, enterprise value, or equity value, because the latter are all denominated in raw dollars, not in percentages, and are likely to largely reflect scale effects.

The first numerical column in each of panels A-C is  $N$ , the number of reports in which a given variable is found. The dispersion in  $N$  shows that analysts vary greatly in the quantity and kinds of DCF model information they provide in their reports. For example, while all 120 DCF-based analyst reports contain a target price (panel A), just 15 reports disclose the horizon underlying the risk-free rate that is part of WACC (panel C).

In the panels,  $N$  is the number of analyst reports that disclose the value of the data item;  $T$  is the terminal year in the analyst's DCF model; and  $g$  is the analyst's stated post-terminal year perpetuity growth rate

Panel A shows that in our sample there is an almost one-to-one correspondence between analysts' target prices and their DCF valuations. Descriptively, for the 111 analyst reports that provide both a stated analyst target price and a target price horizon, the mean (median) annualized expected return embedded in stated target prices is  $18\%$  ( $13\%$ ). Of individual expected returns,  $77\%$  are positive. The mean return of  $18\%$  compares to the  $24\%$  reported by Bradshaw et al. (2013) for U.S. firms during the period 2000-2009 and to the  $16\%$  reported by Joos et al. (2013) for Morgan Stanley reports issued 2007-2012.

Panel B reveals that WACC and its components vary widely across analysts' DCF models. The maximum WACC of  $21\%$  is five times that of the minimum WACC of  $4.5\%$ ; risk-free rate (RF) varies between 0.2 and  $5.0\%$ ; betas range between 0.55 and 2.50; the annual market risk premium varies between 4 and  $11\%$ ; and the weight on equity in calculating WACC ranges from 14 to  $100\%$ .

Panel C reports similarly diverse numbers to those in panels A and B. The postterminal year perpetual annual rates analysts explicitly assume that FCFs (and implicitly assume that all key balance sheet and income statement numbers) will grow by between  $-100$  and  $15\%$ . Likewise, the number of years in analysts' forecasts of future FCFs (including the terminal year) range from a low of 1 year to a high of 16 years, with the median analyst DCF model setting the terminal year 8 years out from the forecast date.

Based on Fig. 2, Tables 4 and 5 list the errors that we grade analysts on, both with respect to the numerator-oriented level, growth and timing of FCFs of DCF models (panel A, Table 4), and the denominator-related discount rate features of valuation (panel A, Table 5). The errors identified in Tables 4 and 5 are followed in Table 6 by the list of questionable judgments that we grade analysts on, spanning both numerator and denominator aspects of DCF. We identify errors and questionable judgments using only gradable observations, defined as observations for which there is sufficient data to determine whether a given type of error or questionable judgment has been made.[11]

We grade analysts' DCF models based on what we define to be the economically reasonable cutoff values (or range of cutoff values) for certain of the condensed DCF model elements shown in Fig. 2 and for certain of the theoretically oriented interrelationships between them. In defining what we grade to be an analyst error versus a questionable judgment, we seek to make it clear when we do and do not exert our judgment as to what is and what is not an error and what is and what is not a questionable judgment. For example, we grade an analyst as having made an error in his RF assumption if his RF is more than  $\pm 30$  bps away from the 10-year Treasury rate on the analyst report date (error type 2.1, panel A of Table 5). An example of a cutoff value for which we conclude that the analyst has made a questionable judgment is when she assumes an annual market risk premium in excess of  $9\%$  (questionable judgment type 3.2, panel A of Table 6). An example of an error based on a theory-based interrelationship between elements of the condensed DCF model is an erroneous analyst terminal value, which we define as one that is more than  $\pm 3\%$  away from the terminal value that we calculate from the analyst's terminal year free cash flow forecast, given the analyst's WACC and forecasted perpetual growth rate (error type 1.4, panel A of Table 4).

Although different types of analyst errors may be positively correlated, we seek to identify errors that are as much as possible independent of one another. We detail our justifications for the critical values and theory-based interrelationships between DCF elements that are central to Tables 4, 5 and 6 in panel B of each table. Additionally, in Appendix 1 we illustrate the specifics of our error and questionable judgment grades (along with disclosure scores that we develop and define in Appendix 2) using three different actual DCF models copied from the analyst reports in our sample. The DCF portions of the three sample reports in aggregate span six of the nine numerator-related errors listed in Table 4, 10 of the 12 denominator-related errors listed in Table 5, and 16 of the 20 questionable judgments listed in Table 6.

# 3.5 Errors in analysts' DCF valuation models

# 3.5.1 Errors pertaining to numerator-related FCF forecasts in analysts' DCF models

In panel A of Table 4, we catalog the nine errors on which we grade analysts with regard to the numerator-oriented level, growth, and timing of FCF aspects of their DCF models. The errors range from incorrectly deriving FCFs from underlying financial statement forecasts, to adding total rather than just non-operating cash to enterprise value, to using the incorrect number of fully diluted shares. We define the error rate of a given type of error as the number of reports containing the error divided by the number of reports containing sufficient data for us to determine whether the error had been made. Since  $N$  is rarely equal to 120, the number of analyst reports in our sample, when we state that "we estimate that analysts make a given error  $Z\%$  of the time," we intend this to pertain to the population of all analyst reports that satisfy our sample selection criteria laid out in Table 1. This means that we also assume that the decision by an analyst to report the information we need to determine whether an error has been made is uncorrelated with the probability that the analyst has made an error.

The most common errors that we estimate analysts make about the numerator aspects of their DCF models are incorrectly calculating their terminal value (error type 1.4), incorrectly calculating enterprise value (error type 1.5), and incorrectly calculating equity value given the adjustments that are required to enterprise value (error type 1.6.1). We estimate that analysts make these mistakes 25, 26, and  $31\%$  of the time, respectively. Among the least common errors analysts make are incorrectly calculating EQUALPS given the numerator and denominator components of the calculation (error type 1.6.2, which we estimate happens just  $4\%$  of the time) and overestimating the perpetual growth rate in FCFs beyond the terminal year (error type 1.3). Based on our maximum plausible terminal growth rate of  $5\%$  per year, we estimate that only  $7\%$  of analysts make an erroneously high assumption for the perpetuity rate of growth in FCFs.[12] Overall, we observe that the mean and median rates of error across all nine categories of gradable errors listed in panel A of Table 4 are 16 and  $15\%$ , respectively.

12 We view  $5\%$  as conservative in grading errors for the projected rate of growth in post-terminal year free cash flows because  $5\%$  is  $2\%$  larger than the value assumed by Lundholm and Sloan in Equity Valuation and Analysis with eVal (2013,  $3^{\text{rd}}$  ed., p. 174), the source of our assumed  $100\%$  correctly structured and executed DCF-to-all-investors equity valuation model. Lundholm and Sloan state that they use  $3\%$  as the default terminal value for sales growth (and therefore free cash flows also). Their reasoning is that "[h]istorically, the annual growth rate in the U.S. economy, as measured by the nominal GDP growth rate, has averaged around  $6\%$ , composed of roughly  $4\%$  real growth and  $2\%$  price inflation. However, the financial crisis of 2007-2008 sent both real growth and inflation plummeting into negative territory, albeit briefly. The long-term forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve at the end of 2010 put real growth at  $2 - 3\%$  and inflation at  $1 - 2\%$ . So, in most cases a terminal sales growth rate forecast should fall between 3 and  $5\%$  … We use  $3\%$  as the default terminal value for Sales Growth in eVal." Also, our sample of analyst reports is from 2012-2013, very close in time to 2010. If we use Lundholm and Sloan's cutoff of  $3\%$ , then we estimate a much larger analyst error rate of  $32\%$ .

# 3.5.2 Errors pertaining to denominator-related discount rates in analysts' DCF models

In Table 5, we catalog the 12 errors that we propose analysts may make with regard to the denominator-related discount rate aspects of valuation. The errors include assuming that the before-tax cost of debt is zero, using an equity weight in calculating WACC that is inconsistent with the equity value obtained from the analyst's actual DCF valuation, and several types of incorrect discounting of future FCFs (including not discounting them at all). Overall, we observe that the mean and median rates of error across the 12 categories of gradable errors listed in panel B of Table 5 are 33 and  $19\%$ , respectively.

The most common error analysts make in discounting is not scaling up their estimated equity value from the valuation date to the target price date (error type 2.8). We estimate that this error occurs  $93\%$  of the time. The least common error is assigning no weight to preferred stock in calculating WACC, even though the firm's financial statements show that the firm has preferred stock (error type 2.3.4). We estimate that analysts make this error just  $3\%$  of the time, likely because it is uncommon for firms to have preferred stock.

We also highlight three errors that we propose can exert an economically large effect on the analyst's estimate of equity value: (1) the already mentioned error of not scaling up estimated equity value from the valuation date to the target price date (error type 2.8, error rate  $= 93\%$ ), (2) using an RF that is more than  $\pm 30$  bps away from the 10-year Treasury bill yield on the date of the analyst's report (error type 2.1, error rate  $= 84\%$ ), and (3) discounting annual FCFs as if they occur at year-

Each of these errors occurs with a markedly high frequency, which we view as surprising given the attention paid to them in both academic and practitioner texts on equity valuation.

# 3.6 Questionable judgments in analysts' DCF valuation models

In Table 6, we itemize the 22 questionable judgments that we propose analysts may make in their DCF models. They include assuming an implausibly large beta, not providing the reader with any sensitivity analyses about key valuation parameters, providing little or no information about the components of WACC, and setting the date back to which forecasted future FCFs are discounted beyond the date on which they are writing their report.

The most common type of questionable judgment occurs in the area of analysts treating all of a firm's cash as a financial asset, rather than estimating some portion of the cash to be operating in nature (questionable judgment type 3.10.1). We estimate that this questionable judgment happens in  $95\%$  of gradable reports.[13] Another common type of questionable judgment occurs in the area of the net financial asset/liability adjustments analysts make to enterprise value to arrive at equity value (questionable judgment type 3.10.2), where we estimate that the gradable questionable judgment rate is  $54\%$ .[14] We also note three types of questionable judgments that can be economically significant. First, we estimate that  $18\%$  of analysts employ an excessively large market risk premium, defined as one greater than  $9\%$  (questionable judgment type 3.2). Second,  $42\%$  of analysts set the valuation date beyond the date of their report (questionable judgment type 3.11.1). Third, in  $26\%$  of analysts' DCF models, the ROE embedded in forecasts of terminal year financial statements (that typically but not always accompany analysts' DCF models) is less than  $5\%$  or greater than  $25\%$ , both of which we assume are economically improbable (questionable judgment type 3.7). Fourth, analysts forecast that revenue or free cash flow growth in the terminal year will exceed  $10\%$  approximately 24 and  $37\%$  of the time, respectively (questionable judgment types 3.12.1 and 3.12.6). Overall we note that questionable judgments are not uncommon in that, per Table 6, the mean and median rates at which they occur are 23 and  $16\%$ , respectively.

# 3.7 Errors and questionable judgments aggregated within and across analysts

Having described the errors and questionable judgments on which we grade individual analysts in their DCF equity valuation models, as well as the absolute and relative frequencies with which we estimate each occurs for individual analysts, we turn to aggregating errors and questionable judgments within and across analysts and by broker. The results are reported in Table 7.

Table 7 panel A shows that, in our sample of 120 broker reports issued between Jan. 2012 and Dec. 2013, the estimated median (mean) number of errors made per DCF is three (3.6) and the estimated median (mean) number of questionable judgments made per DCF is four (4.5). When scaled by the number of errors and questionable judgments for which analysts provide sufficient data to be graded, we estimate that analysts' median (mean) error rate is  $25\%$  ( $28\%$ ) and their median (mean) questionable judgment rate is  $29\%$  ( $29\%$ ). Panel B lists the mean number of errors and questionable judgments and the mean error and questionable judgment rates by broker. The data suggest that the valuation models in the sell-side analyst reports published by larger brokers contain similar numbers and rates of errors and questionable judgments to those of smaller brokers.

# 4 Economic magnitude of analysts' DCF valuation errors

It could be the case that DCF errors and questionable judgments are plentiful but economically unimportant. Given the almost one-to-one correspondence between analysts' DCF valuations and target prices in our sample, we therefore seek to measure the economic significance of our results by recalculating analysts' stated target prices and the AERs embedded in them after correcting for each of five major types of errors, holding all other aspects of analysts' valuations constant. We estimate that doing so changes the mean AER in analysts' target prices by between  $-2$  and  $14\%$  per error, which we conclude to be economically material magnitudes.

The errors we correct for are those where (1) the analyst's post-terminal year growth rate in FCFs  $g$  exceeds  $5\%$ , (2) the analyst incorrectly includes FCFs that occurred before the valuation date or makes incorrect adjustments to ENTVAL in arriving at EQVAL, (3) the analyst's RF is more than  $\pm 30$  bps away from the 10-year Treasury bill yield on analyst's report date, (4) the analyst's FCFs are discounted end-of-year and not mid-year, and (5) the analyst does not scale up EQVALPS from the valuation date to the target date. We focus on these errors because, based on the formulae underlying DCF valuation, we judge them to be the most likely to yield material changes in analysts' target prices when corrected.

Table 8 reports the results of correcting each error in a mutually exclusive manner. In measuring the average effects of correcting a given error, we include both observations where we can identify that analysts have made an error and those where they have not. For example, in correcting analysts' errors about  $g$ , the postterminal year growth rate in FCFs, we take the 109 analyst reports that per panel B of Table 3 disclose  $g$  and recalculate the analyst's target price after reducing to  $5\%$  all values of  $g > 5\%$ . This turns out to be feasible for 57 of the initial 109 observations.

We estimate that correcting errors (1) and (2) yields no materially positive or negative material changes in the AERs implied by corrected target prices. In contrast, correcting error (4) increases AERs by a mean and median of  $5\%$  (that is, about half the mean value of the cost of equity [RE] reported in panel C of Table 3), while the largest impacts on AERs come from correcting errors (3) and (5). Thus we estimate that changing RF to the 10-year Treasury yield on the analyst report date when RF is more than  $\pm 30$  bps away from that 10-year Treasury yield increases AERs by a mean (median) of  $14\%$  ( $21\%$ ). We also estimate that scaling up EQVALPS from the valuation date to the target price date for the  $93\%$  of the time that this is not done by the analyst increases AERs by a mean (median) of  $12\%$  ( $11\%$ ).

We also note that the results in Table 8 can be viewed as indicating that analysts' price forecasts are even more optimistic than target price studies such as Bradshaw et al. (2013) and Joos et al. (2013) have found them to be. This is because what we argue is the correct translation of the fundamental FCF and WACC information that analysts place into their DCF valuation models yields—all else held constant—estimates of the relevant firms' future stock prices that are materially higher than those obtained from analysts' stated target prices. However, we propose that such a view would warrant tempering by the likelihood that all else would not be held constant. That is, were analysts made aware of the errors listed in Table 8 or if they were already strategically aware of the errors but were forced to not make them, then they might be likely to revise downward their fundamental FCF forecasts, increase their WACCs, or both to compensate for the otherwise large upward increase in their valuations that would occur. Alternatively, analysts might not view their errors as material in the overall context of their reports, in which case they might leave their FCF forecasts and WACCs unchanged.

# 5 Why do analysts make errors and questionable judgments in their DCF valuations?

In this section, we seek to understand why sell-side equity analysts construct and execute their DCF valuations in a way that, based on our grading criteria, results in the estimated median of three errors and four questionable judgments that are present per DCF. We conclude that the evidence we gather supports the view that analysts are "semi-sophisticated" in that they imperfectly construct and execute their DCF valuations for reasons that reflect true misunderstandings of particular aspects of how to correctly value equity and also their rational responses to their economic incentives, particularly with regard to compensation. We now turn to describe each of the methods we employ in generating the evidence.

# 5.1 Interviews with analysts

The main approach we have pursued in seeking to understand why sell-side equity analysts make a seemingly large number of errors and questionable judgments in their DCF valuations is directly talking to and hearing from analysts and the managing directors who oversee them.[15] The strength of this approach is that, to the extent that analysts consciously diverge from what they know to be the correct DCF method and nonquestionable judgments, they can directly tell researchers what is really going on in their DCF models and why they are diverging from the correct approach, making questionable judgments, or both. The weaknesses are that analysts need to know what the correct DCF method is, need to be willing to tell researchers where they are diverging from it and why, and need to be willing and able to communicate their knowledge in a full, unbiased, and truthful manner.

With such advantages and limitations in mind, we undertook five sets of confidential interviews with experienced current and former sell-side equity analysts and the executive and managing directors who oversee them at two top-tier U.S. investment banks that we refer to as investment bank A and investment bank B.[16] Three face-to-face interviews lasted an hour each, a fourth face-to-face interview lasted  $40\mathrm{min}$ , and one interview was conducted via email. In each interview, one of the authors presented the essence of the results in Tables 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and asked those in attendance for their reactions. The interviews lead us to conclude that errors and questionable judgments occur in analysts' DCF models for multiple reasons that overall support a semi-sophisticated view of analysts' DCF modeling.

# 5.1.1 Analysts' misunderstandings of how to correctly value equity

Among the explanations highlighted to us by managing directors in the interviews were that analysts often do not understand key aspects of how to correctly value equity and often unwittingly or inflexibly embrace implausible beliefs about market-set prices such as risk-free interest rates or feasible long-run economic rates of return. One managing director stated that, with regard to not scaling up valuations to the target date, "Not doing it is just a mistake, period." Another interviewee, who had been an analyst and was now an managing director overseeing analyst teams stated, "Not using half-year discounting, not scaling up from the valuation date to the target price date, those are definitely errors and failures of understanding by analysts…. These things are quite often wrong, yes" and that "what you find on perpetuity growth rates and excessive ROEs I think happens because analysts often just don't believe in the statistical reality of long-run economics."[17]

Both analysts and managing directors also told us that they think that some errors occur because analysts tend to build their own models: "All our models are homegrown, created from scratch. I think that errors tend to compound over time because the original [model] was built ages ago, and we don't often go back and recheck our models" (analyst from investment bank B). As to why such errors persist, a managing director at investment bank A said he often points out to analysts the errors they are making but that "We don't audit every DCF valuation published in every report—we do audit valuations used to establish price targets, but if DCF is not explicitly part of price target valuation, it receives less scrutiny from management." He added: "I don't have much ability to control all aspects of valuation discussion. I oversee lots of teams of analysts, all of whom are smart and free thinkers, and they're all convinced that they're right."[18]

# 5.1.2 Analysts' rational responses to the incentives provided by their compensation

Our interviewees also uniformly emphasized to us that analysts' compensation rarely explicitly depends on the correctness or sophistication of their DCF valuations. One analyst at investment bank B bluntly stated that "zero [compensation] is associated with our DCF models." Thus analysts are likely sensibly choosing to not invest enough time, effort, and mental focus to construct error-free DCF valuations. One managing director stated: "Analysts just don't have a lot of incentives to really do it [the DCF valuation] carefully following the textbook. DCF modeling doesn't allow for the voting aspect that is very big in analysts' compensation. $^{19}$  A former executive director stated: "The way things often work is that a particular team decides on a particular approach to valuation, choice of parameters, and such and sticks with that. The choices made are indeed often heuristically determined and must also satisfy the conditions that it is easy to update models and valuations and the choices can be explained to clients in a straightforward manner." To the extent that they do face pressure to construct textbook-correct DCFs, those we interviewed suggested that it is at best indirect: "Although it doesn't happen very often, it is embarrassing if someone calls you up and says you're wrong [in your DCF] you know" (analyst at investment bank B).

Related to the lack of focused incentives for analysts to construct textbook correct DCFs, they emphasized to us that valuation is only one part of their job and that, even in valuation, they typically use DCF to support a multiples-based valuation, rather than to originate a target price. Thus three different analysts at investment bank B stated that "DCF is just one part of the overall [analyst] job… so not surprising that the DCFs are prone to errors and bad judgments in places" and "DCF is an academic sanity check against multiples-derived valuations" and "I can tell you that while the DCF gets a  $50\%$  weight [in the valuation], it's the secondary method to support the multiple number." Corroboratively, a managing director at investment bank A said the analyst report acts much more as a "gateway into engaging with clients, and the live engagement is what clients find most valuable and thus generates the most revenues for the firm," adding that "although investors are skeptical of DCF, the DCF model is often there because it forces us to think about our business assumptions about the firm we're covering and, through discussing those assumptions and views in the report, enables us to engage with our clients in intelligent conversation and debate about their assumptions." The DCF model becomes a "cornerstone for intelligent conversation." A client can then talk to the investment bank about "help[ing] me test my assumptions and see where I might be wrong," which strengthens the relationship with the client and increases the likelihood of generating other fee-related business.[20]

# 5.1.3 Analyst effort

A logical proposition is that more analyst effort leads to fewer errors and questionable judgments. Consistent with this, one analyst at investment bank B explained that he understood this but was willing to bear the consequences because of his objective: "I've used the same models for 10 years…. I've not changed my model structure or assumptions. And I use the same discount rate for all firms, because for me it's all about relative, not absolute, valuation." Another analyst, also at investment bank B, agreed, saying "it's more important for me to be consistent [over time] than take the correct rate from the yield curve."

Consistent with our using the absolute value of the annualized expected return in the target price to be a proxy for analyst effort and finding that the proxy is reliably negatively related to the rate of DCF questionable judgments, a former executive director said: "One thing to note is that clients are not naive about these things. They know [analysts' DCF valuation] is part of a commercial story, and they will grill the analysts on obvious tricks, like changing the COE or tinkering with the terminal growth rate."

# 5.1.4 Strategic behavior by analysts

The final area on which we received feedback from analysts pertains to departures from strictly textbook-correct DCF made to support a particular valuation intuition or position held by an analyst. Those we interviewed stated that analysts do at times consciously reverse-engineer aspects of their valuations and inject questionable judgments into their models in places to support particular intuitions or views that they hold. For example, two analysts at investment bank B said, "There's a lot of flex [in reverse-engineering] on the cost of equity" and "I tend to tweak margins rather than discount rate." Similarly, a managing director at investment bank A said: "Yeah, such behavior happens. If an analyst thinks that the true target price is  $100\%$  higher than the current price, he simply can't publish a  $100\%$  higher target price, that's not really credible. So he'll publish a target price that's, say,  $30\%$  higher and support that via his DCF and then, when that price is reached in a few months, move up the target price another  $30\%$  and again support it in his DCF."

# 6 Analysts' behavior with regard to predicting long-run financial statements

Overall, our interviews lead us to conclude that analysts on average construct and execute the DCF models they include in their reports in a semi-sophisticated manner that reflects not only an imperfect understanding of correct DCF modeling but also rational responses to their economic incentives in creating and writing their reports.

In this section, we present additional evidence in support of the view that analysts are semi-sophisticated with regard to DCF modeling. Specifically, we document the properties of key components of analysts' long-term financial statement forecasts, particularly in the terminal year and in perpetuity beyond it, and show that analysts only partially recognize the economic and statistical forces that must be taken into account.

In Fig. 3, we present the trajectories of the medians of key ratios extracted from analysts' forecasted financial statements in event time relative to analysts' DCF terminal year (where available). Panel A displays the median rates of growth in certain dollar-denominated financial statement variables, while panel B reports the median values of the percentage-based ROE and the effective tax rate variables.

Fig. 3 Trajectories of key financial statement ratios in event time relative to the DCF terminal year. Ratios are derived from the forecasted financial statements, DCF equity valuation models, or both in 120 analyst reports sampled from Investext, Jan. 2012-Dec. 2013. a Median rates of growth in financial statement variables. b Median values of firms' ROE, effective tax rate (ETR), and cost of equity capital (RE). Note The number of observations from which the median values plotted above are taken range between 12 and 108. The median number of observations in any given event year is 58

Looking first at panel A, it can be readily seen that the median rates of growth in all five dollar-denominated financial statement variables on average decline as the terminal year approaches. This is consistent with analysts on average correctly recognizing the economic reality that, in the long run, high rates of projected firm growth and all its correlates must in expectation decline and converge toward a figure no larger than the expected rate of nominal growth in the world economy. Also consistent with such a view is the result in panel B, where the median effective tax rate increases as the terminal year approaches.

However, Fig. 3 also reports evidence that we view as being inconsistent with most analysts being highly sophisticated in their understanding of long-run economic forces. First, pivoting on our assumption expressed in the cutoff in error type 1.3 (Table 4, panel A) that, during our 2012-2013 sample period, the correct expected perpetual rate of annual worldwide economic growth should not exceed  $5\%$ , panel A shows that the median analyst projection of the rate of growth in long-term FCFs is more than  $5\%$ . Second, even where the median rates of projected growth in revenues, depreciation, EBIT, and CAPEX are smaller than  $5\%$ , less than but still close to  $50\%$  of individual analysts' projections exceed  $5\%$ . Taken together, the evidence in panel A leads us to conclude that close to  $50\%$  of analysts in our sample are optimistic and only partially reflect the realities of long-run economic forces in their DCF forecasts.

The evidence in panel B regarding analysts' forecasts of ROE as time increases from the forecast date toward the terminal year echoes this conclusion.[21] Specifically, panel B shows that median ROE is forecasted to increase as the terminal year approaches, rising from a linearly fitted value of  $12.5\%$  9 years before the terminal year to  $18.4\%$  in the terminal year. We put forward that this is not what would be expected to be observed in a random sample of publicly traded firms, given a mean forecasted cost of equity of  $11.1\%$  (Table 3, panel C). We interpret the gap of  $7.3\%$  between  $18.4\%$  and  $11.1\%$  as indicating that analysts on average are optimistic and lack a strong economic understanding of the plausible long-run profitability of the companies they follow.[22]

# 7 Conclusions and questions for future research

We have presented evidence that sell-side equity analysts make many errors and questionable judgments in constructing and executing their DCF equity valuation models. Using a stratified random sample of 120 analyst reports issued by U.S. brokers in 2012-2013, we estimated that the median report contains three DCF theory-related or implementation errors and four questionable judgments about inputs into their DCFs. We assessed the economic magnitude of these results by recalculating analysts' target prices after correcting for major errors and found that doing so changes mean target prices by between  $-2\%$  and  $14\%$  per error.

Using interview-based research methods, we conclude that analysts' behavior expressed in their DCF valuations corresponds most closely to the view that they are semi-sophisticated. That is, analysts, on average, appear to genuinely misunderstand certain aspects of how to value equity, and they also express economically improbable views about future interest rates, future in-perpetuity revenue and FCF growth rates, and expected rates of return. At the same time, however, some evidence indicates that analysts depart from textbook-correct DCF valuations for sensible economic reasons that reflect both the lack of explicit rewards in their compensation packages for constructing and implementing DCF models in theoretically perfect ways and their preferences to support particular intuitions they hold about the valuations of the firms in their reports.

In conclusion, we propose that our study raises a number of questions that may represent fruitful lines of enquiry for future research to pursue. For example, to what extent are users of analysts' reports such as institutional investors and corporate CFOs cognizant of analysts' errors and questionable judgments? Where and how do they discount analysts' DCF models and price targets? Do corporate CFOs make similar departures from fully correct approaches to valuing equity? Do hedge funds or other types of sophisticated investors exploit analysts' erroneously executed DCF valuations? Given the importance of valuation in accounting, economics, and finance, we believe that these questions are worthy of future research, particularly because the answers may be useful to academics and practitioners alike. We also suggest that the results of our study may be helpful to faculty who teach DCF valuation, particularly to those who teach students such as MBAs whose careers are likely to involve creating or consuming DCF valuations.

Description of disclosure quality scores calculated for 120 DCF models in analyst reports taken from Investext, Jan. 2012-Dec. 2013

Panel A: Explanation of how disclosure quality scores are computed

A. Regarding forecasted financial statements: 3 (1) points are awarded for each annual full (mini) B/S, I/S, and SCF forecasted by the analyst. The sum is then divided by  $3 \times 3 \times T$ , where  $T$  is the number of years ahead that the terminal year lies. Since  $T$  sometimes exceeds the number of years for which the analyst is forecasting future financial statements, the disclosure quality score for forecasted financial statements can exceed  $100\%$ . Also, because  $T$  may not be shown in the analyst's DCF model (e.g., the analyst simply states what WACC is and what their estimated EQVALPS is), there are some reports for which the score cannot be calculated

B. Regarding the deriving of FCF: 1 point is awarded for each of the following 10 lines that are explicitly or implicitly forecasted by the analyst in hir or her DCF-to-all-investors model: EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, EBIT, taxes on EBIT, NOPAT, depreciation and amortization (again), annual change in working capital, after-tax operating cash flows, CAPEX, and FCFs. The sum is then divided by 10. An explicit forecast occurs when the analyst writes down a number for a given line. An implicit forecast occurs when the analyst does not write down a number for a given line but the number for the given line can be deduced from other lines the analyst has explicitly forecasted

C. Regarding WACC: 1 point is awarded for each of the 11 components used in calculating WACC per panel C of Table 3. The sum is then divided by 11

D. Regarding converting FCF to EQVALPS, 1 point is awarded for each of the following 12 items when explicitly shown on the analyst's DCF: horizon year (max. of 1 point), present value (PV) of FCF in each individual year in forecast horizon (max. of 1 point), total PV of all forecasted FCFs, terminal value, PV of terminal value, enterprise value, cash, debt, equity value, shares used to deflate equity value, EQVALPS, and date to which the forecasted EQVALPS applies. The sum is then divided by 12
