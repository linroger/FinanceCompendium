# Market efficiency

What is market efficiency?

- Stock prices rapidly adjust to new information
- New information is fully reflected in prices  $\Rightarrow$  trading on this information does not offer an abnormal rate of return
- Efficiency implies that capital markets become a fair game
- Only new information should move prices  $\Rightarrow$  prices follow a random walk
- Market efficiency is a relative concept
- Defined relative to an information set
- If markets are (semi-strong form) efficient, then all publicly available information is reflected in price
- Does it make sense to conduct fundamental analysis based on publicly available information?

# Paradox of efficient markets

- When information acquisition is costly, we have a paradox
- If markets are efficient and reflect all publicly available information, then why should you engage in costly information acquisition?
- But if nobody engages in this activity, how do markets become efficient in the first place?
- Efficiency is not an equilibrium when information is costly
- There is always some mispricing
- Higher returns are compensation for costly info acquisition and financial analysis
- Hedge fund industry illustrates:
- Gains from info acquisition & analysis can be substantial
- Strong incentives to exploit or arbitrage market inefficiencies or mispricing
- Many anomalies that were identified are no longer profitable

# Role of arbitrage

- Arbitrage limits the inefficiencies in markets
- But transaction costs and institutional constraints limit arbitrage
- Arbitrage strategies may not be entirely risk-free in which case the return is partly compensation for risk
- For instance, liquidity plays an important role for arbitrage strategies and may be missing in extreme situations
- Examples showing that sophisticated strategies can have significant risks:
- Long Term Capital Management (Asian crisis)
Hedge funds and their quantitative strategies in August 2007

- Recent decline in the number of (new) hedge funds shows that the industry is very competitive

# Evidence on market efficiency

- Lots of evidence that markets are competitive (see Koller et al., Chapter 5)
- Strong link between prices and fundamentals (growth, ROIC and cost of capital), especially in the long-run
- Market's reaction to news events is almost instantaneous
- Mutual funds are generally unable to outperform indices consistently
- Pricing of financial information is quite sophisticated

Yet, there are:

- Bubbles and stock market anomalies
- Growing evidence that behavioral biases in human decision making can survive and matter in markets (see Additional Readings on Canvas)
- Answers by IGM Economic Experts Panel reflect both aspects
- Question 1: Strong consensus on (non-)predictability of stock prices
- Question 2: Majority of the panel does not think that prices during Dot Com bubble were based on fundamentals alone

# IGM Economic Experts Panel

# Question A:

Unless they have inside information, very few investors, if any, can consistently make accurate predictions about whether the price of an individual stock will rise or fall on a given day.

# Example illustrating the forces: Lazy prices

Baxter International (NYSE: BAX) is a bioscience and medical products firm headquartered in Deerfield, IL

BAX is a member of the S&P 500

02/23/2010: Baxter filed its 2009 10-K financial report with the SEC

https://www.sec.gov/archives/edgar/data/10456/000095012310015380/0000950123-10-015380-index.htm

04/23/2010: The New York Times "F.D.A Steps Up Oversight of Infusion Pumps" http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/business/24pump.html

"Federal regulators say they are moving to tighten their oversight of medical devices, including one of the most ubiquitous and problematic pieces of medical equipment — automated pumps that intravenously deliver drugs, food and other solutions to patients."

"The biggest makers of infusion pumps include Baxter Healthcare of Deerfield, Ill.; Hospira of Lake Forest, Ill.; and CareFusion of San Diego."

"Dr. Shuren said he expected that the new requirements would initially slow down the rate of the agency's approval for new pumps that manufacturers are seeking to market."

05/04/2010: The New York Times "F.D.A. Deal Leads to Recall of Infusion Pumps" http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/business/04baxter.html

"Baxter International is recalling its College infusion pumps from the American market under an agreement with federal regulators that sought to fix problems like battery failures and software errors."

"Baxter expects to record a pretax charge of  $400 million to$ 600 million in the first quarter related to the recall, the company said Monday in a statement. The company isn't otherwise revising its 2010 forecast."

From: Cohen et al. Journal of Finance 2020

# Example: Lazy prices (Cohen et al. JF 2020)

- Study analyzes changes in the text of firms' 10-K filings
- Shows that Baxter example is not an isolated case
- Investors seem to miss 10-K changes
- Strategy going long in "Non-Changers" and short in "Changers" yields alpha of  $7 \%$
- Even larger when using changes in the risk-factor discussion in the 10-K specifically
- Results are across all stocks (even large ones)
- What do you predict will happen to this result?
- Ke, Kelly and Xiu: "Predicting returns with text data"

What do we learn?

- There is a lot of relevant info in 10-K that is not necessarily processed
- Paper suggests differential "laziness"

Earnings announcements and most accounting numbers are quickly processed

Text is harder to process than numbers

- For text, there is not the same comparison with prior year

# My take

- Markets price (long-run) fundamentals
- Aggregate an enormous amount of information
- Even when stocks are priced correctly on average, there is a standard error and hence some mispricing of individual stocks at certain times
- Degree to which price reflects all publicly available information can differ across stocks and time
- Info environment of a stock matters
- Ability to arbitrage differs across stocks
- Many anomalies are concentrated in small stocks
- Also, the market seems to be particularly good at relative pricing
- But it can be off with respect to absolute (or fundamental) value
- This is what happens in a bubble

# Bottom line

- Fundamental analysis can be worthwhile because prices can and do deviate from fundamentals
- Arbitrage fails at times and bubbles arise
- But at the same time, there are always strong forces to exploit opportunities in the market
- You can use the same lens to understand recent trends in markets

# Fundamental Analysis and Recent Trends

# Recent trends

- What about the trend towards passive investments and ETFs?
- Stocks in the indices still need to be valued and priced (by somebody)
- Remember the paradox of efficient markets
- Less crowded field for fundamental analysis should imply larger opportunities
- On top of that, benchmark pressures can exacerbate trends or momentum (and hence mispricing)
What about the rise quant strategies?
- What about machine learning and alternative data?

# Quant investing

- Fundamental approach
- Detailed analysis of financial statements and other data
- Determine "fundamental" value using valuation model
- Fundamental analysis is quantitative
- Quantitative approach uses "models" and "signals"
- Typically conducted for large samples
- Most of the financial statement information is taken as given
- Most models attempt to predict future (or abnormal) returns
- Quant approach and model building requires back testing
- Overfitting is a major risk
- Time-varying risk premia and "shifting" asset pricing models are major challenges
- For short horizons, quant strategies and machines have largely replaced people

# "Quantamental" approach & machine learning

- Combines fundamental and quant
- Incorporate quantitative approaches as well as alternative or big data
- Fundamental approach can leverage the machine
- "Lazy Prices" example fits this description
- Easy to see more sophisticated applications using ML
- Fundamental concepts are still relevant for quant strategies & ML
- Stock return data are very noisy
- Adding structure can help with prediction and causality
- Alternative: Use ML to predict company fundamentals

# Rise of alternative data

- In search of a true info advantage
- Location, credit card, social media data, etc.
- Used to predict sales or for event-driven strategies (e.g., around EA)
- Data are often messy

Use of ML for processing data

Figure 9. Alternative Data Interest by Category

- My bottom line for now:
- Fundamental analysis and active strategies continue to be relevant
- Especially for smaller, less liquid stocks, and over longer investment horizons
- Sloan article that is assigned for this week illustrates this (two case studies)

# Advanced Financial Analysis and Valuation of Global Firms

Introduction

The University of Chicago Booth School of Business

# Game plan for today

- What matters in fundamental analysis and valuation
- Core issues
- Framework and setting the stage for whole course
- Why is understanding the business model so important?
- Introduce idea of value driver model: Keep it simple
- Sustainability of economic profits
- Importance of "moats" and how they relate to mean reversion
- Why not just use multiples?
- Recent trends and what they mean for financial analysis and valuation

# Core Issues in Valuation

# The basis of valuation: Discounted dividend model

- Why do we rarely use a discounted dividend model?
- Dividends are easy to forecast – so why not?
- One problem: Many companies do not pay dividends (but still have value)
- Discounted dividend model just pushes the valuation problem into the future

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e65e72f2-451a-4831-b786-a564ab73d9de/e324595ae2505d70b93d066544a351bb8739970bf694fd8072f5b526005b7508.jpg)

$$
\rho_ {\mathrm {E}} = \text {d i s c o u n t f a c t o r}
$$

$$
(= 1 + \mathrm {c o s t} \mathrm {o f e q u i t y})
$$

$$
V _ {0} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {4} \frac {\overline {{d}} _ {t}}{\rho_ {E} ^ {t}} + \frac {\overline {{T V _ {4}}}}{\rho_ {E} ^ {4}}
$$

# So what do we do instead?

- We use the cash flows between the firm and its product and service markets
- Forecast revenues
- Forecast product or service costs
- Forecast necessary investments
- We then convert these forecasts into free cash flows
- This is essentially the DCF model
- Using the cash flows with the markets leads to an entity model where you first determine the value of the entire entity (or enterprise)

EXHIBIT 8.2 Enterprise Valuation of a Single-Business Company

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e65e72f2-451a-4831-b786-a564ab73d9de/4423ba7d9d9b1695ba39c79f99fdfd0cf9baf4c96808cc08c431cdfe7e82d0c9.jpg)

1 Debt value equals discounted after-tax cash flow to debt holders plus the present value of interest tax shield.

# What are the core challenges in valuation?

- Estimating (or forecasting) the future cash flows
- Especially in the long-run

Sustainability and growth of the future cash flows

- Action is not in the discount factor
- What does it take to estimate the future cash flows?
- Understanding the business model
- Understanding what drives value for the firm
- Understanding "moats" and their link to sustainability
- Keep it simple
- It is not about a complicated Excel model
- Easy to lose "forest for the trees"

# Accounting Analysis and Shenanigans

# Central role of accounting

- Allow us to understand the business model and the economics of the firm
- Profitability and, in particular, value creation
- Connects the narrative and the numbers

Financial statements provide a starting point

- Past trends are often the basis for forecasts
- Savvy accounting analysis needed
- Accounting shenanigans are used to manage expectations
- Analyzing financial statements is at the core of valuation
- This is why this course is an accounting class!

# A few reminders about accounting analysis

- Assume that you are familiar with basic accounting ratios
- ROE decomposition
- Profit margin
- Asset turnover
- Common ratio cheat sheet (on Canvas)
- Separating operating and financing activities
- Excess cash (e.g., Apple) & interest revenue, non-operating assets
- Basic idea: Understand and analyze core business
- We use ROIC rather than ROA
- Invested capital = Operating assets – operating liabilities
- See Koller et al. Chapter 11 (useful guidance)
- Check out Tutorial Review Slides on Canvas

# Why do accounting shenanigans matter?

- Accounting fraud is a very negative event for firm value
- Firms that disclose misstatements or misrepresentation suffer initial declines around  $25\%$  and eventually lose on average close to  $40\%$  of their value
- But typically the idea of financial analysis is not to detect fraud
- This is not a forensic accounting class
- Companies try to influence or manage market expectations
- Distorted view of a firm's underlying economics
- Affects your forecasts and hence the valuation
- Base-year fixation

# Example: Change in amortization method

From 10K: ExampleCo rents equipment to customers. For the fiscal year 2013, ExampleCo completed a review of its rental equipment amortization methodology and updated the methodology in order to add greater precision to cost amortization. The previous method recognized accelerated amortization of costs at a rate faster than the decline in the equipment value due to the recognition of charges in addition to the normal rental curve amortization to account for potential damage. The Company's most recent analysis has shown that its amortization curves can reasonably capture the effect of potential damage and therefore eliminates the need for additional charges and provides a better correlation of costs to revenue. The modified approach to amortizing the cost of the equipment is based on updated rental curves, which incorporate damage estimates, and provides a more systematic method for recognizing the replacement costs. The Company anticipates this new method will better align the recognition of costs with related revenue.

The effect of this change resulted in a reduction of product costs, as reported in operating expenses. The change resulted in a corresponding increase to the balance of our rental equipment inventory. For the fiscal year 2013, the change resulted in a benefit to net income of  $15 million or$ 0.10 in basic earnings per share.

# Importance of the Business Model

# Understanding the business model is key

- We consider different business models (or industry) each week
- Try to understand how a business creates value
- Class is not just about "valuation" but also about value creation
- Consider the value proposition
- Tools of this class can be used to evaluate different strategies
- Competition and impact on value creation
- Business model maps into the accounting numbers (see next slide)

# Business models differ in their numbers

- Industries below differ in key ratios like their profit margin (PM), leverage, operating cycle or market-to-book ratio
- Key ratios reflect differences in the business models or industries

# Basic idea of value driver model

- Focus on the key value drivers in forecasting FCF
- You do not have to forecast each line item from IS or BS
- Spend most of your time on the key value drivers
- Back those up with additional data
- Connect your understanding of the industry and business model as well as changes in strategy to the key value drivers: e.g.,
- New marketing strategy leads to margin improvements
- Synergies improve operating margins
- Better supply-chain management leads to turnover improvements

Key idea:

-A few parameters are enough to estimate the FCF
- You want to "nail" those

# Illustration of (simple) value driver model

- Simple alternative to forecasting detailed line items
- Essentially hard wire line items in your model
- Focus on key parameters:
- Revenue growth
- Operating margin (and tax rate)
- Investment rate (or asset turnover)
- You can bring in other business-model specific drivers
- Connect them to three main drivers

- Sales growth estimates (yoy):  $1.2\%$ ,  $2\%$ ,  $2\%$ ,  $2.2\%$
- Margin and NOA turnover: constant
- Your turnover forecast pins down your forecasted NOA (and hence investments) –  $\Delta$ NOA is change in investment = required net investment

# NOPAT to FCF: Adjusting for non-cash items

- How does the change in NOA adjust for non-cash items?
- Consider change in Net PPE
- The change in Net PPE is Change Gross PPE – Change Accumulated Depreciation
- Subtracting the change in Net PPE from NOPAT means:
- Subtracting the change in Gross PPE (e.g., new stuff bought)
- Adding back depreciation of the period (i.e., undoing non-cash items)
- Consider a firm with 1000 in Net PPE (Gross PPE - Accumulated Depreciation)
- Suppose the firm has depreciation of 200 and buys new PPE for 400
- Avenue 1: Directly adjust investment and depreciation
- To go from NOPAT to FCF, we want to subtract the 400 in investment and add back the 200 in depreciation
- Cash used up is  $200 = 400 - 200$
- Avenue 2: Adjust the net change in PPE
- New Net PPE is 1200
- Change in Net PPE is  $200 = 1200 - 1000$

$\rightarrow$  Non-cash items are automatically adjusted when subtracting the change in NOAA

# Detailed forecasting vs. value-driver approach

- Most common: Detailed (three-statement) approach
- Pro-forma income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement
- More flexibility to capture specific changes, events, and trends
- Be careful about internal consistency
- Value-driver approach
- Focuses on key forecasts & business model
- Less prone to inconsistencies
- Could combine the two approaches in three-stage model
- You can adjust the level of detail over time

# Three-stage model

Time segment

- Forecast period 1
- Forecast period 2

TV period

- Use varying levels of detail
- Forecast period 1: More detail (e.g., line items)
- Forecast period 2: Key value drivers and fading
- TV period: Typically perpetuity (perhaps with growth)
- FCF in TV can also be determined in terms of key value drivers (Week 3)

# Near-term cash flows vs. terminal value

- Forecasted cash flows (or dividends) over the next 2-3 years comprise a relatively small percentage of overall value
- For model with short forecast horizon:
- The bulk of the value resides in the terminal value
- Valuation is very sensitive to terminal value assumptions

Steady-state FCF, growth rate, WACC

What is the purpose of the second stage?

- Normalization
- Fades the FCF to sustainable level before using TV formula
- Almost all the action is in the long run, not the near term
- This is the problem with multiples – focus on the near term (e.g., forward E)
- Market excesses tend to manifest in unrealistic TV valuations

Importance of Moats

# Economic moats

- How do we know a firm create value?
- It generates a return above its cost of capital

Economic profit (ROIC > WACC)

- Ability to do so follows from its strategy and competitive position
- Competitive advantage and economic moats:

"The key to investing is … determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors." (Warren Buffett, Fortune 1999)

- Moat concept combines economic profit and competitive advantage
- Why does the "durability" of the advantage matter?
- Morningstar uses moat concept and assigns:
- Narrow moat: 10 years
- Wide moat: 20 years

Why not focus on long-term (revenue) growth?

# Economic moats (cont.)

Key questions in analyzing companies

- What is the source of the competitive advantage?
- How sustainable is the competitive advantage?
- Moat sources (i.e., reasons why ROIC > WACC)
- Intangible assets (e.g., brands, patents, government licenses)
- Cost advantage (e.g., economies of scale, location)
- Switching costs (e.g., operating systems)
- Network effects (value of services increases as more people use the service)
- Efficient scale (limited market is already served by one or just a few companies)
- Economic moats have a life cycle and are changing over time
- Competition can make moats unstable or erode them (e.g., P&G, SAP)
- Are moats sustainable or narrowing?

High returns attract competitors

- Competitors settle for lower returns that are still attractive
Over time, competition drives ROIC down to the cost of capital

- Economic profit declines on average
- But not necessarily for all companies (at the same rate)
- Moats can play an important role in slowing down the decay in the spread (i.e., difference between ROIC and WACC)

# Multiples Review and Key Challenges

# Multiples

- "Keep it simple"
- So why not just use multiples – a PE ratio is simple?
- Multiples can be a good starting point
- Gauge value of current operations
- Easy to capitalize consensus earnings forecast

If consensus is  $1.50 per share and PE ratio for peer group is 20, then share price should be around$ 30

What is key for this valuation?

- One issue: Multiples typically focus on the near term
- That is in contrast to what we discussed earlier
- When you try to build in the long-run, multiples become tricky

# Basic idea

- PE ratio is essentially based on a perpetuity
- Perpetuity:  $P = CF / r$  (where  $CF$  is cash flow to equity)
- Earnings predict future cash flows
- Includes replacement investments (or maintenance)
- You can view earnings as an estimate of "normalized" cash flow to equity in steady state (rather than the dividend)
- Thus:  $P = E / r \Rightarrow P / E = 1 / r$

This is just the simplest representation

- We can add other factors (e.g., growth)

$$
- P / E = 1 / (r - g)
$$

- PEG ratio
- We can also capitalize different flow variables (e.g., EBITDA)

# Challenges for multiples

- Multiple is essentially a valuation model with a forecast horizon of  $T = 1$
- One-year forward PE ratio
- Complexity of valuation has not disappeared – all 'crammed' into:

Multiple (reflects growth and cost of capital)

- The "E" (needs to be normalized to capture long-run value creation)
- For multiples, comparability is key
- Challenge: Finding comparables and adjusting their earnings
- Adjustments are much more important for multiples (than DCF)
- Differences in strategy and in accounting methods

Acquisitions, operating leases, pensions, stock compensation, etc.

- Earnings need to be normalized (e.g., adjusted for non-recurring items)
- Discontinued operations, impairments, restructuring, etc.

# Which multiple should we use?

- Koller et al. recommend EBITA or NOPAT multiple (see Ch. 18)
- Gives you an entity value
- Just like EV/EBITDA multiple
- Need to subtract financial debt and add financial assets to get to equity value
- By not excluding depreciation, EBITA makes firms with in-house production more comparable to firms with outsourcing
- Why use a number "higher up" in the income statement?
- Tends to be less distorted by non-recurring charges
- EBITA or NOPAT do not commingle operating and financing activities

Less distorted by differences in capital structure across companies

- For PE ratio, comparables need to have similar capital structure (see next slide)

- EV/EBITA is not affected by leverage but PE is
- Note that you cannot even sign the effect of leverage on the PE ratio

# Multiples: Summary

- Relatively quick and "easy"
- Assumes other firms are "comparable" and their securities are correctly priced
- Provides a useful "plausibility check" for DCF model
- Not based on independent fundamental analysis
- Not 'anchored' in value creation

Key messages:

- Multiples only seemingly simple
- Comparability is key
- Entity multiples make it easier to find comparables

These message also apply to multiples used in terminal value calculations

- We come back to TV issues in Week 3

# Common mistakes in analyst reports and DCF models

- Heavy reliance on multiples
- Shortcomings in DCF models:
- Forecast horizon is too short
- Implausible terminal value
- Growth and investment are not connected or incompatible
- Other liabilities (e.g., leases, stock compensation) are not accounted for
- Double counting
- No scenarios
- Green, Hand and Zhang (2016) analyze sample of DCF models in analyst reports
- Find on average 3 mistakes and 4 questionable judgments (e.g., TV)
- Valuation effect ranges from -2% to 14%
- Pre-recordings for this class are designed to help you with some of the technical issues

- Link value to fundamentals
- Quantify the impact of your assumptions
- Understand where your views differ from the consensus or what is already reflected in the market price
- This class is not about "stock picking" - there are many situations that require fundamental analysis & valuation

# We use ROIC rather than the more traditional ROA

- ROIC captures only operating items whereas ROA commingles operating and non-operating
- E.g., net income (ROA's numerator) includes both sales revenue (operating) and gains on trading securities (non-operating)
- E.g., total assets (ROA's denominator) includes both inventory (operating) and excess cash and marketable securities (non-operating)

- UPS' ROIC advantage over FedEx comes from advantages in both operating margin and turnover
- On margin, UPS' benefit is driven by higher reliance on labor (higher compensation/revenues) but lower reliance on equipment (lower purchased transportation/revenues, lower fuel/revenues)
- UPS also has better capital efficiency (invested capital turnover)

# Valuation Review

# Valuation basics

1  $V_{0} = \sum_{t = 1}^{\infty}\frac{Projected\ Future\ Payoffs_{t}}{(1 + Discount\ Rate)^{t}}$  2 3

1 Value today (i.e.,  $t = 0$ )

2 "Flows" expected to be received in the future

- May be received in one lump sum, in a constant stream, or in different amounts each year

3 Discount rate applied to future flows, representing:

Time value of money

- Consumption tomorrow instead of consumption today
- Constant rate for all assets
- Risk of the flows
- Varies by type of flow (capital)

# Valuation basics: Dividend discount model ("DDM")

- In theory, the dividend discount model is what underpins value:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e65e72f2-451a-4831-b786-a564ab73d9de/c324827e9f340556b6fa82bb64aa1c2e96fc3da0c0090cda9e2f7019a8da78d2.jpg)

$$
\text {E q u i t y v a l u e} _ {0} = \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {D _ {t}}{\left(1 + r _ {e}\right) ^ {t}}
$$

- However, the DDM's usefulness relies heavily on the ability to forecast future dividends
- Dividends are chosen by management and many companies do not pay dividends
- In practice, we rarely use the DDM

# Overview of common valuation methods

- Instead, we use measures of flows between the firm and the market(s), e.g., free cash flow, because these flows can be better estimated than dividends

<table><tr><td colspan="4">Common valuation models</td></tr><tr><td>Model</td><td>Measure</td><td>Discount factor</td><td>Assessment</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise DCF
model</td><td>Free cash flow</td><td>Weighted average cost of capital (&quot;WACC&quot;)</td><td>Most commonly used model; assumes that firms manage their capital structure to a target level</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted

# Enterprise vs. equity method valuation

- Enterprise valuation models value the flows (cash flows, earnings, etc.) due to all investors (i.e., both equity and debt holders)
- Equity valuation models value the flows due to equity holders only
- The two models can be bridged by:

$$
\begin{array}{l} E n t e r p r i s e v a l u e = e q u i t y v a l u e \\ + d e b t a n d d e b t e q u i v a l e n t s \\ - \text {c a s h} \\ \end{array}

1 Debt value equals discounted after-tax cash flow to debt holders plus the present value of interest tax shield.

# Enterprise DCF review

- This model discounts free cash flow (i.e., cash flow generated by business operations - less any reinvestment back into the business - that is available to all investors) at the weighted average cost of capital (i.e., a blend of the cost of debt and the cost of equity)
- Ideally used to value companies that will maintain their capital structure at a target leverage ratio

# Four part process

1 Free cash flow ("FCF")

- Forecast operating line items and line items affecting invested capital
Calculate net operating profit after tax ("NOPAT") and changes to invested capital
Calculate projected FCF

2 Discounting

Calculate WACC

Discount FCFs in forecasted range by WACC

3 Continuing value

Calculate continuing value with long-term growth rate, WACC, and return on new invested capital (RONIC)

Discount continuing value to arrive at present value

4 Equity value

Sum present value of FCFs and continuing value to arrive at enterprise value

- Calculate equity value from enterprise value, net debt, non-controlling interest (if any), preferred stock (if any)

# Enterprise DCF review (cont.)

# 1 Free cash flow ("FCF")

- At a high level, free cash flow is calculated as:
- FCF = NOPAT + D&A (depreciation & amortization) – increase in non-cash WC (working capital) - capital expenditures + other adjustments to invested capital

# 2 Discounting

- Calculate the present value of FCFs in the explicit forecast period by discounting the forecasted FCFs with WACC:

where:

- debt  $(D)$  and equity  $(E)$  are measured using market values where possible
- $k_{d}$  represents the cost of debt
- $k_{e}$  represents the cost of equity
- $T_{m}$  represents the marginal tax rate, which is used to value the interest tax shield
- Apply a mid-year adjustment to the PVs as appropriate

# 3 Continuing value

Continuing value represents the value of the firm's FCFs after the explicit forecast period

- It is typically a perpetuity
- With growth & reinvestment, continuing value is defined as:

$$
\text {C o n t i n u i n g V a l u e} _ {t} = \frac {\mathrm {N O P L A T} _ {t + 1} \left(1 - \frac {g}{\mathrm {R O N I C}}\right)}{\mathrm {W A C C} - g}
$$

where:

- $g$  represents the long-term growth rate
- RONIC represents the return on new invested capital
Further discounted by WACC to determine present value of continuing value

<table><tr><td colspan="2">$ million</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Key inputs1</td></tr><tr><td>Projected NOPLAT in 2024</td><td>9,700</td></tr><tr><td>NOPLAT growth rate in perpetuity (g)</td><td>3.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Return on new invested capital (RONIC)</td><td>22.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted average cost of capital (WACC)</td><td>8.0%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Continuing value_t = \frac{NOPLAT_{t+1}\left(1 - \frac{g}{RONIC}\right)}{WACC - g} = 168,231</td></tr></table>

1 Rounded inputs calculate to \(168,018 million, whereas this model uses unrounded data.

# Enterprise DCF review (cont.)

# Equity value calculation

Sum the present values of the forecasted FCFs and the continuing value

- (+) the present value of non-operating assets (e.g., equity investments) if applicable
- (-) net debt (debt and debt equivalents minus cash and cash equivalents)
- (-) the value of preferred stock and noncontrolling interest if applicable
Estimated price per share  $=$  equity value divided by the number of shares outstanding

# Competitive strategies

- Both cost leadership and differentiation strategies exist in food retail
- Earlier slide comparing Kroger and Walmart
- Hard discount (Aldi):
- Small assortment (i.e., low numbers of products or so-called SKUs)
Focus on high-turn merchandise & private labels
- Almost no customer experience (no frills)
- Upscale grocery retailing (Wholefoods):
- Products
In-store experience
(Since Amazon acquisition: E-commerce strategy)

# Threat of entry

- Threat of entry in retail is high:
- Costs of opening a store are relatively low
- However, larger retailers have economies of scale in buying and distribution that allows them to lower costs

Scale and distribution networks present significant entry barriers

# Substitutes

- Threats from substitutes in retail is generally high
- Narrow vs. broader perspective
- What is a broad substitute in food retail?
- Example: Private labels are primarily used by discounted formats

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e65e72f2-451a-4831-b786-a564ab73d9de/ce89b3305ea5369ffa7223769522cbdf9f433d9385f51feae7839c655127667f.jpg)

# Substitutes (cont.)

- Alternative channels for 'how to buy' can viewed as 'substitute'

– Online shopping & home delivery service

- E-commerce is a major threat for many retailers
- Share of digital retailing keeps rising
- Specialty retail (e.g., toys) have been particularly threatened by e-commerce

Groceries had been more resilient

- Pandemic has changed this
- Retailers have responded to the digital threat with:
- Optimization of footprint
- Improvements in shopping experience
- Multi-channel strategies (e.g., Walmart.com, WFM & Amazon Prime)

# Even pre-pandemic, physical stores closed at high rates

- Despite strong consumer economy, U.S. store closures of 9,000+ in 2019 beat the previous record of 8,000 in 2017
- Early in 2020 (pre-pandemic), retailers announced 1,200+ planned closures

Quartz | qz.com | Data: Coresight Research | Note: 2019 figures are year-to-date as of Dec. 13

- Big Box stores play important role (e.g., Costco, Sam's Club)

# Bargaining power: Customers & suppliers

- Consumers typically have no bargaining power, but:
- Consumers have practically zero switching costs, especially in specialty retail
- For groceries/general merchandise, variety in assortment could create switching costs (i.e., shopping for all needs in one trip vs. multiple)
- Depending on size, retailers may have bargaining power in their relationship with vendors and suppliers
- Classic example is Walmart
- Where do you see this in the financials of the vendors?

# Retailers' share of vendor revenue

# Kraft Heinz (10-K for FY ended Dec-2017)

Our largest customer, Walmart Inc., represented approximately  $21 \%$ of our net sales in 2017,  $22 \%$ of our net sales in 2016, and approximately  $20 \%$ of our net sales in 2015. All of our segments have sales to Walmart Inc.

# PepsiCo (10-K for FY ended Dec-2017)

We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. In 2017, sales to Walmart (including Sam's) represented approximately  $13 \%$ of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers.

# Summary of retail industry analysis

- Retailers face a complex and fiercely competitive environment, low barriers to entry and clear substitutes, in particular, in the form of e-commerce, which is gaining market share
- Fiercely competitive environment and secular changes are also evident in many bankruptcy filings:
- Bed Bath and Beyond (2023)
- Paper Source (2021)
- Christopher & Banks (2021)
- Century 21 (2020)
- Sur La Table (2020)
- The Bon-Ton Stores (2018)
- Toys "R" Us (2017)
- Gymboree (2017)
- Sports Authority (2016)
- Circuit City (2009)

# Still, some retailers have carved out decent moats

- Tractor Supply (TSCO) operates rural lifestyle retail store in the U.S.
- This is a very specific niche that few other retailers serve
- Very healthy profitability

# Key value driver (or KPI) in retail

- Asset or inventory turnover
- Gross margin; operating margin
- Same-store sales (SSS):
- Sales per square foot
- Traffic and ticket

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">FYE 1/31/2018</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tiffany &amp; Co.</td><td>Walmart</td></tr><tr><td>Net sales ($MM)</td><td>$4,170</td><td>$495,761</td></tr><tr><td>Increase (decrease) in comparable sales</td><td>0%</td><td>2.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Sales per square foot ($)</td><td>$3,156</td><td>$428</td></tr><tr><td>Gross margin</td><td>62.5%</td><td>24.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Operating margin</td><td>19.1%</td><td>4.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Inventory turnover</td><td>0.7x</td><td>8.6x</td></tr></table>

# Turnover and cash conversion cycle

- Turnover is essentially an efficiency measure
- Cash conversion cycle (or net operating cycle):
- Days in inventory + days in receivables – days in payables
- Captures how quickly a firm sells inventory, collects payments from customers for the inventory sold, and how long it can wait to pay its suppliers
- Goal: high inventory turns + high A/R turns – low A/P turns
- Ideally: sell inventory & collect cash from customers before paying to suppliers
- Negative cash conversion cycle (in days)
- A/P turns depend on the bargaining power with vendors and suppliers
- Low inventory turns likely indicate merchandise that is out of favor, leading to excess inventory, clearance sales, etc.
- Leading indicator of future problems
- A/R turns are usually less important – Why?

# Margins

- Close link between competitive strategy analysis and this value driver
- Gross margin indicates pricing or bargaining power
- Gross margins depend on format, mix, and strategic decisions, such as private label offerings
- Composition effects are important to understand

Different brands

- Brands vs. private label
- Gross margins in retail tend to be reasonably stable
- Most retailers pass cost savings on to consumers
- But they tend to adjust pricing to inflation
- Operating margins
- Brings in other costs: SG&A
- Payroll, store layout and footprint efficiency

# Same store sales (SSS)

- Same store sales growth measures sales at locations open for at least a year and excludes sales from new stores
- Also known as comparable store sales or comps
- Organic growth of comparable footage
- New store openings are linked to capex and asset turnover
- Same store sales depends on traffic and ticket size
- Traffic growth: Growth in customers entering the store and purchasing merchandise
- Ticket size growth: Changes in the average purchase in dollars
- What happens if a new store doesn't fully mature in 12 months?
- Some of the same store sales comes from maturing stores
- Creates correlation between SSS growth and growth from new stores

# Revenue Forecasting

# Building detailed forecasts

- Revenue (growth) is likely the most important forecast in your model

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e65e72f2-451a-4831-b786-a564ab73d9de/5538c9f8dd51e6fba0889a93ff08cde6c1492224f0a53e310064aa0cfbacb98c.jpg)

- Try to "ground" your forecast in data
- Outside view (base rates)
Detailed bottom-up metrics (use KPI or disaggregated data)

- Generally, it is a good idea to derive the revenue forecast by segment (if there are several segments)
- This approach allows you to capture different dynamics in different segments
- Different segments likely have different growth rates

# Total Addressable Market: Zoom

TAM estimates (as of June 2020):

- S-1 (at IPO) estimated unified communications (UC) market to have a TAM of $43bn by 2022

J.P. Morgan estimates TAM of roughly 40bn

- However, TAM could increase with use case expansions (education, phone)
- Morgan Stanley estimates TAM of $100bn+
- Traditional UC market + combined education and UC market

TAM estimates (as of November 2022):

– Morningstar considered TAM to be $35 billion when Zoom issued its S-1

– In Nov 2022, Morningstar updated Zoom’s TAM to approximately $100 billion

In particular, we believe Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center will contribute significantly to revenue growth over the next decade. We see this substantial market as being able to support multiple winners, and double-digit growth for years to come.

# Forecasting costs

- Many other forecasts are derived relative to sales
- Costs are typically estimated as a fraction of sales
- Asset turnover forecast essentially "fixes" investment relative to sales

What about fixed costs?

- Does it make sense to predict margins (or COGS) relative to sales?
- Let's take a quick vote

# Illustration: COGS for Starbucks

Estimating the relation between COGS and Sales

COGS = -2.214 + 0.794 x Sales

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e65e72f2-451a-4831-b786-a564ab73d9de/cff43090827e2af54f4fdc81e00d8118322455f8a9d6724d66a629cbe677554c.jpg)

Estimating the relation between SG&A and Sales

SG&A = 10.42 + 0.051 x Sales

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e65e72f2-451a-4831-b786-a564ab73d9de/20b0975b4f2727c8066e43e41e7ebcf0c7c45c9d6d5dab6857fd0542cddcc257.jpg)

# What about fixed costs? (cont.)

- Turnover forecasts are relative to revenues
- What does this imply?
- Is this reasonable? Let's consider UPS or Fedex (trucks, planes, etc.)
- Fixed costs can matter for your capex forecasting some industries or firms
- Pulp and paper
- Semiconductors
- Tesla (Gigafactory)
- Other situations when costs do not behave linearly
- "Sticky" costs when firms face declines in business
- Turnaround situation (costs do not expand as fast)
- Scale effects in high growth companies (efficiency gains as they grow)

# Bottom up: "Unit economics"

- Unit economics help us better understand the underlying drivers of a business
- How much revenue does a single unit generate?
- What are the costs to generate a single unit of business?
- Looking at a business in an atomistic manner helps clarify its profitability (or value creation)
- Once a unit is understood, it can be scaled up to value the entire business
- Existing "units" can be valued with a DCF
- Appropriate growth rates can be estimated by determining the number, cost, and value of future units
- Leads to simplified valuation model
- Will come back to such a model in later week

Revenue per customer (or seat mile)

- Cost to acquire unit
Supply of seat miles of each unit (airplane)

# How do we determine what unit level to look at?

- Business can have a variety of units
- Demand side: Customer  $\rightarrow$  Store  $\rightarrow$  Region  $\rightarrow$  Country
Supply side: Employee  $\rightarrow$  Team or Equipment  $\rightarrow$  Factory

- Benefits to further decomposition
- Each successive level down will help simplify the economic analysis
- It is much easier to understand a customer than a neighborhood, or a neighborhood than a city or a country
- Drawbacks to further decomposition
- Firm disclosures do not not always provide info at the most granular level
- False precision when re-aggregating lower levels of units into overall firm value
- Given this tradeoff: No need for further decomposition, if we can understand the value drivers of a business at a higher level

# High-level summary

- Revenue forecast is likely the most important one
- Understand the product/service of the specific business
- Focus on the key drivers of revenue and revenue change
- Identify the "units" to focus on
- Consider macro trends and addressable market
- Build top down forecasts
- As a driver of aggregate demand, GDP is often not enough
- Consider explicit links to customer demographics and spending patterns
- Combine with bottom-up forecasts
- Consider detailed transaction/customer-level data

# Accounting Analysis and Shenanigans in Retail

# Financial Shenanigans

- How can managers use accounting and financial reporting to create the desired picture of firm performance or trend in financial numbers?
- Use discretion in the accounting rules
- Three types of shenanigans:
- Accounting shenanigans
- Cash flow shenanigans
- Non-GAAP reporting (or KPI) shenanigans

For retail: e.g., same-store sales growth

# Under Armour: Channel stuffing

Over six consecutive quarters beginning in 2015 Q3, Under Armour pulled forward sales orders of about $408 million that customers had requested be delivered in future periods

- Goal was to meet quarterly analyst targets
- To induce wholesale customers to accept sales orders, the company to offer incentives such as discounts or extended payment terms
- The SEC investigated UA in 2019 alleging that the company misled investors by not disclosing a significant portion of its revenue and revenue growth resulted from the practice
- UA agreed to pay $9 million to settle regulatory claims

# Under Armour: Revenue recognition

- Since going public, Under Armour has emphasized its consistent revenue growth, and regularly reported revenue growth exceeding analysts' consensus forecasts
SEC charged Under Armour for misleading investors regarding:

- Bases of its revenue growth
- Uncertainties concerning future revenue prospects

In Q3 and Q4 2015:

- Revenue and revenue growth forecasts fall short of analyst forecasts
- E.g., slower sales of more expensive winter apparel due to warm weather
- Under Armour "pulls forward" $408 million in existing orders customers requested to be shipped in future quarters (over six quarters)
- Reliance on "pull forwards" increases over time as the gap between actual and projected revenue gets bigger
- Under Armour agreed to cease and desist from further violations and to pay a $9 million penalty

# Vendor rebates at Tesco

- Large retailers receive refunds/rebates from vendors
- These cash inflows to the retailer should be recognized as an adjustment to cost of inventories or COGS
- Tesco boosted revenues and earnings by recognizing rebates and refunds as revenue
- Tesco announced on September 22, 2014 that it had overstated its expected H1 profit by £250MM or  $23\%$ . Four senior employees were asked to step down during the course of the investigation

Retailers and supplier rebates

Buying up the shelves

Supplier rebates are at the heart of some supermarket chains' woes

MEETING angry shareholders is an experience few company bosses savour. Yet on June 26th Dave Lewis, the new chief executive of Tesco, Britain's largest supermarket chain, will have to do exactly that. The firm will hold its first annual meeting since revealing that it had inflated its profits by £263m (\$421m) through wrongly booking rebates from suppliers—

prompting his predecessor's departure. Since then little has gone right for Tesco: sales have continued to slide, and the falling value of its property has forced it to declare a pre-tax loss of £6.4 billion for the year to February. Worse still, a Serious Fraud Office inquiry has been opened into the accounting scandal, which could cost the firm more than the error itself.

# KPI: Same store sales at Coach

- SSS is one of the most used KPI in retail
- Especially important when a company is growing though store openings as it separates organic from inorganic growth
- It is a non-GAAP metric
- Management has substantial discretion in its definition

Coach, Inc.

- SSS definition in FY2012:

Comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months, and includes sales from coach.com. Coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operation. Similarly, stores that are expanded by  $15\%$  or more are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first anniversary of their reopening. Stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base.

- SSS definition in FY2013:

Comparable store sales measure sales performance at stores that have been open for at least 12 months, and includes sales from the Internet. Coach excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operation. Similarly, stores that are expanded by  $15\%$  or more are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first anniversary of their reopening. Beginning in fiscal 2014, comparable store sales will not be adjusted for store expansions given our planned transformation related to capital investments.

# KPI: Same store sales at Coach (cont.)

- Rationale for old definition:
- Growth related to large store expansions should not be considered same-store sales
- When did they make this change?

– Company launched multi-year plan to expand the most productive stores

- SSS growth was decreasing before the change

# Key case facts

- In 2007, Dollar General received an acquisition offer from KKR for $7.3BN
– Represented a  $31 \%$ premium over the stock price at the time
- Transaction value / actual FY2006 EBITDA = 16.3x
- The agreement was approved unanimously by the board of directors
Shareholders sued, arguing that the agreed price undervalued Dollar General
- Debt investors were concerned the merger would ratchet up Dollar General's leverage too much at a time when Dollar General's operating performance was also under pressure
- Poll: Would you approve the agreement?
- Note: The year references in the case materials are confusing as the FY end falls into the next calendar year. So, the FY ending Feb 2, 2007 is often referred to as (fiscal) year 2006.

# Case questions

- Assessment of DG performance
- Key ratios
- Over time
- Relative to its peers
- How do you explain the decline in performance in fiscal 2006?
- How do you assess the valuation multiple offered by KKR?
- Compute pro-forma for fiscal 2006 (i.e., fiscal year ending in Feb. 2007) and forecast for fiscal 2007 (i.e., fiscal year ending in Feb. 2008)
- Assess the offer based on pro-forma multiple and forward multiple
- Let's start with KPIs for deep discount and key ratios for DG

# Assessment of DG performance: Over time

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e65e72f2-451a-4831-b786-a564ab73d9de/d601743b7e357519daa1d47f65419132711297a7c836491c1a685bf50c71a53d.jpg)

Operating Income as Percentage of Sales

- Sharp decline in earnings from  $350.2MM in FY2005 to$ 137.9MM in FY2006, despite increase in revenues
- Increase in COGS and SG&A as % of revenue
- Absolute increase in COGS greater than increase in revenue due to higher inventory impairment and shrinkage (margin  $\downarrow$ )
- Increase in market ratios driven by smaller denominator
- Market may have viewed earnings decline as transitory

# Assessment of DG performance: Relative to peers

- Family Dollar (size, business overlap) and Dollar Tree (size) seem to be reasonable comparables
- Until FY2006, DG's profit margin was better than Family Dollar's but worsened due to the new strategy
- DG's FY2006 ROA and ROE were worse than Family Dollar's or Dollar Tree's
- DG's market ratios tend to look better than peers (Why? Driven by denominator)
- Market-to-book is more stable than PE (less affected by transitory items)

# Cause for DG performance decline

# Restructuring plan

- Closing of 400 stores and opening / remodeling of 300 new stores
- Higher SG&A expenses from lease contract terminations and other store-closing costs
- Higher SG&A expenses from increased advertising cost
- Revamping inventory management with new strategy that depends on clearance sales
- Mark-downs and inventory impairment charges recorded in FY2006
- New strategies expected to contribute negatively to earnings beyond current FY (\$71.2MM remaining in special items)
- What do you do with these future charges in 2007 valuation?
- DG expects its new strategies to enhance store appearance and customer satisfaction while reducing employee turnover and inventory shrink
- Does the market pricing or the KKR offer reflect these improvements?

# Mark down adjustment

- Markdowns have two effects:
- Those below costs lead to impairments (captured by adj. for inventory impairment)
- Those above cost reduce margin
- Assume that if no strategy change, markdowns in 2006 would have increased with actual sales growth:  $106.5 \text{MM} * (1 + 6.8\%) =$ 113.8MM
- The difference (\(279.1MM-\)113.8MM = \(165.3MM) should have been sold at standard margins without the markdown:
- They would have contributed to gross profit
- $\$ 165.3$ MM *  $25.8\%$  margins = $\$ 42.7$ MM if using actual FY2006
- $\$ 165.3$ MM *  $28.7 \%$ margins = $\$ 47.5$ MM if using FY2005 because actual FY2006 margins are likely depressed
- But  $28.7\%$  is the topline margin relative to sales. We need the margin as it relates to the cost number:
- $28.7\% / (1 - 28.7\%) = 40.3\%$  margin relative to COGS
- $165.3MM * 40.3\% = \$  66.6M$

# Assessment of DG's future prospects

# Forecast for FY2007 (year ended Feb. 2008)

- Key drivers are growth, gross margin, and SG&A – two reasonable approaches:
- Assume FY2006 was an outlier, undo the effects with pro forma and then use average of the past (our approach)
- Assume strategy will lead to different values in the future, start from pro forma but adjust to reasonable estimates for future drivers
Sales growth:
- Base off of historical sales growth and pro forma FY2006 sales growth
- Gross margin:
- Consider average of historical and pro forma FY2006 gross margin
- SG&A expense as % of revenues:
- Consider average of historical and pro forma FY2006 metric
- Interest income and expense: Use actual from FY2006 (for simplicity)
- Effective tax rate: Use actual from FY2006
- Depreciation: Use past relation with sales (as store growth likely leads to D&A)

# Assessment of KKR offer

# Valuation

- KKR offer: Transaction value / actual FY2006 EBITDA = 16.3x
- Prior M&A transactions:
- Average = 8.9x
- Transactions of similar size (KKR / Toys "R" Us; Bain and Blackstone / Michaels) Average = 10.9x
- Peer companies:
- Compared to Family Dollar and Dollar Tree multiples, DG's transaction value / adj. EBITDA is high
- Relative to all companies in set, the transaction value / adj. EBITDA is also high

Case analysis

- DG's transaction value / adj. EBITDA = around 12x (11.6 - 12.1)
- Using transaction value / forward EBITDA = around 9.5x

# Short-term aftermath

- On June 22, 2007, Dollar General's shareholders approved the offer to take the company private
– Dollar General said that of the shares that voted—249.8 million shares, more than  $79\%$  of the total outstanding— $99\%$  were in favor of the merger
- Chairman and CEO David A. Perdue said that he would retire upon completion of the deal
– Mr. Perdue realized ~$30 million from the transaction
- End of July, 2007, the banks that financed the deal sold the debt to TPG for as little as 87 cents on the dollar

# Longer-term aftermath

- Dollar General IPO-ed in November 2009 and raised $823 million, making it the largest retail IPO in more than a decade
- With the advent of the pandemic, Dollar General benefited from a combination of economic uncertainty and consumer desire to stock up on household goods – As of January 8, 2021, its stock had risen  $40\%$  compared to one year prior
- It rose to over $250 in 2022 (but has declined substantially in 2023)

# Key Take-Aways

- Measurement of corporate performance is challenging
- There are often one-time or non-recurring events
- Their relevance differs when we are judging performance ex post versus when we are predicting future performance
- Comparing performance across firms is even more challenging as it requires understanding differences in business model, strategy and accounting choices
- Financial statement analysis helps to make predictions and comparisons
- Valuation using multiples needs to make many adjustments for comparability
- Good multiples valuation is quite complex

# Why go private?

# Broader motivations

- The mid-2000s were a peak time for LBOs from an investor standpoint due to the availability of debt, cash-flush investors seeking higher returns, and a track record of successful LBOs
- On the firm side, firms often embark on an LBO:
- To reduce agency costs by more closely uniting ownership and management (governance)
- Financial engineering and taxes
- Cost of being a public firm
- Because mgmt believes the public market is undervaluing the firm

# Dollar General motivations

- DG was in the middle of turnaround strategy and faced a lot of pressure from investors
- Short-term focus
- DG management likely believed executing their turnaround strategy would be easier when removed from Wall Street pressure
- But management also stands to gain in the LBO

# Review: Economic profit

- Economic profit measures the value created in a single period and is defined by:

$$
E c o n o m i c P r o f i t = I n v e s t e d C a p i t a l \times (R O I C - W A C C)
$$

$$
E c o n o m i c P r o f i t = N O P L A T - (I n v e s t e d C a p i t a l \times W A C C)

1 ROIC measured using beginning of year capital.

# Economic profit model

- This approach is also called: Accounting-based valuation or abnormal earnings model

# Four part process

# 1 Economic profit

Forecast operating line items and line items affecting invested capital

Calculate net operating profit after tax ("NOPAT") and invested capital ("NOA")

Calculate WACC

Calculate projected economic profit

# 2 Discounting

# 3 Continuing value

Discount economic profit in forecasted range by WACC

Calculate continuing value with long-term growth rate, WACC, and return on new invested capital (RONIC)

Discount continuing value to arrive at present value

# 4 Equity value

Sum today's invested capital and present values of economic profit and continuing value to arrive at enterprise value

Calculate equity value from enterprise value, net debt, noncontrolling interest (if any), preferred stock (if any)

- Both EP model and DCF model should arrive at the same valuation

# Entity model using economic profit

- You can discount future economic profits to determine entity value:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {F i r m v a l u e} _ {0} = N O A _ {0} + \frac {N O P A T _ {1} - W A C C * N O A _ {0}}{(1 + W A C C)} \\ + \frac {N O P A T _ {2} - W A C C * N O A _ {1}}{\left(1 + W A C C\right) ^ {2}} + \dots \\ \end{array}
$$

- Firm value = entity value
- NOPAT is net operating profit after tax
- NOA is the book value of net operating assets (at t-1)
WACC is the same weighted average cost of capital as the one used in DCF

- Once you have the entity value (EV), you follow the same steps as for WACC and subtract financial obligations and add financial assets
- Note: You could also use equity model and discount abnormal earnings – Abnormal earnings:  $AE = NI - CoE * BVE = (ROE - CoE) * BVE$

# Why use another model?

- "In the end, we care about the cash flows"
- Even for DCF we start by forecasting balance sheets and income statements
- We estimate earnings and use accruals (e.g., AR, AP)
- We then "unravel" accruals to determine FCFs
- So even DCF relies heavily on accounting and financial statements
- Reasonable question: Could you map earnings directly into value?
- You cannot simply discount earnings
- But you can discount economic profits (or abnormal earnings)
- Economic profit (or accounting-based) model helps us:
- Better understand performance
- Focus on value creation
- Both should improve our forecasts
- Provides intuition for MTB ratio (will show at the end)

# Why does it work?

# Intuition

# Shareholders' equity account and dividends

- Clean surplus: 'All changes in equity values flow through the income statement'

# Equity

$ Beginning Balance + Net income

- Dividends

$ Ending Balance

Be  $t = B V E_{t - 1} + N I_{t} - D_{t}$

When is this not true?

Foreign currency translation

Marketable securities

But such violations are in expectation zero and hence this is not a big deal

# DDM and accounting-based valuation are equivalent

- Simply replace dividend  $D_{t}$  with  $N I_{t} + B V E_{t - 1} - B V E_{t}$

$$
\mathrm {P} _ {0} = \sum_ {\mathrm {t} = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {\mathrm {D} _ {\mathrm {t}}}{\left(1 + \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {e}}\right) ^ {\mathrm {t}}} = \sum_ {\mathrm {t} = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {\mathrm {N I} _ {\mathrm {t}} + \mathrm {B V E} _ {\mathrm {t} - 1} - \mathrm {B V E} _ {\mathrm {t}}}{\left(1 + \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {e}}\right) ^ {\mathrm {t}}} = \mathrm {B V E} _ {0} + \sum_ {\mathrm {t} = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {\mathrm {N I} _ {\mathrm {t}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {e}} \times \mathrm {B V E} _ {\mathrm {t} - 1}}{\left(1 + \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {e}}\right) ^ {\mathrm {t}}}

Cyclical Industries

(and Advanced Forecasting)

CHICAGOBOOTH

The University of Chicago Booth School of Business

# Today

- Industry analysis for cyclical companies
- Important and classic industries
- Cyclicality poses problems when forecasting
- While cyclical industries are special, the underlying forecasting problems are more broadly relevant
- Base-year fixation or issues with trend extrapolation arise all the time
- Market sentiment cycles & bull/bear markets
- Terminal value in your model
- Shenanigans: Often about portraying a trend
- Westlake case
- Terminal value considerations

# Cyclical industries

- Cyclical companies exhibit a repeating pattern of increases and decreases for sales, earnings, investments
Examples

- Basic materials (e.g., steel, aluminum, chemicals, pulp & paper)
- Industrial materials & equipment (e.g., specialty chemicals, construction equipment, machinery, trucks, agricultural equipment)
- Airlines, energy
- Why are these industries cyclical?
- Fiercely competitive (firms tend to be price takers)

Prices for products change as demand changes

- High-fixed costs
- Capacity choices are response to fierce competition (efficiency)
- Investments are often cyclical
Managerial choices exacerbate the demand cycles

# Example: Truck OEM

- Truckers (TL) delay purchasing in bad times and scrap less equipment, extending the average life of the fleet
- Exacerbates cyclicality
- How can you estimate average life of equipment in financials?

# Competitive Analysis

# Competitive (and moat) analysis

- Many cyclical companies operate in fiercely competitive markets
- Price takers
- Demand-driven cycle (as illustrated for truck OEMs)
- There are companies with somewhat differentiated products

-Specialty chemicals

- Equipment manufacturers
- Main source of competitive advantage is being a (or the) low-cost producer

Economies of scale create a barrier to entry

- Few other moats

-In rare cases:

Patents or intangibles

- Switching costs due to highly concentrated industry (few choices)

# Competitive analysis (cont.)

- Efficiency is key
- Important concept: Operating leverage – What do we mean by it?

High fixed costs

- Operating profits increase with volume
- Profitability (and hence operating leverage) drives capacity investment
- Trucker example (and next slide)

# Capital allocation in cyclical companies

1 Change in net property, plant, and equipment adjusted for inflation.

# Supply-side cyclicality: Capital allocation

- This investment behavior exacerbates demand-driven price cycles
- Capacity expansions tend to come in large chunks

Large expansions at the peak translate into excess capacity in the downturn

- Expensive to shut down an operation/facility once started
- Thus, supply-side effects make the industry even more cyclical
- Why do cyclical companies tend to invest at the "worst" time?
- Easier to get approval or buy-in with profitability

E.g., board approval is easier

- Easy access to financing in booms (bank lending is cyclical too)
- Uncertain when cycle ends: Peer and competitive pressure

Duration of Economic Moat

Wide (O Companies) 0%

Narrow (12 Companies) 41%

None (17 Companies) 59%

Morningstar Moat Analysis:

- Cost advantages and intangible assets (often regulatory barriers to entry) are main sources
- Companies that produce cement or aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel) with low value-weight ratio compete in local rather than global mkts
- High shipping costs mean that local producers have a cost advantage
- Moats are rare because barriers to entry are usually surmountable

Economic profits are often scant enough to question sustainability for 15-20 years

- High capital intensity can create small but tenuous spread between ROIC and WACC

# Morningstar Moat Analysis:

- Commodity processor moats are generally built on switching costs, cost advantages, and intangible assets
- Wide economic moats are hard to come by for commodity processors. Cost advantages often prove unsustainable, rarely leading to a moat
- For the other moat sources, we look at how successful competitors have been at replicating a product, process, or technology … The less successful rivals have been, the wider the moat
- Downstream companies in this space constantly strive to innovate. However, innovation is not easy or free. Thus, we rarely grant wide moats to commodity processors

Duration of Economic Moat

# Morningstar Moat Analysis:

- A sustainable low-cost advantage is the main (potential) source of economic moat
- As these companies produce undifferentiated commodities, switching costs, network effect, brands or patents, and efficient scale aren't competitive advantages
- Low-cost producers with multi-decade reserve lives are the only potential candidates for a wide moat, but these are rare
- Geological deposits are finite, meaning new resources must be acquired or found and developed. This can be capital-intensive
- Moats based solely on cost advantage are hard to sustain

# Moat example: "Verbundstrategie" at Base

- BASF's unique "Verbund" structure generates a cost advantage
What is a "Verbund"?

- Moniker to describe large-scale chemical production complexes
- "Verbund" groups chemical production plants together and vertically integrates production
- By-products of one plant can be used as raw material at another
- Heat from production captured and used as energy elsewhere
- German Verbund site: 160 chemical production plants, 35K employees, 10 square kilometer area
- Cost advantage:
- Lower transportation cost, less energy use, higher production yields
- "Verbund" structure generates cost reduction of EUR 1bn (relative to 6.7bn in operating income)
- Unique in how they (vertically) link numerous plants together at the same scale

# Key Value Drivers

# Production costs and margins

- Thin margins are typical for commodity cyclicals: Important to understand production costs
- Example: Alcoa is world largest alumina producer outside of China
- Production costs at various Alcoa alumina refineries relative to global cost curve
- Curve shows industry capacity and that several Alcoa refineries have relatively low cash costs
- Cost curve is quite flat: What does this imply?

# Asset turnover

- Given thin margins, efficiency is key
- Remember the tradeoff between margins and turnover
- Best players are often companies that utilize their asset base more efficiently
- Analysts often focus on margins given their focus on EPS and PE multiples

Westlake case

- But asset utilization is key to the business model for many cyclicals
- Moreover, asset turnover is key for economic profit & value creation
- Recall from pre-recording:

Economic profit = NOPAT - WACC * Invested Capital

- Higher turnover means firm produces the same NOPAT with fewer assets
- Implies lower capital charge

# Asset turnover (cont.)

- Example: Nucor vs US Steel
- US Steel relies on traditional blast furnaces
- Nucor uses electric arc furnaces, which require less investment per unit of installed capacity

# Operating and financial leverage

- High fixed costs (or operating leverage) amplify revenue volatility for cyclicals
- Cost stickiness and adjustment costs
- Due to large fixed investments, cyclicals often carry substantial debt
- Interest is a fixed cost
- Creates substantial bankruptcy risk
- Cyclicals face a dangerous combination of operating and financial leverage
- Financial risk analysis is important

Example: Airlines

# Forecasting for and Valuations of Cyclical Companies

# What are key challenges?

- Volatile historical earnings makes projections more difficult
- Business and hence revenues and profits often depend on macro factors (commodity price or GDP growth)
- Potential problem for analysis: Commingling macro factors and firm factors
- Separating view on the company from view on macro and commodity prices
- Difficult to know where we are in the cycle (or how long it lasts)
Fixation on base year in creating forecasts for future years

- Extrapolating past trends for cyclicals could lead to big valuation errors
- Current cash flows and earnings depend on where we are in the cycle
- Exxon Mobile example (see next slides)

# Example: Exxon in March 2009

- Valuing Exxon:

– In 2008 when average oil price was $87/barrel, Exxon had a banner year with $66.3bn in operating income, $45.2bn in net income, and $6.9bn in net capex

- At effective tax rate of  $35 \%$ , could estimate FCF =  $66.3 \mathrm{bn} * (1 - 35 \%) =$  36.15bn
- Assuming cost of capital of  $9.44\%$  and  $2\%$  growth rate in perpetuity:

Value of operating assets =

$$
= \frac {\text {E x p e c t e d F C F F n e x t y e a r}}{(\text {C o s t o f c a p i t a l} - g)} = \frac {3 6 . 1 5 (1 . 0 2)}{(0 . 0 9 4 4 - 0 . 0 2)} = \$ 4 9 5. 3 4 b i l l i o n
$$

- Subtracting net debt to arrive at equity value:

Value of equity = Value of operating assets + cash - debt

$$
= \$ 4 9 5. 3 4 + \$ 3 2. 0 1 - \$ 9. 4 = \$ 5 1 7. 9 5 b i l l i o n
$$

- Compared to its market cap ($320.4bn at the time), Exxon seems significantly undervalued
- More likely that above valuation does not properly adjust for cycle

# Example: Exxon in March 2009 (cont.)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e65e72f2-451a-4831-b786-a564ab73d9de/53fda4b58f315dee6842c4f9a29dd8d9f431a4188eb421c5f37e2f759be2116c.jpg)

Figure 1: Operating Income versus Oil Prices for Exxon Mobil: 1985-2008

# Example: Exxon in March 2009 (cont.)

- Normalize oil price: Choose midpoint of the cycle and express operating income as a function of normalized oil price
- Regress operating income on oil price per barrel over the period to obtain:

$$
\begin{aligned} \text{Operating Income} & = -6,395 + 911.32(\text{Average Oil Price})\quad \mathrm{R}^{2} = 90.2\% \\ & (2.95) \end{aligned}
$$

– By March 2009, oil price had dropped to $45/barrel. Treating this price as the midpoint of the cycle results in normalized operating income of -6,395 + 911.32($45) = $34,614

- Using a return on (new) capital of  $21 \%$ growth rate of  $2 \%$ , marginal tax rate of  $35 \%$ , and CoC of  $9.44 \%$ results in enterprise value of $279.05bn and equity value of $301.66bn:

Value of operating assets =

$$
= \frac {\text {O p e r a t i n g I n c o m e} (1 + g) (1 - \text {t a x r a t e}) (1 - \frac {g}{R O C})}{(\text {C o s t o f c a p i t a l} - g)} = \frac {3 4 . 6 1 (1 . 0 2) (1 - . 3 5) (1 - \frac {. 0 2}{0 . 2 1})}{(0 . 0 9 4 4 - 0 . 0 2)} = \$ 2 7 9. 0 5 b i l l i o n
$$

- Subtracting net debt to arrive at equity value:

Value of equity = Value of operating assets + cash - debt

$$
= \$ 2 7 9. 0 5 + \$ 3 2. 0 1 - \$ 9. 4 = \$ 3 0 1. 6 6 b i l l i o n
$$

- After this adjustment, Exxon's market cap of $320bn seems reasonable

# Volatility of DCF value and FCF

- For a cyclical company, a time series of DCF values should exhibit lower volatility than earnings and cash flows: Why?

EXHIBIT 33.1 The Long-Term View: Free Cash Flow and DCF Volatility

# Cyclical valuations

- Looking at price and EPS path illustrates why multiples expand and contract
- Still, share prices of cyclical companies tend to be more volatile than what DCF would predict
- Potential reason: Analysts and investors do not fully adjust for the cycle

# Cyclical valuations (cont.)

- Possible explanation: Anchoring on current earnings
Cognitive biases in forecasting

- Anchoring: We (humans) use readily available "anchors" as a starting point when creating forecasts
- Cognitive psychology has shown that people insufficiently adjust forecasts from this anchor
- Recall: Pre-recording on Fundamentals of Forecasting

# Potential solutions

- "Normalized" numbers or multiples:
- Base value on a "normalized" level of profits (e.g., not the peak or trough)
– Ask: What earnings, reinvestment and cash flow a company would generate in a normal year?

Essentially use mid-point of the cycle (see Exxon example)

- "Adaptive growth"
- Since cycles can last for long periods, normalization may take a long time
- "Compromise" solution:
- Assume normalization in the long-term (i.e., for TV)
- Allow earnings/cash flows to follow the current cycle for the short term
- Then, fade growth rate to normalized value for TV
- This essentially is a three-stage valuation model (recall Week 1)
- Scenario analysis
- Create scenarios for different trends

# Scenario analysis

- This approach avoids a single forecast and allows exploration of a wider range of outcomes and their implications
- For example: Use scenarios to develop at least two cycles:

-A "normal cycle" based on long-term trends of profits and ROIC
- A new trend line scenario based on a recent trend line
- Steps:
- Construct and value the normal cycle scenario, using information about past cycles
- Construct and value a new trend scenario based on company's recent performance
- Develop economic rationale for each of the two scenarios
- Assign probabilities to the scenarios using the economic rationale
- Combine by computing the expected value

Housing downturn proves short and shallow with a sharp recovery. SSS +MSD in 2024. Majority of pricing holds leading to record margins and profits. Sherwin's multiple holds in recognition of through the cycle pricing/eps power. Home improvement robust and weather and painter availability accommodative. DIY up MSD in 2024+ and Perf.

# BASE CASE

\~25x \~\\(12'24eEPS

2H guidance still looks conservative on volume, price and COGS, though it is also fair to say that order book uncertainty remains and that hurricane season awaits. Nonetheless, we think the bear case has become both less scary and less probable while the discussion of $12-14 of EPS power is back to being a question of "when" rather than "if". Assuming housing macro data continues to bottom out and the US Fed is closer to pausing than not, we expect investor sentiment to continue to improve.

# $300.00

# BEAR CASE

# $225.00

~25x 2023 Bear Case EPS of ~$9

Raw material reversion and less soft landing for pro paint demand. A rough hurricane season reverses deflation (at least temporarily), residential repaint demand does not hold up as well as expected, and housing starts turn negative again. Sherwin backs off of some of the amped up SG&A spend as an offset but still comes in below its 2Q23 guidance raise.

# Westlake Case

# Case questions

- Understanding Westlake operations
- How do they create value?
- How are they affected by price volatility and industry cycle?
- What are the key risks for their business?
- Impact of the cycle
- Is the current situation good or bad news for its future performance?
- Forecast future EPS at peak of cycle
- Forces you to think about the impact of the cycle
- Would you use this estimate in a forward PE multiple?
- Connects it to valuation

# Terminal Value Considerations

# Inflation

- With nominal forecasting, expected inflation is embedded in the forecasts
- Your growth forecasts reflect your inflation expectations
- Individual line-items can increase above or below the general inflation rate
- In high inflation environments, it can make sense to forecast in real terms
- Discuss more in Week 8
- Nominal forecasting also applies to growth rate in TV (e.g., in constant growth formula)
- It should include (or account for) inflation
- If  $g$  in terminal value is set equal to inflation rate, do I still need new investment?

# Maintenance vs. new investment

- How do we capture replacement investments in the TV?
- Implicit assumption is that replacing existing assets allows the company to maintain its status quo
- Not always obvious
- Think about the energy transition and car companies
- Would simply replacing existing manufacturing capabilities be enough?
- "Maintenance" investment is not just required for fixed assets

– Think about keeping existing clients in a subscription business

# Selecting the length of the forecast horizon

- What have you used in the past? Or what do you see in analyst reports?
- Forecast horizon length is often recommended to be the time over which the firms is expected to achieve a 'steady state'
- In steady state, we have constant growth, constant profitability, constant investment rate, etc.
- We can then apply simple perpetuities
- In principle, you can pick an arbitrary forecast horizon
- Multiples have very short forecast horizons
- Hard part is to adjust the FCF accordingly

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e65e72f2-451a-4831-b786-a564ab73d9de/f0c4ee6d2118973e1e6e70a8b1841fd6509e34564e8191245902385b04fa4f38.jpg)

$\%$

# Selecting the length of the forecast horizon (cont.)

- Ideally, the trajectory of forecasts shows growth rates that gradually diminish over the forecast horizon, rather than drop abruptly in the terminal value year – Why diminish?
- You can partition the model into several sub-periods with different assumptions regarding growth and returns on investment
- ROIC at the end of the forecast horizon should be sustainable given expected competition, industry conditions, etc.
- Ultimately, the key problem is not the length of forecast horizon but to determine normalized FCF (or economic profit) in steady state

# Recall: Three-stage model

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/e65e72f2-451a-4831-b786-a564ab73d9de/f79865d3ceff1ede5910ffa3ec0f0753c238a2ada1e5e1126eab4c3f7669aabf.jpg)

Time segment

- Forecast period 1
- Forecast period 2

TV period

- Use varying levels of detail
- Line-items, then key drivers and fading, then TV perpetuity
- Three-stage model fades the FCF to sustainable level before using perpetuity
- Use value-driver formula to implement: FCF(1+g)/WACC-g
- With a short forecast horizon, you have to work hard on normalization of  $\mathsf{FCF}_{\mathsf{T} + 1}$

Note in this model, the analyst does not normalize for growth in 2035E:  $\mathrm{FCF}_{\mathrm{T} + 1} = 3,616,092 = \mathrm{FCF}_{\mathrm{T}} * (1 + \mathrm{g}) = 3,477,012 * 1.04$

# Terminal value: FCF estimate (numerator)

- You need to spend time on the FCF in your terminal value calculation
- $\mathsf{FCF}_{\mathsf{T} + 1} = \mathsf{FCF}$  in the year after the (explicit) forecast horizon
- This is a critical step and often forgotten
- This issue is similar to the problem of adjusting 'E' in PE ratios
- How do you estimate  $\mathsf{FCF}_{\mathsf{T} + 1}$ ?
- Adjust Sales $_{T+1}$  to mid cycle
- Use sustainable operating profit margin (industry analysis)
- Use sustainable long-term tax rate (tax credits rarely last forever)
- Do not forget replacement investments:
- As otherwise how could the firm continue to exist in perpetuity
- This is why it is a good idea to extend the forecast horizon: It helps you forecast a "normalized" operating profit and the necessary investments

Value

=

$$
\mathrm {N O P A T} \times \left[ 1 - \frac {g}{R O N I C} \right]
$$

$$
W A C C - g
$$

- We can show:  $\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{{RONIC}} =$  (re)investment rate (IR) in steady state (see Appendix)
- Intuitively: The larger  $g$  and the smaller the RONIC, the larger the fraction of NOPAT that needs to be reinvested

# Relation between growth and investment

$$
\text {C o n t i n u i n g V a l u e} _ {t} = \frac {\mathrm {N O P A T} _ {t + 1} \left(1 - \frac {g}{\mathrm {R O N I C}}\right)}{\mathrm {W A C C} - g}
$$

Allows for adjustment of long-run profits

- Distinction between RONIC and ROIC (new vs. existing invested capital)
- Fundamental relation between growth and investment:

$$
R e i n v e s t m e n t r a t e = \frac {G r o w t h r a t e (s t a b l e)}{R e t u r n o n c a p i t a l (s t a b l e)}
$$

- Common mistake is to forecast revenue and earnings growth without considering the investment necessary to support such growth:

1. $\mathrm{TV} = \mathrm{FCF}_{\mathrm{T} + 1} / (\mathrm{WACC - g}) = \mathrm{FCF}_{\mathrm{T}} * (1 + \mathrm{g}) / (\mathrm{WACC - g})$
2. $\mathrm{TV} = \mathrm{FCF}_{\mathrm{T} + 1} / (\mathrm{WACC - g}) = \mathrm{NOPAT}_{\mathrm{T}} / (\mathrm{WACC - g})$

- No. 1: High reinvestment rate in T that is not adjusted to lower growth in TV

TV is too small (see earlier Zoom example)

- No. 2: Positive growth rate without new net investment
TV is too large (my point on slide re inflation)

# Growth and investment: Example

- Example: Valuing high-growth company
- 20% growth rate for next 5 years and 4% thereafter
- Year 0: $10MM in NOPAT (after-tax operating income)
- Current re-investment of $1MM (year 0)

So re-investment rate = 10% (of NOPAT)

- 10% cost of capital
- Do you think the reinvestment rate is reasonable?

# Appendix

# Illustrating why reinvestment rate = g/RONIC

- Illustration of why:  $\frac{\Delta NOA_{T+1}}{NOPAT_{T+1}} = \frac{NETINVESTMENT_{T+1}}{NOPAT_{T+1}} = \frac{g}{RONIC}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} F C F = N O P A T - N E T I N V E S T M E N T \\ = N O P A T ^ {*} \left(1 - \frac {N E T I N V E S T M E N T}{N O P A T}\right) \\ \end{array}
$$

" (re-)investment rate"

- If investment rate is constant beyond forecast horizon and RONIC is constant, then FCF will grow at the same constant rate as NOPAT
- Let  $g$  be growth rate in NOPAT (and FCF)
- For any future year s (multiply and divide by net investment):

$$
\begin{array}{l} g = N E T I N V E S T M E N T _ {S} \cdot \frac {N O P A T _ {S + 1} - N O P A T _ {S}}{N E T I N V E S T M E N T _ {S}} \div N O P A T _ {S} \\ = N E T I N V E S T M E N T _ {S} \cdot R O N I C \div N O P A T _ {S} \\ \Rightarrow \frac {g}{R O N I C} = \frac {N E T I N V E S T M E N T _ {S}}{N O P A T _ {S}} \\ \end{array}

# Westlake Chemical

- Case is set in October 2004 when natural gas prices showed three years of high volatility
- Industry appears to be nearing a peak in its cycle
- Westlake is a vertically integrated chemical producer of petrochemicals
- Analyst Kevin McCarthy is the top-ranked chemical industry analyst at the time – He wants to forecast Westlake's EPS at the peak of the cycle
- Analysts use "peak EPS" (or "full-cycle EPS") in their valuation multiples for cyclical companies
- Example: "Based on a 7.5 multiple of  $4.10 in peak EPS, we are raising our target price from$ 28 to $31 and maintaining our Outperform rating." (Credit Suisse on Westlake, 11/3/2004)

# Case questions

- Understanding Westlake operations
- How do they create value?
- How are they affected by price volatility and industry cycle?
- What are the key risks for their business?
- Impact of the cycle (and volatility)
- Is the current situation good or bad news for its future performance?
- Forecast future EPS at peak of cycle
- Makes you to think about the impact of the cycle
- Would you use this earnings estimate in a forward PE multiple?
- Connects it to valuation

# Westlake's operations

# Operations

- Ethane, produced from natural gas, is the primary raw material for all of its products
- Its main products are olefins and vinyls

- How does Westlake add value?
- It is a commodity pure play; low-cost producer; little R&D
- Price taker in inputs and outputs
- Adds value via operational efficiency and via careful management of capacity relative to the business cycle

# Summary – Industry analysis and key risks

- Natural gas price volatility as a risk?
- It is not clear that input volatility is a major risk
- Westlake achieved modest EPS growth in 2003 and 1H2004 despite increased natural gas prices

It seems able to pass along price changes to customers

- However, the relative pricing of oil and gas is potentially a risk because WL's facilities mainly use gas

Cyclicality and capacity utilization

- Margins are critical for forecasting (not topline, which reflects price vola)
- Margins are cyclical and related to capacity utilization
- Current situation is "good" leading to margin expansion
- Other risks
- Highly volatile bottom-line (and high leverage) = financial risk
- Westlake is still a smaller player in very competitive industry (4% of production capacity of ethylene and PVC)
- High competition may push margins lower in the longer run

# Forecasting "peak EPS"

- The after-tax margin on ethylene (Exhibit 9, Panel B) means a  $0.01/pound increase in margin for ethylene provides an additional$ 0.28/share to EPS (after tax), referred to as "EPS leverage"
- Thus, as shown in column 2 below, the  $0.074/pound increase in margin for ethylene (at peak) provides an additional$ 2.11/share to after-tax EPS

(1) Calculated using 64.9MM shares outstanding as of September 2004

(2) This column shows how Exh 9 Panel B arrives at pre-tax increase above. Panel B calculates how a $0.01/lb change in cash margin affects EPS

(3) Note because of the equivalence of pounds and $ per share ("capacity" and "pre-tax increase" columns), you could also compute "after-tax increase in EPS" by multiplying "after-tax increase" x "inc/dec in margin" x 100. In this case, you don't need to multiply with (1-t) as you already use "after-tax increase"

(4) Given we are forecasting EPS, we should adjust the 2003 EPS for non-recurring items. This 2003 adj. EPS takes the actual 2003 net income (\$15M), subtracts the gain on legal settlement (\$3M) and adds back debt retirement cost (\$11M), divided by weighted shares outstanding (49.5M) used in calculating 2003 EPS

# Would you use "peak EPS" in a forward PE multiple?

- Multiples change over the cycle: "peak EPS" and "trough EPS"
- Used in valuation multiples for cyclical and commodity companies
- Recall example: "Based on a 7.5 multiple of  $4.10 in peak EPS, we are raising our target price from$ 28 to $31 and maintaining our Outperform rating." (Credit Suisse on Westlake, 11/3/2004)
- Cycle has impact on margins and hence profits, but peak profits are not sustained
- Thus, multiples could use long-run (through-the-cycle) average for profits
- Alternatively, use peak and adjust the multiple
- Remember at the peak, multiples tend to contract (see also slide truck OEM)

# Final Q: Why did we use entire ethylene production?

- Westlake uses most of its Ethylene production as an input for other products
- In the calculation of peak EPS, we used the entire ethylene production (2,800 million pounds), rather than the amount sold externally
- Does this amount to double counting?
- The gross margins in Exhibit 9, Panel C are essentially incremental gross margins for each product
- In a highly competitive market, production that is used internally is likely priced at market rates
- Thus, Westlake also earns a margin increase for production used as an input

There is no double counting

- The increase in ethylene price/margin means that input prices for the other products increase
- Thus, what happens to their margins depends on their respective output (and input) price increases
- The calculation computes margin increases along the value chain

# Epilogue

- Despite high and volatile input prices, Westlake performed well in 2004 and 2005
- This was primarily due to high demand and high capacity utilization throughout the industry, which meant margin increases and ability to pass through input price increases – Price-taking commodity firms can do well even with increasing input prices

# Equity compensation in high-growth companies

- ESOs align management interests with shareholders
- Options protect managers and employees on the downside
- Counteracts their risk aversion and rewards risk-taking
- Young and high-growth firms are often short on cash
- ESOs allow cash-poor firms with growth prospects to compete for talent
- As a consequence, ESOs are highly used in high-growth companies

# Employee stock options

- Employee stock options, like warrants, conversion options on bonds, etc.
- Give holders rights to purchase shares at prices possibly different from intrinsic value or current price (often much below)
- A transfer of wealth between existing and new shareholders
- Clearly, such claims will impact a valuation, but estimating how much is difficult

Exercise depends on future stock price

- Simple (and correct) approach is not available due to contingent nature
- We need option pricing approach (e.g., Black-Scholes model)
- If stock options are used by a firm to compensate employees, two issues need to be considered to avoid overvaluing common stock:
- Cash-equivalent cost of future stock option grants
- Value of employee stock options outstanding on valuation date
- Valuation of future grants and outstanding options should be considered if the firm is a heavy user of stock compensation

# Basic accounting recap for stock compensation

- In 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, which requires firms to treat the fair value of granted options as compensation expense, with the expense taken over vesting period
- To expense the cost of an option, the firm must determine the option's value
- Value typically determined using an option pricing model (e.g., Black-Scholes)
- Should adjust model to reflect vesting requirements and the fact that ESOs are generally not transferable
- Accounting for ESOs hinges on the grant date, vesting period, and exercise date
- Grant date: Value of the grant is measured but expense is not recorded immediately
- Vesting period: Compensation expense is recorded over the vesting period
- Reduces earnings | increases paid-in capital from options
- Exercise date
- Upon exercise, firm receives cash for the exercise price and issues shares
- Records cash and paid-in capital from common stock | removes paid-in capital from options

# Basic accounting recap for stock compensation (cont.)

- Example: Suppose Firm A grants 10MM ESOs with an exercise price of $50 on 12/31/2005 when Firm A's stock price was $50. On that date, Firm A uses an option pricing model to determine the fair value of these ESOs at $30 each. The ESOs fully vest in 4 years. All the ESOs are exercised on 12/31/2011; Firm A's stock price was $120 at that time.

# Dealing with future grants

- Cash-equivalent cost of future stock option grants :
- Compensation expense associated with stock option grants (and other equity-based pay) is usually buried within SGA and/or CGS
- Stock option expense is added back in cash flow statement as a non-cash expense, analogous to add-back for depreciation in computation of FCF
- But you should treat the stock compensation expense 'as if' it were a cash expense in the computation of future FCF
- Accounts for share value that will be handed over to employees in the future
- In essence, you use past stock compensation expense as a proxy for future stock compensation and include it in the FCF as a cash-equivalent
- Do not add it back to FCF!
- What do many analysts do?
- Treat is as a non-cash expense and add it back (wrong)
- Divide by fully-diluted shares (only relevant for existing options)

Here, the analyst added stock-based compensation in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA but subtracted it again in the calculation of FCF for valuation

# Dealing with past grants

- Value of employee stock options outstanding on valuation date:
- Need to be valued separately
- Again, this is different from the value of future grants
- Here, we account for the value that has already been given to managers
- Fair value of vested outstanding employee options and the portion of unvested options that are expected to vest (i.e., not be forfeited due to turnover), net of tax corporate benefits, should be subtracted from enterprise value
- Use an option valuation model
- Use Black-Scholes to estimate value of outstanding options as of valuation date
- Black-Scholes assumptions are typically disclosed in the footnotes
- See Canvas for Excel sheet to do the valuation

# ESO – Incorrect but relatively easy approach

Exercise value approach (to value options outstanding)

- Assume in-the-money outstanding that are vested options were to be exercised immediately
- Add total proceeds from such an exercise to enterprise value (plus tax benefits of tax deduction for amounts employees will report in income)
- Divide total estimated equity value by [# shares actually outstanding + # shares issued from assumed exercise]
- See Exhibit 14.5 in Koller et al. (p. 333)
- Understands true value of options outstanding because:
- Ignores unvested outstanding options that are expected to vest in future
- Ignores time value of options (options may go further in money between now and maturity), so options are worth more than 'intrinsic value'

This could be a reasonable approach if the valuation is for a firm to be acquired

- After acquisition, all in-the-money outstanding options are typically exercised immediately

- At fiscal year end, Microsoft's (current) stock price was $80

- Considering all outstanding options causes the overhang to grow considerably
- Note this approach still ignores potential stock price increases
- Need proper option valuation approach

- The tax benefit highlighted in yellow is what you divide by the value of the options exercised (i.e., tax deduction) to obtain  $T_{\text{ESO}} - \ln 2000:5535 / 15814 = 35\%$
- In 2000:  $5535 / 15814 = 35\%$
- Note: Stock option tutorial on Canvas uses  $35 \%$ , but you can change it to current rate or firm-specific rate

# Summary for ESO treatment

- Computation of equity value is reduced by both:

1. Cash equivalent cost (net of tax) of future option grants:

- Incorporated into calculation of future free cash flows
- Tax benefits need to be captured like tax benefits of interest

2. Value of outstanding stock options, net of tax benefit

- Value of outstanding options *  $(1 - T_{\text{ESO}})$
- Calculation includes vested options and the portion of unvested outstanding options that are expected to vest
- Note: This already incorporates future tax benefits of exercising currently outstanding options, so we can ignore calculating these future tax benefits when calculating future free cash flows
- Technically, you have to use your equity valuation and not the market value, which creates circularity
- Effect is small unless your valuation is far from market value

# Restricted Stock Units

- A restricted stock unit is a promise to issue a share of stock to an employee, usually at no cost to the employee, upon completion of a vesting period
- They have become much more popular since the introduction of stock option expensing under FAS 123R
- The accounting for restricted stock unit is essentially the same as for ESOs
- Value of the RSU is expensed over the vesting period
- Firm receives income tax deduction when RSU vests (for fair value at vesting date)
- The valuation implications are also similar as ESOs
- We need to consider future grants in the FCFs (exactly like ESOs)
- We need to value and subtract the value of already granted RSUs

$$
E Q U I T Y P E R S H A R E = \frac {V}{S + n (1 - \tau)}
$$

- $V =$  combined value of common equity and RSUs (which is equal to core operations plus non-operating assets less all other capital claims)
- n = number of RSUs outstanding at the valuation date
$\boldsymbol{\tau} =$  marginal income tax rate
- S = number of shares outstanding at the valuation date

# Appendix

# Details on Black-Scholes model

- Value of call options without dividends:

$$
- C = P * N \left(d _ {1}\right) - X e ^ {- r t} * N \left(d _ {2}\right)
$$

- Value of call options with dividends:

$$
- C = P * e ^ {- y t} * N \left(d _ {1}\right) - X e ^ {- r t} * N \left(d _ {2}\right)
$$

- Note: Can adjust the Black-Scholes value for dilution effect by multiplying the balance sheet value by the so-called warrant conversion factor:

# Tax benefits from ESOs

- Stock options can provide tax benefits to the company (upon exercise)
- Calculate Enterprise Value - ([Estimated net value of options] x (1-t $_{ESO}$ ))

Question: What is  $t_{\text{ESO}}$ ?

- Tax rate at which firm receives tax benefits from options
Depends on firm's tax position and the mix of qualified vs. nonqualified options
- $T_{\text{ESO}}$  varies between 0 and marginal tax rate, depending on mix of options

Tax benefit: Non-qualified stock option

$$
\begin{array}{l} = (\text {m a r g i n a l} \quad \text {t a x} \quad \text {r a t e}) ^ {*} (S _ {E} - X) \\ S _ {E} = \text {s t o c k p r i c e o n e x e c i s e d a t e} \\ X = \text {s t r i k e p r i c e} \\ S _ {E} - X = \$ \text {g a i n t o e m p l e y e e f o r e x e r c i s i n g o n e} \\ F i r m s \mathrm {t a x} \mathrm {d e d u c t i o n} = \$ \mathrm {g a i n} \mathrm {t o} \mathrm {e l p e y e e} \\ \end{array}

# Today

- Difficulties of valuing young and high-growth companies
- As in Week 3, we have to be careful about using the past
- How are we dealing with high growth?
- Approaches to high growth and uncertainty
- Backward induction
- Scenario analysis
- How to value executive stock compensation (pre-recording)
- Netflix valuation (Case)
- Accounting shenanigans in young and growth companies
- Why do firms manage their numbers?

# Valuation Challenges

# Difficulties of valuing young & high growth companies

- Short history & rapid growth
- Not much history of financial data to use as an input for forecasting

Historical financial results provide little guidance on future prospects

- Very difficult to determine reasonable growth rates for uncharted territory
- Numbers are volatile (e.g., shifting margins)
- Often report losses in recent past or even since incorporation
- Losses might continue in the foreseeable future
- In many cases, these companies lack comparable firms
- Belong to a nascent industry
- New product or service
- Other issues:
- Stock compensation & convertible securities
– Voting and non-voting shares (cover in Week 7)

# Key forecasting issues

- Common to use current numbers as a base
- For young, high-growth firms, these numbers can be very small & not meaningful
- Recall two key themes:
- It is a firm's economic profit in the long-run that really matters
- Mean reversion & competition
- Two important questions:
- When will growth level off and the firm become more stable?
- What will the firm look like at that point and what will it earn?
- The TV is close or even more than  $100\%$  of firm value (i.e., losses)
- The irony is that the TV calculation matters more for growth firms, even though we have less solid data and information

# Key forecasting issues (cont.)

What percentage of firms grew sales at a CAGR of  $20 - 25\%$  for three years?

- Sales growth often declines fast
- Double-digit growth requires substantial investments
- Fuzzy lines between operating expenses & capital expenditures (or investment)

Building the business is an investment

- We will drill deeper on this issue in Week 5 (related to intangibles)
- It can help to compute market value-implied rates for key forecasts
- Reverse-engineering exercise (as in the Netflix case)
- The idea is to understand what is already priced and to evaluate if implied forecasts are plausible
- Visible Alpha might give you a sense too

# Common valuation practices

- Analysts often discard DCF approach and use multiples instead
- They note that DCF is too difficult and assumptions just too subjective
- Growth heavily influences the multiples
- Post-pandemic tech multiples:

<table><tr><td>Ticker</td><td>Name</td><td>FY 2021 Equity Value ($MM)</td><td>FY 2021 Enterprise Value ($MM)</td><td>FY 20-21 Rev growth</td><td>FY 2021 EV / Sales</td><td>FY 2021 EV / EBITDA</td><td>FY 2021 P/E</td><td>FY 2021 M/B</td></tr><tr><td>GOOGL</td><td>Alphabet</td><td>1,921,855</td><td>1,797,136</td><td>41%</td><td>7.0</td><td>19.7</td><td>25.8</td><td>7.6</td></tr><tr><td>AMZN</td><td>Amazon</td><td>1,691,003</td><td>1,675,338</td><td>22%</td><td>3.6</td><td>28.3</td><td>51.5</td><td>12.3</td></tr><tr><td>META</td><td>Meta</td><td>935,645</td><td>888,228</td><td>37%</td><td>7.5</td><td>16.2</td><td>24.4</td><td>7.4</td></tr><tr><td>NFLX</td><td>Netflix</td><td>267,461</td><td>276,826</td><td>19%</td><td>9.3</td><td>14.9</td><td>56.4</td><td>16.9</td></tr><tr><td>SNAP</td><td>Snap</td><td>75,709</td><td>74,269</td><td>64%</td><td>18.0</td><td>--</td><td>--</td><td>20.1</td></tr><tr><td>TSLA</td><td>Tesla</td><td>1,061,287</td><td>1,051,808</td><td>66%</td><td>19.5</td><td>111.8</td><td>215.6</td><td>36.2</td></tr></table>

- Given negative profit measures, analysts use sales multiples (EV/sales)
- Sales multiples ignore differences in margins (or shifts over time)
- Investors often start using "innovative" multiples: e.g.,
- Eyeballs, clicks, oil reserves
- Not necessarily tied to value drivers or "economics"

# Common valuation practices

- Recall Week 1 (bubbles) and Week 2 (behavioral biases)
- Herding and "fear of missing out"
- Representativeness & overconfidence
- Using a forward base together with high multiple potentially double counts growth
- True, DCF model requires assumptions for the value drivers: revenue growth, margins, (re)investment rates, cost of capital, etc.
- Using multiples does not make these assumptions go away
- Moves the problem to the base of the multiple & finding comparable firms
- The main difference is that DCF makes the assumptions explicit

# Defending DCF (or economic profit) models

- Making assumptions explicit and constructing DCF model is insightful
- A robust DCF model does not necessarily get it "right", but it explains what needs to happen to support a particular value
- Provides insights into business model and key value drivers that support the valuation
- Explicit assumptions allow analysts to create different scenarios
- Probabilistic thinking is especially useful on young companies
- Survival can be a key risk
- For young companies, fundamentals are more important, not less
- The point is not that you should forecast in great detail
- But you should think about value creation, competitive position, unit economics

LTG definition: The long-term growth rate represents an expected annual increase in operating earnings over the company's next full business cycle. These forecasts refer to a period of between three and five years and are expressed as a percentage. Long-term growth rate forecasts are received directly from contributing analysts; they are not calculated by Thomson Reuters

- Coincidence?
- The more bullish analysts are often the ones with shortest forecast horizons

# Snap's valuation after the quiet period

- Morgan Stanley was the lead bank in Snap's IPO
- IPO was considered a tremendous success
- Morgan Stanley published its first equity research note announcing a $28 price target for Snap's shares

–This price target was  $23 \%$ above price of previous week

- 22 hours later…

– Morgan Stanley published a second research note

- Corrected a "tax error" that led to an overstatement of adjusted EBITDA for 2021-2025 (by nearly $5 billion)
- Reduction in estimated adj. EBITDA of $1.7 billion in 2025 alone
- BUT: The target price remained at $28 – how is this possible?

# Why did the target price not change?

- Adjusted EBITDA for TV:
- Original: Adjusted EBITDA growth from final year to TV = 3.5% (consistent with assumed g in TV)
- Revision: Adjusted EBITDA growth from final year to TV = 17.4%
- Recall: Carefully analyze TV assumptions and FCF adjustment
- Cost of capital:
- Reduced Snap's equity risk premium from 5.59% to 4.29%
- Snap's WACC dropped from  $9.7\%$  to  $8\%$
- However, other banks used WACCs well above  $8\%$  (or even  $9.7\%$ )
- These changes balance out the "tax error"
- Made just to generate the same price target?
-In fairness: MS price target is similar to other banks

- Link back to Week 1: Can we trust the valuation of a bank with an interest in the success of an IPO?

# Valuation Process

# How to deal with high revenue growth?

- Draw on a number of sources to estimate revenue growth on young companies:
- Firms' own growth rate
- Growth rate of overall market that the firm serves
- Use path of growth rates from other high-growth companies
- Base rate book (Canvas)
- Could model steady decay from past growth rates
- Idea is to approximate mean reversion
- Imposes an 'outside' view
- See next slide: Amazon in 1998 as an example
- Other techniques:
- Start with the future and go backwards: Estimate long-run value drivers
- Use scenarios

# Amazon in 1998: Fading sales growth over time

- Revenue growth of  $800\%$  from 1996-1997 and  $300\%$  from 1997-1998
- You could assume continued high growth but fade estimates over time

# Tech firms often have life cycle compression

# Tech firm life cycle

Tech companies don't have long "mature" periods, where the get to live off the fat, because disruption is always around the corner.

# Non-tech firm life cycle

Non-tech companies get longer "mature" period, where they get to milk their cash cows.

Tech companies are able to climb the growth ladder faster because their growth requires less investment and their products are more likely to be accepted quickly by consumers.

Non-tech companies take longer to grow, partly because they need more investment to grow and partly because consumer inertia (attachment to existing products) is more deeply set.

Non-tech companies decline over long periods and may even find ways to live on as smaller, more focused versions of their original selves. If that is not feasible, they will have assets to liquidate.

Tech companies also have more precipitous declines from grace, for the same reason that they climbed so fast, i.e. new companies rise faster to take their business.

What does that mean for their TV?

# Backward induction: Start with the future

- Begin with the future and work backwards to today

– Think about what the industry might look like as the company grows

- Think about the future market
- Then work back to the present: How will the company get there?
- Stable economics probably lie 10 to 15 years into the future
- Unit economics helps a lot here
- Future state should be defined and bounded by measures of operating performance:
- TAM and customer penetration rates
- Average revenue per customer (or ARPU)
- Sustainable margins
- Remember that future growth only matters when ROIC > WACC
- So thinking about future economic profit is key

# Sizing the market

- Start by assessing how the company fulfills a customer need
- Value proposition
- Determine how the company generates (or plans to generate) revenue
- Understanding how a young company makes money is critical

Many companies build products and services that meet needs

- But it is often much less clear how to monetize the value they provide
- Then, estimate potential market (size) or TAM

By product or geography

- If the company had already launched the product or service in certain markets, use the experience and data from these early markets
- Cohort analyses

Penetration rates

Revenue per client

1 Sample of 75 publicly traded Internet start-ups, normalized to Yelp.

# Margins, capital intensity, and ROIC (or RONIC)

- To estimate long-term operating margins, remember competitive strategy:
- The larger expected or current ROIC, the higher the incentive for a competitor to enter, which in the long-run creates margin and ROIC pressures
- How can a company sustain high ROICs? Remember the moat sources
- Capital intensity (or asset turnover) depends on the business model:
- Companies often consume significant capital as they grow
- Service and internet companies require few fixed assets
- But these firms make significant investments in brands, market share, marketing, etc.
- These investments are often not capitalized (and depreciated) but expensed
- SG&A contains significant investments

Influences ROIC

- We will dig deeper into this issue in Week 5

# Valuing Stock Compensation

# Equity compensation in high-growth companies

Stock compensation is important to tool for high-growth companies

- Aligns incentives
- Young and high-growth firms are often short on cash
- ESOs allow cash-poor firms with growth prospects to compete for talent
- As a consequence, ESOs are highly used in high-growth companies

<table><tr><td>Company</td><td>% Stock Compensation of Sales</td></tr><tr><td>Yelp Inc</td><td>12.13</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter Inc</td><td>10.72</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook Inc</td><td>7.44</td></tr><tr><td>TripAdvisor Inc</td><td>7.31</td></tr><tr><td>Adobe Inc</td><td>6.75</td></tr></table>

Key points:

- You need to account for future grants and ESO/RSUs outstanding
- Simply dividing estimated value by fully diluted shares is not a good approach
- Adjusting for stock compensation is more important for multiples

# Accounting Shenanigans in High-Growth Firms

# Revenue recognition is a key area

- Major changes to the accounting rules (ASC 606)
- Particularly relevant for high tech

Under the new standards:

- Consistent principles for recognizing revenue, regardless of industry
- Identify each of the goods or services promised to a customer, and recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied
- Allocate the transaction price to each of the performance obligations in the contract on the basis of the relative standalone selling price of the underlying goods or services
- Conceptually very sound
- But: Lots of discretion

# Financial shenanigans: Relevant forces

# Double clicking' on accruals

- During the high-growth stage, investors often focus on revenue
- Could encourage management to aggressively recognize revenue
- Where would you see aggressive revenue recognition?
- Increasing accounts receivable (i.e., large accruals)

What are accruals again?

- Thus,  $\uparrow \mathrm{A} / \mathrm{R}$ , sign of aggressive recognition of revenue or channel stuffing
- Also, increasing inventory levels as a result of customer returns due to channel stuffing
- Understanding the nature of the business and how it manifests in the accounting numbers is crucial

– Deferred revenue signals increase in business but also service costs in future

- Carefully analyze revenue recognition and accruals
- Simple way to compute accruals: Accruals = Net income - CFO

# Channel stuffing at Symbol Technologies

- Symbol Technologies Inc., maker of bar code scanners, engaged in multiple types of shenanigans, including channel stuffing
- When Symbol's business was slowing and it seemed Wall Street targets would not be met, Symbol shipped products to customers early (w/o their approval) to inflate revenue
- Classic shenanigan: Early revenue recognition
- Typically involves retailers or distributors (as customers)
- The company even "sold" products to customers in order to record revenue, and then repurchased the goods at a higher price
- Channel stuffing and aggressive revenue recognition led to an increase in days of receivables from 80 in June 2000 to 119 days in June 2001
- To avoid investor concerns, Symbol cosmetically moved accounts receivable to notes receivable by turning some of the A/R into (longer-term) promissory loans
- Customers returned shipments
- To cover up the build-up in inventory, Symbol created an "inventory reduction plan" that recorded fictitious accounting entries to reduce inventory, left product returns on docks without recording as inventory, and sold inventory to third party but agreed to repurchase it

This decision not only overstates revenue

It excludes important elements of the cost structure from contribution (or gross) margin

Effect on revenue: -15%

- Contribution margin goes from  $42.7\%$  to  $11.3\%$  (of revenues);  $11.3\%$  to  $3\%$  (of bookings)

# Boosting CF from operations

- Given the concerns about revenue recognition incentives, analysts carefully analyze CF from operations (CFO)
- See analysis for MicroStrategy
- This in turn creates incentives to boost the CFO or 'play with' CF classifications
- Broader message:

– Deep in 10-K you can often find extra information on the drivers of CFO

- Non-recurring boosts to CFO are often not broken out in cash flow statement

Thus, when you spot one-time benefits to earnings, ask how they affect CFO

- Example: Sun Microsystems

– Received $2 billion from Microsoft in 2004 as settlement income

- However on the cash flow statement, this $2 billion was lumped into the "Net income" line of cash flow from operations
– By not splitting the settlement income out, it looks like that \(2 billion is recurring operating cash flow

- Epitome of a growth stock
- Discuss NFLX at two major strategy pivots

Part 1 set in Feb 2011

– Share price had risen substantially over previous year

- Netflix made major strategic changes (streaming, start of international)
- Reverse-engineering exercise
- What do you have to assume to justify price in Feb 2011?
- Focus on key drivers to reduce degrees of freedom

# Netflix in 2011: Major strategy changes

- After expanding into streaming in 2007, Netflix decided in 2011 to pursue streaming as its core business

– Split DVD and streaming such that if subscribers wanted both, they had to pay for two separate accounts, effectively increasing the monthly price by  $60 \%$

- Heightened competition by players such as Google (via YouTube) and Amazon
- Netflix may not be as well positioned for "content wars" due to its smaller scale
- Starting in September 2010, Netflix was expanding internationally

– Relatively higher LatAm pricing may narrow total addressable market

- High customer acquisition cost at the outset while Netflix builds brand awareness
- Analysts were divided on whether Netflix could succeed as streaming business
- On one hand, Netflix's 20MM subscriber base, customer loyalty, and existing relationships with content providers could help Netflix succeed
- On the other, focus on streaming posed challenges to its (old) business model

# Part I: What do you have to assume to justify price?

- Reverse engineering is a very useful exercise generally
- Focus on a few key drivers to reduce degrees of freedom
- We fixed the terminal value assumptions for you
- Our assumptions (for illustration only – many possibilities here):
- Assume growth in average number of paying subscribers declines over time (roughly -3%) until it reaches  $3 \%$ in TV
- Given historical decline in average monthly revenue per paying subscriber, we assume average monthly revenue continues to decline until it reaches $9, after which it grows with inflation (2%)
- Modeled EBITDA margin (incl. all operating costs) and assumed slight improvement
- As Netflix shifts more into streaming, expect the content to be amortized over a longer life and thus assume D&A as % of capex and total content investments to decline over time
- As Netflix grows its subscriber base, assume it can spread its content investments over the larger base so forecast decline in capex and content investments as % of revenue over time

Economies of scale or operating leverage

- For net working capital, we assume that Netflix continues to generate (rather than consumes) cash due its subscription-based business model

- Note that numerator in CV (1,334) is much lower than NOPAT in T60 (2,287) – Why? Reinvestment to grow

NFLX made massive content investments

- Total asset turnover (incl. content) dropped significantly
- No operating leverage (largely due to shift into original content)
- It grew much faster than we needed to assume to justify $240
- Big jump in 2017 was the international expansion
NFLX was much less profitable than we assumed in our model
- ROIC and RNOIC are now fairly close

# Part I: What did we learn from the exercise?

- Although TV assumptions were fixed, your assumptions and forecasts over the next 10 years still matter
- They determine the FCF at  $T + 1$  that goes into the terminal value calculation
- Growth assumptions you had to make to justify $240 were not unreasonable
- You could even build some decline into the revenue per subscriber and still get to current price if you kept margins flat and assumed some operating leverage in content investments

Note that decline in revenue per subscriber did not materialize in reality (or actuals)

- But such a decline was not unreasonable given other competitors (Disney+, HBO Max) entered the streaming market. However, not clear that this was forecastable in 2011
- Content spending (for FCF) and amortization (for profitability and ROIC) were very important assumptions
- Without some leverage or scale economies in content spending, it was hard to justify price (unless you forecasted some margin improvement, e.g., higher ARPU)

Note the parallels to 2017 MoffettNathanson report

- Some operating leverage on purchased (fixed-priced content) not unreasonable
- In 2011, the large expansion in original content was probably not foreseeable, but after 2017 much of the discussion centered on this issue

# Part I: What did we learn from the exercise?

- In our proposed solution, we had small EBITDA margin improvement
- It is not unreasonable to assume some margin improvement as they can also spread operating expenses (e.g., marketing) over larger base
- This assumption is less clear for content, which is why we focused on EBITDA
- If you forecasted a NOPAT margin, it includes depreciation and amortization
- Here the key question was again whether they would get more operating leverage from their subscription base model, spreading content investments over the larger base
- Recall (connecting case with Week 3):
- Growth requires investments (which lower FCFs)
- Growth only matters if ROIC > WACC (i.e., there is an economic profit)

# Part II: Netflix in 2017

- Questions:
- What are the key issues and major challenges in valuing Netflix in 2017?
- How does the MoffettNathanson report approach these challenges?
- Moffett Nathanson report in Feb 2017 is skeptical too
- Did a similar reverse engineering exercise
- "Can't fit our valuation methodology to current share price"

Key issues

- Maximum penetration in US market (S-curve)
- Uncertainty over international expansion (and value added)

Used cohorts

- Content spending & cash burn

List five (or four) controversies

- Interesting question: What else could they do with their platform?
- Essentially a question about TAM expansion

# Part II: Netflix in 2017 – New valuation challenges

- Future of growth in international markets?
- Difficult to assess past performance due to quick succession of international launches
- Canada in 2010, Latin America in 2011, UK & Ireland in 2012, Scandinavia in 2012, the Netherlands in 2013; expanded into 130 countries by 2016
- MoffettNathanson forecasts international in two cohorts: pre-2014 and post-2014 launch
- Increased focus on original content spending and impact on free cash flow
- Netflix shifting more and more to producing original content, which requires investment, hurting free cash flow
- MoffettNathanson forecasts a gradual improvement in FCF burn in 3-5 years but also forecasts $5bn in debt raised between 2017-2020 to support the original content spend
- How to value a "global internet TV network"?

– Valuation needs to balance high subscriber and revenue growth with free cash flow burn

- Value the domestic and the international parts separately
- MoffettNathanson uses Facebook as a comp for Netflix's domestic streaming business
International valuation is the residual after valuing the domestic part: "Is Netflix's international streaming business worth $35 billion given the operating losses?"

- They come in  $14 \%$ below market price

# Greenlight Capital (Einhorn)

- Recall: Moffett Nathanson report was written in Feb 2017
- Came in at $125
– Very close to my class at $120

- January 2017 letter put Netflix in the "bubble basket"
- Quote:

"Netflix merits a spot in the basket because its domestic market has matured; it risks an unfavorable change in net neutrality rules; and it has not demonstrated that its huge investment in original content has a positive return. NFLX is able to report that its U.S. streaming segment is highly profitable only by allocating a disproportionate amount of content amortization to its smaller and unprofitable international streaming segment."

Note: Netflix executed a seven-for-one stock split on July 15, 2015

# Epilogue (cont.)

# Netflix since 2017

- Netflix has frequently needed to raise debt to fund original content spending and global expansion
- Series of sub price increases (10% increase in Oct 2017, 13%-18% increase in May 2019) to sustain additional content investment
- January 2020: "Tale of two different businesses"
- Domestically, Netflix missed its subscriber growth forecast for the third straight quarter (423k actual vs. 600k)
- No end in sight for the content wars
- Disney launched Disney+ in November 2019 at  $\$ 7$ /month
- Internationally, Netflix leaped past its sub. forecast (8.3MM actual vs. 7MM)
- Major boost due to COVID (> 200 million subscribers)
- Early 2022: Slow subscriber growth leads to  $22\%$  decline in stock
- Since then recovered and doubled again in price

# Consequences for valuation

- Capitalization doesn't matter in steady state
- But with growth (differences), we have systematic effects on profits and assets
- Affects profitability ratios
- Accounting creates additional inconsistencies depending on firms' growth strategies
- Organic growth and self-generated assets are not capitalized
- Acquiring these assets brings them on the balance sheet
- Creates inconsistencies across peer firms

# M&A Accounting 101

# M&A accounting 101

- Once the acquisition closes, acquirer must allocate the purchase price
- Step 1 = Identify assets & liabilities @ fair value
- Identifiable acquired assets & assumed liabilities from target's balance sheet
- Identifiable intangible assets (e.g., value of brand name)
- There are likely more newly recognized intangibles (both finite-lived and infinitely-lived) for intangible-intensive targets/industries
Valuation usually done with help of external consultants

- Step 2 = Assign rest of purchase price to goodwill
- Goodwill = purchase price less identified assets & liabilities at fair value
- Goodwill is tested annually for impairment

# M&A accounting 101: Illustrative example

- Assume Big buys Little for  $50MM. Little has net assets of$ 15MM
 – Little has net assets of $15M: $5M cash, $5M A/R, $10M PPE, $5M debt
- Big determines that the value of Little's PPE should be stepped up by $5M to meet fair value of the assets
- Big identifies that Little has intangible assets worth $5M

– Therefore, Big books goodwill of $50MM – ($15MM + $5MM + $5MM) = $25MM

# History of goodwill impairment

- Goodwill used to be amortized over long horizon
- M&A transactions created permanent "earnings drag"
- One could argue the amortization assured that managers had to earn what they paid in the acquisition
- There were two ways to account for M&A transactions
- Purchase method
- Pooling of Interest method (no goodwill)
- Firms had strong preference for pooling (to avoid amortization)
- FASB eliminated pooling but stipulated that goodwill is reviewed for impairment
- More details on next slide, but involves determining if FV of goodwill declined

-In principle, good idea

- But it gives massive discretion to firms

# Goodwill write-down at Kraft Heinz

15.4 billion write down on brands

- Due to changing consumer taste

Kraft and Oscar Mayer trademarks

- Assets less valuable than at merger in 2015
- Leading to SEC reaction:
- Subpoena for policies, procedures and internal controls related to procurement
- Poor fourth quarter earnings
- $12.6 billion net loss (in fourth quarter)

-Kraft missed analysts' estimates

- Dividend cut (by 22.5 cents to 40 cents)

Key point:

- It is not goodwill per se that matters but what we learn from write-down about future of the company
- In this case, write down signaled considerable issues

# Market reaction: Kraft Heinz (shares and bonds)

# Intangible Amortization and Non-GAAP

# PE vs. EBITA multiples in pharma

- Remember: Koller et al. (Chapter 16) recommend EBITA multiple
- They exclude acquisition-related amortization from EBIT: Why?
- Makes firms that grow organically vs. through M&A more comparable
- Amortization related to other intangibles related to operations (e.g., software) should be left in EBIT

1 Consensus analyst forecast.

Schering-Plough recorded loss in 2007, so no multiple is reported.

- Forward-looking operating multiples reflect long-term prospects
- Implied growth rates and cost of capital seem fairly similar

Figure 13.1 Economic Moat Characteristics of the Healthcare Sector

Source: Morningstar.

Frequency of moats is high in health care sector

- Substantial entry barriers and start-up costs
- But moat sources depend on type of industry (within sector)

# Different health care firms and business models

Pharmaceuticals

- Tend to have (wide) moats based on intangibles (i.e., patents; usually 20 years)
- But long research and approval process implies that effective patent protection is shorter than 20 years
- Key considerations:
- Diversity of drug portfolio and patent expiry
- Development and pipeline of new drugs
Size of pharma company (e.g., funding, ability to manage and sustain long process)
- Market size (heart disease, cancer) & substitutes - disease websites (e.g., cancer.gov)
- Biotech companies (biologic drugs as opposed to be chemical)
- Tend to be smaller and riskier, more like options
- Biotech risk is often idiosyncratic
- Again, size of the market is a key consideration
- Valuation often requires decision trees or scenario analysis

It starts with the identification of a target for a drug to act on, then the identification of compounds that could potentially hit that target.</td><td>Up to 10,000 compounds considered during screening, but only around 250 will make it to preclinical testing. Efficacy and potential risks are evaluated before human trials can begin.</td><td>Clinical trials involve human participants. These tests in volunteers provide information on safety and efficacy. Around 70% of drugs succeed in phase 1, 33% in phase 2, and 25-30% in phase 3.</td><td>If a drug is deemed effective in clinical trials, it is submitted to regulating bodies to be approved.

This gives some idea of efficacy against the identified target. Toxicity can also be assessed.</td><td>The primary goal of phase 1 trials is to determine the drug&#x27;s side effects. Additionally, how quickly the drug is metabolised and excreted from the body can be determined during these trials.</td><td>The regulating body reviews the evidence provided by the pharmaceutical company for the drug&#x27;s efficacy and safety. Drugs offering important advances are given priority.</td></tr><tr><td>COMPOUND SCREENING</td><td>IN VIVO STUDIES</td><td>PHASE 2 TRIALS</td><td>APPROVAL &amp; MANUFACTURE</td></tr><tr><td>10,000+ compounds</td><td>Latin for &#x27;in the living&#x27;</td><td>Usually 100-300 people</td><td>Approx. 75% submissions approved</td></tr><tr><td>Compounds are screened in laboratory tests for their ability to affect the identified target. They are also screened to check they don&#x27;t interfere with other related targets.</td><td>Drugs that look promising in in vitro testing will progress to testing in animals. These include tests on toxicology, efficacy, and how quickly the drugs are absorbed and subsequently eliminated.</td><td>Phase 2 trials help to determine how effective the drug is in patients who have the condition it is trying to treat. Controlled trials compare the effects of the drug to that of a placebo.</td><td>If the benefits of taking the drug are deemed to outweigh its risks, it is approved. The cost of developing a drug that gains marketing approval is estimated to be $2,558 million.</td></tr><tr><td>LEAD IDENTIFICATION</td><td>REQUIRED STANDARDS</td><td>PHASE 3 TRIALS</td><td>POST-RELEASE MONITORING</td></tr><tr><td>Which compounds to test?</td><td>Min. 2 mammalian species</td><td>Usually 1,000-3,000 people</td><td>Indefinite duration</td></tr><tr><td>Though screening is unlikely to uncover a perfect drug candidate, promising compounds can be identified. The structures of these molecules can be modified to try and improve their activity.</td><td>Drugs must undergo toxicity testing on at least two mammals (one non-rodent), including at least two administration routes, before they are allowed to proceed to clinical trials in humans.</td><td>Gauges efficacy, dosage, and safety in a larger population. Also compares efficacy to existing treatments, as well as interactions with other drugs and effects of different dosages.</td><td>After a drug is approved and available for use by patients, it is still monitored for any side effects in the general population that may not have occurred in the drug&#x27;s clinical trials.</td></tr></table>

Medical device companies

- Make implantable hardware for human body
- Moat sources tend to be intellectual property (intangibles) but also physician relationships (switching costs)
- Marketing and sales force
- Training and tools for implants
- Compared to pharma, innovation tends to be more evolutionary rather than disruptive or revolutionary
Though lately pharma is characterized by lots of "me-too" drugs

- Managed care & insurance companies
- Subject to intense regulatory pressure
Economies of scale can provide cost advantages
- Network effects

# Example: Alector

- Founded in 2013, based in South San Francisco, CA
- Focuses on development of drugs to eliminate neurodegeneration (e.g., dementia, Alzheimer's) through immuno-neurology

# PRICE TARGET $27.00

Our PT is derived from a DCF through 2030E that uses a  $15\%$  discount rate and  $0\%$  terminal growth rate. The revenue drivers in our model are ALO01, ALO02/AL003. We currently do not model ALO02/003 separately given their early stage of development.

# OVERWEIGHT THESIS

Our Overweight thesis is based on successful commercialization of AL001 and AL002/AL003

AL001 is designed to treat a well defined genetic disease with a measurable biomarker compared to other neurodegenerative therapeutic approaches, driving a higher probability of success

A PhI trial in healthy volunteers demonstrated target engagement which has provided confidence it can impact the genetic disease target

# INVESTMENT DRIVERS

AL001 INFRONT PhII data in FTD-PGRN patients, expected in 1H20

AL002 PhI PoM data in Alzheimer's disease patients, expected in 2020

The Group has accounts payable financing program with certain banks when the bank repaid account payables on behalf of the Group with an equivalent sum drawn as borrowings.

During 2012, accounts payable of RMB4,961,533 thousands were repaid by the banks under this program with the equivalent amount drawn as borrowings. As at 31 December 2012, all bank borrowings related to this program were repaid.

The company appears to report borrowings as AP to boost OCF

Balance sheet shows payables increase RMB 7.7b

Cash flow statement shows RMB 12.0b increase

Reported operating cash flow of RMB 4.0b

# CF Shenanigans: Citi and Enron

- From 1998 to 2001 Citi and Enron engaged in a series of transactions to "create" operating cash inflows for Enron
- A large share of these transactions was structured as prepay transactions
- Each transaction seemingly transfers commodity risk
- Jointly, no commodity risk is transferred and Enron essentially receives a short-term loan, but it classifies the cash inflow as operating cash flow

# Importance of Intangibles

Rates of Private Nonresidential Investment in the United States, Tangible and Intangible, 1987 to 2021

- Shift from manufacturing to service & technology
- Many key assets of firms are intangibles:
- R&D and patents
- Brands and advertising
- Training and human capital investments

What makes intangibles special?

- Non-rival: Can be consumed by many
- Non-excludable: Hard to prevent the use by others
- Scalability
- Large upfront costs, few costs later (e.g., drug molecule or biologic)
- Network effects
- Sunkenness
- Tangible assets retain more resale value due to their standardization
- Spillovers
- Non rival and non excludable leads to imitation
- Synergies
- Innovation arises from combining technologies that already exist
- Intangible investments often yield extreme outcomes
- Complete loss (ROI = -100%)
High or even monopolistic profitability (ROI >> 15%)

# Accounting treatment of intangibles

- Core idea behind the accounting treatment of investments:
- Any expenditure that creates benefits over many years is an investment (or asset)
- Expenditures that generate benefits only in current year are operating expenses
- Therefore, capital expenditures for PP&E are investments
- But intangibles also generate future benefits and require capital expenditures:
- Accountants have treated these expenditures as operating expenses
- Unless they acquired in market transaction
- Acquired intangibles (e.g., via M&A, etc.) are capitalized and amortized
- Since the TCJA, IRS also requires amortization of R&D (5 years)

# Intangible investments are not just R&D

# Improper capitalization

- Improper capitalization of costs goes straight to the bottom line
- Could be used to increase profits
- American Italian Pasta Company (AIPC):
- From 2002 through 2Q04, AIPC met EPS targets due to improper capitalization
- For example, AlPC capitalized more than $10 million of internal pasta manufacturing costs as long-lived manufacturing assets
- AIPC also capitalized $1.4 million of labor costs related to internal management information systems (MIS) to long-lived IT assets
- Illustrates the concern that companies "make up" assets

# Does the market treat R&D expenditures as expenses?

- Even though many intangible investments are not capitalized, there is info in 10-K:
- R&D expenses are disclosed:
- Income statement, cash flow statement and R&D footnote
- But recall: R&D expenses can be buried in COGS and SG&A
- Academic evidence suggests that investors understand the "investment" nature of these expenditures
- Market pricing of R&D and marketing expenses is positive (but also hampered by lack of detailed information)

# OncoMed - An Example

# OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED)

- OncoMed is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel therapeutics for cancers
- In April 2019, acquired by Mereo Biopharma (no longer listed)
- Four internally discovered anti-cancer therapeutic candidates:
- Navicixizumab
- Anti-TIGIT
- GITRL-Fc
- Rosmantuzumab

Note: They had a large A/R that Celgene owed them as a result of a safety milestone in a trial. Payment in 2016 reduced assets (A/R) and hence NOA.

# OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED): Summary

- From 2011-2017 OncoMed has recorded revenue of  $222.6M and has spent$ 468.9M in R&D

– Over same period, accumulated increase in NOAs of just $72.6M

- Their financials are more affected by payments due to strategic alliances than their operations
- Cash and short-term investments represent the bulk of their assets
- No financial debt at this stage of the life-cycle
- Most of the capital is raised via equity
- Accounting numbers do not make much sense
- In 2016, OncoMed reports negative NOA
- Very low (or even negative) reinvestment rates (as a percentage of revenue)
– This contrasts with the high R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue

# Consequences for financial analysis & valuation

- How does  $\underline{\mathrm{Lack}}$  of capitalization affect profits and ROIC?
- Effect on profit depends on growth
- Regardless, book value/invested capital is understated
- Thus, ROIC is overstated
- How does lack of capitalization affect valuation?

-In principle, no effect on DCF or Economic Profit models

- Cash flows are not affected
- So why do we care?
- Capitalization can influence your view of true economic profitability (and hence your forecasting)
- Link between investments and value creation (future benefits)

# Consequences for financial analysis & valuation (cont.)

- Relative valuation and terminal value calculations become even trickier:
- Reinvestment is buried in operating expenses
- Recall: Reinvestment is a function of RONIC and growth (Week 3 & 4)
- Accounting treatment can distort RONIC in TV formula
- Conceptually, you expect a higher RONIC without capitalization of intangible investments (see previous slide)
- Recall pre-recording: Accounting treatment creates incomparability depending on firms' growth strategies

# Terminal value for economic profit model

- What is a reasonable prediction for the terminal value in economic profit model?
- Think about the numerator of the TV equation
- By their very definition, economic profits (EP) are hard to sustain:
- Positive EP  $\Rightarrow$  Competitors enter
- Negative EP  $\Rightarrow$  Takeover, management fired, restructuring, etc.
- Thus, small or zero terminal value after several years is not unreasonable
- We should see decay in economic profits

But recall from Week 1:

# Why might Econ profits persist (even with competition)?

- Economic profit is based on accounting numbers
- We measure true economic profits only if invested capital is valued properly
- But consider how operating assets (or book value of equity) are valued:
- What happens if IC is incorrectly measured?
- Why might IC be typically too low?
- Self-generated intangibles: Our topic of the week  $\odot$
- If book value does not capture intangible assets:
- Accounting-based EP is too high (as cost of capital charge given IC is too low)
- Thus, there are two sources of accounting-based economic profits
- True economic profits & accounting measurement
- As noted earlier, this insight also has implications for the terminal value:
- Accounting-based EP (based on understated IC) may persist beyond the point where true economic profits are zero

# Terminal value for economic profit model (cont.)

- Does EP model still work for valuation?
- Equality with DCF holds for any (clean-surplus) accounting system
- EV(DCF) = EV(EP)
See pre-recording

- Thus, it does not matter for value whether or not a firm capitalizes R&D
- Bias in accounting does not invalidate accounting-based valuation
- But: Accounting measurement matters for the magnitude of TV

# Illustrating R&D capitalization in EP model

- Assume two companies that are identical except,
- Firm A expenses R&D;
- Firm B capitalizes R&D, and amortizes it over two years
- Firm A's accounting is said to be more conservative, but does it matter for valuation?
- Core idea: Accounting just allocates cash flows through time; it does not change them
- Over the life of an asset or a firm: Sum CFs = Sum Profits
- Follows from "clean surplus"
- To illustrate make following assumptions:
- Assume cost of capital = 10%
- Beginning book value = $200 (i.e., end of prior year)
- Useful life of R&D is 2 years

# Benefits of EP approach in practice

- EP and DCF should give the same answer!
- So what does EP add beyond DCF?
- EP helps us better understand value creation and economic performance
- It can improve our forecasting (i.e., understanding of the firm)
- It makes you think more critically about TV and long-term value creation
- EP model provides a link to market-to-book ratio
- Difference between book value and market value: PV of future EPs
- EP model lends itself to reverse engineering
- Analysts provide earnings forecasts that you can use directly as inputs
- Using both DCF and ABV should help the internal consistency of your model and the plausibility of your assumptions

# Adjusting for Intangibles in Intrinsic Value Models (DCF & EP)

# Adjusting for intangibles in DCF (or EP) models

- Irrespective of the accounting standards, you could capitalize R&D expenses

– Could do the same with other operating expenses that are really investments

- FCF does not change, but adjusting for intangibles likely provides more meaningful profitability and reinvestment rates
- Again: It is about the insights you gain into the economics of the firm and how that affects your forecasts!
- Assumption needed: How long does it take for R&D to be converted, on average, into commercial product?
- Useful life of research asset = amortization period
- R&D expenses (or research assets) at a pharmaceutical company should have fairly long lives
- R&D expenses (or research assets) at software firms should have shorter lives

# OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED) – Cont.

- Adjusting earnings, reinvestment rates, and book value:
- Let's assume that R&D is amortized over a life of 10 years
- Research stage lasts between 5-15 years
- Post-approval protection period often not much longer than 10 years
- Koller recommends 8-12 years
- From OMED's 424(b)4 filing (form filed prior to IPO on NASDAQ) and later SEC filings, we collect R&D expenses from 2007-2017
- OMED went public in July 2013, but was incorporated in 2004

- Perhaps easier to understand if you read backwards from 2017: - R&D from 2007 is now fully amortized (fraction = 0; last A = 2.8; no value left)

# OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED) – EBIT

- EBIT is adjusted by treating R&D as capital expenditures (like for PP&E)
This implies:

- 1) adding back all R&D expenditures
- 2) subtracting the periodic amortization of the research asset(s)
- Companies with growing R&D expenditures will have a higher EBIT after the adjustment
- In this case, the difference in EBIT is not huge:

# OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED) – NOA

- NOA is also adjusted adding the estimated value of the research asset(s) – In this case = $373.5m
- NOA is now positive, and profitability numbers make (much) more sense
- Pre-tax ROIC remains negative as OMED is quite early in the life-cycle of the research process/drug development

# Adjusting for Intangibles in Relative Valuation

# Intangibles and relative valuation

- Treating R&D investments as operating expenses affects EPS, EBIT or EBITDA
- Systematically affects multiples
- Stock price reflects the value of R&D
- PE ratios or EV/EBITDA ratios are likely upwardly biased
- But exact effect is hard to predict
- If all the companies in the sector operate under the same accounting rules (expensing R&D), why should we adjust for intangibles?
- Life-cycle: Effects of capitalization are generally much greater at young companies vs. mature companies
- Different companies pursue different strategies (e.g., in-house R&D vs. acquiring patents or small companies)
- Different intangible investments have different useful lives (or amortization periods)
- Bottom-line: Systematic effects in multiples that do not wash out

# Medfield Case

# Purpose of case

- Useful intro to the pharmaceutical industry
- Discusses trends (e.g., to biologics)
- Increasing costs to bring drugs to market
- Consolidation of the industry

Key issues for drug companies

- Patent expiration
- Competition from generics
- Valuation exercise
- Valuing existing pipeline (forecasting by product line; components)
- Valuing a new strategy
- Assessing the acquisition offer
- There is also an ethical or CSR dimension (important too)
- "Tricks" to extend patents

# Forecasting future M&A

- Should you forecast (potential) future M&A activity?
- M&A gives rise to goodwill and intangibles on the balance sheet
- Key question: Are we trying to forecast a "realistic/accurate" future balance sheet? Is this necessary in order to get the valuation (roughly) right?
- Forecasted BS is a means to an end
- We need to capture investment (but it doesn't matter if via acquisitions)
- Ultimately, we need to forecast the value created by future M&A

What is the value of future acquisitions?

Days around acquisition announcement (20 days before to 20 days after announcement)

# Putting it all together

- If future M&A is close to zero NPV, then you can ignore it in DCF or EP model – Hold existing goodwill constant in forecasted BS
- But what if the firm likely creates value through its acquisitions?
- Your forecasted growth in sales and assets can be organic or through M&A
- You can be agnostic about the way in which the firm creates value
- The key is to get the value creation roughly right (in DCF or EP)
- But: Past acquisitions and resulting goodwill can affect your ratios (e.g., ROIC and turnover) and hence your forecasts
- Take out amortization due to past M&A (if not replaced)? (see pre-recording)
- Note: You cannot take the same "comfort" in relative valuation/multiples:
- Relative valuation or multiples are affected for sure
- Organic growth vs. growth via acquisitions distorts multiples
- Illustrates again that multiples are very sensitive to accounting effects

# Setting and key case facts

- As of 2011, Medfield Pharmaceuticals sold three primary drugs with a fourth recently approved
- Fleximat: leading seller (64% of revenues), 2 years left on patent, treats autoimmune diseases
- Lodamadal:  $12 \%$ of revenues, 5 years left on patent, pain medicine
- Orsamorph:  $24 \%$ of revenues, 14 years left on patent, pain medicine
- Reximet:  $0 \%$ of revenues, 20 years left on patent, treats migraines
- Susan Johnson, Medfield's CEO, was considering 4 strategies for Fleximat:
- 1) Launch a renewed marketing effort
- 2) Evergreening (take out separate patents on components of a product)
- 3) Manufacture the Fleximat generic in-house
- 4) Reformulation (reconfigure the medication slightly in order to apply for a new patent) + required marketing campaign
- Medfield Pharmaceuticals then received a $750MM acquisition offer, requiring Susan Johnson to value Medfield's drug offerings and pipeline

# Questions

1. What is the value of Medfield's existing drugs and drug pipeline, ignoring the reformulation option?
2. What incremental financial value could Medfield create if Susan Johnson chose to reformulate Fleximat?
3. What is the value of a typical new drug? What is the value of Medfield's relative "research advantage" in perpetuity?
4. Does the acquisition offer price seem reasonable?

# Option to reformulate Fleximat

- Corporate social responsibility considerations:
- AstraZeneca's prior reformulation of Prilosec was very controversial. The reformulation was very similar to the original drug, and Walgreen sued AstraZeneca for antitrust violations
- Though the suits were dismissed, the public began to associate reformulations as purely profit-protecting strategies that contributed to rising drug prices:

"… the hundred and twenty dollars a month that AstraZeneca charges isn't to recoup the costs of risky research and development; the costs were for a series of clinical trials that told us nothing we needed to know, and a half-billion-dollar marketing campaign selling the solution to a problem we'd already solved" – Malcolm Gladwell

- Reformulating Fleximat would benefit Medfield's future sales but would increase patients' drug costs while offering little to no benefit to patients
- Could result in a reputational backlash if the reformulation attracted media attention

# Valuing Fleximat reformulation

- To value the Fleximat reformulation, incorporate Johnson's estimates for the additional research and marketing expenses that will be required
- Key point: Use incremental cash flows only!
- We also considered a potential negative shock to future sales growth to capture public backlash to the reformulation (sensitivity analysis)

# Should Susan Johnson recommend accepting offer?

- \(750MM acquisition offer price
- What is a reasonable value for the company?
- $\$ 713$ MM value of existing drugs and pipeline
- Fleximat reformulation worth around $50MM (assuming no backlash)
- Research advantage worth around $214MM
- Aside: Financial debt and cash roughly cancel each other (so not relevant)

In sum, acquisition offer seems too low

- Other considerations
- Other reformulations? But could lead to even more backlash
- New drugs (due to know-how of research team)? Already captured
- Sales force and existing physician relationships
- Note that all these considerations are closely related to why there is a difference between valuing a firm vs. its components
- And the question of whether there is a TV

# Why should acquirer pay for the research advantage?

What is the "research advantage"?

- It is human capital, know how in the particular space that Medfield operates
- It allows them to generate a new drug at a lower cost
- Imagine the current R&D team has no "research advantage"
- In this case, the acquirer should not (or would not) pay anything for the team
- Acquirer could buy the company, replace the R&D team and still generate new drugs on its own

– So the value comes from the ability to generate new drugs at a lower cost

- This is why we proceeded in two steps:
- Does a new drug have positive NPV?
- If yes, what is the value of the research advantage? This value is the relevant piece for Medfield's valuation as a firm
- You could argue that not all R&D will be successful and hence lower this value
- Case was suggesting, Medfield was pretty sure that it could generate new drugs

# Business Model

# Banks: Main activities and functions

- Deposit taking
Lending
- Underwriting and placement of securities
- Brokerage and asset management
- Payment services
- Money transmission
- Checks and credit cards
- Monitoring and information-related services: e.g.,
- Syndicated loans
- Risk-sharing services
- Liquidity insurance (e.g., demand deposits)
- Risk management
- Proprietary trading (restricted under Dodd Frank)
- Obviously, not all banks offer all functions or services

# Economics of banking: Lending

- Banks are financial intermediaries
- Receive funds from customers (deposits) or investors (e.g., short-term debt)
- Lend funds to customers (e.g., mortgages, consumer and corporate loans, credit cards)
- Earn interest rate spread
- Given their business model, banks are highly leveraged
- Banks normally have a duration mismatch:
- Duration of assets is longer than the duration of liabilities
-E.g., mortgages vs. checking or savings accounts

- Given the duration mismatch, banks hold positions in fixed-income securities
- Bank lending involves basically three risks
- Credit, liquidity and interest rate
- Banks also provide other services and earn fee or non-interest income

# Banks are very different

- Equivalent to a top line in banking is interest income (or combined interest and non-interest income)
- Equivalent to COGS is interest expense
- Think of deposits as raw material
- If they were debt, then operating income should before interest expense
- Banks largely have financial assets
- Loans are not at fair value
- Fixed (or tangible) assets are not important
- Depreciation tends to be minor
- Bank invest heavily in intangible assets
- At the core, banks are a mix of brand & reputation, human capital, and technology (or IT)

# Primer on Bank Regulation

# Banking regulation 101

- Providing a detailed exploration of banking regulation goes beyond the scope of this lecture, but I will introduce some important concepts
- Due to the duration mismatch between banks' assets and liabilities, banks are prone to runs (e.g., demand deposits)
- Banks also have a central role for credit and payments in the economy
- This "vulnerability" together with their central role in the economy are the primary reasons for bank regulation & deposit insurance

– Explicit & implicit government guarantees provide a subsidy to banks

Lower cost of capital as otherwise

- Regulation as the quid-pro-quo for guarantees
- Bank regulation broadly consists of:
- Capital requirements & leverage restrictions
- Supervision & reporting requirements
- New: Liquidity requirements

# Regulatory capital

- Banks are required to hold minimum amounts of (equity) capital
- As shown on earlier slide, the ratio of equity to total assets for U.S. banks is about  $11\%$
- What is the idea of a regulatory capital requirement?
- Regulators think of it as a 'buffer' to absorb losses

– Imagine a bank with $5 in equity capital and $100 in assets

- An  $10 \%$ impairment on the value of the assets wipes out shareholders' equity
- Rules create "buckets" for regulatory capital:
- Core Tier 1 capital: Common stocks and retained earnings
- Additional Tier 1 capital: Non-redeemable, non-cumulative preferred stock
- Tier 2 capital: Certain reserves, general provisions, hybrid instruments, and long-term subordinated debt
- Main criteria to qualify as "high-quality" capital are:

NaN. loss-absorption; 2) perpetuity; 3) residual nature of claim

# Risk-weighted assets (RWA)

- Not all assets are equally risky
- Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has issued rules on how to calculated risk-weighted assets
- Assets are weighted according to their credit/counter-party risk
- Depending on the bank, RWA are determined based on standard model or develop their own internal models, which require approval
- For example, investments in U.S. treasuries have a weight of  $0\%$ , but consumer mortgage loans have positive and much higher weights
- Aside: Lack of risk weights for sovereign debt is a major flaw of bank regulation
- In addition to credit/counter-party risk, banks consider the value-at-risk (VaR) for market risk in their securities portfolio when computing RWA
- $p \text{ VaR is defined as the probability of a loss greater than VaR is (at most)} p$
- Capital ratios are expressed in terms of RWA

-E.g., Tier 1 capital ratio = Tier 1 capital over total RWA

EXHIBIT 34.13 Estimating Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) for a Large European Bank

# Key Basel III ratios

- Common Tier 1 ratio: CT1 / RWA > 4.5%
- In addition, banks are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer: - CT1/RWA >= 2.5%
- Countercyclical buffer of  $0 - 2.5\%$  of common equity can be applied when credit growth is judged to result in an unacceptable build-up of systemic risk
- If the regulator identifies the bank to be systemically important, the capital requirements are even more stringent
- Basel III also includes a (simple) leverage ratio of equity to assets (including off-balance sheet exposures): Equity/Total assets > 3%
- Not based on risk models
- Liquidity ratios
- LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio)
- NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio)

"Stable funding" excludes short-term wholesale funding (also from interbank lending)

# Liquidity

# Global liquidity standards and supervisory monitoring

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requires banks to have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to withstand a 30-day stressed funding scenario that is specified by supervisors.

The longer-term, structural Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is designed to address liquidity mismatches. It covers the entire balance sheet and provides incentives for banks to use stable sources of funding.

The Committee's 2008 guidance Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision takes account of lessons learned during the crisis. It is based on a fundamental review of sound practices for managing liquidity risk in banking organisations.

# Supervisory monitoring

The liquidity framework includes a common set of intraday and longer-term monitoring metrics to assist supervisors in identifying and analysing liquidity risk trends at both the bank and system-wide level.

# Large exposures

Large exposures regime established to mitigate systemic risks arising from interlinkages across financial institutions and concentrated exposures.

# Empirical patterns in loan losses

- Loan losses are cyclical
- Cyclicality can pose systemic risk
- Recognition of loan losses is often delayed
- Incurred loss model
- Reluctance of banks to recognize losses
- Managing the loan losses
- Delay in loss recognition is also a function of loan types
- Homogeneous loans showed less delay

Based on statistical assessments

- For heterogeneous loans, the provision and impairment are determined on a case-by-case basis

# The Incurred Loss Model in the Financial Crisis

In the U.S.:

- "The financial crisis revealed a distinct flaw in the incurred loss model. By requiring banks to wait for an "incurred" loss event to recognize the resulting impairment, the model precludes banks from taking appropriate provisions for emerging risks that the bank can reasonably anticipate to occur. The result too often has been the need for banks to make large loan loss provisions in the midst of a credit downturn, often when earnings and lending capacity are already stressed. This leads to pro-cyclicality and results in delayed loss recognition."

Comptroller of the Currency : Remarks by Thomas J. Curry, before the AICPA Banking Conference (September 16, 2013)

IFRS:

- "By now it seems clear that the overall value of these assets has not been understated – but overstated. The incurred loss model for loan loss provisioning and difficulties in applying the model – in particular, identifying appropriate trigger points for loss recognition – in many instances has delayed the recognition of losses on loan portfolios."

IFRS Foundation: Report of the Financial Crisis Advisory Group (2009)

# Forward-looking approach: the Expected Loss Model

- Reform of the accounting standards are the crisis:
- "The accounting standard setters – the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and the SEC – should review accounting standards to determine how financial firms should be required to employ more forward-looking loan loss provisioning practices that incorporate a broader range of available credit information." (Department of Treasury, 2009)

GAAP: Current Expected Credit Loss(CECL) Estimation

- To estimate expected credit losses, information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts relevant to assessing the collectability of the cash flows of financial assets will be used. (Joint Statement by FRB, FDIC, NCUA, and OCC, 2016)

IFRS: Expected Credit Loss(ECL) Calculation

- Expected Credit Losses are calculated based on the following components: Exposure at Default, Loss Given Default, Marginal Probability of Default, and Discount Factor (KPMG, 2017)

# Recent changes: COVID delay in implementation

- Original CECL implementation schedule (October 2019):
- Effective for most public banks starting in January 2020 (smaller public banks and private banks starting in January 2023)
- Banks adopting CECL have three-year transition period, during which CECL's effect on regulatory capital is delayed.
- COVID-19 delayed the implementation of CECL (March 2020)
- CARES Act: Banks originally required to adopt CECL in 2020 have the option to delay implementing CECL until December 31, 2020, or until the end of the coronavirus national emergency, whichever comes first
- CECL interim final rule: Banks adopting CECL have the option to extend three-year transition period by another two years (i.e. can have a transition period up to five years)
- Many large banks adopted CECL in 1Q2020 anyway

# Recent jump in loan loss provisions

- Two effects: CECL adoption and COVID

Arrangements for bad debts at big US banks jump back to financial crisis levels

# Quick Summary

# Banks are very different

- Banks' financial statements are very different
- Equivalent to top line is interest income
- Interest expense are essentially COGS
- Not all assets at fair value (but closer than for non-financial firms)
- Separation of operating and financing items makes little sense
- Banks largely have financial assets
- Deposits could be viewed as raw material
- Fixed assets are not so important, except IT
- Bank invest heavily in intangible assets (e.g., human capital)
- Regulation and the role of (equity) capital

# Importance of regulatory capital

- Regulation is part of the business model

– You need to consider regulatory capital requirements in valuing the bank

- Imagine a bank pays out all its earnings as dividends
- Could it grow its loan portfolio?
- Regulatory constraints essentially impose how much equity capital a bank needs to raise or retain from its earnings to grow the business
- Bank capital rules are typically stated in terms of risk-weighted assets (RWA)
- You need to forecast RWA to know how much additional capital is required
- Clear link to reinvestment
- Pre-recording provided an overview on capital regulation
- Will illustrate link in a valuation model below

# Cyclicality in lending

- Loan demand increases with the cycle
- Deposit inflows (in good times) lead to more lending
- Remember deposits are like working capital for banks
- Banks are reluctant to let capital sit idle on their balance sheets
- Asset values rise with the cycle, which in turn raises collateral values – Makes it easier for banks and borrowers to engage
- Competition in local markets can exacerbate the cycle
- Lending standards typically decline in booms

# Going the extra mile: Cyclicality of lending distances

- Average lending distance is cyclical
- As the economy heats up, banks' lending distances expand
- In the bust, default rates on distance loans are higher
- Distance lending is partly driven by local competition & deposit inflows

# Moats and sources of competitive advantage

- Pricing power in banking is hard to obtain
- Undifferentiated products ("a loan is a loan")
- Cost of borrowing and yields are usually set by the market
- Cost advantage is an important source of moat:

Economies of scale in operating costs (including IT)

- Convenient branch networks or deep customer relationships can enhance returns through charging higher fees or offering lower rates on deposits
- Branch presence matters for collecting deposits
- Many deposits are 'sticky' (but possible tech disruption)
- Deep customer relationships spanning multiple product lines can generate switching costs

Economies of scope can be a source of a competitive advantage

- Relationship lending & soft information (e.g., in business loans)

# Economies of scale at J.P. Morgan

"Our scale creates huge cost efficiencies and enables significant resources to be brought to bear for the benefit of our company. For example, in global technology, we have nearly 30,000 programmers, application developers and information technology employees who keep our 7,200 applications, 32 data centers, 58,000 servers, 300,000 desktops and global network operating smoothly for all our clients. Resources like these allow us to constantly improve our operating efficiencies and bring enormous capability to deal with issues when we need to do so such as adjusting to all the new global rules and requirements. In total, we believe that expense synergies across the company save us approximately $3 billion a year."

Jamie Dimon letter to shareholders (JPM 2013 annual report)

"Each of our four major businesses operates at good economies of scale and gets significant additional advantages from the other businesses. We believe this is one of the key reasons we have maintained good financial performance. Below are some pretty powerful examples:

- Our North America Investment Bank generates  $29 \%$ of its investment banking revenue through Commercial Bank clients covered locally.
- Our Global Corporate Bank helped generate $1.3 billion in revenue for our fixed income sales and trading operation, increasing business to our trading desks.
- Our Private Bank gets new clients from both our Investment Bank and our Commercial Bank. And the Private Bank and Commercial Bank would have a hard time existing without our Chase retail branch network. In fact,  $55 \%$ of Commercial Bank clients and  $35 \%$ of Private Bank households visit our retail branches each quarter.
 – Of our $1.6 trillion of assets under management, approximately $300 billion comes from the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB), the Commercial Bank or the Consumer Bank.
- Fifty-five percent of retail mortgages and  $40 \%$ of Chasebranded credit cards are sold through the retail branches.

In total, we believe that the combination of our businesses accounts for \(15 billion of additional revenue, which helps drive both profits and customer satisfaction. Each of our businesses would be worse off but for the other three."

# Economic spread analysis

- NIM does not measure value creation, as it does not account for duration mismatch
- A greater mismatch increases margin due to term premium (i.e., risk)
- Value creation is better measured as the difference between the rate a bank receives on loans and the maturity-matched return on loans in financial markets – Opportunity cost (or cost of capital)
- Decomposition of NIM
- Matched capital charge is the income that would be required on assets and liabilities if there were no mismatch & no spread
- Mismatched capital charge arises from difference in duration of assets and liabilities (= compensation for risk!)
- Economic spread is obtained after adjusting for both charges
- Economic spread analysis provides insights into a bank's value creation

# Modigliani-Miller tax penalty

- Debt creates value through tax shields because interest is tax-deductible
- Banks are holding financial assets and have to pay tax on its interest income
- Creates a tax penalty
- Tax shield for debt but tax penalty for assets
- Banks are usually net holders of financial assets

This follows from the capital requirements

Thus, it is really the equity capital that determines the (net) tax penalty

- Banks incur a negative net tax effect
- This implies that equity capital is costly for banks because of the tax penalty – If you use a levered cost of equity, this penalty is included in the valuation

# Key metrics for banks: Summary

Key performance metric used for banks is ROE

- But beware of the leverage effect
- Risk shifting & under-provisioning boosts the ROE
- Key value drivers and individual metrics
- Net interest margin or economic spread
- Credit quality and loan loss provisioning
- Fee income (level and growth)
- Operating expenses (mostly for human capital) and efficiency (technology)
- Capital (and liquidity)
- Heavily regulated
- Key number in valuing banks is the forecast of ROE in the long-run

# Blackstone and Citigroup Case

- Part 1: Introduce you to Citigroup's financial statements
- Primary balance sheet and income statement line items
- Fundamentals of bank regulatory capital
- Run on bank and fair value accounting

Part 2: Valuing a loan portfolio

- Evaluating the sale of Citigroup's loan portfolio to Blackstone
- What is the value of a loan (portfolio)?

Expected cash flows, default and discount rates for debt

Computing the cost of (risky) debt

# Different Approach to Valuation

# Why do we need a different approach?

- Standard DCF or entity model (w/ FCF) does not make sense for banks
- Standard model focuses on assets and sets financing aside

Why or how does leverage enter the entity (DCF) model?

- What is asset turnover or reinvestment rate for banks?
- Could use discounted dividend model
- Used by analysts (but recall Week 1)
- Captures reinvestment through retained earnings (E - Div = Retained E)
- Could use equity models
- Capital (equity) is the key input
- Flow-to-equity model or economic profit model
- For banks, book value is a more appropriate "benchmark" to compute the cost of capital charge for economic profits
- Why?

# Cash flow-to-equity model

- Equity value equals present value of future cash flows to equity (CFE), discounted at the cost of equity,  $k_{e}$ :
- We can derive CFE as net income (NI) minus increase in book equity ( $\Delta$ E) plus (noncash) other comprehensive income (OCI)

Think about it as: CFE = NI - Reinvestment in regulatory capital

- Another way to calculate CFE is to sum all cash paid to or received from shareholders, including dividends, share repurchases, and new share issuances

<table><tr><td>CFE method</td><td>CFE calculation</td><td>Continuing value</td></tr><tr><td>Ve = ∑t=1∞ CFET/(1+ket)</td><td>CFET = NI - ΔEt + OCI</td><td>CVt = NI+1(1 - g/RONE) / (k_e - g)</td></tr></table>

- Discount with cost of equity  $(k_{e})$

# Economic profit model: Equity version

- Economic profit model can also be applied as an equity model
- Now, we use equity capital, ROE, RONE, and  $k_{\mathrm{e}}$

$$
E q u i t y V a l u e _ {0} = B o o k V a l u e _ {0} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {E c o n o m i c P r o f i t _ {t}}{(1 + k _ {e}) ^ {t}}
$$

$$
E c o n o m i c P r o f i t _ {t} = B o o k V a l u e _ {t - 1} * (R O E _ {t} - k _ {e})
$$

$$
E q u i t y V a l u e _ {0} = B o o k V a l u e _ {0} + \sum_ {t = 1} ^ {\mathrm {T}} \frac {E c o n o m i c P r o f i t _ {t}}{(1 + k _ {e}) ^ {t}} + \frac {T V _ {\mathrm {T}}}{(1 + k _ {e}) ^ {\mathrm {T}}}
$$

$$
T V _ {\mathrm {T}} (E c o n o m i c P r o f i t) = \frac {E c o n o m i c P r o f i t _ {\mathrm {T} + 1}}{k _ {e} - g}
$$

- Sometimes called "abnormal earnings" or "excess return" model

# Bank betas

- We do not use WACC for banks
- Use cost of equity
- Estimated equity beta reflects the leverage of the bank
- Can use the average levered beta for portfolio of comparable banks
- Reduces noise in beta estimation
- Unleveraging and releveraging bank betas to adjust for capital structure is less important

Regulation implies banks typically have very similar capital structures

# Flow to Equity Example:

# Deutsche Bank

# Flow to Equity Valuation: Deutsche Bank

- Deutsche Bank in October 2016
-Major losses in 2015 and "current" year (2016)
- Drop in Tier 1 regulatory capital in 2015, but still much higher than in the past
–$14 billion fine by DoJ triggered panic in markets
Rumors of possible default or state takeover
- Stock price dropped to $13.33
- Valuation challenges:
- Bank suspended paying dividends
- New equity likely to be issued due to regulatory capital shortfall
- Illustrate CF-to-equity model
- Key forecast: ROE

# Deutsche Bank: Assumptions

- ROE will return to  $5.85\%$  by year 5 (25<sup>th</sup> percentile of all banks)
- ROE will return to  $9.44\%$  in year 10

Rationale: Deutsche will earn its cost of equity in steady state

- Risk-adjusted assets (RWA) will grow by only  $1.00\%$  per year
- Tier 1 capital ratio will improve to  $15.67\%$  (set to  $75^{\text{th}}$  percentile of all banks)
- Assumption implies reinvestments (i.e., building up capital)
- Cost of equity:
- Assume  $10.20\%$  ( $75^{\text{th}}$  percentile of all banks)

Consistent with capital shortfall, they should have high CoE

- After year 5, cost of equity declines to  $9.44\%$  by year 10 (median of all banks)

Consistent with increase in (equity) capital

- Perpetual growth rate  $g = 1.00\%$

- Summing over the PV terms on previous slide implies an equity value:

<table><tr><td>Value of equity today</td><td>$31,839</td></tr><tr><td>Number of shares</td><td>1,386.0</td></tr><tr><td>DCF value per share</td><td>$22.97</td></tr><tr><td>Probability of equity wipeout</td><td>10.00%</td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted value per share</td><td>$20.67</td></tr><tr><td>Stock price on October 3, 2016</td><td>$13.33</td></tr></table>

Key points:

- Illustration of flow-to-equity model
- Valuation incorporates capital raising (and dilution): Divide by shares outstanding
- How could you incorporate a potential failure: Simple scenario

# Relative Valuation

# Market-to-book is frequently used for banks

- For banks, book value is measured closer to market value (or FV):

$$
P = \frac {D i v}{k _ {e} - g} = \frac {B V * R O E * P a y o u t R a t i o * (1 + g)}{k _ {e} - g}
$$

- Divide both sides by BV:

$$
\frac {P}{B V} = \frac {R O E * (1 - \frac {g}{R O E}) * (1 + g)}{k _ {e} - g}
$$

- MTB (=P/BV) is a linear function of ROE
- Bank with a higher expected ROE should trade at a higher MTB ratio
- Recall link between economic profits and market-to-book (or P/BV) ratio
- As always: comparability is key!
- Consider business model differences (growth and profitability)
- Banks' impairment and provisioning policies (as they determine BV)

The University of Chicago Booth School of Business

# Citigroup and Blackstone

- Part 1: Examine and understand Citigroup's financial statements
- Primary balance sheet and income statement line items
- Fundamentals of bank regulatory capital
- Run on bank and fair value accounting
- Review of the bank basics (see also pre-recording)

Part 2: Valuing a loan portfolio

- Evaluating the sale of Citigroup's loan portfolio to Blackstone
- Valuing debt

What is the value of a loan (portfolio)?

Expected cash flows, default and discount rates for debt

Computing the cost of (risky) debt

# Citigroup

# Primary line items: Balance sheet

- Assets: $2.188 trillion at the end of 2007
- Total Loans: $762 billion (35% of total assets)

Consumer and corporate loans

Typically held to maturity

- Reported at historical (or amortized) cost
- Allowance for loan losses: \(2.1\%\) (\(=\\) 16,117 / \$777,993\)

Estimate of uncollectible amounts (contra-asset)

- Trading account assets $539 billion (25% of total assets)

Investments in credit (and equity) securities that Citigroup is ready to sell

- Reported at fair value; unrealized gains and losses affect the P&L
- Liabilities

– Total deposits ($826 billion; 38% of total assets)

- Short-term borrowing and long-term debt (\(574 billion; 26%)
- Very high (simple) leverage: 18.3 (= $2,074,033/$ 113,598)

# Primary line items: Income statement

- No "classic" revenue for banks
- Net interest margin
Net interest revenue: $49.6 billion
- Why did the margin likely expand in 2007?
- Provisions for loan losses
- Compensation is a major expense for banks (50% of operating expenses)
Citi's net income declined significantly from 2006 to 2007. Primary contributors?

- "Non-interest revenue" declined by $16 billion
- Principle transactions:  $-\$ 12.1$  billion (trading losses)
- Primarily driven by subprime exposure:  $-\$ 21.8$  billion

– Provisions for loan losses increased from 6.7 billion (2006) to 17.4 billion (2007)

What happened to loan losses in 2007?

- Loan losses (\$11.7 bn) were not much higher than 2005, but used up ALLL in 2006

# Recall from Recording: Delay in LLPs and net charge-offs

- During 2007-2008, banks increased their LLPs to catch up with rising charge-offs
- LLPs should cover future loan losses (not current ones)
- LLPs increase in a middle of a crisis (procyclicality)

Net Charge-Offs (All FDIC-Insured Institutions)

# What happens during a run on the bank?

- Why are banks vulnerable to runs?
- Banks have a substantial duration mismatch on their balance sheet (short term liabilities and long term assets)
- In a run customers demand their deposits back
- They can because they are payable on demand
- But the bank only has few short-term assets
- Long-term assets cannot be liquidated (or are costly to liquidate)
- For Citigroup in 2007:

–  $38.2 billion in cash and$ 69.4 billion deposits with other banks

Citi also has securities it could sell

- $826.2 billion in deposit liabilities
- But the US has deposit insurance? Is a run still a concern?

# Regulatory capital

- Three primary ratios in 2007:

$$
\begin{array}{l} -Tier 1 Capital Ratio = \frac {Tier 1 Capital}{\text {Risk - weighted Assets}} = 4 \% \text {minimum} \\ - \text {Total Capital Ratio} = \frac {\text {Total Capital}}{\text {Risk - weighted Assets}} = 8 \% \text {minimum} \\ - \text {Leverage Ratio} = \frac {\text {Tier 1 Capital}}{\text {Average Total Assets}} = 3 \% \text {minimum} \\ \end{array}
$$

- Common stockholders' equity
- Non-cumulative perpetual preferred
- Limited amounts of other preferred securities
Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries

- Loan loss reserves (limited to  $1.25\%$  of RWA)
- Perpetual preferred (unlimited)
- Hybrid capital
- Subordinated debt (limited to  $50\%$  of Tier 1)
- Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale equity securities
- Subordinated debt (at least two-year maturity)

# Main components of Citigroup's regulatory capital?

<table><tr><td colspan="3">Components of Capital Under Regulatory GuidelinesIn millions of dollars at year end</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2007</td><td>2006</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 1 Capital</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Common stockholders&#x27; equity</td><td>113,598</td><td>118,783</td></tr><tr><td>Qualifying perpetual preferred stock</td><td></td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Qualifying mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts</td><td>23,594</td><td>9,579</td></tr><tr><td>Minority interest</td><td>4,077</td><td>1,107</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Net unrealized gains on securities available-for-sale</td><td>(471)</td><td>(943)</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Accumulated net losses on cash flow hedges, net of tax</td><td>3,163</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Pension liability adjustment, net of tax</td><td>1,057</td><td>1,647</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Cumulative effect included in fair value of financial liability attributable to credit worthiness, net of tax</td><td>(1,352)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Less: Restricted Core Capital Elements</td><td>(1,364)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Less: Intangible Assets</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Goodwill</td><td>(41,204)</td><td>(33,415)</td></tr><tr><td>Other disallowed intangible assets</td><td>(10,511)</td><td>(6,127)</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>(1,361)</td><td>(793)</td></tr><tr><td>TotalTier 1 Capital</td><td>89,226</td><td>90,899</td></tr><tr><td>Risk-Adjusted Assets</td><td>1,253,321</td><td>1,057,872</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 1 capital</td><td>7.12%</td><td>8.59%</td></tr></table>

- Risk-adjusted assets only  $57\%$  of total assets: Why lower than total assets?
- Cash and cash due from banks likely have zero weight
- Consumer loans are likely residential mortgages with only  $50\%$  weight

# Effect of $50 billion losses on Tier 1 ratio

- Approximately  $10\%$  decline in trading assets
- Journal Entry:

Dr. Principal Transactions – Unrealized Losses on Trading Assets 50,000

Cr. Trading account assets 50,000

- Losses reduce retained earnings and common shareholders' equity by $50 billion
- Effect on Tier 1 Capital Ratio:

$$
Tier 1 Capital Ratio = \frac {Tier 1 Capital}{Risk - weighted Asests} = \frac {89,226}{1,253,321} = 7.12 \%
$$

$$
Tier 1 Capital Ratio = \frac {89,226 - 50,000}{1,253,321 - 100 \% * 50,000} = 3.26 \%
$$

- Citi would be undercapitalized violating minimum Tier 1 Capital requirements – What could Citi do in response?

# Portfolio Sale to Blackstone

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/7ae4ace4-50b5-4304-b83f-eb87c360329b/a971a5785ed6a54df1ee373a596ae09b524dfa9c31e77bce2bf37c0b885274c2.jpg)

# Does this transaction make sense for Citigroup?

- Why is Citigroup seeking to sell the portfolio of leveraged loans?
- No intention to hold these loans in the first place
- Bridge loans for lucrative buyout transaction clients
- Bridge loans have escalating financing costs but they were issued at the peak of the credit cycle with loosening credit standards

Limited bank protection against downturns

- Citigroup suffered unprecedented losses
Under pressure to sell assets

- How does the deal change Citigroup's exposure to defaults in the loan portfolio? How will it affect Citi's Tier 1 capital ratio?
- Bridge loans are not intended to hold to maturity: marked-to-market
- Asset value decline directly affects income, retained earnings, Tier 1 capital
- Immediately take a hit on sale, but less exposed to future increases in default risk
- New secured loans (to PE firms) would likely have a lower risk weight

# Would selling assets improve the Tier 1 ratio?

- Start from $ 50 billion loss
- Assume for simplicity that they sell $10 billion – No gain or loss on sale (optimistic)
Starting point:

$$
Tier 1 Ratio = \frac {Tier 1 Capital}{Risk - weighted Asests} = \frac {39,226}{1,203,321} = 3.26 \%
$$

- Effect of the sale:

$$
Tier 1 Ratio = \frac{39,226}{1,203,321 + [10,000*0\%] - [10,000*100\%]} = 3.29\%
$$

# What else could Citigroup do to cover $50B loss?

- Key insight: Asset sale does not move the dial on Tier 1 Capital
- Buyers will discount the assets
- Raise Capital:

– Suppose Citi sells $10 billion of common stock to raise cash

- The new Tier 1 Capital Ratio is:

$$
Tier 1 Capital Ratio = \frac {39,226 + 10,000}{1,203,321 + 10,000 * 0 \%} = 4.1 \%
$$

- Raising capital improves Tier 1 much faster than selling assets
- Why not raise capital instead of selling assets?
- Dilution of existing shareholders due to "fire sale" of equity at depressed stock prices
- Who will buy during crisis?
- Negative signal – could set off a run
What about dividend payments?
- Citigroup paid dividends of 10.7 billion in 2007 (and still 7.5 billion in 2008!)

# Does this transaction make sense for Blackstone?

- Portfolio is a large illiquid asset
- Dislocations in the credit market

Purchase requires large amount of capital and capability to service loans

- PE firms had large amounts of contributed capital
- Freeze in credit markets and capital needs to be deployed
- Hard to implement other large buyouts
- Citigroup is a distressed motivated seller
- Needs to sell = purchase could be a bargain

Who knows more about the assets?

– Blackstone may know loan portfolio better than other potential buyers and potentially even Citigroup from past due diligence on equity investments

– Other bidders probably do not want to outbid a well-informed bidder

- Blackstone does not have control rights in the underlying portfolio firms
- Control rights would allow them to interfere with debtors

# Valuing the Deal

# Epilogue: What happened to the loan portfolio?

- Blackstone and Citi entered the deal in April 2008
- Blackstone exited completely by 2013 realizing  $2 \times$  the invested (equity) capital – Roughly  $15 \%$  p.a.
- In retrospect, the timing of the deal was probably not ideal for Blackstone
- Subsequently, CDS skyrocketed, secondary loan market prices fell and loans were marked to 70 cents on the dollar at their low point (March 2009)
- Better deals may have been available later in the crisis
- But timing the market is hard
- Blackstone did not face margin calls, but they came close

– Their equity stake was written down to close to zero and only recovered slowly

- Beta = 0.957 (Estimated using 60-month history)
- See spreadsheet on Canvas for data and estimation output

# Inputs:

- $R_{f} = 4.7\%$  (10-yr treasury yield)
- $\left(R_{m} - R_{f}\right) = 6 \%$  (based on past history – we will come back to the premium)

$\cdot \operatorname{E}(\mathsf{R}) = \mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{f}} + \beta^{*}(\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{m}} - \mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{f}})$

$$
= 4.7 \% + 0.957 ^ {*} 6 \%
$$

# Output:

- Can compute confidence interval for cost of equity

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 10.44 \% + / - 2 ^ {*} \text {Std Err} ^ {*} \left(\mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {m}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {f}}\right) \\ = 10.44 \% + / - 2 ^ {*} 0.194 ^ {*} 6 \% \\ = 10.44 \% + / - 2.33 \% \quad (95 \% confidence) \\ \end{array}
$$

See regression output for the standard error of beta estimate

# Does the CAPM work?

- CAPM is based on solid theory about the tradeoff between risk and return
- It accounts for the notion of diversification
- Realized returns are extremely noisy and so tests of the CAPM have low power
- Evidence that "conditioning" on current info is part of the issue
- Betas conditioned on current macro information or time-varying betas
- Fama and French evidence:
- Several other factors appear to explain future returns (beyond beta)
- Potential reason (among many others):
- Other sources of risk beyond single risk factor?
- Maybe small stocks have risk premium? Illiquidity premium?
- Do firms that are near financial distress have higher risk?
- But remember that the "betas" measure exposure to factors (and not the firm characteristics per se)
- Extensions of CAPM are largely empirical
- We lack a convincing and accepted new theory

# The Fama-French 3-Factor Model

Fama and French, "Common Risk Factors in the Returns on Stocks and Bonds," Journal of Financial Economics 1993

- An empirical "extension" of the CAPM:

$$
- R _ {\text {s t o c k}} = R _ {\mathrm {f}} + \beta^ {*} \left(R _ {\mathrm {m}} - R _ {\mathrm {f}}\right) + \beta_ {\text {S I Z E}} ^ {*} \left(R _ {\text {S M B}}\right) + \beta_ {\text {B M}} ^ {*} \left(R _ {\text {H M L}}\right)
$$

- Every stock has different market  $\beta, \beta_{\text {SIZE}}, \beta_{\text {BM}}$
- Where do we get  $(R_{m} - R_{f}), R_{SMB}, R_{HML}$ ?

# Example: 3-Factor Cost of Capital

- Follow same procedure as CAPM estimates, but include Size and BM in regression:

$$
\left(R _ {\text {s t o c k}} - R _ {f}\right) = \alpha + \beta^ {*} \left(R _ {m} - R _ {f}\right) + \beta_ {\text {S I Z E}} ^ {*} \left(R _ {\text {S M B}}\right) + \beta_ {\text {B M}} ^ {*} \left(R _ {\text {H M L}}\right)
$$

- Microsoft (estimated for 60 months from Dec 2002 to Dec 2006)
- Market Beta = 0.87 (notice that the beta estimate is different in 3-factor model)
- Size Beta = -0.24 (Does this make sense?)
- BM Beta = -0.95 (Does this make sense?)
- Again, see coefficients in spreadsheet on Canvas
- Calculations using arithmetic averages from previous page:

$$
\begin{array}{l} R _ {s t o c k} = R _ {f} + \beta^ {*} (R _ {m} - R _ {f}) + \beta_ {S I Z E} ^ {*} (R _ {S M B}) + \beta_ {B M} ^ {*} (R _ {H M L}) \\ = 4.7 \% + 0.87 ^ {*} 8.25 \% - 0.24 ^ {*} 3.79 \% - 0.95 ^ {*} 5.07 \% \\ = 6.15 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

- Calculations using Koller averages from previous page:

$$
\begin{array}{l} R _ {s t o c k} = R _ {f} + \beta^ {*} \left(R _ {m} - R _ {f}\right) + \beta_ {S I Z E} ^ {*} \left(R _ {S M B}\right) + \beta_ {B M} ^ {*} \left(R _ {H M L}\right) \\ = 4.7 \% + 0.87 ^ {*} 5.4 \% - 0.24 ^ {*} 2.8 \% - 0.95 ^ {*} 5.0 \% \\ = 3.98 \% \\ \end{array}
$$

# Implied Cost of Capital

# Implied Cost of Capital

- Economic (or abnormal earnings) models can be used for reverse engineering to obtain an estimate for the (implied) cost of equity capital
- Could be used for other parameters as well (e.g., implied growth rate)
- You need to assume that the market prices a firm on average correctly
- Then, we can use analysts' forecasts about future earnings and growth as a proxy for the market's expectations
- We use these as inputs and plug them into an abnormal earnings model
- Back out an estimate of cost of equity capital "implied" by the market price

$$
\mathrm {P} _ {0} = \sum_ {\mathrm {t} = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {\mathrm {D} _ {\mathrm {t}}}{\left(1 + \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {e}}\right) ^ {\mathrm {t}}} = \sum_ {\mathrm {t} = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {\mathrm {N I} _ {\mathrm {t}} + \mathrm {B V E} _ {\mathrm {t} - 1} - \mathrm {B V E} _ {\mathrm {t}}}{\left(1 + \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {e}}\right) ^ {\mathrm {t}}} = \mathrm {B V E} _ {0} + \sum_ {\mathrm {t} = 1} ^ {\infty} \frac {\mathrm {N I} _ {\mathrm {t}} - \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {e}} * \mathrm {B V E} _ {\mathrm {t} - 1}}{\left(1 + \mathrm {R} _ {\mathrm {e}}\right) ^ {\mathrm {t}}}
$$

- Hail and Leuz (2006) implement for four different models
- Could be used to infer market risk premium (see also Koller et al., Ch. 15)

# Example: Implied Cost of Capital

- Microsoft:
 – Book value per share June 2006: $3.99/share
- Earnings per share June 2007: $1.49/share
- Earnings per share June 2008: $1.71/share
- Analysts' 5-year growth estimate (LTG) =  $13.84\%$  (known to be optimistic)
- Dividend payout ratio = 28.2%
- Stock Price at \(t = 0 = \\)31.05/share\(
- Different models need different additional ingredients
- Implied cost of capital = 7.1%, 8.5%, 9.1%, 9.9%
- Hail and Leuz (2006) show that this model produces very reasonable results for 40 countries around the world
- Cost of capital is higher in countries with weaker institutions
- Effects are more pronounced in less integrated markets

Market integration makes it easier for investors to diversify institutional "defects"

# Cost of Capital for Private Firms

# Cost of equity

- No traded equity means that we cannot directly estimate beta
- Alternative approaches:

1. Industry or asset betas (basically using traded comparables)
2. Accounting and fundamental betas

# Approach 1:

- Estimate mean (median) "asset beta" (unlevered beta) for public comparables
- Then, re-lever to reflect private firm's capital structure
- Levering betas in private companies is difficult due to the lack of market prices for debt and/or equity

Use book value

- Assume private firm's future leverage ratio eventually resembles the industry average
- Use a target debt-to-equity ratio
- Approach 2: See Damodaran reading

# Unleveraging beta

Unlevered beta is weighted average of equity & debt beta

<table><tr><td>Firm</td><td>Equity Beta</td><td>E/(E+D)</td><td>Debt Beta</td><td>D/(E+D)</td><td>Unlevered Beta</td></tr><tr><td>Southwest</td><td>1.13</td><td>87%</td><td>0.00</td><td>13%</td><td>0.98</td></tr><tr><td>Alaska Air</td><td>1.80</td><td>49%</td><td>0.15</td><td>51%</td><td>0.96</td></tr><tr><td>SkyWest</td><td>1.69</td><td>49%</td><td>0.15</td><td>51%</td><td>0.90</td></tr><tr><td>Mesa</td><td>3.27</td><td>22%</td><td>0.30</td><td>78%</td><td>0.95</td></tr><tr><td>Continental</td><td>3.76</td><td>15%</td><td>0.40</td><td>85%</td><td>0.90</td></tr></table>

- Note the similarity of asset betas
- Compute median or average by industry and then re-lever for your firm's capital structure
- Ideally, try to find publicly traded "pure plays" for this exercise
- If private firm has multiple business lines, do it for each line and compute weighted average beta

# Is beta from public firm a good proxy?

Who is the marginal investor in public firm?

- Typically, a well-diversified investor
– In private company, owner has invested most of the wealth in the business
- The owner is exposed to all risk in the firm, and not just the market risk
- Use total beta for the firm: Divide market  $\beta$  by the square root of  $R^2$  (= correlation coefficient with the market):

$$
\text {T o t a l B e t a} = \text {M a r k e t b e t a /} \rho_ {\mathrm {j m}}
$$

- Ex: For a private firm  $i$  with a market  $\beta$  of 0.82 (from traded comparables) and an average R-squared of 16%:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {M a r k e t} \beta_ {\mathrm {i}} = \frac {\operatorname {c o v} \left(\mathrm {r} _ {\mathrm {i}} , \mathrm {r} _ {\mathrm {m}}\right)}{\operatorname {v a r} \left(\mathrm {r} _ {\mathrm {m}}\right)} = \frac {\sigma_ {\mathrm {i}} \times \sigma_ {\mathrm {m}} \times \rho_ {\mathrm {i m}}}{\sigma_ {\mathrm {m}} ^ {2}} = \frac {\sigma_ {\mathrm {i}} \times \rho_ {\mathrm {i m}}}{\sigma_ {\mathrm {m}}} \rightarrow \frac {\text {M a r k e t} \beta_ {\mathrm {i}}}{\rho_ {\mathrm {i m}}} = \frac {\sigma_ {\mathrm {i}}}{\sigma_ {\mathrm {m}}} \\ \mathrm {T o t a l} \beta_ {\mathrm {i}} = \frac {\text {M a r k e t} \beta_ {\mathrm {i}}}{\rho_ {\mathrm {i m}}} = \frac {\text {M a r k e t} \beta_ {\mathrm {i}}}{\sqrt {\mathrm {R - S q}}} = \frac {0 . 8 2}{\sqrt {0 . 1 6}} = 2. 0 5 \\ \end{array}
$$

# Cost of debt

- Private companies rarely have publicly traded debt
- If firm does, could use yield from its publicly traded debt or its rating
- Note that in this case firm is SEC registrant and has to file 10-Ks
- If not, try to find yields for its bank or private debt
- Directionally, one expects the cost of debt to be higher for private firms
- Reason: Access to finance is more limited
- Alternative approaches:
- Cost of debt for public comparables (plus some adjustment)
- Recent borrowing: Cost of Debt = Interest Expense/Outstanding Debt
- Synthetic rating & default spread

Estimate an appropriate synthetic rating based on financial ratios

# Synthetic ratings and cost of debt

- Steps:
- Compute the interest coverage ratio
- Infer rating based on financial ratio
- Add spread to current yield on long-term government bond
- Will share spreadsheet on Canvas
To illustrate:
- Compute interest coverage ratio
- EBIT (operating income): $132MM
- Interest expense: $39MM
- Interest coverage ratio = EBIT / interest expense = 3.38
- This CR translates to rating of Ba2/BB and spread of  $3.60\%$
- With current 10-year Treasury rate at  $0.73\%$  (May 2020), estimated cost of debt is  $0.73\% + 3.60\% = 4.33\%$
- The current year U.S. government bond interest rate is  $5.9\%$ .

# Promised yield is NOT the cost of debt

- For risky debt, cost of debt does not equal the promised yield:
- Is the cost of debt lower or higher?
- Why?
- Cost of debt is lower!
- Cost of debt is the IRR such that bond price = PV of expected future interest and principal payments
- In computing the yield, we use the promised payment in the numerator, rather than the expected payment (which is lower)
- Expected payment

= (1prob default) X promised payment + prob default X payment in default

- For this reason the current (or promised) yield overstates the cost of debt
- This effect increases as debt becomes riskier

# What are the costs of financial distress?

- Present value of expected costs resulting from risky debt financing
- Includes potential costs to firm as it approaches default and costs if it defaults
- Costs of distress are a reduction in the expected cash flows

Examples:

- Legal costs after default
- Decline in employee productivity (job hunting, low morale), turnover
- Customers' and suppliers' concerns about potential interruptions or cancellations of warranties, parts, and service
- Fire-sale of assets
- Potential underinvestment (shareholders' unwilling to fund new projects since benefits will accrue to bondholders)
- Management time spent in discussions with creditors and investment bankers about refinancing and reorganization (instead of running the business)
- Costs of financial distress likely vary across industries and over time

# How high are the costs of financial distress?

- Upper bound on expected costs of financial distress as a fraction of levered firm value for different leverage ratios  $L$
- Final column shows upper bound on costs of financial distress at actual industry leverage (1994-2004)
- Costs higher in industries with:
- Risk of asset fire-sales
- High reliance on human capital
- High importance on post-sales service, warranties, and parts

# Valuing Private Companies

# Central issue: Information

- U.S. private companies are not required to provide audited GAAP financials
- Different in many parts of the world that have statutory reporting requirements
- But even when required, information for private companies tends to be much more limited
- Owners are often secretive
- Less information production by analysts, investors, etc.
- Market prices aggregate a lot of information (including implications of macroeconomic news)

How to account for information problems?

- Adjust cash flows or cost of capital?
- We come back to this at the end and next week

# Valuation challenges for private (and closely-held) firms

What do we need to think about?

- Control (or lack thereof)
- Lack of marketability (or liquidity)
- Under-diversification of owners
- Institutional environment (as it interacts with above)
- Put differently, how should we account for?
- Value of control
- No or little liquidity
- Diversification: How should we determine beta?
- Institutional risks (e.g., poor investor protection)

# What comes with control? A few examples

- Setting company policy:
- Power to acquire and dispose of business assets
- Power to select vendors and suppliers
-M&A
- Financial policy:
- Going public (or staying private)
- Power to determine dividend policy
- Appointing management and determining compensation
- Important: With control also comes power to block any of the above (and more)
- There are also intangible benefits of control

-E.g., keeping firm in family

# Why is there a control premium?

- Control rights clearly have value (previous slide)
- But why does it matter who controls?
- There are conflicts of interest:
- Ability to make decisions that benefit insiders (private benefits)
- Link between control premium and private control benefits (show later)
- Greater information access
- Control premium can be sizeable
- On average, control premium is around  $20 - 30\%$
- Control premium is not likely to be the same across firms – Why?
- Governance & management quality
- Legal protection and institutional environment
- It matters what insiders could do with their control

# Control premium and minority discount

- Control premium and minority discount are inversely related:

$$
\text{Minority Discount}\% = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{1 + \text{Control Premium}\%}\right)
$$

$$
\mathrm {V _ {c}} = \mathrm {V _ {m}} \times (1 + \mathrm {C P}) \quad \mathrm {V _ {m}} = \mathrm {V _ {c}} \times (1 - \mathrm {M D})
$$

- E.g., CP = 25% relative to minority shares is equivalent to minority shares valued at MD = 20% relative to controlling shares
- Discount (or premium) is applied to base valuation

"Often there is more money at stake in determining what discounts or premiums are applicable to some business valuations than there is arriving at the base value." (S. Pratt, Business Valuations and Discounts, 2001)

# Marketability (or liquidity)

- Lack of marketability (discount)
- There is general agreement that the value of shares in an illiquid company should be lower – Ability to trade adds value
- Large variation in the average discount: approx.  $20 - 40\%$
- Probably much smaller today (at least in the U.S.)

Lack of marketability, more often than not, is the largest dollar discount factor in the valuation of a business interest, particularly a minority interest." (S. Pratt, Business Valuations and Discounts, 2001)

- Control premium and liquidity premium are not independent
- There are reasons why control stakes are illiquid
- Discount for lack of marketability could be different for controlling and non-controlling interest
- Why?
- Controlling insiders could change the lack of marketability (i.e., go public)

# Example

- It is common practice that minority and marketability discounts are applied in multiplicative rather than in additive fashion
- They are taken in sequence
- Here, assume a  $30 \%$ minority discount and a  $40 \%$ marketability discount
– Assume a $10 value per share for controlling owner

<table><tr><td></td><td>Example</td></tr><tr><td>$10.00</td><td>Control value</td></tr><tr><td>(3.00)</td><td>Less minority discount (30% * $10)</td></tr><tr><td>7.00</td><td>Minority value if shares were marketable</td></tr><tr><td>(2.80)</td><td>Less marketability discount (40%* $7)</td></tr><tr><td>$4.20</td><td>Value per share of non-marketable minority share</td></tr></table>

# Adjustments to valuation: Summary

- Control premium or minority discount:

$$
\text {M i n o r i t y D i s c o u n t} = 1 - \frac {1}{1 + \text {C o n t r o l P r e m i u m}}
$$

- Liquidity premium or lack of marketability discount
- Associated with limited marketability of the shares
- Is there something else?
- Wealth of Kohler family is tied to the company
- Lack of diversification

– Kohler family is exposed not only to systematic risk (measured by beta) but also to idiosyncratic risk

- Use "total beta" instead of usual market beta: Total  $\beta_{i} = \sigma_{i} / \sigma_{m}$
- Because Kohler Co is private, need to use comparable companies to estimate market or total beta

# Illiquidity vs. diversification

- What is the difference between lack of marketability discount and the total beta approach for lack of diversification?
- Beta recognizes diversification
- Total beta is lack of diversification of the owner (it is about price of risk)
- Marketability is about your ability to trade the asset (irrespective of whether or not its risks are diversifiable)
- llliquidity can increase the cost of capital even for publicly-traded firms
- Transaction costs: bid-ask spread
- Information asymmetry and adverse selection
- Asset pricing models can include illiquidity factor (e.g., Pastor & Stambaugh, 2003)
- This increase is in same spirit as lack of marketability discount
- If you discount the private firm value for illiquidity, do not also adjust cost of capital
- Be careful about double counting

# Kohler Case

# Purpose of the case

- Illustrates valuation of later-generation, large private and family-run firm
- Founding families' desire to retain control results in being less diversified
- Control benefits and family interests could be in conflict with minority shareholders
- Lack of marketability and illiquidity discount
- Great review of DCF and WACC in time for final project
- Questions:

1. Why does Herbert Kohler want the recapitalization?
2. What are the key differences to valuing public companies? (already covered)
3. Which discounts would you apply?
4. What discounts would get you to $55,400?

# Closely-held and Family Firms

# Closely-held and (publicly traded) family firms

- Both are very common around the world
- Dispersed shareholder base is the exception, rather than the norm
- Ownership is typically concentrated around the world
- As with private firms:
- Insiders have control
- Controlling blocks are illiquid

# Insider ownership and corporate governance

- With concentrated ownership, the governance (or agency) problem between managers and shareholders is less of an issue
- Why?

Instead, a different conflict of interest arises

- Conflict between controlling and minority shareholders (or insiders & outsiders)
- Controlling insiders could make decisions that are in their interest rather than all shareholders
- Private benefits consumption, keeping control in the family
- Incentives for wealth transfers, tunneling and related-party transactions
- Outside investors are much less informed
- Incentives to consume private benefits depend on investment opportunities
- Need to raise outside finance disciplines insiders

# Control premium and private control benefits

- Issue: Controlling insiders can consume cash flows that are no longer available to minority owners

– Company is not run to maximize value but to benefit controlling insiders

What would you bid as an outsider for  $51 \%$ vs.  $49 \%$ ?

– Value of the firm run optimally, say $150M

- Value of the firm with incumbent management, say $100M
- Consume $50M as private control benefits
- The difference in values between the  $51\%$  and  $49\%$  shares is:

$$
- \text {Value (Control)} = 51 \% \times \text {Value} _ {\text {Max}} = 51 \% \times \$ 150 \mathrm {M} = \$ 76.5 \mathrm {M}
$$

$$
- \text {Value (No - Control)} = 49 \% \times \text {Value} _ {\text {Status - Quo}} = 49 \% \times \$ 100 M = \$ 49 M
$$

- Majority ownership is not necessary for control:

– Shareholder can control a company with  $20 \%$ stake, if base is sufficiently dispersed

- Separation of control & cash flow rights: Pyramids, superior voting rights

# Control enhancing mechanisms

- How to exercise control
- Ownership
- Voting rights
- Board positions
- Management
- Commonly used structures to enhance control
- Dual share classes
- Enhanced (or super) voting rights
- Pyramids

# Example: Renong Berhad

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/7ae4ace4-50b5-4304-b83f-eb87c360329b/b85f82c979fb1a6d1a849749beffe3fd0f4c3183f9fb3c2c2e28351f01ef9817.jpg)

Ownership Structure of Firms Controlled by Renong Berhad

- UEM bought shares in parent, Renong Berhad, for an artificially high price
- Renong shares purchased were held by family members in UEM's and Renong's management who wanted to 'get out'
- Prosecutors and courts initially said they would intervene, but ended up doing nothing

# Example: Caterpillar buys ERA Mining Machinery Ltd.

- Caterpillar announced tender offer for Hong Kong-listed ERA Mining Machinery in late 2011
- ERA was the holding company of Siwei, one of China's biggest makers of hydraulic coal-mine roof supports
- Idea was to gain traction in China's heavy machinery market and the world's largest coal industry

– Deal closed for $677 million in June 2012

- Outcome:
- Nov 2012, during the integration process, Caterpillar uncovered discrepancy between the inventory on the books of Siwei and its actual physical inventory
- Prompted further investigations uncovered "deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct" by the Siwei management

– Jan 2013, Caterpillar took impairment charge of US$580m (86% purchase price)

- Red flags (e.g., Hong Kong listing via reverse takeover, unusual transactions between directors and Siwei) were overlooked during the due diligence process

# Investor protection

- Countries differ a lot in how they protect outside investors
- When legal protection of outside investors is weak, investors fear governance problems and expropriation  $\rightarrow$  price protect

– Evidence that family-controlled firms perform worse than widely-held firms or firms with (non-family) blockholders (in countries with weak protection)

- Differences in investor protection and disclosure regulation are associated with firms' cost of capital (and valuations)

What does this imply?

- Make sure to understand the ownership structure of a target firm
- Adjust the valuation for the effects of insider control:
- Subtract cash flows consumed by insiders for private benefits
- Consider cost of capital adjustments (see Week 8 for adjustments)
- Pay attention to related-party transactions

# Evidence on price protection by outsiders

- Outside investors recognize their 'disadvantage'
- Protect by paying less (or more if governance is good)

McKinsey 2002 survey of  $>200$ institutional investors managing $2 trillion

Large premia for strong governance:

12-14% in North America & Western Europe

20-25% in Asia & Latin America

- > 30% in Eastern Europe
- Governance "as important as financial performance" in investment decisions
- Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) survey in 2006:  $70\%$  of respondents think a firm's corporate governance is either extremely or very important
- Survey results are consistent with holding patterns of U.S. investors
- Leuz, Lins and Warnock (RFS 2008):

U.S. investors stay away from stocks with "problematic ownership structures", particularly in countries with weak legal systems and when information flows are poor

- Evidence that governance is priced by markets (in valuations & even returns)

- "Exponential growth bias"
- Underestimate the implications of compounding

# How could you incorporate corporate governance?

- Apply valuation adjustment at the end?
- Like a minority discount
- Adjust components of valuation model
- Increase cost of capital
- Adjust cash flows
- Adjusting cash flows:
- Would it make sense to use better governed firms as a benchmark

How?

- Use value drivers: They often already reflect the governance structure

Low margins due to inefficient management

Higher reinvestment rates due to value-destroying investments or private benefits

- Same applies for multiples
- Be careful about double-counting

# Related-party transactions: Rules

- In the US (ASC 850): Firms are required to disclose material related-party transactions
- PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 2410 requires auditors of public companies to review related-party transactions and communicate them to the audit committee
- In the EU, the Shareholder Rights Directive rules require companies to publicly announce "material" related-party transactions in advance and to provide information about their fairness
- Member states had to adopt their versions of these rules by June 2019
- Related-party transactions are particularly relevant in family firms, as such transactions often have the potential to negatively affect minority investors
- "In Hong Kong, most companies are family-owned, so we have to put our corporate governance emphasis on connected transactions between the major shareholders and the companies. This is different from the Western world where they have a more diversified shareholding structure, so their corporate governance measures focus on management behavior." – Paul Chow, CEO of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEx), 2004
- Cheung et al. (2006 JFE) and the HK Institute for Monetary Research found that about  $66\%$  of 328 related-party disclosures involved transactions that were likely to result in the expropriation of minority shareholders

Kohler Case: Assignment Review

# Key case facts

Kohler Co.:

- $3^{rd}$  generation family-owned plumbing fixture business

– One of the oldest and largest privately held firms in the US with 17,500 employees and $2bn+ in sales at the time of the case

- Recapitalization event
- Herbert Kohler recapitalized Kohler Co. in May 1998 to buy out all outside shareholders at $55,400

– Over 100 owners of 811 shares sued, arguing their shares were worth $273,000, almost 5 times the price offered by the company

- As the trial is about to be begin in 2000, Herbert Kohler must decide whether to settle and at what price
- Statutory valuation has to follow certain standards
- Valuation in legal settings is not necessarily the same as for financial decisions

# Herbert Kohler vs. minority shareholders

- Herbert Kohler's motivations for pursuing the recapitalization:
- Preserve family control (but he already controls  $90\%$ )
- Aversion to publicity and public disclosure (as revealed by past actions)

Are these good reasons? Tradeoffs?

– Attempt to put an end to speculation that the company may go public

- Kohler fears that continued speculation and high share prices might prompt family members to sell shares to outsiders
- Outside shareholders are a nuisance to Kohler

Minority shareholders:

– Consider proposed price of $55,400 per share too low

- Concerns about private benefits and being squeezed out unfairly
 – Book value per share above $100K and OTC prices above $100K
- Hold-up to increase proposed price?
- Dividends are only  $10 \%$ of retained earnings (DDM about $10K per share)
Why is Kohler paying such low dividends?

# Pros and cons of being private

# Pros

- Avoid having to make required public company disclosures:
- Would expose proprietary information to competitors, customers, suppliers
- Could subject management to short-termism and distract management focus
- But public markets also provide monitoring of management
- For Herbert Kohler: He gets private benefits by making company decisions that are more beneficial to him and his family rather than minority shareholders

# - Cons

- Restricts access to financing, forcing the company to rely on retained earnings and bank debt (or private equity)
- Reduced access to financing may cause the company to forgo valuable investment opportunities
- Not having a public stock lowers liquidity for shareholders, leading to a discount
- Having a price also allows to create more powerful incentives (stock-based comp)

# Risk of debt tax shields

- Two different assumptions: Affects how you unlever and relever equity betas

Alternative 1:

$$
\beta_ {A} = \beta_ {E} \times \left[ \frac {1}{1 + ^ {D} / _ {E}} \right] = \beta_ {E} \times {} ^ {E} / _ {V}
$$

- This formula assumes that the risk of the debt tax shields is equal to the risk of the assets
- WACC is used to discount the tax shields

Alternative 2:

$$
\beta_ {A} = \beta_ {E} \times \left[ \frac {1}{1 + (1 - T _ {c}) ^ {D} / _ {E}} \right]
$$

- This formula assumes that the risk of the debt tax shields is equal to the risk of the debt (interest payments)
- The cost of debt is used to discount the tax shields

- With total beta approach, a lack of marketability discount of  $20 \%$  (less than on previous slide) brings value already below $55,400
- This calculation could be viewed as the "value to Kohler"
- He would argue that he is not diversified

# Multiples analysis

- Based on financials of comparable companies (Exhibit 7b), calculate:
- EV / Sales, EV / EBITDA, EV / CF, EV / EBIAT
- Given Kohler Co.'s distribution of business across Kitchen & Bath and Power Systems, one option is to take the average and/or median multiples of the Kitchen & Bath and Power Systems comparables separately
- Apply multiples to Kohler LTM financials (most current numbers)
- We use the weighted  $80 \%$ Kitchen & Bath and  $20 \%$ Power Systems multiples for the equity value calculation
- Then use the median of the enterprise values implied by the 4 multiples (EV to Sales, EBITDA, CF, and EBIAT)
- This gives us the value per share on a marketable minority basis

Why is this the basis?

- Apply appropriate premiums or discounts

Perspective matters

- There are "consistent" combinations depending on the perspective
- Legal doctrine of fair value essentially takes the "value to Kohler" perspective

# Standards of value

- Fair market value = "The net amount that a willing purchaser would pay for the interest to a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell."
- Standard for statutory valuation, taxation, and bankruptcy
- But different standard for dissenting shareholders according to corporate law – Model Business Corporation Act prescribes "fair value"
- Fair value = "The value of the shares immediately before effectuation of the corporate action to which dissenter objects, excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the corporate action."
- MBCA was revised in 1999 to clarify that it does not incorporate discounts for lack of marketability or lack of control (i.e., essentially the "value to Kohler")
- Trial was scheduled for April 2000 (but Wisconsin had not yet ratified the amendment)
- There was ambiguity as to how the courts would decide

# Epilogue

- On April 11, 2000, one day after the hearing started, Kohler Co. settled at a price of $135,000/share plus $5,000 to cover legal fees and $8,000 in interest expenses
- A separate lawsuit alleging Kohler Co. breached its fiduciary duties owed to shareholders was dismissed as part of the settlement
- In 2005, the IRS sued the estate of Frederic Kohler over estate taxes – In this case, the relevant standard is FMV, so all discounts apply – In 2006, a court ruled that the FMV of the shares was 48K per share
- Kohler Co. has remained privately held by the Kohler family
  - Its Executive Chairman is Herbert V. Kohler, Jr. and its President and CEO is now David Kohler (son of Herbert)

# A few technical notes re discounting

- Issue 1:
- The valuation date is not the first day of the first year of the forecast horizon
- Example: Fiscal year is the calendar year (FYE 12/31) but valuation date is Feb 28 (59 days into year +1)
- Solution:
- Value is first estimated as of FYE and then adjusted (i.e., shifted) to estimated value on Feb 28
- Estimated Equity Value $_{\text{Feb 28}} =$  Estimated Equity Value $_{\text{FYE}} \times (1 + R_{\text{e}})^{59/365}$
- Important: Use the cost of equity as you are shifting equity value
- Issue 2:
- Cash flows do not "arrive" on the last day of the fiscal year – they usually accumulate over the entire year
- Solution: Mid-year adjustment
- Discount cash flows by half a year only (for example)

# Opportunities of Investing Abroad: FDI and M&A

# Importance of international investments

- Globalization of markets
- Financial integration through liberalization of capital markets
- Economic integration through increased trade
- Increased integration has led to a dramatic increase in cross-border M&A, particularly with emerging markets
- Firms become more international in their operations
- Best opportunities have often been abroad
- Increasingly, emerging market companies are engaging in cross-border M&A too

1,095 cross-border acquisitions by emerging-market companies, 2000-13, average deal volume per year,  $\%$

# Emerging market companies

- At the start of the 90s, companies from U.S., Western Europe and Japan represented the bulk of the global economy
- This has fundamentally changed over the past 25 years

Emerging market companies are among the largest globally

- Weight of EMs in MSCI All Country index has increased

From 2% in 1988 to 22% in 2016 (from 24 countries)

- Increasing investor demand for these companies
- Key issues when analyzing emerging market firms:
- Currency risks and exchange rate volatility
- Country and institutional risks
- Information quality, corporate governance, ownership concentration
- Basic ingredients for valuing emerging market companies are the same
- But many practical issues

# Opportunities of Investing Abroad

# Why invest abroad?

Commonly cited benefits from investing abroad (as a portfolio investor)

- Higher returns than in the U.S.
- Diversification benefits
- Domestic multinationals have significant international exposure
- But offer inefficient diversification compared to international portfolio
- Purely domestic portfolio can be viewed as an "active" deviation from a global benchmark
- Domestic strategy can have significant asset-selection risks as well as industry and style tilts (relative to global benchmark), especially true for
- Domestic large cap strategy
In countries with small domestic equity markets

CUMULATIVE INDEX PERFORMANCE - NET RETURNS (USD) (FEB 2004-FEB 2019)

- Emerging markets have historically outperformed developed markets
- But they also are riskier – see volatility in chart above
U.S. has offered a higher return for a given level of risk and hence was more attractive standalone investment than most foreign markets
- This does not imply that foreign markets are not attractive in combination with U.S. stocks

# Diversification benefits

- Benefits from foreign equity investments are well documented
- Higher return and/or lower risk
- Originally, investors started with domestic-international allocation
- Focused on developed markets and larger cap stocks (e.g., MSCI EAFE index)

Figure 2: Going Abroad Has Provided Diversification

Even a small fraction of foreign investment in developed economies dominated a  $100 \%$ US portfolio

# Diversification benefits from emerging markets (EMs)

- EMs often viewed as appealing due to lower correlations with the U.S. as compared to other developed markets (DMs)
- Additional diversification benefits relative to DMs
- In 70s and 80s, EM correlations with U.S. were very low
- Still fairly low in 90s
- In last two decades, correlations with U.S. have increased considerably
- True for both EMs and DMs
- Effect of market liberalizations, financial integration, macroeconomic coordination, and globalization
- What does this mean for diversification benefits?

# Changes in correlations over time

Returns are gross in USD; correlation based on rolling 36 monthly returns.

# Is it still worth it (given increase in correlations)?

- Do we care about a low correlation per se?
- We would not use a lottery for diversification (even though it is uncorrelated with our portfolio return)

Diversification benefits are not just determined by the correlations

- They also depend on expected returns and volatility
- It is possible that diversification benefits and the Sharpe ratio increase, despite the fact that correlations increase
- Not only correlations, but also returns and risk in EMs have changed over time

Two time periods with different correlations:

-Black: lower correlation

# Trend towards investments in international small caps

- These investments are often motivated by lower correlations of small caps

CORRELATIONS BECAME ATTRACTIVE BY ADDING SMALL CAPS

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/7ae4ace4-50b5-4304-b83f-eb87c360329b/cc70b892ba54620e73e3c9218e5c2980eb8290f9f033b2993091b9f6a0dd86c2.jpg)

Correlations based on monthly returns from January 2001 to June 2017

# Trend towards international small caps (cont.)

- Conceptually, it makes sense that multinationals and large global players in EMs offer less diversification
- But again, we also need to consider expected returns and volatility
- While foreign small caps can be attractive from a diversification or growth perspective, they tend to have larger risks and pose challenges in terms of
- Information
- Corporate governance
- Liquidity
- These risks matter especially for M&A

# What about crises?

- Diversification benefits and optimal allocations change through time
- See earlier graphs
- During financial or corona crisis, there was no place to hide (in equities) – See next slide
- Do we really believe that we can hedge against a major financial crisis (rocking banks in developed countries) by buying shares in China (or elsewhere)?
- China is highly dependent on the U.S. consumer
- Financial markets have never been more interconnected
- This risk is better addressed with asset allocation (across classes of assets)
- So not really an argument against diversification

- Similar results could be shown for other crises
- Despite widespread negative returns, there are substantial differences in how EMs fare during crises
- Crisis performance often depends on countries' legal and political institutions

# To what extent do we invest abroad?

- In sum, case for investment in EMs as part of an equity portfolio remains strong
- EMs offer substantial diversification benefits
- EMs provide interesting investment opportunities
- Nevertheless, there is significant home bias around the world
- Traditional asset allocation: Domestic/international is still common
- Traditional explanation: Barriers to foreign investment, e.g.,
- Capital and currency controls;
- Transaction and trading costs
- Different accounting standards
- Many traditional barriers to foreign investment have decreased over time:
- Adoption of international accounting standards (IFRS)
- Financial liberalizations in many countries
- However, home bias has not declined much, given the decline in barriers

– Barriers and transaction costs alone cannot explain home bias

Home Bias has not substantially changed from 1994 to 2004

# Non-traditional reasons for home bias

- Behavioral and cultural biases (e.g., familiarity)
- Concentrated ownership around the world
- Home bias is much smaller once we adjust for availability of shares (free float)
- What countries and which foreign stocks do U.S. investors shy away from? (e.g., Leuz et al., RFS 2009)
- U.S. investors invest less in countries with poor institutions and firms where the managers and their families have high levels of control
- Result is particularly pronounced for firms with poor info flows

Information and governance problems can explain a good deal of home bias

- Information and governance explanations have different implications than behavioral or cultural biases
- There can be good reasons why investors put less money in certain foreign markets

# International Risks

# International risks

- International investments have a broad range of risks
- "Classic" international risks: Currency and macroeconomic risks
- But there are other issues to consider
- Poor outside investor and legal protection
- Corporate governance and expropriation by controlling insiders
- Transparency and information risks
- Corruption and political risk (e.g., expropriation by government)
- These factors matter particularly in financial crises
- They can explain crisis returns (e.g., Asian crisis)
- Market liquidity and ability to trade is closely linked to transparency
- Transaction costs (in particular price impact)
- Lecture will cover a number of these risks

# Measuring International Risks

# Measuring international and country risks

- There are many useful sources

-Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)
-IHS Economics and Country Risk
- Institutional Investor Country Credit Ratings (IICCR)
- International Country Risk Guide (ICRG)
- Measuring institutional quality is a major effort at the World Bank and IMF
- Worldwide Governance Indicators & Doing Business Reports
- Measuring political risks is still an art rather than a science
- Scores often map into sovereign spreads
- Priced in cost of capital
- Scores can be useful to quantify country differences as well as the components of country risk

# Sovereign risk

Rising political and policy uncertainty, following the sacking of the respected finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, as part of a controversial cabinet reshuffle on March 31st, has dampened the country's prospects and sustains the country's rating in the middle of the BB band.

# Currency risk

The reshuffle ended a period of rand strengthening, leading to a fresh fall in the local currency. Heightened political and economic risks will put the rand under pressure, although an upturn in mineral markets, alongside signs of a weaker US dollar, will be supportive.

# Banking sector risk

The policy and political uncertainty also applies to local banks, and marks a small rise in risk, but the robust and well-supervised banking system supports the rating. Capital-adequacy ratios will remain comfortably above prescribed minimums and profitability will remain healthy. High levels of household debt and rising interest rates may push the impaired loan ratio higher, but the risks are manageable.

# International Cost of Capital in Practice

# How do we capture international risks?

- Cost of capital is frequently used to account for international risks
- These factors are generally not captured in and compensated w/ beta
- Common to make adjustments to cost of capital
- How should we determine the cost of capital?
- Lecture will cover some alternatives
- What do practitioners do?
- Most practitioners start with CAPM (see Readings for Week 8)
- Make adjustments to the CAPM to account for country risks
Common to use sovereign spreads over U.S. treasury yields to capture country risks: e.g.,
- CoC = Rf^US + Beta * (U.S. Equity Premium) + SS

# What do practitioners do?

- There are many different models and proposed approaches
- Different values for Exxon Mobile investment in Argentina (in 2005):

"[U]nfortunately, the only real consensus is that there is no consensus on how to estimate the international cost of capital. Almost every academic or practitioner has a different recommendation."

# Valuing international investments

- Basic principles are the same as for domestic projects
- DCF can be used to evaluate a (foreign) business plan, capital investment, and acquisitions
- The same factors affect value around the globe:
- Future cash flows
- Timing of the cash flows (and the time value of money)
- Risk of the cash flows (systematic, non-diversifiable risks)
- But in practice valuing international investments poses many challenges
- There are additional (or different) risks
- Need to be careful about how we capture those risks

Numerous practical problems in quantifying the risks

# Importance of the cost of capital

- Cost of capital determines the hurdle rate for investments
- Not just M&A but also capital budgeting, FDI, etc.
- What happens if companies (or investors) set hurdle rate for foreign investments too high?
- Cost of capital is also relevant for other internal purposes:
- Divisional capital allocation

# International (or Institutional) Risks

# International risks

- International investments pose unique risks
- "Classic" international risks: Currency and macroeconomic shocks
- But there are other issues to consider (recall Week 7)
- Outside investor and legal protection
- Corporate governance and expropriation by controlling insiders
- Transparency and information risks
- Corruption and political risk (including expropriation by government)
- These factors are generally not captured in or compensated with beta
- Do you have them in your cash flows?

# Ownership structure and investor protection

- Concentrated ownership can create many conflicts
- Private benefits (e.g., to family)
- Related-party transactions
- Separation of control & cash flow rights: pyramids, superior voting rights
- As discussed in Week 7, countries differ in how they protect outside investors
- Clearly, important consideration in valuation
- There are differences in:
- Legal protection (e.g., against self-dealing, expropriation)
- Rules for corporate governance
- Legal enforcement (e.g., collateral enforceability)
- Efficiency of the courts
- Market discipline (e.g., analysts)

# Transparency

Information risk

- How likely is it that you, as a foreigner, have all the relevant information to assess the value of the investment?
- Recall the Caterpillar/ERA example
- Transparency and reporting quality differs substantially across countries
- Information risk is closely related to ownership structure and corporate governance (Leuz, Nanda & Wysocki, JFE 2003)

– Private benefit consumption creates incentives to withhold or hide information

- Poor investor protection, poor governance and poor transparency often go hand in hand (see Week 7 at the end)
- Governance problems are often at the heart of accounting shenanigans or, worse, at the core of accounting scandals
- Enron, Tyco, Parmalat, Satyam, Wirecard, etc.

# Political risk

- Broad concept that encompasses the potentially adverse effects of a country's political environment
- People often think of political risk in terms of direct expropriation: e.g.,
- May 1, 2007, Hugo Chavez announced that control of Venezuelan oil fields would transfer from international oil companies to PDVSA
– April 18, 2012, President Kirchner announced she was taking full control of Argentina's YPF, expropriating almost all of Repsol's majority stake

- However, direct expropriation is fairly rare
- When it happens, it is often related to natural resources
- "Creeping" expropriation is much more common: e.g., taxes are raised, regulations are changed, etc.

# Forms of political risk and investor concerns

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/7ae4ace4-50b5-4304-b83f-eb87c360329b/2440142fe969bc039b0c0bde8ac6277a313e52c447800c5fab10944731bbe5ff.jpg)

- Political risk takes many forms
- Direct expropriation
- Expropriation by (special) taxes
- Rules favoring locals
- Corruption and political connections
- Political risk is highly correlated with information & governance problems and macroeconomic issues
- Connected or corrupt firms generally have an incentive to be opaque
- Get funding from politically connected banks rather than capital markets

Karolyi: Cracking the Emerging Markets Engima

# How do institutional risks matter?

- Matter for M&A deal or investment outcomes
- Returns in EM markets are in part compensation for higher risks
- Investors' portfolio holdings reflect risk factors ("vote with their feet")
- Institutional factors and risks are "priced" in equity markets
- Market liquidity
- Valuations
- While country risk has become less important over time, it is still a large factor
- Institutional factors matter more in crises, especially for EMs
- Explain differences in crisis returns across countries (e.g., Asian crisis)

Cost of capital

Hurdle rates for international investments differ

- Bottom line: You need to consider institutional factors and risks!

# What explains these differences in cost of capital?

- Differences in business risks (e.g., industry)
- Typically captured in beta
- Differences in inflation or risk-free rate (country level)
- Differences in:
- Securities and transparency regulation
- Rule of law and legal enforcement
- Investor protection, expropriation risk & corporate governance
- The country differences are not (fully) captured in beta
- They matter when setting the hurdle rate for investments
- Important:
- International risks also manifest in cash flows

# Are institutional risks diversifiable?

- Some risks should be diversifiable
- An investor can hold a portfolio of similar companies from different countries
- Hail and Leuz (2006) show that the effects of institutional differences on the cost of capital decline as countries and markets become more integrated
- But even if some risks are diversifiable, they are not irrelevant
- Need to adjust expected cash flows for the possibility of adverse future events
- Remember that you can always translate cash flow risks into discount factor adjustment

Key point: Some discount factor adjustments are in lieu of cash flow adjustments, and not because the risk is systematic (in a beta sense)

# International Valuation Process

# Global valuation: Step 1

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/7ae4ace4-50b5-4304-b83f-eb87c360329b/e9bac2956614ab18093ebeb717336797da61d0b789be6f9748af96781f7131f1.jpg)

- Hyper-inflationary economy:
- In hyper inflation countries, nominal forecasts are dominated by inflation rate
- Forecast real cash flows (exclude or back out inflation)
- Discount cash flows with a real interest rate
- Low to moderate inflation economy:
- Forecast nominal cash flows (include inflation)
- Discount cash flows with a nominal interest rate

# Global valuation: Step 2

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/7ae4ace4-50b5-4304-b83f-eb87c360329b/812b1d2a0cfd25f184a697f4d1685cb9ad9ca7b36fe9a46a7309b93cbebe15d5.jpg)

- Financial data are typically collected in local currency
- Local currency data more relevant to local management
- Forecasts are often easier to do in local currency
- Many information sources are in local currency
- Even if you forecast and discount in local currency, you can still convert NPV into home currency at spot exchange rate (after Step 5)

# Which cash flows should you use?

- Basic principle:
- Use incremental cash flows
- Recall Medfield case (Week 5)
- Should the cash flows be estimated from the perspective of the parent or the foreign sub?
- Relevant cash flows are those to the parent
- Use only cash flows that could be repatriated (net of transfer costs)
- Follow 3-step process
- Start from perspective of the foreign project or subsidiary
- Adjust to the perspective of the parent or headquarters
- Take into account indirect costs and benefits to the group
- This last step takes into account synergies

# Global valuation: Step 3

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/7ae4ace4-50b5-4304-b83f-eb87c360329b/8f8d0aa9af2494eeebf5672317052c10786dbd484922843dc5060aeb50103bd0.jpg)

- Assess possible risks to see whether they are separately identifiable and could be captured in projected (future) cash flows
- Risks that are captured in this step should no longer be "included" in the discount rate
- Do not double count!
- This allocation of risks is probably the hardest part of global valuation process

# How capture risks in cash flows using scenarios

# Steps:

1. Identify risks and estimate their probabilities of occurrence
2. Estimate at what point in time these risks are most likely to occur
3. Identify the impact of each risk on future cash flows
4. Calculate expected value of cash flows by weighting the cash flows in each scenario by the probability of the scenario

- Simple example: Information risk
- Suppose that you are worried that you can't tell the condition of the factory you are buying
- Assign a probability (suppose  $50\%$ ) that you will have to spend much more in capex the second year of the project to replace things that seemed fine upon initial inspection
- An easy way to implement scenarios is to create separate "tabs" for each scenario – You can weight the NPVs in each scenario by the probabilities
- Alternative way to capture risks: Adjust the discount rate

# Reasons to adjust cash flows

- It often seems that many (international) risks are too hard to quantify
- But are "whole-sale" adjustments of cost of capital better?
- It is easy to overestimate risks with "simple" discount rate adjustments
- Cash flow adjustments provide more information
- Acknowledges a broader range of outcomes
- Communicate the potential risks
- Keep in mind that project proposals often need to be submitted to HQ
- Relevant information is often local (or in operations)
- Encourages risk mitigation by making certain risks apparent
- Deals are structured to mitigate risks

# Reasons to adjust cash flows (cont.)

- Typical country risks to portfolio investors (which are reflected in equity market returns or sovereign spreads) may not apply to M&A or FDI
- Proposed investment may have features that are different from typical stock market investment in the country

You have control

- Foreign multinationals are often not expropriated because they would be a "prominent victim"
In many settings (e.g., crises), foreign multinationals fare differently than local companies

- Thus, it makes sense to think specifically about "bad" outcomes rather than simple discount rate adjustments

– Cash flow adjustments allows you to capture the specifics of your investment

- Alternative: Make more tailored adjustments to the cost of capital

# Global valuation: Step 4 (Optional)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/7ae4ace4-50b5-4304-b83f-eb87c360329b/715cb8c147d3d9d826a082fbc294d54eb2a391f810d949826c2356dd084483a6.jpg)

- Future cash flows can be translated into home currency using forward rates:
- Obtain these forward rates from banks or FX traders, but they
- Contain currency risk premia (be careful about double counting)
- Are typically not available for more than 18 months or a few years into future
- Compute implied or synthetic forward rates using covered interest rate parity:

Use spot exchange rate and interest rates in two countries to convert

- Alternatively, we can discount with a local currency cost of capital in Step 5

# Global valuation: Step 5

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/7ae4ace4-50b5-4304-b83f-eb87c360329b/1e02b0de11b7e3e7617b2c028abe78772e736c5e70d0fc302148cc76b1374f4f.jpg)

- Be consistent:
- If you have converted cash flows into dollars in Step 4, then you need to use dollar discount rate (with dollar inflation expectation) in Step 5
- Avoid double counting:
- The idea is to account for systematic risks from the perspective of home-country parent shareholders
- You need to keep track of the risks you have handled in the cash flows; only the remainder should be in the discount rate

# Dow Chemical Case

# Dow's Bid for the Privatization of PBB

- In Nov 1995, Dow Chemical is considering bidding on PBB, which is being privatized by the Argentine government
- Base-case cash flows for the project that include some operational efficiency improvements have been prepared
- Case requires the valuation of an international project
Key questions:

- Think about international risks
- How to incorporate risks into the valuation model?
- What risk premium and cost of capital would you use?
- Two scenarios:
- Expropriation
- Currency crisis

# International Cost of Capital (WACC)

# Let's start with what most people do

- Recap from pre-recording:
- Only consensus is that there is no consensus
- Most practitioners nevertheless use the CAPM (Readings for Week 8)
- Start with CAPM
- Make adjustments to the CAPM to account for country risks
- CoC = Rf^US + Beta * (U.S. Equity Premium) + Sovereign Spread
- This approach uses the default risk of the sovereign as a proxy for country risks – Not all sovereign risk is relevant (or systematic)

# Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

$$
\mathrm {W A C C} = \frac {\mathrm {D}}{\mathrm {V}} \mathbf {r} _ {\mathrm {d}} (1 - \tau) + \frac {\mathrm {E}}{\mathrm {V}} \mathbf {r} _ {\mathrm {e}}
$$

- Use target capital structure (based on market values)
- Cost of debt
- If the foreign investment does not substantially change the parent's default risk and cost of debt, then simply use the cost of debt of parent company
- Otherwise, you need to adjust cost of debt to new default risk
- Be careful about the currency:
- If you have converted cash flows into home (or domestic) currency, then using parent cost of debt in home currency is fine
- Otherwise, you need to use foreign (or local) currency cost of debt to account for inflation
- Conversion with interest rate parity relation (next slide)

# Converting $ cost of capital to local cost of capital

- Assuming the "covered interest rate parity" relation holds, you can compute a foreign currency cost of capital as follows:

$$
r _ {F o r e i g n} = (1 + r _ {U S \$}) \times \frac {(1 + \mathrm {r i s k - f r e e r a t e} _ {F o r e i g n})}{(1 + \mathrm {r i s k - f r e e r a t e} _ {U S \$})} - 1
$$

- Or, alternatively:

$$
r _ {F o r e i g n} = (1 + r _ {U S \S}) \times \frac {(1 + \exp . i n f l a t i o n _ {F o r e i g n})}{(1 + \exp . i n f l a t i o n _ {U S \S})} - 1
$$

# Cost of equity capital using the CAPM:  $r_f$

$$
C o s t \quad o f \quad E q u i t y = r _ {e} = r _ {f} + \beta \left(r _ {m} - r _ {f}\right)
$$

- What do we use as the risk-free rate?
- Ideally, you would use a risk-free rate that matches the "duration" of the cash flows from the firm that you are valuing
- Common to use 10-year (or longer) U.S. treasuries as proxy
- Long-term government bonds are not risk free in all countries
- Could use U.S. treasuries, but they reflect inflation expectations for U.S.
- Need to adjust for differences in inflation rates across currencies
- Again, remember to use same currency for cash flows and cost of capital

# Cost of equity capital using the CAPM: Equity premium

$$
C o s t \text {o f} E q u i t y = r _ {e} = r _ {f} + \beta \left(r _ {m} - r _ {f}\right)
$$

- What have you used for the equity risk premium?
U.S. equity premium from 1903 to 2002:

- Arithmetic average = 6.2%
- Arithmetic average is the best estimator but it compounds measurement error when returns are serially correlated
- Adjusting for serial correlation, the arithmetic average is about  $5.5\%$
- Risk premia need to be computed over long horizons
- Distant past may not be representative of the future

Equity premium likely has decreased over time

- But risk premia can also go up in response to financial or economic crises

# Illustrating problems with historical equity premium

Historical equity premium still seems to reflect a country's development, history and also industry concentration

$$

- Notion of diversification and systematic risk applies to foreign investments
- In fact, foreign investments might offer higher diversification potential
- Thus, foreign investments could even have a lower cost of capital
- Of course, we also need to account for the additional (country) risks
- What is conceptually the "right" perspective for foreign investments?
- Parent company shareholders, parent firm, foreign shareholders?
- Basic principle:
- Contribution of foreign investment to systematic risk borne by parent company (home country) shareholders
- The principle is the same for domestic and foreign projects as well as projects in different industries

# Cost of equity capital using the CAPM: Beta

- Thus, beta of foreign investment has to be evaluated from perspective of parent company shareholders (or home country investors)
- Assume parent company shareholders are mostly from home country:
- Mexican manager who considers building a plant in the U.S. computes beta of the investment relative to the Mexican index
- U.S. manager who considers building a plant in Mexico computes the beta of the investment relative to the U.S. index
- This assumption is not unreasonable:
- Many equity markets are not fully integrated
- Shareholders exhibit significant home bias
- Supported by empirical evidence (pre-recording)
- Why not use World CAPM (e.g., MSCI ACWI)?

# Alternative Approaches

# Implied cost of capital: Firm and market Level

- Economic profit model can be used for reverse engineering to obtain an estimate for the (implied) cost of capital
- Could be used for other parameters as well (e.g., implied growth rate)
- You have to assume that the market prices a firm on average correctly
- Then, we can use analysts' (consensus) forecasts about future earnings and growth as a proxy for the market's expectations
- Back out an estimate of cost of equity capital "implied" by the market price
- Spreadsheet on Canvas implements four models used in the Hail and Leuz (2006) to estimate firm-level cost of capital

# Erb, Harvey and Viskanta (1996) approach

- Return-based approach (but no market index required)
- Basic idea is similar to practitioner models
- Political and country risks should be reflected in country (sovereign) credit risk ratings, but some may be diversifiable
- Model for Cost of Equity:  $R_{\text {country}} = \alpha + \beta^{*} \ln \left(\text {Country Credit Risk Rating}\right)$
- Ad-hoc approach but works well in practice
- Good fit with returns and sovereign bond ratings
- Implied cost of capital has solid theoretical basis
- Estimates of Hail/Leuz (2006) and EHV approach are highly correlated:  $\approx 0.64$
- Both models "agree" on relative risks
- With EHV approach, you can compute cost of equity for 136 countries

# Key input: Institutional Investor Country Credit Risk Ratings

- Euromoney publishes ratings semiannually
- Based on survey of 75-100 bankers
Ratings are on a scale of 0-100
- Higher scores are better
- highest possible is 100

# Illustration of EHV approach

- Plug rating into the model:
- Cost of equity capital = 12\*(0.051537 - 0.01036\*Ln(IICCR))
- Ln(IICCR) is natural logarithm of country credit risk rating
- Taking the log is important as the relation is likely to be nonlinear
- As credit ratings get low, expected returns may go up faster
- Model provides a dollar-denominated cost of capital estimate
- Again, this rate can be converted to local currency cost of capital

Example:

- Assume U.S. investor or multinational investing in Peru
- Peru's IICCR as of March 2019 = 59.2
- Plug into formula to compute discount rate:
- Cost of equity capital = 11.11%
– In $ from perspective of US investor

# Adjusting the risk premium: Basic idea

- Use different sources and your knowledge about the investment to assign weights for the risks that go into the average premium
- Then assess to what extent your specific project is exposed to these particular risks and adjust according to the weights
- These adjustments and approaches are "fuzzy" but as Keynes said:
- "It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong"
- For example, Karolyi radar charts:

# Key lessons: International cost of capital

- There is no generally accepted approach to computing cost of capital for global investments
- There are many approaches
- But many common practices have conceptual flaws
- Implied cost of capital is forward looking and hence often more relevant
- Consider tailoring your cost of capital and beware of double counting
- These adjustments are "fuzzy"
- Setting the cost of capital too high means that you are missing out on positive NPV opportunities
- Compute the "implied haircut" to cash flows

# Dow's Bid for the Privatization of PBB

- In Nov 1995, Dow Chemical is considering bidding on PBB, which is being privatized by the Argentine government
- Base-case cash flows for the project that include some operational efficiency improvements have been prepared
- Case requires the valuation of an international project

Key questions:

- Think about international risks
- How to incorporate risks into the valuation model?
- What risk premium and cost of capital would you use?
- Two scenarios:
- Expropriation
- Currency crisis

# Background on Dow and PBB

- Running a plant complex such as PBB is exactly what Dow does (see Table B, Exhibits 1A and 1B)
- By 1995, it had 94 plants in more than 30 countries
- Dow's first Latin American investment was in 1957
- Investments in Colombia, Chile, Brazil, and Argentina
- Largest investment is in Brazil where it has a petrochemical complex

What spurred the privatization of PBB?

- In 1995, all trade restrictions between members of Mercosur were lifted
- As a result, competition was going to increase
- Brazilian producers had a larger scale and were more efficient
PBB facilities require upgrading

- On Oct, 2 1995, Argentina announced intent to sell  $51 \%$ of PBB

# Plan for development of PE business in Argentina

- Vignart (VP business development for LatAm) believed bringing all of Bahia Blanca's PE activity under Dow's control would be consistent with Dow's business model
- There are 3 project stages:
- Stage 1: PBB acquisition (1 ethylene facility, 1 polyethylene facility) and upgrading of facilities to make them internationally competitive
- Dow would need to bid against Copesul and Perez Companc, regional players who teamed up to bid for PBB
- Stage 2: Polisur acquisition (2 polyethylene facilities)
- Dow would need to negotiate with Ipako, the private owner of Polisur
- Stage 3: Expansion of capacity (construct new ethylene facility (or cracker) and a new polyethylene plant)
- Dow would need to secure supply of additional ethane and find a reliable partner
- Question: Should you evaluate all three stages for the bid or only the first one?

# Evaluating all project stages for valuation

- Argument for considering the value of cash flows from all 3 stages:

– Think about the business rationale of the second and third stage

- Unlikely Dow would invest in any one of these stages as a standalone project
- Vignart: "If we were to get into the privatization, the project would require the modernization of existing facilities and … expansion of existing plants and the construction of new plants, in order to become internationally competitive."
- Obviously, Dow would not necessarily bid the entire NPV from all three stages
- But to decide whether bidding is worth doing, Dow has to consider all three stages
- Bid will be for  $51 \%$ stake only
- We have cash flows for entire complex (all three stages)

# Stage 1 forecasts reflect interdependencies

- Stage 1 already includes some upgrading and two separate cash flows:
- 1) Ethylene cracker
- Forecast assumes cracker's operating rate improves from  $90.2\%$  to  $100\%$
- Dow will operate cracker more efficiently due to the $72.9MM capital investment
- Ethane ratio remains constant: Plant's efficiency can't be improved, which is why Dow needs to build a more efficient cracker in Stage 3
- 2) Polyethylene plant

# What risks does Dow face? (Question 1)

- Given the cash flow estimates, the next step is to think about potential risks
- What risks does Dow face in Argentina from PBB investment?
- We need to diagnose the critical risks of this investment
- Business risks and country risks
- Thereafter: How should the risks be incorporated into the valuation analysis?
- Discuss whether these risks are captured in the cash flows or need to be added to the discount rate

# What are critical business factors and risks?

- Conversion rate (i.e., operating efficiency)
- Depends on equipment, operating conditions
- Utilization of cracker
- Massive fixed cost/capital investment
Estimating demand
- Selling locally is ideal
- Avoids transportation costs, tariffs, duties, etc.
- PE is a commodity with thin margins
- Price taker on input prices (Ethane)
- Output price determined by market (little pricing power)
- Question: Are these business factors specific to Argentina?
- Have they built them into the cash flows?
- Forecasted cash flows are expectations and include planned operational changes
Cyclicality of demand and various prices built into the forecasts
Are there other risks?

# Potential country risks

- Currency risk
- Argentina has a long history of sovereign defaults and currency crises
- Expropriation risk
- Argentine government takes all or part of investment
- Tax risk
- Government could increase taxes (on sales, profits, inputs, etc.)
- Repatriation risk
- Government could restrict access to cash flows or ability to repatriate profits
- Capital controls are common in crises
Regulatory risk
- Could impose pricing or supplier restrictions

# How should we incorporate the various risks?

- Do the forecasted cash flows capture these risks?
- In U.S., Dow uses a discount rate of  $8 - 10\%$  (already captures beta)
- Would anyone use a discount rate of  $10\%$  for Argentina in 1995?
- What risk premium would you add to debt, equity or WACC (as in Goldman model)?
- Let's take a poll
- What information do we have in the case to adjust the discount rate?
- Sovereign spread between Argentina and the U.S. (Exhibit 12)
- About 1000 bps (or  $10\%$ )
- Sovereign spread reflects various country risks

# Scenario analysis

- Core idea: Consider explicit risks
- Bad outcome: Expropriation or currency crisis and drop in demand
- Scenario 1: Argentina experiences serious economic turmoil at the end of 2002
- Government expropriates Dow, which has to abandon the facilities
- Scenario 2: Assume a currency crisis
- How did you handle these?
- Scenario 1: Could be handled in the cash flows
- Scenario 2: Currency risk is tied to Argentina's sovereign and difficult to model in the cash flows
- Discount rate adjustments for currency risk are common
- But let's think some more about the currency risks

# Risks revisited: Currency crisis

- What would be the impact of a currency devaluation in this case?
- Inputs and outputs are all international commodities with prices in dollars
- Variable costs of plant are in local currency
- So, variable costs would even decrease
- More generally: During a currency or financial crisis, would you rather own a sovereign bond or a plant in Argentina?
- Relevant risks are quite different

What might we be missing?

- Currency crisis likely affects local demand negatively
- What option would Dow have?

Export backstop

- Impact on profitability?
- What discount rate did you use for the scenarios?

# Outcome of Dow's Bid for PBB

- Dow won bid for  $51 \%$ of PBB with an offer of $357.5M
- Dow reportedly used  $10 \%$ as discount rate
- If you scale  $51 \%$ up to  $100 \%$ they bid close to firststage NPV
- Proceeded to execute all 3 stages
- In 1996: Dow bought remaining stakes in PBB & Polisur; began construction of an ethylene cracker and polyethylene plant
- In 2001: Polyethylene production began in new plant
- Dow's total investment in the Bahia Blanca complex, including all three stages of the project, was $1.5 billion
- In 2002, Argentina faces currency crisis:
- Argentina abandoned fixed exchange rate and peso fell sharply
- However, Dow's PE business performed extremely well throughout and subsequent to the crisis in Argentina
- Key to Dow's success was that Dow could export PE that it could not sell locally
- In general, exporters with local costs did well subsequent to depreciation

# Summing up

- Be explicit about what certain risks would do to your business or target – Crises often create winners and losers
- In many settings, foreign investors (FDI or portfolio) are better positioned because of their access to global product or capital markets
- Export backdrop
- Foreign multinationals are often not expropriated because they would be a "prominent victim"
- Thus, some of the typical country risks might not apply to your investment
- Think specifically about "bad" outcomes rather than simple adjustments to discount rates

# Summing up (cont.)

- At a minimum, assess whether implied CF consequences and valuation discount seem plausible
- Increasing the discount rate penalizes long-term investments and skews incentives in favor of short-term ones
- Given how difficult it is to properly adjust the discount rate, try hard to first handle risks in the expected cash flows using scenarios
- It might be better to have "messy" conversations about specific risks that your foreign investment faces
- Modelling risks in the cash flows brings people in operations into the conversation
- But: Remember to then "dial-down" discount factor (double counting)

# International Accounting Differences

# IFRS adoption worldwide

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are the de-facto global reporting language
- Over 100 jurisdictions require IFRS for all or most domestic publicly accountable entities in their capital markets
- Over 90 percent of them also require or permit IFRS for (at least some) unlisted companies

Major "hold-outs"

- USA: IFRS permitted for non-US filers
- About 500 non-US filers provide IFRS (without US GAAP reconciliation)
- Japan: Voluntary IFRS adoption permitted and encouraged
- China: Chinese GAAP have been made largely consistent with IFRS

# IFRS – US GAAP differences

- Many differences between IFRS and US GAAP remain
- Being bilingual has become increasingly important
- Especially for M&A
- However, many of the differences are fairly technical and often may not be material
- Standards have substantially converged
- While US adoption is off the table for now, FASB and IASB often coordinate on new standards
- But: Differences can exist even for joint projects

Examples:

- Expected credit loss model (CECL)
- Leases
- Some differences between IFRS and US GAAP are likely to persist for the foreseeable future

# US GAAP allows "Program Accounting"

- Example: Boeing follows program accounting, but Airbus cannot
- Program Accounting
- Theory behind program accounting is that with each program or model, production cost per unit will fall over time due to volume efficiencies and learning effects
- Company managers determine a block size on which they can credibly estimate revenues and costs
- Spread costs and revenues over a block of deliveries
- Note that the company may be forced to recognize charges if:
- It does not sell as many aircraft as initially expected
- Price of the aircraft drops or the costs associated with production are higher than anticipated
- Think about the events regarding the 737 Max or coronavirus

# Program accounting and Boeing

- Boeing's 2017 10-K
- Critical Accounting Policies:
- "Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity."
- "Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity (firm orders and market studies), sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs."
- "Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins."

# Airbus and IFRS

- Airbus follows IFRS, which
- requires inventories to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value
- records the cost of goods sold on a job-order basis for each commercial aircraft it has manufactured and sold
- does not allow contract and program accounting that helps firms defer costs of the goods or services, and recognize profits sooner

- Search illustrates that analysts often ignore accounting differences
- Some analysts make adjustments (but rarely provide details about them)
- Magnitude of the differences are difficult to predict
- Differences likely matter more multiples than in DCF models

# Peer group comparison for tobacco companies

Exhibit 18 puts the question in context by comparing BATS operating margins to the broad (ROW & USA) peer group, on the basis of latest year performance. The big picture is that BATS is now up with the pack, having been a clear laggard a decade ago. And when compared with ROW leader PMI on a comparable, GAAP-restated basis, margins are quite close.

BATS 2013 Annual Report (Page 126)

- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is based on the weighted average cost incurred in acquiring inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition, which will include raw materials, direct labor and overheads, where appropriate. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less costs to completion and sale. Tobacco inventories which have an operating cycle that exceeds 12 months are classified as current assets, consistent with recognized industry practice.
- Weighted Average Cost Method is a middle of the road approach between FIFO and LIFO

# Ask: Relevant IFRS vs. US GAAP differences?

- Inventory accounting:
- IFRS: LIFO is prohibited. Can use FIFO or weighted average
- US GAAP: LIFO is accepted (required if LIFO is used for tax purposes)
- Internally developed R&D:
- IFRS: Research costs are expensed, while internally developed intangible assets are generally capitalized and amortized, according to IAS 38
- US GAAP: R&D costs are generally expensed as incurred according to ASC 730
- Some notable exceptions exist that might be relevant to the auto industry (e.g., software developed for internal use)
- Pension accounting:
- IFRS: Amortization of actuarial pension gain/loss is not allowed
- US GAAP: Amortization of actuarial pension gain/loss is allowed if it exceeds certain threshold

# Inventories -

Inventories are valued at cost, not in excess of net realizable value, cost being determined on the "average-cost" basis, except for the cost of finished products carried by certain subsidiary companies which is determined on the "specific identification" basis or "last-in, first-out" ("LIFO") basis. Inventories valued on the LIFO basis totaled ¥433,802 million and ¥472,717 million at March 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Had the "first-in, first-out" basis been used for those companies using the LIFO basis, inventories would have been ¥40,650 million and ¥22,778 million higher than reported at March 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

# Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

All these derivatives are initially recognized as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value, when Honda becomes a party to the contractual provision of the derivatives. Subsequent changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in profit or loss in the period of the changes.

Honda has not held any derivatives designated as hedging instruments for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018.

NaN. Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the consolidated statements of financial position, only when Honda currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts, and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

(e) Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories includes purchase costs and conversion costs, and it is determined principally by using the first-in first-out method. Conversion cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads on the normal operation capacity. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

All inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost for a substantial portion of U.S. inventories is determined on a last-in, first-out ("LIFO") basis. LIFO was used for  $27\%$  and  $30\%$  of total inventories at December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

# Inventory Accounting: LIFO vs. FIFO

- Cash flows are not affected by company's choice of LIFO and FIFO
- Based on the assumption that costs continue to rise, LIFO would increase COGS on the income statement, and decrease Net Income
- The company's profitability ratios (gross profit margin and return on assets) will be smaller under LIFO than FIFO

COGS under FIFO method = COGS under LIFO - Δ LIFO reserve

- Based on the assumption that costs continue to rise, using LIFO likely increases the LIFO reserve and the difference between FIFO and LIFO – Adjustment to Inventory and hence Total Assets
- Total Asset (FIFO) = Total Asset (LIFO) + LIFO reserve
- What is a common concern with LIFO accounting?

-LIFO liquidations

What do you think about this? Use LIFO income and FIFO assets

- It actually is the way to approximate current profitability!

# US GAAP vs. IFRS: Inventory Accounting

- You can convert Ford to FIFO but not the other way around!

# Development Costs

IFRS : Audi 2018 Annual Report : Page 108

- The research and development activities of the Audi Group came to EUR 4,178 (3,809) million in the year under review. This represents a research and development ratio of 7.1 (6.4) percent. The year-on-year rise is attributable to increased investment in automated and autonomous driving as well as in expanding the portfolio of hybrid and electric vehicles. Capitalized development costs rose to EUR 1,593 (1,243) million – equivalent to a capitalization ratio of 38.1 (32.6) percent. This ratio expresses capitalized development costs in relation to total research and development activities. Amortization of capitalized development costs totaled EUR 856 (1,025) million in the 2018 fiscal year.

US GAAP : GM 2018 Annual Report : Page 53

- Research and development expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other cost of sales, were  $7.8 billion,$ 7.3 billion and $6.6 billion in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. We enter into cost sharing arrangements with third parties or nonconsolidated affiliates for product-related research, engineering, design and development activities.

# Pension Accounting

# Actuarial Gains/Losses (IFRS): Daimler AG

Example : Daimler AG Group's 2018 10K

- Actuarial losses from defined benefit pension plans recognized in retained earnings of €1.5 billion (Page 101)
- "The calculations are subject to various assumptions on matters such as current actuarially developed probabilities (e.g. discount factors and cost-of-living increases), future fluctuations with regard to age and period of service, and experience with the probability of occurrence of pension payments, annuities or lump sums." (Page 254)
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income/Loss (Page 229)

Net profit 7,582

Other comprehensive income/loss, net of taxes -2,516

Items that may be reclassified to profit/loss -1,059

Items that will not be reclassified to profit/loss -1,457

Actuarial gains/losses from pensions and similar obligations (after tax) -1,456

Total comprehensive income 5,066

# Actuarial Gains/Losses (US GAAP): GM

Example : GM's 2018 10K

- At December 31, 2018  $2.1 billion of the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss is outside the corridor (primarily \(10\%$  of the projected benefit obligation (PBO)) and subject to amortization. The weighted-average amortization period is approximately sixteen years resulting in amortization expense of \)0.1 billion in 2019. (Page 40)
- Estimated amounts to be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost in the year ending December 31, 2019 based on December 31, 2018 plan measurements are $129 million, consisting primarily of amortization of the net actuarial loss in the non-U.S. pension plans. (Page 75)
- Thus, approximately $0.1 billion in expenses were recognized in the Income Statement, only because GM reports under US GAAP
- Consider using operating margin as it is unaffected by Actuarial Gains/Losses and hence IFRS/US GAAP difference does not matter

# IFRS adoption worldwide

- International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) has become the de-facto global reporting language
- Has eliminated many accounting differences

US GAAP and IFRS are the key differences to worry about

- Key differences between IFRS and US GAAP are likely to persist for the foreseeable future
- New differences can arise as the standards evolve (e.g., leasing)
- Important "side-bar"
- Statutory reporting often still follows local GAAP

E.g., a non-listed private subsidiary

E.g., parent-only accounts

Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG), based in Munich, Germany, is the parent company of the BMW Group. The comments on the BMW Group and Automotive segment provided in earlier sections are also relevant for BMW AG, unless presented differently in the following section. The Financial Statements of BMW AG are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the relevant supplementary provisions contained in the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

# 'Apples to Apples' approach at Morgan Stanley

- "Valuation is the biggest challenge for global investing"
- Accounting is key part of the challenge
- Adopted "apples to apples approach" prior to worldwide IFRS adoption
- Made adjustments by industry so that we are at least comparing green apples to red apples, rather than apples to oranges
- Goal was to get a comparable view into the economics of the firm
- MS later adopted "ModelWare" approach
- Spent a lot of time harmonizing definitions
- Shows that similar comparability problems arise even for US companies
- Credit Suisse HOLT approach has similar goal – make economics comparable

CFROI is defined as the average economic return on all of a company's investment projects in a given year. It is a multi-year concept, close to the IRR of the existing projects

# Accounting differences and valuation

- Accounting differences should not matter for valuation
- Ideally, two firms with the same underlying economics have the same valuation
- But the challenge is that accounting differences could skew your view of key value drivers and the underlying economics
- This problem is not limited to differences in accounting standards
- Arises also due to shenanigans

Non-GAAP reporting

- Accounting differences likely matter more for multiples than DCF models
- With a multiple, you take a single accounting number and scale it up
- FCFs "unravel" or undo the accruals
- Remember what we discussed for the economic profit model:
- Accounting differences reverse

# Accounting differences and valuation (cont.)

- Important: Not all accounting differences come from accounting standards
- E.g., Japanese carmakers are known to have conservative depreciation choices
- But they could retain their depreciation policies if they reported under US GAAP or IFRS
- Differences are also created by firm choices, not by accounting standards
- You also need to review accounting choices (not just for foreign firms)
- Firms' incentives to inform investors about their underlying economics probably matter as much as the standards
- Back to the information risks with foreign investments
- The core issue is not (and never was) the standards, but differences in companies' willingness to provide information

# Information Risks and Reporting Incentives

# Information quality and accounting shenanigans

- Firms "manage" their numbers
- Earnings
- Leverage or equity
- Other performance metrics (e.g., KPIs)
- Techniques or practices
- Earnings management around benchmarks and targets (e.g., analyst forecasts)
- Smoothing over time
- Reluctance to recognize losses in a timely fashion
- There are many motives for these shenanigans
- How pervasive are accounting shenanigans by U.S. companies compared to the rest of the world?

- The correlation in the scores across time is very high (> 0.70)
The rank order of countries has not much changed over the years

# What determines corporate transparency or opacity?

- There are persistent country clusters based on countries' institutional framework (e.g., investor protection, corporate governance, etc.)
- Important positive factors
- High-quality auditing
- Strong corporate governance
- Strong legal enforcement
- Strong supervisory agency (e.g., SEC)
Shareholder litigation

- Strong capital markets and public scrutiny
- Important negative factors
- Concentrated ownership structure and insider (or family) control
- Political connections

# What about IFRS Adoption?

- Empirical analyses on previous slide ended in 2005, which is when many countries adopted IFRS
- What do you think the effect of IFRS adoption was?
- Compared to prior legalistic and tax-influenced standards in Continental Europe, Asia, South America and Africa, IFRS are intended to:
- Reflect economic substance more than legal form
- Reflect economic gains and losses in a more timely fashion
- Make financial statements more informative and require substantial disclosures
- But remember what shapes corporate transparency
- Why would (solely) changing the standards have much of an effect?

# Impediments to harmonization

- Uneven Adoption
- Countries modify IFRS to conform to local economic conditions & politics

-E.g., EU created carve-outs for fair value accounting

- HSBC 2012 Annual Report: "Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU"
- Uneven Implementation
- Local economic conditions and political forces matter for implementation
- European Commission tracks implementation:

"Italy has the worst record of all European Union member states when it comes to implementing the laws that underpin the EU's internal market, according to data released by the European Commission yesterday…. The worst performers apart from Italy are Luxembourg, Greece, the Czech Republic and Portugal."

(FT, July 19, 2005)

- Uneven enforcement

# Key take-aways

- IFRS are unlikely to (fully) harmonize financial reporting behavior
- There are still major reporting differences in practice
- Information risk and transparency differences persist
- Differences in implementation, enforcement and application have replaced old rule differences
- Differences are potentially swept under the "IFRS rug"
- New differences are potentially more subtle
- Use of discretion depends on management's reporting incentives that are very different across countries and firms
- Institutional factors & firm-level governance continue to matter
- There can be "good" or "bad" reporting under any accounting standard

Firms can provide additional disclosures

# New Variation in Corporate Reporting: Non-GAAP Metrics

# Defining the numbers: Non-GAAP reporting

- Pro-forma earnings
- Historically, the term referred to "what if" scenarios (e.g., after business combinations or divestitures)
- Also refers to earnings with "GAAP deviations"
- Other terms: Street earnings, core earnings, key metrics, KPI
We will use the term "non-GAAP reporting"

- Important to know:
- Firms are free to define metrics for their business
- Non-GAAP numbers are not audited
- Non-GAAP reporting has become the new normal for most firms

Guidance is typically provided for the non-GAAP numbers

- This practice leads to "new" accounting differences

# "New variation"

- Examples of companies in same sector that treat amortization differently

# WeWork: "Community Adjusted EBITDA"

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/7ae4ace4-50b5-4304-b83f-eb87c360329b/919f6be26cc0a78d20ea6092954e5032f70fb684b19cf32d946ffbc5ae284ef2.jpg)

Data: WeWork; Chart: Axios Visuals

WeWork devised "Community Adjusted EBITDA" to measure net income before not only interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, but also "buildingand community-level operating expenses," a category that includes rent and tenancy expenses, utilities, internet, the salaries of building staff, and the cost of building amenities (which WeWork described as "our largest category of expenses").

# Common practice

- More than  $90\%$  of S&P500 firms use non-GAAP metrics between 2015-2017
- By 2017,  $97 \%$ presented at least one non-GAAP metric
- In 1996, there were only about  $56 \%$
- Numbers that are most commonly adjusted:
- Income and EPS (82% and 79%, respectively)
- Many management compensation plans are based on EPS, and often based on non-GAAP EPS
- Discretion can be used to influence compensation
- For the most part, non-GAAP numbers eliminate significant expenses & charges

– For the 260 firms in the S&P 500 that reported both types of numbers, total non-GAAP net income was $80.6 billion higher than GAAP income

# Non-GAAP Reporting Revisited

# How should we think about non-GAAP reporting?

- This practice leads to "new" accounting differences
- Despite US GAAP, firms start defining their numbers on their own

# Pros

- Can help investors to better understand performance as well as predict future performance:
- Identifies 'core' or recurring earnings
- Comparisons are hampered by nonrecurring items (across time and firms)

# Cons

- Increases the burden on investors and "undoes" standardization via GAAP
Non-GAAP reporting clearly has the potential to mislead investors

- Can be a substitute for manipulation of GAAP numbers

# Special items can be material (but also recurring)

% of Companies: Special Items > 10% of Cash Flows

Most Frequent Special Items<sup>1</sup>

# Example for potential to mislead

- Delphi created a non-GAAP measure: "operating cash flow"
- Pretty close in name to GAAP construct
- But their definition was quite special:

Operating CF = net income + depreciation & other non-cash charges - capex + "others"

- The "others" bucket was very large and included routine operating uses of cash such as pension plan contributions, payment to employees, decline in the sales of account receivables
- In 2003, Delphi reported a GAAP loss
- "Operating cash flow" = $1,220M
- CFFO = $737M in same year
- FCF = - $\$ 268$ M
- Compare FCF and "Operating cash flow" (which is constructed like a FCF)

# Which view does the evidence support?

- Evidence that non-GAAP earnings often have higher relevance for forecasting than GAAP earnings
- Makes sense:
- Stripping out one-time charges should be useful
- Most companies intend to inform investors, i.e., help them understand their numbers
- But: There is also evidence for opportunistic practices
- Companies report earnings and financials for accountability too
- Study by Curtis, McVay and Whipple (TAR 2014)
- "We conclude that the most pervasive motivation to disclose non-GAAP earnings in the presence of transitory gains is to inform."
- "An economically significant proportion of firms, however, appear opportunistic in that they only disclose non-GAAP earnings information when it increases investors' perceptions of core operating earnings."

- Why is this practice potentially more concerning?

# Rules for Non-GAAP reporting

- SEC term: Non-GAAP financial measures
- Regulation G: Effective March 2003
- GAAP figures need to be given equal prominence
- Companies must reconcile non-GAAP measure to GAAP earnings
- On average, firms in S&P 500 provide 9 reconciling lines
- Applies to press releases, conference calls, web casts, presentations, etc.
- So Reg G is quite extensive
- Irrespective of Reg G: Disclosures should not be misleading
- If they are misleading, other prohibitions may apply
- SEC basically recognizes the tradeoff between:
- Helping investors understand the business and forecast earnings
- Shenanigans targeted at investors' impressions, interpretations and expectations

# Can you get in trouble for non-GAAP reporting?

SEC strengthened its enforcement in 2016

- Trump Casino reported "pro forma earnings" of $14 million for Q3 1999
 – This number excluded “one time” charges of $81.4 million
- But it included "one time" gains of $17.2 million
- Trump Casino stock increased by  $7.8\%$  on the day of the press release, then fell by  $6\%$  three days later when the one-time gain was revealed
- Trump Casino was "disciplined" by the SEC for this reporting practice
- Sent comment letters to companies
- Tesla changed its practices after pressure from the SEC

# Modeling issues with CBCV

- Heterogeneity of customers

– Firms go from customers with strongest product-market fit to weakest

Key variables (churn, CAC) tend to get worse as we move forward in time

- Do I have sufficient info to capture or model this heterogeneity?
- CBCV typically uses static modeling assumptions
- Within a cohort, churn rates likely vary over time
- Across cohorts, churn and CAC likely vary too
- Blue Apron suggested they had network effects
- Investors may have assumed declining CAC and improving retention over time
- But even flat CAC and flat retention were too generous
- Ask: Does it matter to me if my neighbor or friend uses Blue Apron?
- Neighbor: Economies of scale  $\neq$  network effects
- Friend: CAC benefits from word-of-mouth  $\neq$  network effects

# Common errors (Mauboussin)

- Assuming stable churn. Retention rates generally follow a curve so the average of a cohort can lead to an improper valuation. Retention rates can vary.
- Assuming customer homogeneity. The types of customers that engage with a company change over time. The economic value created by current customers tends to be very skewed as a small percentage of customers create a large percentage of value.
- Assuming CAC does not change. You must think about marginal CAC. CAC tends to rise per adopter categories. CAC can decline when network effects are sufficient to make one business dominant.
- Failure to discount future cash flows. Some companies and investors present future cash flows without discounting them to a present value. This has the obvious effect of overstating customer lifetime value.
- Failure to model all the way from sales to shareholder value. Blunt measures such as LTV/CAC fail to reflect meaningful determinants of shareholder value. The virtue of customer-based corporate valuation (CBCV) is that it considers all drivers of shareholder value.

# SaaS Valuation

# SaaS business model

- Business model:
- Develop, host, and update a software product
- License the product to customers via a subscription plan (recurring payments)

Key metrics:

- ARR (annualized recurring revenue) and RPO (remaining performance obligations)
- Metrics like net income or EBITDA are less useful because they are usually negative until the company matures
- Importance of revenue recognition
- ASC 606: Requires subscription revenue to be recognized when the firm satisfies a "performance obligation"
- Prior standard required revenue to be recognized ratably over the life of the contract
- ASC 606 typically leads to earlier revenue recognition
The unbilled revenue of a contract becomes the RPO = Indication of future revenue

- Some recognition of revenue up front
- RPO in Year 1 = Sum of future revenues

Note: For the analysis we use a 3-stage DCF model. We assume  $10\%$  growth rate in the first stage (year 1-5), then fade the growth rate over years 6-10 to a terminal growth rate of  $3.5\%$ . We vary the WACC from  $10\%$  to  $3.6\%$ .

# SaaS valuation (using sales multiple)

- Common method for valuing SaaS firms is using a multiple based off of ARR:
- ARR x Multiple = Value

Key factors for adjusting the multiple:

- Growth, TAM (total addressable market), revenue retention, CAC (customer acquisition cost), gross margins

TAM estimates:

–S1 estimated unified communications (UC) market @ $43bn by 2022

J.P. Morgan estimates TAM of  $\sim 40$ bn

-TAM could increase with use case expansions (education, phone)

- Morgan Stanley estimates TAM of \(100bn+ due to a combination of traditional UC market + combined education and UC market
- Stock price went from $207 in June to $337 in December 2020

# Wrapping Up

# Core themes of the class

- Concepts and tools that are widely applicable when analyzing companies – Relevant for strategy analysis too
- Understanding the business is key to financial analysis and valuation
- But you need to also understand the firm quantitatively
- Value drivers, unit economics and economic profit
- Long-run is what matters for firm value
- A couple years of high profits won't move the dial
- Think about moats, but connect it with economic profit & value creation in TV
- Forecasting the next couple years is meant to help you build an expectation for the long run NOPAT or FCF

# Core themes of the class

- Multiples require comparability and are anything but simple
- Do not get you away from challenges in DCF
- Valuation is a not about a "single" number, but understanding risks, ranges of outcomes and interdependencies
- Scenario analysis, reverse engineering, etc.
- Accounting numbers and how they are generated matter a great deal
- Shape your views of economics and value creation
- Form the basis of and influence your expectations
- Companies engage in shenanigans to influence impressions & expectations
- Legal institutions and corporate governance play a key role
- Accounting differences arise not just across countries, but also across companies within a country (e.g., non-GAAP)
