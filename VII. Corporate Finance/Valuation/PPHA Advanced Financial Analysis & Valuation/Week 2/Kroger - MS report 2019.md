# Business Strategy and Outlook 18 Jan 2019

Of the traditional grocers, we believe Kroger is uniquely positioned to defend its returns against a competitive onslaught that should intensify as Amazon, hard discounters, and mass merchandisers price aggressively to increase volume. Though industry factors are diminishing its competitive standing, we contend that Kroger still benefits from enduring intangible assets and cost advantages.

Grocers use price as a primary lever to drive traffic, which we believe necessitates efficiency and cost leverage (spurred by high traffic) to deliver returns. We expect this environment to endure as the industry changes, with an omnichannel experience likely to prevail as customers use a combination of deliver-to-home, click-and-collect, and in-store shopping, particularly since most American consumers drive past grocers on their commutes and home delivery can be inconvenient for buyers with uncertain schedules. In physical retail, we anticipate that shoppers will use a variety of sellers to meet their needs based on convenience, price, and breadth of assortment, demanding high value as well as a compelling store environment.

We believe Kroger should be able to capitalize on the changing landscape. We maintain that Kroger's local market scale allows it to derive cost leverage that fuels competitive pricing as well as the investments needed to build on its already-considerable presence in each of the emerging channels. In our view, its progress should be accelerated by partnerships (with Ocado, Walgreens, Microsoft, and others) that we do not believe are available to smaller rivals because they cannot deliver the same value to counterparts.

Kroger's data-related efforts should play a large role in its embrace of the new grocery landscape, fueling promotional efforts and customer engagement while informing assortment and providing saleable insights that can create alternative revenue streams. We expect data to play a key role in retailers' efforts to drive traffic, efficiency, and conversion, and anticipate that Kroger's long, intimate relationship with its numerous customers (96% of sales are tied to a loyalty card) has created a monetizable asset that few rivals can match.

# Profile

Kroger is the leading American grocer, with 2,782 supermarkets operating under several banners throughout the country as of the end of fiscal 2017. Around  $82\%$  of stores have pharmacies, while over half also sell fuel. The company also operated 274 fine jewelry stores at the end of fiscal 2017. Kroger features a leading private-label offering and manufactures around a third of its own-brand units (and  $44\%$  of its grocery own-label assortment) itself, in 37 food production plants nationwide. Kroger is a top-two grocer in 46 of the 52 major markets in which it operates along with 54 of its 73 secondary markets (as of the end of fiscal 2017, according to IRI data). Virtually all of Kroger's sales come from the United States.

# Morningstar Analysis

Kroger's Strong Competitive Standing Should Help It Navigate a Fast-Changing, Competitive Landscape 18 Jan 2019

We are lifting our valuation for narrow-moat Kroger to \$31 per share from \$29.50, mostly reflecting the time value of money. We believe Kroger's intangible assets (including vendor relationships, strong store banners, industry-leading transaction data and analytics capabilities, and a top-tier private-label lineup) and favorable cost position will help it capitalize on a rapidly shifting grocery environment. However, competition is intensifying, leading us to think that the firm's edge is dulling somewhat.

Unlike its pure-play peers, we believe Kroger can succeed in the new grocery paradigm. With local market scale sufficient to drive the cost leverage needed to hold prices down and fuel omnichannel investments, we suspect Kroger should be able to use its well-located store network to economically meet customers' demands digitally and conventionally. We believe its size and strong management team have enabled the partnerships it has prudently struck with firms such as Microsoft and Walgreens, which we expect to accelerate its omnichannel development and that we contend are enabled by the value it can deliver as America's largest pure-play grocer. Furthermore, Kroger's partnership with European online grocery leader Ocado should allow it to serve digital orders more efficiently while unlocking markets where it does not have a large presence. Additionally, Kroger's stores of transaction data should allow it to optimize promotions and assortment while also selling insights to packaged goods firms.

Considering these factors and the firm's strong private-label assortment, we suspect that rather than Kroger, subscale retailers should bear the brunt of market share pressure from newcomers. We expect  $2.6\%$  revenue growth against  $2.5\%$  adjusted operating margins on average from fiscal 2019-27. With shares trading near our valuation, we suggest investors wait before building a position in a grocer we see

as uniquely able to capitalize on shifting conditions.

We are tempering our moat trend rating to negative from stable, reflecting persistent competitive pressures that should result in ongoing price headwinds and necessitate continued investment to deliver a strong omnichannel experience. Although we contend that Kroger is better positioned than its traditional grocery peers, it is not immune to the price competition that has constrained top-line growth and profitability. While we have a favorable view of management's Restock Kroger optimization initiative, we believe the need to reinvest savings behind low prices as well as the plan's reliance on new alternative revenue streams to achieve the targeted \(400 million of incremental operating income by fiscal 2020 suggests a more tempered outlook until results materialize. Still, we anticipate the plan will enable Kroger to hold adjusted operating margins fairly constant despite the challenging environment, with our forecasts calling for less than 5 basis points of deterioration between fiscal 2018 and 2027.

# Fair Value & Profit Drivers 18 Jan 2019

We are lifting our valuation for Kroger to  \$31 per share from\$ 29.50, reflecting the time value of money and solid third-quarter earnings. Our valuation implies forward fiscal 2019 enterprise value/adjusted EBITDA of 7 times and adjusted P/E of 13.

With the firm's promotional targeting efforts building, we anticipate identical sales excluding fuel stabilizing at a little over  $2 \%$ long term, near our longterm expectations for food inflation despite intensifying competition forcing prices lower. We anticipate the company's plans to curb square footage growth will persist for the foreseeable future, averaging less than 50 basis points over the next decade. Combined, supermarket sales excluding fuel should expand an average  $2 \%$ over the next decade, near our normalized expectations for fuel revenue (though yeartoyear gasoline and diesel performance should vary considerably with commodity volatility and consumers' driving habits).

Together with faster-growing offerings such as digital coupons and data analytics, we expect long-term average revenue growth of around  $2.6\%$  from fiscal 2019-27.

Despite cost leverage, Restock Kroger-related savings, and highly lucrative data-related sales, we anticipate the need to keep prices low in light of intense competition will keep operating margins fairly steady at around  $2.4\%$  long term, with diminishing gross margins offset by slower operating, general, and administrative expense growth. While this would leave the firm short of its \$400 million incremental adjusted operating income growth target for fiscal 2020 (excluding convenience stores, we expect most savings will be reinvested and anticipate it will take time for new digital service offerings to bear fruit), the initiative should leave Kroger better suited to maintaining margins and adjusted returns on invested capital (9% forecast long term) in an intensely competitive environment.

While Kroger will likely pursue additional partnerships and bolt-on acquisitions (such as its 2018 purchase of meal-kit seller Home Chef), we do not incorporate such deals into our valuation because of their uncertain nature and timing.

Instead, we anticipate that Kroger returns excess capital to shareholders, with dividends and stock buybacks accounting for about  $10\%$  of free cash flow by the end of our explicit forecast, rising as capital expenditures stabilize at around  $2.3\%$  of sales (versus  $2.7\%$  on average over the past five years) amid slower store unit growth.

# Scenario Analysis

We assign Kroger a medium uncertainty rating. Shopping behaviors are changing rapidly as the rise of digital grocery upends consumer habits and introduces new, well-funded competitors. Amazon particularly looms (bolstered by Whole Foods), as ship-to-home effectively nationalizes the grocery competitive landscape, disadvantageing incumbents in individual markets while creating relatively low-cost avenues for entry into new regions for large sellers. These changing dynamics could work to Kroger's detriment; however, they also may create new opportunities in parts of the United States in which the firm does not have a leading presence.

In a downside case, the already-robust competition could intensify more than we anticipate. Rather than the omnichannel experience we expect to dominate the grocery landscape, consumers could adopt ship-to-home more than we anticipate, with Kroger's Ocado partnership overwhelmed by declining physical store traffic and associated cost leverage. Kroger's private-label strength could be offset by hard discounters' continued expansion, as Aldi and Lidl have long featured high-quality own brands at deep discounts. Furthermore, Amazon could extend its house brand to food categories, alongside continued investment by Walmart in its offerings. Additionally, Amazon could target Kroger's customer base through physical stores more directly, either by changing the assortment at Whole Foods to include more branded goods or by introducing or acquiring another, more broadly oriented banner. Kroger could struggle to capitalize on its alternative revenue streams, particularly as rival retailers attempt to

use their own transaction data to improve sales targeting and efficiency while also exploring external monetization strategies. The competitive pressure with few alternative sources of revenue could further pollute the industry's already-unfavorable pricing environment, with deflation constraining already-tight margins and returns.

In this downside scenario, Kroger would see  $2.0\%$  10year compound average annual revenue growth (as opposed to  $2.2\%$  in the base case), with a  $2.0\%$  average operating margin over the next decade (relative to  $2.4\%$  in the base case), resulting in a fair value estimate of \$21.50 per share.

On the other hand, Kroger could thrive in a digital grocery age, capitalizing on its distribution strength, procurement horsepower, digital investments, partnerships, and ability to invest to meet changing customer needs with greater success than we anticipate. The firm's local market scale could translate better than we expect to an omnichannel market, allowing it to efficiently address demand from consumers that use a variety of grocery fulfillment methods. The Ocado partnership could unlock new markets for Kroger to target with an efficient ship-to-home architecture, without the cost of building (or acquiring) stores. Kroger's media and data analytics offerings could resonate with consumer packaged goods manufacturers to so great an extent that they make Kroger the partner of choice for sellers, bolstering vendor relationships in a difficult-to-replicate manner. Initiatives such as boosted search could monetize Kroger's valuable online properties such that it diversifies revenue sources meaningfully, while extending data analytics into fields such as healthcare could add to the firm's strength. Even in this scenario, Amazon would likely prove successful in online grocery; however, Kroger (together with Walmart) could find itself relatively and uniquely sheltered, with smaller grocers donating share to the major players faster than we anticipate. The pricing environment could stabilize, with Kroger's current cycle of

using incremental cost leverage to fuel low prices (and, by extension, store traffic) yielding to margin expansion as efficiency builds. Lastly, Kroger's own-label strength could develop such that its offerings become universally viewed similarly as branded items, providing margin benefits as well as opportunities to extend the labels abroad.

In this case, we see Kroger achieving 10-year compound average annual revenue growth of  $2.5\%$  with a  $2.8\%$  average adjusted operating margin over the same period. This scenario would result in a fair value estimate of \$41.50 per share.

# Economic Moat

We assign Kroger a narrow moat rating based on its intangible assets and a cost advantage. We assume that Kroger's returns on invested capital exceed our estimate of its weighted average cost of capital by roughly 200 basis points over the next decade, at just below  $9\%$ .

The U.S. grocery industry is highly competitive, with an already-intense rivalry among traditional grocery stores, mass merchandisers, and club stores inflamed by Amazon's recent acquisition of Whole Foods and broader push into the sector. Considering the price competition that permeates the industry, we believe there is an increasing premium on the cost leverage that scale affords, including in the emerging digital grocery realm. While this places most conventional grocers at a disadvantage, we contend that Kroger's scale, vast library of customer transaction data (amassed over decades), private-label strength (accounting for \$21 billion in fiscal 2017 revenue, or nearly 30% of unit sales), and advantaged locations set it apart from its rivals.

As the largest pure grocer in the United States (trailing only Walmart in overall grocery sales and at approximately double the revenue of number-two Albertsons), Kroger is uniquely positioned to capitalize on its size with vendors

while also leveraging costs. The scale advantages emerge at a local and national level.

Locally, Kroger held a number-one or number-two market share in 46 of the 52 major markets it operated in as of the end of fiscal 2017. We believe this scale is vital, as it allows a grocer to leverage distribution and advertising costs in a way that smaller competitors cannot. Kroger can use its transaction volume within a local area to keep trucks full and distribution centers operating at nearly full capacity. Subscale participants, including online sellers, are forced to incur similar costs, particularly since many products are perishable, without the turnover needed to maximize operating profits. Kroger turned inventory at 15 times in fiscal 2017, well ahead of Albertsons' roughly 10 times, which we believe is an indication of the economic benefits of scale even between the top two market participants. Furthermore, Kroger's leading local market position allows it to derive a better return on local advertising expenditures, with traditional media costs in the market spread over a larger sales base. (Kroger generated an average of around \$165 in sales for every advertising dollar it spent over the last three years, versus about \$120 for Albertsons.)

On a national level, we believe the firm's scale allows it to capitalize on the digitization of grocery. We believe an omnichannel approach is most likely to prevail in the sector, with customers using a combination of delivery to home, click-and-collect, and in-store sales to purchase their items. However, we believe the click-and-collect approach will be especially prevalent in the United States, as it is often more convenient for a customer who is already driving to or from work or other engagements to stop at a nearby grocer than schedule their lives around the arrival of a delivery of (often perishable) items. This should reward firms that can combine local market scale with cost leverage over national omnichannel investments (such as digital ordering platforms, distribution network optimization, and the

development of intimate relationships with vendors to ensure products are packaged in a way that is conducive to a variety of fulfillment options and presented in such a way that they carry appeal in person and in a picture online), as well as labor-saving initiatives, including automation and mobile-based checkout. Kroger's scope should allow it to manage the transition of trade spending; for example, the firm is already offering boosted search placements to food manufacturers, allowing them to pay to have their products listed at the top of search results in a high-impression, high-conversion venue.

Kroger's top line is roughly double that of Albertsons, the second-largest pure-play grocer in the United States, and we believe that has led its adjusted EBITDA margins to exceed its smaller rival's by about 60 basis points over the past three years, on average. We suspect the profitability differential is more pronounced against smaller rivals; the U.S. grocery industry is highly fragmented, with the top four grocers only holding about  $40\%$  market share and Kroger's management indicating that around  $45\%$  of the market is held by sellers without discernible economies of scale. We believe unscaled retailers will serve as share donors as digital and deep discount rivals grow. We contend that Kroger's ability to leverage distribution costs, investments in omnichannel offerings, and supply chain capabilities should allow it to continue to outperform its pure-play rivals. Additionally, we believe Kroger's in-house production of many of its private-label offerings bolsters its cost standing in addition to improving the quality of its assortment, with smaller rivals unable to justify the investment needed to follow the same path.

Kroger's scale fuels valuable intangible assets that we believe will be difficult for rivals to replicate. The company has met the challenge of digital grocery with partnerships with a variety of firms, tie-ups that we believe are enabled by Kroger's significant size, established market position,

and grocery industry leadership as it is uniquely positioned to deliver meaningful value to its counterparts. Kroger is testing a roughly 2,300-item own-branded product lineup at certain Walgreens locations, including its recently acquired Home Chef meal kits; working with Instacart on home delivery as a bridge to further developing its own capabilities; and using autonomous vehicle startup Nuro to send grocery orders to customers using a test fleet of driverless cars in Scottsdale, Arizona. Additionally, the firm announced a partnership with Microsoft in early 2019 that will see the two giants develop digital-rich stores and an as-a-service software suite that will be marketed to other retailers. We contend that these initiatives will ease Kroger's ongoing evolution, combining the firm's formidable scale with emerging approaches in a way that few rivals can match.

Perhaps most intriguingly, Kroger established an exclusive relationship with European online grocery leader Ocado in 2018, taking a mid-single-digit percentage stake in the firm. According to its filings, Kroger's investment in Ocado had a market value of \(544 million as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We believe the deal should significantly accelerate Kroger's development of its deliver-to-home and click-and-collect offerings, with Ocado's flexible, low-cost warehouse-based model extending Kroger's reach beyond its existing markets in a cost-efficient, tested manner. Ocado's highly automated warehouse approach should allow Kroger to compete effectively with Amazon, creating the flexibility to serve orders from dedicated centers that would not incur the same order picking costs that constrain profitability when fulfilling from a traditional store. Furthermore, the deal's exclusivity takes Ocado off the table as a potential partner for smaller retailers looking to quickly expand their delivery presence, while also foreclosing future direct competition with the digital seller.

On the private-label front, we believe Kroger's strong suite

of offerings is additive to the firm's intangible assets, bolstering its brand in consumers' eyes. Unlike rivals, Kroger manufactures around  $44\%$  of its own brand grocery offerings, allowing it to elevate quality while containing production costs. Its efforts have allowed Kroger to position its labels (particularly Simple Truth and Private Selection, which cater toward customers seeking clean-label and premium options) as a branded-equivalent alternative, often with flavors and characteristics that are not available elsewhere. Kroger's labels are the largest brands sold at its stores, accounting for roughly  $30\%$  of unit sales excluding fuel and pharmacy (ahead of a U.S. penetration rate of around  $15\% -20\%$ ). We believe the quality and value of Kroger's own labels spurs customer affinity for the stores while differentiating the assortment from rivals, bolstering the company's standing with shoppers (and traffic) even as the company sells meaningfully more lucrative product. The firm's move to introduce an assortment of own-brand products at Walgreens should extend the value of the brands further, and we have a favorable view of the company's efforts to capitalize on its  $\$ 2$  billion Simple Truth brand's strength and foreign label in China, where it is introducing a select lineup of products on Alibaba's Tmall site.

Kroger's grocery stores are often paired with fuel stations and a pharmacy, both of which we believe add recurring customer traffic and further embed the company's stores into shoppers' daily routines. Over  $80\%$  of Kroger's locations boast pharmacies and roughly half have fuel centers, initiatives which are difficult for rivals to implement from scratch.

We contend that Kroger's vast trove of customer data reflects and constitutes a powerful intangible asset that should unlock opportunities for targeted advertising and promotions, in-store advertising, assortment optimization, and analytics sales to vendors. Around  $96\%$  of its transactions are tied to a loyalty card, leaving Kroger with

# Morningstar Analysis

60 million households' worth of behavioral information and data that extends back years. We believe the robustness of this data set is the richest in the industry, giving Kroger lifecycle insight into shoppers' buying behaviors.

Kroger monetizes this information in a number of ways, with plans to significantly expand its use of data analytics and sell related insights underway (spearheaded by its in-house analytics firm, 84.51). Most readily, the company is able to use purchase history to target promotions and discounts, boosting customer engagement and traffic while increasing the return on its marketing investments and refining its local market assortment. Furthermore, the rewards program offers Kroger ways to incentivize traffic through fuel and recurring pharmacy sales by offering points and discounts based on purchases made.

We believe that Kroger can use its low-margin grocery business to fuel high-margin data, media, and personal finance (including credit card) revenue, somewhat analogous to wide-moat Costco's use of nearly break-even merchandise sales to drive the membership fees that constitute the majority of its operating income.

While several non-U.S. grocers that we cover carry no-moat ratings, we believe Kroger's capabilities and the nature of the American market have allowed it to maintain a competitive edge. The grocery sector in the United States is fragmented, leading us to believe that subscale retailers that have neither the cost leverage nor the ability to invest in the omnichannel experience and private label as Kroger are the likely market share donors for new and growing entrants (Amazon and the hard discounters). Combined with its data insights into the key U.S. market and the likelihood that click-and-collect and in-store shopping will remain relevant in the country (considering the prevalence of driving commutes), we contend that Kroger's unique combination of a strong store network, procurement leverage, and the

resources needed to keep pace with changing industry demands will keep it better-positioned than most of the pure grocers we cover. Taken together, we believe these factors contribute to an efficiency that underlies Kroger's  \$656 fiscal 2017 sales per square foot, which easily outperformed Albertsons' roughly\$ 520 and is ahead of all but Costco in our defensive retail coverage.

# Moat Trend

We are revising our moat trend rating to negative from stable, reflecting persistently intense grocery sector competition. While we contend that Kroger's budding data analytics capabilities, which should make it a more valued partner for vendors, will help it weather the storm better than other conventional grocers, we believe the challenging environment will force reinvestment, limiting its prospects for profitability and return expansion.

Competition in grocery is intensifying, with Amazon rapidly expanding in the space, mass merchandisers pricing aggressively to drive traffic to more lucrative parts of the store, and hard discounters targeting the U.S. market. We believe this will elevate the importance of local and national scale, with an increasingly evident need to use costs to maintain margins even in a market characterized by relentless price cutting. Still, we anticipate that Kroger is uniquely positioned to weather the storm, with its local market scale, omnichannel strength (spurred by the Ocado partnership and its quick expansion of click-and-collect and delivery), unique and high-quality private-label portfolio, and fuel offerings acting to preserve traffic. Because the future of grocery most likely lies in an omnichannel solution, we believe Kroger's advantaged network of store locations should continue to hold value, particularly for click-and-collect customers.

While hard discounters Lidl and Aldi are looking to expand significantly in the U.S. and feature a robust, high-quality,

aggressively priced private-label assortment, the results thus far have been mixed. Lidl has re-evaluated its growth effort, with store openings trailing its initial expansion targets, which we believe reflects the difficulty that new entrants face when competing in markets with grocers that have already achieved local scale. While Aldi's expansion, including a \$5 billion push into the market, is recent, the chain has been in the United States since the 1970s and has only amassed low-single-digit market share. Kroger has long competed successfully with Aldi, with half of its locations already near an Aldi store and strong recent market share growth despite the discounter's push. We suspect this is partially due to Kroger's own private-label quality and strong reputation, which blunts the differentiation that the discounters offer against other sellers. However, the discounters should give Kroger's shoppers more alternatives, diminishing its competitive standing somewhat over time.

We contend that Kroger's unique advantages leave it significantly better positioned to fend off a competitive onslaught that should come at the expense of smaller traditional grocers. Still, industry competition does create some downward pressure on Kroger's margins and returns.

To an extent, we believe this is offset by Kroger's emerging data capabilities. Kroger's media offering should be able to use an industry-leading data set to deliver meaningful insights for vendors, sharpening its assortment while boosting its value to food manufacturers with a particularly high-return offering (as Kroger should be better able to tie producers' actions to shoppers' buying decisions and assess repeat purchase frequency). The company is likely to be successful in its efforts to build on its already-strong targeted promotional activities to drive traffic, with higher-return promotions as shopper behavior and predictive analytics capabilities develop. Deeper analytics should also help Kroger target customers toward some of

its higher-margin categories. For example, the company is looking at ways it can use eating behavior to inform its health-related offerings, insights that can also be monetized externally. The data set should also be enriched by Kroger's credit card offerings.

Although Kroger's data and services offerings are a small part of its top line (less than  $5\%$ , we suspect) and will likely see growing pains as the firm becomes familiar with the new tools and products, the efforts should require little capital investment and be highly profitable. However, we believe they are not yet sufficiently large as to offset the broader adverse changes to the competitive landscape, leading us to suspect that Kroger's aggregated competitive standing is deteriorating.

- While the digitization of grocery has upended the industry, Kroger's size allows it to invest in the omnichannel experience, using its advantaged store network to capitalize on digital opportunities.  
Kroger's customer data set is among the best in retail; it should be able to use the information it has to target promotions, inform its assortment, and sell marketing insights.

# Bears Say

- Competition in grocery is fierce from digital and physical sellers alike, necessitating continued investment in the store experience and low prices to maintain store traffic.  
- While we believe the Restock Kroger plan is likely to generate meaningful savings, we suspect the firm will need to reinvest and keep prices low, leaving margins and returns steady.  
Rapid change in the sector is forcing Kroger to quickly adopt new business models (such as delivery, click-and-collect, and data analytics meant for sale to outside parties), putting a larger premium on nimble execution.

# Financial Strength

Kroger is in sound financial health, and we believe it should be able to finance the \$9 billion of capital investments from fiscal 2018 to 2020 that it plans for its Restock Kroger optimization initiative with internally generated funds. As the firm shifts focus to its omnichannel capabilities from store growth, we anticipate that needs will fall over the long term. Net debt has held at 2.1 to 2.6 times adjusted EBITDA over the last five years, and while we anticipate an uptick in fiscal 2018 (to around 2.8 times), management expects to return to its 2.3 to 2.5 times target over time. We expect this to happen in fiscal 2020. Management has long (and prudently) reiterated its commitment to investment-grade credit ratings, so we anticipate the metric falls to the low end of the range long term. Deleveraging should be enabled by the firm's move away from new store growth (capital expenditures expected to stabilize at around  $2.3\%$  of sales long term versus  $2.7\%$  on average over the last five years) and profit dollar growth, with free cash flow to the firm averaging about  $1.7\%$  of sales through our explicit forecast, up from  $0.7\%$  over the past five years. Kroger has a history of returning capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases; we expect that to continue. By the end of our explicit forecast, we assume Kroger returns about  $10\%$  of free cash flow to investors via dividends and share repurchases. Kroger will also likely pursue further partnerships or acquisitions to bolster its omnichannel efforts and meet changes in the grocery landscape; however, we do not incorporate such transactions because of their uncertain timing and nature.

# Risk & Uncertainty

A fast-changing grocery environment amid intense competition from physical and digital sellers in a sector with limited switching costs constitutes the primary threat to our outlook. Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 significantly altered the competitive landscape for Kroger and other grocers, dramatically reducing the time they have

to develop capabilities required to ensure continued performance in an omnichannel world. While we believe Kroger has done well to embrace the industry's future, consumer buying habits are unsettled as food purchases are increasingly nationalized, upending the traditional distanceand routine-based relationship between customers and grocers. The dynamic could work to Kroger's benefit or detriment; if execution is strong, it could benefit from smaller grocers' struggle to keep pace, but if its ability to retain customers falters, the chain could find itself with too many stores and persistently diminishing economics. We believe price competition in grocery will continue for the foreseeable future, necessitating scale-based economies and efficient execution; while we anticipate Kroger will meet the challenge, the stakes are high. Kroger's growing efforts to monetize its consumer data introduces risk as it grows in segments (such as media, market analysis for clients such as consumer packaged goods firms, and personal finance) outside of its core competency. Furthermore, while Kroger plans to sell data based on aggregated insights and not customer contact information or purchasing history, a breach could rapidly impair the value of its transaction information. With switching costs low, the importance of trust is high, so data breaches, which could also compromise customer payment information, or food-safety missteps in its private-label portfolio could have a meaningful impact on performance.

# Stewardship 18 Jan 2019

We assign management's stewardship of shareholder capital an Exemplary rating.

Rodney McMullen has been Kroger's CEO since January 2014, capping a career at the firm that started in 1978. We believe McMullen has operated the business well despite an intensely competitive environment that necessitates rapid change and strong execution. We have a favorable view of McMullen's moves to build Kroger's omnichannel offering, capitalizing on its store network and local market scale to keep the chain relevant in a digitized grocery landscape. Furthermore, we maintain that his pursuit of partnerships with Walgreens, Ocado, Microsoft, Instacart, and others have helped Kroger develop necessary competencies in alternative channels without adding to capital investment needs or incurring the associated growing pains to the same extent as a solely in-house strategy. Additionally, continuing efforts to capitalize on Kroger's vast transaction data library should help offset competitive pressures.

McMullen unveiled the Restock Kroger initiative in late 2017, targeting  \$400 million in incremental adjusted operating profit by fiscal 2020 (versus\$ 3.1 billion in fiscal 2017, excluding convenience stores and an extra week in the fiscal year). While we believe required price cuts will limit the bottom-line benefits of the program, we applaud management's efforts to use alternative income streams, data analytics, operational and procurement efficiencies, space optimization, and other tools to combat challenging market conditions (in addition to its plans to cut store count growth).

The firm divested its convenience store unit in 2018, netting just over \$2 billion for the business in a deal we viewed favorably from a valuation and strategic standpoint, as it allowed Kroger to refocus on its core activities. Part of the proceeds were used to buy a stake in Ocado, a leading

European online grocer, with the ensuing partnership (which is exclusive if certain performance criteria are met) meant to build a network of highly automated fulfillment centers as the two firms develop their digital sales capabilities in the United States. We view the partnership positively as it should accelerate Kroger's learning process with newer fulfillment methods.

Management has long used share buybacks and dividends to return capital to shareholders, repurchasing around \(5.4 billion over the past five years and paying \(20\%\) - \(25\%\) of earnings, respectively. Recent share buybacks have likely generally come near or below our valuation, and while Kroger has purchased stock at inopportune times in the more distant past, we believe it has wisely balanced shareholder capital return with investment into the business.

Kroger ties pay to performance well, with  $84\%$  of fiscal 2017 CEO compensation at risk (73% for other executives). Targets largely hew to Restock Kroger's objectives (cost savings, adjusted operating profit growth, free cash flow expansion); we especially applaud the consideration of Kroger's return on invested capital when determining management's performance.

# Analyst Notes

Kroger's Strong Competitive Standing Should Help It Navigate a Fast-Changing, Competitive Landscape 18 Jan 2019

We are lifting our valuation for narrow-moat Kroger to  \$31 per share from\$ 29.50, mostly reflecting the time value of money. We believe Kroger's intangible assets (including vendor relationships, strong store banners, industry-leading transaction data and analytics capabilities, and a top-tier private-label lineup) and favorable cost position will help it capitalize on a rapidly shifting grocery environment. However, competition is intensifying, leading us to think that the firm's edge is dulling somewhat.

Unlike its pure-play peers, we believe Kroger can succeed in the new grocery paradigm. With local market scale sufficient to drive the cost leverage needed to hold prices down and fuel omnichannel investments, we suspect Kroger should be able to use its well-located store network to economically meet customers' demands digitally and conventionally. We believe its size and strong management team have enabled the partnerships it has prudently struck with firms such as Microsoft and Walgreens, which we expect to accelerate its omnichannel development and that we contend are enabled by the value it can deliver as America's largest pure-play grocer. Furthermore, Kroger's partnership with European online grocery leader Ocado should allow it to serve digital orders more efficiently while unlocking markets where it does not have a large presence. Additionally, Kroger's stores of transaction data should allow it to optimize promotions and assortment while also selling insights to packaged goods firms.

Considering these factors and the firm's strong private-label assortment, we suspect that rather than Kroger, subscale retailers should bear the brunt of market share pressure from newcomers. We expect  $2.6\%$  revenue growth against  $2.5\%$  adjusted operating margins on average from fiscal 2019-27. With shares trading near our valuation, we suggest

investors wait before building a position in a grocer we see as uniquely able to capitalize on shifting conditions.

We are tempering our moat trend rating to negative from stable, reflecting persistent competitive pressures that should result in ongoing price headwinds and necessitate continued investment to deliver a strong omnichannel experience. Although we contend that Kroger is better positioned than its traditional grocery peers, it is not immune to the price competition that has constrained top-line growth and profitability. While we have a favorable view of management's Restock Kroger optimization initiative, we believe the need to reinvest savings behind low prices as well as the plan's reliance on new alternative revenue streams to achieve the targeted \(400 million of incremental operating income by fiscal 2020 suggests a more tempered outlook until results materialize. Still, we anticipate the plan will enable Kroger to hold adjusted operating margins fairly constant despite the challenging environment, with our forecasts calling for less than 5 basis points of deterioration between fiscal 2018 and 2027.

# After On-Track 3Q Results, Our Long-Term View of Kroger Endures 07 Dec 2018

Considering that its third-quarter earnings leave narrow-moat Kroger on track to meet our full-year targets, our \$29.50 fair value estimate should not change materially in reaction to the news. With the quarter the latest part of a fiscal year that has seen meaningful, prudent investments in repositioning Kroger for the future (including price cuts and space-optimization efforts), we still expect the firm's long-term performance will be characterized by low-single-digit revenue growth and operating margins over the next decade. We suggest investors await a more attractive entry point before building a position, as the shares trade near their fair value.

In the quarter, revenue slid  $0.3\%$  on  $1.6\%$  identical-supermarket sales growth (without fuel). Year to date,

# Analyst Notes

Kroger saw  $1.6\%$  topline growth against 14 basis points of operating margin expansion to  $2.3\%$ , relative to our earlier expectations of a  $0.5\%$  fullyear revenue decline and a 60basispoint uptick, respectively. Management reaffirmed its fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS target of  $2.00-$ 2.15, consistent with our  $\$ 2.10$  expectation.

We are encouraged that the on-track Restock Kroger initiative is delivering early returns, with an initial focus on cost controls and broadening the grocer's revenue streams. We believe such efforts are increasingly critical as the grocery industry sees upheaval, with entrants such as Amazon threatening Kroger's strong standing. With alternative retailers attempting to usurp traditional grocers through mix, convenience, cost, or store experience (or a blend of several factors), we see the firm's plans as the cost of maintaining operating margins in the low single digits rather than as representing a large profitability expansion opportunity. Still, the plan should help Kroger become more nimble while focusing resources on its more value-generative offerings.

# Sluggish 20 Profitability Doesn't Alter Our Long-Term Outlook for Kroger 13 Sep 2018

Our \$31 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Kroger should fall by the middsingle digits after we trim our near-term targets in the wake of second-quarter results. However, we still expect the firm's transformation effort will yield improved long-term profitability versus fiscal 2017's  $1.7\%$  operating margin. As we expect slow first-half profitability gains are a result of transitory and timing-related factors, our long-term forecast for low-single-digit revenue growth and operating margins over the next decade is intact. While our take on the valuation implications of Kroger's quarterly results is more conservative than the trading reaction to the news (we believe partly because we had been somewhat more pessimistic about fiscal 2018 revenue and adjusted

EPS than prevailing sentiment), we still suggest investors await a more attractive entry point.

In the quarter, revenue rose  $1.0\%$  on  $1.6\%$  identical-supermarket sales growth (without fuel). For the first half, sales increased  $2.4\%$  against 35 basis points of operating margin expansion (to  $2.4\%$ ), with top-line results ahead of our  $0.5\%$  estimated full-year decline but profitability short of our 60-basis-point targeted uptick. Management maintained its fiscal 2018 EPS target at  $2.00-$ 2.15 against our  $\$ 2.10$  expectation.

We attribute the profitability shortfall to transitory and timing-related factors. We concur with management's indications that price cuts and space optimization efforts that were pulled forward likely weighed on earnings, but we expect such initiatives to boost future results. With customers increasingly demanding an omnichannel experience including a high-quality in-store environment and numerous order-fulfillment options, we applaud management's focus on bolstering its delivery, click-and-collect, and ship-to-home offerings. Still, we believe competitive dynamics will limit Kroger's long-term operating margins to the low single digits even after the investments bear fruit.

We are intrigued by management's recent announcement that it will be making some of its Simple Truth private-label offerings available on Tmall in China. While we do not anticipate the move will have a meaningful impact for years until its presence is established, and ongoing trade policy concerns threaten to upend the nascent effort, we believe it will serve as a test of the degree to which the brand (which now accounts for  \$2 billion in annual revenue out of Kroger's roughly\$ 122 billion) can develop stand-alone equity. Assuming management is not distracted from its numerous challenges in its home market (particularly intensifying competition, the consumer's ongoing channel shift, and

# Research Methodology for Valuing Companies

# Qualitative Equity Research Overview

At the heart of our valuation system is a detailed projection of a company's future cash flows, resulting from our analysts' research. Analysts create custom industry and company assumptions to feed income statement, balance sheet, and capital investment assumptions into our globally standardized, proprietary discounted cash flow, or DCF, modeling templates. We use scenario analysis, in-depth competitive advantage analysis, and a variety of other analytical tools to augment this process. We believe this bottom-up, long-term, fundamentally based approach allows our analysts to focus on long-term business drivers, which have the greatest valuation impact, rather than short-term market noise.

Morningstar's equity research group ("we," "our") believes that a company's intrinsic worth results from the future cash flows it can generate. The Morningstar Rating for stocks identifies stocks trading at an uncertainty-adjusted discount or premium to their intrinsic worth—or fair value estimate, in Morningstar terminology. Five-star stocks sell for the biggest risk-adjusted discount to their fair values whereas 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.

Four key components drive the Morningstar rating: (1) our assessment of the firm's economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock's fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process ultimately culminates in our single-point star rating.

# 1. Economic Moat

The concept of an economic moat plays a vital role not only in our qualitative assessment of a firm's long-term investment potential, but also in the actual calculation of our fair value estimates. An economic moat is a structural feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period of time. We define excess economic profits as returns on invested capital (or ROIC) over and above our estimate of a firm's cost of capital, or weighted average cost of capital (or WACC). Without a moat, profits are more susceptible to competition. We have identified five sources of economic moats:

intangible assets, switching costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.

Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are more likely than not to achieve normalized excess returns for at least the next 10 years. Wide-moat companies are those in which we have very high confidence that excess returns will remain for 10 years, with excess returns more likely than not to remain for at least 20 years. The longer a firm generates economic profits, the higher its intrinsic value. We believe low-quality no-moat companies will see their normalized returns gravitate toward the firm's cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.

To assess the direction of the underlying competitive advantages, analysts perform ongoing assessments of the moat trend. A firm's moat trend is positive in cases where we think its sources of competitive advantage are growing stronger; stable where we don't anticipate changes to competitive advantages over the next several years; or negative when we see signs of deterioration.

All the moat and moat trend ratings undergo periodic review and any changes must be approved by the Morningstar Economic Moat Committee, comprised of senior members of Morningstar's equity research department.

# 2. Estimated Fair Value

Combining our analysts' financial forecasts with the firm's economic moat helps us assess how long returns on invested capital are likely to exceed the firm's cost of capital. Returns of firms with a wide economic moat rating are assumed to fade to the perpetuity period over a longer period of time than the returns of narrow-moat firms, and both will fade slower than no-moat firms, increasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.

Our model is divided into three distinct stages:

# Stage I: Explicit Forecast

In this stage, which can last five to 10 years, analysts make full financial statement forecasts, including items such as revenue, profit margins, tax rates, changes in working-capital accounts, and capital spending. Based on these projections, we calculate earnings before interest, after taxes, or EBI, and the net new investment, or NNI, to derive our annual free cash flow forecast.

# Stage II: Fade

The second stage of our model is the period it will take the company's return on new invested capital — the return on capital of the next dollar invested ("RONIC") — to decline (or rise) to its cost of capital. During the Stage II period, we use a formula to approximate cash flows in lieu of explicitly modeling the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement as we do in Stage I. The length of the second stage depends on the strength of the company's economic moat. We forecast this period to last anywhere from one year (for companies with no economic moat) to 10-15 years or more (for wide-moat companies). During this period, cash flows are forecast using four assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the period, a normalized investment rate, average return on new invested capital, or RONIC, and the number of years until perpetuity, when excess returns cease. The investment rate and return on new invested capital decline until the perpetuity stage is reached. In the case of firms that do not earn their cost of capital, we assume marginal ROICs rise to the firm's cost of capital (usually attributable to less reinvestment), and we may truncate the second stage.

# Stage III: Perpetuity

Once a company's marginal ROIC hits its cost of capital, we calculate a continuing value, using a standard perpetuity formula. At perpetuity, we assume that any growth or decline or investment in the business neither creates nor destroys value and that any new investment provides a return in line with estimated WACC.

Morningstar Research Methodology for Valuing Companies

Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar earned tomorrow, we discount our projections of cash flows in stages I, II, and III to arrive at a total present value of expected future cash flows. Because we are modeling free cash flow to the firm—representing cash available to provide a return to all capital providers—we discount future cash flows using the WACC, which is a weighted average of the costs of equity, debt, and preferred stock (and any other funding sources), using expected future proportionate long-term market-value weights.

# 3. Uncertainty Around That Fair Value Estimate

Morningstar's Uncertainty Rating captures a range of likely potential intrinsic values for a company and uses it to assign the margin of safety required before investing, which in turn explicitly drives our stock star rating system. The Uncertainty Rating represents the analysts' ability to bound the estimated value of the shares in a company around the fair value estimate, based on the characteristics of the business underlying the stock, including operating and financial leverage, sales sensitivity to the overall economy, product concentration, pricing power, and other company-specific factors.

Analysts consider at least two scenarios in addition to their base case: a bull case and a bear case. Assumptions are chosen such that the analyst believes there is a  $25\%$  probability that the company will perform better than the bull case, and a  $25\%$  probability that the company will perform worse than the bear case. The distance between the bull and bear cases is an important indicator of the uncertainty underlying the fair value estimate.

Our recommended margin of safety widens as our uncertainty of the estimated value of the equity increases. The more uncertain we are about the estimated value of the equity, the greater the discount we require relative to our estimate of the value of the firm before we would recommend the purchase of the shares. In addition, the uncertainty rating provides guidance in portfolio construction based on risk tolerance.

Our uncertainty ratings for our qualitative analysis are low, medium, high, very high, and extreme.

Low-margin of safety for 5-star rating is a  $20\%$  discount and for 1-star rating is  $25\%$  premium.  
Medium-margin of safety for 5-star rating is a  $30\%$  discount and for 1-star rating is  $35\%$  premium.  
High-margin of safety for 5-star rating is a  $40\%$  discount and for 1-star rating is  $55\%$  premium.  
$\triangleright$  Very High-margin of safety for 5-star rating is a  $50\%$  discount and for 1-star rating is  $75\%$  premium.  
Extreme-margin of safety for 5-star rating is a  $75\%$  discount and for 1-star rating is  $300\%$  premium.

# 4. Market Price

Morningstar Equity Research Star Rating Methodology

# Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks

Once we determine the fair value estimate of a stock, we compare it with the stock's current market price on a daily basis, and the star rating is automatically re-calculated at the market close on every day the market on which the stock is listed is open.

Please note, there is no predefined distribution of stars. That is, the percentage of stocks that earn 5 stars can fluctuate daily, so the star ratings, in the aggregate, can serve as a gauge of the broader market's valuation. When there are many 5-star stocks, the stock market as a whole is more undervalued, in our opinion, than when very few companies garner our highest rating.

We expect that if our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years (although it is impossible to predict the exact time frame in which market prices may adjust).

Our star ratings are guideposts to a broad audience and individuals must consider their own specific investment goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, time horizon, income needs, and complete investment portfolio, among other factors.

The Morningstar Star Ratings for stocks are defined below:

$\star \star \star \star \star$  We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk-adjusted return is highly likely over a multiyear time frame. The current market price represents an excessively pessimistic outlook, limiting downside risk and maximizing upside potential.  
$\star \star \star \star$  We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk-adjusted return is likely.  
$\text{★★★}$  Indicates our belief that investors are likely to receive a fair risk-adjusted return (approximately cost of equity).  
$\star \star$  We believe investors are likely to receive a less than fair risk-adjusted return.  
$\star$  Indicates a high probability of undesirable risk-adjusted returns from the current market price over a multiyear time frame, based on our analysis. The market is pricing in an excessively optimistic outlook, limiting upside potential and leaving the investor exposed to Capital loss.

# Research Methodology for Valuing Companies

# Other Definitions

Last Price: Price of the stock as of the close of the market of the last trading day before date of the report.

Stewardship Rating: Represents our assessment of management's stewardship of shareholder capital, with particular emphasis on capital allocation decisions. Analysts consider companies' investment strategy and valuation, financial leverage, dividend and share buyback policies, execution, compensation, related party transactions, and accounting practices. Corporate governance practices are only considered if they've had a demonstrated impact on shareholder value. Analysts assign one of three ratings: "Exemplary," "Standard," and "Poor." Analysts judge stewardship from an equity holder's perspective. Ratings are determined on an absolute basis. Most companies will receive a Standard rating, and this is the default rating in the absence of evidence that managers have made exceptionally strong or poor capital allocation decisions.

Quantitative Valuation: Using the below terms, intended to denote the relationship between the security's Last Price and Morningstar's quantitative fair value estimate for that security.

- Undervalued: Last Price is below Morningstar's quantitative fair value estimate.  
Fairly Valued: Last Price is in line with Morningstar's quantitative fair value estimate.  
Overvalued: Last Price is above Morningstar's quantitative fair value estimate.

# Risk Warning

Please note that investments in securities are subject to market and other risks and there is no assurance or guarantee that the intended investment objectives will be achieved. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. A security investment return and an investor's principal value will fluctuate so that, when redeemed, an investor's shares may be worth more or less than their original cost. A security's current investment performance may be lower or higher than the investment performance noted within the report. Morningstar's Uncertainty Rating serves as a useful data point with respect to sensitivity analysis of the assumptions used in our determining a fair value price.
