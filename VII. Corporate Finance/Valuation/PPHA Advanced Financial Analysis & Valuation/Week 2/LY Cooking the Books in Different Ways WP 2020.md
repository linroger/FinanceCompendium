## Abstract

Prior studies examine how fraud firms manipulate their accruals in order to overstate their earnings. We document that some fraud firms also manipulate their operating cash flows in order to fraudulently overstate earnings. More importantly, we predict that these earnings-cash flow frauds (ECF) are harder to detect and have more severe consequences when compared to earnings frauds in which operating cash flows are not misstated. Consistent with our predictions, we find that earnings-cash flow frauds take longer to detect, have larger estimated damages, elicit more negative market reactions, are more likely to result in CEO and executive turnover, and are more likely to result in securities lawsuits. We conclude that ECF frauds are harder to detect and have more severe consequences.

## 1. Introduction

The accounting literature has a long tradition of examining accrual manipulations among firms that are found to have fraudulently overstated their earnings. Consistent with the above quotations, the literature's focus on accruals reflects a widespread belief that operating cash flows are not easy to manipulate. Consider, for example, the most common type of fraudulent reporting; i.e., fictitious sales. It is generally assumed that reporting fictitious cash sales is very difficult because customers are not willing to hand over cash for sales that are fictitious. Therefore, it is usually supposed that fraud firms will record fictitious credit sales, causing earnings to be overstated through accruals rather than through operating cash flows.

One objective of this study is to challenge this conventional wisdom. We begin by documenting that a substantial number of earnings frauds involve overstatements of operating cash flows. Moreover, we document the various tricks that firms use to overstate their operating cash flows at the same time they overstate their earnings. More importantly, we predict that these earnings-cash flow frauds (hereafter 'ECF frauds') are more difficult to detect and have more severe consequences than the earnings frauds that only involve accrual manipulations. Consistent with these predictions, we find that ECF frauds take longer to detect, their estimated damages are larger, the market reactions are more negative when the frauds are discovered, they are more likely to result in CEO and executive turnover, and they are more likely to result in securities litigation.

We argue that fraud firms are motivated to overstate their operating cash flows because doing so helps to make their overstated earnings appear more credible. Investors pay close attention to whether earnings are supported by operating cash flows. Therefore, a firm whose reported earnings are not supported by operating cash flows is likely to incur a valuation discount (Graham et al. 2005; Siegel 2006). Overstatements of operating cash flows also make it more difficult for auditors, investors, and regulators to detect that earnings are overstated. For example, when a firm records fictitious sales, the overstated revenues are less likely to attract the auditor's scrutiny if the (phony) sales appear to have generated cash. Overstatements of operating cash flows also help fraud firms to avoid accrual reversals that would otherwise reduce reported earnings. For instance, when a firm reports fictitious credit sales, the accruals embedded within accounts receivable will eventually reverse once it becomes apparent that the cash is not collectible. In principle, a fraud firm could offset the accrual reversals and continue to overstate earnings by accelerating the recording of fictitious credit sales, but an obvious disadvantage with this strategy is that the accruals quickly become larger and larger, providing a red flag to financial statement users that a fraud is taking place (Dechow et al. 2012). Consequently, investors and other parties would have their suspicions lowered when a fraud firm reports high operating cash flows that match its overstated earnings.<sup>1</sup>

We argue that fraud firms overstate their operating cash flows in order to make it more difficult for auditors, investors, and other parties to detect that a fraud is taking place. We therefore predict that ECF frauds are more difficult to detect, and will therefore last longer,

compared to non-ECF frauds (H1). Moreover, we predict that the consequences are more severe for ECF frauds because such frauds are less expected and they are more likely to involve managers' sophisticated and calculated attempts to avoid detection (H2).

We use the SEC's Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAERs) to identify firms that allegedly commit fraud by overstating their earnings. We use the fraud descriptions in the AAERs (and the accompanying Litigation Releases) to identify whether the firms overstate their operating cash flows as part of their scheme to overstate earnings.[2] We use AAERs rather than other indicators of misreporting (e.g., restatements) because AAERs provide the granular information that we need to determine whether earnings are overstated through operating cash flows or through accruals alone. In addition, AAERs suit our purpose because AAERs contain allegations of intentional misreporting whereas not all restatements are intentional and our focus is on intentional misreporting (Hennes et al. 2008). Our sample comprises 455 fraud firms and 3,164 fraud firm-quarters from 1988 to 2015.[3]

Confirming the importance of ECF frauds, we find that 147 (32%) of the fraud firms overstate their earnings through manipulations of operating cash flows. This finding is important given the focus of the prior literature on accrual manipulations rather than manipulations of operating cash flows. Next, we document the various tricks that fraud firms use to overstate their operating cash flows. We find the most common method (used by 113

firms) is to misclassify the sources of cash; e.g., cash flows from financing or investing activities are misclassified as cash flows from operating activities. In another 14 cases we find that fraud firms report fictitious cash balances, while 24 firms use cash from other fraudulent sources - such as customer over-charging or related parties - to overstate their operating cash flows.<sup>4</sup> (Appendix A provides case study examples to illustrate the various tricks that firms use to overstate their operating cash flows while at the same time overstating earnings.)

Next, we test our first prediction that the ECF frauds take longer to detect than the non-ECF frauds. Consistent with H1, we find that the median fraud duration is around one third longer for ECF frauds compared to non-ECF frauds. The differences in fraud duration are statistically significant as well as large in magnitude  $(p < 0.001)$ . Not only do the ECF frauds take longer to detect, we also find that the consequences are much more severe (H2). Estimated damages are approximately twice as large for ECF frauds compared to non-ECF frauds. The adverse market reactions to fraud news are approximately  $50\%$  larger for ECF frauds compared to non-ECF frauds. The CEO turnover rate is significantly higher for ECF frauds  $(51\%$  versus  $38\%)$  and the turnover rate of other executives is also significantly higher  $(43\%$  versus  $35\%)$ . Moreover, ECF frauds are more likely to result in accounting lawsuits  $(84\%$  versus  $66\%)$  compared to non-ECF frauds. Overall, we conclude that earnings frauds take longer to detect and have more severe consequences when they involve overstatements of operating cash flows rather than just overstatements of accruals.

Our study makes several contributions to the prior literature. First, the accounting and finance literatures have long assumed that misreporting occurs through accruals rather than through operating cash flows. This is based on the common perception that cash is not easily

misstated because 'cash is king'.<sup>5</sup> This assumption is problematic, however, because it ignores the fact that operating cash flows can be misreported. Fraud firms are motivated to overstate their operating cash flows in order to reduce the risk of detection and to circumvent the problem of accrual reversals from earnings overstatements in prior periods.

Second, our study helps to explain why the prior literature finds that accruals variables are weak predictors of earnings frauds. According to prior literature, one explanation is that abnormally large accruals do not necessarily indicate that a firm is fraudulent because large accruals can instead reflect a firm's expectations of future growth and future cash flows (Sankar and Subramanyam 2001; Fairfield et al. 2003; Kothari et al. 2005; Zhang 2007; Tucker and Zarowin 2006). This literature helps to explain why fraud prediction models produce high rates of false positives; i.e., large accruals can indicate the presence of fraud where no fraud exists. However, this literature does not address the question as to why fraud prediction models also tend to produce high rates of false negatives (i.e., frauds exist even in the absence of large accruals). Our study helps to explain why many fraud firms have normal values for accruals even when their frauds are long lasting and very serious.[6]

Finally, our findings suggest significant pitfalls with relying on accruals metrics to identify possible cases of fraudulent reporting. Relying on accruals is difficult because earnings are often overstated through operating cash flows rather than accruals alone.[7] This has important implications for the SEC, which relies on accruals metrics to identify possible

cases of fraudulent accounting. It also has important implications for auditors because auditing standards recommend that auditors test earnings by operating cash flows. For example, auditors look for evidence of cash being generated from sales in order to verify that recorded sales actually occurred. Our study shows that an over-reliance on reported cash flows from operations could result in auditors failing to detect the most serious types of frauds, namely those that last longest and that have the most severe consequences.[8]

## 2. A Case Study Example, Prior Literature, and Hypotheses Development

2.1 Why are fraud firms motivated to overstate operating cash flows?

We use the case of Dynegy Inc. to illustrate why fraud firms are motivated to overstate their operating cash flows while concurrently overstating earnings. According to the SEC, Dynegy chose to overstate operating cash flows because analysts were raising questions about the widening gap between the firm's (overstated) earnings and its reported operating cash flows.

"some energy analysts following Dynegy had noticed the widening gap between Dynegy's net income and operating cash flow. Some analysts viewed this widening gap as possible evidence that Dynegy's energy contracts were overvalued, and that Dynegy's liquidity and access to capital were potentially impaired. In late 2000, Dynegy began exploring means of narrowing the gap between its net income and operating cash flow" (SEC 2002, AAER No. 1631).

Fraud firms can close the gap between earnings and operating cash flows using various accounting tricks. One common method is for the fraud firm to misclassify the sources of its cash flows. Under generally accepted accounting principles, changes in cash balances are classified into three sources: (1) cash from operating activities, (2) cash from investing

activities, or (3) cash from financing activities. It follows that one way to overstate cash from operating activities is to misclassify cash from investing or financing activities as cash from operations. In the case of Dynegy, the firm decided to misclassify cash from financing activities as cash from operations in order to reassure analysts about the quality of its (overstated) earnings. Specifically, in April 2001, Dynegy entered into a five-year contract (dubbed "Project Alpha") to purchase natural gas from an unconsolidated special purpose entity (SPE). The SPE borrowed  \$300 million to sell natural gas to Dynegy at below-market rates for 9 months. The contract stipulated that, in the following 51 months, Dynegy would purchase natural gas from the SPE at above-market rates as a way of repaying the\$ 300 million. However, instead of reporting the \$300 million as a financing cash flow, Dynegy incorrectly reported it as cash from operations. The sole purpose of the scheme was to overstate operating cash flows in order to reassure analysts by closing the gap between (overstated) earnings and operating cash flows (SEC 2002, AAER No. 1631).

Interestingly, the AAER indicates that the SEC staff found Dynegy's cash flow misreporting especially surprising because there is a general presumption that cash flows are immune from tampering.

"Alpha's impact on Dynegy's financial statements was especially significant because the Statement of Cash Flows has historically been considered immune from cosmetic tampering" (emphasis added; SEC 2002, AAER No. 1631).

We emphasize that the Dynegy case is just one example of a more pervasive phenomenon. There are other fraud firms in our sample that overstate their operating cash flows using other types of accounting trickery. For instance, while Dynegy misclassified its cash from financing activities as cash from operations, other fraud firms misclassify cash from investing activities as cash from operations. Some fraud firms use multiple methods, such as

misclassifying cash from both financing and investing activities as cash from operations. Other firms generate cash from other types of fraudulent activities (e.g., customer over-charging) to overstate their cash from operations. Others simply report fictitious increases in cash balances in order to overstate their cash from operations. Appendix A provides further examples of the various tricks employed and we discuss these case studies in more detail when we present our descriptive statistics.

We emphasize, in addition, that the timing of the cash flow overstatement can occur after or at the same time as the overstatement of earnings. Moreover, the overstatement of operating cash flows can occur in the absence of any overstatement of accruals. The details differ depending on the circumstances of the individual case. For example, in the Dynegy case, the firm first overstated its earnings using accruals and later it overstated its operating cash flows in order to close the gap between earnings and operating cash flows. In other ECF frauds, the timing can be different. Sometimes the ECF firm will report fictitious cash transactions, in which case there is no accrual manipulation because the cash misstatement occurs at the exact same time as the earnings misstatement (e.g., Collins & Aikman reported receiving cash rebates from a supplier whereas in fact the cash was from a related party). Thus, an ECF fraud can, but does not always, involve an overstatement of accruals. Offering another variant, the fraud firm will sometimes report a fictitious accrual (e.g., a fictitious credit sale) but the firm will eliminate the accrual prior to the fiscal year-end by reporting that cash was generated prior to the year-end date. Some fraud firms time their cash flow misreporting prior to the fiscal year-end as part of a clever strategy to dupe their auditors (e.g., Lernout & Hauspie).[10]

### 2.2 Accruals and Financial Misreporting

The possibility that earnings can be misstated through operating cash flows has largely been ignored in the prior literature, which has instead focused on accrual manipulations (Dechow et al. 1996; Beneish 1997; Lee et al. 1999; Jones et al. 2008; Dechow et al. 2011; Perols and Lougee 2011; Bentley et al. 2013). Despite the focus on accruals metrics, the evidence is less than over-whelming that accruals variables are strong predictors of earnings frauds. Some studies find that accruals are significantly different between fraud and no-fraud firms (Lee et al. 1999; Jones et al. 2008; Dechow et al. 2011), whereas other studies find that accruals are insignificant predictors of fraud (Perols and Lougee 2011; Bentley et al. 2013; Markelevich and Rosner 2013).

Furthermore, the evidence suggests that accruals do a particularly poor job of isolating the period in which the fraudulent reporting occurs. Dechow et al. (1996) report that accruals are not larger during the years of misreporting compared to the pre-fraud years of fraud firms. Perols and Lougee (2011) find that discretionary accruals are significantly larger during the pre-fraud period compared to the fraud period. Similarly, Dechow et al. (2011) find that some accruals metrics are larger in the pre-fraud period, whereas other accruals variables are not significantly different between the pre-fraud and fraud periods.[11]

Overall, the evidence suggests that accruals metrics are not particularly powerful indicators of fraudulent reporting. In other words, fraud prediction models tend to have a high incidence of false positives (i.e., non-fraud firms are wrongly classified as fraudulent) and false negatives (i.e., fraud firms are wrongly classified as non-fraudulent). The extant literature offers some reasons for the high incidence of false positives. Abnormally large accruals can reflect a firm's expectations about its future growth prospects and future cash flows (Sankar and Subramanyam 2001; Fairfield et al. 2003; Kothari et al. 2005; Zhang 2007; Tucker and Zarowin 2006). Thus, firms with unusually large accruals can be wrongly identified as fraudulent.[12]

Our study focuses on the opposite phenomenon; i.e., the problem of false negatives. We argue that fraud firms may give the appearance of being non-fraudulent because they take steps to make their frauds difficult to detect. Fraud firms are motivated to avoid reporting large accruals because large accruals can raise suspicions from investors, analysts, and auditors about reported earnings. As illustrated in the case of Dynegy, a fraud firm may try to close the gap between reported earnings and operating cash flows by overstating the cash generated from operating activities. Another motivation for overstating operating cash flows is that the fraud firm may want to continue overstating its earnings for a long period of time. Because accruals have a tendency to reverse when operating cash flows fail to materialize, a fraud firm that relies on accruals alone would have to report larger and larger accruals in order to show overstated earnings over a sustained period of time. These large and increasing

accruals are likely to attract unwanted scrutiny from investors, analysts, and auditors. The fraud firm can avoid this scrutiny by overstating its operating cash flows rather than relying on overstated accruals alone.

### 2.3 Hypothesis 1: Fraud Duration

Investors pay close attention to whether reported earnings are supported by operating cash flows (Graham et al. 2005). In the aftermath of the Enron scandal, investors started paying more attention to cash flow statements in order to better monitor the quality of reported earnings (Siegel 2006). Consistent with investors viewing cash flows as important, the managers of fraud firms sometimes draw the attention of investors to reported operating cash flows in order to make the reported earnings appear more credible. For example, when Tyco was engaged in a massive earnings fraud, the Chief Financial Officer (Mark Swartz) attempted to reassure analysts and investors by telling them to "forget reported earnings" and to instead focus on cash flow generation "to show that our quality of earnings is good" (Maremont 2002).[13] It turns out that the earnings were not good because Tyco was overstating both its earnings and its operating cash flows.

Similarly, regulators pay close attention to the gap between earnings and operating cash flows. The SEC has a statistical model that uses measures of accruals to identify firms that might be misreporting their earnings (Lewis 2012). Similarly, other capital market participants such as financial analysts, short-sellers, and auditors pay close attention to large

gaps between reported earnings and operating cash flows. Auditing standard AS 2401 states that recurring negative cash flows from operations in conjunction with reported earnings and earnings growth are factors indicating a high risk of fraudulent reporting.[14] Consequently, when auditors see that earnings appear to be supported by operating cash flows, they are likely to assess the risk of fraud as being low. When auditors assess fraud risk as low, auditing standards permit auditors to reduce their levels of substantive testing, which would reduce the probability of fraud detection.

Auditors often test the validity of a firm's reported earnings by looking for evidence of cash from operating activities. For example, auditing standards allow auditors to examine cash collections instead of using audit confirmations when they test for fictitious sales. Auditing standards also allow auditors to test the validity of recorded receivables by examining subsequent cash collections. There is evidence that some unscrupulous managers have exploited these known features of auditing standards to reduce the probability of fraud detection. For example, during the audit of Longtop Financial Technologies, the audit firm (Deloitte) originally planned to verify three large sales contracts by sending audit confirmations to the customers. Longtop's CFO told the auditors that auditing standards permit alternative procedures for testing sales - examination of cash receipts - as an alternative to sending confirmation requests. Faced with pressure from the CFO, the auditors agreed not to send confirmations to the customers.[15] When the fraud was eventually discovered, it was found that the cash receipts that had been used as an alternative auditing procedure were fictitious. Thus, the reported cash receipts were unreliable for drawing

inferences about the validity of the reported sales which were also fictitious (Joseph F. Faris v. Longtop Financial Technologies, 2011; SEC v. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu 2011; Re: Longtop Financial Technologies Limited Securities Litigation, 2013).

Firms have incentives to make their frauds difficult to detect for the simple reason that they wish to avoid getting caught. An earnings overstatement is easier to detect if it is accompanied by abnormally large accruals. Therefore, this is something that fraud firms will want to avoid if at all possible.[16] Abnormally large accruals can lead to unwanted questions from external auditors, financial analysts, investors, regulators, and other interested parties. For example, a firm that records fictitious sales would tend to accumulate unpaid accounts receivables on its balance sheet and this can lead to increased auditor scrutiny because it will signal to the auditor that the receivables may be fictitious. One trick the firm can use in an attempt to convince the auditor that the phony sales (and receivables) are valid is to make it appear that the sales have generated cash receipts.

In the absence of cash flow misreporting, a firm can only overstate its earnings for a sustained period of time by reporting larger and larger accruals. This naïve strategy runs the risk of attracting unwanted scrutiny. The fraud firm can mitigate this risk by overstating its operating cash flows instead of relying on overstated accruals alone. This would make the earnings overstatements harder to detect because the large operating cash flows would add credibility to the fraud firm's overstated earnings. Moreover, it would reduce the need to

create more income-increasing accruals in the current period in order to offset reversing accruals from the earnings overstatements of prior periods.

We expect difficult-to-detect frauds to last longer. For example, a fraud that has a detection risk of  $50\%$  per year would last two years on average, whereas a fraud that has a detection risk of  $25\%$  per year would last four years on average. Furthermore, we expect that earnings frauds are more difficult to detect when they are accompanied by overstated cash flows from operations. Given the lower risk of detection, we expect frauds to last longer when the earnings overstatements are accompanied by overstatements of operating cash flows. This leads to the following hypothesis (expressed in the alternative form):

H1: Earnings frauds have longer duration when they involve overstatements of operating cash flows rather than overstatements of accruals alone.

### 2.4 Hypothesis 2: Consequences

We expect the consequences of earnings frauds are more severe when they are accompanied by overstatements of operating cash flows. We form this expectation for three reasons. First, H1 predicts that earnings frauds last longer when earnings overstatements are accompanied by overstatements of operating cash flows. Frauds of longer duration are likely to be more costly to investors and managers when they are discovered because longer lasting frauds have more time to accumulate. Therefore, we expect more severe consequences for investors and managers when ECF frauds are discovered. Second, we expect that managers overstate their operating cash flows in order to make their frauds more difficult to detect. In turn, the lower risk of detection could encourage managers to become even more aggressive in their misreporting. Third, ECF frauds are likely to involve sophisticated planning and greater efforts by management to fool financial statement users and auditors, by convincing them that the overstated earnings are supported by operating cash flows. Once the ECF frauds are

discovered, the consequences are likely to be more serious because the frauds would be more surprising to investors and there would be more evidence of managerial intent to deceive (i.e., scienter). Based on these three arguments, we arrive at the following hypothesis (expressed in the alternative form):

H2: Earnings frauds have more severe consequences for investors and managers when they involve overstatements of operating cash flows.

To compare the relative severity of ECF frauds and non-ECF frauds, we examine four types of consequences for investors and managers. We examine: 1) the estimated damages incurred by investors (Donelson et al. 2012), 2) the market reactions to fraud news (Feroz et al. 1991; Dechow et al. 1996; Karpoff et al. 2008; Karpoff and Lou 2010), 3) the turnover of CEOs and other executives (Desai et al. 2006; Hennes et al. 2008; Karpoff et al. 2014; Ghannam et al. 2019), and 4) the incidence of securities litigation (Karpoff et al. 2008; Karpoff et al. 2014).

Note that, although we expect ECF frauds to have more serious consequences for managers (H2), this does not mean that managers are behaving irrationally when they engage in ECF frauds. Given that ECF frauds are more difficult to detect (as predicted in H1), a manager has to trade-off the benefit (i.e., a lower probability of detection) against the cost (i.e., more severe consequences in the event that the fraud is detected).

## 3. Sample, Research Design, and Descriptive Statistics

### 3.1 Sample

We identify our sample of accounting frauds using the SEC's Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAERs). We use AAERs because they provide the granular information that we require to determine whether earnings frauds involve cash flow misreporting. Other data sources - such as restatement announcements - do not generally

provide this granular information. We obtain the AAER sample from the database held at the University of Southern California. This database identifies accounting frauds and it excludes AAERs in which the allegations pertain to non-accounting securities violations such as insider trading.

An advantage of using AAERs to identify accounting frauds is that researchers can be confident that the SEC has identified a sample of firms that were intentionally misreporting. We use the narrative descriptions in the AAERs (and the associated Litigation Releases) to identify whether each fraud firm overstated its operating cash flows when it was overstating its earnings. Some examples and excerpts from the AAERs and Litigation Releases are shown in Appendix A.

Our sample comprises fraud quarters after July 15, 1988 because cash flow statements are not required prior to that date.[17] Following prior research, we drop firms with missing identifiers (e.g., CIKs, GVKEYs), financial firms (SIC 6000-6999) and frauds in which earnings were not overstated, as well as frauds that are related to the stock option backdating scandal.[18] This gives an initial sample of 460 AAER firms and 3,454 AAER firm-quarters. Requiring data availability for the control variables leaves us with 455 AAER firms and 3,180 firm-quarters.



### 3.2 Data Limitations

We acknowledge that the AAERs, Litigation Releases, and other data sources do not always provide all the information we would like to have about the frauds. The most important data limitation is that these sources generally do not show when the cash flow misreporting begins. Consequently, we are usually unable to determine whether the cash flow misreporting starts at the same time the firm starts to overstate earnings or at some point later in the fraud period.

In a few cases, the data sources reveal that the cash flow misreporting starts at the same time the firm starts to overstate earnings (i.e., no accrual manipulation). An example is Collins and Aikman (see Appendix A), where the firm overstated its earnings by reporting fictitious cash rebates from suppliers. The cash rebates were in fact from a related party rather than a supplier. In this case, the cash rebates boosted earnings and operating cash flows at exactly the same time, implying that the earnings overstatement did not involve any overstatement of accruals. On the other hand, there are other cases in our sample where the cash flow misreporting begins after the firm has already overstated its earnings (and accruals). For example, in some instances the firm records fictitious credit sales (and fictitious receivables) and, concerned that the fictitious receivables would attract attention from the auditor, the firm's management records fictitious cash receipts prior to the fiscal year-end in order to remove the fictitious receivables from the balance sheet as part of a plan to convince the auditor that the sales were genuine. In other cases, the cash flow misreporting begins after the overstated accruals have already been reported in the year-end financial statements. An example is the fraud at Dynegy, where the firm started recording fictitious operating cash flows only after analysts started raising questions about the widening gap between earnings and operating cash flows due to the large accruals on the firm's balance sheet.

Ideally, we would have wanted to gather detailed information about the timing of cash flow misreporting for all the frauds in our sample but, unfortunately, this information is

generally not available. This prevents us from examining some potentially interesting research questions. For example, we are unable to distinguish between fraudulent transactions that do not involve accrual manipulations (e.g., fraudulent cash sales) and those that involve accrual manipulations (e.g., fraudulent credit sales followed by fraudulent cash receipts). Given this data limitation, we instead distinguish between earnings frauds that involve overstatements of operating cash flows (i.e., ECF frauds) and earnings frauds that rely on overstatements of accruals alone (i.e., non-ECF frauds). Our sample of ECF frauds includes cases where accruals are not manipulated (e.g., fraudulent cash sales) as well as cases in which accruals and operating cash flows are both manipulated (e.g., fraudulent credit sales followed by fraudulent cash receipts). In other words, we use the AAERs and Litigation Releases to identify which frauds involve cash flow manipulations but we do not assume that ECF frauds do not also involve accrual manipulations. Indeed, cases like Dynegy illustrate that ECF frauds can involve accrual manipulations as well as cash flow manipulations. (We provide further tests on the relation between ECF frauds and accruals in Table 7.)

A second limitation of our data is that is that the AAERs only include the frauds that are detected. Our sample does not include any undetected frauds. While this is a limitation of prior AAER research in general, we believe there are a couple of reasons why it is less problematic for our study. First, unlike prior studies, we are not comparing AAER firms with no-AAER firms. Instead, our sample comprises AAER firms alone. Thus, we do not assume that there are no frauds among no-AAER firms. Second, our sample is likely to have fewer of the hard-to-detect ECF frauds because we examine only the frauds that are detected. This works against observing significant results for our tests of fraud duration (H1) because the hard-to-detect frauds are less likely to be in our sample.

A final limitation is that the AAERs and Litigation Releases often fail to disclose the full magnitude of the earnings overstatement. In fact, quantitative misstatement magnitudes

are provided in fewer than half of the frauds in our sample. Even when the misstatement magnitudes are disclosed, they often do not cover all years and quarters of the fraud period. Moreover, the information on misstatement magnitudes is often unavailable even when firms announce restatements because the restatement period is often shorter than the fraud period.[19] Consequently, we are not able to measure fraud severity using the magnitudes of the earnings overstatements.

### 3.3 Research Design

Our fraud duration regression is estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model.

$$
\mathrm {h} _ {\mathrm {i}} (\mathrm {t}) = \mathrm {h} _ {0} (\mathrm {t}) \exp \left(\alpha_ {0} + \alpha_ {1} E C F _ {-} F R A U D + \text {C O N T R O L S} + \mathrm {u}\right) \tag {1}
$$

In eq. (1), the dependent variable is the hazard rate (i.e.,  $h_i(t)$ ), which is the conditional probability that the fraud at firm  $i$  will end in quarter  $t$  given that it had not ended earlier. The baseline hazard,  $h_0(t)$ , captures the time variation in fraud termination and therefore controls for all time-varying factors. Under H1, we expect earnings frauds to last longer (i.e., a lower hazard rate) when accompanied by overstatements of operating cash flows. Therefore, we predict a negative coefficient on the ECF_FRAUD variable in eq. (1); i.e.,  $\alpha_1 < 0$ .<sup>20</sup>

Our choice of control variables is guided by prior research on the determinants of earnings frauds (e.g., Erickson et al. 2006). We control for firm size (SIZE) because large firms tend to face greater scrutiny and have more resources to prevent and detect fraud. We control for profitability, losses, leverage and the book-to-market ratio (ROA, LOSS, LEVERAGE, BTM)

because fraud firms are often financially unhealthy. We control for the number of business segments (#BUS_SEG) and geographical segments (#GEO_SEG) because frauds may be harder to detect when firms are more complex. Frauds may be detected more quickly when firms operate in strong information environments, so we control for institutional ownership (IO), analyst coverage (#ANALYST), Big 4 audit firms (BIG4) and litigation risk (LIT_RISK). Frauds may be detected more quickly when audit firms disclose material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Therefore, we control for the presence of an accelerated filer in the post-SOX period (ACCEL_FILER) and the issuance of adverse audit opinions on internal controls (ICMW). Given the prior literature's focus on accruals, we also include controls for total accruals (TOTAL_ACCRUALS) and a more comprehensive measure of accruals based on Richardson et al. (2005) (RSST_ACCRUALS), which is calculated using changes in working capital accruals, changes in non-current operating accruals, and changes in financing accruals. Detailed variable definitions are provided in Appendix B.

Next, we test H2 by examining whether the consequences of earnings frauds are more severe for ECF frauds compared to non-ECF frauds. We measure the severity of frauds using a suite of proxies from the prior literature. First, we follow Donelson et al. (2012) by constructing a measure of the estimated damages incurred by investors (Donelson et al. 2012). Second, we examine the market reactions to fraud news (Feroz et al. 1991; Dechow et al. 1996; Karpoff et al. 2008; Karpoff and Lou 2010). Third, we examine the incidence of CEO turnover and the turnover rates of other executives (Desai et al. 2006; Hennes et al. 2008; Karpoff et al. 2014; Ghannam et al. 2019). Finally, we examine the incidence of securities litigation (Karpoff et al. 2008; Karpoff et al. 2014). The four models are as follows:

$$
\operatorname {L n} (\text {D A M A G E S}) = \beta_ {0} + \beta_ {1} \text {E C F F R A U D} + \text {C O N T R O L S} + u \tag {2a}
$$

$$
C A R = \beta_ {0} + \beta_ {1} E C F _ {-} F R A U D + C O N T R O L S + u \tag {2b}
$$

$$
\operatorname {P r o b} (T U R N = 1) = \beta_ {0} + \beta_ {1} E C F _ {-} F R A U D + \text {C O N T R O L S} + u \tag {2c}
$$

$$
P r o b \left(L A W S U I T = 1\right) = F \left[ \beta_ {0} + \beta_ {1} E C F \_ F R A U D + C O N T R O L S + u \right] \tag {2d}
$$

The dependent variable in eq. (1) ( $Ln(DAMAGES)$ ) is the natural log of DAMAGES, where DAMAGES is the firm's highest market value during the fraud period minus its lowest market value during the six months following the end of the fraud period (in millions).

In eq. (2b), the market reactions to fraud (CAR) are calculated by aggregating the cumulative abnormal returns surrounding each news disclosure relating to fraud. We take this approach because, typically, a single fraud can have multiple news events associated with its revelation over time.[21] For a fraud that has  $n$  news disclosures, the aggregate market reaction (CAR) is measured as follows:

$$
C A R = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {n} C A R j
$$

where  $CARj$  is the cumulative abnormal return for news event  $j$ . We predict a negative coefficient on  $ECF\_FRAUD$  in eq. (2b) because we expect more negative market reactions for earnings frauds that are accompanied by overstatements of operating cash flows.

In eq. (2c), the dependent variable captures either the turnover of the CEO or the turnover rates of the firm's executives as a group. The CEO_TURN variable is equal to one if the CEO leaves the firm within 6 months following the initial revelation of the fraud, and zero otherwise. The %EXEC_TURN variable equals the turnover rate of executives in the top four positions (i.e., CEO, President, Chairman of Board, and CFO) within 6 months following the initial revelation of the fraud. We predict a positive coefficient on ECF_FRAUD in eq. (2c)

because we expect managerial turnover to be higher when earnings frauds are accompanied by overstatements of operating cash flows.

In eq. (2d), the dependent variable (LAWSUIT) is equal to one if the fraud is associated with a subsequent securities class action lawsuit, and zero otherwise. We predict a positive coefficient on ECF_FRAUD in eq. (2d) because we expect a higher incidence of litigation when earnings frauds are accompanied by overstatements of operating cash flows. In eqs. (2a) to (2d) we include the same controls as those in eq. (1). In addition, we control for accounting restatements in eqs. (2c) and (2d) because we expect that management turnover and securities litigation are more frequent among firms that disclose restatements.

### 3.4 ECF and Non-ECF Frauds

Panel A of Table 2 reports descriptive statistics for the 455 fraud firms. Panel A shows that the business equipment industry accounts for the largest proportion of frauds (30.1%). We find that 147 (32%) firms are ECF frauds (ECF_FRAUD = 1), whereas the remaining 308 firms are not (ECF_FRAUD = 0). In untabulated tests, we find no significant differences in industry composition between the ECF frauds (ECF_FRAUD = 1) and the non-ECF frauds (ECF_FRAUD = 0).



Panel B of Table 2 reports the mean values of accruals during each fraud quarter. Consistent with Dechow et al. (1996), we find that total accruals are typically negative during the fraud period. Moreover, total accruals do not become larger and larger, the longer that the fraud persists. Indeed, there appears to be no overall trend in total accruals over the duration of the fraud period. Next, we follow Richardson et al. (2005) by using a more comprehensive measure of accruals (RSST_ACCRUALS). As shown in Panel B, the mean values of

RSST_ACCRUALS are mostly positive, but they do not show any trend the longer that the fraud persists.

Panel C documents the different methods that fraud firms use to overstate operating cash flows. Of the 147 ECF frauds, we find that 113 firms overstate operating cash flows using cash flow misclassifications. For example, they misclassify cash inflows from financing as cash inflows from operating activities, or they misclassify cash inflows from investing as cash inflows from operating activities. Only 14 firms overstate their operating cash flows by reporting fictitious cash balances.[22] Another 24 firms use other (fraudulent) sources of cash, such as funds from related parties, falsely billing customers, improperly billing suppliers for promotional allowances, and diverting funds from customer accounts.

In Appendix A, we report detailed examples of the different methods that firms use to overstate their operating cash flows. These examples are based on quoted excerpts from the SEC's AAERs and Litigation Releases. Below is a brief summary of the cases.

- Enron overstated its operating cash flows in at least two ways. First, Enron failed to consolidate its off-balance sheet entities that were experiencing negative cash flows from operations even though they qualified for consolidation. Second, Enron misclassified cash from financing as cash from operations using round-trip transactions. In particular, Enron would arrange for a bank loan to be made to the off-balance sheet entity, which would pay the cash to Enron as part of a pre-pay agreement for a purchase of oil. Enron would then pay the cash back to the bank to settle the amount owed by the off-balance sheet entity (Mulford and Comiskey 2005).
- Xerox improperly accelerated its recognition of revenues. Facing pressure from analysts to report more cash, Xerox factored these overstated receivables to its banks but Xerox agreed to repurchase some of the receivables from the banks after the fiscal year-end. Consequently, some of the cash receipts were from financing activities (bank borrowing) rather than from operating activities.  
- Qwest Communications overstated its operating cash flows by misclassifying cash inflows from investing activities as cash inflows from operating activities. In particular, the firm reported one-off sales of capital assets as recurring operating revenues.  
- Delphi overstated its cash from operations and understated its cash from financing. In particular, the firm sold inventory to customers while simultaneously agreeing to repurchase the inventory in the next quarter at the original sales price, plus interest charges and structuring fees. Therefore, the sales were a sham. When the customers refused to pay, Delphi factored the worthless receivables to a bank and recorded the receipts as cash from operations. Delphi also received a lump-sum cash payment from an IT consulting firm which it used to reduce its reported IT operating expenses. However, Delphi secretly agreed to repay the IT firm with interest over a five-year period which meant that the cash receipt was a financing arrangement rather than cash from operations.  
- Time Warner overstated its revenues and operating cash flows by providing its own funds to customers in a series of round-trip transactions. In other words, the firm paid for its reported revenues using its own cash.  
- Comptronix overstated inventory in its interim financial statements. Concerned that its auditor would detect the inventory overstatement during the year-end audit, the firm's management decided to move the overstatement from inventory to sales by falsely recording that the inventory had been sold. To make the sale appear credible, the firm recorded fictitious cash receipts. At the same time, the firm recorded fictitious cash

payments to vendors for fictitious purchases of capital equipment. In fact, the cash receipts and payments never occurred: the firm simply deposited the check disbursements and check receipts into its own bank account. Thus, the firm overstated its cash inflows from operations and overstated its cash outflows on investing activities.

- Bally Total Fitness received upfront cash payments from customers for gym memberships and services. The firm prematurely recognized the cash receipts as revenues even though the revenues had not been earned. In addition, Bally understated its operating expenses by capitalizing them as if they were expenditures on long-lived assets. Thus, it understated its cash outflows on operating activities and overstated its cash outflows on investing activities.  
- Collins & Aikman recorded payments from a related party as increases to earnings and operating cash flows. The payments were subsequently returned to the related party via round-tripping transactions. In addition, the firm improperly recorded discounts on equipment as rebates pertaining to past purchases of current assets. As a result, the firm misclassified its cash from investing activities as cash from operations.  
- Cendant Corp (formerly CUC) engaged in a massive accounting fraud by overstating its earnings while also reporting fictitious cash receipts.  
- Escala Group fraudulently generated cash from customers by inducing them to purchase collectible postage stamps. The firm convinced customers to buy the overvalued stamps by manipulating the stamp valuations through its undisclosed related parties who controlled the appraisals of the stamp valuations.  
- Tenet Healthcare fraudulently generated cash by overcharging its customers (i.e., medical insurers).  
American Mobile Systems overstated its cash balance using a check kiting fraud.

Panel D of Table 2 reports descriptive statistics for the ECF and non-ECF samples. We find that the ECF firms are significantly larger than the non-ECF firms (t-stat. = 3.68). In addition, the ECF firms have higher leverage (t-stat. = 1.81), more geographical segments (t-stat. = 1.67), and higher institutional ownership (t-stat. = 1.72). The ECF firms are not significantly different from the non-ECF firms on the other characteristics.

## 4. Main Results

### 4.1 Results for Fraud Duration (H1)

Under H1, we expect earnings frauds to be of longer duration when they are accompanied by overstatements of operating cash flows. Univariate tests of this prediction are reported in Panel A of Table 3. The mean duration of the earnings fraud is 10.30 quarters in the ECF sample compared with 7.17 quarters in the non-ECF sample. Consistent with H1, the difference in duration is highly significant (t-stat. = 4.81). We obtain similar findings when examining the median length of fraud duration. The median fraud duration is 8.04 quarters in the ECF sample compared with 6.02 quarters in the non-ECF sample, and the difference is highly significant (z-stat. = 4.50). Consistent with H1, these findings suggest that ECF frauds persist for significantly longer than non-ECF frauds.



Panel B reports regression results for the Cox model of fraud duration. Consistent with H1, we find a significant negative coefficient on ECF_FRAUD, indicating that the hazard rate (i.e., the probability of cessation) is significantly lower for ECF frauds (z-stats. = -3.68, -3.29, -3.37). In terms of the control variables, we find the hazard rates are significantly higher (implying shorter fraud duration) for firms with smaller RSST accruals, firms with lower ROA, firms reporting losses, and firms receiving adverse internal control opinions.

### 4.2 Results for H2: Estimated Damages

Under H2, we expect estimated damages to be greater when earnings frauds are accompanied by overstatements of operating cash flows. Univariate tests of this prediction are reported in Panel A of Table 4. There, we find that the mean values of estimated damages are  \$8.7 billion for ECF frauds compared with\$ 4.1 billion for non-ECF frauds. This is consistent with our expectation that the estimated damages are greater in ECF frauds. However, these means are strongly influenced by the presence of some very large outliers and consequently the median values of the estimated damages are much smaller than the means. Nevertheless, the medians show the same pattern of difference between ECF and non-ECF frauds. The median values of estimated damages are \$551 million for ECF frauds compared with \$222 million for non-ECF frauds and this difference is highly significant (p < 0.0001).



We address the outliers and skewness in the raw values of estimated damages by taking a log transformation (Ln(DAMAGES)). Using this transformed variable, we find that the means and medians are similar for each sub-sample, which demonstrates that the outlier and skewness issues are mitigated. We continue to find that damages are significantly higher for ECF frauds than non-ECF frauds using the logged variable. The mean value of Ln(DAMAGES) is significantly greater in the ECF sample (t-stat. = 4.17) and the median value is also significantly greater in the ECF sample (z-stat. = 4.25).

The OLS regression results are reported in Panel B of Table 4. We find positive and highly significant coefficients on the ECF_FRAUD variable, indicating that estimated damages are significantly higher when earnings frauds are accompanied by overstatements of operating cash flows. This result for H2 holds even when we control for the fact that ECF

frauds tend to be of longer duration (H1). (The result for the ECF_FRAUD variable is even stronger if we do not control for DURATION.) As expected, longer duration frauds tend to have larger estimated damages. We also find that estimated damages are positively related to firm size, reported losses, analyst coverage, institutional ownership, and litigation risk. On the other hand, estimated damages are negatively related to firm leverage, ROA, and the book-to-market ratio.

### 4.3 Results for H2: Market Reactions to Fraud News Events

Table 5 reports the market reactions to the fraud news events. Univariate tests are reported in Panel A, while the regression results are shown in Panel B. Summing across all fraud news events, we find the mean (median) CAR is  $-35.32\%$ $(-33.24\%)$  for ECF frauds compared to  $-24.15\%$ $(-19.75\%)$  for non-ECF frauds. These differences are statistically significant (t-stat. = 3.71; z-stat. = 3.60) as well as economically large.

In addition, Panel A shows there are significantly more news events for the ECF frauds than the non-ECF frauds (t-stat. = 3.45; z-stat. = 2.80). The mean (median) number of news events is 5.56 (5.00) for the ECF frauds compared to 4.40 (4.00) for the non-ECF frauds. This suggests that the ECF frauds are more complex and take longer to unravel, resulting in a larger number of fraud-related news disclosures. The larger negative market reactions to ECF frauds are partly, but not fully, explained by the larger number of fraud-related news events. To demonstrate this, we isolate the very first disclosure, which we will call the triggering event, so that there is just one news event for each fraud firm. Using just these initial triggering events, we find the mean CAR is  $-18.03\%$  for the ECF frauds compared to  $-12.79\%$  for the non-ECF frauds and the difference is statistically significant (t-stat. = 2.44). Therefore, the market reactions are significantly more negative for ECF frauds even when we focus only on the very first public indication of the firm being fraudulent. The larger negative market reactions to

ECF frauds are also partly explained by the larger number of fraud news events. Summing across all news events subsequent to the initial triggering event, we find the mean CAR is  $-23.75\%$  for the ECF frauds compared to  $-15.76\%$  for the non-ECF frauds. Again, the difference is statistically significant (t-stat.  $= 2.54$ ). Overall, these findings indicate that the very first news event is more severe for the ECF frauds and the subsequent news events are also more severe for the ECF frauds although there are also more of these news events.



Panel B reports the results of OLS regressions that explain the magnitudes of the market reactions. In every model, we find that the market reactions are significantly more negative for ECF frauds compared to non-ECF frauds. This finding holds when we examine the entire market response over all the fraud news events, the market's response to just the initial trigger event, and the market's reaction to all subsequent fraud news events.

### 4.4 Results for H2: Executive Turnover

For our next test of H2, we examine the turnover of CEOs and the top four executives following the initial revelation of fraud. We expect higher turnover rates for ECF frauds because these frauds are more severe. Panel A of Table 6 shows that CEO turnover is  $51\%$  for ECF frauds compared to  $38\%$  for non-ECF frauds and the difference is statistically significant  $(t\text{-stat.} = 2.65)$ . When we consider the firm's top four executives, we find that the turnover rate is  $43\%$  for ECF frauds compared to  $35\%$  for non-ECF frauds  $(t\text{-stat.} = 2.25)$ .



Panel B of Table 6 reports the regression results for CEO turnover and the turnover rates of the top four executives. Consistent with Panel A, we find significant positive

coefficients on the ECF_FRAUD variable in the models of CEO turnover (z-stats. = 2.98, 3.02, 2.83). There is therefore a significantly higher departure rate for CEOs when earnings frauds are accompanied by cash flow misreporting. Similarly, we find significantly higher turnover rates for the top four executives (t-stats. = 2.78, 2.80, 2.49).[23]

### 4.5 Results for H2: Securities Litigation

Next, we test H2 by examining the incidence of litigation against fraud firms and their executives. As shown in Panel A of Table 7, there are subsequent lawsuits for  $83.90\%$  of ECF frauds compared to  $65.59\%$  of non-ECF frauds. The difference is statistically significant (t-stat.  $= 3.68$ ). Panel B reports the logistic regression results. We find significant positive coefficients on the ECF_FRAUD variable in the securities litigation models ( $z$ -stats.  $= 3.16$ , 3.23, 2.91). Consistent with our other tests of H2, these results suggest that ECF frauds are more serious than the non-ECF frauds.



### 4.6 Is Cash Flow Misreporting a Substitute or Complement to Accruals-Based Misreporting?

In this section, we examine whether cash flow misreporting is a substitute or a complement to accruals misreporting. If the two methods are substitutes, we would expect accruals to be significantly smaller for ECF frauds than non-ECF frauds. Indeed, there are some ECF frauds in our sample where earnings are misreported through cash flows alone and not through

accruals (e.g., Collins & Aikman).<sup>24</sup> Therefore, we might find that accruals are smaller for ECF frauds than non-ECF frauds.

On the other hand, the prediction is unclear because cash flow misreporting may be a complement rather than a substitute to accruals misreporting. Consistent with this, there are other cases in our sample where ECF fraud firms choose to manipulate both their accruals and their cash flows. For example, this happened at Suprema Specialties ("Suprema") (SEC 2004, AAER No. 1938) which overstated its earnings using round-tripping transactions. Each round-trip involved three parties: Suprema, a 'customer', and a 'supplier'. Suprema recorded phony sales of cheese to customers and sometimes recorded cash receipts from the customers. At the same time, Suprema recorded phony purchases of cheese from its suppliers, recognizing inventory and sending cash payments to the suppliers. Thus, most of the cash that Suprema paid to its suppliers came back in the form of cash receipts from phony sales. Although these cash flow misstatements were an integral part of making Suprema's sales appear credible, Suprema was also reporting very large working capital accruals. The accruals were driven by high levels of cheese inventory that Suprema had supposedly purchased from suppliers and high levels of accounts receivables from some of its (phony) sales. Thus, Suprema was manipulating both its operating cash flows and its accruals in order to overstate earnings during the fraud period.[25]

It is therefore an open question whether cash flow misreporting is generally a substitute or a complement to accruals misreporting. We investigate this by testing whether

accruals are smaller or larger within the sample of ECF frauds compared to the sample of non-ECF frauds. The results are shown in Table 8. We find the differences in total accruals between ECF and non-ECF frauds are insignificant. In contrast, RSST accruals are significantly larger for ECF frauds than non-ECF frauds, suggesting a complementarity between accruals misreporting and cash flow misreporting. However, this result is weak (t-stat. = 1.77), so we explore it further by examining two additional accruals metrics based on Dechow et al. (1995) and Hribar and Collins (2002). In particular, the DSS_ACCRUALS measure is working capital accruals calculated using the balance sheet approach, while the HC_ACCRUALS measure is current accruals calculated using the cash flow statement. We find that neither accrual variable is significantly correlated with ECF frauds. Overall, we find no evidence that accruals misreporting is a substitute for cash flow misreporting and only weak evidence that they are complementary.



### 4.7 Collusion and Related Party Transactions

When developing our argument for H2, we argued that ECF frauds involve sophisticated planning and greater efforts by management to deceive financial statement users and auditors. To test this argument more directly, we examine whether there are more instances of collusion and related party transactions in ECF frauds than non-ECF frauds. We read through the AAERs to identify whether each fraud involves collusion (either among individuals within the firm or outside it) and related party transactions. We expect ECF frauds are more likely to involve collusion and related party transactions because such frauds often require the co-operation of other parties in order to generate the apparent cash from operations. (See Appendix A for examples.)

Consistent with this argument, we find that collusion is present in  $28.67\%$  of the ECF frauds and  $13.22\%$  of the non-ECF frauds and the difference is statistically significant (z-stat.  $= 3.99$ ). Similarly, the AAERs reveal that related party transactions are used to facilitate the fraud in  $20.98\%$  of the ECF frauds and  $6.10\%$  of the non-ECF frauds. Again, the difference is statistically significant ( $z$ -stat.  $= 4.78$ ). In regressions that include all the controls from our tabulated tests, we continue to find that ECF frauds are associated with more collusion and more related party transactions ( $z$ -stats.  $= 3.71$ , 4.11). These results are consistent with ECF frauds being relatively sophisticated with greater efforts from management for concealment.

## 5. Conclusion

The existing fraud literature assumes that misreporting is primarily an accrual-based phenomenon. This assumption is somewhat naïve because a fraud firm that relies on accrual manipulations alone is likely to have a higher risk of detection. We argue that sophisticated managers attempt to reduce the risk of detection by misstating earnings through overstatements of operating cash flows. Cash flow misreporting is attractive to firms that fraudulently overstate their earnings because cash flow misstatements obviate the need for accrual reversals from prior periods and they help to ensure that reported accruals do not appear unreasonably large.

Consistent with these arguments we find that ECF frauds last significantly longer than non-ECF frauds. Further, we show that ECF frauds have more severe consequences, as reflected in larger estimated damages, larger negative market reactions to fraud news, a higher incidence of executive turnover subsequent to fraud discovery, and a higher incidence of securities litigation. These findings have important implications for regulators, investors, researchers, standard-setters, and audit firms because they suggest that the most serious types

of frauds involve overstated cash flows rather than accruals alone. Moreover, our findings help explain why it is so difficult for financial statement users and academic researchers to detect cases of fraudulent reporting before the frauds are publicly revealed.

### Examples of ECF Frauds Using Excerpts from AAERs and Litigation Releases

Enron Corp (fraud duration = 3/31/1997 - 6/30/2001)

AAER 1821 (emphasis added): "As part of the scheme to defraud, Skilling, Causey, and others transferred assets and liabilities to Special Purpose Entities ("SPEs"). Under applicable accounting rules, Enron did not need to consolidate the SPE on its balance sheet if an independent investor had made a substantive investment in the SPE (at least  $3\%$  of the SPE's equity), had control of the SPE, and had the risks and rewards of owning the SPE assets. Through the use of SPEs, Enron would, among other things, record earnings and cash flows while hiding debt…. In addition to the fraudulent Raptor hedging devices, Skilling, Causey, and others used LJM for other transactions, including purported asset sales. These generated reported earnings and cash flow and moved poorly performing assets temporarily off Enron's balance sheet…. In the fourth quarter of 1999, Enron engaged in a bogus asset sale to Merrill Lynch as part of an effort to meet budget targets. Enron "sold" Merrill Lynch an interest in electricity-generating power barges moored off the coast of Nigeria. When Enron was unable to find a true buyer for the barges by December 1999, it parked the barges with Merrill Lynch so that Enron could record \$12 million in earnings and \$28 million in cash flow needed to meet budget targets…. Enron induced Merrill Lynch to enter into the Nigerian barge transaction by making a secret oral promise to Merrill Lynch that Merrill Lynch would receive a return of its investment plus an agreed-upon profit within six months. Skilling and Causey knew that the promise was concealed from Enron's auditors and the public. Because Merrill Lynch's equity investment was not sufficiently "at risk," Enron should not have treated the transaction as a sale nor recorded earnings and cash flow from the transaction…. As part of the scheme to manipulate Enron's financial results and inflate its stock price, Causey, aided and abetted by others, caused Enron to obtain loans from certain financial institutions and report the transactions as sales of assets to generate purported cash from operating activities. These transactions were sham asset sales. Under Financial Accounting Standards 125 and 140, Enron "sold" assets to various SPEs it had established with various financial institutions ("FAS 140 transactions"). Through FAS 140 transactions, Causey and others removed those assets from Enron's balance sheet and generated income and cash flow, while at the same time retaining control over the assets. From 1998 through 2001, Enron used FAS 140 transactions to obtain disguised loans, keeping more than \$2.6 billion of debt off its balance sheet, generating more than \$1 billion in earnings and \$2 billion in operating cash flow…. Enron, aided and abetted by certain financial institutions, manipulated its financial results through a series of structured transactions, called "prepays." Enron used prepays to report loans as cash flow from operating activities, rather than financing activities in its balance sheet. By using prepays as a means to increase its operating cash flow, Enron was able to match its so-called mark-to-market earnings (paper earnings based on changes in the market value of certain assets held by Enron) with operating cash flow. Enron used this tool to convince analysts and credit rating agencies that its reported mark-to-market earnings were real, i.e., that the value of the underlying assets would ultimately be converted to cash. In addition, Enron failed to disclose that the prepays were actually debt and failed to disclose the extent to which Enron was using prepays in its balance sheet during relevant periods. As of April 30, 2001, Enron's undisclosed prepays totaled \$3.9 billion dollars."

AAER 1542 (emphasis added): "Xerox disguised its true operating performance by using undisclosed accounting maneuvers -- most of which were improper -- that accelerated the recognition of equipment revenue by over \(3 billion and increased earnings by approximately \)1.5 billion…. Throughout 1998, analysts looked to Xerox to increase its liquidity and called for a stronger year-end cash balance throughout 1999. However, due to poor performance and varying liquidity pressures, Xerox was unable to generate the cash demanded by analysts as evidence of a healthy balance sheet. In an attempt to create liquidity, Xerox Treasury, in the fourth quarter of 1999, instructed its largest operating units to explore the possibility of consummating factoring transactions with local banks…. Xerox fraudulently failed to disclose \)288 million of 1999 year-end factoring transactions that allowed the company to report a positive year-end cash balance, instead of a negative number…. In accounting for the \$288 million, Xerox failed to disclose the material impact of these transactions on its cash position and thus misled investors by appearing to generate cash from its operations…. Xerox sold or "factored" receivables at a discount. In other words, Xerox sold its future stream of cash at less than its full long-term value to realize instant cash. This dramatically improved Xerox's year-end cash position…. Xerox senior management was aware of the implications of these transactions. They were characterized internally as "expensive" and "merely window dressing." Xerox management believed that if the market learned of its cash problems that would signal "major operational/control issues." … Xerox also violated GAAP with respect to \$54 million of the \$288 million in factoring transactions. Although it recorded these proceeds as the result of sales by Xerox France and Xerox Mexico, Xerox agreed that it would reacquire the receivables after December 31, when the books were closed on 1999 and the proceeds could be reported as part of cash flow in Xerox's year-end financial report. This action violated GAAP and FAS 125 by accounting for these transactions as true sales. Xerox was aware of the buy-back provisions but failed to disclose them or to reverse the French transaction in its 2000 Annual Report."

#### Qwest Communications International (fraud duration = 6/30/1999 - 3/31/2002)

AAER 2613 and Litigation Release No. 18936 (emphasis added): "The Commission's complaint alleged, among other things, that from at least April 1, 1999 through March 31, 2002, Szeliga and others at Qwest engaged in a massive financial fraud that hid from the investing public the true source of the company's revenue and earnings growth. The complaint alleged that to meet aggressive targets for Qwest's revenue and earnings growth, Qwest fraudulently and repeatedly relied on immediate revenue recognition from one-time sales of assets known as "IRUs" and certain equipment, while falsely claiming to the investing public that the revenue was recurring. The complaint also alleged that Szeliga fraudulently and materially misrepresented Qwest's performance and growth to the investing public, failed properly to account for IRU sales transactions in Qwest's financial statements, and caused the company to report falsely approximately \$3 billion in revenue. Each of Qwest's capacity swaps with other carriers required that the parties exchange cash to demonstrate the purported value of the swapped capacity. Often the purchaser of capacity failed to submit its payment to Qwest as required prior to the end of the quarter when Qwest recognized the revenue. Under such circumstances, recognition of the revenue before the cash payment was received was improper under GAAP…. in September 2001, Qwest entered into a swap transaction with

Global Crossing in which Qwest sold  \$63.4 million of North American capacity and recognized approximately\$ 29 million in upfront revenue. Simultaneously, Qwest bought

from Global Crossing \$67.2 million in South American capacity. Qwest and Global Crossing tried to "paper over" the transaction by exchanging facsimile copies of checks until wire-transfers could be completed on October 1, 2001, after the close of the quarter."

#### Delphi Corporation (fraud duration = 3/31/2000 - 12/31/2004)

AAER = 2504 (emphasis added): "in the fourth quarter of 2000, Delphi sold approximately \$270 million of inventory to two third parties while simultaneously agreeing to repurchase the inventory in the following quarter for the original sales price, plus interest charges and structuring fees. By improperly accounting for the transactions as true sales, rather than as financing transactions, Delphi improperly recognized a material amount in cash flow from operations and materially overstated its reported EPS and net income for the fourth quarter of 2000…. In late December, it became clear to Delphi that its former parent company would not purchase the PGM inventory from Delphi before early 2001. Blahnik knew Delphi would have to pay the Bank a significant fee to achieve an equivalent financial statement result through a structured financing transaction. Nevertheless, with Dawes' and Blahnik's approval, Delphi went forward with the initiative it had discussed with its auditor, ultimately negotiating a transaction with the Bank. The transaction with the Bank had two components: a purchase agreement, pursuant to which the Bank agreed to purchase the PGM inventory from Delphi in December 2000, and a forward agreement, pursuant to which Delphi agreed to repurchase the identical metals from the Bank in January 2001, at specified prices. Neither contract states how the parties arrived at these prices. Delphi and the Bank executed the agreements on December 28, 2000. Blahnik signed on behalf of Delphi. On the same day, the Bank wired \$199,256,785.65 to Delphi. Delphi treated approximately \$193 million of this amount as a reduction in inventory and approximately \$6 million as a credit to cost of sales, resulting in an equivalent increase to income. On January 29, 2001, Delphi wired \$202,514,626.18 back to the Bank. Between December 28 and January 29, the metals remained under Delphi's control and, in fact, continued to be used by Delphi in its production process. The contrived inventory reduction enabled Delphi to report a \$54 million LIFO gain at the end of 2000…. As a result of the transactions, Delphi materially overstated its cash flow from operations by \$200 million and materially overstated its originally reported earnings per share by approximately 13 cents or 36% for the quarter and 7% for the full year…. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2001, Delphi solicited a lump sum payment from the IT Company, in return for Delphi providing new business to the IT Company and agreeing to repay the \$20 million, with interest, over a five-year period. Despite knowing that this payment should have been accounted for by Delphi as Delphi's liability to the IT Company, Delphi documented the transaction in a way that misrepresented the nature of the payment and accounted for the payment as an immediate reduction of IT expense in the fourth quarter…. Moreover, from 2003 to 2004, Delphi intentionally failed to disclose material sales of accounts receivable ("factoring"). In its earnings reports filed with the Commission on Forms 8-K in 2003 and in related presentations to investors and analysts in 2003 and 2004, Delphi used pro forma measures of liquidity and operating cash flow, known as Street Liquidity and Street Operating Cash Flow. Under these measures, consistent with rating agency practices, cash flow from factoring is supposed to be treated as borrowing proceeds rather than as cash flow from operations. By failing to disclose a material portion of its total factoring, Delphi materially overstated its Street Liquidity and Street Operating Cash Flow.

AAER 2216 (emphasis added): "The Company inflated its online advertising revenues by engaging in "round-trip" transactions with a host of companies with which it had commercial relationships. These transactions ranged in complexity and sophistication, but in substance, the Company provided its customers with funds to purchase online advertising from AOL. Simultaneously, the customer would enter into an agreement to "purchase" online advertising from AOL in an amount corresponding to the payment from the Company. AOL and AOL TW improperly recognized as online advertising revenue the amounts received pursuant to these purported advertising agreements and improperly accounted for the funds it provided to the customers…. AOL's round-trip transactions took several forms, including: (i) vendor transactions, in which AOL agreed to pay inflated prices for, or forego discounts on, goods and services it purchased in exchange for the vendors' purchases of online advertising in the same amount as the markup or foregone discount; (ii) converting settlements of legal claims into online advertising revenue; (iii) business acquisitions, in which AOL increased the purchase price in exchange for the sellers' purchase of online advertising in the same amount as the increase in the purchase price; and (iv) referral transactions, in which AOL and its counterparties falsely created and reported revenues…. By each of these means, AOL effectively funded its own online advertising revenue by giving the counterparties the means to pay for advertising that they would not otherwise have purchased. To conceal the true nature of the transactions, the Company typically structured and documented round-trip transactions as if they were two or more separate, bona fide transactions, conducted at arm's length and reflecting each party's independent business purpose."

#### Comptonix Corporation (fraud duration $= 3/31/1989 - 12/31/1991$)

AAER 543 (emphasis added): "Beginning in early 1989, the Company, acting through its three senior managers, wrongfully transferred certain costs from cost of sales into its inventory accounts. Comptronix thereby understated its cost of sales and overstated its inventory and income in the Company's interim period financial statements…. Near the end of 1989, the Company's three senior managers, to prevent Comptronix's independent auditors from discovering the scheme during the auditors' year-end audit of Comptronix's financial statements, devised a plan to camouflage the improperly transferred costs. This plan involved removing these costs from the Company's inventory accounts -- where they were more likely to be closely analyzed by the auditors -- and reinstating them in the Company's cost of sales account. Each time they did so, they recorded a corresponding fictitious sale of Comptronix goods and a related account receivable, which inflated the Company's revenues. At the same time that they made these adjustments, they also recorded fictitious purchases of equipment and related accounts payable, thereby again inflating the Company's assets. These sham transactions shifted the scheme's effect on Comptronix's income statement from understatements of the Company's cost of sales during the year to overstatements of the Company's sales at year-end. As a result, Comptronix's financial statements at year-end reflected overstated earnings due to the fictitious sales and overstated assets due to the fictitious equipment purchases…. To create the appearance that the fictitious sales and related receivables were legitimate, the three senior managers made it appear that payments from customers were being received and that payments from customers were being received and that payments to vendors were being made. To do so, Hebding and Medlin prepared checks payable to the purported vendors of the equipment. They retained the checks and deposited them unendorsed back into the Company disbursement account on which they had been drawn…. These purported cash disbursements were recorded on the Company's books as

payments against the phony accounts payable related to the fictitious equipment purchases, thereby eliminating the sham payables that had been established in connection with the sham equipment purchases. At the same time, the deposited unendorsed checks were recorded as payments from customers for the accounts receivable related to the fictitious sales. This entry eliminated the sham receivables established in connection with the fictitious sales."

#### Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp (fraud duration = 12/31/1997 - 12/31/2003)

AAER 3088 and Litigation Release 20470 (emphasis added): "Bally made materially false and misleading statements about its financial condition in SEC filings and other public statements from at least fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2003…. certain of Bally's accounting improprieties had the effect of improperly overstating Bally's income by recognizing revenue prematurely. Bally generated revenue by selling gym memberships, personal training services, and nutritional products. Bally improperly accounted for much of this revenue. For example, gym memberships generated two types of revenue for Bally: (1) initial membership fees, also called "initiation fees," and (2) monthly dues. Bally prematurely recognized revenue for initiation fees and monthly dues. Bally also failed to conform to GAAP when accounting for revenue from certain personal training services. Further, Bally sold packages that bundled together gym memberships, nutritional products, and personal training services, but failed to comply with GAAP in accounting for revenue from these packages…. other accounting improprieties by Bally improperly improved Bally's publicly reported financial performance by understating the expenses Bally incurred in operating its chain of health clubs…. It understated certain other current expenses by treating them as capital assets, which enabled Bally improperly to defer recognizing those expenses until years later and thus understate its current expenses while providing Bally with a short-term boost to its financial statements."

#### Collins & Aikman (fraud duration = 12/31/2001 - 12/31/2004)

AAER 2581 (emphasis added): "Beginning in late 2001, C&A entered into numerous improper "round-trip" transactions with Elkin B. McCallum ("McCallum"), a member of C&A's Board of Directors and a supplier to C&A. C&A treated more than \$14 million in payments received from McCallum in 2001, 2002, and 2003 as indirect increases to C&A's income, when in fact C&A surreptitiously repaid McCallum for each such payment. These round-trip transactions should have had no impact on C&A's income statement. Beginning in 2002, C&A further inflated its quarterly earnings by improperly recognizing in income numerous rebates received from suppliers in return for anticipated future business and other benefits. In 2004 C&A extended this fraudulent rebate scheme to purchases of capital equipment, improperly recording discounts on equipment as rebates for past purchases of non-capital goods or services. Some of these rebates were recognized in income prematurely, while others should never have been recognized at all. As part of each of these schemes, C&A induced suppliers, including McCallum, to provide false or misleading documentation regarding the payments they made or promised to C&A. C&A then used these false documents to justify accounting for these payments contrary to generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

AAER 1272 (emphasis added): "This proceeding involves a massive fraudulent financial reporting scheme that caused dramatic investor losses. For more than twelve years, until its exposure in 1998, certain members of CUC's senior and middle management devised and operated a systemic, systematic scheme to inflate operating income at CUC. The scheme was driven by senior management's determination that CUC would always meet the earnings expectations of Wall Street analysts and fueled by disregard for any obligation that the earnings reported needed to be "real." CUC senior management overseeing the scheme maintained an annual schedule listing revenue and operating income for each of the company's divisions for its current fiscal year and coming fiscal year and setting forth the so-called "opportunities" or means available for inflating the company's operating income during the coming year. At the beginning of each fiscal year, management decided which of these opportunities to use for that fiscal year and the amount needed from each such opportunity. Accordingly, the schedule served as management's "cheat sheet" for any given year…. the CUC managers implementing the scheme would make cosmetic alterations to certain balance sheet items, most notably directing that cash be adjusted upward to whatever level the managers believed was desirable. Once all the quarterly adjustments had been made, the managers would sometimes tweak the numbers slightly a second time, making small additional adjustments. These additional adjustments, for example, might be made if a comparison with the previous quarter or with the same quarter from the previous year revealed that a particular line item would stand out as a result of the contemplated adjustments…. In the late 1980s, senior management at CUC encountered a sudden, unexpected spike in membership chargebacks from one financial institution. Faced with this exigency, CUC management refused to take the required, one-time charge to the membership cancellation reserve, instead electing to hold the chargebacks off-books for one month and smooth out the impact to the reserve. That decision served as precedent, and the off-books lag was increased in future reporting periods when management was looking for additional opportunities to inflate income and further its scheme. Eventually, CUC developed a policy of keeping rejects and cancellations off the Comp-U-Card general ledger during the last three months of each fiscal year. Instead, those rejects and cancellations appeared only on cash account bank reconciliations compiled by the Comp-U-Card accounting personnel in Trumbull, Connecticut. Because the rejects and cancellations for the final three months were not recorded against the membership cancellation reserve, the policy allowed CUC to hide the fact that the reserve was dramatically understated at each fiscal year-end. Failing to book cancellations and rejects at each fiscal year-end had the added effect of overstating the company's cash position on its year-end balance sheet. In fact, Cendant's Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1998, stated that the company had discovered that its balance sheet as of December 31, 1997, had "an approximate \$100 million overstatement in cash." This reported overstatement equaled approximately two-thirds of the \$149.5 million in "cash and cash equivalents" set forth on the company's balance sheet as of December 31, 1997."

#### Escala Group, Inc. (fraud duration = 9/30/2003 - 6/30/2005)

AAER 3031 (emphasis added): "This is a disclosure and accounting fraud case that concerns fraudulent related party transactions between Escala, then a Nasdaq-listed company in the collectibles market, and its parent company, Afinsa Bienes Tangibles, S.A. ("Afinsa"), a privately held Spanish company that sold investments in portfolios of stamps in Europe, in connection with sales that became part of what Spanish criminal authorities have called a

ponzi or pyramid scheme. In a fraudulent business scheme based upon the secret and dramatic manipulation of collectible stamp values, Escala and its former CEO, Manning, violated the antifraud and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act by: (1) failing to disclose the related party status of Barrett & Worthen, Inc., resulting in control of the Brookman Catalogue and failing to disclose the revenues obtained by virtue of Afinsa and Manning's control of the prices in the Brookman Catalogue; (2) falsely representing that Escala sold Afinsa several large stamp archives at prices determined by reference to independent stamp catalogues and appraisals when in fact Manning set the catalogue prices and influenced and edited the appraisals; (3) selling back to Afinsa in a round-trip transaction inventory acquired from Afinsa in direct contravention of Escala's public promise not to do so; and (4) falsely reporting a payment for business combination-related expenses as the "sale" of certain antiques."

#### Tenet Healthcare Corporation (fraud duration = 8/31/1989 - 2/29/1992)

AAER 573 (emphasis added): "At some NME psychiatric facilities, inflated billings were rendered to insurers for therapy sessions based upon brief contact with therapists or physicians during daily hospital rounds. Hospital employees referred to this practice as "Howdy Rounds" or "Wave Therapy." In other instances, billing for therapy was based upon the assumption that all patients attended all group or individual therapy sessions scheduled for the treatment program they were in during their hospital stay without confirmation that the patient actually attended any sessions. Hospital employees referred to this practice as "Bundle Billing." … The practices in which NME's psychiatric and substance abuse treatment facilities engaged included delaying patient discharges, without medical justification, in order to permit NME to make use of all-of the patient's available insurance coverage; making medically unnecessary hospital admissions; falsifying patient medical charts to create the appearance of diagnoses that would maximize insurance coverage; making improper payments for referrals; waiving patient copayment obligations; and falsifying patient medical charts to justify billing for services such as therapies, physician consultations and medications that were not provided…. NME falsely described its SHG business as resulting from legitimate business activities and as profitable and growing. In addition, NME subsequently failed to disclose that its revenues and profits were subject to a material loss contingency arising from those same practices…. Contrary to the requirements of government insurers, certain NME psychiatric and other hospitals had a practice of making payments or conferring other benefits on physicians, therapists, counselors, consulting services or treatment centers based on the in-patient referrals that physician, therapist, counselor, consulting service or treatment centers made to NME hospitals."

#### American Mobile Systems, Inc. (fraud duration = 9/30/1988 - 12/31/1991)

AAER 683 (emphasis added): "the CEO caused deposits and disbursements to be made between the bank account of AMS and the bank accounts of his Affiliates. During this period, AMS's position changed from a borrower to a lender on a frequent basis…. the CEO often provided for AMS's short term cash needs by overdrafting the accounts of Affiliates, and similarly overdrafted AMS's bank accounts to provide cash to Affiliates. The overdrafting took place in accounts maintained at two banks…. In March 1991 the banks determined that, in their view, the CEO had been misusing the overdraft privileges to "kite" funds among the various accounts. The two banks promptly terminated the overdrafting arrangements. By that point, the CEO's banking activity had resulted in overdrafts totaling \$ 8.8 million in the

Affiliate's accounts and  \$1.2 million in AMS's account. In early April 1991, AMS entered into a\$ 12 million revolving credit agreement with another financial institution. Thereafter, AMS's CEO began using the credit facility to make cash advances to his Affiliates from AMS. By June 30, 1991, AMS had receivables due from the Affiliates totaling \$1,117,000. AMS stated in its 1991 Form 10-K that it anticipated payment of the receivable by December 31, 1991. The CEO did not make repayment, however, and continued to cause AMS to advance cash to the Affiliates. AMS accordingly remained a net lender. During January 1992, the CEO caused AMS to advance more than \$4 million to his Affiliates. The CEO was able to make these advances because he had unrestricted access to AMS's assets. The transfers originated from AMS's general bank account, which included proceeds from two private placements that AMS had conducted in November and December 1991. In March 1992, the AMS Board of Directors discovered that the CEO had transferred more than \$4 million to the Affiliates and that the amounts had not been repaid."

### Note:

Our initial sample screening process requires all firms to have GVKEY, CIK, and PERMNO available from the Compustat, CRSP, and IBES databases. We delete financial firms (SIC: 6000-6999), frauds that did not impact earnings or understate earnings, and frauds related to option backdating.

### Panel B: Fraud Duration Regression

The fraud duration regression is estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model.

$$
\mathrm {h} _ {\mathrm {i}} (\mathrm {t}) = \mathrm {h} _ {0} (\mathrm {t}) \exp \left(\alpha_ {0} + \alpha_ {1} E C F \_ F R A U D + \text {C O N T R O L S} + u\right) \tag {1}
$$

The dependent variable  $(\mathrm{h_i(t)})$  is the hazard rate; i.e., the conditional probability that the fraud at firm  $i$  will end in quarter  $t$  given that it had not ended earlier. The baseline hazard,  $\mathrm{h_0(t)}$ , captures the variation in fraud duration over time. Under H1, fraud duration is expected to be longer (i.e., the hazard rate is lower) when the firm commits an ECF fraud; i.e.,  $\alpha_{1} < 0$ .
