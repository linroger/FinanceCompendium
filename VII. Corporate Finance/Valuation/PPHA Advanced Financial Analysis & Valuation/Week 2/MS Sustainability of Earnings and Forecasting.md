# Nothing Lasts Forever: Examining Economic Earnings Quality

In times of macro turbulence extrapolating recent performance can lead to material forecast errors. Economic earnings quality (EEQ) analysis provides a sanity check for forecasts by gauging the sustainability of a firm's operating performance. We show how consensus estimates tend to overlook the effects of EEQ, and present a framework for identifying 'vulnerable' economic earnings quality.

What is economic earnings quality and why does it matter? EEQ hinges on the principle that, while the current performance of a firm can deviate from the long-run average of its peer group, the forces of competition will typically drive its outperformance back to 'normal'. This mean-reversion affects a firm's sales growth and profitability, so that overlooking the 'pull' of mean-reversion can lead to extrapolation-based forecasting errors.

Our analysis and key findings: Using a large universe of non-financial constituents from the MSCI ACWI with data back to 1995, we analyse mean-reversion patterns and their implications at the GICS industry-level for sales growth, ROA, asset turnover and operating margin. We find that: 1) sales growth shows strong mean-reversion across all industries; 2) profitability mean-reversion varies across industries, with higher mean-reversion where operating margin is a more important earnings driver than asset turnover; 3) consensus EPS forecasts tend to be less accurate for industries with a high degree of ROA mean-reversion; 4) Energy and Materials show the strongest mean-reversion for sales growth and ROA.

Applying EEQ analysis in practice: EEQ analysis can be run at the firm and industry level. To illustrate the tool, we identify extreme performers by industry, predicting the largest changes in sales growth and ROA next year in Energy, Materials and Information Technology.

# Extreme sales growth is hard to maintain

Over a five-year period, the gap between the highest and lowest quintile firms narrows from  $50\%$  to just  $6\%$

# Executive Summary

# What is this report about?

Earnings quality is a broad term with an economic dimension (Are these margins sustainable?) and a financial reporting dimension (Do these receivables adequately reflect risk?). Both dimensions are related to sustainability, and sustainability is a key input in valuation. Keeping risk constant, the higher a company's sustainable earnings growth is believed to be, the higher its warranted multiple.

In our report Earnings Quality in Emerging Markets, we focused on the accounting dimension to analyse earnings quality in prominent emerging markets. In this report, we show how a knowledge of economic earnings quality (EEQ) can be used to assess the accuracy of forecasts for sales, operating performance and earnings.

# What do we mean by Economic Earnings Quality?

We all know that a very good or very bad thing tends not to last. The economic dimension of earnings quality (EEQ) hinges on the principle that, although the current performance of a firm can deviate from the long-run average of its peer group – such that it can be delivering above-average sales growth or returns – the forces of competition will typically drive its outperformance back to 'normal', i.e., a performance commensurate with the risk of its undertakings.

To the extent that market forces are at work in any given industry, this 'force' of mean-reversion will affect the time-series pattern of most performance drivers. Economic earnings quality therefore depends on the degree of mean-reversion of underlying performance drivers, in particular growth and profitability. A firm with high EEQ derives its earnings from drivers that are less vulnerable to the pull of mean-reversion.

# How can we measure EEQ?

Based on a large universe of non-financial firms from the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI) for which we have data back to 1995, we have analysed the mean-reverting behaviour of four operating metrics that are central to valuation: sales growth, ROA, operating margin and asset turnover. The best way to show this is in 'fade diagrams' (Exhibit 2). The pattern in Exhibit 2 is striking, and shows that extreme sales growth is extremely hard to sustain, i.e. it is strongly mean-reverting. The 'fade diagram' maps the changing distribution of sales growth in the cross-section (into quintiles) and over time.

# Why EEQ matters - a focus on EPS forecasts

Necessarily, analysts focus on firm-specific characteristics when building their forecasts. But ignoring the potential impact of mean-reversion within an industry could affect the quality or reasonableness of their forecasts. Exhibit 5 shows that there is an inverse relationship between the quality of FY1 EPS forecasts (their degree of accuracy) and the extent of ROA mean-reversion across industries. In other words, it suggests that EPS consensus forecasts tend to be least accurate in industries with the strongest ROA mean-reversion. In general, therefore, EEQ appears to affect the accuracy of market forecasts.

# Why EEQ matters – Mind the 'forecast gap'

Drilling down to the level of operational metrics, we can further identify instances where statistical mean-reversion or EEQ forecasts and consensus estimates disagree most. We dub the absolute difference between both forecasts the 'forecast gap' and find that this gap points to consensus accuracy challenges. $^{1}$  Notably, we find that at the industry level the forecast gap between EEQ and consensus forecasts (measured as the median values at the industry level) maps strongly onto industry-level consensus forecast errors. $^{2}$  Based on median values for both forecast gap and error over the period 2000-2010, Exhibit 6 shows how EEQ forecasts based on a statistical analysis of recent data patterns can provide a tool to evaluate and challenge analyst forecasts. $^{3}$

We would stress though that, on average, EEQ forecasts do not and should not 'beat' consensus forecasts in terms of

accuracy. Naturally, analysts can incorporate new and timely information in their forecasts that is not reflected in the historical patterns of sales and ROA that drive EEQ forecasts.

# Beware of extrapolation

Finally, to put things into perspective, the degree of mean-reversion for a certain metric is just one of the factors that make forecasting such a difficult task. But, knowing both how extreme a firm's current operating performance is and how strongly operating performance mean-reverts in that firm's economic setting prove to be key inputs in the forecasting process.

We illustrate the practical use of mean-reversion based estimates of sales growth and ROA for the current constituents of the MSCI ACWI by industry. Specifically, we

single out those industry quintiles that are most vulnerable to mean-reversion changes (Exhibit 7), and find that most are part of the industry groups that rank highest on ROA and sales growth mean-reversion (Exhibit 4) – Energy, Materials, Semis.

EEQ analysis can be a useful benchmark to evaluate forecasts. While these mean-reversion forecasts should not be taken at face value – given they are based exclusively on

the latest value and historical patterns for each metric – they serve as a useful benchmark to evaluate forecasts that do incorporate current news and additional information.

Forecasts that resist the pull of mean-reversion require support from clear arguments as to why things will be different this time around. Mean-reversion forecasts also serve as a reminder that operational metrics in certain industries are inherently more difficult to forecast than in others.

# Too Good to Last? How EEQ Affects Performance

Sales growth mean reverts most sharply and across most industries  
86% of the gap in sales growth between the median top and bottom quintile firms will disappear over a five-year period  

- This strong mean-reversion suggests it is wise to take a close look at where a firm is within the peer group before extrapolating recent sales growth patterns

We show how mean-reversion affects financial performance metrics by zooming in on the time-series behaviour of four key operating metrics that are central to any forecasting exercise:

1. sales growth;  
2. return-on-assets (ROA);  
3. operating margins (OPM); and  
4. asset turnover (ATO).

For this analysis, we constructed a sample of all historical constituents of the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI) (ex-financials) over the period 1995-2010 for which the data is available. This created a universe of 2108 firms for which we have an average (median) 13 (15) years of data.

# Extreme sales growth is hard to sustain

Our analysis shows that both sales growth and operating margin feel the strong 'pull' of mean-reversion. The best way to show this visually is with 'fade-diagrams'. Fade diagrams map the changing distribution of, say sales growth, for a given industry group, in the cross-section (by quintile) and over time<sup>4</sup>. Exhibit 8 and Exhibit 9 show the fade diagrams for sales growth and return-on-assets (ROA). The pattern for sales growth is striking. In the base year, the median sales growth in the top quintile is  $43\%$  and  $-7\%$  in the bottom quintile, a gap of about  $50\%$ . Five years later the corresponding numbers for the same portfolio of firms are  $12\%$  and  $5\%$ , a gap of just  $7\%$ .

The numbers for ROA are less extreme but still point to material mean-reversion. In the base year, median ROA in the top and bottom quintile are  $19\%$  and  $1\%$  (a gap of  $18\%$ ). Five years later the corresponding numbers are  $14\%$  and  $4\%$ , a gap of  $10\%$ .

# Why people underestimate mean reversion

Sir Francis Galton introduced the concept of 'regression to the mean' in his genetics work when he observed that extreme characteristics in parents are not passed on completely to offspring. For example, the children of parents that are taller than the average in the population will typically be closer to the average in height than their parents.[5]

Noble-prize winner Daniel Kahneman and his long-term collaborator Amos Tversky wrote seminal academic work that documents how people tend to underestimate the effects of mean-reversion when forecasting.<sup>6</sup> Specifically, the representativeness heuristic is an important reason why people underestimate mean-reversion: people tend to believe that small samples are representative of the world at large ('the law of small numbers'). In a forecasting context, this implies that people will view recent observations as representative of the future. In addition, the availability heuristic – people tend to overweight information that is easily accessible and salient – will amplify this cognitive bias: recent data is more easily available than data from the past.

In other words, the gap between the top and bottom quintile shrinks from  $50\%$  to  $7\%$  for sales growth and from  $18\%$  to  $10\%$  for ROA – illustrating the strength of mean-reversion for both.

Taking the analysis a step further, the two components of ROA – Operating Margin (OPM) and Asset Turnover (ATO) – show different mean-reverting behaviour.

For OPM, the top and bottom quintile move from  $24\%$  and  $0\%$  to  $18\%$  and  $4\%$ , meaning the gap between them shrinks from  $24\%$  to  $13\%$ . ATO appears less subject to the pull of mean-reversion. The top and bottom quintile move from 1.5 and 0.4 to 1.4 and 0.5 (i.e., the gap is 1.1 in the base year and 0.9 five years later).

## These statistical patterns make intuitive sense

The strong mean-reversion in sales growth suggests that the economic conditions in which firms operate quickly erode any sales growth outperformance. This is not entirely surprising - extreme sales growth outperformance typically draws fierce responses from competitors. Take, for example, the strong competitive reaction (typically with a lag) to very successful products, such as the iPad. Conversely, if the firm is materially underperforming (severe downward shocks to sales), it will need to drastically reinvent itself if it wants to stay in business. Clearly, the mean-reversion of sales growth will depend on the barriers to entry (technology, patents, etc.) but the statistical evidence strongly suggests that extreme sales growth outperformance is hard to sustain.

This difference in mean-reversion between OPM and ATO is also intuitive. The stronger mean-reversion shown by OPMs is consistent with margin gains tending to be less defensible than efficiency gains and more subject to erosion. OPM is mostly a function of input and output prices, cost management, and economic bargaining power with clients and/or suppliers.

Clearly, all changes in sales that are not mirrored in changes in operating costs (or vice versa) have an immediate effect on OPMs. For example, it is relatively straightforward to imagine scenarios where OPMs rise or fall quickly as a result of energy prices.

The fact that asset turnover shows the weakest mean-reversion suggests asset efficiency gains (ATO improvement) are harder to achieve and therefore 'easier' to maintain and defend against competitive forces. The relative 'defensibility' of ATO follows from the fact that ATO relates to the investment decisions of a firm and its quality of asset management. Obtaining an advantage in asset efficiency typically involves substantive business decisions that go beyond the effects of volatility in input and output prices – for example, establishing JIT inventory systems or introducing new technologies.

Clearly, how a firm generates its ROA (its production function) will affect how it can defend its profitability against the forces of competition. We explore how the relative importance of OPM and ATO affect ROA in Appendix B.<sup>7</sup>

# The role of the long-term average in valuation

All fundamental valuation methods (DCFs, Residual Income Models, etc.) rely on some methodology to truncate forecast horizons and choose terminal value-calculation inputs. Given the importance of terminal values in these models, analysts and the users of these models need to understand the process by which operational metrics converge to their long-term average values. Do the operational metrics indeed converge? If so, what long-term average do they converge to? What is the speed of convergence? Appreciating that not all operational metrics behave in the same way or that these metrics behave differently across a variety of industry settings is a key starting point to ensure that long-term valuation models produce quality outputs.

# Capturing mean-reversion in a single figure

Exhibit 12 summarizes the patterns in Exhibits 9-12 as a single number that captures the extent to which the 'gap' between the top and bottom quintile lines in the fade diagrams shrinks over the five-year period. On this measure, the mean-reversion for sales growth is  $86\%$ , meaning that  $86\%$  of the gap between the medians of the top and bottom quintiles of current sales growth has disappeared by FY5. Mean-reversion for ROA, OPM and ATO are  $46\%$ ,  $43\%$  and  $25\%$ .

Another way to show economic earnings quality, or mean-reversion, is to plot the 'correspondence' of, say sales growth, in the base year and subsequent years across the entire sample. Using (Spearman) correlations yields a similar pattern of results to that above, namely: 1) strong mean reversion for sales growth (i.e., sharply declining correlations); 2) similar pattern of mean-reversion for ROA and OPM; and 3) weakest mean-reversion for ATO.

## Zooming in on Industry Groups

Sales growth mean-reverts strongly in any industry; ROA mean-reversion varies more widely.  

- Energy and Materials show the strongest mean-reversion in sales and ROA combined. Merely extrapolating recent performance in these industries is likely to introduce forecast errors.

EEQ or mean-reversion patterns are generally a function of the economic conditions in which a firm operates (the level of competition, business model, asset intensity, etc.), so they are naturally more pronounced in some industries than others.

In this section we examine the extent to which mean-version varies between industries for different operating metrics, and which industries show the strongest mean-reversion patterns. For reasons of parsimony, we carry out this analysis at the GICS Industry group (see Exhibit 4 or 18 for an overview of the different GICS industry groups and the abbreviations used).

# Sales growth - extreme outperformance is difficult to maintain in any industry

Exhibit 14 – which ranks GICS industry groups by the five-year mean-reversion in sales growth (a lower value indicating a lower rate of mean-reversion) – suggests that sales growth strongly mean-reverts in all industry groups. Retail shows the lowest mean-reversion, but the gap between high and low sales growth still shrinks by about  $67\%$  in five years. Energy shows the highest mean-reversion, at  $95\%$  over five years. The median rate of mean-reversion of  $82\%$  across all industry groups suggests that extreme sales growth is difficult to maintain in any industry.

# ROA – mean-reversion varies across industries, with HHPP lowest and Materials highest

In contrast, the rates of mean-reversion for ROA are lower and show greater variance across industry groups (Exhibit 15). The rate of ROA mean-reversion is just  $16\%$  for Household & Personal Products (HHPP) but as high as  $60\%$  for Materials (MATE). The median rate of mean-reversion is  $46\%$  across all industry groups.

# Operating margin and asset turnover - wide variations in mean-reversion across industries

OPM mean-reversion ranges from  $17\%$  for Household & Personal Products (HHPP) to  $62\%$  for Automobiles (Auto), with a median rate of  $38\%$ .

ATO mean-reversion, not surprisingly, shows a different ranking of industry groups, ranging from  $0\%$  in Energy (ENER) to  $43\%$  in Telecommunication Services (TELE). The median rate is lowest of all four metrics, at  $20\%$ .

The pattern of mean-reversion for ROA more closely mirrors that for OPM than for ATO: the correlation between ROA and OPM mean-reversion across industry groups is 0.78, while the corresponding number for ROA and ATO mean-reversion is 0.48.

This suggests that mean-reversion in operating margin affects the sustainability of ROA more than mean-reversion of asset turnover across industry groups.

# Ranking industries by sales growth and ROA mean-reversion - Energy and Materials highest, Retailing lowest

Ranking industry groups by mean-reversion for sales growth and ROA shows Energy and Materials have the strongest mean-reversion overall, while Retail have the weakest. Although the data are summarized at an aggregate level, the pattern holds important takeaways for forecasting in these industry groups. Clearly, 'extreme' performance in Energy and Materials appears more difficult to maintain and suggests that merely extrapolating recent performance is likely introduce errors into forecasts.

# Moving to the EPS Level – How EEQ Affects the Accuracy of Forecasts

- Mean-reversion patterns appear to be under-appreciated in consensus EPS forecasts  
- The accuracy of EPS forecasts is inversely correlated to the degree of mean-reversion in ROA, OPM, ATO and sales growth across industries

Analysts naturally focus on company-specific drivers when forecasting near-term metrics. However, recognising the 'pull' of mean-reverting competitive forces can help put forecasts into perspective and potentially improve their accuracy.

# Mean-reversion patterns are under-appreciated

Our analysis suggests that the quality, or accuracy, of analyst EPS forecasts is affected by an apparent under-appreciation of mean-reversion patterns in operating metrics. We measure the quality of EPS forecasts by looking at the (Spearman) correlation between FY1 and FY2 median consensus EPS forecasts (scaled by price as of the date of forecasts) and actual results.<sup>9</sup> A higher correlation implies more accurate forecasts. Exhibit 19 shows that correlations fluctuate over time and that the sharp downturn in 2008-09 clearly caused a dip in the quality of forecasts. The correlation line for FY2 forecasts is below that for FY1, given the challenges of a longer forecast horizon.

Using industry level correlations, Exhibits 20 and 21 show that the accuracy of EPS forecasts tends to be lower where ROA mean-reversion is stronger. We measure the degree of ROA mean-reversion as 1 minus the Spearman correlation between current ROA and three-year forward ROA. $^{10}$  Both exhibits show a negative slope for the correlation between forecast quality and mean-reversion; in other words, high forecast quality corresponds with low mean-reversion.

Repeating this analysis for the other operating metrics shows that the connection between EPS forecast quality and EEQ metrics is particularly strong for ROA and OPM, but not for ATO and sales growth. This is not entirely surprising, as EPS is likely to be more closely connected to profitability (ROA) and the income statement metric OPM (which is a function of both revenues and expenses) than to asset turnover and sales growth. As we have seen, ATO exhibits weaker mean-reversion than OPM, so the effects of ATO mean-reversion will have a lesser impact on EPS. Also, sales growth considers only the revenue aspects of the income statement and does not consider expenses.

EPS and EEQ – the accuracy of EPS forecasts is strongly correlated to the degree of mean-reversion in ROA and OPM, but not ATO and sales growth across industries

# EEQ Analysis in Practice: 'Kicking the Tyres' on Consensus Forecasts

- Investors and capital market participants typically rely heavily on (consensus) forecasts of financial statement metrics to make their decisions.  
- Armed with a knowledge of EEQ patterns across and within industries, we can review consensus forecasts using 'statistical' mean-reversion forecasts.  
- Whether at the industry or firm level, this analysis can identify where EEQ forecasts and consensus disagree most – and therefore where forecasts warrant most scrutiny or indeed where there is scope for debate.  
We would stress that, on average, EEQ forecasts do not and should not 'beat' consensus forecasts in terms of accuracy.

# Building EEQ forecasts

We construct EEQ forecasts by estimating recursive regressions in each industry quintile using information over rolling five-year periods. For example, to build EEQ forecasts of sales growth in 2011, we use sales data from 2006-2010. We then estimate recursive regressions of sales growth in each quintile of the annual sales growth distributions. Using the intercept and the slope of these regressions, we can construct an out-of-sample forecast of sales growth and sales for 2011.

# Some key points in our methodology

- We estimate the regressions per quintile/industry to account for the different speed of mean-reversion across quintiles in each annual distribution.  
- We use recursive five-year regressions to account for the fluctuations in the general level of sales growth and ROA across our study period. The estimated intercept serves as a proxy for the 'level' of sales growth or ROA over the period, while the estimated slope captures the speed of mean-reversion.  
- For our analysis, we only retain estimates from regressions based on 15 observations or more.

# Benchmarking against consensus forecasts

Next, we compute the deviation at the firm-level between the EEQ forecasts and the consensus forecasts to identify where the largest differences lie. To be precise, in the case of sales growth, we measure the absolute nominal difference between both FY1 estimates.

To replicate this analysis for ROA, we use forecasts of FY1 EBIT, a widely available metric, to derive EEQ forecasts of future ROA. Since analysts provide FY1 forecasts of total assets relatively infrequently, we alter the definition of ROA slightly here by scaling FY1 EBIT forecasts by average assets. As with sales growth, we measure the forecast deviations as the absolute nominal difference between both estimates of ROA.

# The results

This exercise can be carried out at the firm level or the industry level. We summarise our findings for the deviations between EEQ and consensus forecasts at the industry level in Exhibit 23. We dub the deviation between EEQ and consensus metrics the absolute forecast gap and show its median value by industry over the period 2000-2010.<sup>11</sup>

We make the following observations:

- The median absolute forecast gap is  $9.4\%$  for sales growth and  $2.3\%$  for ROA. This difference follows both from the scale difference of the metrics but also from the differing mean-reversion discussed throughout this note.  
- Of the 13 industries in the top quartile by absolute forecast gap, eight appear in strong mean-reversion industries for sales growth and six in strong mean-reversion industries for ROA.[12]

Eight industries appear on the list for largest absolute forecast gap for both metrics. Perhaps not surprisingly, four of these are in the Information Technology sector, an area that tends to be highly competitive. The other four are in the Energy, Materials, Industrials, and Health Care sectors.

# On average, EEQ forecasts will not, and should not, 'beat' consensus forecasts in terms of accuracy …

Naturally, analysts can incorporate new and timely information in their forecasts that is not reflected in the historical patterns of sales and ROA that drive EEQ forecasts. Our analysis uses consensus forecasts of FY1 metrics one month after the announcement of the latest annual financial statements. This allows time for forecasts to be adjusted to reflect the latest financials and any other information released with the results.

# … but the gap between EEQ and consensus forecasts points to consensus accuracy challenges

Notably, we find that at the industry level the gap between EEQ and consensus forecasts (measured as the median values at the industry level) maps very strongly onto industry-level consensus forecast errors (Exhibit 26 and 27).

In other words, EEQ forecasts, based on a statistical analysis of recent data patterns can provide a means to evaluate and challenge analyst forecasts.

# A bit more on the context of the analysis

The patterns documented throughout this note are context-specific and influenced by our research design choices. Two of these choices are particularly important.

First, we have focused on a large sample of MSCI constituents over the past 15 years to analyze mean-reversion patterns per global industry. To illustrate the mechanics of mean-reversion, we focused on this setting for reasons of statistical power in a broad context while still controlling for business model similarities. Clearly, if the objective of the analysis is to search for 'optimal' EEQ forecasts, the analysis would likely zoom in on subsets of firms with more similar characteristics (e.g., firms in Developed Markets only, or firms within the same country-industry, firms of similar size, etc.).

Second, a number of our analyses, graphs and metrics are conditional on the firm surviving over the relevant forecast horizon. This fact could introduce so-called survivorship bias, and this will affect some of our analysis and graphs more than others. For example, the fade diagrams (Exhibit 8-11) and related graphs (Exhibit 14-17) do not require survivorship. If companies drop out in years later than the base year, they are simply not included in the calculation of medians of the future realizations. By contrast, to compute the correlations between current and future realizations (to construct the degree of mean reversion statistics -e.g. Exhibit 20 or 21), the firm does need to 'survive'.

Two points are worth mentioning in this context: 1) it is encouraging to see that at the aggregate level the relative rankings of industries is similar whether we focus on fade diagrams or Spearman correlations; 2) to carry out EEQ analysis for forecasting, the implicit assumptions will always be that the firms studied are going concerns.

Exhibit 26 At the industry level, larger absolute EEQ-consensus forecast gaps map into larger consensus forecast errors for sales growth (correlation=0.80) …

# "Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future."

# (Niels Bohr)

- Knowing how extreme a firm's current growth or profitability is and how strongly these metrics mean-revert in the economic setting in which the firm operates are key inputs to the forecasting process.

At first sight, the extent to which mean-reversion affects the accuracy of forecasts can seem a bit surprising. To put things into perspective, the degree of mean-reversion for a certain metric is just one of the factors that make forecasting such a difficult task and, as discussed, estimating EEQ forecasts is context-contingent and often not feasible.

However, to address the apparent under-appraisal of EEQ in forecasting growth and profitability (and ultimately EPS forecasts), an awareness of the phenomenon and its effects is a useful starting point. To illustrate, in this section we provide some more context in two steps:

1. We observe historical patterns (bounds) of changes in operating metrics.  
2. We provide 'numerical' guidance on mean-reversion estimates of changes in operating metrics.

# STEP 1: Observing historical patterns

# Extreme quintiles map into extreme forecasts

## 1. Sales Growth

Typically, the level of current sales growth will 'guide' expectations about future sales growth. Exhibit 28 shows the distribution of next year's change in sales growth across current sales growth quintiles. $^{13}$  The pattern suggests that the observations with the lowest current sales growth exhibit mostly a positive change in sales growth over both horizons, and those with the highest current sales growth exhibit mostly a negative change in sales growth.

In addition, the location of the quintile distributions varies around the overall median sales growth (close to zero – the red

line) across current growth quintiles. The interquartile ranges of next year's sales growth in the extreme quintiles are completely separated from the overall median – consistent with mean-reverting behaviour. This pattern is even more pronounced if we rerun the analysis for the average change in sales growth over the next five years, shown in Exhibit 29.

# The degree of mean-reversion across industry groups contributes to this variation …

Exhibit 30 shows that differentiating between weakly and strongly mean-reverting industries accentuates the pattern we observe across current growth quintiles.<sup>14</sup>

# … and affects the accuracy of analyst forecasts

The accuracy of analyst sales forecasts is affected by the strength of mean-reversion in sales growth, even over a short forecast horizon. Exhibit 31 shows that the distribution of absolute sales forecast errors across weak and strong mean-reversion industries is distinct: not only is the median absolute forecast error in the strong mean-reversion industries higher, the distribution of forecast errors in the strong mean-reversion industries is wider, consistent with more uncertainty about future outcomes.[15]

## 2. Profitability

Running this analysis for ROA produces a very similar overall pattern. Both the current ROA quintile and extent of mean-reversion appear to affect the distribution of future ROA and therefore establish priors for forecasting. Again, the accuracy of analyst forecasts appears to be affected by the degree of mean-reversion of ROA. $^{16}$

# STEP 2: Providing numerical guidance for forecasts

Historical patterns suggest that EEQ analysis can guide the forecasting exercise, especially for stocks that are potentially 'vulnerable' from an EEQ perspective.

To illustrate, we estimate mean-reversion estimates of growth and profitability for the current constituents of the MSCI ACWI for which we can have 2011 financial statements. We obtain the forecasts by estimating recursive regressions per industry-quintile of forward on current growth and profitability using data that spans the period 2000-2010.

The regressions help us to obtain firm-specific mean-reversion forecasts that take into account both the current value of growth and profitability of the firm and the mean-reverting behavior of these metrics in the firm's industry-quintile.

# 1. Growth

To highlight the industry-quintiles most 'vulnerable' to sales growth mean-reversion effects, Exhibit 36 lists the 10 industries with the most extreme forecasted change in sales growth. We focus on quintiles 1 and 2 of each sales growth industry distribution to single out those industry-quintiles with the largest forecasted sales growth increase. Conversely, we zoom in on the higher quintiles 4 and 5 to select the industry quintiles with the largest forecasted drop in sales growth. The Exhibit list median values for each metric reported.

The exhibit shows that the lowest quintile of the Energy Equipment & Services shows the largest median forecasted sales growth increase (32.1%). Using 2011 figures, this industry quintile reported a median sales growth of -11.4%. Next in line is the Semiconductor industry with both its quintile 1 and 2 exhibiting large forecasted sales growth increases. On the other side of the distribution, quintile 5 of the Chemicals industry is forecasted to see a drop of  $32\%$  in sales growth (starting from a base of current sales growth of  $49\%$ ).

Overall, the five industry quintiles with the largest forecasted sales growth increase start from a base of  $-8.6\%$  current sales growth and a forecasted change in sales growth of  $19.2\%$ . The corresponding numbers for the industry-quintiles with the largest forecasted drop in sales growth are  $48.0\%$  and  $25.3\%$ .

# 2. Profitability

We carry out the same analysis with a focus on ROA and list the industry quintiles with the largest forecasted ROA change in Exhibit 37. We can highlight two industries that show up on both lists of forecasted extreme ROA changes: Electronic Equipment & Components and Metals & Mining. The former shows a forecasted ROA change of  $1.9\%$  for its quintile 1 and forecasted change of  $-3.1\%$  for its current quintile 5; the corresponding figures for Metals & Mining are  $2.4\%$  and  $-5.1\%$ . Also noteworthy is that the Semiconductors industry is again listed, this time among the industries with the largest forecasted ROA decrease.

Overall, the industry-quintiles with the largest forecasted ROA increases start from an average current base of  $3.0\%$  and exhibit an average increase of  $1.8\%$ ; the corresponding quintiles with the largest forecasted drops in ROA start at a level of  $23.6\%$  and an average forecasted change of  $-3.9\%$ .

# The bottom line

Exhibit 36 and Exhibit 37 illustrate how EEQ analysis can help in a practical context. While these mean-reversion forecasts should not necessarily be taken at face-value – given they are based exclusively on the latest value and historical patterns for each metric – they do serve as a useful benchmark to evaluate forecasts that incorporate news and additional information. Forecasts that resist the pull of mean-reversion require support from clear arguments as to why things will be different this time around. Mean-reversion forecasts also serve as a reminder that operational metrics in certain industries are inherently more difficult to forecast than in others.

# Appendix A: Methodology

This appendix complements and summarizes the methodology discussions in this note.

# Operational Metrics

Our universe consists of non-financial MSCI ACWI constituents over the period 1995-2010. We use FactSet Fundamentals to define our operational variables as follows:

Sales growth  $=$  Sales  $/$  Sales  $t - 1$

Return on Assets  $(\mathsf{ROA}_{\mathsf{t}}) = \mathsf{EBIT}_{\mathsf{t}} / \mathsf{Average~Total~Assets}_{\mathsf{t}}$

Operating Margin  $(\mathrm{OPM_t}) = \mathrm{EBIT_t} / \mathrm{Sales_t}$

Asset Turnover  $(\mathsf{ATO}_t) =$  Sales/ Average Total Assets

# Construction of quintiles - Fade Diagrams

To construct the Fade Diagrams we first form annual quintiles of the metric of interest per GICS industry. We compute the annual medians of each quintile across all industries for the year of portfolio formation and for each of the five years post formation. We refer to the year of portfolio creation as the base or current year. Next, we take the mean of the annual quintile medians across all available years and plot them to construct the fade diagram. We only consider industry/year observations if they contain 15 observations or more.

We measure the degree of mean-reversion of the metrics in two ways: 1) the rate of mean-reversion is the ratio between the difference of Q5 and Q1 medians (scaled by the overall median) in the base year vs. FY5 (five years post-quintile formation) 2) 1 minus the Spearman correlation between the current metric and its realization five years post quintile formation per GICS industry.

While the first metric requires that we define quintiles per metric in each industry/year, the second one does not. Further, as discussed in the note, the first metric does not require survivorship of observations, whereas the second does.

# Industry group graphs

We construct the industry group ranking by carrying out the quintile analysis at the industry group level. That is, we construct fade diagrams at the industry group level and use the quintile summary metrics to construct industry group-specific rates of mean-reversion ratios as defined earlier. The graphs show the level of attrition between the top and the bottom

quintile for a given metric between the year of quintile formation and five years later.

# EPS accuracy analysis

To construct the EPS accuracy test, we measure FY1 and FY2 median consensus EPS estimates as of 1 month post the most recent annual results. We eliminate consensus estimates based on fewer than three estimates. We measure the accuracy of the EPS forecasts as the Spearman correlation of the forecast and its subsequent realization. (Note that we scale each EPS metric by the price per share as of the date of the forecast). We measure the degree of mean-reversion of ROA using the Spearman approach discussed.

To construct the correlation graphs, we carry out the analysis at the industry level and measure annual industry Spearman correlations. Next, we average the annual industry correlation to get an overall degree-of-mean-reversion metric per industry over the period studied. For each computed Spearman correlation we require at least 15 observations.

# Benchmarking the consensus analysis

We benchmark median consensus forecasts of sales and EBIT (ROA) using mean-reversion based forecasts constructed using recursive regressions of 1-year forward metrics on current metrics. For example:

Sales Growth $_{t+1} = \alpha + \beta * Sales Growth_t + \varepsilon_t$ , where  $\varepsilon_t$  is the error term

We estimate these regressions using five years of data within each quintile of each industry to obtain out-of-sample forecasts. For example, to build EEQ forecasts of ROA in 2011, we use ROA data from 2006-2010. Using the intercept and the slope of each industry quintile regression, we can construct an out-of-sample forecast of ROA for 2011. We require at least 10 observations per regression.

We measure the absolute forecast gap for sales growth as the difference between the mean-reversion and the consensus median forecast of FY1 sales scaled by current sales. The forecast error is the percent difference between median consensus FY1 sales and future realized sales.

In the case of ROA, we measure the absolute forecast gap as the nominal difference between mean-reversion estimates of FY1 EBIT and median consensus FY1 EBIT. Since analysts provide FY1 forecasts of total assets relatively infrequently, we alter the definition of ROA slightly here by scaling the FY1 EBIT forecasts by average assets. The forecast error is the difference between consensus median FY1 EBIT and its realization scaled by average assets.

We measure the degree of mean-reversion per industry using the Spearman correlation approach discussed earlier.

# Historical pattern analysis

To construct the historical pattern graphs, we graph the box plot distribution of next year's or next 5 years change in sales growth or ROA across the quintiles of the current distribution of the metrics. In other words, the graphs show the pooled distribution of the change metrics across the sample period.

We construct the forecast error graphs using the definitions for sales growth and ROA forecast error discussed earlier.

# Numerical guidance analysis

We estimate mean-reversion estimates of sales growth and ROA for the current constituents of the MSCI ACWI for which we have 2011 financial statements in three steps.

1. We obtain the forecasts by estimating recursive regressions (as defined before) per industry-quintile of forward growth (profitability) on current growth (profitability) using data that spans the period 2000-2010. We require at least 10 observations per regression.
2. We classify the available 2011 observations in industry-quintiles. We require at least five observations per industry to define the quintiles.
3. We use the estimated intercepts and slopes per industry-quintile to construct out-of-sample forecasts using the 2011 realizations. Using the forecasted sales growth and ROA we can compute the forecasted change from current 2011 values.

The exhibits in the note report the medians of all metrics per relevant industry-quintile.

# Appendix B: What explains the differences in ROA mean-reversion between industry groups?

Two broad factors are relevant here, we think: how a firm generates its return on assets, and the intensity of the competition it faces.

# 1. How a firm generates returns – high operating margins or high asset turnover

At a mechanical level, the mean-reversion of the components of ROA will of course affect the mean-reversion of ROA. As ROA is the product of operating margin and asset turnover, the properties of ROA will follow from how the firm achieves its return on assets. Does the firm 'command margins' or does it 'work its assets in an efficient way'? Perhaps it does both. Indeed, the nature of the business will determine what flexibility the firm has to achieve its ROA objective.

Industrial economists typically focus on the trade-off between operating margin and asset turnover in achieving ROA. $^{17}$  Exhibit 38 shows a clear negative correlation between the level of OPM and the level of ATO across industry groups: Food & Staples Retailing achieves the lowest OPM and highest ATO, while both Telecoms and Utilities are at the other end of the spectrum with low ATO and high margins.

Exhibit 38 Achieving ROA - the trade-off between OPM and ATO (correlation=-0.72)  
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-30/b71e2b5d-4b08-430d-92ed-9a68dcfe823a/7db0ade4a9a77f94d0cd2fa36e432a912a68dbea44ce3ae3292d749dab82991a.jpg)  
Source: FactSet, Morgan Stanley Research

Given the difference in rates of mean-reversion for OPM and ATO, how firms achieve their ROA will also affect the degree of mean-reversion in the industry. Exhibit 39 and Exhibit 40 show that the rate of ROA mean-reversion has a weak positive correlation with the level of OPM and a negative correlation with the level of ATO.

# 2. The competitiveness of the industry

The level of competition in an industry also helps explain profitability levels and their persistence. Stronger mean-reversion is consistent with higher levels of competition. To illustrate this, we look at three metrics that capture aspects of the level of competition firms face:

1. growth  $(+)$  - higher growth typically means higher mean-reversion  
2. concentration (-) - mean-reversion tends to be lower in concentrated industries  
3. the number of firms in the industry  $(+)$  - the more firms, the higher mean-reversion tends to be

We measure growth by aggregating firm sales growth by industry, and assume that higher growth will increase the competitiveness in an industry. We measure concentration by computing industry Herfindahl-Hirschman indices (using sales as the primary variable). We calculate the metrics annually and compare them on the basis of their average over our sample period.

All three competition-related metrics affect the extent of industry ROA mean-reversion, as Exhibit 41 shows, although the strength of the relationship is weaker than with operating margins and asset turnover.

Combining all five metrics suggests a rank correlation of 0.42 with ROA mean-reversion, shown in Exhibit 42Error! Reference source not found.. If we exclude the industry with the largest deviation from the regression line (Commercial Services - IG code 2530), the correlation increases to 0.59.
