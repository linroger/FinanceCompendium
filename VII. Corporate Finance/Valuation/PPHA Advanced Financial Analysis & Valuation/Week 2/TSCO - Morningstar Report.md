# Business Strategy and Outlook 01 Feb 2019

Tractor Supply is the largest consumer farm specialty retailer in the United States, with nearly $8 billion in annual sales. The firm has differentiated itself through its products and customer demographics, which provide underlying support to its brand intangible assets and a narrow economic moat. The store base has grown about 40% over the past five years, to about 1,765 locations (1,940 including Petsense), driving sales and EPS compound annual growth rates over the past three years of 8% and 12%, respectively. We forecast that the firm will grow to nearly 2,900 stores over the next decade as it populates big-box centers in the western half of the U.S., with Petsense accounting for about 450 locations.

The firm competes with big-box retailers like PetSmart and Lowe's, which also have solid pricing power because of scale and distribution advantages across numerous categories. That said, we believe Tractor Supply derives its success from its customer-centric store layout, which makes it a destination store for many of its customers. In addition, since Tractor Supply focuses on an active do-it-yourself rural consumer, many of its products are higher-end than those found in retailers that focus on a casual consumer.

We believe that Tractor Supply is positioned to reach critical mass in its consumer segment over the next decade, but that consistent operating margin expansion depends on corporate development across arenas, including better customer attribution data, better bargaining with vendors, and more sophisticated logistics. These types of projects can increase operating margins meaningfully and have benefited both Home Depot and Lowe's over the last decade. With the New York distribution center fully operational in 2019, lower freight costs and better local vendor purchasing power should prevail, but investments to improve the firm's offerings, perception and relevance will weigh on near-term operating margin expansion. Over time, improved gross margin results from strong private-label penetration and better merchandising could be offset by SG&A growth, leading to operating margins that rise about 20 basis points on average annually, from  $9\%$  in 2018.

# Morningstar Analysis

# Fair Value & Profit Drivers 01 Feb 2019

We are increasing our fair value estimate to  $93 per share from$ 90 after incorporating 2018 results. Expenses to finance OneTractor initiatives, the rollout of the Stockyard kiosks and mobile point-of-sale systems, and supply chain improvements could still pressure near-term operating margin expansion before beginning to pay off in the second half of 2019. Our fair value estimate implies a 2019 price/earnings ratio of 20 times and an enterprise value/EBITDA multiple of 12 times. This is versus a five-year historical P/E based on fair value of 25 times and an EV/EBITDA multiple of 13 times and a forecast for low-double-digit earnings growth over the majority of our outlook.

While some of the categories that Tractor Supply operates in are relatively mature, we view the breadth of its offerings and potential for growth of its current consumer base as well as increased penetration of new consumers as positive factors that could drive top-line growth. We project that total sales can grow at  $6\%$  over the next five years (after rising  $9\%$  in 2018) supported by low-single-digit comparable-store sales  $(3\%)$  and mid-single-digit square footage growth. We forecast gross margins to rise moderately over the next decade (by roughly 60 basis points, to  $35\%$ ), constrained by our belief that e-commerce retailers can compete in about  $30\%$  of the sales areas Tractor Supply operates within. We forecast the selling, general, and administrative expense ratio to leverage 70 basis points to  $22.2\%$  from 2018 results as the business continues to improve its relationships with vendors and strengthen its supply chain as its footprint scales, while spending on infrastructure.

The company expects 10-50 total basis points in operating margin expansion by 2021 (from 2018) to  $9\% - 9.4\%$ , and our assumptions incorporate margin expansion of about 20 basis points annually over the next decade (with an operating margin of  $9.3\%$  in 2021), helped by more

consistent improvements later in our forecast. Over the next five years, we project a rising double-digit return on invested capital rate versus our  $9\%$  cost of capital assumption, providing support for our narrow economic moat view.

# Scenario Analysis

We use a scenario analysis to help assess the upside and downside potential of Tractor Supply's intrinsic value. We believe the company has a medium uncertainty rating due to the strong brand recognition, which has helped stabilize sales through the cycle. In our upside scenario, we assume faster-than-expected square footage growth, driving higher total and comp store sales at Tractor Supply. Gross margins rise to  $36\%$ , as vendor negotiations are increasingly in the company's favor and inflation remains tempered. Additionally, the implementation of additional supply chain initiatives and improved sales allow the SG&A ratio to leverage to below  $22\%$ , together generating operating margins above  $12\%$ . If the company manages to hit these financial metrics, our fair value estimate would be $119 per share.

In our downside scenario, we would expect a slowdown in the economic environment taking a toll on the firm's casual clientele and depressing total and comp store sales. The company might fail to realize benefits from its West Coast and Northeast distribution centers, driving higher-than-expected SG&A expenses, leading to costs that are around  $23\%$  of sales over the next few years. Store footage growth would be lower than anticipated in response to slower demand with about 90 fewer locations than in our base case. With mix working against the company and efficiencies lagging expectations, gross margins stagnate around  $34\%$  and the operating margin falls between  $7\%$  and  $9\%$  through 2025. In our downside case, the fair value estimate would be $67.

For reference, over the past five years, Tractor Supply's cost of goods sold averaged  $66 \%$ of sales, while the SG&A ratio came in at  $22 \%$ of sales. In our model, a  $1 \%$ change in each

# Economic Moat

Tractor Supply's brand and product mix have built a loyal following of recreational farmers, ranchers, and those participating in the rural lifestyle, supporting a narrow moat built on a solid brand intangible asset. The niche product offerings place Tractor Supply in a unique position, insulated from peers that focus on one segment of the market--Tractor Supply's breadth across categories (equine, livestock, pet and small animal products; hardware, truck, towing and tool products; seasonal products; work/recreational clothing and footwear; and maintenance products) provides a one-stop solution (and destination) for those looking to fill multiple needs across outdoor categories.

We believe the business' ability to cater to a more recreational outdoor hobbyist lends the business to higher income demographics, and less revenue cyclicality. It has been estimated that less than  $10\%$  of customers are

classified as full-time farmers and ranchers, and the largest customer segment does not farm at all. The positive news here is that IBISWorld indicates the hobby farmer consumers generate about $15 billion annually in revenue for farm supply stores, and farm supply products represent only a portion of Tractor Supply's merchandise selection implying room for growth--seasonal and parts of other categories not directly tied to farming alone constitute at least 25% of sales in our estimation.

In our opinion, the resilient consumer base allows for more consistent revenue growth through both expanded footprint and price increases, which are indicated by improving gross margins ahead. We suspect gross margin improvement can come from multiple sources (better product offerings, more seasonal, more private label), which should be sustainable or improved upon longer term. We believe Tractor Supply is somewhat insulated from competitive pricing pressure from Home Depot and Lowe's in overlapping product categories, due to the company's focus on rural presence, versus its competitors more urban/suburban focus.

With private label/exclusive brands becoming a more important part of sales (31% of 2018 revenue), and having a disparate positive impact on gross margins by a few hundred basis points at least, the upward trend should be reasonable to achieve, particularly as consumers become more tied to these specific brands which are solely distributed at Tractor Supply. Private label is meaningful among the consumable, usable, and edible products the company sells and includes key products that customers use on a regular basis--making those end users become repeat customers--like pet food, seasonal products, livestock feed, and pest control. The increased emphasis on immediate-need, or CUE, products (which we estimate to represent  $40\% -50\%$  of sales) could tick gross margins higher on a sustainable basis, indicating the company's pricing power and the strength of its brand. While some CUE products generate lower merchandise margins, the

increased frequency of consumer visits drives adjacent product sales with higher margins. Additionally, Tractor Supply should be able to raise gross margins as it increases its scale in multiple categories.

More important, the management team is developing the business to continue to succeed. Solid focus on culture (Tractor Value System) and the business holistically (Team, Sales, Customer and Execution) gives the company good footing to resonate with its consumers going forward. TVS was launched in 2006 in order to reduce waste, cost, and improve efficiencies throughout the organization. Ultimately, this process identifies areas that need improvement, which eventually leads to innovation and shorter lead times as new processes are implemented. This expedites newer product in the channel with better technological features, allowing for consistent price increases. TSC&E is all about cultivating a lean environment without sacrificing quality of merchandise or customer service. Building a team from the customer base, and rewarding employees based on success helps develop the right leader to take the business forward. Newer efforts, like the OneTractor initiative, increasing customer engagement through digital technology, better CRM, expanded supply chain capabilities in order to better serve customers, caters to the evolving consumer landscape, helping to ensure the company's brand intangible asset remains intact.

Overall, all of these points have helped Tractor Supply deliver average adjusted returns on invested capital of  $18\%$  during the past five years, after coming off a massive housing downturn and recession. We believe this metric should rebound back above the five-year average over the next five years (to  $19\%$  in fiscal 2023) after current investments slow and begin to pay off (versus our cost of capital assumption of  $9\%$ .) We still think the familiarity of the brand and improving knowledge levels of the employee

base keeps the business in the forefront of consumers' minds as the premier choice for outdoor hobby and pet needs.

We are confident that the brand intangible asset will continue to be relevant and will benefit Tractor Supply for at least another 10 years, as we find it difficult to believe any new entrant would be able to enter the market with scale across the numerous categories the company has operated in retailing. While we think new competitors could enter through the e-commerce channel, in our opinion they would be limited to operating in few and particular categories because of the prohibitive shipping costs numerous products entail. Additionally, shipping in general is more expensive in rural areas, where households are farther apart and delivery routes are longer.

# Moat Trend

Tractor Supply's moat trend is stable, in our view. We think the company can continue to capture growth in the recreational farming and ranching category, as it expands its brick-and-mortar footprint and implements a more localized focus on merchandising supported by its nationally known brand. We expect Tractor Supply to achieve either a stable or improving cost structure as its economies of scale rise and additional distribution centers helps reduce supply chain costs once operational. While smaller competitors could offer some commodified products at competitive price points, we believe they would not be able to offer either the private label or exclusive products that Tractor Supply has (representing more than  $30\%$  of sales). Few competitors overlap with all of the categories that the company operates in, and consolidation across smaller fragmented retailers will help Tractor Supply generate stable revenue growth in the years ahead. Same-store sales growth has historically been fairly steady relative to home improvement peers Home Depot and Lowe's during the weak part of the cycle, and continues to have a better forward potential

(management's goal is to achieve same-store sales of above  $3 \%$ annually, slightly higher than the  $2 \text{‰} - 3 \%$ we estimate) than other big box competitors like Walmart, that are increasingly competing against ecommerce companies threatening to steal share.

As Tractor Supply's footprint continues to increase, we could see the implementation of further distribution, supply chain, and inventory management plans that could set the company up to achieve operating margins that reach prior peak levels (more than  $10\%$ ), following suit of companies like Home Depot and Lowe's in recent years (however, as the company spends on these initiatives we would expect them to weigh on interim operating margin potential). In this case, we would reassess the company's trend to ascertain whether it has established a positive trend.

# Bulls Say/Bears Say

# Bulls Say

- Tractor Supply still has room for store growth, which should help it achieve its low-double-digit EPS growth target over the next five years. Faster footprint growth at Petsense could lead to faster sales growth than we currently forecast.  
The firm's unique merchandise assortment partially insulates it from e-commerce competitors, offering products that have either immediate need or are expensive to ship.  
- With the New York distribution center now open, the firm should be able to leverage expenses better, leading to improving distribution costs.

# Bears Say

- Prior square footage growth goals of  $8\%$  are lofty for Tractor Supply's locations alone, particularly if new stores have a smaller footprint. The firm could get closer with Petsense locations.  
- Optimal real estate opportunities could become difficult to capture as the firm expands further into competitors' markets and real estate prices stabilize or rise in many areas.  
Free cash flow could be tempered in the near term as the company increases its capital expenditures to expand its footprint on the West Coast and further build out its distribution network.

# Financial Strength

Tractor Supply carries about  $400 million in total debt consisting of a senior note, term loans, and credit facility on its balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2018 (maturing in 2022). Growth is financed through funds from operations, cash on hand, and the company's credit facility, with any excess cash allocated to both dividends and share repurchases. Neither capital nor operating leases seem burdensome for Tractor Supply, as we believe operating cash flow could cover such costs even in lean times. This business model could support an incremental amount of leverage on the balance sheet, offering extra dry powder in the event of an extended cyclical downturn or the identification of an interesting acquisition target. The company's maximum leverage target is 2 times. The firm generated average annual free cash flow of about$ 330 million over the past five years, despite an uncertain macro environment coming out of the most recent recession. With measured footprint growth in the periods ahead (4% forecast on average over the next decade in our model, including Petsense locations) the company should be able to afford its expansion as well as planned repurchases. The company plans to pay out 30% of its net income in dividends (currently at $0.31 per share per quarter) and reduce its share count through repurchases around 3% on average annually. Tractor Supply leases more than 90% of its stores, leaving it with little property plant and equipment on its balance sheet to secure cheap debt.

# Risk & Uncertainty

We've assigned Tractor Supply a medium uncertainty rating despite operating in a cyclical retail environment in which consumers' spending habits in large part drive sales. Tractor Supply's target demographic is fairly affluent, which helped insulate the firm somewhat during the recession (generating same-store sales of  $1\%$  in 2008 and negative  $1\%$  in 2009). While we believe some segments of the business could be swayed by weather (lawn and garden, heating) or the

performance of the housing market (clothing, tools), we think sales from the CUE product categories, including pet food, livestock, and equine categories, will offer stability in the revenue cycle. In markets and product categories that Tractor Supply overlaps with other big-box retailers (Home Depot, Lowe's, PetSmart, Walmart), we think the company could be forced to be a price taker, which could weigh on local profits. Additionally, there are no barriers to entry to prevent new competitors from operating in any of the firm's markets, although with numerous sizable operators (Home Depot, Walmart) already in many markets, we'd find it difficult to see how a smaller, less nimble business would be able to offer similar product prices, as it probably would not have vendor relationships of the same strength. With our forecast for more than 2,400 Tractor Supply and 450 Petsense stores over the next decade, the firm risks oversaturation and cannibalization of sales in established locations, however, we expect some localized merchandise selection could prevent this. We still believe risk lies in competition from the e-commerce channel, particularly in categories that have been commodified. The biggest risk, in our opinion, is a slowdown in domestic economic growth, which could lead to declines in home sales pricing, higher unemployment, or slowing income growth levels.

# Stewardship 01 Feb 2019

Tractor Supply's management has proved to be an exemplary steward of shareholder capital, in our view. Greg Sandfort became CEO in 2012 after spending some time in the CFO and CMO positions at the firm and holding leadership roles at other consumer firms. In 2017, Sandfort was given about $6.7 million in total compensation, with a significant portion (more than  $70\%$ ) in stock and option awards, as well as deferred comp. We believe executive compensation is reasonable, given the company's positioning and history of operating results and returns. Furthermore, the mix of base salary, annual or short-term incentives, and long-term incentives that reward company and individual performance generally ties in well to the long-term creation of shareholder value.

Although executive officers and directors in aggregate own just under  $2\%$  of Tractor Supply's common stock as of the most recent proxy, we believe the absolute dollars invested are enough to align their interests with shareholders'. Board members are also expected to hold shares of the company with a market value equal or greater than 5 times the director's annual cash retainer within five years, aligning the board's interest with shareholders as well. The board of directors is sufficiently independent, with eight of the nine members from outside the organization, and we like that the members are up for re-election annually. The top three shareholders control  $22\%$  of shares, which could sway the outcome of issues to be voted upon.

The solid ROICs that the management team has delivered (18% average annually over the past five years) indicate to us that the team is investing in value-added initiatives, which we expect to persist. We like that the company is forward-looking and is making changes to its capital structure in anticipation of improved performance ahead--the increase in common stock availability (from 200 million units to 400 million units in 2014) offers Tractor Supply flexibility in its capital structure to issue shares for

future stock dividends and splits, acquisitions, capital-raising transactions consisting of equity or convertible debt, equity-based incentive plans, and for other general corporate purposes. The capital-allocation strategy remains well rounded, split between investing for growth (an estimated $250 million-$300 million annually) and returning cash to shareholders through dividends (payout target of 30%) and share repurchases.

# Tractor Supply Merchandising Continues to Drive Store Traffic, Boosting Sales; Shares Fairly Valued 31 Jan 2019

Narrow-moat Tractor Supply remains an anomaly in retailing, keeping customer traffic driving to stores thanks to its differentiated product and category mix (31% in private label sales). While we suspect investors were disappointed that Tractor's 2019 forecast called for same-store sales of  $2\% -4\%$  after generating three quarters of above  $5\%$  performance, we believe this outlook is pragmatic and takes into account the type of growth that consumer companies encounter after a long period of economic expansion, which can remain positive but slower. Additionally, the forecast for flat operating margin performance, at  $8.9\%$  to  $9\%$ , which fell just short of the  $9.1\%$  our 2019 forecast incorporated, indicates further expense headwinds (logistics, inflation) could persist. Furthermore, the pruning of 10 PetSense locations leaves concern that further location closures could slow the brand's growth, with boxes set to grow around  $8\%$  in 2019 versus the original outlook for  $15\%$  growth at acquisition.

That said, we still think Tractor Supply remains one of the best-positioned firms to weather both a cyclical downturn and the secular shift to e-commerce that continues to persist given its exposure to less elastic CUE products and customers' loyalty to private-label products. We don't plan to alter our $90 fair value estimate materially and view shares as fairly valued, trading at 18 times the midpoint of 2019 EPS guidance ($4.60-$4.75). Our prior 2019 EPS outlook for $4.63 was supported by same-store sales of 3%, sales of $8.4 billion (in line with Tractor's $8.31 billion-$8.46 billion guidance), and net income of $568 million (versus the $555 million-$575 million Tractor expects). This growth tunes into our longer-term outlook, which seeks 2.5%-3% comp growth, an average of 70 annual Tractor store openings, and modest operating margin expansion (to 9.5% in 2022 from 8.9% in 2018), as the firm continues to spend on IT initiatives and further build out its distribution network.

Strong fourth-quarter results followed suit with recent quarters, with sales that increased to  $9\%$ , to  $\$2.1$  billion, helped by samestore sales growth of  $5.7\%$  (ahead of our  $3 \%$  forecast). Total comp was supported by average transaction value that rose  $3 \%$  while transaction count hiked  $2.6\%$ . The gross margin contracted 60 basis points, to  $33.6\%$ , as Tractor was plagued by higher freight expenses (which should begin to lap in the second half), mix, PetSense clearance, and inventory rationalization. The SG&A ratio including depreciation ticked up 30 basis points to  $25.1\%$ , due to inflated incentive expenses and firm investments (infrastructure, labor, technology) weighed on the metric. All in, this led to an operating margin  $8.5\%$ , the lowest fourth quarter mark since the recession (fourth-quarter 2010).

Despite weak operating performance, the company is set to move into the second half of 2019 with the ability to leverage its expenses more easily. First, the new distribution center that began taking inventory in the fourth quarter will be fully operational, acting as less of a drag on expenses. Second, Tractor will begin to lap inflated logistics costs in the second half, on both carrier and fuel fronts. And finally, the benefit of initiatives including the further rollout of the Stockyard kiosks and mobile point of sales systems, as well as efforts to optimize the utilization of data being gathered by the 10 million member Neighbors Club, should help both merchandising and conversion. This should drive modest year-over-year operating margin improvement in the company's second half, which should average about  $8.5\%$  in 2019 versus  $8.3\%$  in 2018.

# Analyst Notes

same-store sales growth of 5% and a revenue increase of 9%, well ahead of our 1.8% and 5% forecasts, respectively, helped by normal weather and strong merchandising. Given the persistent demand strength through the year, management again raised its 2018 guidance, with sales of $7.84 billion-$7.87 billion (versus $7.77 billion-$7.80 billion prior and our $7.8 billion outlook) and earnings per share of $4.23-$4.27 (ahead of our $4.12 estimate). We plan to increase our $84 fair value estimate by about $4 after incorporating recent results, and view shares as fairly valued, trading at nearly 20 times our 2019 EPS estimate, versus midteens EPS growth in our forecast over the next five years.

While it appears Tractor Supply is set to post its best annual comps since 2013, we don't think the company's long-term opportunity set has changed and plan to maintain our long-term outlook, which calls for average sales growth  $6 \%$ and operating margins of  $10 \%$ Any upside stemming from efforts surrounding the OneTractor initiative are bound by investments to continue to build out both the business infrastructure (supply chain) and IT efforts (point of sale, kiosks), which keep capital and operating expenses inflated and profitability from expanding beyond a lowdoubledigit pace. The Neighbor's Club loyalty program (now 9.7 million members) remains a catalyst for sales expansion, as historically, these customers shop 3 to 4 times more often than nonmembers and should help bolster the brand intangible asset, which underlies our narrow moat rating.

There was a plethora of positive data points offered, including comp transaction values that rose  $3.6\%$ , comp transaction count that increased  $1.4\%$ , and 25 consecutive quarters of double-digit increases in the e-commerce business. Additionally, we think Tractor Supply is finally beginning to optimize its e-commerce and brick-and-mortar dynamic, with  $70\%$  of the company's online orders fulfilled at the store level, which has been noted to lead to a  $20\%$

attachment rate, and is likely to help leverage occupancy costs. The only notable offsets on the negative side were on freight expense increases (something that is being felt across numerous retailers) and labor wages. We generally view other inflated technology investments in the business as necessary in order to remain competitive and relevant to consumers, protecting the brand.

# Research Methodology for Valuing Companies

# Qualitative Equity Research Overview

At the heart of our valuation system is a detailed projection of a company's future cash flows, resulting from our analysts' research. Analysts create custom industry and company assumptions to feed income statement, balance sheet, and capital investment assumptions into our globally standardized, proprietary discounted cash flow, or DCF, modeling templates. We use scenario analysis, in-depth competitive advantage analysis, and a variety of other analytical tools to augment this process. We believe this bottom-up, long-term, fundamentally based approach allows our analysts to focus on long-term business drivers, which have the greatest valuation impact, rather than short-term market noise.

Morningstar's equity research group ("we," "our") believes that a company's intrinsic worth results from the future cash flows it can generate. The Morningstar Rating for stocks identifies stocks trading at an uncertainty-adjusted discount or premium to their intrinsic worth—or fair value estimate, in Morningstar terminology. Five-star stocks sell for the biggest risk-adjusted discount to their fair values whereas 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.

Four key components drive the Morningstar rating: (1) our assessment of the firm's economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock's fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process ultimately culminates in our single-point star rating.

# 1. Economic Moat

The concept of an economic moat plays a vital role not only in our qualitative assessment of a firm's long-term investment potential, but also in the actual calculation of our fair value estimates. An economic moat is a structural feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period of time. We define excess economic profits as returns on invested capital (or ROIC) over and above our estimate of a firm's cost of capital, or weighted average cost of capital (or WACC). Without a moat, profits are more susceptible to competition. We have identified five sources of economic moats:

intangible assets, switching costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.

Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are more likely than not to achieve normalized excess returns for at least the next 10 years. Wide-moat companies are those in which we have very high confidence that excess returns will remain for 10 years, with excess returns more likely than not to remain for at least 20 years. The longer a firm generates economic profits, the higher its intrinsic value. We believe low-quality no-moat companies will see their normalized returns gravitate toward the firm's cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.

To assess the direction of the underlying competitive advantages, analysts perform ongoing assessments of the moat trend. A firm's moat trend is positive in cases where we think its sources of competitive advantage are growing stronger; stable where we don't anticipate changes to competitive advantages over the next several years; or negative when we see signs of deterioration.

All the moat and moat trend ratings undergo periodic review and any changes must be approved by the Morningstar Economic Moat Committee, comprised of senior members of Morningstar's equity research department.

# 2. Estimated Fair Value

Combining our analysts' financial forecasts with the firm's economic moat helps us assess how long returns on invested capital are likely to exceed the firm's cost of capital. Returns of firms with a wide economic moat rating are assumed to fade to the perpetuity period over a longer period of time than the returns of narrow-moat firms, and both will fade slower than no-moat firms, increasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.

Our model is divided into three distinct stages:

# Stage I: Explicit Forecast

In this stage, which can last five to 10 years, analysts make full financial statement forecasts, including items such as revenue, profit margins, tax rates, changes in working-capital accounts, and capital spending. Based on these projections, we calculate earnings before interest, after taxes, or EBI, and the net new investment, or NNI, to derive our annual free cash flow forecast.

# Stage II: Fade

The second stage of our model is the period it will take the company's return on new invested capital — the return on capital of the next dollar invested ("RONIC") — to decline (or rise) to its cost of capital. During the Stage II period, we use a formula to approximate cash flows in lieu of explicitly modeling the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement as we do in Stage I. The length of the second stage depends on the strength of the company's economic moat. We forecast this period to last anywhere from one year (for companies with no economic moat) to 10-15 years or more (for wide-moat companies). During this period, cash flows are forecast using four assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the period, a normalized investment rate, average return on new invested capital, or RONIC, and the number of years until perpetuity, when excess returns cease. The investment rate and return on new invested capital decline until the perpetuity stage is reached. In the case of firms that do not earn their cost of capital, we assume marginal ROICs rise to the firm's cost of capital (usually attributable to less reinvestment), and we may truncate the second stage.

# Stage III: Perpetuity

Once a company's marginal ROIC hits its cost of capital, we calculate a continuing value, using a standard perpetuity formula. At perpetuity, we assume that any growth or decline or investment in the business neither creates nor destroys value and that any new investment provides a return in line with estimated WACC.

Morningstar Research Methodology for Valuing Companies

Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar earned tomorrow, we discount our projections of cash flows in stages I, II, and III to arrive at a total present value of expected future cash flows. Because we are modeling free cash flow to the firm—representing cash available to provide a return to all capital providers—we discount future cash flows using the WACC, which is a weighted average of the costs of equity, debt, and preferred stock (and any other funding sources), using expected future proportionate long-term market-value weights.

# 3. Uncertainty Around That Fair Value Estimate

Morningstar's Uncertainty Rating captures a range of likely potential intrinsic values for a company and uses it to assign the margin of safety required before investing, which in turn explicitly drives our stock star rating system. The Uncertainty Rating represents the analysts' ability to bound the estimated value of the shares in a company around the fair value estimate, based on the characteristics of the business underlying the stock, including operating and financial leverage, sales sensitivity to the overall economy, product concentration, pricing power, and other company-specific factors.

Analysts consider at least two scenarios in addition to their base case: a bull case and a bear case. Assumptions are chosen such that the analyst believes there is a  $25\%$  probability that the company will perform better than the bull case, and a  $25\%$  probability that the company will perform worse than the bear case. The distance between the bull and bear cases is an important indicator of the uncertainty underlying the fair value estimate.

Our recommended margin of safety widens as our uncertainty of the estimated value of the equity increases. The more uncertain we are about the estimated value of the equity, the greater the discount we require relative to our estimate of the value of the firm before we would recommend the purchase of the shares. In addition, the uncertainty rating provides guidance in portfolio construction based on risk tolerance.

Our uncertainty ratings for our qualitative analysis are low, medium, high, very high, and extreme.

Low-margin of safety for 5-star rating is a  $20\%$  discount and for 1-star rating is  $25\%$  premium.

Morningstar Equity Research Star Rating Methodology

# Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks

Once we determine the fair value estimate of a stock, we compare it with the stock's current market price on a daily basis, and the star rating is automatically re-calculated at the market close on every day the market on which the stock is listed is open.

Please note, there is no predefined distribution of stars. That is, the percentage of stocks that earn 5 stars can fluctuate daily, so the star ratings, in the aggregate, can serve as a gauge of the broader market's valuation. When there are many 5-star stocks, the stock market as a whole is more undervalued, in our opinion, than when very few companies garner our highest rating.

We expect that if our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years (although it is impossible to predict the exact time frame in which market prices may adjust).

Our star ratings are guideposts to a broad audience and individuals must consider their own specific investment goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, time horizon, income needs, and complete investment portfolio, among other factors.

The Morningstar Star Ratings for stocks are defined below:

$\star \star \star \star \star$  We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk-adjusted return is highly likely over a multiyear time frame. The current market price represents an excessively pessimistic outlook, limiting downside risk and maximizing upside potential.  
$\star \star \star \star$  We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk-adjusted return is likely.  
$\text{★★★}$  Indicates our belief that investors are likely to receive a fair risk-adjusted return (approximately cost of equity).  
$\star \star$  We believe investors are likely to receive a less than fair risk-adjusted return.  
$\star$  Indicates a high probability of undesirable risk-adjusted returns from the current market price over a multiyear time frame, based on our analysis. The market is pricing in an excessively optimistic outlook, limiting upside potential and leaving the investor exposed to Capital loss.

# Research Methodology for Valuing Companies

# Other Definitions

Last Price: Price of the stock as of the close of the market of the last trading day before date of the report.

Stewardship Rating: Represents our assessment of management's stewardship of shareholder capital, with particular emphasis on capital allocation decisions. Analysts consider companies' investment strategy and valuation, financial leverage, dividend and share buyback policies, execution, compensation, related party transactions, and accounting practices. Corporate governance practices are only considered if they've had a demonstrated impact on shareholder value. Analysts assign one of three ratings: "Exemplary," "Standard," and "Poor." Analysts judge stewardship from an equity holder's perspective. Ratings are determined on an absolute basis. Most companies will receive a Standard rating, and this is the default rating in the absence of evidence that managers have made exceptionally strong or poor capital allocation decisions.

Quantitative Valuation: Using the below terms, intended to denote the relationship between the security's Last Price and Morningstar's quantitative fair value estimate for that security.

- Undervalued: Last Price is below Morningstar's quantitative fair value estimate.  
Fairly Valued: Last Price is in line with Morningstar's quantitative fair value estimate.  
Overvalued: Last Price is above Morningstar's quantitative fair value estimate.

# Risk Warning

Please note that investments in securities are subject to market and other risks and there is no assurance or guarantee that the intended investment objectives will be achieved. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. A security investment return and an investor's principal value will fluctuate so that, when redeemed, an investor's shares may be worth more or less than their original cost. A security's current investment performance may be lower or higher than the investment performance noted within the report. Morningstar's Uncertainty Rating serves as a useful data point with respect to sensitivity analysis of the assumptions used in our determining a fair value price.
