# Netflix: Valuing a New Business Model

Since its 1997 founding, Netflix had built a reputation for innovation and a \$3.2 billion business by offering film rentals on DVD discs through the mail. In 2007, Netflix expanded into streaming media, the instantaneous delivery of media to computers, set-top boxes, and mobile devices via a broadband Internet connection.<sup>1</sup> By 2011, the company was pursuing streaming as its core business. Underlying this change in business model was Netflix CEO Reed Hastings' belief that streaming video offered the potential for more future growth than DVD rentals. Hastings had been hopeful about the future of streaming for at least a decade, commenting as early as 2001 that the company hoped to offer streaming services in the future.<sup>2</sup> The shift to streaming created several new wrinkles for Netflix, including questions about content acquisition, business segmentation, plan pricing, and accounting.

Analysts offered mixed assessments of Netflix's viability as a company focused on streaming media. Some argued that the company's massive subscriber base, customer loyalty, and existing relationships with the companies that controlled content would allow Netflix to succeed.<sup>3</sup> Others, though, pointed out the business weaknesses that were emerging as Netflix began focusing more on streaming media, and were concerned about high levels of stock sales by company management.<sup>4</sup>

In July 2011, Netflix announced the largest price increase in its history, and in September, Netflix decided to divide its DVD and streaming operations into two separate, independent companies; as a result of these announcements, the company's stock lost more than half its value, and almost a million subscribers canceled their subscriptions within a matter of weeks. (Exhibit 1 shows Netflix's stock performance. Exhibit 2 shows quarterly subscriber growth.)

At the same time, Netflix was engaged in international expansion. In 2010, Netflix debuted streaming service (but no DVDs) in Canada, and in 2011, streaming video became available in 43 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Netflix planned to begin streaming operations in the U.K. and Ireland in 2012, further distancing itself from the rental DVD business that had made it famous. Moving into the streaming video business, however, meant a transition from variable costs to fixed costs for content. The new business was difficult for investors and analysts to evaluate because of its newness and the different accounting rules that applied to streaming content. Many analysts fretted that Netflix's continued success was in doubt.[6]

# An Industry in Transition

The 2000s was a decade of transition for the home video rental industry, spearheaded by Netflix.

Between 2006 and 2011, the \(6 billion physical DVD rental industry shrank at a \(10 \%\)annual rate, and was expected to continue to decline at a \(13 \%\)annual rate from 2011 to 2016 as consumers rapidly adopted streaming video services and downloaded media.\(7\)

Before the entrance of Netflix, the industry had been dominated by Blockbuster and other brick-and-mortar chains of video rental stores. These stores carried a limited selection of videos with a heavy emphasis on new releases. They typically charged  $3 to$ 4 per rental and imposed late fees if the video was not returned within a specified time period. Netflix's monthly subscription, no late-fee, DVD-by-mail model upended the industry and eventually drove Blockbuster and many independent video rental stores into bankruptcy, according to analysts. New competitors renting physical DVDs from automated kiosks also emerged in the decade. One was Coinstar's Redbox, which was founded in 2002, and offered $1 to $2 DVD rentals at 30,000 kiosks throughout the country by 2011. Many such kiosks were conveniently located in supermarkets and convenience stores.

By the end of the decade, though, more Netflix customers were choosing to stream media directly to their computers, set-top boxes, and other devices via the Internet than were renting DVDs, and the company was heavily focused on acquiring streaming content.

# Netflix, Inc.

Netflix was founded in 1997 after Hastings, a successful entrepreneur, found a rented copy of Apollo 13 in his closet and had to pay a  \$40 late fee on it. "I had misplaced the cassette. It was all my fault," Hastings explained. "I didn't want to tell my wife about it. And I said to myself, 'I'm going to compromise the integrity of my marriage over a late fee?' Later, on my way to the gym, I realized they [the gym] had a much better business model. You could pay\$ 30 or \$40 a month and work out as little or as much as you wanted."9

By 2000, Hastings had settled on a business model and launched Netflix. The company charged users a monthly subscription price for an unlimited number of rentals, with no late fees. Pricing was tiered based on how many DVDs a user had at any given time (i.e., having one DVD at a time cost less than having two DVDs at the same time). To use the Netflix service, users paid a monthly subscription fee via credit card, created a profile, set up a queue of movies they wanted to watch, and were mailed the DVDs via the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) when they reached the top of the queue. Netflix used the data generated from its subscriber base (more than one million accounts by 2003, more than 20 million by 2011) to create recommendations for every user. The recommendation engine reduced demand for new releases, which were traditionally the most popular to rent and typically the most expensive DVDs to buy, and drove demand for older or less heavily promoted movies. The company built a nationwide network of processing centers that allowed for one-day DVD delivery to much of the U.S., and monitored users' queues to make shipping more efficient. Netflix went public in 2002.[10] The company enjoyed steady subscriber growth through the decade as it added DVD and streaming content, fueling what Hastings described as a virtuous cycle of more subscribers creating more revenue, which allowed for more content purchases.[11]

Headquartered in Los Gatos, California, Netflix employed more than 2,000 people worldwide in 2011, most of whom worked at its various U.S. DVD distribution facilities. Netflix boasted more than 20 million subscribers worldwide, the vast majority of whom were in the U.S. The company generated  \$3.2 billion in revenue in 2011, up \(48\%$  from 2010. (See Exhibits 3a through 3c for 2002-2011 financials.) Average monthly revenue per subscriber was \)11.84, down  $3\%$  from 2010. In July 2011, Netflix began requiring U.S. subscribers to subscribe separately to the streaming and DVD-by-mail segments of the business. After the addition of streaming services in 2007 and the international expansions of 2010 and

2011, Netflix began operating in three business segments: domestic streaming, international streaming, and (domestic) DVDs by mail.

# DVDs-by-Mail Business

Despite the decline in the market for DVD rentals, Netflix and its major competitors, Redbox and Blockbuster (bought by DISH Network after its 2011 bankruptcy), still found customers who were attracted to the physical media, and the companies continued to invest in DVD-content acquisition.[12]

Netflix began amassing its library of DVDs without any direct relationships to movie studios, instead relying on DVD distribution companies to acquire new content with minimal discounts. Beginning in 2000, Netflix transitioned to revenue-sharing agreements with movie studios. Studios reduced the up-front price per unit to Netflix in exchange for a fee based on the number of times a title was rented. Hastings explained, "We spent more money, not less, with the studios but got bigger customer satisfaction. It was like paying  $20\%$  more and getting two times the number of copies."13

Regardless of where the company got its DVDs, building a business around physical DVD rentals was simpler than with streaming content. Hastings explained the important difference between streaming content and DVDs: "U.S. laws enable anyone to buy a DVD and rent it [to others] as many times as they want. We can go to Wal-Mart, buy DVDs, and place them in our rental library. We don't need a license from the content owner to do so. Online content doesn't work like that. You have to negotiate the distribution rights with the studios."14 The law allowing the rental of physical DVDs without requiring permission from the copyright holder was known as the "First Sale Doctrine"; it was established by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1908.

Accounting for DVDs Netflix accounted for DVDs as a long term asset that was amortized over a one-to threeyear period on its balance sheet. The DVDs were amortized on a "sum-of-th-months" accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives. The company estimated that the useful life of a new release DVD was one year, while the useful life of a back-catalog DVD was three years. The useful life of the DVD was determined by a combination of customer interest and the durability of the actual physical disc.

# Streaming Video Business

The company acquired streaming content through licensing agreements with movie studios, TV networks, and other distribution companies. Separate distribution deals were negotiated to make content available on a range of Internet-connected devices such as PCs, smartphones, tablets, video game systems (e.g., Microsoft's Xbox, Nintendo's Wii, and Sony's PlayStation), set-top boxes that were either provided by cable TV providers or bought by consumers (e.g., Apple TV or Roku), and Internet-enabled TVs, DVD players, and Blu-ray players. Deals for streaming content could entail the rights to a single film, a TV series, or a suite of past, current, and/or future output from a movie studio or TV channel. Deals for streaming content, especially for feature films, were made more costly and complicated by the fact that most content creators (film studios in the case of feature films) had already sold the rights to distribute their content for many years to premium television channels, which saw Netflix as a growing competitor. Netflix, therefore, had to negotiate with these premium channels for their content distribution rights. The streaming content contracts that Netflix had recently negotiated were fixed-length, fixed-price deals, rather than revenue-sharing agreements. In these arrangements, the owners of content potentially made less money, but did not bear the risks involved with Netflix losing subscribers.

Despite the complicated, expensive deals for streaming content, Hastings viewed streaming as the

future of the industry, remarking in 2007, "We named the company Netflix [a name that combined the Internet and "flicks"-a slang term for movies] for a reason; we didn't name it DVDs-by-mail."15 He understood that offering streaming content to customers was a different business proposition than DVDs-by-mail because of its increased content acquisition costs.16 In addition, some analysts feared that Internet service providers (ISPs) would begin to target Netflix because the company's streaming video services would clog ISPs' networks. In autumn 2011, for example, Netflix's streaming services accounted for almost  $33\%$  of peak hours Internet bandwidth used globally.17

Accounting for streaming content To account for streaming content, Netflix used the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) standard 63 (FAS 63). This standard specified that broadcasters should account for a license agreement as the purchase of rights. Three criteria had to be fulfilled in order for the rights to broadcast content to be considered an asset:18

1. the cost of each title had to be known or reasonably determinable,  
2. the title (or the source file in the case of digital content) must have been received by the broadcaster, and  
3. the title had to be available for its first showing.

If content met all three criteria, FAS 63 stipulated that it should be recognized on the balance sheet and the income statement. On the balance sheet the total value of the licensed titles would be recorded as assets in the content library, and the total unpaid value of the licensed titles would be recorded as a liability (called content account payable) if it was due in less than one year, or as other non-current content liabilities if it was due in one year or later. On the income statement, companies had the choice of amortization method used (e.g., straight-line or accelerated) but were encouraged to use a method that reflected expected usage.

If content did not meet all three FAS 63 criteria, it would not be recorded as an asset on the balance sheet unless a prepayment had been made. On the income statement, the pre-paid asset would be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement, and the amortization expense would be recorded in the cost of subscription.

# Subscribers

Netflix's U.S. subscriber base of more than 20 million had steadily grown throughout the company's history. However, subscription cancellations were a major issue for the company. The subscriber mix from one month to the next could be very different. One analyst estimated that annual subscriber churn approached  $45\%$ .[19] Unsubscribing from Netflix was easy. Customers paid for their subscriptions on a monthly basis, unlike a magazine subscription which was typically prepaid for a year or more. When a user unsubscribed from Netflix, his or her account details and queue of upcoming movies or TV shows to watch were saved, making it easy to unsubscribe and resubscribe later. Netflix offered the first month of service free to all new users, so users could potentially unsubscribe and resubscribe with a different email address, street address, or credit card number and get multiple months of service free of charge.

The company understood the importance of its large subscriber base. Netflix could leverage its subscribers to compel movie studios and TV networks to agree to content deals, and could finance those deals with the consistent monthly payments of its subscribers. The company noted, "If our efforts to satisfy our existing subscribers are not successful, we may not be able to attract subscribers, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected."20

# Competitors

Netflix's main competitors in DVDrental operated in two different business models, rental kiosks and rental stores, while its streaming competitors used several business models.

DVD competitors Redbox operated DVD rental kiosks throughout the U.S. The company charged \(1 per rental per day in most locations, although prices varied for Blu-ray movies or video games. Users were required to use a credit or debit card to rent their movie, and the company automatically charged late fees for rentals that were not returned on time.[21] Blockbuster operated about 2,500 stores worldwide in 2011, about half of which were located outside the U.S. The company also offered DVDs-by-mail, streaming video service, and DVD-renal kiosks.[22]

Ad-supported streaming video Companies including CBS, Hulu (a joint venture between NBC Universal, News Corp., and Disney), YouTube (owned by Google), and other television networks offered advertising-supported streaming video content. The amount and quality of content on these ad-supported sites varied, from the hundreds of millions of hours of user-generated content on YouTube to the range of current and past CBS shows on CBS.com, to the variety of TV shows and movies available on Hulu. These websites were free to use and did not require subscriptions; however, some ad-supported sites required users to create a profile and verify their age before they could watch more-mature content. In addition, the range of content could change without notice, and access to back-catalog programming could be limited.

Digital stores Netflix faced competition from online stores that allowed customers to buy and instantly download digital copies of video files. These stores included Amazon.com, Apple's iTunes store, and others that priced digital content at similar rates to physical DVDs. To use these digital stores, users generally were required to create an account and link it to a credit card. These digital stores sometimes put a limit on the number of times content could be viewed or the time window in which user could view the content.

Subscription services Netflix competed against two different types of subscription-based services. The first was made up of sites such as Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus, and others that offered users access to a library of streaming content assembled through deals with movie studios, TV networks, and film distribution companies. Neither of these companies' subscription-based plans was self-sustaining in 2011, though. Hulu Plus was still supplemented with ads, and gave customers access to a wider variety of programming than Hulu's free offering. Much of Hulu Plus's programming had at one time been available for free on Hulu. Amazon Prime's streaming video service was offered as a free add-on to the Amazon Prime free-shipping service.

TV Everywhere Netflix considered subscription-based services known as TV Everywhere to be its major competition.[23] Companies such as HBO (owned by Time Warner), with its HBO Go service, and Showtime (owned by CBS), with Showtime Anytime, offered individuals who subscribed to their premium cable channels access to content on computers, smartphones, tablets, and other Internet-enabled devices. These cable channels already had access to content through their prior deals with movie studios and their own popular TV shows, such as HBO's Sex and the City or Showtime's Weeds. These networks, however, did not allow customers to sign up for streaming-only options, instead requiring them to pay for a cable-TV package that included the premium channel.

# Analyst Reactions

Analysts offered mixed reactions to Netflix's shift from a DVD-focused to a streaming-focused

company. They understood the rapid transition from physical to digital in all forms of media, and knew that Netflix had little choice but to embrace streaming. Some analysts raised issues with Netflix's business model that they believed could make it difficult for the company to succeed, while others came to the company's defense.

Accounting Before it began investing heavily in streaming content in 2010, Netflix bought its DVDs on a month-to-month basis and amortized them over a oneto three-year period, resulting in about  $40\%$  amortization of assets each quarter.[24] Once it began investing in streaming content, its costs to acquire assets became larger: threeto five-year contracts that posed high up-front costs. These assets were amortized over the life of the streaming contract, rather than the useful life of an individual film or TV title. By the second quarter of 2011, Netflix's quarterly amortization of its content had dropped to about  $24\%$ .[25] Analysts questioned the validity of amortizing the same film over a longer time period based on it being in streaming format rather than a physical DVD. One analyst noted, "This dynamic has eroded the quality of Netflix's earnings and has led to a large disparity between its cash flow and accrual earnings."[26] Other analysts defended Netflix's accounting practices, however. One analyst thought that Netflix's accounting, "could be viewed as conservative… . We expect healthy subscriber growth over time and by amortizing the content on straight-line basis, Netflix is actually initially amortizing the costs of a lower subscriber base and ultimately lower revenue base (assuming subscribers continue to grow).[27]\n\n

Off-balance-sheet obligations Analysts also worried about the amount of streaming content commitments that Netflix did not list on its balance sheet because they did not fall under FAS 63. Some were concerned that Netflix would not have enough future revenue to pay for its streaming content commitments when they came due.[28] (Exhibit 4 shows Netflix's content library and liabilities, Exhibit 5 shows the company's off-balance-sheet commitments, and Exhibit 6 shows the growth in Netflix's content acquisition costs.) As Netflix noted in its SEC filings, however, its off-balance-sheet obligations could be much higher than those currently acknowledged: "The company has entered into certain license agreements … It is unknown whether the company will receive access to these titles or what the ultimate price per title will be. Accordingly such amounts are not reflected … However such amounts are expected to be significant."[29] Analysts defended Netflix's methods, however, claiming they were similar to those used by other media companies.[30]

Financing growth Netflix's accounts payable were growing at a rapid rate, as it used trade credit to pay for the bulk of its large streaming content deals (see Exhibit 7 for growth in accounts payable). As one analyst noted in June 2011, "Days payable outstanding has gone from 35 days a year ago to 72 days as of last quarter, and is now at a level not seen since 2002." Some analysts worried that Netflix would struggle to pay its obligations, especially as it began expanding overseas. If Netflix's subscriber numbers started to decline or its content grew stale because it could not strike deals with the content owners who saw it as a competitor, it could enter into a downward spiral. Others, though, believed that Netflix's heretofore steady subscriber growth would continue to provide the company with enough liquidity.

Economies of scale A point of agreement among analysts was the potential for Netflix to leverage economies of scale in its streaming business that were absent from its DVD business because of the revenue-sharing agreements for acquiring DVD content. Because the company's streaming content was paid for in fixed-price contracts, its website and video streaming infrastructure had been in place for years, and the incremental cost of adding additional customers was small, analysts hoped that Netflix could achieve economies of scale. One analyst believed, however, that if the streaming business were to succeed, streaming content owners could push for revenue-sharing deals in the future, noting that some streaming deals were already based on revenue sharing.[32]

Insider sales A final point that concerned some analysts was the high level of insider stock sales. Noting that Hastings had been selling about 5,000 shares each week for the last several months, and several other C-level executives had also been actively selling their stock, one analyst questioned what they thought about their business.[33]

# The Strategic Shift

In November 2010, Netflix offered its first streaming-only subscription:  \$7.99/month for unlimited viewing. At this point, the most popular subscription offered by Netflix was\$ 9.99/month for an unlimited number of DVD rentals (with one DVD out at a time) and unlimited streaming. However, the company had already begun to view streaming as the core future business and, as one manager noted, "DVDs by mail was treated as a \$2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan."34

On July 12, 2011, with Netflix's stock trading at \(291/ share, the company announced a major change in subscription plans and pricing. Subscribers would no longer be able to combine DVD rentals and streaming video in one account. Users could subscribe to a DVD-only plan for \)7.99/month, a streaming-only plan for \$7.99/month or, if they wanted both features, they could sign up for both plans independently for their combined cost, \$15.98/month. This change amounted to a 60% price hike for those customers who wanted to continue to get DVDs and streaming video, which was previously offered for \)9.99/month. Customers were unhappy with the increase in price and many threatened to drop the service when the price change went into effect on September 1.[35] Netflix's stock started a swift decline, dropping about 3% per week for the next several weeks.

Despite customer complaints, Netflix kept its price change in place and moved one step further with an announcement on September 18 (as the company's stock was trading at \(143/share) of plans to rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as Qwikster. In a blog post,[36] Hastings described that the new service would be housed on an independent website and require customers to create new accounts on www.qwikster.com; the new service would not be integrated with Netflix's billing, recommendation, or queue systems. The company's streaming service would remain under the Netflix brand. In addition, Hastings announced that Qwikster would begin offering video game rentals, something Netflix had never done. Customers reacted to this announcement with more anger; almost 30,000 people commented on Hastings' blog post, many of whom announced their plans to cancel their subscriptions.[37]

On October 10, with a stock price of \$111 per share, just 22 days after announcing Qwikster, Hastings responded to the criticism with a simple statement: "no change: one website, one account, one password … in other words, no Qwikster."38 DVD rentals would stay at Netflix.

# What Should Netflix Order Next?

Would Netflix's recent subscriber losses in response to the price hike and Qwikster debacles continue, or turn around? Even if the subscriber losses turned around, would the company be able to generate enough revenue to pay for its current and future streaming commitments? In January 2012, all of these concerns were reflected by Netflix's stock, which was trading at its lowest level in 18 months; and investors and analysts now faced the challenge of valuing the new, streaming-focused company (see Exhibit 8 for analysts' price ranges).
