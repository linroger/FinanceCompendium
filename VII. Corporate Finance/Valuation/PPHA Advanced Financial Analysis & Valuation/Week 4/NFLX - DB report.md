# Positive On The Business, Cautious On The Stock, Netflix Sale Is Unlikely

Netflix has a long runway for growth due to its first mover advantage and self-reinforcing model. Increasing content and user experience (UX) investment drives subscriber growth and pricing power, which funds further content and UX investment. However, we see the risk/reward on the stock as unattractive. This is a very long duration, high multiple investment with market expectations that appear too high through 2020, when most analysts seem to be looking for valuation support. We are skeptical that Netflix will be acquired.

# Consensus Estimates Reflect An Optimistic Case With Downside Risk

Our EBIT estimates are lower than consensus every year through 2020, with higher expenses as the driver of the difference in 2017, and lower revenue increasingly the primary driver in 2018-2020. Our 2017-2020 cumulative EBIT forecast is  $27\%$  lower than consensus, while our EPS is  $32\%$  lower.

Netflix's Business Is Too Fully Formed/Valued To Be Acquired By Disney/Apple Lack of a compelling strategic rationale and severe economic/earnings dilution are major obstacles to a potential combination.  $25\%$  EPS Dilution for Disney.

Our Forecast Reflects A Very Successful Business Model Over The Long Term We forecast 200M subscribers in 2026 (83M today),  \$27B in revenue ($ 9B in 2016),  $8B in EBIT (\$ 0.2B in 2016), and 28% EBIT margin. This would put Netflix at the same size (based on EBIT) as TWX today. If the market values Netflix in 2026 at the same EBIT multiple as TWX today, it would imply a ~7% rate of return on NFLX's current stock price. While not the valuation methodology we use to derive our PT, we think it helps contextualize valuation.

# We Do Not Think Access To Content Is Becoming A Problem For Netflix

Netflix's pivot to original programming, the development of its own in-house studio, the growth in aggregate studio output, and the size of Netflix's programming budget all mitigate the apparent risk from Amazon, Hulu, and local international players increasing their SVOD programming spend.

# Is Competition An Increasing Risk? Netflix Is Winning So Far, Amazon Is A Risk

Netflix has become the must-have SVOD service in the US, it is a complement to pay TV for the vast majority of users, and internationally it has had success in markets where local TV incumbents have failed. Consequently, we think Netflix will continue to succeed given its constant re-investment into content and UX. Yet, we think Amazon is the key competitor to watch.

# Domestic Subscriber Growth Deceleration Underscores Need To Re-Invest

With penetration exceeding  $50\%$  of US broadband homes, the incremental subscriber is more difficult to attract. We see the incorporation of Netflix into cable and DBS STBs, as well as continued content and UX spend as drivers of continued subscriber growth, albeit at a decelerating rate.

# Valuation & Risks: Trades At 20x 2020 DB EBITDA, 14x Consensus

We value Netflix using our market-based DCF (12.5% WACC) and 10-year forecast. Upside risks: include greater subscribers and ARPU, a weaker US$, lower expenses, successful entry into China, and Netflix being acquired.

# Investment Thesis

# Outlook

Netflix has a long runway for growth due to its first mover advantage and self-reinforcing model. Increasing content and user experience (UX) investment drives subscriber growth and pricing power, which funds further content and UX investment. However, we see the risk/reward on the stock as unattractive. This is a very long duration, high multiple investment with market expectations that appear too high through 2020, when most analysts seem to be looking for valuation support. We are skeptical that Netflix will be acquired. SELL.

# Valuation

We use our economic returns model, a market-based DCF, to forecast future equity value which we then discount back, using our estimated  $12.5\%$  cost of equity, to a 1-year forward target. In Netflix's case, we've used an extended forecast period (through 2026). We begin by capitalizing the growth in unlevered free cash flow at the WACC  $(12.5\%)$ , adding the value creation to enterprise value. We then model the capital structure, including potential share count reduction through share repurchases, to derive a future per share equity value.

# Risks

Risks (to the upside) include: (1) Lower programming and other expenses than we've forecasted, (2) Greater subscriber and pricing growth than we've forecasted, particularly in international markets where the range of outcomes is much wider, (3) Successful entry into China, and (4) Netflix being acquired.

# Competitive Positioning

# We See Netflix As A Secular Winner

# One of the Few Companies in Media Where Fundamentals Are Improving

Netflix continues to effectively execute a successful strategy in the US, offering a better viewing experience than traditional Television, while also continuing its international expansion. Netflix's differentiated customer experience is rooted in its absence of advertising, the ability to binge watch entire seasons of shows, a simple user interface (UI) that facilitates content discovery through both search and recommendation, a near ubiquitous device/platform footprint, and a constant focus on continuously improving the user experience (including the content, user interface, network performance, and video resolution).

# Subscribers, Usage per Subscriber, and Domestic ARPU All Continue To Grow

The proof of the product's acceptance by the customer is obvious when looking at the KPIs over the last several years. Domestic subscriber growth remains impressive despite high penetration, and the pace of international growth is torrid. FX headwinds internationally and deliberate patience on pricing has kept international ARPU growth modest, but supportive of further subscriber growth. Subscriber engagement, as measured by hours streamed per day, has also grown nicely.

Approaching 2 hrs per day, Netflix per subscriber usage continues to grow impressively. We believe the stats are modestly inflated  $(\sim 8\%)$  by the degree of account sharing, which would equate to higher number of equivalent Pay-TV households

# Netflix's Business Model Is Self-Reinforcing

One can only admire Netflix's strategic gamesmanship in licensing syndicated content from US TV incumbents in order to build its user base to a point at which it had enough scale to begin commissioning its own original content; a move that was essential to establishing a sustainable competitive position. The continuous investment in expanding the available content, particularly original content, leads to growth in viewing per subscriber (driving pricing power and improved retention) and growth in subscribers. International expansion further supports the establishment of Netflix as a scaled player, allowing for increased originals investment with the international segment bearing a significant portion of the cost.

Scale vis-a-vis a large subscriber base, exclusive content and information asymmetry are Netflix's competitive advantages. Netflix can take more creative risk, has better information than the sellers of a show regarding a show's value, and it knows more about each subscriber than other aggregators due to the time spent on the platform. Furthermore, Netflix has a culture and focus on being great at what they do, but nothing else. A culture of continuous improvement has been the driving force behind the company.

# But, We Don't See SVOD As A Winner-Take-All Market

# Is Netflix An Aggregator (Network) or Platform (Distributor)? Does it matter?

In the historical Pay-TV context, Netflix is an aggregator, without question, since it and it alone decides what programs to procure/create and make available as part of its service. Furthermore, Netflix is increasingly being offered through other platforms alongside other aggregators. Such platforms include traditional Pay-TV operator STBs and internet platforms such as Amazon, Roku, and Apple TV.

Netflix is also a distributor in one sense because it has direct relationships with all of its subscribers, but it isn't a distributor in another (historical Pay-TV) sense because other aggregators are not available on Netflix.

Some argue that Netflix is becoming a platform (like cable TV) and this is important because it means people are going to Netflix to "see what's on" as opposed to going to NFLX for a given show. While there's some truth to this statement, particularly in certain market segments, we don't see this as a bright line between NFLX and other aggregators (i.e. broadcast and cable networks) in this regard. People do go to CBS, Discovery Channel, ESPN, and HGTV (to name a few) linear channels and their on-demand menus to find something to watch. Does that mean that all of these aggregators are platforms? We don't think so. It means they are all branded aggregators. Strong content feeds aggregator brands and strong brands drive viewers to content, creating a virtuous circle - like we're seeing with Netflix. We do, however, see a grey area in this regard, where Netflix is more of a platform than these other aggregators because its greater scale in content gives users reason to spend more time viewing Netflix relative to other aggregators; and Netflix does have its own user interface that fosters greater viewer captivity.

# Fragmentation Is Both Friend And Foe To Netflix

The well organized historical model of distributors paying aggregators for carriage and then organizing the content into channels and menus through their UIs is changing. In the past, consumers went to a central place for

content search and discovery. Consumers are now going to multiple places for content search, discovery, and consumption. While we believe consumers would still prefer a central interface for all TV search and discovery, it doesn't exist and the desire for specific content and different forms of viewing (on-demand, ad-free, consumable on any screen) are overcoming the desire for centralization.

Two important conclusions can be drawn from the existence of a diversity of consumer tastes, a very abundant supply of high quality programming, and an inability for any single company to capture sufficient industry revenue to corner the market for content. First, we think it means that Netflix should continue to grow its business and have a sustainable position in the market. Second, we think it means that this is not a winner-take-all market.

# Competition From Well Capitalized Players Is Intensifying

Over the past two years, we've seen a reinvigoration of Hulu's SVOD service with increased programming investment, an aggressive ramp up in content investment by Amazon, more full season stacking rights secured by traditional TV networks, the re-launch and expansion of live streaming bundles from Sony and DISH, the launch of direct-to-consumer offerings from traditional networks, the announcement of new streamed pay TV services to be introduced by Hulu and DIRECTV over the next several months, and Google's YouTube Red service beginning to make some noise.

# Consumers Want Choice & Breadth

We think the vast majority of consumers will continue to want a mix of live and on-demand content, and will source content from multiple aggregators and platforms. Content companies will be judicious about how and when they window their content. As a result, we think a bundle (maybe not "The Bundle" in all cases) will continue to exist in some form. Traditional distributors, therefore, continue to have an opportunity to add value. New distributors, the likes of Amazon Firestick, Apple, Roku, etc. also have an opportunity to create platforms that integrate the best of TV content. Platforms like Comcast's X1 or Charter's Spectrum Guide also have an opportunity to host 'new aggregators' like Netflix on their platforms.

# Our View On The Stock

# An Unquestionably Strong Growth Story, But A Valuation That Is Ahead Of The Fundamentals

# Netflix's Strategy Is To Aggressively Reinvest in Content To Drive Subscriber Growth And Achieve A Sustainable Leadership Position In The Market

We think that Netflix will need to continue to invest aggressively in content in order to sustain its desired growth trajectory, achieve a global position of scale, and meet the unique challenges posed by the company's international expansion. We believe that this means the timing and scale of profitability is further away than many believe. Consensus profit estimates, in our view, are too high by a significant degree. Our EBIT estimates are  $27\%$  lower than the consensus mean for 2017-2020, on a cumulative basis, and  $23\%$  lower in 2020.

# While Netflix Has Already Become A Force In Hollywood, It Does Not Yet Represent An Outsized Percentage Of Television Programming Costs

Based on research from John Landgraf's team at FX Networks, 2016 is on pace for about 440 original scripted series in 2016, up  $5\%$  from what he previously called "Peak TV" in 2015. Netflix's 31 scripted originals, which exclude Kids content, represents  $7.5\%$  of total production. Based on content spend by the companies under our coverage, we estimate that the industry aggregators spend approximately  $46\%$  of revenues on programming. Applying that figure to our industry estimate for advertising and affiliate revenue, and backing out sports rights costs, we estimate Netflix's  $\$2.4B$  in domestic content spend represents slightly over  $6\%$  industry television programming costs. If we include the contribution from other SVOD players (most notably Amazon, Hulk & YouTube), we estimate Netflix represents just over  $5\%$  of industry spend on content.

# We See Our Programming Expense Forecast As Reasonable, Rather Than Conservative

Management has bold ambitions for both global expansion and continued growth in the US. While we see the favorable US dynamics as already in place and well understood by the market, we think the international opportunity is a very long game and will require more investment than the market is anticipating. We also think the rate of international subscriber growth might be slower than the market is expecting given that Netflix has only begun to invest in most markets. In short, we see challenges in the international segment that could take longer and cost more to overcome than the market is anticipating. We discuss this in more detail in the International section of this report. Lastly, achieving management's 60-90M long term domestic subscriber target will require continued growth in programming costs, which we think the market might also be underestimating. Continued programming investment is the key to growing the subscriber base and driving pricing power.

# Our Forecast Is Consistent With Some Of Management's Commentary On The Multi-Year Programming Expense Outlook

Management has articulated a long term target of a 50/50 mix between licensed and original content, but has indicated that even the licensed portion will grow. Our forecast achieves this approximately 50/50 mix in 2018, with all of the worldwide licensing expense growth in the International segment in order to drive growth. US licensing remains flat through 2020, with all US programming expense growth driven by originals. Originals also grow within International; we allocate  $57\%$  of all global original content to International and  $43\%$  to domestic.

Management commented in early 2016 that it wants to increase average subscriber engagements with originals from once per month to once per week. Looking at this through the lens of simple math, it implies that management intends to increase original programming by four times in the US from 2015. This is also embedded in our US forecast. Applying the US vs international allocation methodology (we assume  $43\%$  US) then yields the international portion of global originals expense.

# We Expect Decreasing Returns On Incremental Programming Expense

Our forecast assumes that every incremental dollar of programming expense yields less subscriber growth now that penetration in the US exceeds  $50\%$  and the initial cream-skimming in many international markets will be over soon. Looking at programming expense on a per subscriber per month basis, we forecast the US to go from  $3.87 in 2015 to$ 4.84 in 2020, a  $4.6\%$  CAGR. It seems logical to us that the incremental domestic subscriber will be more difficult to attract/retain as compared to the first 45M and therefore, programming expense per subscriber will trend higher. On the international side, we view Netflix's content investment and current global push to result in per subscriber growth this year, but subscriber growth will reverse the unit costs, modestly over the next several years. We see per subscriber programming costs declining to \$5.44 in 2020 (down  $1.1\%$  annually from 2015's \$5.75).

# We Estimate The Stock Price Is 2 Years Ahead of the Fundamentals

We arrive at our 12-month PT by using our market based DCF model, which looks at the returns to equity implied by our forecast based on the company's current valuation. We estimate that based on our forecast, at the current stock price, Netflix will return a  $10\%$  compounded annual rate of return to equity holders over the next 10 years. We think investors' required rate of return on Netflix is higher than  $10\%$ . We assume a  $12.5\%$  cost of equity.

We believe the major point of differentiation between our valuation for Netflix and the market's is the company's medium to long term margin structure. Sell-side consensus estimates imply a P/E multiple of about 23x 2020 EPS based on today's stock price, while our earnings forecast implies 31x 2020 EPS. Our model assumes that Netflix will turn FCF positive in 2020, while consensus appears to assume the company will generate positive FCF in 2018.

# Our PT Values The US At  \$40/share and International At\$ 50/share

The range of outcomes is much wider for the international business than it is for the US. Consequently, we wanted to estimate the value of the US business on a standalone basis. This requires making some assumptions about shared costs (G&A and Technology). Our US-only model assumes that the vast majority of current shared costs are attributed to the domestic business, while a bit more than half of the growth in shared costs is allocated to international. It assumes the same level of domestic programming expense, although in reality the absence of an international business would increase domestic programming costs because originals could not be allocated to both segments. That said, if Netflix were only a US business, it would be able to license its original programming internationally, offsetting the higher domestic programming expense with licensing revenue. This, however, would require some investment into establishing a licensing infrastructure.

One can see from the models below that both the US and the International business, which naturally trade at high multiples/low yields today, grow into more reasonable valuation multiples toward the end of our ten-year forecast period, valuation ranges that are appropriate for company in its more advanced stages of growth.

# An Acquisition By Disney or Apple Is Unlikely

In our opinion, Netflix's business model is too fully formed and well understood by the market to be acquired by Disney or Apple, as mentioned in recent press articles (Barron's). Acquisition targets for these companies, ideally, are those that bring unique capabilities, IP, or technology that are more valuable when leveraged by these bigger companies' capabilities in their core businesses. Companies with unique technology, IP, or other capabilities, but without strong business models, are ideal targets because of the financial upside that is not reflected in their standalone market valuations. However, Netflix has a fully formed business model that is richly valued in the market, making it very hard for a strategic acquirer to acquire Netflix and earn its cost of capital on the purchase. It seems to us that if Disney or Apple acquired Netflix and used it for the betterment of its core business, then it would be value destructive to Netflix's core business value, requiring the acquirer to

create more value somewhere else than is destroyed in Netflix's core business, a very tall order. Furthermore, the economic and earnings dilution would be severe in the case of Disney.

# Apple

In order for Apple (covered by DB Analyst Sherri Scribner) to create value in its core business from Netflix, Apple would have to degrade the Netflix experience (or fail to innovate the experience) on all non-Apple hardware/software platforms, something that would clearly diminish Netflix's core business value as a hardware neutral service. This makes structuring a economically accretive deal challenging for Apple. If Apple were to acquire Netflix, it would be the company's largest acquisition ever.

# A Deal Would Be Very Dilutive For Disney Shareholders (25% EPS Dilution)

Netflix would, naturally, provide a new source of earnings growth for Disney, but with Netflix trading north of 100x 2018 earnings, the dilution would be  $\sim 25\%$  even through F2021. Culturally, we also find it hard to see how Netflix could be successfully integrated into Disney. Our analysis, which assumes a  \$130 per share M&A take out, 50/50 cash/equity and an incremental\$ 200M in run-rate corporate cost synergies, results in a pro forma DIS EPS  $25\%$  below our stand-alone DIS estimates. The deal would also leave DIS levered at 2.5x Net Debt / PF '17 EBITDA, significantly higher than the sub 1x we see today.

The Defensive Angle Doesn't Make Sense For Disney, Non-ESPN TV Operating Income Is Only  $\sim 17\%$  of the DIS Total.

Disney's core TV challenge is ESPN's maturity - declining subscribers, a high wholesale price point, and (to a lesser extent) Sports Center's format becoming less relevant in the digital age. We don't see how Netflix would resolve any of these challenges as a non-sports, ad-free service that sits outside of the pay TV ecosystem. Disney couldn't realistically marry ESPN with Netflix's service - it would make Netflix too expensive, driving high churn because an estimated  $85\%$  of Netflix subscribers already have ESPN through their pay TV subscription. Consumers certainly won't pay for ESPN twice, they would just drop their Netflix subscriptions; not their pay TV subscriptions because they need all the other networks on pay TV that carry sports if they are indeed sports fans. If they are not sports fans, then they won't pay more for Netflix because ESPN has been added, causing them to churn.

The arguments for synergies between Disney and Netflix are not compelling, in our view.

1. There's no meaningful synergies with Disney's production business. The studio already makes films and licenses the TV window for Disney films to Netflix for a few hundred million dollars per year (only about  $5\%$  of Netflix's programming budget in 2017). The monetization would be the same if Disney went to other TV/SVOD outlets, which demonstrates how little value exists within that window for movies.  
2. On the TV production side, Disney already produces shows for and licenses content to Netflix. The studio is not having a problem selling its shows into a robust competitive market that includes traditional networks, as well as Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu. Nor is Netflix having a problem sourcing shows from studios, including Disney. TV production is sufficiently fragmented that there are ample buyers for Netflix to utilize. In fact, the only way for Netflix to continue growing is to source content from many studios because maintaining the diversity of programming is essential to building on what is already a very high penetration level; it is also necessary to increase pricing power. Netflix actually has more content on its balance sheet right now than Disney, and it is growing. Due to the fragmentation of production, there's little in the way of cost synergies because studios deal with their vertically integrated programming assets (whether it is Netflix, a traditional network, or Hulu) on an arm's length basis, licensing shows to the highest bidder. Netflix is licensing shows from everyone. In addition, Netflix is building its own production studio inside of Netflix. Netflix is already a first stop for most new projects; thus Disney would only enhance Netflix's access to content marginally.  
3. Other cost synergies would have to be balanced against maintaining the culture of innovation, focus, and continuous improvement that exists at Netflix today. We believe that Netflix, if acquired by Disney, would have to be run as an autonomous business unit in order to preserve these vital cultural elements that have driven the company's success to date. The only area where there would be any cost synergies, in our estimation, would be in G&A. Netflix's G&A, in total, we estimate is about \$550M in 2016. We think the G&A cost synergies would be limited to maybe \$100M or so given the need to run Netflix autonomously.

# The Offensive Argument For A Disney Deal

The only reason we can see for Disney seriously considering acquiring Netflix is the international growth opportunity. To be clear, however, this an opportunity that Netflix is already executing on and is reflected in the stock price. Disney has dabbled in international OTT with its Disney Life service (UK, China), but otherwise is not pursuing anything at scale in international OTT. Disney could be interested in Netflix because it sees an even bigger international opportunity than is priced into Netflix's shares today. Disney has extensive experience operating internationally, which could benefit Netflix's global growth. All of that said, the strategic rationale for putting Disney and Netflix together is not all that compelling.

# The Other "FANGs" Have Greater Near To Medium Term Valuation Support, Greater Optionality, And Have Fundamentally Different Opportunities

We see Netflix as a subscription-based, direct-to-consumer programmer, a company more similar to other content aggregators and distributors in the traditional media sector. However, we recognize that many investors like to put Netflix in the same category as Amazon, Facebook, and Google; completing the FANG acronym. Therefore, we provide our perspective here on the relative comparison of the other FANG stocks to Netflix. Ross Sandler covers FB, AMZN, and GOOG for Deutsche Bank.

The exhibit below compares valuation multiples and relative performance across the FANG stocks. In addition to the other FANGs having more near to medium term valuation support, we also believe there are fundamental differences in their respective global opportunities, and differences in their option value related to value creation in non-core, but related businesses (e.g. AWS and shipping for Amazon, autonomous vehicles for Google).

The market's bull case for Netflix is that it can become to Internet-delivered TV what Google is to Search and short-form video, and what Facebook is to Social Media. We've also heard investors frame Netflix as analogue to Amazon; a multi-decade growth story that can funnel cash flow back into the business, delaying profitability all while expanding its TAM (i.e. an envelop strategy). While we do think this is consistent with management's long-term plan, we see them as structurally different opportunities. Google and Facebook are better businesses. They are open platforms with scaled user bases and, therefore, significant network effects and no content costs. This makes them natural monopolies in many ways. Their services are free to end-users and can be used even in very low bandwidth environments, resulting in a larger TAM and much higher natural penetration levels. Both also benefit from virtuous cycles whereby the more people use the service, the better the service becomes for others. Netflix's addressable market, International broadband households, is only at 590M, projected to increase to 800M by 2020 (including China, in which entry is highly uncertain) while Google's and Facebook's addressable market, the global mobile phone user base, is estimated at 3.8B, increasing to 4.6B by 2020. Furthermore, because Google and Facebook don't actually provide the content on their platforms, they are not limited by the need to invest in local content in order to drive penetrations deeper, whereas Netflix will have this constraint. Netflix's global pricing strategy is also limiting given income levels and propensity to spend on content, as well as other factors in many markets, which we discuss in more detail in the International section.

Amazon's opportunity, setting aside its AWS business and international retail operations, is  \$4.8T in the US (essentially the entire retail industry). In contrast, we estimate the entire US Pay-TV industry generates\$ 100B in subscription revenue annually. Amazon's core retail business also has much more fragmentation in the supplier base. While there is fragmentation in the studios and talent that ultimately supply Netflix content, the major studios and media conglomerates play a major role and compete with Netflix.

The scale in technology research & development is also a differentiator. Google, Amazon, and Facebook employee large armies of engineers working on a wide range of technologies and applications. They are also touching massive numbers of consumers and processing massive amounts of information. This scale naturally leads to new opportunities in areas that can enhance the core business, or create new standalone opportunities that don't necessarily relate to the core.

At the end of the day, we see comparisons to Google, Facebook or Amazon as largely irrelevant in thinking about Netflix.

# International Segment

# International Is A Long Term Growth Opportunity That Requires Investment and Patience

# Global TAM Appears Huge, But Penetration Will Vary By Country and There Are Significant Obstacles

We believe that Netflix's international operations will see significant subscriber growth in the coming years. However, as management has alluded to, they've only begun their work on the international opportunity. Netflix needs to invest in more original content, local content, marketing, language translation, and technology. Even with focus and investment, there are significant challenges. The cream skimming strategy of penetrating the part of the addressable market who speaks English, likes Hollywood content, has high disposable income, is used to paying for content, and has broadband shouldn't be too difficult for Netflix. However, replicating Netflix's high penetrations in the US and other English-speaking, high-GDP per capita countries is a much tougher proposition. We discuss and analyze some of the key challenges for Netflix as it attempts to penetrate more international markets.

# International Broadband Homes: 630M (430M Ex-China) Today, Increasing To 1B (700M Ex-China) in 2024

While it is indeed a big world, the broadband-connected world isn't as large one might think. While broadband availability and penetration continue to grow worldwide, much of the world's population will only access the internet through mobile connections. Thus, the mobile connected world is much larger than the broadband connected world. However, mobile bandwidth is generally too limited or expensive for streaming large amounts of video.

The first filter in assessing the market opportunity outside of the US for Netflix is simply the number of households who have access to broadband internet capability. It's true that mobile broadband could stand-in for wired access in a pinch, but we think it's unlikely that wireless technologies will be able to affordably deliver Netflix as the primary access technology. We estimate just more than 600M broadband homes outside of the US today, which should grow  $\sim 6\%$  per annum, to just over 1B broadband homes in 2024. Below, we categorize countries based on when Netflix first entered the market. We show India and China separately because of their size and unique dynamics. Netflix has not entered China, but has entered India, and we see entry into China as highly uncertain given the level of governmental restrictions and the high level of competition from large players.

# Language Is a Major Factor In Determining Penetration

There is some level of demand for Hollywood content in essentially every country worldwide. However, the appetite does vary, and we've observed, not surprisingly, that English-speaking countries have had the fastest Netflix adoption rates and achieved the highest penetration levels to date. Today,  $\sim 90\%$  of the catalog has been subtitled in approximately 21 languages, while  $\sim 80\%$  has been dubbed. More languages will also be added in the future; for example, versions in Indian languages, Russian, and African languages have not yet been included. The chart below compares the monthly adoption rates since inception for select markets to the prevalence of English speakers, multichannel penetration, and multichannel ARPU. English speaking countries, including Norway and Sweden, have had the fastest adoption rates.

# Taste in Content Is Also A Key Factor

Hollywood content is very exportable, but its popularity varies. In India, we think the appetite is small, with Hollywood representing only  $\sim 6\%$  of the film box office. In Germany ( $\sim 65\%$  English speakers), it is quite high; while not as strong in France, the UK, or Spain (as shown in the charts below).

# Competition: Netflix Is Not The First Mover In Many International Markets

Netflix will surely benefit from its experience in the US and earlier launched international markets. However, it has recently entered many markets where there is already one or more earlier entrants, most of which are backed by local TV incumbents with existing US content rights and their own original programming. Below are some examples of large markets with competitive services that Netflix is or will be competing against.

Germany: Maxdome is an £8/month advertising-free SVOD service with a catalog equivalent in size to Netflix. Maxdome comes pre-installed on TVs sold in Germany and the service offers Hollywood TV series and movies, as well as exclusive ProSieben free-to-air (FTA) content. Maxdome is owned by

ProSieben, one of the large TV incumbents. Amazon Prime, Watchever (owned by Vivendi), and Sky Online are also SVOD services operating in Germany.

India: EROS Now and Hot Star compete in India. EROS Now is owned by Eros, the largest Bollywood studio, which represents about 40% of the Indian box office. Eros Now is priced at ~\$0.75/month for basic and ~\$1.50 for the premium tier. EROS Now offers movies, TV, original series, and music. EROS Now also offers the capability to download content to one's device, which is particularly important in a country with an immature broadband infrastructure. Eros recently announced that the service passed 49M registered users, but only 1.1M actively paying subscribers even at a low price point and with content that has broad appeal in India. Another OTT service is Hotstar, which is owned by Star India, which is owned by Fox. Hotstar offers TV series, movies, and sports; and it is free. Pay TV ARPU in India averages \$2.50 per month, thus, Netflix is not price competitive with Pay-TV there. HBO, while it does not offer a direct-to-consumer service in India, earns about a \$0.14 ARPU in India.

China: The list of challenges associated with entering China is long, including that there are many competitors with substantial head starts, namely Tmall Box Office ("TBO", owned by Alibaba), whose model closely resembles Netflix's. In addition, there's Youku Tudou (owned by Alibaba), PPTV, iQiyi, PPS.tv, Sohu Video, LeTV, Tencent TV, M1905.com, Sina Video, CBox, and Funshion. China also requires SVOD services to have  $70\%$  of their content sourced from China. We think Netflix would need a partner to enter China successfully.

Other Europe: Canal Plus has launched Canal Play in France, Mediaset has launched Mediaset Premium in Italy, Sky offers TV Choice in the UK, and Amazon Prime operates in all of these markets.

# Propensity To Spend: Some Markets Are More Accustomed To Paying For Content Than Others

Netflix intends to maintain a global pricing strategy in which the US and international markets are priced at about the same level (note that there can still be variability because of tier mix and country-specific price increases). This can create some challenges in driving penetration deeper. While it is by no means a perfect indicator, we think that multichannel penetration and ARPU levels are instructive in assessing how successful individual markets might be over time. We think that non-English speaking markets with very low multichannel ARPUs - such as India, Russia, South Korea, China, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia - will see much lower adoption than markets with higher pay TV ARPUs (e.g. Western and Northern Europe, Latin America). Income levels are also an important factor in assessing long term penetration rates in developing countries.

We analyzed Basic Cable ARPU stats in many markets, e.g. the "Pre-2016 launch markets" and those that were announced after the 2016 CES (Rest Of World, ex. China). On a weighted average basis, we see a basic cable ARPU of more than  \$30 in the Pre-CES markets, compared to slightly over\$ 7 in the Post-CES markets. We believe this points to much lower penetrations in these more recently launched markets.

# Pre-2016 Markets Represent 118M, or  $29\%$ , of Worldwide Broadband Homes Ex-China

# North America's  $53\%$  Share of Global Multichannel Revenue Seems To Present A Significant Obstacle To Netflix Penetrating International Markets

Looking at the above through a different lens, in the first three waves of international launches (i.e. the pre-January 2016 launches), the average multichannel ARPU was greater than  \$25 in markets comprising \(79\%$  of broadband households. In contrast, markets with multichannel ARPU above \)25 in ROW (i.e. markets launched in January 2016) comprised only  $16\%$  of broadband households.

# Netflix's Content Rights Vary By Territory; The US Has The Best Selection

It's widely understood that Netflix's US catalog is broader and deeper than its international selection (which varies by country). In the charts below, we compare total quantity of content by market, in addition to showing the current overlap some key markets have with the US version of the service. Content moves in and out, of course and so this is a moving target. At least anecdotally, we found that even where there is not overlap between the US and respective international line-up, the vast majority of the content is Hollywood / Western content. Japan has a sizeable amount of unique/local content, which management has determined is necessary for success in Japan. Netflix has maintained that they plan on first leveraging the desire to consume Hollywood/Western content. However, the company plans to increase investment in local content over time in order to drive penetration deeper.

Figure 33: Comparison of Quantity of Content  
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/9cf0ab15-304d-4164-b091-0de1ada1b24e/511c7e985ee2b7fac91cb57f631b32a4c8ff5a06609945cd9959f2597ce70a5d.jpg)  
Source: Deutsche Bank, Netfixable.com (

We also looked at the proportion of content at the respective international versions that is available on the US version of Netflix to get a sense of the rough overlap. The proportion of international content that can be found under the US catalogue ranges from approximately  $30\%$  to  $65\%$ , with Japan on the low end and India on the high end.

# Piracy Levels Also Vary

Piracy is another factor in willingness to pay for content. Every market has piracy, some more than others. We observe that piracy is highest where there isn't affordable legal access to the content being sought. Therefore, the logic follows that in markets with high standards of living (e.g. Australia), piracy will decrease noticeably as the availability of legal content increases. However, in markets with low income levels (e.g. India) or significant government censorship (e.g. China), piracy rates are likely to be less impacted by Netflix

entry. Broadband access is also a factor, since one cannot download or file-share without access to the internet and adequate bandwidth. There probably is also a habit factor, as well. Those who have always pirated content such that it has become second nature for them will be less inclined to start paying for content. Lastly, the legal enforcement of IP protection also has to be a factor. Russia, China, Eastern Europe, parts of Latin America, and Southern Europe are generally viewed as the areas where piracy rates are highest.

# Regulatory Hurdles Exist, More Could Materialize

Media regulation, censorship, fee collection, and ownership concerns are fixtures of the global media landscape. Netflix flipped the switch to make Netflix's service available in 130 new countries in January 2016, including many of the least friendly regimes to foreign media organizations. China, for example, (which Netflix has not yet entered) has strict censorship rules and requires that at least  $70\%$  of an SVOD service's content is Chinese content. Issues could come up in the future if governments (or their constituents) become concerned that Netflix is hurting their domestic media industry or pushing the limits on censorship.

# Payment Infrastructure

Netflix's US model is based on credit card (or PayPal) billing. When the company initially began its international expansion, the natural question was how would countries with low credit card penetration pay? This is initially a limiting factor whenever Netflix enters a market with low credit card penetration. However, Netflix has managed through this by developing alternative methods of payment. For example, in Brazil, customers can pay with prepaid Visa and MasterCard cards, direct debit from bank accounts, Netflix Gift Cards, and iTunes, in addition to PayPal and credit cards. Debit cards, iTunes, and Netflix gift cards can also be used for payment in the US.

# Device Penetration

A barrier to subscription exists for households that do not have a Smart TV, OTT device, tablet, PC, smart phone, or STB UI that offers Netflix. In general, penetrations for these devices are lower than the US in most markets, but all are growing.

# Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):

In mid-January 2016 David Fullagar, VP of Content Delivery Architecture at Netflix, wrote a press release describing Netflix's use of proxy detection to deter subscribers from streaming content not available to them in their home markets. Content owners who sell content into specific markets clearly want Netflix to enforce, to the extent it can, geographic licensing boundaries. Prior to Netflix tightening its VPN enforcement tactics, it was well established that some users in certain international geographies were using VPNs to appear as if they were US subscribers to Netflix's servers. Our checks indicate that Netflix has beefed up its efforts in detecting users use of such VPNs. The implications of a more effective ban on VPNs are unclear. On one hand, we think this could present a near term headwind to international subscriber growth as some international subscribers, conditioned to having access to the full US content line-up, view the local version in a less favorable light. On the other hand, if Netflix truly has the ability to monitor the usage, then it perhaps enables a much more flexible global pricing strategy. One reason, among others, why Netflix has rolled out a fairly uniform global pricing structure, is that the use of VPNs could enable tech-savvy subscribers the ability to price arbitrage the service.

# Pre-2016 "Global Launch" Markets Should Be The Near Term Driver For Sub Growth

We think of Netflix's international opportunity as bifurcated into pre and post "Global Launch" markets; in other words, launched either before Netflix's January 2016 announcement or after. Markets like the Canada, UK, the Nordic region, and major Lat Am countries exhibit some of the strongest near term opportunities for Netflix to take advantage of the core value proposition that has proven so successful in the US. While we acknowledge the long tail opportunity in markets like India, Japan, et. al, we think driving penetration in the older markets will be the fundamental international growth engine in the near-medium term. In our 2017 international net add forecast, nearly  $60\%$  of our 11.4M forecast comes from the "1st wave" (Canada, UK, Nordic, LatAm, etc.) and  $\sim 85\%$  from Pre-Global Launch markets (i.e. First, Second, and Third Wave markets).

As we assessed Netflix's opportunity in the remaining global markets, we utilized His data on previously launched markets to develop a sense of adoption curves, keeping in mind differences in broadband penetration, Pay-TV ARPUs, and popularity of Hollywood content. We estimate that in the Rest of World (ROW ex. China, ex. India), Netflix can grow penetration to  $\sim 9\%$  by 2024. Given the growth in broadband homes, we think this area of the world can deliver nearly 23M subscribers by the end of 2024. On a weighted average basis, these markets currently have a  $36\%$  broadband penetration,  $44\%$  multichannel penetration, and a \$12 Pay-TV ARPU.

We used a similar approach for India. We think India presents some unique challenges given the popularity of local content and the lack of broadband infrastructure. We estimate India has  $7.5\%$  broadband penetration, nearly  $80\%$  multichannel penetration, and a  $\sim$ 2.50 multichannel ARPU.

# Reinvesting In International Growth

We believe management's strategy is to reinvest in international subscriber growth by investing in expanding content, marketing, technology/network, and payments infrastructure.

We are forecasting Netflix to add about 100M subscribers outside of the US over the next 10 years. However, we believe that achieving this growth trajectory will require continued investment in content – original content, local content, and licensed Hollywood content. Figures 32-33 illustrate the fact that Netflix's international versions of the service are less robust than the US version, despite pricing being similar against a backdrop of lower propensity to pay for content. 2016 is seeing a significant increase in programming expense; we're estimating  $72\%$  growth in international content amortization, which represents about  $20\%$  growth on per subscriber basis. We expect some modest unit cost leverage post-2018 as a result of strong subscriber growth, but we are forecasting  $30\%$  growth in content costs in 2017, followed by  $23\%$  growth in 2018.

# Subscriber, ARPU, And Contribution Margin Forecast (International)

Our forecast for Netflix's international streaming business approaches 133M subscribers by 2026, up from 34M today. Based on industry estimates for global broadband household growth, we estimate that our subscriber forecast implies  $\sim 17\%$  penetration of international broadband homes (ex. China).

Figure 39: International Subscriber Forecast  
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/9cf0ab15-304d-4164-b091-0de1ada1b24e/6670a2521c066869fcb37c32015f27ac0f69880c929395c827f139b473a9f93d.jpg)

We think ARPU growth will remain modest at  $\sim 2\%$  post-2017 given that the relative value proposition vs. Pay-TV in international markets is not as attractive as in the US given less content and lower pay TV ARPU. Furthermore, most international markets have substantially lower GDP per capita than the US, resulting in less disposable income. As we mentioned in our discussion of VPNs, if Netflix is successful in monitoring and enforcing its restrictions on VPNs, it could open the door for them to have a dynamic pricing model that could help raise ARPUs in developed markets, where we think there's more room for ARPU growth.

The result of our subscriber and ARPU forecast is \(15.6B in international streaming revenue by 2026.

We are forecasting international contribution margin to reach  $17\%$  in 2020 and  $37\%$  by 2026. We think that Netflix will remain focused on driving subscriber growth and to accomplish that, will need to continue reinvesting in content.

Password Sharing Limits Penetration Opportunity, But Is A Longer Term Opportunity If It Can Be Solved

Comparisons to Pay-TV penetration levels in the US are not apples-to-apples in our view. The high end of Netflix's long-term opportunity, as it sees it, in the US is 90M subscribers. On today's broadband market, that would look something like current Pay-TV penetration levels. However, we know anecdotally that: (1) there's legitimate "family" sharing through Netflix's multistream plans; and (2) there's a prevalence of password sharing across what would be hard to describe as a "family" plan. In a recent survey that we commissioned, we found  $7\%$  of our respondents identified themselves as sharing login credentials with someone they did not live with, equating to about  $9\%$  of Netflix subscribers in the survey. One of the main value proposition that Netflix brings to consumers is essentially a "TV Everywhere" experience, i.e. available on most any device, anywhere a subscriber is connected. This, however, is essentially the enabling characteristic for account sharing. Netflix offers a 4-simultaneous stream package that is not limited in the number profiles that can be created, allowing extended families to utilize the service in a way that would traditionally represent multiple Pay-TV households.

# ARPU Growth Outlook

# Growth In Usage and Subscribers Supports Pricing Power, with Further ARPU Benefit From 4K Mix Shift

Consumption of Netflix continues to grow nicely on a per subscriber basis. The company reported more than 40B hours of content streamed globally at its 2016 CES event, implying per subscriber usage trending towards 1.8 hours per day. We note that this is a global number, but the company has mentioned

usage rates don't dramatically differ across geographies. As we discuss later in this report, the per-subscriber usage needs some adjustment if we compare to traditional TV because of password sharing. In short, we believe that a single Netflix subscriber encompasses more than 1 traditional Pay-TV subscription. Nonetheless, as Netflix users find more and more value in the service, we think that portends healthy opportunity for pricing power. The further adoption of 4K TVs also presents a mix shift-related pricing opportunity that could aid in growing ARPU for Netflix.

On a cost per hour of usage, Netflix prices at a significant discount to traditional TV. Of course, Netflix offers no sports, no news, and most of the content still represents repeats that have already been on TV. Repeats are inherently less valuable to a consumer than first run programming. Nielsen estimates that the average American household watches more than 8 hours of traditional TV per day, of which about  $70\%$  is live and  $30\%$  is time-shifted. We also backed out an estimate of advertising time, roughly a 15min average ad-load. We also assume that in non-linear viewing,  $60\%$  of what would have been ad consumption is skipped. The conclusion here is that Netflix offers good value.

Note that using mean usage is probably misleading as heavy streamers in all likelihood are pulling the mean up to a level that is noticeably higher than the median usage. We see this with broadband usage in general. Netflix cannot make pricing decisions based on mean usage, and it certainly doesn't, nor can we judge its pricing power based on mean usage.

# How Much Pricing Power Does Netflix Have In the US?

Despite what appears to be an attractive value proposition, we don't think Netflix's US pricing power is as large others think because Netflix is viewed by the vast majority of its customers as a supplement to their core television experience, which is Pay TV. Thus, Pay TV is a staple for most Netflix subscribers, while Netflix is discretionary. This is not to say that there aren't customers who would be willing to pay \$20/month for Netflix. However, we think that number (of customers who would) is relatively modest. Therefore, if

Netflix wants to reach its long term subscriber target of 60-90M in the US, it will have to be somewhat restrained in taking price. We do think there is some room to take price and still grow subscribers, and we think there's opportunity from mix shift toward the premier 4-stream/4K tier.

See the discussion of our survey results below for additional discussion on pricing power.

# Programming Expense Outlook: How Much Operating Leverage Is There In Programming Expense?

The amount of operating leverage that Netflix has in its programming cost budget is a key issue. Netflix has become more selective in licensing content from studios, while increasing original programming toward its goal of about 50/50 licensed content/originals. Given where penetration is in the US today, we think that the incremental dollar of programming spend will generate a decreasing number of new subscribers. Instances of programming costs remaining flat or increasing only marginally while the top-line remains robust are difficult to find. We're skeptical that Netflix can drive subscriber growth without relatively steady levels of per sub investment. We estimate that Netflix will amortize approximately  \$2.4B worth of streaming content this year for the US business, which equates to\$ 4.41 per average paying subscriber. HBO spends about \$2B per year, or about \$6 per US subscriber. In our forecast period, we expect Netflix will need to grow programming expense per subscriber in order to achieve the level of subscriber growth the company is targeting.

# Survey Results Indicate Account Sharing Is Less Pervasive Than We Expected And Sheds Some Light On Pricing Power

To help shed light on the prevalence of sharing, and its implications on penetration, usage and pricing power, we commissioned a survey of 1,000 domestic Netflix users. We found that  $21\%$  of our sample identified as either "Sharers" or "Co-Op Sharers", labels we created where Sharers use someone else's credentials to log-in without contributing to the cost of the subscription. Co-Op Sharers are defined as those who do contribute to the cost of the subscription. The table below outlines the demographic breakdown of our sample set by these labels. There is a clear contrast in the proportion of sharers in the 18-25 age range vs the other demos, which is what one would expect. Interestingly, we also see a higher proportion of sharers over the age of 50, which we believe represents empty nesters who are actually sharing their children's accounts.

Figure 48: Breakdown of Survey Responders  

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="6">Age Demographic</td><td rowspan="2">Total</td></tr><tr><td>18-25</td><td>26-30</td><td>31-35</td><td>36-40</td><td>41-50</td><td>Over 50</td></tr><tr><td>Owner</td><td>106</td><td>156</td><td>168</td><td>121</td><td>116</td><td>124</td><td>791</td></tr><tr><td>Sharer</td><td>44</td><td>15</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>11</td><td>15</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>Co-op Sharer</td><td>28</td><td>23</td><td>12</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>24</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1,000</td></tr></table>

An important distinction, we think, involves whether or not those sharing the account are cohabitating with the account owners. Otherwise, it's really no different than a household sharing a traditional pay-TV subscription. Of the 209 individuals self-identifying as non-account owners, 70 reported that they live independently from the account owner; meaning that  $7\%$  of the users in our survey were sharing an account with someone outside of their household. Therefore, these 70 represent approximately a  $9\%$  increment to the reported account owner or subscriber that we would expect for a more traditional household definition.

Figure 49: "Out of Home" Sharers  

<table><tr><td></td><td>18-25</td><td>26-30</td><td>31-35</td><td>36-40</td><td>41-50</td><td>Over 50</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sharers</td><td>18</td><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Co-op Sharers</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>23</td><td>15</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>13</td><td>70</td></tr></table>

Source: Deutsche Bank

A  $9\%$  increment to the 46M current domestic Netflix subscribers, suggests that the delineated household subscriber count is more like 50M, adding 400-500 bps of broadband penetration, bringing the real penetration level to  $55\%$  of consumer broadband households.

Not surprisingly, we found that willingness to pay for the service (should Netflix decide to clamp down on sharing) was lower in these co-horts vs. the account owners. However, we're not convinced Netflix should or could meaningfully change the way it deals with account sharing, given that ubiquity of the service across devices and geography are core components of its value proposition, and that multi-stream tiers are a means to monetize sharers more than non-sharers. That said, one must be careful about being too bullish on ARPU and subscriber growth at the same time. Nonetheless, only  $25\%$  and  $11\%$  of the Sharers and Co-Op Sharers, respectively, reported an unwillingness to purchase a subscription should Netflix disable the ability for them to share log-in credentials.

# Willingness To Pay Seemingly Constrained Amongst Owners

Our survey indicated that account owners would be willing to spend, on average, up to \$17 per month on their Netflix subscription; a healthy increase from the effective ARPU today of ~\$9 per month. However, averages can be misleading with several outliers at the top end of the range. The median price reported was \$12 per month. We don't have a breakdown of the tiers that our responders subscribe to, but note that those who claim they share their accounts also reported a median willingness to pay of \$12. This could be an anchoring effect around Netflix's current pricing structure, but we think the survey indicates some constraint on pricing power domestically. However, as we mentioned above with the non-account owners in our survey, particularly those living independently, there was a strong indication that they'd be willing to pay for a subscription (80% of Out of Home Shareers/Co-Op Shareers), albeit at a lower price point (~\$9 per month). The challenge we see for Netflix is tiering the service in a way to capture this consumer surplus without introducing much more complexity to the product, something that is contradictory to the company's product strategy that focuses on simplicity and transparency.

# Netflix Is Rarely An Exclusive Video Source For Users; It Is Complementary

Netflix has long maintained its place in the entertainment budget for consumers as complementary - to traditional Pay-TV and other streaming services. Our survey confirms that view. Only  $5\%$  of our survey (which required Netflix usage to participate) used Netflix exclusively amongst either traditional Pay-TV or other streaming services. Pay-TV exposure among account owners in our survey was  $84\%$ . Among Shareers and Co-Op Shareers, we saw lower levels of Pay-TV penetration, but still fairly robust in the  $70 - 75\%$  range. Moreover, there's also a strong indication that consumers are using multiple streaming services, with half of our sample subscribing to Amazon Prime and Hulu. Nearly  $1/3$  of our sample reported using Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.

Therefore, we don't think that consumers do, nor investors should, view Netflix's pricing power as a function of replacing or substituting Pay-TV. Rather, we see evidence to suggest that Netflix will compete with others for share of wallet, which isn't a zero-sum game, but it isn't the fertile delta between Pay-TV and Netflix, either.

# Competitive Dynamics In The US

# Is Access to Content Becoming A Problem For Netflix?

We think that maintaining Netflix's current level of domestic licensing spend is achievable despite more competition from Hulu and Amazon, as well as increasing retention by the networks of full season stacking rights for current seasons of their shows. The reason we believe this to be the case is threefold. First, the rights to past seasons of shows are still readily available to Netflix. Second, the amount of TV shows being made has been increasing for the past  $5+$  years (and is still increasing), meaning that the number of shows hitting syndication/licensing windows every year is still on the rise and will continue to grow for at least another few years. Third, the broadcast networks are being more selective than ever in procuring programming from third party studios so that they can monetize the back end of their shows, which results in more product available to Netflix from the likes of Warner Brothers, Sony, and smaller independent studios. This last point applies to both licensed shows and Netflix originals.

Participation rights and financing structures obligate studios to sell to the highest bidder, which is one of the key reasons the industry needed to fund Hulu. A studio simply saying no to Netflix's offer to license a show was not an option given these obligations, thus Hulu provides a competitive bidder for licensed content in the same windows as Netflix. Over time, contractual terms can adapt to give the vertically integrated studios more flexibility in directing where and to whom content is sold. We doubt these studios are now interested in taking on more financial and creative risk in order to starve Netflix of content, but in theory, studios could get more creative with how they structure participations in order to make it more difficult for Netflix to access content. However, doing so could impair a studio's competitiveness as a magnet for talent.

While making a show for Netflix is, today, considered an exciting proposition by many in the business of making television shows, the disadvantage for talent is that any original program made for Netflix only lives on Netflix. There's no participation in a back end with huge upside potential if a show becomes a hit. One could argue that the talent can negotiate for better for terms after a few seasons if a show turns out to be a hit, but the questions is will they even know if it is a hit and, if so, to what degree? Unlike the traditional television world, there would seem to be a lack of price discovery for talent with Netflix. This information asymmetry is a benefit to Netflix over the long run, assuming it doesn't impair the company's competitiveness in attracting talent and top new shows. Netflix can, naturally, share more information with talent if it needs to; this is just part of the negotiation.

A recent blog article by Exstreamist, an SVOD focused media blog, suggests that the overall quantity of titles available to US subscribers is down on the order of  $50\%$  since 2012. We think Netflix has culled the library of licensed content by design, increasing the amount of original content and allocating

more dollars toward fewer licensed titles to improve quality while reducing clutter. Our intuition is that to date, this has been a function of more competitive bidding from Amazon and Hulu and a strategic decision by Netflix rather than a concerted effort from sellers to keep content away from Netflix.

# Who Spends What on Content

We looked at implied valuations in the context of Enterprise Value to annual content amortization expense for some of the major media companies and Netflix. The companies more exposed to the general entertainment cable networks business, given their affiliate revenue generation, trade between 6x and 7x, a premium to FOX and CBS at  $\sim 5\mathrm{x}$ ; which have greater exposure to broadcast. The broadcast networks and station groups are still developing their retransmission revenue reverse compensation streams, thus, their monetization is improving and narrowing the gap with cable networks over time. DISCA and SNI trade at 8-10x due to their lower cost programming and resulting margins. Netflix trades at more than 8x our projected 2016 content spend. Netflix is clearly growing content spend more aggressively than the comparable set, but we think this indicates that there are lofty profit growth expectations embedded in Netflix's current valuation.

The natural counterpoint to this analysis is that if one believes Netflix's margins will be higher than traditional TV (i.e. monetization is superior) and Netflix's growth rate is higher, then why shouldn't the company trade at a higher EV/programming expense multiple? In our view, it is unlikely that Netflix will end up with higher margins than the cable networks have today given increasing competition in the programming (i.e. content aggregation) level of the industry (where Netflix primarily sits), increasing competition in the distribution layer of the industry, and the fact that Netflix, as a direct-to-consumer service, doesn't benefit from the pay TV bundle oligopoly. Furthermore, there will be a significant amount of FCF generated by the traditional media companies, which will reduce EV in the future (all else equal) through debt repayment and share repurchases.

# Is The Unbundling of Networks: Is It Good Or Bad For Netflix?

The unbundling of networks creates more competition; fragmentation that potentially makes it harder for Netflix to stand out. However, with Netflix stepping up its original programming spend meaningfully while increasing licensed programming spend at the same time, Netflix's strong value proposition is highlighted against competitors with thinner content offerings. We think Netflix will always be a complementary service given the continued importance of live programming, but fragmentation of the big bundle could provide an opportunity for Netflix to play a larger role in the construction of smaller bundles, either formally or DIY.

# Hulu Stepping Up Its Game

Ever since Hulu owners 21st Century Fox, Disney, and Comcast agreed to infuse \(750M in equity capital into the company in 2013, Hulu has become a much stronger competitor in the OTT space, both with current season broadcast shows and a growing library of prior season licensed content and even a few originals. Furthermore, Hulu has gone out and secured high profile content like the entire library of Seinfeld, South Park, and broader deals with Viacom, Epix, and other cable networks. We think Hulu has significantly narrowed the gap with Netflix in regards to its UI and platform availability. That said, Hulu hasn't yet proven that it can narrow the subscriber gap with Netflix.

Many in the industry thought Hulu could help to preserve the TV advertising ecosystem and capture younger demos. Somewhat contrary to that thesis, Hulu introduced an ad-free option for \$11.99 in September 2015, vs. the \$5.99 ad-supported price point. We initially scratched our head at the idea that its media conglomerate owners would be interested in potentially accelerating the shift towards non ad-supported models, but in the context of competing with Netflix we think it was ultimately a needed strategic move. We estimate Hulu is now approaching 12M subs, still well behind Netflix, but certainly moving in the right direction.

# Hulu Live & DIRECTV Now

Hulu Live, a  $40-$ 50 (introductory tier) per month service is targeted to launch in early 2017. This will essentially be a pay TV service that is streamed over the internet. DIRECTV is planning to launch a similar service by YE16. Sling TV and Sony Vue represent similar services that are already in the market. Hulu Live has the luxury of under-pricing traditional MVPD price points as it can price the content essentially at cost, removing the distributor costs and margin in the process. In addition, the consumer will bear most of the video transport cost through her home broadband connection, a cost that consumers largely think of as fixed. The lower price point should lead to a higher pay TV penetration than we'd otherwise see, which we think could result in a flat to positive growth outlook for pay TV subscribers. So long as Hulu owners are receiving similar or better affiliate fees for their content, they should be relatively agnostic if they monetize through Hulu or the traditional ecosystem.

We don't see Hulu Live or DIRECTV Now as major threats to Netflix because they are just Pay-TV services, and the vast majority of Netflix subscribers already have Pay-TV. However, we do think that they will convert some number of households (in the millions) from non Pay-TV to Pay-TV households. This should reduce the utility of Netflix among this group of households, which in theory should reduce pricing power to a degree. However, we do not see Hulu Live and DIRECTV Now as a driver if disconnects or lower gross adds for Netflix.

# Could Rebundling Be A Threat?

We know that the majority of Netflix subscribers also subscribe to Pay-TV and some subscribe to Hulu, Amazon Prime, or both. We know that Apple TV, Roku, and other popular devices are increasingly integrating services with features like universal search that can discover content across multiple services. To us, this seems to indicate that Netflix is likely to remain a complementary service, at least domestically. We think this creates a ceiling with respect to pricing power for the service. We're not discounting the value proposition of Netflix, but with respect to the platform vs. network/aggregator question we think the trend supports the latter.

On the other hand, we think Netflix could see some benefit from traditional distributors incorporating Netflix into MVPD set top boxes. DISH has integrated Netflix into its Hopper series boxes for some time now. Cable STBs with Tivo UIs have integrated Netflix for some time. The coup de grace, however, came recently with the announcements that Liberty Global and Comcast would be integrating Netflix into their platforms. Comcast has announced a Fall '16 update to its X1 platform that will incorporate Netflix. We think Charter seems willing to do something similar.

# Usage Based Pricing Is Bad For Netflix

Usage based pricing is standard practice today in the mobile industry. Its use is less consistent, but still common, in the fixed line broadband business. For large operators, it remains a political lightning rod, which is the reason we've seen data allowances move higher (Comcast has gone from 250 GB initially to now 1 TB). Netflix recently asked the FCC to consider regulating the use of usage-based pricing for broadband. We believe that some operators (e.g. Charter, Verizon, Altice) will continue to offer an unlimited broadband tier in accordance with their business plan. Comcast's 1 TB allowance still leaves significant breathing room for nearly all customers. However, we think that caps in the 300 GB range will increasingly be exceeded; triggering overage

charges, potentially raising political/regulatory concerns, and negatively impacting Netflix's business. In a worst case scenario, usage-based pricing could mean that Netflix needs to have a smaller content catalog in the future because consumers will limit their consumption.

# Amazon: Prime Instant Video

Amazon Prime Instant Video has the clear advantage in terms of being bundled into a suite of services in which customers find value. We think most subscribers find the Free Two-Day Shipping the major draw, but with Prime Video, Prime Music, Prime Reading, unlimited photo storage in Amazon Cloud (Prime Photos), there's many sources of consumer surplus. At \(99 per year (\)8.25 /mo), Prime Membership, for many, is a great deal. Amazon can do this because Prime enhances the competitive position of Amazon's e-commerce business through customer captivity and habit formation. DB's Ross Sandler and team laid out the case for Prime in their July 2014 piece "Going Prime-Time Extends the Competitive Moat". Amazon continues to extend the value proposition of Prime Membership: Prime Now (1-hour delivery in select markets), Prime Fresh (unlimited grocery delivery, \)200 upcharge annually), etc. We see no reason to believe that Amazon will show reticence to continue adding benefits and improving their offering. Furthermore, Amazon has a global footprint and we expect that international customers are likely to find Prime membership compelling, as well. Ross Sandler estimates Prime memberships now total 75M+ globally, in-line with Netflix's global streaming membership tally. In terms of its ability to scale globally, acquire content, and establish brand-equity with consumers, we think Amazon could be a formidable competitor to Netflix. Recently, Jeff Bezos framed the opportunity for Prime Video succinctly, "we get to monetize (Prime Video) in an unusual way…when we win a Golden Globe, we sell more shoes". Being able to monetize in alternative ways is a major advantage.

In mid-December 2015, Amazon announced its "Streaming Partners Program" where Prime members can expand content choices through add-ons; notably Showtime and Starz for \$8.99/mo each. The unbundling of traditional networks is well under-way, but now we are starting to see re-bundling. Amazon's Prime platform should be a very attractive platform for content owners and networks as it is large, growing and global. Most recently, Amazon announced standalone monthly Prime Video pricing for \$8.99 per month (as well as the full Prime bundle for \$10.99 per month).

We think Amazon has been slow to fully embrace Android and iOS (or tvOS, for that matter) given that Amazon is selling hardware that is meant to compete with Apple TV and Chromecast. Amazon has developed applications for both Android and iOS, but has yet to roll out on Apple's new operating system (tvOS). Amazon conspicuously removed both the Apple TV and Chromecast from amazon.com, but we doubt that Amazon will choose to remain off of those operating system platforms in the long term. Amazon Prime Instant Video is available on the major consoles, mobile platforms, smart TVs, and Roku. Given Apple TV's scale and now open platform, we expect Amazon to develop a tvOS app.

Furthermore, we see a live OTT video component as something that makes strategic sense for Amazon, given their unique ability to monetize through retail sales. At the very least, we know Amazon takes a very long view and is certainly not afraid to be very disruptive.

# Amazon Studios: Sourcing and Developing Original Content

Amazon launched Amazon Studios in late 2010 as a way to essentially crowd-source TV and film scripts and concepts. Amazon provides free screen-writing software to help facilitate the process. An article from Wired in 2013 suggested that to that point, Amazon had received nearly 2,700 television scripts and now accepts scripts from members of the Writers Guild of America. Clearly, only a very small percent of ideas submitted are taken to pilot and ultimately become series, but Amazon's development pipeline in original content is not insignificant. According to FutonCritic.com, Amazon has  $\sim 14$  original series in development that have ordered to series and should appear on the service in the near term. SVOD operators have the luxury of not bearing opportunity cost related to linear schedules (there's only one Sunday 9PM EST), but Amazon seems to be building Prime Video with intentions of significant scale.

We estimate that Amazon has released about 255 hours of original content to date, with a strong pipeline of new shows yet to come. Both Transparent and Mozart In The Jungle, have won major Golden Globe or Emmy categories. Man In The High Castle, Bosch, Catastrophe, Red Oaks, and others have also garnered positive critical reviews. With Amazon's unique monetization strategy and hyper-focus on the consumer experience, we think Amazon will be a force in video.

# Original Content

# A Significant Push For Quantity and Quality

# Overview of Netflix's Original Programming

Netflix has grown the quantity of original programming dramatically in a short time frame. From House of Cards premier in early 2013, we estimate Netflix has invested in nearly 1,200 hours of original programming across 165 titles, to date. Kids programming, by our estimates, represents nearly 1/3 of cumulative programming, and contributes a sizeable portion of the development pipeline. According to futoncritic.com, Netflix has 63 new titles ordered to series, including 24 Kids titles. The speed and scope of Netflix's original programming investment has been truly impressive.

In 2015, Netflix released  $\sim 350$  hours of original programming. The company plans to release more than 600 hours of original programming in 2016.

Netflix has maintained that the mix of original/licensed content should trend towards 50/50 in the long run (we expect Netflix to reach this target in 2019), including television and films. Netflix's new film output deal with Disney has begun with Zootopia hitting Netflix in the last month. Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer, has downplayed future output deals (both in terms of film and TV), but has commented that movies comprise 1/3 of Netflix consumption.

Netflix is not the only programmer pursuing a significant push into expanded scripted content. As we mentioned previously, the industry has significantly ramped content production over the last handful of years. Most of the growth has come from basic cable, and Netflix's peer group of SVOD players have started to contribute in a serious way. Still, Netflix alone represents about  $7\%$  of current US production, albeit growing faster than the industry.

Netflix has also started to see traction from a critical perspective. Starting in 2013, primarily from the success of House of Cards, Netflix has each year grown the total number of major, prime time Emmy nominations. Wins have come less easily, but the trend is clear. In the last 3 years, Netflix has trailed only HBO and FX in terms of total major prime time Emmy nominations.

Netflix has steadily closed the gap with its traditional network competitors when it comes to Emmy nominations. Starting from 5 nominations in 2013, Netflix garnered 17 major PT Emmy nominations; 3rd overall behind HBO and FX.

Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term ratings.

Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst concerned or of the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals.

Prices and availability of financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash

flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options", at http://www/optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i) exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.

Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the investor's home jurisdiction.
