# Can Netflix be a leader in this brave new world of content?

Investment conclusion: The competitive environment for consumer video consumption has changed from the days of DVD by mail. Barriers to entry have changed as Netflix's business model evolves; Google and Amazon have emerged as serious, deep-pocketed competitors for content, which will drive mid / long-term content costs higher. We are reducing our estimates and our fair value estimate to \$180 but remain Equal-weight.

Why did Netflix increase prices?: Netflix raised prices to properly monetize its streaming service, which was originally complementary to its DVD by mail offering and was priced as such. With content costs rising, Netflix was forced to better match its revenue and costs. We do not believe the price increases were to drive DVD subs away – quite the contrary, DVD subs now serve an important role in subsidizing streaming content costs.

Why is Netflix separating its businesses?: We believe Netflix is gearing up for a new era where content owners will price content based on "the right to stream", not based on which subs actually stream. By separating the two offerings, Netflix will pay less than if it continued to offer hybrid subscription plans in which hybrid subs have the right to stream but may not choose to do so.

Where we differ: We believe Netflix is facing an uphill battle for premium content as its resources for content acquisition are directly tied to its subscriber base. On the contrary, both Google and Amazon have very different strategic goals with investment objectives that are not directly tied to ARPU rates. As such, we believe Netflix is facing a phase of increasing content costs in which it has few obvious countermeasures.

Valuation: The adverse news flow coincided with an uncertain macro environment, which has likely caused Netflix's multiple to compress too far. We believe, however, that when the smoke clears, Netflix's multiple will be challenged due to increased downside risk to the company's long-term margin profile.

# Why Equal-weight?

- Netflix is facing a war for content as scarcity value increases cost. Although the debate is less about stickiness of subs (long term), the value to subs vs. economics to shareholder dilemma is very real.  
- Netflix has created a scale-based competitive advantage around user experience.

# Key Value Drivers

- Slowing sub growth – the loyal sub base has already been acquired; incremental net adds will become more difficult.  
- Increasing content costs will handicap margin expansion, but Netflix should benefit from international expansion.  
- Netflix streaming device / content deals improve value proposition.

# Potential Catalysts

- Potential for Starz negotiations to resume; deadline is CQ1:12.  
- Positive data points from international expansion, specifically subscriber growth.

# Key Questions

- How will the shift to digital streaming impact Netflix? Specifically, what impact will content deals have on gross margin?  
- How will Netflix fare in the war for content against the likes of Google and Amazon.com?  
- Was Netflix's ARPU for its streaming offering based on an artificially low streaming content licensing agreement?

# Key Risks

Rising digital content licensing costs  
Usage-based broadband pricing

# Investment Case

Historically, Netflix has thrived on the edge of innovation for video content distribution…

The Past: Revolutionized the way Americans consume video content.

In a world where the local video store charged upwards of \(5 per video, per night, Netflix rewrote the rules by providing subscribers an "all you can eat" offering at price points that seemed unsustainable. As the company grew in scale and content agreements were signed, Netflix evolved into a household name, preparing to lead Americans through the next stage of content distribution – streaming.

The Present: Leading the physical to digital transition.

Streaming video has contributed to subscriber growth acceleration when pundits believed the business model had matured. Management's foresight to create ubiquitous access through partnerships with device manufacturers has paid off handsomely. The American household has multiple devices capable of streaming video content; growth in user adoption of Android and Apple iOS devices has also grown mind and wallet share.

Exhibit 1 Netflix has enjoyed two "Golden Eras" of accelerating domestic subscriber growth

The Future: Replicate its strategy in international markets.

Last year, Netflix announced its entrance into the Canadian market, followed by Latin America this year. We suspect that Netflix will also be heading into Western Europe beginning in 2012. Netflix is only offering its streaming subscription in international markets.

…but now the company's business model appears to be facing fundamental challenges.

Incremental subscriber acquisition will be more difficult. While we believe the current domestic subscriber base is fairly sticky, it appears Netflix's ride on the "s-curve" may be hitting the brakes. The sub who sat on the sidelines through the era of the \$9.99 plan now faces an inferior value proposition at \$15.98 for the same content. The only way she converts into a paying sub is if prices decrease (highly unlikely) or content improves (which we argue will come with challenges).

The streaming video business is drawing new competitors into the mix.

There are two competitive forces on the horizon: competitors for subscribers (Blockbuster 2.0) and competitors for content. We are less concerned about the prior but very focused on the latter. In the era of DVDs by mail and fulfillment centers, the barriers to entry were quite high because of Netflix's superior brand equity and the required capital to build a network of fulfillment centers. In the world of video streaming, Google and Amazon have superior content delivery infrastructure and much larger war chests of cash for content acquisition. Neither Google nor Amazon is looking to recreate Netflix or instigate a mass exodus of Netflix's subs; they just want content. The rising content costs for Netflix are merely collateral damage – something the company has little control over.

Quantity of content is limited and quality of content is even more so.

We believe Netflix has and will continue to develop a best in class TV content portfolio. With uncertainty surrounding the Starz contract renegotiation, however, Netflix risks losing a material amount of its output film content. The greater concern, however, is that even though Netflix will have considerable resources to acquire content, the company will not be able to replace the quality of the lost film content.

Subscribers want value, which limits Netflix's pricing power.

With looming content cost increases, Netflix must double-down on its commitment to its most valuable asset, its subscriber base. The company can ill afford to have additional attrition. We believe the company will undergo a brand rebuilding phase over the next 18 months where it must prove that it still has the best value proposition in town. This consumer value imperative limits Netflix's pricing power, thus forcing the company to go all-in on its plans for international expansion.

# Debate 1: "Virtuous Cycle Lives" or "Vicious Spiral Looms"?

Market's view: The market is unsure, although it is likely focusing more on subscriber figures and less on mid / long-term content cost issues.

Our view: There are real and growing competitive pressures on Netflix's "Virtuous Cycle" relating to content acquisition that could easily turn into a "Vicious Spiral".

# Netflix's "Virtuous Cycle" in the US is experiencing pressure and risks impairment.

The company has long touted the strength of its "Virtuous Cycle":

A good value proposition will increase subscribers.  

- Increased subscribers will allow Netflix to cut larger checks to acquire more and better content.  
- More and better content will create an even more compelling value proposition. Repeat.

# Lower quality content…

Whether you are a Bear or a Bull, February 2012 grows ever closer, and Starz has publicly stated that it no longer wishes to continue negotiations toward a renewed content agreement. If no agreement is reached, Netflix will lose almost half of its output film inventory. For a portfolio that already favors TV to film content, losing the high-quality Starz titles would be a setback to Netflix's streaming offering.

Exhibit 2 Output film catalogs are highly concentrated; if not Starz, then what?

# …less value…

For the customer, losing Starz content may not be the doomsday scenario that Wall Street predicts, however, the situation does leave the subscriber with fewer options. The secret to success in streaming is to have enough variety such that the subscriber always feels content after consuming content. Lack of content breeds disinterest, which leaves the subscriber vulnerable to alternative options. Until recently, there were no other viable options – this is changing.

# …fewer subscribers…

We have seen empirical evidence that subscribers vote with their "cancel buttons" when the value proposition is negatively affected. Among the announced price increase on July 12, the effective date of the price increase and Starz' press release on September 1 and the announced separation of the DVD by mail and streaming businesses on September 18, Netflix has sustained  $7.7\mathrm{B}$  of shareholder value destruction  $(-50\%)$  and has revised Q3:11 subscriber estimates down by 1MM. If the value proposition deteriorates further, it is possible that we will witness an acceleration in subscriber attrition.

# …less money to acquire content. Repeat.

The loss of subs, especially long-time subs materially hurts Netflix. The company loses the ever-important word-of-mouth advertising, and foregoes the economics that would have contributed to the solution. With fewer subs and less money, successive rounds at the negotiating table with content owners / aggregators will yield an inferior scenario for the remaining subs.

Exhibit 3  
Virtuous Cycles can turn into Vicious Spirals…

# Debate 2: How is Netflix positioned for the Content Wars?

Market's view: The market is focused on subscriber counts as the key risk to the "Virtuous Cycle" unraveling. Our view: We believe the market should focus on the secular changes in content acquisition; the next generation of competitors have outsized resources to bid for content as well as the requisite infrastructure and experience to deliver streaming content to users.

# Content is a key part of the "Virtuous Cycle".

At the heart of Netflix's value proposition is the ability for the company to offer every single subscriber something that she will want to watch, when she wants to watch it. This is offered through both having a broad selection of content and also by leveraging Netflix's recommendation algorithms. Any risks related to content acquisition / availability are material and could easily disrupt Netflix's "Virtuous Cycle". We maintain that the quality of content is more important than the quantity of content.

# The Starz press release is a material uncertainty with potentially very negative consequences.

On September 1, 2011, Starz issued a press release stating that it has ended contract renewal negotiations with Netflix. Assuming the contract with Starz is not renewed, Netflix's maximum market share of box office output films is only  $27\%$ . Of that, Netflix already has a deal signed with EPIX that constitutes 16 of the 27 points. HBO has been unwilling to sign any content agreements with Netflix; we believe HBO may be looking to make its own foray into direct to consumer distribution, in the future.

# Comprehensive negotiations with studios for output film content are not possible (at least for now).

The Starz renewal saga is compounded by the fact that there are no other alternative avenues for Netflix to obtain output film content. Almost all of the major studios are currently in exclusive contracts with premium cable networks. While we believe the studios would be open to negotiating with Netflix when the contracts are up for renewal, the costs will be significant as studios do not let distributors cherry pick the best films – they require commitments for a full slate, which represents a substantial financial commitment. HBO, for example, spends  $\sim$ 1B just for its output film content. That is in addition to the  $\sim$ 600MM it spends on producing original content.

Exhibit 4 Output film content is locked up in exclusive contracts with premium cable networks.

* We believe the MGM and Paramount's exclusive agreements will extend through at least 2015.

# Amazon and Google are in the battle for content, not subs.

The most precarious part about the looming content wars is that Netflix's fiercest competitors for content have completely separate agendas. Amazon is focused on growing eCommerce wallet share. Google has ambitions of maintaining dominance in search and cracking into social. Both companies view video content as a means to an end. Frankly, Amazon is better at execution than Google. Having incongruent costs of capital and return hurdles puts Netflix at a disadvantage. Simply put, Amazon and Google may assign a higher value to streaming video content than Netflix.

# Scale matters, and Netflix may not be large enough.

Both Amazon and Google have used loss-leader strategies in the past. As the two companies grow, their ability to risk larger amounts of capital with less material downside increases. Netflix does not have the comparable scale to match the financial resources of Amazon or Google, nor does it have adjacent business lines that can help subsidize margin pressures. The best solution Netflix currently has is to run Qwikster as a cash-cow yield business and use the proceeds to acquire content for domestic streaming content and to invest in international subscriber acquisition. Note, however, that management has stated in the past that DVD by mail will be a secular declining business over time, so Qwikster's subsidization is not a long-term solution.

# Debate 3: Is international expansion the third "S-Curve"?

Market's view: The international story is the only thing that is supporting the company's stock, currently. International subscriber growth is the new Netflix story. Our view: We see multiple points of friction in international markets. Pricing appears to be alienating a portion of the potential addressable market, and there are incumbent offerings that Netflix will have to deal with.

# Innovation is at the heart of the company's DNA.

Reed Hastings and his team have led Netflix through two very difficult, very dynamic transitions: 1) the transition from bricks and mortar DVD rentals to DVDs by mail and 2) from physical video content to streaming video content. By having courage of conviction, Netflix has enjoyed a double "S-Curve" of sorts where both subscribers and financial performance accelerated at unprecedented rates.

# Precedents suggest Netflix will be successful internationally.

With a streaming-only subscription offering, Netflix's international success is contingent upon four things: broadband penetration, content, brand awareness and value. Netflix does not have to build-out fulfillment centers, nor deal with local postal systems. While these four points may appear straightforward, execution may not be frictionless.

# "It ain't cheap."

We look at two primary metrics to judge whether or not the relative cost of Netflix's subscriptions are priced with consumer value in mind: 1) Netflix subscription price vs. cable TV ARPU and 2) Netflix subscription prices on a purchasing power parity basis relative to the US.

# To succeed, Netflix must narrow its field of competitors.

One of the toughest challenges Netflix will face is the presence of incumbent competition. Depending upon price points, competition may be cable TV plans. Netflix management has always spoken of its streaming offering as a complementary service to the cable box. It appears, however, that Netflix has priced its streaming service at a high point, relative to basic cable when compared to the US. The higher the percentage of the basic cable package, the better the content has to be or in the worst case, the lower the adoption level.

Exhibit 5 With the exception of Brazil, Netflix's LatAm pricing is higher than the US, relative to basic cable TV  
![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/28ec6a39-2893-4d75-9122-95ffdd29d9eb/37d59e18ffc4d9f95dc81728e3342e93893ef94c5ffe1a8b51e9380a720e51c5.jpg)  
Source: informa; Morgan Stanley Research

Opportunity cost of purchasing power cannot be ignored. In terms of value, based on purchasing power, the prices across the large Latin American countries are higher than the US. We believe these price points will narrow the TAM as fewer people have the disposable income to purchase a subscription.

Exhibit 6 On a purchasing power parity basis, Netflix's LatAm pricing is more expensive than the US

# STOCK RATINGS

Morgan Stanley uses a relative rating system using terms such as Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated or Underweight (see definitions below). Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover. Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight are not the equivalent of buy, hold and sell. Investors should carefully read the definitions of all ratings used in Morgan Stanley Research. In addition, since Morgan Stanley Research contains more complete information concerning the analyst's views, investors should carefully read Morgan Stanley Research, in its entirety, and not infer the contents from the rating alone. In any case, ratings (or research) should not be used or relied upon as investment advice. An investor's decision to buy or sell a stock should depend on individual circumstances (such as the investor's existing holdings) and other considerations.

# Global Stock Ratings Distribution

For disclosure purposes only (in accordance with NASD and NYSE requirements), we include the category headings of Buy, Hold, and Sell alongside our ratings of Overweight, Equal-weight, Not-Rated and Underweight. Morgan Stanley does not assign ratings of Buy, Hold or Sell to the stocks we cover.

# Accelerated Transition To Streaming Creates Near Term Uncertainty, But Growth Story To Return In 2012

Despite adjusting numbers last week, we are again lowering our 3Q (now below revised guidance), 4Q and 2012 estimates on Netflix due to the company's pricing changes and recent Qwikster rebranding announcement. As a result, we are also reducing our price target to  \$205 from\$ 245 though our rating remains Overweight. We recognize the near term challenges for Netflix, but expect growth to return in 2012. Over time we expect Netflix to become more profitable as Qwikster is run more for profit than growth while streaming subscriber growth continues.

- Lower ests. primarily due to lower hybrid subs. We are lowering our domestic hybrid subscriber numbers for 3Q, 4Q, 2012 and now project 23.7MM, 24.1MM, and 31.6MM total US subscribers respectively. However, we are raising our int'l sub ests. based on our new bottom-up analysis of broadband subs by country (see pg 6). We now project 4.9MM/9.9MM int'l subs by the end of 2012/13 respectively. Though we have reduced our 2012 GAAP EPS est. to \$5.62, we are raising our 2013 est. slightly as the DVD business is run for profit.  
- Near term sentiment to remain weak but story to improve in 4Q/2012. Netflix could remain range bound in the near term due to negative news flow from potential competitor announcements (Dish, Amazon, Hulu) and continued disruption from headlines regarding sub churn. However, we think sentiment will improve in 4Q as NFLX signs more content deals and announces new int'l launches, and we expect churn to normalize in 2012.  
- Proprietary survey showed elevated churn. Our prop survey of 1600 current and recent Netflix subs conducted prior to the guidance revision (Sep 9-13) showed elevated levels of churn inline with the company's revised guidance. In addition, the survey showed a high degree of awareness of the pricing change while awareness of Starz content on Netflix was low (see pg 10 for more details).  
- Valuation. Our \$205 YE 2012 price target on NFLX is based on 23x our 2013 PF EPS of \$8.89 vs. a 40% 2010-13E EPS CAGR.

# Accelerated Transition To Streaming Creates Near Term Uncertainty, But Growth Story To Return In 2012

Reiterate Overweight but lowering price target. Despite adjusting numbers last week, we are again lowering our 3Q, 4Q and 2012 estimates on Netflix due to the company's pricing changes and recent Qwikster rebranding announcement. As a result, we are also reducing our price target to  \$205 from\$ 245 though our rating remains Overweight.

We recognize the challenges but think growth can return. Netflix shares are  $-41\%$  QTD vs. the Nasdaq  $-5\%$ . Though Street estimates have come down slightly post the 3Q guidance reduction announcement, we think the stock already reflects a high probability of a potential further reduction in 3Q subscriber guidance and elevated churn in 4Q on the heels of Qwikster. We believe the lack of any viable consensus on a floor for 2012 and 2013 estimates has added to uncertainty and pressured the stock. While we acknowledge these concerns – and our revised numbers reflect this conservatism – we think that Netflix can return to solid subscriber and EPS growth over time as: 1) the streaming only service represented  $\sim 75\%$  of gross adds in 2Q and we expect this number to increase; 2) the streaming only product and price remain unchanged since the streaming/DVD split was announced; 3) we continue to believe the 3Q reduction in subscriber guidance was due to churn rather than weakness in gross adds as  $80\%$  of the miss was in DVD only. Over time we expect Netflix to become more profitable as Qwikster is run more for profit than growth while streaming subscriber growth continues.

Lower estimates primarily due to lower hybrid subscribers. We are lowering our domestic hybrid (DVD + Streaming) subscriber numbers for 3Q, 4Q, 2012 to account for higher churn than previously expected due to the recent rebranding announcement. For 3Q, 4Q, and 2012 we now project 23.7MM, 24.1MM, and 31.6MM total US subscribers respectively. However, we are raising our international subscriber forecasts based on our new bottom-up analysis of addressable broadband subscriptions by country. We now project 4.9MM international subscribers by the end of 2012 and 9.9MM by the end of 2013. Though we have reduced our 2012 GAAP EPS estimate to \$5.62, we are increasing our 2013 EPS estimate slightly as the Qwikster/DVD business is run for profit.

# Near term sentiment to remain weak but story to improve in 4Q and 2012.

NFLX could remain range bound in the near term due to negative news flow from potential competitor announcements (Dish, Amazon, and Hulu) and continued disruption from headlines regarding subscriber churn. However, we think sentiment will improve in 4Q as Netflix signs more content deals and the company announces additional international launches, and we expect churn to normalize in 2012.

Valuation. Our \$205 YE 2012 price target on NFLX is based on 23x our 2013 PF EPS of \$8.89 vs. a 40% 2010-13E EPS CAGR. We maintain our Overweight rating.

# Updating Estimates For Netflix/Qwikster Split and International

While we lowered estimates last week to account for greater 3Q subscriber churn around the price increase, we believe the Qwikster split and related negative press could further weigh on subscribers.

Lowering domestic subscribers: We are lowering our domestic hybrid (DVD + Streaming) subscriber numbers for 3Q, 4Q, 2012 to account for higher churn than previously expected due to the recent rebranding announcement. Given that the DVD business will no longer sit under the Netflix brand (with separate sign-ups, queues, and billing) we think it may be challenging for the Qwikster brand to add as many DVD subscribers as we had previously expected. However, we are modeling higher streaming subscribers (still not offsetting the decline in hybrid subs) as we think the streaming business benefits from clearer marketing under the Netflix brand as well as some churn from the Qwikster business. We model the hybrid business to continue losing subs from 2012-2015 as subscribers migrate more towards streaming only over time. Note that even prior to the pricing change in 2Q, the hybrid business lost  $\sim 200\mathrm{k}$  subs per our estimates. For 3Q, 4Q, and 2012 we project 23.7MM, 24.1MM, and 31.6MM total US subscribers respectively.

Raising international subscribers: We have done a detailed bottom up analysis (see the International section of the report) of Netflix's streaming opportunity in Canada, Latin America, and Europe (UK, Spain, France) based on broadband penetration and found that our prior estimates may be conservative. As a result we are increasing our 2012-2015 international subscriber estimates accordingly, though these changes do not offset the decline in domestic subscribers. We now project 4.9MM international subscribers by the end of 2012 and 9.9MM by the end of 2013.

Revenue: As a result of a decline in hybrid subscribers we are lowering our revenue estimates for 3Q, 4Q, and 2012 to  $802MM,$ 834MM, and \$3.14B respectively.

Cost of goods: Our cost of goods declines substantially due to lower DVD content acquisition costs and DVD postage/packaging. Note that the price change and split may have resulted in Netflix losing nearly  $27\%$  of its DVD subscribers in 3Q and we expect these declines to continue into 4Q and 2012. Our 2012 streaming content expenses in the P&L are also lower due to the loss of the Starz deal which we think may be difficult for Netflix to fully replace with content that is accretive to user streaming hours.

Other operating expenses: Our sales and marketing expenses are moving higher in absolute terms as well as on a per subscriber (SAC) basis as we think the company may lose some marketing efficiency due to the new brand created for the DVD business. In addition, we think international SAC will drive up overall SAC due to Netflix's relative lack of brand awareness in international markets. Our Tech/Dev and G&A expenses are increasing in absolute terms again due to lost synergies from the streaming and DVD split.

Contribution profit margin: Netflix has noted that it plans to run Qwikster for cash flows and the business will have higher contribution margin than the US streaming business due to the lack of required investment. Contribution profit includes COGS and marketing costs, but excludes Tech/Dev, G&A, and stock compensation as these

fixed costs are applied across the Netflix US (streaming only), Qwikster, and international streaming businesses. Netflix's US business (DVD + Streaming) had  $24\%$  contribution margin in 2010 and  $13.5\%$  operating margin including Tech/Dev, G&A and stock compensation expenses. We expect US contribution margin to reach  $27.4\%$  in 2011 ( $15.7\%$  operating margin), falling to  $26.4\%$  ( $13.5\%$  operating margin) in 2012 due to the decline in higher margin DVD subscribers. We expect contribution margin to improve in 2013 to  $31.1\%$  ( $16.8\%$  operating margin) as margins in the US streaming business improve from solid subscriber growth and moderating growth in content expenses.

# Model Now Driven On Subscribers and Subscriptions

In order to reflect the recent split in the US streaming and DVD businesses, our revenue model is now driven off both subscribers and subscriptions, primarily to account for the subscribers that use both streaming and DVD. Our US subscription model is divided into streaming only, streaming plus DVD, and DVD only segments, with streaming plus DVD subscribers accounting for 2 subscriptions.

Given the streaming/DVD split didn't go into effect until the end of 3Q, we believe our 4Q ASP numbers represent a better gauge of monthly subscription ASP. We use the \$7.99 monthly ASP against our streaming subscription forecast. Our streaming plus DVD segment revenue estimate incorporates a \$8.30 blended ASP per

subscription (\$16.60 per subscriber) which primarily consists of \$7.99 streaming only and \$7.99 DVD only plans as well as a small % of higher priced DVD plans, i.e. 2,3,4 DVDs at a time. Similar to the hybrid ASP blend mentioned above, our 4Q DVD only segment revenue employs a \$8.30 monthly ASP. We think ASP in the hybrid and DVD only segments may likely drift closer to \$7.99 over time as we expect new subscription growth to come from the \$7.99 streaming or \$7.99 one at a time DVD plans (thereby replacing higher ASP multi disc plans).

Our international model continues to be driven off of subscriptions which are equivalent to subscribers due to the lack of a DVD offering overseas.

# Building International Bottom-Up

We have updated our international revenue and subscriber forecasts to incorporate a bottom-up analysis of Netflix penetration by country. We use broadband subscriptions by country as the addressable market for Netflix's streaming product. In Canada, Netflix's first foray outside the US, penetration is already  $\sim 10\%$ , less than a year after launching. Netflix launched its streaming service in Latin America in early September, expanding the company's target opportunity by  $\sim 44$  MM broadband subscribers. Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina represent nearly  $75\%$  of broadband subscriptions in the 43 Latin American countries launched and we expect Netflix to focus its marketing and content primarily on these three countries. However, we are modeling a significantly slower adoption rate in Latin America due to: 1) considerably lower discretionary spending levels vs. the US and Canada; 2) lower credit card penetration; 3) slower broadband connection speeds and usage caps. As a result, we are modeling (see Figure 1 below) just  $3\%$  penetration of Latin America broadband subscribers by the end of 2012 - equivalent to 1.2MM Netflix subscribers. As a basis for comparison, we think Canada could reach  $13\%$  penetration by the end of 2012.

Note: 2010 = Yr 1 for US/Canada streaming; 2011 = Yr 1 for Latin America streaming; 2012 = Yr 1 for Europe. US 2010 streaming subscriptions include streaming only subscribers and excludes hybrid subscribers.

We believe that Netflix is considering launches in UK, Spain, and France in 2012. The table below provides greater detail on our international penetration assumptions. Overall, we think Canada, Latin America and Europe (UK, Spain, France) could account for  $\sim 5$ MM subscribers by the end of 2012, with the potential to grow to 18MM by 2015, depending upon competition and NFLX's marketing intensity. We are modeling just  $1\%$  penetration for Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil and  $0.5\%$  penetration in the rest of Latin America in 2011. Assuming an early 2012 launch in UK and Spain, we are modeling  $5\%$  and  $2\%$  penetration of broadband subscriptions in 2012 for UK and Spain respectively. We are modeling  $3\%$  penetration of French broadband subscriptions in 2012 assuming we see a mid year launch in this market. See table 2 for a detailed build of Netflix streaming subscribers by country.

# Key Takeaways From Our Proprietary Survey

We ran a survey of 1600 current and recent Netflix subscribers from September 9-13th to gauge the impact of the July pricing change as well as the potential effects of the removal of Starz content. Note, our survey was conducted prior to the reduction in 3Q subscriber guidance (on Sep 15) as well as the formation of a separate Qwikster brand for DVDs and video games (on Sep 19). Overall, the survey yielded results that were in-line with recently revised subscriber guidance. Following were the key findings:

- 3Q churn was higher than expected: Of the 1600 survey respondents – including Netflix current subs and subs in the last 3 months - nearly  $39\%$  indicated they were no longer Netflix subscribers. The remaining  $61\%$  were currently subscribers. This mix of current vs. recent subscribers was lower than our expectations prior to launching the survey. In addition,  $67\%$  of users who recently left Netflix cited the pricing changes as the reason for leaving. Though we don't think Netflix's actual churn levels are this high, we believe the results are indicative of the company's recently reduced subscriber guidance due to higher than expected churn. We continue to think that the reduced guidance was due to subscriber churn from the pricing change rather than weakness in gross adds as Netflix's 3Q streaming subscriber guidance was relatively unchanged and the impact was felt in DVDs. Moreover, we note that pricing for the streaming product was unchanged and that  $75 - 80\%$  of gross adds in a regular quarter come from streaming only subscribers.  
- Pricing change awareness was high, though many members had yet to change their plan as of Sep 13: Over  $83\%$  of current Netflix members were aware of the pricing changes announced this summer, though only  $44\%$  of these members indicated they had already changed their plan in reaction to the pricing changes. The number is skewed higher by users who had already churned off and many subs may not move from a hybrid or streaming plan at all, yet there is potentially room for additional churn as hybrid subscribers go through the September billing cycle at a higher price point. This data point in addition to the recent Qwikster rebranding gives us additional reason for conservatism in our 4Q numbers. Of those current Netflix subscribers that were unaware of the price change  $(17\%)$ , roughly  $36\%$  indicated they would switch to streaming only while  $15\%$  indicated they would end their Netflix subscription.  
- Usage of Starz on Netflix appears low, though hard to gauge accurately: When we questioned both current and recent Netflix subscribers on their usage of Starz,  $66\%$  of respondents indicated they never or infrequently watch Starz content on Netflix while  $30\%$  indicated they were not aware that Starz content was available through Netflix. Only  $14\%$  of respondents indicated they watched Starz content frequently. Though these numbers appear low, we believe it's difficult to gauge if users would recognize Starz content even if they were watching it. As a result, we think these numbers may not reflect the actual perceived value of Starz content to Netflix subscribers. Netflix has previously suggested that Starz currently accounts for  $8\%$  of streaming hours and is expected to drift down to  $5 - 6\%$  by the end of the contract in 1Q 2012.
- Newer movies drive new subs, though behavior changes over time: Nearly  $53\%$  of current Netflix subscribers cited new film releases as their primary reason for originally joining Netflix though  $52\%$  indicated that both movies and TV shows/documentsaries were now their primary reason for using Netflix. In our view, consumers may initially be attracted to Netflix's streaming movies and may diversify their usage across TV shows due to Netflix's strong merchandising and recommendation engine.
- Amazon Prime Videos appears to have some recognition: Among both current and recent Netflix members,  $26\%$  indicated they had heard of free videos available on Amazon Prime. Roughly  $17\%$  of the survey sample indicated they were Amazon Prime members, suggesting a disproportionately high  $\%$  of Amazon Prime members using Netflix. We think Amazon Prime likely has less than  $5\%$  of US Internet users. As Amazon Prime continues to add a greater selection of content, it could pose a more significant challenge to Netflix.

# What To Watch For

- Dish Network Announcement: According to Bloomberg, Dish Network which recently acquired Blockbuster is set to announce pricing and other details regarding a new subscription streaming product on Sep 23. In addition, the Bloomberg article notes that Dish's offering is expected to include movies from Starz. We think it is likely the service will initially be bundled with the Dish satellite video service - which had 14MM subscribers as of 2Q11 – though we don't think the service would be competitive until it is opened up to non-Dish Network subscribers.  
- Amazon deepening its subscription video offering: Amazon has been expanding its Prime free video content selection from 5000 low quality titles in February to nearly 9000 titles this summer, including recent deals announced with CBS and NBC Universal. Furthermore, the company's upcoming tablet launch could potentially include an Amazon Prime bundle which could make the service compelling to some consumers.  
- Hulu could become a bigger threat in the hands of a larger company: Per the WSJ (8/21), Hulu's owners are taking bids for the company, and Google has been one of the bidders, though Google itself has said nothing about bidding. Though the bidding process for Hulu which also includes Amazon is far from complete, we think a well-capitalized acquirer could potentially make the service more competitive with Netflix over time. Hulu's CEO has noted he expects the company to have  \$500MM in revenue in 2011 and that Hulu may spend\$ 375MM on content this year. Note that Hulu Plus has recently passed the 1MM paid subscriber mark. We believe Hulu could be very important for Google's display business as we think Google needs more owned & operated (O&O) display inventory to become a much larger player in the space and capture a greater share of net revenue.  
- Facebook integration could help drive international subs: At its F8 conference today, Facebook and Netflix announced an integration to allow Netflix users to view their friends' movie/TV recommendations on Netflix.com while also allowing Facebook users that have a Netflix subscription to view Netflix content through a pop-up Facebook video player. The Facebook integration is currently available only outside the US due to a 1998 US law called the Video Privacy Protection (VPP) Act which requires rental information be kept private. Netflix is currently lobbying for the law to be clarified in the US Congress. The company has mentioned that the Facebook integration is a nice benefit for users though the recent split into two separate streaming and Qwikster operating units without shared queues is not attributable to the integration with Facebook.  
- Additional content deals likely: Netflix recently announced a renewed 2 yr content partnership with Discovery Communications to offer streaming versions of its shows. In addition, last week Time Warner and News Corp executives noted their willingness to sign additional content deals with Netflix. We believe Netflix will likely replace a significant portion of Starz content with additional TV shows and older movies from multiple studios.

# Investment Thesis

Maintain Overweight. Despite lower near-term subscriber expectations, we continue to believe that Netflix's ongoing subscriber migration from DVDs to streaming offers significant financial leverage that Netflix can use to acquire more content and expand overseas. We think there is still considerable room for Netflix in the U.S. market with current penetration at  $\sim 30\%$  of broadband subscribers and revenue at just  $\sim 13\%$  of the home video market. Additionally, we remain bullish on Netflix's international opportunity given the company's track record of execution and there does not appear to be significant international competition.

# Valuation

Our year end 2012 price target moves to \(205 from \)245. Our \$205 PT is based on ~23x our 2013 PF EPS of \(8.89 vs. a 40% 2010-13E EPS CAGR. A 23x multiple is only 0.6x our projected 3 yr growth rate, a significant discount. Our mid and large cap names trade at an avg of 1.1x peg. Our lower multiple (28x previously) takes into account still strong profit growth, but also slower sub growth and less near-term visibility.

# Risks to Rating and Price Target

Netflix stock could perform below expectations if: The company is unable to strike deals with content owners to continue to expand its streaming catalog; Internet Service Providers add more restrictive data usage caps; Other competitors, such as Redbox, Amazon, or Apple are able to offer more attractive customer offerings and thus take market share; The company is not able to manage future postal price increases effectively.
