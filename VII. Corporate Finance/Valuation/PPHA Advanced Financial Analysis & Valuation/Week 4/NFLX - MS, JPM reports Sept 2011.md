## Netflix Inc

### Can Netflix be a leader in this brave new world of content?

Investment conclusion: The competitive environment for consumer video consumption has changed from the days of DVD by mail. Barriers to entry have changed as Netflix's business model evolves; Google and Amazon have emerged as serious, deep-pocketed competitors for content, which will drive mid / long-term content costs higher. We are reducing our estimates and our fair value estimate to \$180 but remain Equal-weight.

Why did Netflix increase prices?: Netflix raised prices to properly monetize its streaming service, which was originally complementary to its DVD by mail offering and was priced as such. With content costs rising, Netflix was forced to better match its revenue and costs. We do not believe the price increases were to drive DVD subs away – quite the contrary, DVD subs now serve an important role in subsidizing streaming content costs.

Why is Netflix separating its businesses?: We believe Netflix is gearing up for a new era where content owners will price content based on "the right to stream", not based on which subs actually stream. By separating the two offerings, Netflix will pay less than if it continued to offer hybrid subscription plans in which hybrid subs have the right to stream but may not choose to do so.

Where we differ: We believe Netflix is facing an uphill battle for premium content as its resources for content acquisition are directly tied to its subscriber base. On the contrary, both Google and Amazon have very different strategic goals with investment objectives that are not directly tied to ARPU rates. As such, we believe Netflix is facing a phase of increasing content costs in which it has few obvious countermeasures.

Valuation: The adverse news flow coincided with an uncertain macro environment, which has likely caused Netflix's multiple to compress too far. We believe, however, that when the smoke clears, Netflix's multiple will be challenged due to increased downside risk to the company's long-term margin profile.

## Investment Case

Historically, Netflix has thrived on the edge of innovation for video content distribution…

The Past: Revolutionized the way Americans consume video content.

In a world where the local video store charged upwards of \(5 per video, per night, Netflix rewrote the rules by providing subscribers an "all you can eat" offering at price points that seemed unsustainable. As the company grew in scale and content agreements were signed, Netflix evolved into a household name, preparing to lead Americans through the next stage of content distribution – streaming.

The Present: Leading the physical to digital transition.

Streaming video has contributed to subscriber growth acceleration when pundits believed the business model had matured. Management's foresight to create ubiquitous access through partnerships with device manufacturers has paid off handsomely. The American household has multiple devices capable of streaming video content; growth in user adoption of Android and Apple iOS devices has also grown mind and wallet share.

Exhibit 1 Netflix has enjoyed two "Golden Eras" of accelerating domestic subscriber growth

The Future: Replicate its strategy in international markets.

Last year, Netflix announced its entrance into the Canadian market, followed by Latin America this year. We suspect that Netflix will also be heading into Western Europe beginning in 2012. Netflix is only offering its streaming subscription in international markets.

…but now the company's business model appears to be facing fundamental challenges.

Incremental subscriber acquisition will be more difficult. While we believe the current domestic subscriber base is fairly sticky, it appears Netflix's ride on the "s-curve" may be hitting the brakes. The sub who sat on the sidelines through the era of the \$9.99 plan now faces an inferior value proposition at \$15.98 for the same content. The only way she converts into a paying sub is if prices decrease (highly unlikely) or content improves (which we argue will come with challenges).

The streaming video business is drawing new competitors into the mix.

There are two competitive forces on the horizon: competitors for subscribers (Blockbuster 2.0) and competitors for content. We are less concerned about the prior but very focused on the latter. In the era of DVDs by mail and fulfillment centers, the barriers to entry were quite high because of Netflix's superior brand equity and the required capital to build a network of fulfillment centers. In the world of video streaming, Google and Amazon have superior content delivery infrastructure and much larger war chests of cash for content acquisition. Neither Google nor Amazon is looking to recreate Netflix or instigate a mass exodus of Netflix's subs; they just want content. The rising content costs for Netflix are merely collateral damage – something the company has little control over.

Quantity of content is limited and quality of content is even more so.

We believe Netflix has and will continue to develop a best in class TV content portfolio. With uncertainty surrounding the Starz contract renegotiation, however, Netflix risks losing a material amount of its output film content. The greater concern, however, is that even though Netflix will have considerable resources to acquire content, the company will not be able to replace the quality of the lost film content.

Subscribers want value, which limits Netflix's pricing power.

With looming content cost increases, Netflix must double-down on its commitment to its most valuable asset, its subscriber base. The company can ill afford to have additional attrition. We believe the company will undergo a brand rebuilding phase over the next 18 months where it must prove that it still has the best value proposition in town. This consumer value imperative limits Netflix's pricing power, thus forcing the company to go all-in on its plans for international expansion.

### Debate 1: "Virtuous Cycle Lives" or "Vicious Spiral Looms"?

#### Netflix's "Virtuous Cycle" in the US is experiencing pressure and risks impairment.

##### Lower quality content…

##### …less value…

##### …fewer subscribers…

##### …less money to acquire content. Repeat.

### Debate 2: How is Netflix positioned for the Content Wars?

#### Content is a key part of the "Virtuous Cycle".

#### The Starz press release is a material uncertainty with potentially very negative consequences.

#### Comprehensive negotiations with studios for output film content are not possible (at least for now).

#### Amazon and Google are in the battle for content, not subs.

#### Scale matters, and Netflix may not be large enough.

### Debate 3: Is international expansion the third "S-Curve"?

#### Innovation is at the heart of the company's DNA.

#### Precedents suggest Netflix will be successful internationally.

#### "It ain't cheap."

#### To succeed, Netflix must narrow its field of competitors.

One of the toughest challenges Netflix will face is the presence of incumbent competition. Depending upon price points, competition may be cable TV plans. Netflix management has always spoken of its streaming offering as a complementary service to the cable box. It appears, however, that Netflix has priced its streaming service at a high point, relative to basic cable when compared to the US. The higher the percentage of the basic cable package, the better the content has to be or in the worst case, the lower the adoption level.

Exhibit 5 With the exception of Brazil, Netflix's LatAm pricing is higher than the US, relative to basic cable TV

Opportunity cost of purchasing power cannot be ignored. In terms of value, based on purchasing power, the prices across the large Latin American countries are higher than the US. We believe these price points will narrow the TAM as fewer people have the disposable income to purchase a subscription.

Exhibit 6 On a purchasing power parity basis, Netflix's LatAm pricing is more expensive than the US

### Accelerated Transition To Streaming Creates Near Term Uncertainty, But Growth Story To Return In 2012

Despite adjusting numbers last week, we are again lowering our 3Q (now below revised guidance), 4Q and 2012 estimates on Netflix due to the company's pricing changes and recent Qwikster rebranding announcement. As a result, we are also reducing our price target to  \$205 from\$ 245 though our rating remains Overweight. We recognize the near term challenges for Netflix, but expect growth to return in 2012. Over time we expect Netflix to become more profitable as Qwikster is run more for profit than growth while streaming subscriber growth continues.

- Lower ests. primarily due to lower hybrid subs. We are lowering our domestic hybrid subscriber numbers for 3Q, 4Q, 2012 and now project 23.7MM, 24.1MM, and 31.6MM total US subscribers respectively. However, we are raising our int'l sub ests. based on our new bottom-up analysis of broadband subs by country (see pg 6). We now project 4.9MM/9.9MM int'l subs by the end of 2012/13 respectively. Though we have reduced our 2012 GAAP EPS est. to \$5.62, we are raising our 2013 est. slightly as the DVD business is run for profit.  
- Near term sentiment to remain weak but story to improve in 4Q/2012. Netflix could remain range bound in the near term due to negative news flow from potential competitor announcements (Dish, Amazon, Hulu) and continued disruption from headlines regarding sub churn. However, we think sentiment will improve in 4Q as NFLX signs more content deals and announces new int'l launches, and we expect churn to normalize in 2012.  
- Proprietary survey showed elevated churn. Our prop survey of 1600 current and recent Netflix subs conducted prior to the guidance revision (Sep 9-13) showed elevated levels of churn inline with the company's revised guidance. In addition, the survey showed a high degree of awareness of the pricing change while awareness of Starz content on Netflix was low (see pg 10 for more details).  
- Valuation. Our \$205 YE 2012 price target on NFLX is based on 23x our 2013 PF EPS of \$8.89 vs. a 40% 2010-13E EPS CAGR.

Netflix stock could perform below expectations if: The company is unable to strike deals with content owners to continue to expand its streaming catalog; Internet Service Providers add more restrictive data usage caps; Other competitors, such as Redbox, Amazon, or Apple are able to offer more attractive customer offerings and thus take market share; The company is not able to manage future postal price increases effectively.
