## Employee Stock Options

## Theory and Practice

## Corporate Governance

Intelligent capital allocation is a management team's core responsibility. How a company allocates capital often relates directly to management's incentives. A company's corporate governance policy can often provide good insight into how managers will likely behave.<sup>2</sup>

Good corporate governance, in our opinion, boils down to two things. First is a company's ability to reduce, and ideally eliminate, agency costs. These costs arise when agents (managers) run a company in ways beneficial to themselves instead of the owners (shareholders). For instance, many mergers benefit managers by increasing firm size, and consequently executive pay, at the expense of shareholder value. Well-structured company policies should serve to align the interests of managers and shareholders.

Second, incentives must be consistent with economic value creation. Corporations frequently and unwittingly employ incentives they believe are consistent with creating wealth but which fail the value creation test. One prominent example is managing a company for earnings per share growth. A company must generate returns above the cost of capital in order to create value. But a company can still grow earnings while generating returns below the cost of capital. As a result, earnings growth can increase, decrease, or be irrelevant for shareholder value.

We choose corporate governance as a primary focus because it relates directly to economic performance. A recent academic study of about 1,500 companies showed firms with the best governance policies generated substantial excess shareholders returns, grew faster, and invested more judiciously than companies with less favorable governance profiles.<sup>3</sup>

Employee stock options (ESOs) have been a contentious issue in recent years. While only one facet of an overall governance policy, ESOs nonetheless encapsulate many of governance's challenges, including a company's compensation philosophy and financial disclosure policy.

This report addresses a number of questions:

What is an appropriate philosophy regarding ESOs?  
How large an issue are ESOs?  
What is the proper accounting treatment for ESOs?  

- How broadly should companies grant options within an organization?  
What's the best way to treat ESOs in a valuation model?

## Conclusion

Incentive is defined as what motivates behavior. Long-term shareholders must look for proper incentives. Governance policies often play a major role in shaping corporate executive behavior—for both the good and the bad.
