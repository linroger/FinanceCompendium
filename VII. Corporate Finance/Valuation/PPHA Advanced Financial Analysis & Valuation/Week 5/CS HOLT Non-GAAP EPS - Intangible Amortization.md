# Introduction

There is a large and growing spread between GAAP and Non-GAAP EPS, as shown in Exhibit 1. Although the reasons for Non-GAAP adjustments can vary by company (e.g., amortization, tax reform, stock compensation), the add-back of acquired intangible amortization is often the largest adjustment and creates comparability issues. Based on our discussions with investors, there is a general level of confusion surrounding the magnitude and rationale behind Non-GAAP adjustments, particularly for intangible amortization. Accordingly, this report will analyze the accounting rules, economics, and potential distortions associated with this Non-GAAP adjustment.

# Key Points

- 82% of the largest 500 U.S. companies reported Non-GAAP EPS in 2018. Intangible-related adjustments (amortization and impairments) are often the largest driver.  
- The accounting rules for intangibles are a breeding ground for potential distortions, leading to an increase in Non-GAAP adjustments.  
- The economics behind the Non-GAAP adjustment for intangible amortization need to be challenged more by investors. We present key investor considerations and a flowchart to help investors analyze this Non-GAAP adjustment.  
- The comparability of investor metrics such as EPS, P/E ratios and management compensation metrics can be distorted given the inconsistent and sometimes questionable add-back of intangible amortization to Non-GAAP EPS. A cash flow-based model like HOLT can help investors cut through the noise.

Based on the review of 50 companies in this sample, there were 186 specific adjustments totaling \$116B! Intangible related adjustments (amortization and impairments) accounted for ~64% of all Non-GAAP adjustments.

# Non-GAAP EPS Adjustments

# Intangible Amortization Is Leading the Way

Last year,  $82\%$  of the largest 500 U.S. companies reported Non-GAAP EPS. Exhibit 2 provides an illustration of the largest Non-GAAP adjustments based on a review (hand collection) of 50 sample companies. As shown, intangible-related adjustments (amortization and impairments) accounted for  $\sim 64\%$  of all Non-GAAP adjustments (before tax).

# Could the FASB be planning to change the accounting rules for Intangibles again?

As the economy has become even more intangible based and as M&A has surged, so have the accounting distortions. Some argue the accounting rules have not kept up. Changes could be on the way as the FASB recently added the Subsequent Accounting for Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets to its 2019 Technical Agenda and is seeking stakeholder comments on issues such as amortizing goodwill (again!) and modifying the recognition of intangible assets in a business combination. We hope they read this paper!

Although the FASB is trying to address this issue, we still do not see enough commentary surrounding what we believe is one of the root causes of this accounting mess—the difference in accounting for internally (expensed) vs. acquired intangible assets (capitalized at fair value).

# Blame It on the Accounting Rules?

For a better understanding of the origins of the intangible amortization Non-GAAP adjustment, an overview of the evolving accounting rules for intangibles is required. Exhibit 4 provides a brief summary and timeline.

In order to fully appreciate how the accounting rules could be partially responsible for an explosion in intangible assets and Non-GAAP adjustments, some additional detail is required. To elaborate, prior to 2001, companies had a choice between two methods on how to account for an acquisition:²

1. The Pooling-of-Interests Method: The acquiree's as-stated assets were simply merged onto the acquirer's balance sheet. There was no requirement to recognize intangible assets or goodwill, therefore no amortization.  
2. The Purchase Method: The acquirer recorded the "fair value" of all tangible assets (e.g., PP&E), intangible assets (e.g., patents, trademarks, customer lists) and liabilities assumed, which depending on the purchase price, could result in the recognition of goodwill. All intangibles, including goodwill, were deemed "wasting" assets and amortized over a period of up to 40 years.

Then two large accounting changes took effect in 2001, which had a material impact on the way companies account for M&A and acquired intangibles:

FAS 141 (Business Combinations) eliminated the Pooling-of-Interest Method and required the Purchase Method. As shown in Exhibit 5, goodwill and intangibles have significantly increased since this accounting rule changed and now make up over  $35\%$  of total assets!

# What about Internally Generated Intangible Assets

Long story short, the fair value of most internally generated intangible assets (e.g., Trademarks, Customer Lists, Patents) is not recognized on the balance sheet. Only certain direct costs associated with securing an internally developed intangible asset such as legal, registration and consulting fees are capitalized. The rest are expensed within SG&A and R&D.

This creates distortions between.   
acquisitive and non-acquisitive   
companies and is one of the root   
drivers of the Non-GAAP adjustment   
for acquired intangible amortization.

For more on the balance sheet impacts of intangible assets please see: HOLT: Intangible Capital. Tom Hillman. March, 2019.

FAS 142 (Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets) changed the post-acquisition accounting for acquired intangible assets. It requires acquired intangible assets with finite lives (e.g., customer lists/relationships, patents) to be amortized over their estimated useful life; goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives (e.g., brand, licenses) are not required to be amortized, but reviewed for impairment.

To summarize, these accounting changes forced more companies to recognize the fair value of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination and changed the type of acquired intangible assets subject to amortization. As shown in Exhibit 6, since the accounting rules for intangibles changed in 2001, annual amortization expense has reset (not to include goodwill) and subsequently increased back to  $15\%$  of net income.

Universe: U.S. Largest 500 companies by market capitalization (ex Financials, Real Estate, and Reg Utilities). 1: Note that the periods 2000 - 2001 in this exhibit were impacted by several large acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting subject to amortization and depressed net income. Post FAS 142 in 2001, these intangibles (e.g., goodwill) were no longer amortized resulting in the drop-off shown in this chart.

# The Economics Could Be Lost in the Accounting Confusion

So why do companies/analysts add back acquired intangible amortization, but do not add back depreciation to Non-GAAP EPS? After all, the rules for amortization of intangible assets are similar to the depreciation rules for tangible assets like PP&E - compute the amortization/depreciation expense based on an estimated useful life and report it as a deduction to net income.<sup>3</sup> This is Accounting 101 (matching principle) where the costs of an asset are allocated over the expected periods of benefit/earnings. (See Appendix II for more on the intangible asset life).

Despite the similarities, companies, sell-side research and investors have collectively decided the periodic costs associated with the purchase of intangible assets (amortization) should be treated very differently than the periodic costs associated with tangible assets (depreciation).

From an economic perspective, depreciation is not added back to EPS as it serves as a proxy for maintenance (replacement) capex required to generate earnings. However, even though the accounting rules also deem that certain acquired intangibles ( e.g., customer lists/relationships, patents, technology) are wasting assets that should be amortized, just about every company and analyst disagree and continue to add back acquired intangible amortization as a Non-GAAP adjustment. Most companies/analysts make the argument that amortization can distort GAAP EPS for the following reasons:

i. Amortization is not a recurring cost—specifically related to a one-off acquisition of an intangible asset that will not be replaced.  
ii. Including amortization expense as part of EPS could be double counting, as the company is already accounting for this expense as part of its ongoing R&D, SG&A. In other words, treat the acquired intangible as if it were internally generated, no need to amortize.  
iii. Amortization expense associated with the purchase price allocated to acquired intangible assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost the company would incur to internally develop the intangible asset.

These are valid reasons that make economic sense. However, in our opinion and based on investor discussions, the underlying assumptions supporting the Non-GAAP adjustments for intangible amortization are not challenged enough. Here are some important considerations:

- Is it realistic to assume that every acquired intangible asset does not need to be replaced or will be perfectly replenished via internal SG&A/R&D spend (particularly for companies in a rapidly changing business environment)?  
- Do investors have a solid understanding of how much internal SG&A/R&D spend is required to replace the acquired intangible assets?  
- Why do some companies repeatedly pay a premium to acquire intangibles (e.g., serial acquirers) if they are spending enough to "internally" generate a similar type of intangible asset?  
- Should investors hold the management team accountable for the cost paid to acquire intangible assets as an ongoing cost incorporated into EPS?  
- Are investors adjusting their metrics for those companies that have acquired intangible amortization but choose to not add back amortization to EPS?

Common reasons for adding back acquired intangible amortization to Non-GAAP EPS.

Important questions for investors to consider before making a Non-GAAP adjustment for acquired intangible amortization to EPS.

# What Are Companies Saying About Non-GAAP Adjustment for Acquired Intangible Amortization?

Based on our analysis of company filings, most of the disclosure about the NongAAP adjustment for acquired amortization is boilerplate. However, as shown below in Exhibit 7, Pfizer (PFE) provides one of the best disclosures on this topic we could find.

Exhibit 7: In Their Own Words—Pfizer (PFE)

Why

Companies Adjust Non-GAAP EPS for Intangible Amortization

Pfizer (PFE) provides a clear explanation why they adjust Non-GAAP income for intangible amortization, but even more importantly, provide some reasons for investors to challenge this adjustment!

# Company Example: Pfizer (PFE)

We believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which R&D costs previously have been expensed. However, a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through Adjusted income…. We have not factored in the impacts of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. For example, our R&D costs in total, and in the periods presented; our speed to commercialization and resulting sales… costs to manufacture may have (all) been different…. As such, in total, there can be no assurance that our Adjusted income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.

Several years ago, Warren Buffett acknowledged that some intangible assets are wasting assets and the related amortization should be included. However, Buffett also stated that the amortization expense associated with certain acquired intangible assets such as customer lists should not be included in EPS. Hard to argue with Warren Buffett…but shouldn't we challenge Berkshire's assumptions that the premium paid to acquire the \$28B in acquired Customer List Intangibles on its balance sheet does not lose value? Are they adequately spending to maintain/replenish them in a rapidly changing business (consumer preferences) environment? Could amortization be a better proxy for that ongoing cost?

Exhibit 8: In Their Own Words—Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)

Why Companies Adjust Non-GAAP EPS for Intangible Amortization

Warren Buffett believes only certain intangible amortization costs should be included in EPS.

# Company Example: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK)

Amortization charges of \$1.1 billion have been deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these "real," the rest not….I suggest that you ignore a portion of GAAP amortization costs (primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets)…Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits. I won't explain all of the adjustments (Non-GAAP) - some are tiny and arcane - but serious investors should understand the disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete in value over time, while others in no way lose value. For software, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Conversely, the concept of recording charges against other intangibles, such as customer relationships, arises from purchase-accounting rules and clearly does not reflect economic reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated - even though, from an investor's viewpoint, they could not differ more.

# Investor Impacts: EPS, P/E Ratios, Management Compensation

Given Non-GAAP EPS is reported by  $82\%$  of largest 500 U.S. companies, the choice on how to treat intangible amortization can have a material impact on the comparability of commonly used metrics such EPS and P/E ratios. Exhibit 9 illustrates the impact of the Non-GAAP adjustment for intangible amortization on EPS by sector.

Note: Intangible amortization boost to Non-GAAP EPS is a HOLT estimate calculated by dividing the estimated after-tax amortization impact on EPS by the spread between GAAP and Non-GAAP EPS.

This Non-GAAP adjustment also can lead to valuation discrepancies. For example, P/E ratios can result in different answers depending on the treatment of amortization. Given the impact of intangible amortization within the Health Care sector, Exhibit 10 provides a time series of the P/E ratio with and without amortization expense.

Note: P/E with amortization expensed is a HOLT estimate calculated by subtracting the estimated after-tax amortization expense per share from reported Non-GAAP EPS. The P/E amortization added back is based on consensus Non-GAAP earnings.

This chart shows the distribution of intangible amortization impact on Non-GAAP EPS by sector.

The black line in the gray bar is the median (50th percentile) impact, while the gray bar is the range of impact between the  $25^{\text{th}}$  and  $75^{\text{th}}$  percentile. The greater the median and range, the more the sector's Non-GAAP EPS is generally impacted by intangible amortization. For example, the median impact on Non-GAAP EPS for the Health Care sector is  $28\%$ .

The Health Care Sector P/E ratio increased by  $17\%$  in 2018 if intangible amortization was expensed.

It also can be difficult for investors to compare metrics across individual companies within the same industry or sector. For example, based on our analysis of the largest 500 U.S. companies, there are  $\sim 100$  companies that have an intangible amortization expense, but do not include it as a Non-GAAP adjustment. Exhibit 11 is an illustration of companies that are in the same sector, but treat amortization differently in the reported EPS. Although materiality likely plays a role, it still raises the question about intangible amortization: to expense or not to expense?

This is not an exclusive list. Eastman Chemical reports Non-GAAP EPS, but does not add back amortization. Amortization expense/share is an after-tax estimate based on reported amortization expense and HOLT's normalized tax rate. All data is based on LFY.

In addition, do not forget management compensation can be tied to EPS…Non-GAAP most of the time. In 2018,  $21\%$  of U.S. companies listed EPS as one of the metrics used to rate and reward management for both short-term and long-term performance. EPS, frequently defined as adjusted/Non-GAAP EPS, was the third most common metric used in long-term management compensation. Using Non-GAAP EPS as a compensation metric for management can misalign CEO and investor interests, particularly if the reasoning behind the Non-GAAP adjustments is not carefully flushed out. For example, management may favor acquisition growth (add back amortization to Non GAAP EPS) vs. growing organically (e.g., Capex, R&D) where the related expenses are not added back to EPS.

# What Should Investors Do with Intangible Amortization?

The ultimate solution is to replace EPS with an adjusted operating cash flow amount (e.g., HOLT's adjusted cash flow or EBITDA), which adds back all non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization. However, given Non-GAAP EPS is the input for some of the most widely used investor metrics (EPS Growth, P/E ratios), another solution is needed.

Unfortunately, when it comes to EPS, there is no easy answer. The current treatment to add back all intangible amortization to EPS could be too generous in some situations; expensing all the amortization could be too punitive. In reality it depends, and the flowchart in Exhibit 13 provides a framework for investors to begin to challenge the underlying assumptions around the treatment of intangible amortization in regards to EPS.

As a hypothetical example of the above flowchart, consider McKesson (MCK) from Exhibit 11. As of its last filing,  $22\%$  of the company's book assets are intangibles. It reported a \$485M Non-GAAP adjustment to EPS for amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets in the form of Customer Relationships, Service Agreement, Pharmacy Licenses, Trademarks and Technology. Per the company's filing, they note significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments are required to determine the fair value of acquired intangible assets and the useful life, which ranges from one to 38 years. This is a common type of disclosure for companies with intangibles and highlights an important issue: The fair value and subsequent amortization of intangible assets are subject to significant estimates/judgments that can vary by company. In fact, based on our review of company disclosures, amortization periods can range from one year to indefinite. (See Appendix II)

Given most companies are adding back amortization it is unlikely these assumptions are being adequately challenged. This could be an important step to determine how much internal spend is actually required to maintain/replace these assets, provide investors with a better earnings forecast, and improve the ability to make comparisons across companies.

The treatment of acquired intangible amortization within EPS is more of an art than science…but this flowchart can help investors begin to challenge the assumptions. This also may require investors to push companies for more disclosure on this topic.

Again, the best solution is to use an adjusted cash flow as the input to investor operating and valuation metrics. However, given the widespread use of EPS, the above flowchart can at least help investors begin to challenge company assumptions regarding this large Non-GAAP adjustment and ultimately lead to better forecasts of EPS.

# Final Points and How HOLT Can Help

Unfortunately, there is no simple solution for investors to reverse the accounting impacts of intangibles on EPS. However, this report provides investors the insights and framework to challenge this Non-GAAP adjustment.

As previously mentioned, using a cash flow based model is the best way to cut through the noise created by the sometimes questionable and inconsistent treatment of intangible amortization within EPS. The HOLT framework serves as an excellent example as it makes adjustments to preserve the operating return of companies undergoing a business combination by removing intangible accounting distortions. Specifically, HOLT adds back all non-cash expenses including amortization and adjusts its asset base by capitalizing R&D and removing non-operating intangibles (i.e., goodwill). This consistent treatment of all non-cash expenses prevents comparability distortions (GAAP vs. Non-GAAP). More importantly the capitalization of R&D and removal of non-operating intangibles enables HOLT to estimate the total required investments needed to generate cash flows, regardless if the investment is tangible or intangible.

To summarize, the benefit of HOLT is that the inputs (cash flows and assets) to the CFROI are adjusted for intangible distortions. This translates into cleaner metrics of corporate performance and valuation, which can lead to different answers compared to traditional metrics. As an illustration, click below for a screen to HOLT Lens where we show companies with exposure to Intangibles/Non-GAAP that look cheap on traditional P/E ratios, but expensive on HOLT adjusted Economic P/E ratios: Link to screen in HOLT Lens

Appendix I: Non-GAAP EPS Q&A

# What are Non-GAAP Earnings?

Non-GAAP earnings are adjusted for both 1) recurring special items such as acquired intangible amortization, pensions and stock compensation expense, FX; 2) nonrecurring special items such as U.S. Tax Reform charges, impairments, the impact of adopting new accounting rules and restructuring charges.

# Why do special items increase in frequency during the fourth quarter?

Firms are required to make year-end valuations of important items such as pensions, goodwill, and fixed assets that can lead to an increase in special charges during the  $4^{\text{th}}$  quarter.

# Are Non-GAAP earnings not a better representation of the underlying economics?

It depends. Non-GAAP adjustments are required in some situations. For example, when US Tax Reform passed in December of 2017, companies reported large one off nonrecurring charges for the revaluation of deferred taxes and repatriation tax that were appropriately reversed as Non-GAAP.

Unfortunately, there is not enough regulation/oversight on what a company can and cannot include. Yes, most companies provide great tables and disclosure, however, the magnitude of certain Non-GAAP items is growing (i.e., the treatment of acquired intangible amortization as a Non-GAAP adjustment has surged in recent years). These adjustments also can vary across time and companies, making it difficult to unwind while distorting comparisons. Finally, Non-GAAP Earnings can end up closer to operating cash flows, but should not be viewed as a substitute.

# Is Non-GAAP audited/regulated?

Although Non-GAAP is commonly found in a company's earnings releases (e.g., 8K), annual /quarterly filings (e.g., 10K, 10Q), it is not subject to an audit. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sets the rules and regulations on the use of Non-GAAP financial measures and can impose enforcements against companies. These rules were last updated by the SEC in May, 2016. To summarize, the SEC would like companies to avoid using Non-GAAP measures that are misleading, too prominent, inconsistent or low quality (i.e., adding back recurring cash charges), and not make adjustments to revenue (i.e., accelerate the recognition of deferred revenue).

# Why do Non-GAAP adjustments matter?

Non-GAAP EPS is commonly provided by company management teams and used by the investment community as the input for widely followed metrics such as EPS growth and P/E ratios. Prior HOLT studies and analysis of individual companies have found that Non-GAAP adjustment/special items can be addictive, lead to negative EPS surprises, and share price underperformance. A better understanding of these adjustments can lead to better EPS forecasts.

# Appendix II: Intangible Asset Life and Amortization

There are three categories of acquired intangible assets per the current accounting rules:

NaN. Goodwill not amortized but reviewed for impairment.  
NaN. Non-Goodwill indefinite-lived intangibles (e.g., brand, licenses, and trademarks) are not amortized but reviewed for impairment.  
NaN. Non-Goodwill finite-lived intangibles (e.g., technology/patents, customer lists/relationships, trademarks) that are amortized over an estimated useful life.

- Given the complexity around identifying and valuing intangible assets, it probably should not be a surprise that the life assigned and used to amortize an acquired intangible asset can also be subject to some questions and distortions. For example, one company we looked at said the following about its treatment of intangible assets: "Our intangible assets are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to 38 years." We found other examples of companies using accelerated lives of 4 years to amortize all their intangibles.  
- In fact, the SEC has sent letters to several companies about how they determine the lives of their acquired intangibles. Specific inquiries by the SEC include questions about the lives assigned to acquired customer relationships, which ranges from three to thirty years for one company and indefinite (non-amortizing) at another company.  
- The intangible asset life can significantly impact GAAP EPS; however, given most companies add it back as part of Non-GAAP, this appears to flow under the investor radar screen.

# Appendix III: What Are the Tax Implications of Intangible Amortization?

The short answer is that in isolation, the type of intangible asset and associated amortization can have an impact on taxes; however, it is highly complex issue that interacts with multiple other elements associated with structuring an acquisition, which is outside the scope of this paper, but here is a brief summary.

- The accounting rules require that a company record the "fair value" of all assets and liabilities assumed as part of an acquisition, including intangible assets that were not previously reported on the target's books. However for tax purposes, there are different impacts depending on the type of acquisition (i.e., "Stock" vs. "Asset" purchase).  
- Under the "asset" type purchase, assets are stepped up to FMV for tax purposes and the goodwill/other intangibles are tax deductible and amortized over 15 years. This will result in lower cash taxes. However, it is difficult to view the impact in isolation as the "asset" type purchase can have many other impacts on taxes.  
In a "stock" type purchase goodwill/other intangibles are not tax deductible. The tax basis of acquired intangibles is zero. As such a deferred tax liability (DTL) is recognized for differences between the new accounting book value (now at FMV) and tax basis of certain acquired intangible assets. DTLs represent a future taxable amount and most eventually reverse overtime (over the book life), but for indefinite-lived intangibles they can stay on the books until sold.

# Valuation Methodology and Risks

The HOLT methodology does not assign ratings or a target price to a security. It is an analytical tool that involves use of a set of proprietary quantitative algorithms and warranted value calculations, collectively called the HOLT valuation model, that are consistently applied to all the companies included in its database. The HOLT valuation model is a discounted cash flow model. Third-party data (including consensus earnings estimates) are systematically translated into a number of default variables and incorporated into the algorithms available in the HOLT valuation model. The source financial statement, pricing, and earnings data provided by outside data vendors are subject to quality control and may also be adjusted to more closely measure the underlying economics of firm performance. These adjustments provide consistency when analyzing a single company across time, or analyzing multiple companies across industries or national borders.

The default scenario that is produced by the HOLT valuation model establishes a warranted price that represents the expected mean value for a security based upon empirically derived fade algorithms that forecast a firms future return on capital and growth rates over an extended period of time. As the third-party data are updated, the warranted price updates automatically. A company's future achieved return on capital or growth rate may differ from HOLT default forecast. Additional information about the HOLT methodology is available upon request.

The price, value of and income from any of the securities or financial instruments mentioned in this report can fall as well as rise. The value of securities and financial instruments is subject to exchange rate fluctuation that may have a positive or adverse effect on the price or income of such securities or financial instruments. Investors in securities such as ADR's, the values of which are influenced by currency volatility, effectively assume this risk. Structured securities are complex instruments, typically involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale only to sophisticated investors who are capable of understanding and assuming the risks involved. The market value of any structured security may be affected by changes in economic, financial and political factors (including, but not limited to, spot and forward interest and exchange rates), time to maturity, market conditions and volatility, and the credit quality of any issuer or reference issuer. Any investor interested in purchasing a structured product should conduct their own investigation and analysis of the product and consult with their own professional advisers as to the risks involved in making such a purchase. Some investments discussed in this report may have a high level of volatility. High volatility investments may experience sudden and large falls in their value causing losses when that investment is realised. Those losses may equal your original investment. Indeed, in the case of some investments the potential losses may exceed the amount of initial investment and, in such circumstances, you may be required to pay more money to support those losses. Income yields from investments may fluctuate and, in consequence, initial capital paid to make the investment may be used as part of that income yield. Some investments may not be readily realisable and it may be difficult to sell or realise those investments, similarly it may prove difficult for you to obtain reliable information about the value, or risks, to which such an investment is exposed.
