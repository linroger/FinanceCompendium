### Intangible Amortization Is Leading the Way

Last year,  $82\%$  of the largest 500 U.S. companies reported Non-GAAP EPS. Exhibit 2 provides an illustration of the largest Non-GAAP adjustments based on a review (hand collection) of 50 sample companies. As shown, intangible-related adjustments (amortization and impairments) accounted for  $\sim 64\%$  of all Non-GAAP adjustments (before tax).

All data is based on last fiscal year reported and primarily pre-tax.

As a further illustration of the intangible amortization impact, Exhibit 3 is a screen of companies with the largest spread between Non-GAAP vs. GAAP EPS. Intangible amortization accounted for a  $44\%$  average increase in Non-GAAP EPS for the companies shown in Exhibit 3.

### Could the FASB be planning to change the accounting rules for Intangibles again?

### Blame It on the Accounting Rules?

### What about Internally Generated Intangible Assets

### The Economics Could Be Lost in the Accounting Confusion

So why do companies/analysts add back acquired intangible amortization, but do not add back depreciation to Non-GAAP EPS? After all, the rules for amortization of intangible assets are similar to the depreciation rules for tangible assets like PP&E - compute the amortization/depreciation expense based on an estimated useful life and report it as a deduction to net income.<sup>3</sup> This is Accounting 101 (matching principle) where the costs of an asset are allocated over the expected periods of benefit/earnings. (See Appendix II for more on the intangible asset life).

Despite the similarities, companies, sell-side research and investors have collectively decided the periodic costs associated with the purchase of intangible assets (amortization) should be treated very differently than the periodic costs associated with tangible assets (depreciation).

From an economic perspective, depreciation is not added back to EPS as it serves as a proxy for maintenance (replacement) capex required to generate earnings. However, even though the accounting rules also deem that certain acquired intangibles ( e.g., customer lists/relationships, patents, technology) are wasting assets that should be amortized, just about every company and analyst disagree and continue to add back acquired intangible amortization as a Non-GAAP adjustment. Most companies/analysts make the argument that amortization can distort GAAP EPS for the following reasons:

i. Amortization is not a recurring cost—specifically related to a one-off acquisition of an intangible asset that will not be replaced.  
ii. Including amortization expense as part of EPS could be double counting, as the company is already accounting for this expense as part of its ongoing R&D, SG&A. In other words, treat the acquired intangible as if it were internally generated, no need to amortize.  
iii. Amortization expense associated with the purchase price allocated to acquired intangible assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost the company would incur to internally develop the intangible asset.

These are valid reasons that make economic sense. However, in our opinion and based on investor discussions, the underlying assumptions supporting the Non-GAAP adjustments for intangible amortization are not challenged enough. Here are some important considerations:

- Is it realistic to assume that every acquired intangible asset does not need to be replaced or will be perfectly replenished via internal SG&A/R&D spend (particularly for companies in a rapidly changing business environment)?  
- Do investors have a solid understanding of how much internal SG&A/R&D spend is required to replace the acquired intangible assets?  
- Why do some companies repeatedly pay a premium to acquire intangibles (e.g., serial acquirers) if they are spending enough to "internally" generate a similar type of intangible asset?  
- Should investors hold the management team accountable for the cost paid to acquire intangible assets as an ongoing cost incorporated into EPS?  
- Are investors adjusting their metrics for those companies that have acquired intangible amortization but choose to not add back amortization to EPS?

Common reasons for adding back acquired intangible amortization to Non-GAAP EPS.

### What Are Companies Saying About Non-GAAP Adjustment for Acquired Intangible Amortization?

#### Company Example: Pfizer (PFE)

#### Company Example: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK)

#### Investor Impacts: EPS, P/E Ratios, Management Compensation

### Final Points and How HOLT Can Help

Unfortunately, there is no simple solution for investors to reverse the accounting impacts of intangibles on EPS. However, this report provides investors the insights and framework to challenge this Non-GAAP adjustment.

As previously mentioned, using a cash flow based model is the best way to cut through the noise created by the sometimes questionable and inconsistent treatment of intangible amortization within EPS. The HOLT framework serves as an excellent example as it makes adjustments to preserve the operating return of companies undergoing a business combination by removing intangible accounting distortions. Specifically, HOLT adds back all non-cash expenses including amortization and adjusts its asset base by capitalizing R&D and removing non-operating intangibles (i.e., goodwill). This consistent treatment of all non-cash expenses prevents comparability distortions (GAAP vs. Non-GAAP). More importantly the capitalization of R&D and removal of non-operating intangibles enables HOLT to estimate the total required investments needed to generate cash flows, regardless if the investment is tangible or intangible.

To summarize, the benefit of HOLT is that the inputs (cash flows and assets) to the CFROI are adjusted for intangible distortions. This translates into cleaner metrics of corporate performance and valuation, which can lead to different answers compared to traditional metrics.
