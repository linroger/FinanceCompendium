We study the determinants of value creation in U.S. commercial banks. We develop novel measures of individual banks' productivities at collecting deposits and making loans that we relate to bank market values. We find that deposit productivity is responsible for two-thirds of the value of the median bank and most variation in value across banks. Variation in productivity is driven by differences across banks in technology, customer demographics, and market power. We also find evidence of synergies between deposit-taking and lending. Our findings suggest that there is significant heterogeneity in banks' ability to capture value by manufacturing safe assets. (JEL G21)

Raising deposits and making loans are the central activities of banks. But how important is each activity to the business of banking, and what drives variation in the answer across banks? How much of a bank's value comes from its ability to issue information-insensitive deposits to consumers who value such debt? And how much comes from its ability to screen and monitor borrowers?

In this paper, we systematically examine the cross-section of banks to understand the quantitative contributions of deposit-taking and lending to bank value. We begin by developing an economic framework in which banks have two divisions: (1) a deposit-producing division that raises funds by offering consumers services and interest payments, and (2) a revenue-producing division that takes funding as an input and converts it into risk-adjusted revenue by making loans and holding securities. We focus on the traditional banking activities of deposit taking and lending, rather than on nontraditional banking activities like investment banking, trading, and private wealth management, because the banks in our sample are largely traditional banks.<sup>1</sup> We then use tools from industrial organization to construct novel estimates of a bank's productivity in each division in a manner analogous to the literature on the productivity of nonfinancial firms. Our framework therefore allows us to estimate "primitive" measures of deposit productivity and asset productivity for each bank at each point in time.

Intuitively, a bank with high deposit productivity is able to collect more deposits than a less productive bank, holding fixed the "inputs" it uses to collect those deposits, such as its deposit rate and number of branches. For example, according to the Call Reports, BB&T and SunTrust each had about \$150 billion of deposits in 2015Q4, and they paid similar deposit rates. However, SunTrust generated its deposits with  $23\%$  fewer branches. Thus, our measures label SunTrust the more deposit-productive bank, since it generated the same number of deposits with fewer inputs. Analogously, a bank with higher asset productivity is able to generate more risk-adjusted revenue with the same asset base. For example, given similar asset bases of approximately \$200 billion, BB&T generated more revenue from traditional banking activities than SunTrust in 2015Q4 despite having lower levels of observable risk. Thus, our measures label BB&T as the more asset-productive bank.

To estimate how productive a bank is at raising deposits, we construct a consumer demand system for deposits that builds upon existing work by Dick (2008), Egan, Hortaçsu, and Matvos (2017), and Xiao (2020). In our framework, banks compete for deposits by setting interest rates in a standard Bertrand-Nash differentiated products setting, which we estimate using a common model of demand from the industrial organization literature (Berry 1994; Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes 1995). A bank with higher deposit productivity faces a consumer deposit demand curve that is shifted up, meaning it can raise more deposits, holding fixed the deposit services and interest rates it offers. To estimate a bank's asset productivity, we flexibly estimate its ability to produce interest and fee income as a function of the size of its loan

and securities portfolios. Higher asset productivity allows a bank to produce more risk-adjusted income, holding fixed the size of its portfolio. Thus, our estimation procedure allows us to construct two complementary measures of bank productivity at the bank-quarter level that capture a bank's skill at raising deposits and its skill at using these funds to generate revenue.

Uncovering these primitive measures of productivity is important because metrics like interest income and interest expense are endogenous functions of productivity. For example, all else equal, a bank that is better at raising deposits will rationally choose to become larger. In the presence of diminishing returns, this will drive the rate the bank pays on deposits closer to the rates paid by less deposit-productive banks. Thus, variation in observables is likely to understate the true variation in primitives across banks. We believe that our ability to estimate primitive productivity differences across banks represents an important step forward in our ability to identify differences in banks' business models.

We combine our asset and deposit productivity estimates with banks' market-to-book (M/B) ratios from 1994 to 2015 to identify the primary determinants of bank value. The benefit of looking at M/B is that it provides us with a natural economic benchmark: under the frictionless null hypothesis that banks create no value, all banks should have M/B equal to one. Hence, the use of M/B allows us to better understand the relative quantitative contributions of deposit taking and lending to bank value.

Our first main finding is that the liability side of the balance sheet drives the majority of cross-sectional variation in bank value. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in deposit productivity is associated with an increase in M/B of 0.2 to 0.8 points, consistent with there being significant heterogeneity in banks' abilities to capture value by manufacturing safe assets. In contrast, a one-standard deviation increase in asset productivity is associated with an increase in M/B of 0.1 to 0.2 points. Hence, variation in deposit productivity accounts for more than twice as much variation in bank value as variation in asset productivity.

With a few additional assumptions, we reach our second finding: the levels of bank net income and value are also primarily driven by the liability side. To go from the cross-section to the level of net income, we need a normalization that maps a single level of productivity to zero value. We assume that a bank earning an asset yield equal to the 5-year Treasury yield has an asset productivity contribution to value of zero. For deposit productivity, we assume that if a bank pays depositors a rate equal to 3-month LIBOR, deposit productivity's contribution to value is zero. Under these assumptions, we find that the share of net income attributable to deposits for the median bank in our sample is  $70\%$ . The heterogeneity across banks is substantial: deposits contribute more to net income for  $60\% - 70\%$  of banks, while lending is more important for the remaining  $30\% - 40\%$ . Although both sides of the balance sheet are important, our overall results suggest that the liability side is quantitatively more important than the asset side for most banks.

We shed further light on the economic sources of bank value creation by disaggregating these results, asking which products and business lines are most closely associated with bank valuations. We find that a bank's ability to collect savings deposits is the main driver of value, explaining over three times as much variation in M/B as any other factor. The strength of our results for savings deposits compared to transaction deposits suggests that safety provision plays a particularly important role in creating bank value compared to providing liquidity services. On the asset side, we find that banks with high asset productivity hold more real estate and offer more loan commitments, consistent with the idea that information production about borrowers is an important source of bank value.

Next, we examine the main drivers of our productivity measures. Our estimation approach closely follows the literature on total factor productivity in nonfinancial firms (see, e.g., Syverson 2011). Therefore, our measures by design capture more than just technological differences; they also capture the effects of managerial and employee skill, market power, and geographic and demographic factors. We group these various effects into two categories: (i) differences in banks' exposures to different types of customers, and (ii) differences in banks' production technologies, which capture variation in productivity holding customer exposures fixed.

We show that both categories of potential drivers are important for explaining our productivity measures and bank value. To explore variation in productivity driven by customer demographics and market power, we analyze the relationships between banks' geographical footprints and our productivity measures. We find that the demographic characteristics of the areas banks operate in are twice as important for explaining deposit productivity as asset productivity. Banks with less sophisticated clients that operate in areas with less competition tend to be more productive at both gathering deposits and investing. Our results suggest bank location matters and is correlated with a bank's ability to collect deposits and invest. However, even after flexibly controlling for banks' geographic footprints, we still find that both of our productivity measures are strongly related to bank value, with deposit productivity continuing to be more strongly related to value than asset productivity. This suggests that differences in market power and customer demographics alone do not fully explain variation in our productivity measures or the explanatory power of our measures for value. Technological differences in productivity also play an important role.

Finally, to examine technological differences across banks, we use additional data on the quality and pricing of bank services. Banks that are deposit-productive receive fewer customer complaints. These banks also appear to use more sophisticated, decentralized pricing strategies in setting deposit and mortgage rates. These findings help to validate our productivity measures and illustrate how firm structure, technology, and the quality of inputs drive productivity.

Our results are robust to a variety of potential concerns. We consider alternative constructions of productivity, measures of asset-side output beyond revenue, and other measures of shareholder value such as profitability and total market capitalization, and find that our main results do not change. We also show that our results are not driven by the largest banks, the financial crisis, or banks that do not primarily engage in traditional banking activities.

In summary, this paper empirically quantifies the primary determinants of bank value for traditional banks that primarily take deposits and make loans. We find that both the asset and liability sides play an important role, with deposits, and savings deposits in particular, accounting for the majority of value for the median bank. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in how banks create value. For  $30\% - 40\%$  of banks, assets account for the majority of value.

Our paper is related to several strands of the literature tackling what makes banks "special." This literature highlights frictions that break the Modigliani-Miller irrelevance result and allow banks to create value. While the theoretical literature is largely concerned with the total social value created by banks, we examine private value accruing to bank shareholders, which is the only component of total value that is empirically observable. As such, we believe our analysis is an important step forward in empirically understanding the total social value created by banks. One strand of the literature argues that banks produce "safe," liquid, and adverse-selection-free liabilities, such as bank deposits.<sup>3</sup> Our paper adds to this literature by quantifying the effects of liability creation on bank value. We find strong links between a bank's value and its ability to produce deposits. In addition, our results shed light on the characteristics of bank debt that create value. Our strongest results are for savings deposits, which, while safe, are not fully liquid.

A second strand of the literature argues that banks produce valuable information about borrowers through the screening and monitoring of loans.4 Consistent with this literature, we find evidence that a bank's skill in investing in information sensitive assets is linked to its value, though asset productivity

appears to be less important for value than for deposit productivity. A related literature focuses on estimating bank production functions.<sup>5</sup> These papers largely focus on total cost and profit efficiency, with the aim of assessing economies of scale in banking, rather than separately examining the asset and deposit production functions of a bank. As we will discuss further in Section 5.2, our deposit and asset productivity measures are conceptually distinct from existing estimates of bank cost and profit efficiency, such as Berger and Mester (1997), and measure different aspects of a bank's production function. Our productivity estimates follow standard methodologies from the industrial organization literature, and our paper joins the growing literature at the intersection of industrial organization and finance.<sup>6</sup>

A large literature investigates the synergies between bank assets and liabilities.7 Consistent with this literature, we find that a bank's asset productivity is correlated with its deposit productivity. Synergies make it challenging to separately assign value to a bank's deposit and lending businesses since being deposit productive might raise a bank's asset productivity and vice versa. We show that our treatment of synergies does not affect our overall conclusions about value creation. Even when we ascribe the part of deposit productivity correlated with asset productivity to asset productivity, deposit productivity is still responsible for the majority of bank value.

## 1. Economic Framework

In this section, we present a simple economic framework linking a bank's value with its productivity at raising deposits and its skill at investing its assets. Let  $A_{jt}$  be the total assets of bank  $j = 1,\dots,J$  at time  $t$ . Banks fund their assets by raising deposits  $D_{jt}$  and with equity  $E_{jt}$ . Per-period bank profits are then given by

$$
\pi_ {j t} = f \left(A _ {j t}; \phi_ {j t}\right) - c \left(D _ {j t}; \delta_ {j t}\right). \tag {1}
$$

Here  $f(\cdot ;\cdot)$  gives the bank's revenue as a function of its assets,  $c(\cdot ;\cdot)$  gives the bank's funding costs as a function of the quantity of deposits it raises, and  $A_{jt} = D_{jt} + E_{jt}$ .

The primitives are asset productivity  $\phi_{jt}$  and deposit productivity  $\delta_{jt}$ , which the bank takes as given. Asset productivity  $\phi_{jt}$  reflects bank  $j$ 's skill in making

loans and holding securities. Higher values of  $\phi_{jt}$  mean that the bank is better at lending – it generates more revenue from a fixed asset base. Deposit productivity  $\delta_{jt}$  captures differences in efficiency across banks in raising deposits. Higher values of  $\delta_{jt}$  mean that the bank is better at raising deposits – it can raise a fixed amount of deposits at a lower cost. In our empirical analysis below, we explore the drivers of differences in productivity primitives across banks. Conceptually these differences can arise for a variety of reasons, including differences in technologies for making loans or serving depositors, differences in human capital of loan officers or bank tellers, differences in management quality, differences in market power or customers served, and other factors.[8]

Bank  $j$  takes  $\phi_{jt}$  and  $\delta_{jt}$  as given and chooses its assets and deposits to maximize Equation (1). The first-order condition from this optimization implicitly defines the bank's equilibrium assets, deposits, and profits in terms of  $\phi_{jt}$  and  $\delta_{jt}$ . We assume that fraction  $\lambda$  of profits are paid out to shareholders and that profits grow at rate  $g$ . In addition, we assume the market for equity is competitive and profits are discounted at required rate of return  $k$ . The market value of bank  $j$ 's equity is then

$$
M _ {j t} (\phi_ {j t}, \delta_ {j t}) = \frac {\lambda \pi_ {j t} ^ {*} (\phi_ {j t} , \delta_ {j t})}{k - g},
$$

where  $\pi_{jt}^{*}(\phi_{jt},\delta_{jt})$  is the bank's equilibrium profits. The market-to-book (M/B) ratio is obtained by dividing by book equity  $E_{jt}$ . Equilibrium profits, market values, and M/B ratios are all determined by the primitives  $\phi_{jt}$  and  $\delta_{jt}$ .<sup>9</sup>

This simple framework demonstrates why we need to recover productivity primitives in order to decompose bank value between lending and deposit taking. The bank's equilibrium assets and deposits depend on both primitives. Similarly, the return on assets the bank earns and the cost of deposits the bank pays depend on both primitives. If a bank is good at gathering deposits, it will optimally scale up. If it faces diminishing returns, as the bank scales up, it will earn less on its assets and pay more on its deposits. Similarly, if a bank is good at lending, it will optimally scale up, and as it scales up, it will earn less on its assets and pay more on its deposits. Thus, the bank's equilibrium balance sheet, as well as its equilibrium interest income and interest expense, mix how good the bank is at raising deposits with how good it is at lending. To attribute bank value to deposit taking or lending, we must therefore first recover the primitives  $\phi_{jt}$  and  $\delta_{jt}$ .

## 1.1 Bank assets

We now describe how we use a standard, flexible framework from the industrial organization literature to recover the primitives  $\phi_{jt}$  and  $\delta_{jt}$  in the data. On the asset side, we model bank  $j$  as generating revenue of  $Y_{j,t} = f(A_{j,t};\phi_{j,t})$  from making loans and holding securities, where total assets  $A_{jt}$  equal the sum of the deposits and other capital.

We approximate the bank's asset production function as

$$
Y _ {j t} = \phi_ {j t} A _ {j t} ^ {\theta}. \tag {2}
$$

This functional form corresponds to a first-order Taylor series approximation of any production function (see, e.g., Syverson 2011). The parameter  $\theta$  reflects returns to scale in production, and  $\phi_{jt}$  is bank  $j$ 's asset productivity, reflecting the excess risk-adjusted revenue the bank can earn on its loans and securities. Variation in  $\phi_{jt}$  may arise from skill in underwriting loans or trading securities, selection of markets to operate in, and other factors.

Asset productivity directly translates into bank profits and value in our framework. As an illustration, suppose a bank's asset productivity increases from  $\phi_j^0$  to  $\phi_j^1$ . All else equal, this increase in asset productivity results in an increase in profits of  $(\phi_j^1 - \phi_j^0)A_{jt}^\theta$ . In other words, the partial derivative of profits with respect to asset productivity is simply  $\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial \phi_{jt}} = A_{jt}^\theta$ .

## 1.2 Bank deposits

On the deposit side, we model banks as producing deposit products that are valued by consumers. The value consumers place on deposits is a function of the deposit rate and quality of services provided. A consumer depositing funds at bank  $j$  at time  $t$  earns the net-of-fee deposit rate  $i_{jt}$ , which yields utility  $\alpha i_{jt}$ . The parameter  $\alpha > 0$  measures the consumer's sensitivity to deposit rates. Depositor  $k$  also derives utility from deposit services produced by banks, given by  $F_{jt}(X_{jt}) + \varepsilon_{jkt}$ . The function  $F_{jt}(X_{jt})$  is a bank-specific production function for turning costly inputs  $X_{jt}$ , such as capital, labor, and noninterest expenditures, into services valued by consumers like At Ms and checking services. We parameterize the production function as  $F_{jt}(X_{jt}) = \beta X_{jt} + \delta_{jt}$ . The parameter  $\beta$  reflects a technology that is common across banks for turning costly inputs into services valued by consumers. We assume that these noninterest inputs  $X_{jt}$  are fixed on a short-term (quarter-to-quarter) basis, while deposit rates are flexibly adjusted. The bank-specific effect,  $\delta_{jt}$ , denotes the bank's productivity at raising deposits. Conditional on the other inputs, banks with higher deposit productivity offer superior services and hence higher utility to consumers. Thus, deposit productivity captures differences in efficiency across banks in producing deposits from costly inputs  $X_{jt}$ . Variation in productivity could be driven by differences in production technologies (i.e., physical productivity), brand/franchise value, selection of markets to operate in, and other factors. Finally, the term  $\varepsilon_{jkt}$  is a consumer-bank-specific utility shock capturing

preference heterogeneity across consumers: some consumers may inherently prefer Bank of America to Citibank (or vice versa). Thus, the total indirect utility derived by a depositor  $k$  from bank  $j$  at time  $t$  is

$$
u _ {j k t} = \alpha i _ {j t} + \beta X _ {j t} + \delta_ {j t} + \varepsilon_ {j k t}. \tag {3}
$$

Our analysis focuses on deposit productivity,  $\delta_{jt}$ . Conditional on the offered net-of-fee deposit rate  $i_{jt}$  and other bank characteristics  $(X_{jt})$ , more productive banks attract more depositors. From the bank's perspective, a more productive bank faces a demand curve for deposits that is shifted up.

Each consumer selects the bank from the set of banks indexed  $j = 1, \dots, J$  that maximizes their utility. We also assume that consumers have access to an outside good, which represents placing funds outside the traditional banking sector. Without loss of generality, we normalize the utility of the outside good to zero ( $u_0 = 0$ ). We follow the standard assumption in the industrial organization literature (Berry 1994; Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes 1995) and assume that the utility shock  $\varepsilon_{jkt}$  is independently and identically distributed across banks and consumers and follows a Type 1 Extreme Value distribution. Given this distributional assumption, the probability that a consumer selects bank  $j$  follows a multinomial logit distribution. The market share for bank  $j$ , denoted  $s_{jt}$ , is then

$$
s _ {j t} \left(i _ {j t}, \mathbf {i} _ {- \mathbf {j} t}; \boldsymbol {\delta} _ {t}\right) = \frac {\exp \left(\alpha i _ {j t} + \beta X _ {j t} + \delta_ {j t}\right)}{\sum_ {l = 1} ^ {J} \exp \left(\alpha i _ {l t} + \beta X _ {l t} + \delta_ {l t}\right) + 1}. \tag {4}
$$

The total market size for deposits at time  $t$  is denoted  $N_{t}$ , so bank  $j$  raises  $s_{jt}N_{t}$  deposits.

Deposit productivity has a direct effect on the cost of raising deposits. Let  $c(D_{jt}; \mathbf{i}_{-jt}; \delta_t)$  denote the interest cost of collecting  $D_{jt}$  deposits. One can show that a one-unit increase in deposit productivity decreases the cost of collecting  $D_{jt}$  deposits by  $\frac{1}{\alpha} D_{jt}$ , that is,  $\frac{\partial c(D_{jt}; \mathbf{i}_{-jt}; \delta_t)}{\partial \delta_{jt}} = -\frac{1}{\alpha} D_{jt}$ . Thus, a one-unit increase in deposit productivity leads to a  $\frac{1}{\alpha} D_{jt}$  increase in profits.

## 1.3 Summary

Putting together the asset side and deposit side, the specific version of the profit function equation (1) we work with empirically is

$$
\pi_ {j t} = \phi_ {j t} A _ {j t} ^ {\theta} - i _ {j t} \times \underbrace {N s _ {j t} \left(i _ {j t} ; \mathbf {i} _ {- \mathbf {j t}} ; \boldsymbol {\delta} _ {\boldsymbol {j}}\right)} _ {D _ {j t}} - X _ {j t}.
$$

Note that bank profits are linear in both deposit and asset productivity,  $\frac{\partial\pi_{jt}}{\partial\phi_{jt}} = A_{jt}^{\theta} > 0$  and  $\frac{\partial\pi_{jt}}{\partial\delta_{jt}} = \frac{1}{\alpha} D_{jt} > 0$ . In the empirics, we use these specifications to recover each bank's deposit and asset productivity in the data and then examine how variation in bank deposit and asset productivity contribute to bank value.

## 2. Data and Estimation

## 2.1 Data

Our primary data source is the Federal Reserve FR Y-9C reports, which provide quarterly balance sheet and income statement data for all U.S. bank holding companies. We supplement the Y-9C data with stock market data from CRSP and weekly branch-level data on advertised deposit rates from RateWatch. We also obtain branch-level deposit quantities from the annual FDIC Summary of Deposits files and data on consumer complaints from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Finally, we obtain countyand metropolitan statistical area (MSA)-level demographic characteristics from the U.S. Census Bureau, and mortgage originations from Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data.

Our sample is the universe of publicly listed U.S. bank holding companies. Our primary data set consists of an unbalanced panel of 847 bank holding companies over the period 1994 through 2015. Observations are at the bank holding company by quarter level. Table 1 provides the summary statistics for our main data set. Our three primary measures of bank risk are equity beta, the standard deviation of return on assets, and the standard deviation of the return (net of losses) on loan and securities. Following Baker and Wurgler (2015), we calculate the equity beta for each bank using monthly returns over the past 2 years. Similarly, we measure the standard deviation of return on assets and net return on loans and securities using quarterly data over the past 2 years. Internet Appendix E defines the variables.

## 2.2 Estimation: Bank deposits

We estimate the demand system described in Section 1.2 using our bank data set over the period 1994 through 2015. Using equation (4), we write a bank's log market share  $s_{jt}$  as

$$
\ln s _ {j t} = \alpha i _ {j t} + \beta X _ {j t} + \delta_ {j t} - \ln \left(\sum_ {l = 1} ^ {J} \exp \left(\alpha i _ {l t} + \beta X _ {l t} + \delta_ {l t}\right) + 1\right). \tag {5}
$$

Note that the nonlinear term  $\ln \left(\sum_{l=1}^{J} \exp(\alpha i_{lt} + \beta X_{lt} + \delta_{lt}) + 1\right)$  is constant across banks  $j$  in a given time period  $t$ . Consequently, if we include a time

fixed effect, Equation (5) is linear in the parameters of interest and can be estimated using ordinary least squares. In our empirical analysis estimate the empirically equivalent specification:

$$
\ln s _ {j t} = \alpha i _ {j t} + \beta X _ {j t} + \underbrace {\mu_ {j} + \xi_ {j t}} _ {\delta_ {j t}}. + \underbrace {\mu_ {t}} _ {- \ln \left(\sum_ {l = 1} ^ {J} \exp \left(\alpha i _ {l t} + \beta X _ {l t} + \delta_ {l t}\right) + 1\right)} \tag {6}
$$

where  $\mu_t$  is a time fixed effect;  $\mu_j$  is a bank fixed effect;  $X_{jt}$  and  $i_{jt}$  are bank characteristics; and  $\xi_{jt}$  is an unobserved bank-time-specific residual. In our baseline specification, we define market shares at the aggregate U.S. by quarter level such that each quarter in the U.S. constitutes a market and observations in Equation (6) are at the bank by quarter level. As robustness checks, we estimate alternative demand systems where we define market shares at the county by

year level and where we define market shares based on the type of deposit (e.g., checking deposits, savings) in Sections 3.4.1 and 5.

Our objective is to estimate each bank's deposit productivity, which measures a bank's ability to collect deposits conditional on its inputs. Consequently, it is important that we control for a bank's inputs into the deposit collection process, such as the deposit interest expense and number of bank branches. We measure deposit interest expense  $i_{jt}$  as total interest expense on deposits, net of fees on deposit accounts, divided by total deposits. We account for all other expenses reported in the Y-9C reports in  $X_{jt}$ , which include banks' noninterest expenditures, number of employees, and number of branches. Noninterest expenditures should capture investments made by the bank in providing higher-quality services to consumers, such as better At Ms or longer branch hours. In addition, the number of branches and number of employees may also factor into a consumer's selection of a depository institution. The coefficient  $\beta$  on  $X_{jt}$  captures how well banks are able to transform these inputs into utility/services valued by consumers.[11]

We also include bank fixed effects to capture persistent differences in a bank's ability to collect deposits. All else equal, a bank with a higher fixed effect collects more deposits for a fixed set of deposit-related expenses and inputs  $(i_{jt}, X_{jt})$ . This is conceptually similar to the distribution free approach suggested in Berger (1993). The term  $\xi_{jt}$  reflects within bank variation in its ability to collect deposits over time. Deposit productivity of bank  $j$  at time  $t$  is then the sum of the bank's fixed effect  $\mu_j$  and its residual  $\xi_{jt}$ .

A standard issue in demand estimation is the endogeneity of prices, which in our case are deposit rates. $^{12}$  The term  $\xi_{jt}$  in Equation (6) represents an unobserved bank-time-specific shock. If banks observe  $\xi_{jt}$  prior to setting deposit rates, the offered deposit rate will be correlated with the unobservable term  $\xi_{jt}$ . For example, suppose bank  $j$  experiences a demand shock so that  $\xi_{jt}$  is positive. It will then optimally offer a lower deposit rate. This will cause our estimate of  $\alpha$  to be biased downward.

We use two sets of instruments to account for the endogeneity of deposit rates. First, following Villas-Boas (2007) and Egan, Hortaçsu, and Matvos (2017), we construct instruments from the bank-specific pass-through of 3-month LIBOR into deposit rates. As documented by Hannan and Berger (1991), Neumark and Sharpe (1992), Driscoll and Judson (2013), Gomez et al. (2021), and Drechsler, Savov, and Schnabl (2017), deposit rates at different banks respond differently to changes in short-term interest rates. As Drechsler, Savov, and Schnabl (2017) show, variation in pass-through is driven by market power,

a supply-side characteristic, not by consumer demand. Thus, we can instrument for  $i_{jt}$ , the deposit rate offered by bank  $j$  at time  $t$ , with the fitted value of a bank-specific regression of  $i_{jt}$  on 3-month LIBOR. The exclusion restriction here is that bank  $j$ 's average degree of pass-through in the time series interacted with 3-month LIBOR is orthogonal to the deposit demand it faces at time  $t$ .

Our second set of instruments are traditional Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995)-type instruments: the average product characteristics of a bank's competitors. We use lags of slow-moving competitor product characteristics. Specifically, we use the number of bank branches, number of employees, noninterest expenditures, and banking fees of a bank's competitors, but we do not use the deposit rates they offer. We calculate the average product characteristics offered by each bank's competitor at the county by quarter level. We then form our instrument by taking the average of a bank's competitors' product characteristics across all counties the bank operates in.[13] Intuitively, a bank must offer higher deposit rates if its competitors offer better products. The exclusion restriction in this setting is that lagged average competitor product characteristics are orthogonal to current bank-quarter-specific demand shocks. Internet Appendix A provides more details on the instruments.

Table 2 displays the corresponding demand estimates using aggregate bank-quarter data from the Y-9C reports. Column 1 of Table 2 displays the simple ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates corresponding to Equation (6), while column 2 uses both sets of instruments (which yields a first-stage F-statistic in excess of 100). We estimate a positive and significant relationship between demand for deposits and the net-of-fee deposit rate. Moreover, as we would expect, the IV estimates tend to be higher than the OLS estimates. For a bank with an initial market share of  $10\%$ , the coefficient 17.85 in column 2 implies that a one-percentage-point increase in the offered deposit rate is associated with a 1.6-percentage-point increase in market share. These demand elasticities are in line with the existing literature (Dick 2008; Egan, Hortaçsu, and Matvos 2017; Xiao 2020). In Section 5, we show robustness to a variety of alternative demand specifications.

We use our estimated demand system to calculate each bank's deposit productivity at each point in time. Specifically, we measure bank  $j$ 's deposit productivity at time  $t$  as

$$
\hat {\delta} _ {j t} = \ln s _ {j t} - \hat {\alpha} i _ {j t} - \hat {\beta} X _ {j t} - \hat {\mu} _ {t} = \hat {\mu} _ {j} + \hat {\xi} _ {j t}. \tag {7}
$$

The table displays the results corresponding to our demand estimates (Equation (6)). The unit of observation is at the bank by quarter level. The key independent variable of interest is the deposit rate offered for each bank. We measure the deposit rate as the bank's total quarterly net of fee deposit interest expense (scaled by 4) divided by the bank's level of deposits. Because of the potential endogeneity of the deposit rate, we instrument for the deposit rate using two sets of instruments. We construct our first instrument set (IV-1) as the estimated deposit rate from a bank-specific pass-through regression of deposit rates on 3-month LIBOR. We construct our second instrument set (IV-2) as the average of the product characteristics offered by a bank's competitors in the previous quarter (branches, employees, noninterest expense, and fees) as described in the text. We winsorize all independent variables at the  $1\%$  level to help control for outliers in the sample. Standard errors are clustered by bank and are reported in parentheses.  $^* p < .1$ ;  $^{**}p < .05$ ;  $^{***}p < .01$ .

Our estimates of deposit productivity have an intuitive reduced-form interpretation. More productive banks are raising more deposits with the same inputs than less productive banks. Bank deposit productivity is highly persistent in the data, with a quarterly autocorrelation of 0.99.

## 2.3 Estimation: Bank assets

Next, we estimate the asset production function to recover each bank's asset productivity at a given point in time. We focus on assets associated with traditional banking, namely, loans and securities held outside the trading book, because these are the main assets held by the banks in our sample.

We can write the bank's log production function as

$$
\ln Y _ {j t} = \theta \ln A _ {j t} + \phi_ {j t}.
$$

We treat the asset and liability sides of the bank differently because in contrast to the liability side, where banks have one main product (deposits), on the asset side banks produce many different products (e.g., mortgages, commercial loans, securities, and other trading assets). We measure asset-side output using income because it aggregates across all products. Given that securities holdings and other investments compose a large portion of a bank's balance sheet, we believe income is a natural measure of output for the asset side of the balance sheet.

We parameterize and estimate the production function as

$$
\ln Y _ {j t} = \theta \ln A _ {j t} + \Gamma X _ {j t} + \gamma_ {j} + \gamma_ {t} + \epsilon_ {j t}. \tag {8}
$$

The dependent variable  $Y_{jt}$  measures interest income net of realized losses on loans and securities generated by bank  $j$  at time  $t$ .<sup>14</sup> We measure a bank's assets  $A_{jt}$  as the average of the bank's interest-bearing assets over the previous four quarters to capture the potential lag between the time an investment decision is made and initial returns are realized.<sup>15</sup> We include additional control variables  $X_{jt}$ : the bank's equity beta, leverage, the standard deviation of its return on assets, and the standard deviation of the net return on interest-bearing assets  $(Y_{jt} / A_{jt})$ , to capture the riskiness of bank assets. As in our deposit demand estimation, we also control for the other production inputs in  $X_{jt}$ , including banks' noninterest expenditures, number of employees, and number of branches. The regression includes time fixed effects,  $\gamma_t$ , to absorb the common variation in banks' asset productivity over time.

We include bank fixed effects  $\gamma_{j}$  to capture persistent differences in a bank's ability to generate risk-adjusted returns. All else equal, a bank with a higher fixed effect generates more income for a given level of assets and risk. The term  $\epsilon_{jt}$  reflects variation in bank  $j$ 's ability to generate risk-adjusted income over time. Collectively, the bank fixed effect and residual term are equal to bank asset productivity, such that  $\phi_{jt} = \gamma_{j} + \epsilon_{jt}$ .

A challenge in estimating Equation (8) is the potential endogeneity of bank size  $(\ln A_{jt})$ . If a bank observes its productivity  $\phi_{jt}$  prior to determining its investments, then size is endogenous in Equation (8). This is a well-known problem dating back to Marschak and Andrews (1944), which much of the industrial organization literature on production has been devoted to addressing.[16]

Conceptually, we need an instrument that is correlated with bank size but is otherwise uncorrelated with the bank's asset productivity. We construct cost-shifter instruments in the style of Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995). Specifically, we instrument for bank interest-bearing assets  $(\ln A_{jt})$  using the average deposit productivity of bank  $j$ 's competitors.[17] In addition, we also

$$
\overline {{\delta_ {- j}}} = \overline {{\sum_ {k \in K} \frac {N _ {k}}{N} \sum_ {l \in L - j k} \hat {\delta} _ {l}}}.
$$

include the fixed deposit characteristics of a bank's competitors (i.e., our BLP instruments from Section 2.2) in our instrument set. The idea is that if a bank faces competitors that are better at raising deposits, it will naturally be smaller, so competitor deposit productivity induces variation in bank size that is orthogonal to the bank's own asset productivity.

Table 3 displays the corresponding estimates. In columns 1-3, we report OLS estimates, and in columns 4-6, we report the IV estimates. Our instruments are empirically relevant and yield first-stage F-statistics in excess of 75 for each specification. In each specification, we also estimate a coefficient for  $\ln A_{jt}(\theta)$  that is less than one, implying that banks face decreasing returns to scale.[18]

We use the estimated production function to compute bank  $j$ 's asset productivity at time  $t$  as

$$
\hat {\phi} _ {j t} = \ln Y _ {j t} - \hat {\theta} \ln A _ {j t} - \hat {\Gamma} X _ {j t} - \hat {\gamma} _ {t} = \hat {\gamma} _ {j} + \hat {\epsilon} _ {j t}.
$$

Our asset productivity is equal to the estimated bank fixed effect plus the bank-quarter-specific residual. Note that this construction implies that our asset productivity measures will include any differences in economies of scale  $(\theta)$  across banks. In our main results, we calculate banks' asset productivity using this equation based on the estimates in column 5 of Table 3. The reduced-form interpretation of our results is simply that more asset-productive banks generate more income than less productive banks with the same inputs. Asset productivity is highly persistent in the data, with a quarterly autocorrelation of 0.95.

## 3. Economic Sources of Bank Value

## 3.1 Productivity and the cross-section of bank value

We begin by examining how our productivity measures relate to a stock-market based measure of value: the market-to-book (M/B) ratio. It is worth noting up front that because we are using a market-based measure of value, our results only directly speak to private value created for shareholders, not the total social value created by banks.

We regress M/B on our estimates of deposit and asset productivity as well as time fixed effects and additional bank-level controls:

$$
\left(\frac {M}{B}\right) _ {j t} = \gamma_ {0} + \gamma_ {1} \hat {\delta} _ {j t} + \gamma_ {2} \hat {\phi} _ {j t} + \Gamma X _ {j t} + \mu_ {t} + \varepsilon_ {j t}. \tag {9}
$$

We use M/B as a proxy for average  $Q$ , the average market value created per dollar of book assets, not marginal  $Q$ , as it is sometimes used in the

The table displays the results corresponding to our asset income production function estimates (Equation (8)). The unit of observation is at the bank by quarter level. The dependent variable is the log interest income, net of losses. The key independent variable of interest is log interest-bearing assets. Interest income and interest-bearing assets exclude interest income and assets from trading. We measure interest-bearing assets based on the quarterly average over the previous four quarters. Because of the potential endogeneity of interest-bearing assets, we instrument for assets in columns 4-6. Specifically, we instrument for assets using the weighted average of the deposit product characteristics of a bank's competitors as described in Section 3.3. We also control for the bank's equity beta, the standard deviation of return on assets (standardized), the standard deviation of net return on interest-bearing assets (standardized), and leverage. We measure beta on a rolling basis using monthly equity returns over the previous 24 months with data from CRSP and Kenneth French. We measure the standard deviation of return on assets and net return on interest-bearing assets on a rolling basis using quarterly income statement/balance sheet data over the previous eight quarters. Standard errors are clustered at the bank level and are reported in parentheses.  $^* p < .1$ ;  $^{**}p < .05$ ;  $^{***}p < .01$ .

investment literature. M/B is a particularly useful measure because it provides a natural economic benchmark: under the null hypothesis that the Modigliani-Miller theorem holds, banks create no social or private value. Thus, all banks should have an M/B of one. In Section 5, we also verify that our results hold using alternative measures of bank value, such as profitability and total market capitalization.

Table 4 displays the results. All specifications include time fixed effects, so our analysis is solely based on cross-sectional variation. We standardize our productivity measures so that the coefficients correspond to a one-standard-deviation increase in productivity. Standard errors are clustered by bank and are computed by bootstrap to account for the fact that our productivity measures are estimated.

The table displays the estimation results corresponding to a linear regression model (Equation (9)). Observations are at the bank by quarter level. The dependent variable is the bank's market-to-book ratio. The key independent variables of interest are deposit and asset productivity. Both deposit and asset productivity are standardized. The deposit productivity estimates correspond to the specification reported in column 2 of Table 2. The asset productivity estimates correspond to the specification reported in column 5 of Table 3. Other controls include log assets (lagged by 1 year); leverage (lagged by one quarter); 3-month returns (lagged by one quarter); equity beta; the standard deviation of the (net of losses) return on interest-bearing assets; the standard deviation of return on assets; the share of deposit liabilities; and the share of assets in loans and securities. Standard errors are reported in parentheses and are cluster bootstrapped at the bank level  $(\mathrm{n} = 1,000)$  to account for the two-stage estimation procedure.  $^{*}p < .1$ $^{**}p < .05$ $^{***}p < .01$

Column 1 documents the baseline relationship between deposit productivity and M/B. In column 2, we add controls  $X_{jt}$  to account for size and risk: lagged (log) assets; leverage; the bank's estimated equity beta; the standard deviation of its net return on interest-bearing assets; the standard deviation of its return on assets (ROA); the share of deposit liabilities; the share of loans in assets; and the share of securities in assets.[19]

The results show that a one-standard-deviation increase in deposit productivity is associated with an increase in M/B of 0.2 to 0.8 points, an economically significant effect. The cross-sectional standard deviation of M/B is 0.69 in our sample.[20] Columns 3 and 4 show that a one-standard-deviation increase in asset productivity is associated with an increase in M/B of 0.1 to 0.2 points, an effect that is also economically significant.

Next, we compare the relative importance of deposit and asset productivity in determining bank value by simultaneously including both deposit and asset productivity in Equation (9). Columns 5 and 6 of Table 4 display the corresponding estimates. Bank value loads positively on both asset and deposit productivity in both specifications. However, deposit productivity has a larger impact on M/B than asset productivity. The results in column 5 indicate that

a one-standard-deviation increase deposit productivity is associated with an increase of 0.2 points in M/B, whereas a one-standard-deviation increase in asset productivity is associated with an increase of 0.08 points in M/B. Relative to asset productivity, the impact of deposit productivity is about twice as large in column 5, where we only include time fixed effects, and roughly seven times as large in column 6, where we include the full suite of controls. This suggests that liability-driven theories of bank value creation, which focus on the special services provided by bank deposits, explain more variation in the cross-section of banks than do asset-driven theories.

## 3.2 Relationship between deposit and asset productivity

An important consideration in our above analysis is that there may be synergies between deposit gathering and lending. Synergies make it challenging to separately assign value to a bank's deposit and lending businesses. A bank may have a high value of our asset productivity measure, that is, earn high revenues given its asset base, because in reality it is deposit productive (e.g., its deposit business allows it to write highly profitable credit lines). Conversely, a bank may have a high value of deposit productivity, that is, raise many deposits at relatively low cost, because in reality it is asset productive (e.g., has a good mortgage origination business that allows it to gather low-cost deposits by requiring that borrowers establish a deposit account).

To assess this possibility, we examine the relationship between our productivity measures in Table 5, panel A. Specifically, we run regressions of the following form

$$
\hat {\phi} _ {j t} = \gamma_ {0} + \gamma_ {1} \hat {\delta} _ {j t} + \Gamma X _ {j t} + \mu_ {t} + \varepsilon_ {j t}. \tag {10}
$$

The table shows that our two productivity measures are correlated. Column 1 shows that a one-standard-deviation increase in deposit productivity is associated with a 0.45-standard-deviation increase in asset productivity. This is economically significant:  $20\%$  of the variation in our asset productivity measure can be explained by variation in deposit productivity. This correlation is consistent with the idea of synergies. However, it can be thought of as an upper bound on the strength of synergies, as it may be explained by factors like good management, in addition to the banking-specific synergies the theoretical literature focuses on.[21]

To understand the implications of the correlation between deposit productivity and asset productivity for our results in Table 4, we conduct a simple bounding exercise. We first residualize deposit productivity with respect

Panel A displays the relationship between deposit productivity and asset productivity (Equation (10)). Observations are at the bank by quarter level. All independent and dependent variables are standardized. The dependent variable is asset productivity as measured using the production function estimates reported in column 5 of Table 3. We measure deposit productivity using the demand estimates reported in column 2 of Table 2. Panel B displays the relationship between banks' market-to-book ratio and their productivity (Equation (11)). The dependent variable is the bank's market-to-book ratio. The independent variables deposit productivity, asset productivity, residualized deposit productivity, and residualized asset productivity are standardized. Residualized deposit productivity is constructed from the residual of the regression of deposit productivity on asset productivity, such that the variable residualized deposit productivity is the variation in deposit productivity that is orthogonal to variation in asset productivity. Residualized asset productivity is constructed from the residual of the regression of asset productivity on deposit productivity, such that the variable residualized asset productivity is the variation in asset productivity that is orthogonal to variation in deposit productivity. Other controls in both panels include log assets (lagged by 1 year); leverage (lagged by one quarter); 3-month returns (lagged by one quarter); equity beta; the standard deviation of the (net of losses) return on interest-bearing assets; the standard deviation of return on assets; the share of deposit liabilities; and the share of assets in loans and securities. The standard errors in both panels are reported in parentheses and are cluster bootstrapped at the bank level  $(n = 1,000)$  to account for the two-stage estimation procedure.  $^* p < .1$ ;  $^{**}p < .05$ ;  $^{***}p < .01$ .

to asset productivity and then run our benchmark regressions of market-to-book ratios on residualized deposit productivity and asset productivity:

$$
\left(\frac {M}{B}\right) _ {j t} = \gamma_ {0} + \gamma_ {1} \hat {\delta} _ {j t} ^ {*} + \gamma_ {2} \hat {\phi} _ {j t} + \Gamma X _ {j t} + \mu_ {t} + \varepsilon_ {j t}, \tag {11}
$$

where  $\hat{\delta}_{jt}^*$  is the residualized variation in deposit productivity for bank  $j$  and at time  $t$  and is constructed as the residual from a regression of deposit productivity on asset productivity. This exercise essentially ascribes to asset productivity any part of deposit productivity that could be due to synergies to the asset side of the balance sheet. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 5, panel B, report the corresponding results. The results confirm our baseline findings: even being as generous to the asset side of the balance sheet as possible, the majority of the variation in bank

value appears to come from the deposit side (columns 1 and 2). The results in column 2 indicate that a one-standard-deviation increase in residualized deposit productivity is correlated with a 0.64 increase in the market-to-book ratio, while a one-standard deviation-increase in asset productivity is correlated with a 0.41 increase in the market-to-book ratio.

In contrast, if we are as generous to the liability side of the balance sheet as possible, we attribute  $90\%$  of the variation in bank value to the deposit side. Columns 3 and 4 of Table 5, panel B, report the results of regressing the market-to-book ratio on deposit productivity and residualized asset productivity, which is the residual from a regression of asset productivity on deposit productivity. The results in column 4 indicate that a one-standard-deviation increase in deposit productivity is correlated with a 0.77 increase in the market-to-book ratio, while a one-standard-deviation increase in residualized asset productivity is associated with a 0.086 increase in the market-to-book ratio.

It is worth noting that if synergies played a central role in bank value creation, we would not be able to assign value to one side of the balance sheet or the other. For instance, consider the synergies between deposits and credit lines emphasized by Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002). Having more deposits raises the value to a bank of writing credit lines by reducing the incremental liquidity needed to meet draws on those credit lines. Conversely, having more credit lines increases the value of raising deposits because deposits allow the bank to reduce the amount of liquidity it holds to meet draws on credit lines. In this case, the incremental value generated by the union of deposits and credit lines does not "belong" to either the asset or liability side of the balance sheet. If these kinds of synergies constituted the majority of bank value, then our bounding exercise above would result in vastly different results when we attribute all synergies to the asset side of the balance sheet than when attribute all synergies to the liability side. The results of our bounding exercise suggest instead that synergies do create value but that they are not so large as to render our balance sheet decomposition uninformative.

## 3.3 From the cross-section to levels

Thus far, our results speak to the cross-section of bank value. With additional assumptions, we can also make statements about levels of net income and M/B. These exercises, which we will describe below, imply that for the average bank, deposit productivity makes a larger contribution to value than asset productivity.

3.3.1 Contributions to net income. In our framework in Section 1, if a bank's deposit productivity increases from  $\delta^0$  to  $\delta^1$ , the bank can offer a lower deposit rate and still collect the same amount of deposits. The cost savings of increasing deposit productivity, all else equal, are given by

$$
C o s t S a v i n g s = D e p o s i t s \times \frac {\delta^ {1} - \delta^ {0}}{\alpha}, \tag {12}
$$

where  $\alpha$  is the elasticity of demand for deposits. Given an assumed value for  $\delta^0$ , Equation (12) can be used to calculate deposit productivity's contribution to bank cash flows for each bank in our sample. Similarly, if a bank's asset productivity increases from  $\phi^0$  to  $\phi^1$ , all else equal its income increases by

$$
\Delta Y = \left[ e x p \left(\phi^ {1}\right) - e x p \left(\phi^ {0}\right) \right] e x p \left(\Gamma X _ {j}\right) A _ {j} ^ {\theta}. \tag {13}
$$

Given an assumed value for  $\phi^0$ , Equation (13) can be used to calculate asset productivity's contribution to bank cash flows for each bank in our sample. We pin down  $\phi^0$  by assuming that for a bank earning an asset yield equal to the 5-year Treasury yield, asset productivity's contribution to value is zero. Similarly, we pin down  $\delta^0$  assuming that if a bank pays depositors a rate equal to 3-month LIBOR, deposit productivity's contribution to value is zero.[22]

Figure 1 shows the decomposition of these contributions to net income across banks. The red shaded histogram shows deposit productivity's contribution to net income changes as we vary bank deposit productivity  $(\delta_{jt})$  across its observed distribution in the data. The blue histogram shows the analogous exercise varying asset productivity across its distribution in the data. The figure shows that deposit productivity contributes more to net income, as the average of the deposit productivity distribution is to the right of the average of the asset productivity distribution.

Figure 2 ignores the structure imposed by our framework and simply plots variation in interest income and interest expense, each normalized by assets. In this accounting-based decomposition of bank value, the contributions of the asset-side (interest income) and liability-side (interest expense) measures look comparable. The stark differences between Figures 1 and 2 therefore highlight the value of a more rigorous economic analysis. In particular, the accounting-based decomposition obscures the primitives that enter the bank's optimization problem and are responsible for determining a bank's value. For example, if banks that are good at raising deposits and investing optimally increase their scale and there are diminishing returns, then variation in observed (scaled) interest income and interest expense will be smaller than the underlying variation in productivity. This is exactly what we find in Figures 1 and 2.

3.3.2 Contributions to value. Next, we calculate the model-implied M/B ratio for each bank. In contrast to our reduced-form estimates in Table 4, which flexibly allow the payout ratio  $\lambda$ , discount rate  $k$ , and growth rate  $g$  to vary across banks, in this exercise, we assume that they are the same for all banks. With

Figure 1 Value creation: Asset productivity versus deposit productivity

This figure displays the estimated distributions of asset and deposit productivity. Observations are at the bank by quarter level. The lighter-shaded histogram plots the distribution of bank deposit productivity scaled by  $\widetilde{Deposits} / A\frac{1}{\alpha}$ , where  $\widetilde{Deposits} / A$  denotes the median value for the banks in our sample. The darker-shaded histogram displays the scaled distribution of asset productivity, that is,  $\frac{\widetilde{Assets}^{\theta}}{\widetilde{Assets}}\exp (\phi_{jt} + \Gamma \tilde{X}_{jt})$ , where  $\widetilde{Assets}$  and  $\tilde{X}_{jt}$  denote the median values for the banks in our sample. As discussed in Section 3, the scaling converts deposit and asset productivity in terms of returns on assets. We normalize the level of asset productivity relative to 5-year Constant Maturity Treasury rates such that the set of banks earning risk-adjusted returns below the 5-year Treasury rate has negative asset productivity. We also normalize the deposit productivity distribution relative to 3-month LIBOR. Specifically, we calculate a bank's expected deposit rate as a function of its deposit productivity by regressing a bank's deposit rate on its deposit productivity and time fixed effects. We assume those banks whose expected deposit rate, conditional on deposit productivity, is equal to 3-month LIBOR do not generate any value from their level of deposit productivity. For banks paying less than 3-month LIBOR, deposit productivity contributes positively to value. Our normalization of the deposit productivity distribution means that the bottom  $16\%$  of banks in terms of deposit productivity quarter do not generate any value on the deposit side of the bank. The deposit productivity estimates correspond to the specification reported in column 2 of Table 2. The asset productivity estimates correspond to the specification reported in column 5 of Table 3.

these assumptions, we can write a bank's market-to-book ratio as a function of its deposit and asset productivity:

$$
M / B = \frac {\lambda}{k - g} \bigg [ e x p (\phi_ {j}) e x p (\Gamma X _ {j}) A _ {j} ^ {\theta} + D e p o s i t s \times \frac {\delta_ {j}}{\alpha} \bigg ] / A + 1.
$$

As described in Internet Appendix B, to calculate the model-implied market-to-book ratio, we estimate  $\frac{\lambda}{k - g}$  in the data to be 3.46, which is consistent with the historical average payout ratio of  $\lambda = 28\%$ , an average cost of equity of  $k = 9 - 10\%$ , and an average growth rate of  $g = 1 - 2\%$ .

Figure 3 plots model-implied estimates of M/B for each bank against observed M/Bs. The estimates from our simple quantitative framework seem to match the observed M/B data quite well. We can also determine the share of value coming from deposits for each bank. Figure 4 shows the distribution of deposit's share of value across banks. On average, deposit productivity accounts

Figure 2 Interest expense versus interest income

This figure displays the distributions of deposit interest expense and interest income. Observations are at the bank by quarter level. The lighter-shaded histogram plots the distribution of deposit interest expense divided by assets. The darker-shaded histogram plots the distribution of interest income divided by assets. Both deposit interest expense and interest income are annualized (multiplied by four).

for about twice as much value as asset productivity. The mean deposit share of bank value is  $64\%$ . However, there is significant heterogeneity across banks; for example, the majority of value comes from asset productivity for some banks.

Overall, our results show that deposit productivity is more important than asset productivity for explaining both the level of bank value and variation in value across banks.

## 3.4 Which assets and liabilities create value?

In this section, we disaggregate our results, asking which products and business lines are most related to bank valuations. This analysis sheds further light on the economic sources of bank value creation since certain products are most closely associated a particular theory of value creation. For instance, checking deposits are most closely associated with transaction services.

3.4.1 Decomposing bank productivity. We start in Table 6 by asking whether certain types of assets and deposits contribute particularly strongly to our overall productivity measures. Specifically, we compute productivity measures for different subcategories of assets and deposits the same way we construct our overall productivity measures as described in Section 2 and reported in Internet Appendix F. These more granular measures tell us whether, for instance, a bank is particularly good at raising savings deposits given the rate it pays on savings deposits and other inputs.

Table 6 shows that the ability to raise savings deposits is particularly important for bank value, suggesting that safety provision, moreso than

This figure displays a binned scatter plot of each bank's market value versus the model-implied estimate. Observations are at the bank by quarter level. The binned scatter plot includes time fixed effects. We calculate the model-implied market-to-book ratio as the predicted value from the regression  $M / B_{jt} = \beta_0 + \frac{\lambda}{k - g}\widehat{\omega}_{jt} + \mu_t + \epsilon_{jt}$ . The term  $\widehat{\omega}_{jt}$  measures bank excess per-period returns as a function of its deposit and asset productivity. We estimate  $\widehat{\frac{\lambda}{k - g}} = 3.46$ . We calculate  $\widehat{\omega}_{jt} = \left[exp(\hat{\phi}_{jt})exp(\Gamma \tilde{X}_j)\tilde{A}_j^{\theta -1} + \widehat{Deposits} /A\frac{\hat{\delta}_{jt}}{\alpha}\right]$ , where  $(\sim)$  denotes the median value for the banks in our sample. As discussed in Section 3, this scaling converts deposit and asset productivity in terms of returns on assets. The deposit productivity estimates  $(\hat{\delta})$  correspond to the specification reported in column 2 of Table 2. The asset productivity estimates  $(\hat{\phi})$  correspond to the specification reported in column 5 of Table 3.

liquidity provision, is a key activity linked to bank value. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 6 examine the relationship between overall deposit productivity and our subcategory estimates for savings deposits, small-time deposits, large-time deposits, and transaction deposits.[23] As before, the productivity measures are standardized. All of the subcategory measures are positively correlated with our overall deposit productivity measure. The correlation is strongest for savings deposit productivity. This is not simply driven by the composition of bank deposits. A one-standard-deviation increase in savings deposit productivity is associated with a 0.52-standard-deviation increase in total deposit productivity, though savings deposits compose only  $39\%$  of a bank's total deposits on average. In addition, we obtain similar estimates for small-time deposits (which are typically insured) and large-time deposits (which are typically uninsured),

Figure 4 Deposit productivity share

This figure displays the distribution of the share of bank value from deposits forearm bank. Observations are at the bank by quarter level. The share of bank value from deposits reflects the percentage of bank value generated by deposit productivity relative to asset productivity. We calculate the share of bank value from

deposits (Deposit Value Share) as Deposit Value Share  $j_{t} = \frac{\widetilde{Deposits / A}\frac{\hat{\delta}j_{t}}{\hat{\alpha}} + \kappa_{1}}{\widetilde{Deposits / A}\frac{\hat{\delta}j_{t}}{\hat{\alpha}} + \kappa_{1} + \exp(\hat{\phi}_{j_{t}})\exp(\Gamma\tilde{X}_{j_{t}})\tilde{A}_{j_{t}}^{\theta - 1} + \kappa_{2}}$

As discussed in Section 3, the scaling converts deposit and asset productivity in terms of returns on assets. To construct the Deposit Value Share, we fix bank characteristics  $A$ ,  $X$ ,  $Deposits / A$  at their median values (denoted by  $\sim$ ), such that the variation in the Deposit Value Share is driven by variation in deposit and asset productivity. Our measures of deposit and asset productivity reflect cross-sectional variation in deposit and asset productivity, not the levels. To calculate Deposit Value Share share we need to make normalizing assumptions about the level of deposit and asset productivity  $(\kappa_{1}$  and  $\kappa_{2}$ ). We normalize the deposit productivity distribution  $(\kappa_{1})$  relative to 3-month LIBOR such that the set of banks that offer deposit rates above 3-month LIBOR has negative deposit productivity. Specifically, we calculate a bank's expected deposit rate as a function of its deposit productivity by regressing a bank's deposit rate on its deposit productivity and time fixed effects. We assume those banks whose expected deposit rate, conditional on deposit productivity, is equal to 3-month LIBOR do not generate any value from their level of deposit productivity. For banks paying less than 3-month LIBOR, deposit productivity contributes positively to value. The term  $\kappa_{2}$  is a normalizing constant where we normalize the level of asset productivity relative to 5-year Constant Maturity Treasury rates such that the set of banks earning risk-adjusted returns below the 5-year Treasury rate has negative asset productivity. We censor those observations with negative deposit value shares at zero and those observations with deposit value shares greater than 1 at 1. The deposit and asset productivity estimates correspond to the specifications reported in column 2 of Table 2 and column 5 of Table 3.

suggesting that our productivity estimates are not driven by differences in the quantity and pricing of insured versus uninsured deposits across banks.

Columns 3 and 4 of Table 6 display the relationship between asset productivity and our asset-side subcategory measures, which are lending productivity and securities productivity.[24] Our asset productivity measure is more highly correlated with loan productivity than with securities productivity. This accords with intuition: banks have more scope to use their screening and

The table displays the relationship between our more refined measures of productivity, overall productivity, and market-to-book ratio. Observations are at the bank by quarter level. Overall deposit productivity is the dependent variable in columns 1 and 2 and is standardized. We measure overall deposit productivity using the demand estimates reported in column 2 of Table 2. Overall asset productivity is the dependent variable in columns 3 and 4 and is standardized. We measure overall asset productivity using the production function estimates reported in column 5 of Table 3. Market-to-book ratio is the dependent variable in columns 5 and 6. We measure deposit productivity for savings deposits, small-time deposits, large deposits, and transaction deposits using the corresponding demand estimates reported in Internet Appendix Table A1. We measure asset productivity for loans and savings deposits using the corresponding production function estimates reported in Internet Appendix Table A2. These subcategory measures of deposit and asset productivity are standardized. Other controls include log assets (lagged by 1 year); leverage (lagged by one quarter); 3-month returns (lagged by one quarter); equity beta; the standard deviation of the (net of losses) return on interest-bearing assets; the standard deviation of return on assets; the share of deposit liabilities; and the share of assets in loans and securities. Standard errors are reported in parentheses and are cluster bootstrapped at the bank level ( $n = 1,000$ ) to account for the two-stage estimation procedure.  $^* p < .1$ ;  $^{**}p < .05$ ;  $^{***}p < .01$ .

monitoring technologies to generate excess returns in loan markets than in securities markets.

Finally, columns 5 and 6 link our subcategory productivity measures to banks' M/B. The results suggest that not all deposits are created equal: columns 5 and 6 suggest that the main driver of bank value is savings deposits, with transaction deposits a distant second. In column 6, savings deposit productivity explains over three times as much variation in M/B as any other subcategory productivity measure.

Why are saving deposits so strongly correlated with value? A key part of the answer, as Equation (12) shows, is that the price elasticity of demand is negatively correlated with value. We find that demand for savings deposits is almost completely inelastic.[25] This means that a bank that is good at gathering savings deposits can gather them at very low rates. In contrast, demand for time deposits is quite elastic, so they contribute little to value; a less productive bank

can always offer a time deposit rate slightly higher than the most productive bank and collect more time deposits.

These decompositions have interesting implications for mapping our results back to theory. Our results in Section 3 suggest that liabilities are an important source of bank value. However, the liabilities that are most strongly associated with deposit productivity are not transaction deposits, which provide the most liquidity services. Instead, the source of most liability-side bank value comes from savings deposits, which provide limited transaction services relative to checking deposits. On the asset side, we find that loans create more value than securities.

3.4.2 Our productivity measures and balance sheet composition. Another way to understand what products and business lines drive our productivity measures is to examine how they correlate with banks' balance sheet composition. If there is within-bank variation in subcategory productivity (i.e., a single bank has different productivity for C&I loans, CRE loans, residential mortgages, etc.), an optimizing bank will tilt its portfolio toward high-productivity subcategories. Thus, the relationship between balance sheet composition and our asset and deposit productivity measures, which aggregate over subcategories, reveals which subcategories the bank perceives to have the highest productivity.

In Table 7, we examine the correlations between our deposit productivity measure and the composition of the liability side of banks' balance sheets. Both the dependent and independent variables are standardized. Column 1 shows that while banks with higher deposit productivity have higher leverage, the effect is tiny: a one-standard-deviation increase in deposit productivity is associated with a 0.02-standard-deviation increase in bank leverage. Hence, banks that are particularly good at raising deposits do not appear to lever up much more than other banks.

Table 7 displays correlations between our asset productivity measure and banks' asset composition. Columns 1-3 show that more productive banks tend to hold more real estate loans and more loan commitments (credit lines). This is consistent with the idea that more productive banks have better screening and monitoring technologies that allow them to make loans with high risk-adjusted returns. Overall, we find strong evidence that our productivity measures are capturing meaningful information about bank-specific business line specialization.

## 4. What Drives Differences in Productivity?

What are the underlying sources of variation in our productivity measures? The industrial organization literature finds that a number of variables including technology, quality of inputs, market power, and firm structure are primary drivers of nonfinancial firms' productivity (Syverson, 2011). In the context

Panels A and B display the relationship between a bank's productivity and its liability and asset structure. Observations in both panels are at the bank by quarter level. In panel A, we regress bank leverage and the composition of its deposits on deposit productivity. We measure deposit productivity using the demand estimates reported in column 2 of Table 2. In panel B, we regress the composition of a bank's assets on asset productivity. We measure asset productivity using the estimates reported in column 5 of Table 3. Other controls include log assets (lagged by 1 year); leverage (lagged by one quarter); 3-month returns (lagged by one quarter); equity beta; the standard deviation of the (net of losses) return on interest-bearing assets; and the standard deviation of return on assets. Standard errors are reported in parentheses and are cluster bootstrapped at the bank level  $(n = 1,000)$  to account for the two-stage estimation procedure.  $^* p < .1$ ;  $^{**}p < .05$ ;  $^{***}p < .01$ .

of banks, explanations for differences in productivity can be categorized broadly as being either "technological" or "customer based." Customer-based explanations for variation in bank productivity are ones in which two banks would have the same productivity if they had the same customers. This category includes differences in productivity due to market power, customer sophistication, or customer price elasticities. Technological explanations for variation in productivity are ones in which two banks would have different productivities even if they had the same customers. This category includes differences in quality of inputs, variety of products, or sophistication in price-setting or marketing strategies.

In this section, we use additional data sources to show that our deposit and asset productivity measures appear to be driven by both technological and customer-based explanations. Despite the difficulty in fully decomposing our productivity measures into either customer based or technological sources, and given that we only have rough proxies for each and that the two broad sources may be intimately related (Syverson 2004; Holmes, Levine, and Schmitz 2012), these results provide additional insight into the factors driving our asset and deposit productivity measures and hence bank value.

## 4.1 Customers

To examine customer-based explanations for variation in our productivity measures, we analyze the demographic and geographic correlates of our productivity measures in Table 8, panel A. We combine county-level Census data with the FDIC's Summary of Deposits to compute average demographic characteristics of the counties where a bank operates, weighted by the fraction of the bank's deposits in each county. Column 1 shows the correlation between asset productivity and these demographic characteristics. There is a concave, increasing relationship between asset productivity and population. Banks in higher-population areas have higher asset productivity, but the relationship fades as population increases since the coefficients for the squared terms are negative. Banks in high house price areas also have higher asset productivity. Market power also appears to matter. Banks with high asset productivity tend to operate in less competitive areas, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) of mortgage originations from Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data.

In column 2, we add geographic fixed effects to flexibly control for other unobservables. Specifically, we regress asset productivity on 387 dummy variables, each of which indicates whether the bank operates in a particular MSA. We use MSA dummies rather than county dummies to keep the number of independent variables manageable. The  $R^2$  of the regression in column 2 is  $25\%$ , suggesting that demographic and geographic variation explain a significant fraction of asset productivity. Columns 3 and 4 repeat these exercises for deposit productivity with similar results. Interestingly, the age of bank branches is strongly correlated with deposit productivity, possibly reflecting that older branches have over time isolated the stickiest deposits.

These results suggest that customer-based explanations play a large role in explaining variation in our deposit productivity and asset productivity measures. However, Table 8, panel B, shows that even after controlling for MSA fixed effects and directly including demographic characteristics and market concentration variables in our regressions, our main findings continue to hold: our productivity measures are still strongly related to bank value, and deposit productivity continues to have a larger impact than asset productivity. In total, demographic and geographic variables explain about  $40\%$  of the variation in M/B, suggesting there is significant remaining variation for technological differences in productivity to explain.

## 4.2 Technology: Consumer complaints

Next, we turn to technological sources of variation in productivity by examining the quality of services offered by the bank. We supplement our baseline data with data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Consumer Complaint Database. The CFPB collects data on consumer complaints filed over the period 2011-2015 on various financial products. We manually match firm names in the CFPB database to 79 bank holding companies in our baseline

In panel A, we show how deposit and asset productivity correlate with the geographic characteristics of areas where banks operate. In panel B, we replicate our baseline set of results controlling for fixed effects for each MSA a bank operates in. Observations in both tables are at the bank by quarter level. We measure deposit and asset productivity using the estimates reported in column 2 of Table 2 and column 5 of Table 3. Other controls include log assets (lagged by 1 year); leverage (lagged by one quarter); 3-month returns (lagged by one quarter); equity beta; the standard deviation of the (net of losses) return on interest-bearing assets; the standard deviation of return on assets; the share of deposit liabilities; and the share of assets in loans and securities. Standard errors in panel A are clustered at the bank level and are reported in parentheses. The demographic controls used in panel B are the same variables shown in panel A. The standard errors in panel B are cluster bootstrapped at the bank level  $(n = 1,000)$  to account for the two-stage estimation procedure for the independent variables.  $^* p < .1$ ;  $^{**}p < .05$ ;  $^{***}p < .01$ .

data set. We measure the quality of services a bank offers as the number of complaints it receives in a given year per dollar of deposits it collects ( $CFPBComplaints_{jt}$ ), winsorized at the  $5\%$  level.

Columns 1 and 2 of Table 9 display the correlations between deposit productivity and our external measure of bank quality, CFPB complaints. The results suggest that banks that are more deposit productive offer better customer service. This result is consistent with Egan, Hortaçsu, and Matvos (2017), who

The table displays the relationship between productivity and the quality of services a bank offers. Observations are at the bank by quarter level. The dependent variable in columns 1 and 2 is deposit productivity, and the dependent variable in columns 3 and 4 is asset productivity. We measure deposit and asset productivity using the estimates reported in column 2 of Table 2 and column 5 of Table 3. The key independent variable of interest is CFPB Complaints. CFPB Complaints measures the number of complaints a bank receives in a given year per dollar of deposits collected and is standardized. Observations are at the bank by year level. Other controls include log assets (lagged by 1 year); leverage (lagged by one quarter); 3-month returns (lagged by one quarter); equity beta; the standard deviation of the (net of losses) return on interest-bearing assets; the standard deviation of return on assets; the share of deposit liabilities; and the share of assets in loans and securities.

find that banks with larger brand effects receive fewer complaints per depositor. Columns 3 and 4 of Table 9 examine the relationship between asset productivity and CFPB complaints. There is little relationship between asset productivity and the number of CFPB complaints a firm receives. To the extent that asset productivity measures the investment and risk management skill of a bank, it is not surprising that we do not find a relationship between asset productivity and CFPB complaints.

## 4.3 Technology: Rate setting

Finally, we examine another technological source of variation in productivity: firm structure decisions and pricing technology. Specifically, we look at the relationship between a bank's rate-setting technology and productivity.

We examine the variation in deposit and mortgage rates offered by a bank. The idea is that banks with more sophisticated rate-setting technologies will offer location-specific rates that depend on local demand conditions. Specifically, we first calculate the median 3-month certificate of deposit rate and 30-year fixed mortgage rate offered at the bank by county by year level.[26] We then calculate the standard deviation of certificate of deposit and mortgage rates across the counties a bank operates in for each year,  $\sigma_{CDjt}$  and  $\sigma_{MTGjt}$ . Table 10 shows the correlations between asset and deposit productivity and our measures of rate setting sophistication. In general, banks that set more heterogeneous deposit and mortgage rates are more deposit and asset productive, respectively.

Overall, the results in this section suggest that both customer-based and technological sources of variation are important in driving our productivity measures. What prevents banks from investing to decrease differences in

The table displays the relationship between productivity and the variation in rates set by banks. Each column corresponds to a separate linear regression. Observations in each column are at the bank by quarter level. The dependent variable in columns 1 and 2 is deposit productivity as measured using the demand estimates reported in column 2 of Table 2. The dependent variable in columns 3 and 4 is asset productivity as measured using the production function estimates reported in column 5 of Table 3. The independent variables Variation in Deposit Rates and Variation in Mortgage Rates are standardized and measure the standard deviation of deposit and mortgage rates offered by a bank across the counties it operates in a given year. Other controls include log assets (lagged by 1 year); leverage (lagged by one quarter); 3-month returns (lagged by one quarter); equity beta; the standard deviation of the (net of losses) return on interest-bearing assets; the standard deviation of return on assets; the share of deposit liabilities; and the share of assets in loans and securities.

productivity over time? As Syverson (2004b) and Hsieh and Klenow (2009) show, differences in productivity are generally large and persistent across firms, and there is no reason to think that banks are any different than other types of firms. If anything, banks may face even greater frictions that could limit the convergence of productivity over time. For example, switching costs and information frictions (i.e., relationship lending) are likely to be very important for banks relative to other types of firms, and these factors can significantly limit convergence. As our results in Table 8, panel A, show, the set of customers a bank has captured through its branch network is a key driver of deposit productivity. Because these customers are sticky, it is difficult for other banks to induce them to switch, which makes it difficult for some banks to achieve the high deposit productivity enjoyed by other banks. In addition, labor market search frictions in the spirit of Eeckhout and Kircher (2018) may also affect the matching of workers to firms in a manner that limits productivity convergence. For instance, our evidence in Table 9 shows that banks could increase their deposit productivity if they improved their customer service and reduced the number of CFPB complaints filed against them. However, labor market frictions may prevent banks from finding employees who can provide better customer service.

## 5. Robustness

We find that banks that are more productive in raising deposits and generating asset income have higher M/B ratios, with deposit productivity accounting for twice as much of bank value as asset productivity. In this section, we show that these general findings hold under a host of alternative specifications. We

explore alternative data, functional forms, and methodologies, including other measures of bank efficiency that have been commonly used in the literature. For brevity, we provide an overview of our robustness checks and findings and relegate many of the details to the Internet Appendix.

## 5.1 Alternative production function and demand estimates

We first consider an alternative methodology to compute deposit and asset productivity that directly measures differences in average bank interest expense and interest income. An advantage of this alternative methodology is that both deposit and asset productivity are calculated in parallel fashion, which helps reduce concerns that our findings are driven by the specific approach used to calculate deposit and asset productivity. A drawback is that this alternative methodology does not have a structural interpretation; that is, it does not emerge from a model of optimizing banks and consumers. This means it would be more difficult for us to conduct our analysis of the level of bank value with this methodology.

We construct our alternative measure of deposit productivity based on the following regression:

$$
i _ {j t} = \alpha \ln D e p _ {j t} + \beta X _ {j t} + \psi_ {j} + \psi_ {t} + \eta_ {j t}. \tag {14}
$$

Observations are at the bank by quarter level. The dependent variable is a bank's average net of fee deposit interest expense. The control variables include a bank's log deposits and the other controls in our baseline deposit demand specification (Equation (6)), which are a bank's number of branches, noninterest expense, and number of employees. The idea is that we want to measure a bank's average deposit interest cost conditional on the size of the bank and the quality of the services it offers. We also include bank and time fixed effects to capture bank-specific differences in interest expense (i.e., deposit productivity) and common trends across banks over time.

We estimate Equation (14) using two-stage least squares to address the concern that deposits are endogenous in the regression. We use our same set of instruments (pass-through and BLP instruments) as exogenous shifters in the size of the bank in terms of its deposits. We construct our corresponding alternative measure of deposit productivity based on the residual from Equation (14) and the bank fixed effects. Notice that a large residual from eq. (14) indicates that the bank's interest expense is higher than expected, given bank characteristics  $\ln Dep_{jt}$  and  $X_{jt}$ . Thus, we multiply by -1 so that our alternative measure of deposit productivity is given by

$$
\hat {\delta} _ {j t} ^ {A l t.} = \hat {\alpha} \ln D e p _ {j t} + \hat {\beta} X _ {j t} + \hat {\psi} _ {t} - i _ {j t} = - \left(\hat {\psi} _ {j} + \hat {\eta} _ {j t}\right).
$$

A higher measure of deposit productivity indicates that, all else equal, a bank is collecting a given amount of deposits at a lower cost.

We construct our alternative measure of asset productivity based on the analogous regression

$$
\iota_ {j t} = \theta \ln A _ {j t} + \Gamma X _ {j t} + \varphi_ {j} + \varphi_ {t} + \zeta_ {j t}. \tag {15}
$$

Observations are at the bank by quarter level. This specification parallels Equation (8), except that the dependent variable is a bank's average interest income net of gains/losses  $(\iota_{jt} = \frac{Y_{jt}}{A_{jt}})$  rather than the log of a bank's interest income net of gains/losses  $\ln Y_{jt}$ . We include the same control variables as in our baseline estimates reported in Section 2.3 (Equation (8)), which include bank assets, leverage, measures of risk, and other bank characteristics (e.g., number of branches). We include time fixed effects to capture common trends in bank returns. The objects of interest are the bank fixed effects  $\varphi_j$  and the bankand time-specific residual  $\zeta_{jt}$ . The bank fixed effects measure persistent differences across banks in their ability to generate risk-adjusted returns, and the residual  $\zeta_{jt}$  measures within bank variation in a bank's ability to generate risk-adjusted returns over time.

We estimate Equation (15) using two-stage least squares to address the concern that assets are endogenous in the regression. We use our same instruments as exogenous shifters, the deposit productivity and characteristics of a bank's competitors, to instrument for interest-bearing assets  $(\ln A_{jt})$ . We construct our corresponding alternative measure of asset productivity based on the residual from Equation (15) and the bank fixed effects:

$$
\hat {\phi} _ {j t} ^ {A l t.} = \iota_ {j t} - \hat {\theta} \ln A _ {j t} + \hat {\Gamma} X _ {j t} + \hat {\varphi} _ {t} = \left(\hat {\varphi} _ {j} + \hat {\zeta} _ {j t}\right).
$$

Here, a high measure of asset productivity indicates that a firm generates higher income from a given asset base and level of risk.

Using these alternative measures of asset and deposit productivity, we replicate our baseline results and report the corresponding results in Table 11. The results in indicate that our alternative measures of both deposit and asset productivity are positively and significantly correlated with bank value (Equation (9)), but that deposit productivity explains a greater share of the variation in bank M/B. Overall, these results suggest that our findings are not driven by the specific functional forms used to compute deposit and asset productivity.

# 5.2 Comparison with the literature

Our measures of deposit and asset productivity are related to, but fundamentally distinct from, existing measures of bank efficiency, such as Berger and Mester's (1997) cost efficiency measure. In particular, our measures isolate different aspects of a bank's production function relative to existing measures. To make these differences clear, we focus on how our measure of deposit productivity relates to Berger and Mester (1997)'s measure of cost efficiency. Berger and Mester (1997) measure cost efficiency as bank costs  $C$ , conditional on output

The table displays the results corresponding to the regression of banks' market-to-book ratio on bank deposit and asset productivity. Observations are at the bank by quarter level. The dependent variable is the bank's market-to-book ratio. We construct deposit productivity as the residual and bank fixed effect from the regression of a bank's average net of fee interest expense on log bank deposits and a vector of control variables. Similarly, we construct asset productivity as the residual and bank fixed effect from the regression of a bank's average net of losses interest income on log interest-bearing assets and a vector of control variables that capture bank risk. Both deposit and asset productivity are standardized. Other controls include log assets (lagged by 1 year); leverage (lagged by one quarter); 3-month returns (lagged by one quarter); equity beta; the standard deviation of the (net of losses) return on interest-bearing assets; the standard deviation of return on assets; the share of deposit liabilities; and the share of assets in loans and securities. Standard errors are reported in parentheses and are cluster bootstrapped at the bank level  $(n = 1,000)$  to account for the two-stage estimation procedure.  $^* p < .1$ ;  $^{**}p < .05$ ;  $^{***}p < .01$ .

$y$  (loans and securities), input prices  $w$  (wages, interest rate on deposits, and interest rate on nondeposit liabilities), fixed netputs  $z$  (off-balance-sheet guarantees, physical capital, and financial equity capital), and environmental variables  $v$ . Assuming that efficiency is multiplicatively separable from the rest of the cost function, as in Berger and Mester (1997), the bank's cost function can be written as

$$
\ln C _ {j} = f \left(w _ {j}, y _ {j}, z _ {j}, v _ {j}\right) + \ln u _ {j}.
$$

The residual term  $u_{j}$  is a bank-specific inefficiency factor that measures a bank's costs relative to the best-practice level.[27] The key distinction between our measure of deposit productivity and cost efficiency is that cost efficiency is calculated conditional on the size of a bank's liabilities and the interest rate it pays on those liabilities. By controlling for both the size of a bank's liabilities and the interest rate the bank pays on its deposits and other liabilities, bank efficiency is calculated conditional on how cheaply a bank can raise a given amount of liabilities, which depends on a bank's deposit productivity. Thus, bank efficiency, by construction, does not capture differences in bank deposit productivity. Cost efficiency is effectively calculated conditional on deposit productivity. Indeed, in our simple model in Section 1, all banks would have the same cost efficiency regardless of their deposit and asset productivity. The reason is that cost efficiency is calculated conditional on a bank's cost of collecting deposits. Cost efficiency and our productivity measures are simply designed to capture different economic forces.

Figure 5 Bank efficiency versus deposit productivity

This figure displays a binned scatter plot of bank deposit productivity versus bank efficiency. Observations are at the bank by quarter level. Bank efficiency is calculated per Berger and Mester (1997), as discussed in the Internet Appendix. The deposit productivity estimates correspond to the specification reported in column 2 of Table 2.

In practice, we might still expect deposit productivity to be correlated with bank efficiency. For instance, high deposit productivity could in part reflect good management, which could also affect cost efficiency. To help further understand how our findings relate to the previous literature, we directly follow the methodology in Berger and Mester (1997) to construct cost efficiency  $C$  with our updated bank holding company data set; the full details are in the Internet Appendix. Figure 5 displays a binned scatter plot of deposit productivity and cost efficiency. As expected, the two are positively and significantly correlated, but the correlation is relatively low at 0.16.

# 5.3 Other robustness

Alternative functional forms In the Internet Appendix, we also reestimate our baseline deposit demand and asset production functions using other alternative functional forms and more granular data. On the deposits side, we reestimate our baseline demand function using more granular data at the bank by county level. County-level data allow us to construct deposit productivity measures that are fully purged of geography and that allow different banks to face consumers with different deposit rate elasticities. The county-level demand estimates are quantitatively similar to our baseline estimates and our main inference regarding the cross-section of value remains unchanged. Using county-level data, we also examine how the average demand elasticity a bank faces affects the contribution of deposit productivity to value. Recall from Section 1.2 that, all else equal, deposit productivity is more valuable if a bank faces an inelastic demand curve. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, we

also find that deposit productivity creates more value when a bank faces more inelastic demand for deposits.

On the asset side, we consider more flexible functional form assumptions and alternative measures of risk. One potential concern with our investment income production function estimates is that our empirical specification may not be flexible enough to capture a bank's true production function. As a robustness check, we estimate the bank's investment income production function using a spline with a five knot points. We also reestimate our bank investment income production function where we further account for differences in risk by controlling for a bank's asset composition and the Fama and French (1993) factors. We find that these alternative measures of asset productivity are positively correlated with bank value, but deposit productivity still has a larger impact on bank value.[28]

Alternative measures of value In our baseline analysis, we document the relationship between M/B and productivity. In the Internet Appendix, we verify that our main findings are robust to other measures of bank value, including Tobin's  $q$  and total market capitalization.[29]

Measurement error Because our productivity measures are estimated, they inherently contain measurement error. This may lead us to overstate the amount of variation in productivity and bias down the relationship between productivity and value. In the Internet Appendix, we employ two well-known methods to address measurement error. First, we instrument for our deposit and asset productivity measures using alternative measures of productivity. Second, we construct empirical Bayes estimates of productivity that allow us to directly account for measurement error in the distributions of deposit and asset productivity. The results suggest that most of the variation in our productivity estimates is driven by true variation in productivity rather than measurement error. Overall, we find that after accounting for measurement error, deposit productivity still explains more variation in bank value than asset productivity.

Subsample analysis We also run several robustness checks regarding the set of banks in our sample where we exclude the largest  $5\%$  of banks; observations from the financial crisis; nontraditional banks with business models not centered around deposit taking and lending; and observations in the year preceding or proceeding merger and acquisition activity. We report the corresponding

results in the Internet Appendix. In each subsample analysis, our results are both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those in our baseline analysis and indicate that both asset and deposit productivity are positively correlated with M/B but that deposit productivity has a relatively larger impact on M/B. Collectively, these results demonstrate that our findings are not driven by large money center banks, the financial crisis, M&A activity, or nontraditional banks.

# 6. Conclusion

What are the key determinants of bank value? In this paper, we draw upon the industrial organization literature to develop a simple empirical framework to answer this question. Banks can create value through three primary mechanisms: through excelling at the gathering of deposits, through excelling at the production of loans and other assets, and through synergies between loan and deposit production.

We find evidence that all three channels affect banks' market values and that their contributions vary by bank. Of the three channels, we find that a bank's ability to produce deposits is the most important factor in explaining cross-sectional variation in bank market value. In particular, we find that variation in deposit productivity accounts for about twice as much variation in bank value as variation in asset productivity. Moreover, we find that savings deposit productivity is particularly important for explaining bank value: the liabilities that are most strongly associated with value are not necessarily those that provide the most transaction and liquidity services. Under plausible additional assumptions, we reach similar conclusions about the level of bank value: it is primarily driven by deposit productivity. Overall, our paper represents the first attempt to provide evidence on all three sources of potential bank value creation within a unified framework, and to assess which theoretical levers are most important in explaining the cross-section of value.
