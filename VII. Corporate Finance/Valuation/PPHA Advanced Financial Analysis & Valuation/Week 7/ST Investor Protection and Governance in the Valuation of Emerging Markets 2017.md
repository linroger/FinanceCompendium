developed and emerging markets often exhibit significant differences in their level of commitment to effective corporate governance as well as in their regulatory frameworks for

protecting minority investors. There is a considerable body of academic research that investigates the link between investor protection, corporate governance, and firm values.<sup>1</sup> But even when armed with this evidence, investment managers face practical challenges when attempting to quantify the value adjustments attributable to governance and investor protection features for their equity investments in emerging markets. These challenges can lead to mistakes in valuations and suboptimal allocation of investments across and within markets.

Previous academic studies in this area examined accounting-based valuation ratios, such as book values of assets and earnings, which tend to vary across countries and industries partly because of differences in accounting conventions. And for this reason, use of these ratios may provide misleading inferences. First, differences in the legal environment and corporate governance norms and practices may directly influence these accounting ratios in ways that distort values. Second, market values in different countries can differ because of differences in labor costs, location, and transportation considerations, as well as differences in infrastructure across countries. These differences make it difficult for investment managers to isolate the effects of the legal environment and governance on firm values with any degree of confidence.

There are also a number of surveys, including those conducted by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and McKinsey, that tackle the question of valuation premiums that investors are willing to pay for better governed firms. But these surveys also have important limitations. For instance, an IFC survey reported that more than half of surveyed institutional investors expressed their willingness to pay at least  $10\%$  more for a better-governed

company within an emerging market (see Khanna and Zyla, 2010). Nevertheless, it cited the lack of a specific corporate governance threshold as a limitation to its reported value premiums. A McKinsey investor survey conducted in 2000 was more specific in that it provided investors with descriptions of board practices for two companies and then asked participants to report the valuation premiums for better-governed companies by country.[2] Still, none of the surveys differentiate among emerging markets in terms of their institutional features nor do they examine how country features interact with firm-level governance characteristics.

We recently conducted a survey of investment professionals that was designed to isolate and identify the effect of investor protection and governance on valuations in emerging markets. The participants included 69 institutional investors who actively invest across emerging markets. The majority of the respondents were either investment managers, portfolio/fund managers, or chief investment officers at large investment firms, investment banks, and other institutional investment investors (including family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and pension funds) in a variety of locations, including Singapore, London, Hong Kong, the Middle East, and Switzerland. For the most part, these individuals invest in minority stakes (less than  $30\%$  ownership) in their target companies and hold them for more than five years. As a consequence, such investors are expected to have a strong interest in the long-term performance of their target companies, but limited power to impose changes in governance.

Our survey participants were given an explicit valuation task, one that was designed to provide very concrete answers. Specifically, they were presented with information about a hypothetical chemical company located in Australia and asked to indicate how the firm's value would change if (1) it were instead located in an alternative emerging market that differs in terms of the quality of their legal institutions for investor protection (as reported by the

# Survey Background

Survey participants were presented with the following financial and valuation information for a hypothetical chemical company located in Australia:

Ausco Chemicals is an Australian chemical company that produces, supplies, and distributes a broad range of chemical products. Its products are sold as ingredients to personal care, pharmaceutical, home care, construction, plastic, lubricants, electronics, and other manufacturers.

The company (Ausco Chemicals) recorded  $25 billion in sales and$ 3.75 billion in EBITDA in 2016. Its EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value to EBITDA) multiple is 12.8x and its anticipated constant growth in EBITDA is 3%. The company is 100% equity financed.

The company exports all its products to international

manufacturers and its growth rate and profitability are not influenced by its location. Ausco bills all its international clients in US Dollars.

Ausco is listed on ASX (the Australian Securities Exchange). You are considering adding the company to your portfolio in a minority share investment.

Ausco has the same corporate governance score as the average of the Australian market (score of 8 on a scale of 1 to 10; 1 being the weakest).

Investors were also presented with the following measures of institutional (investor protection) and governance scores for Australia and five emerging markets shown in Figure 1.

Rule of Law and Control of Corruption measures of the World Bank-Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI)) and if (2) they had different governance scores in the different locations. The five emerging markets nations that we asked survey participants to consider—Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Mexico, and Iran—were selected based on two main criteria with two main goals in mind: (1) achieving significant variation in the quality of their institutional frameworks for investor protection and (2) their geographical dispersion while limiting the number of countries. The five countries we chose provided representation from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. And by providing survey participants with a hypothetical example in which the actual investment was identical across countries, we increased our confidence in our survey's ability to more accurately identify how a

country's legal and institutional environment along with the company's governance quality influences its valuation. We particularly asked participants to focus on these two dimensions and ignore all other political, liquidity, and currency risks for the country in question.

Our findings suggest that investors should pay particular attention to corporate governance in emerging market countries with relatively weak institutions. In particular, we find that governance affects firm values more in countries with weak institutions, such as Iran (where the implied governance and legal discount was in excess of  $50\%$ ), than in countries in relatively better investor protection, such as Malaysia (where the implied discount was  $13\%$ ).<sup>3</sup>

The results of our survey also reveal a tendency by participants to incorporate higher premiums in their cost of equity estimates than in their valuation discounts—that is, the costs of equity they report imply even larger discounts for investments in poorly governed companies in countries with weak investor protection. Our study thus suggests that even sophisticated investors can be subject to what researchers refer to as "exponential growth bias," and should thus be aware of this tendency when investing in emerging markets.

# Does Governance Influence the Investment Decision Process?

We started our survey by asking participants whether they would consider the governance features of the target company in their investment decision process. As shown

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/20297ffc-4be9-43d1-9c84-f05cf2de9744/f397be2d75e471605ec10fe40ccf4e43ca35d90d77ea468ad15cf20196eaa11c.jpg)

in Figure 2, all participants said they include governance of target firms in their investment due diligence process. The governance analysis is almost equally likely to rely on external data, such as governance ratings and scores compiled by third parties or the inclusion of the company in a governance-based index, and on internal analysis.

# Value Implications of the Investor Protection and Governance in Emerging Markets

We then asked participants to estimate the EV/EBITDA multiple and the cost of equity for the subject company, assuming it was located in each of the markets in question. In order to isolate the impact of the institutional frameworks and corporate governance, we asked participants to ignore all other political, liquidity, and currency risks for the country in question.

As reported in Figures 3 and 4, their responses suggested that the investment professionals reflect weak institutional frameworks of emerging markets and firm-level governance in steep valuation discounts and higher costs of equity. A company in Malaysia, the best overall performer among the sample of emerging markets, was given an average discount of  $13.5\%$  relative to the Australian benchmark. As the institutional frameworks and firm-level governance became progressively weaker in the cases of Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Mexico, and Iran, the valuation discounts relative to the Australian benchmark increased to  $24.1\%$ ,  $34.9\%$ ,  $43\%$ , and  $51.2\%$  respectively. The valuation of the hypothetical investment in Iran, which had the weakest institutions and governance, was  $44\%$  less than the valuation of the same

hypothetical investment in Malaysia, the emerging market with the best institutions and governance.

Similar conclusions can be drawn from the cost of equity estimates reported in Figure 4. Investment professionals tend to reflect the higher institutional and governance risks by applying higher premiums to the cost of equity. The mean cost of equity (premium relative to Australia $^5$ ) was  $12.9\%$  ( $1.9\%$ ) for Malaysia,  $14.3\%$  ( $3.3\%$ ) for Saudi Arabia,  $16.2\%$  ( $5.2\%$ ) for South Africa,  $18.3\%$  ( $7.3\%$ ) for Mexico, and  $21.4\%$  ( $10.4\%$ ) for Iran.

It is interesting to note that, with the growth assumptions of the hypothetical company, participants tend to be more conservative in their estimates of the cost of equity than in the valuation multiples they assign. More specifically, the required return premiums they reported were somewhat higher than those implied by their reported valuation multiples. The difference between the reported costs of equity relative to the costs of equity implied from their valuation estimates was relatively low for the Malaysian company  $(0.6\%)$ , but increased to  $1.9\%$  for the Iranian company. Similarly, as shown in Figure 5, the implied valuations for the Malaysian company were  $6\%$  lower than those reported in Figure 3; the investment professionals explicitly valued the company at an EV/EBITDA of  $11.07\mathrm{x}$  (Figure 3) while their implicit valuation, given the estimated discount rate of  $12.9\%$  and assumed growth of  $3\%$ , was an EV/EBITDA of  $10.4\mathrm{x}$ . The difference between the reported and implied values was higher in countries with weaker institutional and governance protection for investors. In other words, in countries where the costs of equity should be high because of weak institutions and governance, the stated cost of

5. The implied (calculated) cost of equity (COE) for the Australia-based company given its EV/EBITDA of 12.8 and the perpetual growth  $(g)$  of  $3\%$  is provided to participants as  $11\%$ . It is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model as follows:  $\mathrm{EV}_0 = \mathrm{EV}/$  EBITDA  $*\mathrm{EBITDA}_0 = \mathrm{EBITDA}_1 / (\mathrm{implied~COE} - g)$ . Or, EV/EBITDA  $*\mathrm{EBITDA}_0 = [\mathrm{EBITDA}_0*(1 + g)] / (\mathrm{implied~COE} - g)$ . By elimination, implied COE  $= (1 + g) / \mathrm{EV / EBITDA} + g$ . For the Australian company, implied COE  $= (1 + 0.03) / 12.8 + 0.03 = 11\%$ . 6. Implied COE  $= (1 + g) / \mathrm{EV / EBITDA} + g$ . The EV/EBITDA are those reported in Figure 3. For the Malaysian company, for example, implied COE  $= (1 + 0.03) / 11.07 + 0.03 = 12.3\%$ . The COE reported by participants is  $12.9\%$ . Thereby, the differential (premium) is  $0.6\% = 12.9\% - 12.3\%$ .
6. The implied valuation multiple using the Gordon Growth model and applying the COE reported by participants (Figure 4), and the perpetual growth of  $3\%$  is as follows:  $\mathrm{EV}_0 =$  implied EV/EBITDA \* EBITDA  $^ \text{心}$ $= \mathrm{EBITDA}_{1} / (\mathrm{COE - g})$  Or, implied EV/EBITDA \* EBITDA  $^ \text{心}$ $= [\mathrm{EBITDA}_{0}^{*}(1 + \mathrm{g})] / (\mathrm{COE - g})$  Therefore, Implied EV/EBITDA  $= (1 + \mathrm{g}) / (\mathrm{COE - g})$  For the Malaysian company, implied EV/EBITDA  $= (1 + 0.03) / (0.129 - 0.03) =$ $10.4x.$  The discrepancy in value is calculated as: (Reported EV/EBITDA - Implied EV/EBITDA)/Reported EV/EBITDA  $= (10.4 - 11.07) / 11.07 = 6\%$

In estimating the new EV/EBITDA multiple, please focus only on:

(1) the country's institutional frameworks of relevance to investors' protection, and  
(2) the company's corporate governance and transparency score.

Please ignore all other political, liquidity, and currency risks for the country in question.

equity relative to the cost of equity implied by the participants' valuation estimates was especially large.

As we mentioned in the introduction, the discrepancy between the values and the cost of equity estimates is consistent with what is known as "exponential growth

bias." A study by Stango and Zinman (2009) provides evidence that individual investors exhibit this tendency to underestimate the implications of compounding<sup>8</sup>—that is, they tend to "linearize" exponential functions when they assess them intuitively and, in so doing, they underestimate

the long-term effects of, for example, increasing the interest rate from  $12\%$  to  $14\%$ . The evidence in our survey of institutional investors indicates that this bias is potentially important, even for quite sophisticated investors.

# The Drivers of the Value Adjustments

How can the above valuation discounts be interpreted? For example, is the discounted value of the Iranian investment attributable mainly to the weak investor protection afforded by Iranian laws and regulations, or to the lax governance of individual companies? This part of the survey, which investigates the interplay of investor protection and corporate governance, allowed us to explore the impact of each of these factors on the observed valuation adjustments.

# How is the Valuation Influenced by the Institutional Frameworks for Investor Protection and the Company Governance Scores?

Figure 6 displays the importance (or "impact weighting") that participants assigned to each of the institutional frameworks

and corporate governance dimensions when estimating the EV/EBITDA multiple of the company for each of the emerging markets. Participants placed higher importance for the legal frameworks in Malaysia, where the institutional environments and procedures for investor protection are relatively acceptable. The institutional environments in Malaysia were associated with an average valuation discount of  $7.7\%$  -which represents  $57\%$  of the overall discount of  $13.6\%$  relative to the value of a comparable Australian company-while the corporate governance standing was associated with a discount of  $5.8\%$ .

Interestingly, the impact weighting assigned to firm-level governance actually increases as the quality of the countries' institutions deteriorates. Weak firm-level governance, for instance, accounted for  $60\%$  of the Iranian company's value discount (as compared to  $43\%$  for Malaysia). The results suggest that investment professionals tend to rely more on effective governance at the firm-level when they become more concerned about the protection of their rights under weak legal frameworks. When the institutional backgrounds

are weaker, investors face more serious risks associated with extraction of private gains, unfriendly litigation processes, and unreliable enforcement of contracts. These findings are consistent with previous research that suggests that firm-level governance can act as a partial substitute for weak legal frameworks.[9]

# Governance Premiums and the Interplay Between Investor Protection and Firm-Level Governance

To better understand the dynamics of the relationship between the institutional frameworks, firm-level governance, and the value of emerging market companies, we asked participants to provide their estimates of the valuation multiples and cost of equity for the company assuming that it has the higher governance score of the Australian company (i.e. score of 8). Posing the question in this way allowed us to accomplish three goals of our survey: (1) quantify the valuation premium that investment professionals attribute to improvements in firm-level governance; (2) isolate and assess the impact of the institutional risks on the value by assuming that the subject company has the same firm-level governance score in all international markets; and (3) examine whether and how corporate governance can substitute for non-investor friendly environments.

The results in Figure 7 are consistent with previous research that suggests that investors are willing to pay considerable premiums for better-governed companies. For example, the investors' responses to this part of our survey suggest that the Malaysian company would realize a premium of  $7.4\%$  by improving its governance score from 6.5 to 8. At the other extreme, the Iranian company could realize a  $42.4\%$  premium if it improves its governance score from 3 to 8. On average, our survey participants expressed a willingness to pay a premium for the best-governed company of  $24.5\%$  relative

to a company of average governance in the same country.

Figure 8 reports the valuation discounts of the company located in each emerging market relative to its counterpart based in Australia and relative also to the next best emerging market. Since all companies are assumed to have the same governance score, the valuation discounts are attributable entirely to the weaker institutional settings in each market. The valuation discount of the Malaysian company relative to the Australian counterpart drops to  $7\%$  (from the  $14\%$  reported in Figure 3); and the discount of the Iranian company shrinks to  $30\%$  (from the  $51\%$  reported earlier). The average discount for all the emerging countries drops from  $33\%$  to  $19\%$ .

These findings provide support for the argument that improvements in firm-level governance can at least partly counterbalance the effect of weak protection of investors' rights. Studies have provided evidence of high-quality governance in large numbers of companies domiciled in countries with less investor-friendly institutions, and have shown that the valuation premiums for good governance in these countries tend to be greater than in countries with stronger investor protection.

Figure 9 displays the cost of equity estimates under the revised assumption that the subject company has a governance score equivalent to its Australian counterpart. Investment professionals still assigned higher discount rates to the weaker institutional frameworks. However, the costs of equity estimates for the better governed companies are lower than those of their poorly governed counterparts, which is consistent with the results reported in Figure 4. On average, the estimates reported in Figure 9 suggest that a company in an emerging market can reduce its cost of equity by  $2.5\%$  by improving its governance. And a company that succeeds in raising its governance score from 3 to 8 (such

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/20297ffc-4be9-43d1-9c84-f05cf2de9744/50ac10da3bbe151e228a8b7632d3d05a3732449d75d5314700611bdb64646bb0.jpg)

as the Iranian company mentioned earlier) is expected to reduce its cost of equity by  $4.7\%$ .

The findings in Figure 9 also reflect the tendency of investment professionals, noted earlier, to incorporate premiums into their discount rates that are higher than those implied by their valuation multiples. For instance, their reported cost of equity for the Iranian company of  $16.7\%$  was more than  $2\%$  higher than the cost of equity implied by the  $8.9\mathrm{x}$  EV/EBITDA multiple reported in Figure 7. Similar to our earlier reported finding, this differential was lower in the countries with better investor protection and shrinks to  $0.3\%$  in the case of Malaysia, the country with the best legal and regulatory systems in our sample.

# How Important are Specific Governance Features to the Investment Analysis?

In this section, we dig deeper into the effects of specific firm-level governance features on the valuation and investment

considerations. We asked participants to weight the importance of different governance components listed in Figure 11.

As summarized in Figure 11, the results suggest that within the firm-level governance dimension, investment decisions are most heavily influenced by concerns relating to the following three variables: (1) transparency and disclosures; (2) ownership structures and investor rights; and (3) the quality of the audit.

Access to transparent and reliable information is, of course, a pillar of investors' selection process. The responses of investors participating in our survey imply that they typically perform thorough due diligence when investing in emerging markets companies in order to limit their risks and vulnerability to weaker regulatory environments. Concerns about inadequate disclosure weigh heavily on the investment analysis; in fact, investors gave the effectiveness of disclosure an average impact weighting of  $29\%$  out of the

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-29/20297ffc-4be9-43d1-9c84-f05cf2de9744/702673f93745935cb4aa867b56607ae3b284d4a0821912494882289986f82b8e.jpg)

list of governance factors. In the following section, we dig deeper to investigate how particular disclosure deficiencies can impact the investment decision.

According to our survey participants, the ownership structures and protection of investor rights is another major concern for investors in emerging market companies. Moreover, similar to the case of disclosure, the average weight for this governance component across markets was  $28\%$ . Also worth noting is our participants' assignment of greater importance to ownership structures and investor rights in South Africa, Mexico, and Iran than in the markets with stronger legal frameworks. This observation reflects serious investor concern about emerging countries in which weak investor protection is coupled with substantial ownership by government-backed entities, limited protection of the rights of minority shareholders,

and complex and concentrated ownership structures. $^{11}$  In such environments, concentrated ownership structures are likely to be perceived as especially risky, given the power and incentives of controlling shareholders to expropriate the rights of minority shareholders.

The quality of the audit systems and procedures is also one of the major concerns of sophisticated investors—with an average assigned weight of  $22\%$ . Effective audit systems can mitigate some of the risks associated with the excessive power held by potentially self-dealing inside blockholders.

By contrast, board structure and effectiveness, and the nature of the largest shareholders, were viewed by survey participants as having relatively little impact on the valuation of emerging market firms. While institutional investors do not deny their importance in the governance framework, they do not consider them among the major influences on value.

# What is the Most Critical Information?

Finally, we asked participants to identify the financial and governance information that is most essential to their investment process—information without which they would not consider investing in an emerging market company.

# Can Insufficient Financial Disclosures Break an Investment Decision?

As reported in Figure 12, the vast majority of our respondents said that a lack of access to full annual reports, audited financial statements, and detailed financial statements for group companies would very likely rule out an investment in the company.

Other disclosure deficiencies, such as failure to announce shareholder meetings, strategic plans, or major

corporate events, failure to make disclosures in English and other widely used languages, lack of access to historical quarterly financial statements beyond three years or to management discussion of performance were all viewed as serious challenges to the screening process but were less likely to represent deal stoppers. Less than  $30\%$  of the participants said they would disregard the investment due to these disclosure deficiencies.

# Can Insufficient Governance and Audit Disclosures Break an Investment Decision?

As reported in Figure 13, companies that do not disclose information about related party transactions were the most likely to be ruled out by investment professionals. Related party transactions raised major concerns about the exercise

# The Case of Grupo Financiero Banorte: Mexico's Corporate Governance Standout

A close look at the components of the Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Markets Index lends support to the argument that companies can provide internal assurance on investor protection even if they operate in weak institutional frameworks. The index includes selected companies with high standards of corporate sustainability based on economic, environmental, social, and corporate governance criteria with a strong focus on shareholder value.

Among the countries included in our sample in the 2016 Dow Jones Sustainability index, Mexico exhibited the weakest institutional performance according to the World Governance Indicators. Nevertheless, five Mexican companies managed to adopt sustainability and governance measures that granted them listing in the index. Notable among them is Grupo Financiero Banorte, the third largest bank in Mexico, and the first and only Mexican financial institution to be added to the index in 2014.

In the years leading up to 2014, Banorte was widely recognized for its commitment to governance. And its ability to weather and the strength of its recovery from the 2008 financial crisis was partly attributed to its sound governance practices. The bank was successful in realizing a remarkable share price recovery with a  $285\%$  growth over the 2009-2010 period.

In 2011, a study by Morgan Stanley recognized Banorte as one of the best governed publicly traded companies. Of Banorte's 15 board members, 11 are

independent. Its board also adopted resolutions for the protection of minority shareholders' rights and institutional strengthening.

But the general progress has had setbacks as well. In 2014, the bank experienced a power struggle between its chairman and CEO, causing a sharp drop in the share price and the resignation of both leaders. The bank's largest shareholder, the Gonzalez family, reacted by appointing the grandson of the former controlling shareholder as chairman. The move raised some governance concerns in the market. And rumors that the chairman would force a merger between Banorte and Grupo Financiero Interaciones (GFI)—a financial institution in which the family owned more than  $70\%$ —to the detriment of Banorte's minority shareholders aggravated investors' fears.

However, in 2016, the chairman proposed a change to the company's bylaws whereby any acquisition proposal involving a related party must be approved by the audit and corporate practices committee, the board, and shareholders in an attempt to secure minority shareholders' rights and alleviate investors' concerns. And at the end of 2016, Banorte was trading at a price to earnings ratio of  $15.1\mathrm{x}$  (as compared to  $8.85\mathrm{x}$  for GFI, and thus a premium of  $70.6\%$ ). Since then, Banorte has been recognized by the Ethical Boardroom Corporate Governance Awards 2017 as the best governed financial services company in South America.

and protection of minority shareholders' rights. What's more, the complex and opaque ownership structures of emerging markets companies coupled with insufficient disclosures of related party transactions were said to create serious concerns when investors cannot assess how the company's resources are channeled.

The disclosure of auditor information (such fees and services) and information about the group structure and cross-holdings were also seen as critical to the investment process according to  $65\%$  of participants. And almost half of the participants reported that a failure to disclose the company's top direct and ultimate shareholders would lead them to reject the investment. At the same time, access to information about board committees, directors' ownership information, and auditor identity were said to be important, but not necessarily essential factors in the investment decision process.

# Conclusion

Investment professionals take into account and reflect weak corporate governance and an uncertain legal environment by reducing the amount they are willing to pay when investing in emerging markets. This paper uses a unique survey design to quantify the valuation adjustments for different thresholds of investor protection and governance performance. For instance, should investments in more friendly-investor protection environments be favored regardless of the governance standings of the companies? And should investors consider corporate governance through the same lens, regardless of where an investment is located?

Our evidence suggests that corporate governance is especially important in countries with weaker investor protection. Well-governed companies located in these countries enjoy significant value premiums that can partly offset the negative impact of the poor institutional

environments, which in turn suggests that the payoff associated with better governance in these countries is quite high. Indeed, our evidence suggests that firms in countries with weak investor protection can significantly improve their valuations by implementing better governance and upgrading their disclosures practices.
