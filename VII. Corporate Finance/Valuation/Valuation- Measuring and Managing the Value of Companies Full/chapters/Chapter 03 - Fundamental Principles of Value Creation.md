## Fundamental Principles of Value Creation

Companies create value for their owners by investing cash now to generate more cash in the future. The amount of value they create is the difference between cash inflows and the cost of the investments made, adjusted to reflect the fact that tomorrow's cash flows are worth less than today's because of the time value of money and the riskiness of future cash flows. As we illustrated in Chapter 2, the conversion of revenues into cash flows—and earnings—is a function of a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) and its revenue growth. That means the amount of value a company creates is governed ultimately by its ROIC, revenue growth, and ability to sustain both over time. Keep in mind that a company will create value only if its ROIC is greater than its cost of capital. Moreover, only if ROIC exceeds the cost of capital will growth increase a company's value. Growth at lower returns actually reduces a company's value. Exhibit 3.1 illustrates this core principle of value creation.

Following these principles helps managers decide which strategies and investments will create the most value for shareholders in the long term. The principles also help investors assess the potential value of companies they might consider investing in. This chapter explains the relationships that tie together

EXHIBIT 3.1 Growth and ROIC Drive Value growth, ROIC, cash flows, and value, and it introduces the way managers can use these relationships to decide among different investments or strategies. For example, we will show that high-ROIC companies typically create more value by focusing on growth, while lower-ROIC companies create more value by increasing ROIC. We'll also explore the principle, often forgotten by executives, that anything that doesn't increase cash flows, such as noncash accounting charges or changes in accounting methods, won't create value. And we'll introduce a simple equation that captures the essence of valuation in practice.

One might expect universal agreement on a notion as fundamental as value, but this isn't the case: many executives, boards, and financial media still treat accounting earnings and value as one and the same and focus almost obsessively on improving earnings. However, while earnings and cash flow are often correlated, earnings don't tell the whole story of value creation. Focusing too much on earnings or earnings growth often leads companies to stray from a value-creating path.

For example, earnings growth alone can't explain why investors in discount retailer Costco, the fourth-largest retailer in the United States, with sales of  \$126 billion in 2017, and Brown-Forman, the producer of Jack Daniels and other alcoholic beverages, with sales of\$ 4 billion the same year, earned similar shareholder returns (dividends plus appreciation in the share price) between 1996 and 2017. These two successful companies had very different growth rates. During the period, after-tax operating profits for Costco grew 11 percent per year, while those of Brown-Forman grew 7 percent annually. This means that profits for Costco in 2017 were nine times larger than in 1996, while profits at Brown-Forman were only four times larger. Costco was one of the fastest-growing companies in the United States during this time; its average annual shareholder returns were 15 percent. Brown-Forman was growing much more slowly, yet its annual shareholder returns were also 15 percent. The reason Brown-Forman could create the same value as Costco, despite much slower growth, was that Brown-Forman earned a 29 percent ROIC (excluding the impact of acquisitions), while Costco's ROIC was 13 percent.

To be fair, if all companies in an industry earned the same ROIC, then earnings growth would be the differentiating metric, because then only growth and not ROIC would determine differences in companies' cash flow. For reasons of simplicity, analysts and academics have sometimes made this assumption. But as Chapter 8 demonstrates, returns on invested capital can vary considerably, not only across industries but also between companies within the same industry and across time.

# THE RELATIONSHIP OF GROWTH, ROIC, AND CASH FLOW

Disaggregating cash flow into revenue growth and ROIC helps illuminate the underlying elements that power a company's performance. Say a company's cash flow was  \$100 last year and will be\$ 115 next year. This doesn't tell us much about its economic performance, since the 15 increase in cash flow could come from many sources, including revenue growth, a reduction in capital spending, or a reduction in marketing expenditures. But if we told you that the company was generating revenue growth of 7 percent per year and would earn a return on invested capital of 15 percent, then you would be able to evaluate its performance. You could, for instance, compare the company's growth rate with the growth rate of its industry or the economy, and you could analyze its ROIC relative to peers, its cost of capital, and its own historical performance.

Growth, ROIC, and cash flow are mathematically linked. To see how, consider two companies, Value Inc. and Volume Inc., whose projected earnings, investment, and resulting cash flows are displayed in Exhibit 3.2. Earnings, in this illustration, are expressed as net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT), a term we use throughout the book. Both companies earned NOPAT of 100 million in year 1 and are expected to increase their revenues and earnings at 5 percent per year, so their projected earnings are identical. If the popular view that value depends only on earnings were true, the two companies' values also would be the same. But this simple example demonstrates how wrong that view can be.

1 Net operating profit after taxes.

Almost all companies need to invest in plant, equipment, or working capital to grow. Free cash flow is what's left over for investors once investments have been subtracted from earnings. Value Inc. generates higher free cash flows with the same earnings because it invests only 25 percent of its profits—its investment rate—to achieve the same profit growth as Volume Inc., which invests 50 percent of its profits. Value Inc.'s lower investment rate results in 50 percent higher cash flows each year than Volume Inc. sees while generating the same level of profits.

We can value the two companies by discounting their future free cash flows at a discount rate that reflects what investors expect to earn from investing in the companies—that is, their cost of capital. For both companies, we assumed their growth and investment rates were perpetual, and we discounted each year's cash flow to the present at a 10 percent cost of capital. So, for example, Value Inc.'s year 1 cash flow of  \$75 million has a present value of\$ 68 million today (see Exhibit 3.3). We summed each year's results to derive a total present value of all future cash flows: \$1,500 million for Value Inc. and \$1,000 million for Volume Inc.

The companies' values can also be expressed as price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es). Divide each company's value by its first-year earnings of 100 million. Value Inc.'s P/E is 15, while Volume Inc.'s is only 10. Despite identical earnings and growth rates, the companies have different earnings multiples because their cash flows are so different. Value Inc. generates higher cash flows because it doesn't have to invest as much as Volume Inc. does.

Differences in ROIC—defined here as the incremental NOPAT earned each year relative to the prior year's investment—are what drives difference in investment rates. In this case, Value Inc. invested 25 million in year

1 to increase its profits by \$5 million in year 2. Its return on new capital is 20 percent (\$5 million of additional profits divided by \$25 million of investment).³ In contrast, Volume Inc.'s return on invested capital is 10 percent (\$5 million in additional profits in year 2 divided by an investment of 50 million).

Growth, ROIC, and cash flow (as represented by the investment rate) are tied together mathematically in the following relationship:

$$
G r o w t h = R O I C \times I n v e s i t i o n R a t e
$$

Applying the formula to Value Inc.:

$$
5 \% = 20 \% \times 25 \%
$$

Applying it to Volume Inc.:

$$
5 \% = 10 \% \times 50 \%
$$

As you can see, Volume Inc. needs a higher investment rate to achieve the same growth.

Another way to look at this comparison is in terms of cash flow:

$$
\text {C a s h F l o w} = \text {E a r n i n g s} \times (1 - \text {I n v e s t m e n t R a t e})
$$

In this equation, the investment rate is equal to growth divided by ROIC:

$$
\text {C a s h F l o w} = \text {E a r n i n g s} \times (1 - \text {G r o w t h / R O I C})
$$

For Value Inc.:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \$ 75 = \$ 100\times (1 - 5\% /20\%) \\ = \$ 100 \times (1 - 25 \%) \\ \end{array}
$$

For Volume Inc.:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \$ 50 = \$ 100\times (1 - 5\% /10\%) \\ = \$ 100 \times (1 - 50 \%) \\ \end{array}
$$

Since the three variables are tied together mathematically, you can describe a company's performance with any two variables. We generally describe a company's performance in terms of growth and ROIC because, as mentioned earlier, you can analyze growth and ROIC across time and versus peers.

$\%$  of NOPAT

EXHIBIT 3.4 Translating Growth and ROIC into Cash Flow Available for Distribution

Exhibit 3.4 shows how different combinations of growth and ROIC generate different levels of cash flow that can be paid out to investors. The numbers in the boxes represent cash flow as a percentage of NOPAT, which represents the profits available for distribution to investors. You can see that as growth slows at any level of ROIC, the cash generated per dollar of NOPAT increases. That explains why even maturing companies experiencing slowing growth can pay out much larger amounts of their earnings to investors. Note also that companies with high ROIC tend to generate lots of cash flow as long as they are growing modestly. This explains why mature tech and pharma companies with high returns on capital pay out so much of their earnings to investors. They don't really have a choice, because they typically generate much more cash flow than they can reinvest at attractive returns on capital.

Note that near-term cash flow by itself may not be a meaningful performance indicator. Consider what would happen if Value Inc. were to find more investment opportunities at a 25 percent ROIC and be able to increase its growth to 8 percent per year. Exhibit 3.5 shows the projected NOPAT and cash flow. Because it would be growing faster, Value Inc. would need to invest more of its earnings each year, so its cash flow at 8 percent growth would be lower than at 5 percent growth until year 9. However, its value, which at 5 percent growth would be  \$1.5 billion, would double at 8 percent growth to\$ 3 billion, because its cash flows would be higher in the long term.

If you simplify some assumptions—for example, that a company grows at a constant rate and maintains a constant ROIC—you can reduce the discounted cash flow to a simple formula. We call this the value driver formula. Here, NOPAT represents the net operating profit after taxes,  $g$  is the growth rate of the company, and WACC is the cost of capital.

$$
\mathrm {V a l u e} = \frac {\mathrm {N O P A T} _ {t = 1} \left(1 - \frac {g}{\mathrm {R O I C}}\right)}{\mathrm {W A C C} - g}
$$

Using this equation, you can see that value is driven by growth, ROIC, and the cost of capital, just as we described in the example. In practice, we rarely use this formula by itself, because of its assumption of constant growth and ROIC forever. Still, we find it useful as a reminder of the elements that drive value. Note that improving ROIC, for any level of growth, always increases value because it reduces the investment required for growth. The impact of growth, however, is ambiguous, as it appears in both the numerator and the denominator. In the next section, we'll show that faster growth increases value only when a company's ROIC is greater than its cost of capital. At the end of this chapter, we'll also show how this equation is derived.

# BALANCING ROIC AND GROWTH TO CREATE VALUE

It is possible to create a matrix that shows how different combinations of growth and ROIC translate into value (Exhibit 3.6). Each cell in the matrix represents the present value of future cash flows under each of the assumptions of growth and ROIC, discounted at the company's cost of capital. This case assumes a 9 percent cost of capital and a company that earns 100 in the first year.

Observe that for any level of growth, value increases with improvements in ROIC. In other words, when all else is equal, a higher ROIC is always good, because it means that the company doesn't have to invest as much to achieve a given level of growth. The same can't be said of growth. When ROIC is high, faster growth increases value. But when ROIC is lower than the company's cost of capital, faster growth destroys value. When return on capital is lower than the cost of capital, growing faster means investing more at a value-destroying return. Where ROIC equals the cost of capital, we can draw the dividing line between creating and destroying value through growth. On that line, value is neither created nor destroyed, regardless of how fast the company grows. It's as if management were on a treadmill. They're working hard, but after their workout, they are right where they started.

From the exhibit, you can also see that a company with high ROIC and low growth may have a similar or higher valuation multiple than a company with

Value,  $^1$

EXHIBIT 3.6 Translating Growth and ROIC into Value

Present value of future cash flows, assuming year 1 earnings of 100 and a 9\% cost of capital. After 15 years, all scenarios grow at 4.5\%.

We made explicit cash flow forecasts for the first 15 years and assumed that growth after that point converges on 4.5 percent in all scenarios. If a company grew faster than the economy forever, it would eventually overtake the entire world economy.

higher growth but low ROIC. For example, at the end of 2017, Brown-Forman and Costco were both valued with a ratio of enterprise value to pretax operating profits in the range of 19 to 20 times. Yet Costco had been growing at 7 percent per year over the prior three years, while Brown-Forman had grown at less than 2 percent per year. Again, Brown-Forman made up for its lower growth with a higher ROIC of 30 percent in 2017, versus 15 percent for Costco (which is good for a capital-intensive, low-margin retailer).

We sometimes hear the argument that even low-ROIC companies should strive for growth. The logic is that if a company grows, its ROIC will naturally increase. However, we find this is true only for young, start-up businesses. Most often in mature companies, a low ROIC indicates a flawed business model or unattractive industry structure. Don't fall for the trap that growth will lead to scale economies that automatically increase a company's return on capital. It almost never happens for mature businesses.

# SOME EXAMPLES

The logic laid out in this section reflects the way companies perform in the stock market. Recall the earlier explanation of why shareholder returns for Costco and Brown-Forman were the same even though earnings for Costco grew much faster. Another example of the relative impact of growth and ROIC on value is Rockwell Automation, which provides integrated systems to monitor and control automation in factories. Rockwell's total shareholder returns (TSR) from 1995 to 2018 were 19 percent per year, placing it in the top quartile of industrial companies. During this period, Rockwell's revenues actually shrank from  \$13 billion in 1995 to\$ 7 billion in 2018 as it divested its aviation and power systems divisions. The major factor behind its high TSR was its success in increasing ROIC, from about 12 percent in the mid-1990s to about 35 percent in 2018 (including goodwill). After spinning off its aviation business (now known as Rockwell Collins) in 2001, Rockwell focused on its core industrial-automation business and improved ROIC significantly. While this was partially accomplished by divesting lower-margin ancillary businesses, the majority of the improvement came from operational improvement in industrial automation. The company publicly reiterated its focus on cost and capital productivity many times during the period.

Clearly, the core valuation principle applies at the company level. We have found that it applies at the sector level, too. Consider companies as a whole in the consumer packaged-goods sector. Even though well-known names in the sector such as Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive aren't high-growth companies, the market values them at average or higher earnings multiples because of their high returns on invested capital.

The typical large packaged-goods company increased its revenues 1.2 percent a year from 2014 to 2019, slower than the median of about 4.5 percent for all Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 companies, excluding financial institutions. Yet at the end of 2018, the median P/E of consumer packaged-goods companies was about 15, almost exactly the same as the median S&P 500 company. The valuations of companies in this sector rested on their high ROICs—in aggregate above 40 percent, compared with an aggregate ROIC of 22 percent for the S&P 500 in 2018.

To test whether the core valuation principle also applies at the level of countries and the aggregate economy, we compared large companies based in Europe and the United States. The median trailing P/E ratio for large U.S. companies was 15.5 times, versus 12.8 for large European companies. The difference in valuation relative to invested capital is even more extreme. The median enterprise value to invested capital for U.S. companies was 5.4, versus 3.2 for European companies. Some executives assume the reason is that investors are simply willing to pay higher prices for shares of U.S. companies (an assumption that has prompted some non-U.S. companies to consider moving their share listings to the New York Stock Exchange in an attempt to increase their value). But the real reason U.S. companies trade at higher multiples is that they typically earn higher returns on invested capital. The median large U.S. company earned a 30 percent ROIC (before goodwill and intangibles) in 2018, while the median large European company earned 19 percent. A large part of the difference is a different industry mix; the United States has many more high-ROIC pharmaceutical, medical-device, and technology companies. These broad comparisons also hide the fact that some European companies—for example, Robert Bosch in auto parts and Reckitt Benckiser in consumer packaged goods—outperform many of their U.S. counterparts.

More evidence showing that ROIC and growth drive value appears in Chapter 7.

# IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGERS

We'll dive deeper into the managerial dimensions of ROIC and growth in Chapters 8 and 9, respectively. For now, we outline several lessons managers should learn for strategic decision making.

Start by referring back to Exhibit 3.6, because it contains the most important strategic insights for managers concerning the relative impact that changes in ROIC and growth can have on a company's value. In general, companies already earning a high ROIC can generate more additional value by increasing their rate of growth, rather than their ROIC. For their part, low-ROIC companies will generate relatively more value by focusing on increasing their ROIC.

For example, Exhibit 3.7 shows that a typical high-ROIC company, such as a branded consumer packaged-goods company, can increase its value by

# EXHIBIT 3.7 Increasing Value: Impact of Higher Growth and ROIC

10 percent if it increases its growth rate by one percentage point, while a typical moderate-ROIC company, such as the average retailer, will increase its value by only 5 percent for the same increase in growth. In contrast, the moderate-ROIC company gets a 15 percent bump in value from increasing its return on invested capital by one percentage point, while the high-ROIC company gets only a 6 percent bump from the same increase in return on invested capital.

The general lesson is that high-ROIC companies should focus on growth, while low-ROIC companies should focus on improving returns before growing. Of course, this analysis assumes that achieving a one-percentage-point increase in growth is as easy as achieving a one-percentage-point increase in ROIC, everything else being constant. In reality, achieving either type of increase poses different degrees of difficulty for different companies in different industries, and the impact of a change in growth and ROIC will also vary between companies. However, every company needs to conduct the analysis to set its strategic priorities.

Until now, we have assumed that all growth earns the same ROIC and therefore generates the same value, but this is clearly unrealistic: different types of growth earn different returns on capital, so not all growth is equally value-creating. Each company must understand the pecking order of growth-related value creation that applies to its industry and company type.

Exhibit 3.8 shows the value created from different types of growth for a typical consumer products company. These results are based on cases with which we are familiar, not on a comprehensive analysis. Still, we believe they reflect the broader reality. The results are expressed in terms of value created for \$1.00 of incremental revenue. For example, \$1.00 of additional revenue from a new product creates $1.75 to $2.00 of value. The most important implication of this chart is the rank order. New products typically create more value for shareholders, while acquisitions typically create the least. The key to the difference between these extremes is differences in returns on capital for the different types of growth.

Growth strategies based on organic new-product development frequently have the highest returns because they don't require much new capital; companies can add new products to their existing factory lines and distribution systems. Furthermore, the investments to produce new products are not all required at once. If preliminary results are not promising, future investments can be scaled back or canceled.

Acquisitions, by contrast, require that the entire investment be made up front. The amount of up-front payment reflects the expected cash flows from the target plus a premium to stave off other bidders. So even if the buyer can improve the target enough to generate an attractive ROIC, the rate of return is typically only a small amount higher than its cost of capital.

To be fair, this analysis doesn't reflect the risk of failure. Most product ideas fail before reaching the market, and the cost of failed ideas is not reflected in the numbers. By contrast, acquisitions typically bring existing revenues and cash flows that limit the downside risk to the acquirer. But including the risk of failure would not change the pecking order of investments from a value-creation viewpoint.

The interaction between growth and ROIC is a key factor to consider when assessing the likely impact of a particular investment on a company's overall ROIC. For example, we've found that some very successful, high-ROIC companies in the United States are reluctant to invest in growth if it will reduce their returns on capital. One technology company had a 30 percent operating margin and ROIC of more than 50 percent, so it didn't want to invest in projects that might earn only 25 percent returns, fearing this would dilute its average returns. But as the first principle of value creation would lead you to expect, even an opportunity with a 25 percent return would still create value as long as the cost of capital was lower, despite the resulting decline in average ROIC.

The evidence backs this up. We examined the performance of 157 companies with high (greater than 20 percent) ROIC over two time periods: 1996-2005

We've also seen companies with low returns pursue growth on the assumption that this will also improve their profit margins and returns, reasoning that growth will increase ROIC by spreading fixed costs across more revenues. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, however, except at small startup companies, faster growth rarely fixes a company's ROIC problem. Low returns usually indicate a poor industry structure (as is the case with airlines in Europe and Asia), a flawed business model, or weak execution. If a company has a problem with ROIC, the company shouldn't grow until the problem is fixed.

The evidence backs this up as well. We examined the performance of 110 low-ROIC companies (the right column in Exhibit 3.9). The companies that

Airlines have traditionally suffered from overcapacity and lack of differentiation, leading to price competition and low returns. Recently, U.S. airlines, after a wave of consolidation, have been disciplined about adding capacity and creating ways to charge for services, like checking bags, with the result that returns on capital are higher than in the past.

had low growth but increased their ROICs outperformed the faster-growing companies that did not improve their ROICs.

One final factor for management to consider is the method by which it chooses to improve ROIC. A company can increase ROIC by either improving profit margins or improving capital productivity. With respect to future growth, it doesn't matter which of these paths a company emphasizes. But for current operations, at moderate ROIC levels, a one-percentage-point increase in ROIC through margin improvement will have a moderately higher impact on value relative to improving capital productivity. At high levels of ROIC, though, improving ROIC by increasing margins will create much more value than an equivalent ROIC increase by improving capital productivity. Exhibit 3.10 shows how this works for a company that has a 9 percent cost of capital.

The reason for this relationship is best explained by an example. Consider a company with zero growth,  \$1,000 of revenues,\$ 100 of profits, and \$500 of invested capital (translating to a 10 percent margin, a 50 percent ratio of invested capital to revenues, and ROIC of 20 percent). One way to increase ROIC by one percentage point is to increase the profit margin to 10.5 percent, increasing profits by \$5. Since the company is not growing, the \$5 of extra profits translates to \$5 of cash flow each year going forward. Discounting at a 10 percent cost of capital, this represents a \$50 increase in value. The company could also increase ROIC by reducing working capital. If it reduced working capital by \$24, ROIC would increase to 21 percent (\$100 divided by \$476). The company's value would increase only by the 24 one-time cash inflow from reducing working capital. Future cash flows would not be affected.

# ECONOMIC PROFIT COMBINES ROIC AND SIZE

You can also measure a company's value creation using economic profit, a measure that combines ROIC and size into a currency metric (here we use the

U.S. dollar). Economic profit measures the value created by a company in a single period and is defined as follows:

$$
E c o n o m i c \text {P r o f i t} = \text {I n v e s t e d C a p i t a l} \times (\text {R O I C} - \text {C o s t} \text {o f} \text {C a p i t a l})
$$

In other words, economic profit is the spread between the return on invested capital and the cost of capital times the amount of invested capital. Value Inc.'s economic profit for year 1 is \$50 (Value Inc. must have \$500 of starting capital if it earns 100 at a 20 percent return in year 1):

$$
\begin{array}{l} Economic Profit = \500\times (20\% -10\%) \\ = \$ 500 \times 10 \% \\ = \$ 50 \\ \end{array}
$$

Volume Inc.'s economic profit in year 1 is zero (Volume Inc. must have  \$1,000 of starting capital if it earns\$ 100 at a 10 percent return in year 1):

$$
\begin{array}{l} Economic Profit = \$ 1,000 \times (10\% - 10\%) \\ = \$ 1,000\times 0\% \\ = \$ 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

You can also value a company by discounting its projected economic profit at the cost of capital and adding the starting invested capital. Value Inc. starts with  \$500 of invested capital. Its economic profit in year 1 is\$ 50, which grows at 5 percent. Discounting the growing economic profit at a 10 percent discount rate gives a present value of economic profit of 1,000. Use these amounts to solve for value:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {V a l u e} = \text {S t a r t i n g I n v e s t e d C a p i t a l} + \text {P V (P r o j e c t e d E c o n o m i c P r o f i t)} \\ = \$ 500 + \$ 1,000 \\ = \$ 1, 5 0 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

The value of Value Inc. using the economic-profit approach is 1,500, exactly the same as with the discounted-cash-flow (DCF) approach.

Economic profit is also useful for comparing the value creation of different companies or business units. Consider Value Inc.'s economic profit of  \$50. Suppose Big Inc. had\$ 5,000 in invested capital but earned only a 15 percent return on capital (and assume it doesn't have investment opportunities with higher returns on capital). Its economic profit would be  \$250. Clearly, creating\$ 250 of economic profit is preferable to creating 50.

Finally, measuring performance in terms of economic profit encourages a company to undertake investments that earn more than their cost of capital, even if their return is lower than the current average return. Suppose Value Inc. had the opportunity to invest an extra  \$200 at a 15 percent return. Its average ROIC would decline from 20 percent to 18.6 percent, but its economic profit would increase from\$ 50 to 60.

# CONSERVATION OF VALUE

A corollary of the principle that discounted cash flow (DCF) drives value is the conservation of value: anything that doesn't increase cash flows doesn't create value. That means value is conserved, or unchanged, when a company changes the ownership of claims to its cash flows but doesn't change the total available cash flows—for example, when it substitutes debt for equity or issues debt to repurchase shares. Similarly, changing the appearance of the cash flows without actually changing the cash flows—say, by changing accounting techniques—doesn't change the value of a company.[10] While the validity of this principle is obvious, it is worth emphasizing because executives, investors, and pundits so often forget it, as when they hope that one accounting treatment will lead to a higher value than another or that some fancy financial structure will turn a mediocre deal into a winner.

The battle over how companies should account for executive stock options illustrates the extent to which executives continue to believe (erroneously) that the stock market is unaware of the conservation of value. Even though there is no cash effect when executive stock options are issued, they reduce the cash flow available to existing shareholders by diluting their ownership when the options are exercised. Under accounting rules dating back to the 1970s, companies could exclude the implicit cost of executive stock options from their income statements. In the early 1990s, as options became more material, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) proposed a change to the accounting rules, requiring companies to record an expense for the value of options when they are issued. A large group of executives and venture capitalists thought investors would be spooked if options were brought onto the income statement. Some claimed that the entire venture capital industry would be decimated because young start-up companies that provide much of their compensation through options would show low or negative profits.

The FASB issued its new rules in 2004,[11] more than a decade after taking up the issue and only after the bursting of the dot-com bubble. Despite dire predictions, the stock prices of companies didn't change when the new accounting rules were implemented, because the market already reflected the cost of the options in its valuations of companies.[12] One respected analyst told us, "I don't care whether they are recorded as an expense or simply disclosed in the footnotes. I know what to do with the information."

In this case, the conservation of value principle explains why executives didn't need to worry about any effects that changes in stock option accounting would have on their share price. The same applies to questions such as whether an acquisition creates value simply because reported earnings increase, whether a company should return cash to shareholders through share repurchases instead of dividends, or whether financial engineering creates value. In every circumstance, executives should focus on increasing cash flows rather than finding gimmicks that merely redistribute value among investors or make reported results look better. Executives should also be wary of proposals that claim to create value unless they're clear about how their actions will materially increase the size of the pie. If you can't pinpoint the tangible source of value creation, you're probably looking at an illusion, and you can be sure that's what the market will think, too.

# Conserving Value: A Brief History

The value conservation principle is described in the seminal textbook *Principles of Corporate Finance*, by Richard Brealey, Stewart Myers, and Franklin Allen.[13] One of the earliest applications of the principle can be found in the pioneering work of Nobel Prize winners Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller, financial economists who in the late 1950s and early 1960s questioned whether managers could use changes in capital structure to increase share prices. In 1958, they showed that the value of a company shouldn't be affected by changing the structure of the debt and equity ownership unless the overall cash flows generated by the company also change.[14]

Imagine a company that has no debt and generates  \$100 of cash flow each year before paying shareholders. Suppose the company is valued at\$ 1,000. Now suppose the company borrows \$200 and pays it out to the shareholders. Our knowledge of the core valuation principle and the value conservation principle tells us that the company would still be worth \$1,000, with \$200 for the creditors and \$800 for the shareholders, because its cash flow available to pay the shareholders and creditors is still 100.

In most countries, however, borrowing money does change cash flows because interest payments are tax deductible. The total taxes paid by the company are lower, thereby increasing the cash flow available to pay both shareholders and creditors. In addition, having debt may induce managers to be more diligent (because they must have cash available to repay the debt on time) and, therefore, increase the company's cash flow. On the downside, having debt could make it more difficult for managers to raise capital for attractive investment opportunities, thereby reducing cash flow. The point is that what matters isn't the substitution of debt for equity in and of itself; it matters only if the substitution changes the company's cash flows through tax reductions or if associated changes in management decisions change cash flows.

In a similar vein, finance academics in the 1960s developed the idea of efficient markets. While the meaning and validity of efficient markets are subjects of continuing debate, especially after the bursting of the dot-com and real estate bubbles, one implication of efficient-market theory remains: the stock market isn't easily fooled when companies undertake actions to increase reported accounting profit without increasing cash flows. One example is the market's reaction to changes in accounting for employee stock options, as described in the previous section of this chapter. And when the FASB eliminated goodwill amortization effective in 2002 and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) did the same in 2005, many companies reported increased profits, but their underlying values and stock prices didn't change, because the accounting change didn't affect cash flows. The evidence is overwhelming that the market isn't fooled by actions that don't affect cash flow, as we will show in Chapter 7.

# A Tool for Managers

The conservation of value principle is so useful because it tells us what to look for when analyzing whether some action will create value: the cash flow impact and nothing else. This principle applies across a wide range of important business decisions, such as accounting policy, acquisitions (Chapter 31), corporate portfolio decisions (Chapter 28), dividend payout policy (Chapter 33), and capital structure (also Chapter 33).

This section provides three examples where applying the conservation of value principle can be useful: share repurchases, acquisitions, and financial engineering.

Share Repurchases Share repurchases have become a popular way for companies to return cash to investors (see Chapter 33 for more detail). Until the early 1980s, more than 90 percent of the total distributions by large U.S. companies to shareholders were dividends, and less than 10 percent were share repurchases. But since 1998, about 50 percent of total distributions have been share repurchases.[15]

While buying back shares is often a good thing for management to do, a common fallacy is that share repurchases create value simply because they increase earnings per share (EPS).[16] For example, assume that a company with  \$700 of earnings and 1,000 shares outstanding borrows\$ 1,000 to repurchase 10 percent of its shares. For every \$1,000 of shares repurchased, the company will pay, say, 5 percent interest on its new debt. After tax savings of 25 percent, its total earnings would decline by \$37.50, or 5.4\%. However, the number of shares has declined by 10 percent, so earnings per share (EPS) would increase by about 5 percent.

A 5 percent increase in EPS without working very hard sounds like a great deal. Assuming the company's P/E ratio doesn't change, its market value per share also will increase by 5 percent. In other words, you can get something for nothing: higher EPS with a constant P/E.

Unfortunately, this doesn't square with the conservation of value, because the total cash flow of the business has not increased. While EPS has increased by 5 percent, the company's debt has increased as well. With higher leverage, the company's equity cash flows will be more volatile, and investors will demand a higher return. This will bring down the company's  $\mathrm{P / E}$ , offsetting the increase in EPS.

Moreover, you must consider where the company could have invested the cash rather than returning it to shareholders. If the return on capital from the investment exceeded the company's cost of capital, it's likely that the longer-term EPS would be higher from the investment than from the share repurchases. Share repurchases increase EPS immediately, but possibly at the expense of lower long-term earnings.[17]

However, even if cash flow isn't increased by a buyback, some have rightly argued that repurchasing shares can reduce the likelihood that management will invest the cash at low returns. If this is true and it is likely that management would otherwise have invested the money unwisely, then you have a legitimate source of value creation, because the operating cash flows of the company would increase. Said another way, when the likelihood of investing cash at low returns is high, share repurchases make sense as a tactic for avoiding value destruction. But they don't in themselves create value.

Some argue that management should repurchase shares when the company's shares are undervalued. Suppose management believes that the current share price of the company doesn't reflect its underlying potential, so it buys back shares today. One year later, the market price adjusts to reflect management's expectations. Has value been created? Once again, the answer is no, value has not been created; it has only been shifted from one set of shareholders (those who sold) to the shareholders who did not sell. So while the holding shareholders may have benefited, the shareholders as a whole were not affected. Buying back shares when they are undervalued may be good for the shareholders who don't sell, but studies of share repurchases have shown that companies aren't very good at timing share repurchases, often buying when their share prices are high, not low.[18]

Executives as a rule need to exercise caution when presented with transactions like share repurchases that appear to create value by boosting EPS. Always ask, "Where is the source of the value creation?" Some research and development (R&D)-intensive companies, for example, have searched for ways to capitalize R&D spending through complex joint ventures, hoping to lower expenses that reduce EPS. But does the joint venture create value by increasing short-term EPS? No, and in fact it may destroy value because the company now transfers upside potential—and risk, of course—to its partners.

Acquisitions Chapter 31 covers acquisitions in more detail, but for now we can say that acquisitions create value only when the combined cash flows of the two companies increase due to cost reductions, accelerated revenue growth, or better use of fixed and working capital.

To give you a sense of how a good transaction might work, we'll use the example of United Rentals' purchase of RSC (another equipment rental company) for  \$1.9 billion in 2011. Within several years, they had achieved more than\$ 250 million of annual cost savings. We conservatively estimated that the cost savings were worth over 1.5 billion in present value. That's equivalent to about 80 percent of the purchase price.

A revenue acceleration example comes from Johnson & Johnson, which in 1994 acquired Neutrogena, a maker of skin-care products, for  \$924 million. Over the next eight years, management introduced 20 new products within existing product categories and launched an entire line of men's care products. It also accelerated the brand's presence outside the United States. As a result, J&J increased Neutrogena's sales from\$ 281 million to 778 million by 2002.

18 B. Jiang and T. Koller, "The Savvy Executive's Guide to Buying Back Shares," McKinsey on Finance, no. 41 (Autumn 2011): 14-17. The results here are counter to academic studies that were based on earlier samples and included many small companies. Our study included only companies in the S&P 500. When share buybacks were rare, announcements were made with great fanfare and often provided strong signals of management's concern for capital discipline. Most of the fanfare has faded, as companies regularly repurchase shares, so announcements aren't a surprise to the market anymore.

The common element of both these acquisitions was radical performance improvement, not marginal change. But sometimes we have seen acquisitions justified by what could only be called magic.

Assume, for example, that Company A is worth  \$100 and Company B is worth\$ 50, based on their respective expected cash flows. Company A buys Company B for 50, issuing its own shares. For simplicity, assume that the combined cash flows are not expected to increase. What is the new Company AB worth?

Immediately after the acquisition, the two companies are the same as they were before, with the same expected cash flows, and the original shareholders of the two companies still own the shares of the combined company. So Company AB should be worth  \$150, and the original A shareholders' shares of AB should be worth\$ 100, while the original B shareholders' shares of AB should be worth 50.

As simple as this seems, some executives and financial professionals will still see some extra value in the transaction. Assume that Company A is expected to earn  \$5 next year, so its P/E is 20 times. Company B is expected to earn\$ 3 next year, so its P/E is 16.7 times. What then will be the P/E of Company AB? A straightforward approach suggests that the value of Company AB should remain \$150. Its earnings will be \$8, so its P/E will be about 18.8, between A's and B's P/Es. But here's where the magic happens. Many executives and bankers believe that once A buys B, the stock market will apply A's P/E of 20 to B's earnings. In other words, B's earnings are worth more once they are owned by A. By this thinking, the value of Company AB would be $160, a $10 increase in the combined value.

There are even terms for this: multiple expansion in the United States and rerating in the United Kingdom. The notion is that the multiple of Company B's earnings expands to the level of Company A's because the market doesn't recognize that perhaps the new earnings added to A are not as valuable. This must be so, because B's earnings will now be all mixed up with A's, and the market won't be able to tell the difference.

Another version of the multiple-expansion illusion works the other way around. Now suppose Company B purchases Company A. We've heard the argument that since a company with a lower price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is buying a higher-P/E company, it must be getting into higher-growth businesses. Higher growth is generally good, so another theory postulates that because B is accelerating its growth, its P/E will increase.

If multiple expansion were true, all acquisitions would create value because the P/E on the lower-P/E company's earnings would rise to that of the company with the higher P/E, regardless of which was the buyer or seller. But no data exist that support this fallacy. Multiple expansion may sound great, but it is an entirely unsound way of justifying an acquisition that doesn't have tangible benefits.

Every corporate leader must know this. So why are we discussing such obvious fallacies? The answer is that companies often do justify acquisitions using this flawed logic. Our alternative approach is simple: if you can't point to specific sources of increased cash flow, the stock market won't be fooled.

Financial Engineering Another area where the value conservation principle is important is financial engineering, which unfortunately has no standard definition. For our purposes, we define financial engineering as the use of financial instruments or structures other than straight debt and equity to manage a company's capital structure and risk profile.

Financial engineering can include the use of derivatives, structured debt, securitization, and off-balance-sheet financing. While some of these activities can create real value, most don't. Even so, the motivation to engage in non-value-added financial engineering remains strong because of its short-term, illusory impact.

Consider that many of the largest hotel companies in the United States don't own most of the hotels they operate. Instead, the hotels themselves are owned by other companies, often structured as partnerships or real estate investment trusts (REITs). Unlike corporations, partnerships and REITs don't pay U.S. income taxes; only their owners do. Therefore, an entire layer of taxation is eliminated by placing hotels in partnerships and REITs in the United States. This method of separating ownership and operations lowers total income taxes paid to the government, so investors in the ownership and operating companies are better off as a group, because their aggregate cash flows are higher. This is an example of financial engineering that adds real value by increasing cash flows.

In contrast, sale-leaseback transactions rarely create value for investment-grade companies.[19] In a sale-leaseback transaction, a company sells an asset that it owns but wants to continue to use, such as an office building, to a buyer who then leases it back to the company. Often, the company structures the lease so that it is treated as a sale for accounting purposes, and then removes the asset from the company's balance sheet. It can also use the sale proceeds to pay down debt. Now it appears that the company has fewer assets and less debt. Rental expense replaces future depreciation and interest expense (though rental expense is typically higher than the sum of depreciation and interest expense).

For larger investment-grade companies, the implied interest rate on the lease is often higher than the company's regular borrowing rate, because the lessor uses the creditworthiness of the lessee to finance its purchase. In addition, the company buying the asset must cover its cost of equity and its operating costs.

If the company intends to use the asset for its remaining life (by renewing the lease as it expires), then it has created no value, even though the company appears to be less capital-intensive and to have lower debt. In fact, it has destroyed value because the cost of the lease is higher than the cost of borrowing. The company also incurs its own transaction costs and may have to pay taxes on any gain from the sale of the asset. What's more, other creditors and rating agencies will often treat the lease as a debt equivalent anyway.

The transaction may create value if the company wants the ability to stop using the asset before its remaining life expires and wants to eliminate the risk that the value of the asset will be lower when it decides to stop using the asset.

Sale-leaseback transactions may also create value if the lessor is better able to use the tax benefits associated with owning the asset, such as accelerated depreciation. This does not violate the conservation of value principle, because the total cash flows to the companies involved have increased—at the expense of the government.

# THE MATH OF VALUE CREATION

Earlier in this chapter, we introduced the value driver formula, a simple equation that captures the essence of valuation. For readers interested in the technical math of valuation, this section will show how we derive the formula. Let's begin with some terminology that we will use throughout the book (Part Two defines the terms in detail):

- Net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) represents the profits generated from the company's core operations after subtracting the income taxes related to those core operations.
- Invested capital represents the cumulative amount the business has invested in its core operations—primarily property, plant, and equipment and working capital.
- Net investment is the increase in invested capital from one year to the next:  $\mathrm{Net~Investment} = \mathrm{Invested~Capital}_{t + 1} - \mathrm{Invested~Capital}_t$
- Free cash flow (FCF) is the cash flow generated by the core operations of the business after deducting investments in new capital:

$\mathrm{FCF} = \mathrm{NOPAT} - \mathrm{Net~Investment}$

- Return on invested capital (ROIC) is the return the company earns on each dollar invested in the business:

$$
\mathrm {R O I C} = \frac {\mathrm {N O P A T}}{\text {I n v e s t e d C a p i t a l}}
$$

ROIC can be defined in two ways: as the return on all capital or as the return on new, or incremental, capital. For now, we assume that both returns are the same.

- Investment rate (IR) is the portion of NOPAT invested back into the business:

$$
\mathrm {I R} = \frac {\text {N e t I n v e s t m e n t}}{\text {N O P A T}}
$$
- Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate of return that investors expect to earn from investing in the company and therefore the appropriate discount rate for the free cash flow. WACC is defined in detail in Chapter 15.
- Growth  $(g)$  is the rate at which the company's NOPAT and cash flow grow each year.

Assume that the company's revenues and NOPAT grow at a constant rate and the company invests the same proportion of its NOPAT in its business each year. Investing the same proportion of NOPAT each year also means that the company's free cash flow will grow at a constant rate.

Since the company's cash flows are growing at a constant rate, we can begin by valuing a company using the well-known cash-flow perpetuity formula:

$$
\mathrm {V a l u e} = \frac {\mathrm {F C F} _ {t = 1}}{\mathrm {W A C C} - g}
$$

This formula is well established in the finance and mathematics literature.[20]

Next, define free cash flow in terms of NOPAT and the investment rate:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {F C F} = \mathrm {N O P A T} - \mathrm {N e t} \\ = \mathrm {N O P A T} - (\mathrm {N O P A T} \times \mathrm {I R}) \\ = \mathrm {N O P A T} (1 - \mathrm {I R}) \\ \end{array}
$$

Earlier, we developed the relationship between the investment rate (IR), the company's projected growth in NOPAT  $(g)$ , and the return on investment (ROIC):21

$$ g = \mathrm {R O I C} \times \mathrm {I R}
$$

Solving for IR, rather than  $g$ , leads to:

$$
\mathrm {I R} = \frac {g}{\text {R O I C}}
$$

Now build this into the definition of free cash flow:

$$
\mathrm {F C F} = \mathrm {N O P A T} \left(1 - \frac {g}{\mathrm {R O I C}}\right)
$$

Substituting for free cash flow in the cash-flow perpetuity formula gives the key value driver formula:[22]

$$
\mathrm {V a l u e} = \frac {\mathrm {N O P A T} _ {t = 1} \left(1 - \frac {g}{\mathrm {R O I C}}\right)}{\mathrm {W A C C} - g}
$$

This formula underpins the discounted-cash-flow (DCF) approach to valuation, and a variant of the equation lies behind the economic-profit approach. Chapter 10 describes in depth these two mathematically equivalent valuation techniques. You might go so far as to say that this formula represents all there is to valuation. Everything else is mere detail.

Substituting the forecast assumptions given for Value Inc. and Volume Inc. in Exhibit 3.2 into the key value driver formula results in the same values we came up with when we discounted their cash flows:

<table><tr><td>Company</td><td>NOPATt=1, $</td><td>Growth, \%</td><td>ROIC, \%</td><td>WACC, \%</td><td>Value, $</td></tr><tr><td>Value Inc.</td><td>100</td><td>5</td><td>20</td><td>10</td><td>1,500</td></tr><tr><td>Volume Inc.</td><td>100</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>1,000</td></tr></table>

In most cases, we do not use this formula in practice. The reason is that in most situations, the model is overly restrictive, as it assumes a constant ROIC and growth rate going forward. For companies whose key value drivers are expected to change, we need a model that is more flexible in its forecasts. Nevertheless, while we do not use this formula in practice, it is extremely useful as a means to maintain focus on what drives value.

Until now, we have concentrated on how ROIC and growth drive the DCF valuation. It is also possible to use the key value driver formula to show that ROIC and growth determine the multiples commonly used to analyze company valuation, such as price-to-earnings and market-to-book ratios. To see this, divide both sides of the key value driver formula by NOPAT:

$$
\frac {\mathrm {V a l u e}}{\mathrm {N O P A T} _ {t = 1}} = \frac {\left(1 - \frac {g}{\mathrm {R O I C}}\right)}{\mathrm {W A C C} - g}
$$

As the formula shows, a company's earnings multiple is driven by both its expected growth and its return on invested capital.

You can also turn the formula into a value-to-invested-capital formula. Start with the identity:

$$
\mathrm {N O P A T} = \text {I n v e s t e d C a p i t a l} \times \mathrm {R O I C}
$$

Substitute this definition of NOPAT into the key value driver formula:

$$
\text {V a l u e} = \frac {\text {I n v e s t e d C a p i t a l} \times \text {R O I C} \times \left(1 - \frac {g}{\text {R O I C}}\right)}{\text {W A C C} - g}
$$

Divide both sides by invested capital:[23]

$$
\frac {\text {V a l u e}}{\text {I n v e s t e d C a p i t a l}} = \text {R O I C} \left(\frac {1 - \frac {g}{\text {R O I C}}}{\text {W A C C} - g}\right)
$$

Now that we have explained the logic behind the DCF approach to valuation, you may wonder why analysts' reports and investment-banking pitches so often use earnings multiples, rather than valuations based on DCF analysis. The answer is partly that earnings multiples are a useful shorthand for communicating values to a wider public. A leading sell-side analyst told us that he uses discounted cash flow to analyze and value companies but typically communicates his findings in terms of implied multiples. For example, an analyst might say Company X deserves a higher multiple than Company Y because it is expected to grow faster, earn higher margins, or generate more cash flow. Earnings multiples are also a useful sanity check for your valuation. In practice, we always compare a company's implied multiple based on our valuation with those of its peers to see if we can explain why its multiple is higher or lower in terms of its ROIC or growth rates. See Chapter 18 for a discussion of how to analyze earnings multiples.

23 If total ROIC and incremental ROIC are not the same, then this equation becomes:

$$
\frac {\text {V a l u e}}{\text {I n v e s t e d C a p i t a l}} = \text {R O I C} \left(\frac {1 - \frac {g}{\text {R O N I C}}}{\text {W A C C} - g}\right)
$$ where ROIC equals the return on the company's current capital and RONIC equals the return on new invested capital.


# SUMMARY

This chapter has explored how expected cash flows, discounted at a cost of capital, drive value. Cash flow, in turn, is driven by expected returns on invested capital and revenue growth. Companies create value only when ROIC exceeds their cost of capital. Further, higher-ROIC companies should typically prioritize growth over further improving ROIC, as growth is a more powerful value driver for them. In contrast, lower-ROIC companies should prioritize improving ROIC, as it is a stronger value driver for them.

A corollary of this is the conservation of value: anything that doesn't increase cash flows doesn't create value. So changing the appearance of a company's performance through, say, accounting changes or write-ups or write-downs, without changing cash flows, won't change a company's value. Risk enters into valuation both through the company's cost of capital and in the uncertainty of future cash flows. Because investors can diversify their portfolios, the only risk that affects the cost of capital is the risk that investors cannot diversify, a topic we take up in Chapters 4 and 15.
