# Risk and the Cost of Capital

In valuing companies or projects, the subjects of risk and the cost of capital are essential, inseparable, and fraught with misconceptions. These misconceptions can lead to damaging strategic mistakes. For example, when a company borrows money to finance an acquisition and applies only the cost of debt to the target's cash flows, it might easily overestimate by two times the target's value. Conversely, when a company adds an arbitrary risk premium to a target's cost of capital in an emerging market, it could underestimate the value of the target by half.

A company's cost of capital is critical for determining value creation and for evaluating strategic decisions. It is the rate at which you discount future cash flows for a company or project. It is also the rate you compare with the return on invested capital to determine if the company is creating value. The cost of capital incorporates both the time value of money and the risk of investment in a company, business unit, or project.

In this chapter, we'll explain why the cost of capital is not a cash cost, but an opportunity cost. The opportunity cost is based on what investors could earn by investing their money elsewhere at the same level of risk. This is always an option for publicly listed companies. Only certain types of risks—those that cannot be diversified—cause a company's cost of capital. Other risks, which can be diversified, should only be reflected in the cash flow forecast using multiple cash flow scenarios.

We'll also discuss how much cash flow risk to take on. Companies should take on all investments that have a positive expected value, regardless of their risk profile, unless the projects are so large that failure would threaten the viability of the entire company. Most executives are reluctant to take on smaller risky projects even if the returns are very high. By aggregating projects into portfolios, rather than assessing them individually, executives can often overcome excessive loss aversion.

Our focus in this chapter will be on key principles. Chapter 15 provides detail on how to measure the cost of capital.

# COST OF CAPITAL IS AN OPPORTUNITY COST

The cost of capital is not a cash cost. It is an opportunity cost. To illustrate, when one company acquires another company, the alternative might have been to return that cash to shareholders, who could then reinvest it in other companies. So the cost of capital for the acquiring company is the price investors charge for bearing risk—what they could have earned by reinvesting the proceeds in other investments with similar risk. Similarly, when valuing individual business units or projects for strategic decision making, the correct cost of capital is what a company's investors could expect to earn in other similarly risky projects, not necessarily the whole company. The core principle is that the cost of capital is driven by investors' opportunity cost, because the executives leading the company are the investors' agents and have a fiduciary responsibility to the company's investors. That's why the cost of capital is also referred to as the investors' required return or expected return. The meaning of these terms may differ in academia, but for the most part you can use cost of capital, required return, and expected return interchangeably.

Chapter 15 describes in detail how to estimate a company's opportunity cost of capital. Most practitioners use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC), meaning the weighted average of the cost of equity capital and the cost of debt capital. For now, it's enough to say that a company's cost of equity capital is what investors could earn by investing in a broad portfolio of

3 To be more precise, the cost of capital is the return investors can earn from investing in a well-diversified, "efficient" portfolio of investments with similar risk.

In some countries, executives also have a duty to the "company," but that concept is typically vaguely defined and does not provide executives with much guidance. For the most part, even in those countries, the opportunity cost for investors is the best calculation to make. In the United States, a recent innovation is the "benefit" corporation, whose charter includes additional objectives that executives can weigh against the interest of shareholders, including positive impact on society, workers, communities, and the environment. The concept is relatively new; not many large listed companies are benefit corporations, the conversion to which requires a shareholder vote.

5 The use of WACC is a practical solution. In theory, the opportunity cost of capital is independent of capital structure (a company's amount of debt versus equity) except for the tax benefit of debt. An alternative is to estimate the opportunity cost of capital as the company's cost of equity (what equity investors expect to earn) if it had no debt, adjusted directly for the tax benefit of debt. In theory, the two approaches should yield the same result.

companies (say, the S&P 500), adjusted for the riskiness of the company relative to the average of all companies.

Within a company, individual business units can have different costs of capital if their risk profiles differ. The company's overall cost of capital is simply a weighted average of its business units' costs of capital. In banking, for example, risky trading operations carry much higher costs of capital than more stable retail banking units.

Executives often fail to adequately incorporate the idea of opportunity cost in thinking about their cost of capital. Sometimes they mix up the opportunity cost of capital by associating different funding streams with different investments. For example, when one company acquires another, the buyer might raise enough debt to pay for the entire company. It is tempting to say that the cost of capital for the acquisition is the cost of the debt. But this would be a mistake, because the risk of the target's free cash flows does not equal the risk of the bondholders' cash flows.

To illustrate, say Company A is considering buying Company B. Both operate in the same product area with similar risk. Company A has no debt and an opportunity cost of capital of 8 percent. Suppose Company A can borrow at 4 percent after taxes. For a target company growing at 3 percent with  \$1 billion in earnings and a 15 percent return on capital, the value of the target would be\$ 80 billion at a 4 percent cost of capital and 20 billion at an 8 percent cost of capital. To get a sense of how absurd it would be to use the 4 percent cost of capital, consider that the implied price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) at 4 percent is 80, compared with 20 at an 8 percent cost of capital. Companies growing at 3 percent don't trade at a P/E of 80.

In addition, if you apply the cost of debt to the acquisition, you end up with a perverse situation: Company A's existing businesses are assigned an 8 percent cost of capital, and the acquired business is assigned a 4 percent cost of capital. In addition, the only reason Company A can borrow 100 percent of the cost of the acquisition is that it has unused debt capacity in its existing businesses. And don't forget, the cost of capital is determined by the acquired company's riskiness, not that of the parent company (although their risk profiles are likely to be the same if they are in the same industry).

# COMPANIES HAVE LITTLE CONTROL OVER THEIR COST OF CAPITAL

It might be surprising to learn that the cost of capital for a company with steady revenues, like Procter & Gamble, isn't that different from a company like LyondellBasell, a chemical company in an industry known for having more variable earnings and cash flows. In 2019, most large companies' WACC fell in the range of 7 to 9 percent. The range is small because investors purposely avoid putting all their eggs in one basket. The ability of investors to diversify their portfolios means that only nondiversifiable risk affects the cost

EXHIBIT 4.1 Volatility of Portfolio Return Declines with Diversification of capital. Furthermore, because nondiversifiable risk also generally affects all companies in the same industry in the same way, a company's industry is what primarily drives its cost of capital. Companies in the same industry will have similar costs of capital.

Stock market investors, especially institutional investors, may hold hundreds of different stocks in their portfolios. Even the most concentrated investors have at least 50. As a result, their exposure to any single company is limited. It is possible to show how the total risk of a portfolio of stocks declines as more shares are added to the portfolio (Exhibit 4.1). The risk declines because companies' cash flows are not perfectly correlated. Over any period of time, some will increase while others decline.

One of the durable tenets of academic finance concerns the effect of diversification on the cost of capital. If diversification reduces risk to investors and it is not costly to diversify, then investors will not demand a higher return for any risks that can be eliminated through diversification. They require compensation only for risks they cannot diversify away.

The risks they cannot diversify away are those that affect all companies—for example, exposure to economic cycles. However, since most of the risks that companies face are, in fact, diversifiable, most risks don't affect a company's cost of capital. One way to see this in practice is to note the relatively narrow range of P/Es for large companies. Most large companies have P/Es between 12 and 20. If the cost of capital varied from 5 to 15 percent instead of 7 to 9 percent, many more companies would have P/Es below 8 and above 25.

Whether a company's cost of capital is 7 percent or 9 percent or somewhere in between is a question of great dispute (as we explore in Chapter 15). For decades, the standard model for measuring differences in costs of capital has been the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The CAPM has been challenged by academics and practitioners, but so far, no practical competing model has emerged. $^{6}$  At any rate, when returns on capital across companies vary from less than 5 percent to more than 30 percent (sometimes even within the same sector), a one-percentage-point difference in the cost of capital seems hardly worth arguing about.

The unique risks that any company faces—say, product obsolescence and new competition—are not priced into the cost of capital. That does not mean a company's value is immune to these risks; they do affect expected cash flows and therefore expected value. Companies certainly do need to worry about the effects of such risks, as we discuss later in this chapter.

It is a common misconception that the cost of capital is company-specific, rather than a function of the industries in which a company operates and the specific investments it makes. For the most part, companies have scant influence over the cost of capital of their individual business units or their company as a whole. There are some theoretical examples of how companies could reduce their cost of capital. For example, a company could outsource production to lower fixed costs and therefore reduce the volatility of cash flows. If you can achieve lower volatility than your peers', your cost of capital will be slightly lower. But it's unlikely that the change in the cost of capital will be large enough relative to other strategic considerations of outsourcing manufacturing. Some companies have shortened the duration of their debt to try to reduce their cost of capital. What these companies fail to recognize is that this increases their risk because of the possibility that interest rates will be higher when the shorter-term debt is rolled over or that the company may have difficulty refinancing the debt at all.

# CREATE BETTER FORECASTS, NOT AD HOC RISK PREMIUMS

Certain projects carry what many investors see as high risk. These include large capital projects in politically unstable countries (common among companies in the mining and oil and gas sectors), speculative R&D projects in

6 Many in the academic community use the Fama-French three-factor model, but mostly for capital market research rather than business valuation. With this model, a stock's excess returns are regressed on excess market returns (like the CAPM), the excess returns of small stocks minus big stocks (SMB), and the excess returns of high book-to-market stocks minus low book-to-market stocks (HML). In 2015, the authors expanded the model to five factors, adding operating profitability and investment. See E. Fama and K. French, "The Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns," Journal of Finance (June 1992): 427-465; E. Fama and K. French, "Common Risk Factors in the Returns on Stocks and Bonds," Journal of Financial Economics 33 (1993): 3-56; and E. Fama and K. French, "A Five-Factor Asset Pricing Model," Journal of Financial Economics 116 (2015): 1-22.

high tech and pharmaceuticals, and acquisitions of unproven technologies or businesses in a wide range of industries. The potential returns for such investments are alluring, but what if the projects or companies fail? The answer is not to ignore these risks, but to explicitly include them in cash flow forecasts, not the cost of capital. The preferred way is to develop multiple cash flow scenarios.

It's not unusual for companies to bump up the assumed cost of capital to reflect the uncertainty of risky projects. In doing so, however, they often unwittingly set these rates at levels that even substantial underlying risks would not justify—and end up rejecting good investment opportunities as a result.[8] What many don't realize is that assumptions of discount rates that are only three to five percentage points higher than the cost of capital can significantly reduce estimates of expected value. Adding just three percentage points to an 8 percent cost of capital for an acquisition, for example, can reduce its present value by 30 to 40 percent.

Moreover, increasing the discount rate embeds into the valuation process opaque risk assumptions that are often based on little more than a gut sense that the risk is higher. The problem arises because companies take shortcuts when they estimate cash flows. To calculate expected value, project analysts should discount the expected cash flows at an appropriate cost of capital. In many cases, though, they use only estimates of cash flow that assume everything goes well. Managers, realizing this, increase the discount rate to compensate for the possibility that cash flows are overstated.

A better approach for determining the expected value of a project is to develop multiple cash flow scenarios, value them at the unadjusted cost of capital, and then apply probabilities for the value of each scenario to estimate the expected value of the project or company. Exhibit 4.2 provides an example. For simplicity, we assume just two scenarios, one with a present value of  \$1,000 and the other with a present value of\$ 1,667, based on each scenario's expected cash flow. Assuming a 50 percent probability for each scenario leads to an expected value of 1,333.

EXHIBIT 4.2 Scenario Approach to Incorporating Nondiversifiable Risk

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Expected net present value (NPV), $</td><td rowspan="2">Probability of scenario</td><td rowspan="2">NPV at 8\% WACC, $</td><td colspan="4">Cash flows, $</td></tr><tr><td>Year 1</td><td>Year 2</td><td>Year 3</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">1,333</td><td>Base case:50\%</td><td>1,667</td><td>100</td><td>102</td><td>104</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Downside case:50\%</td><td>1,000</td><td>60</td><td>61</td><td>62</td><td></td></tr></table>

Using scenarios has several advantages:

- It provides decision makers with more information. Rather than looking at a project with a single-point estimate of expected value (say,  \$100 million), decision makers know that there is a 20 percent chance that the project's value is\$ 20 million and an 80 percent chance it is 120 million. Making implicit risk assumptions explicit encourages dialogue about the risk of the project.
- It encourages managers to develop strategies to mitigate specific risks, because it explicitly highlights the impact of failure or less than complete success. For example, executives might build more flexibility into a project by providing options for stepwise investments—scaling up in case of success and scaling down in case of failure. Creating such options can significantly increase the value of projects.
- It acknowledges the full range of possible outcomes. When project advocates submit a single scenario, they need it to reflect enough upside to secure approval but also be realistic enough that they can commit to its performance targets. These requirements often produce a poor compromise. If advocates present multiple scenarios, they can show a project's full upside potential and realistic project targets they can truly commit to while also fully disclosing a project's potential downside risk.

Managers applying the scenario approach should be wary of overly simplistic assumptions—say, a 10 percent increase or decrease to the cash flows. A good scenario analysis will often lead to a highly successful case that is many multiples of the typical base case. It will often also include a scenario with a negative value. In addition, there may not be a traditional base case. For many projects, there is only big success or failure, with low likelihood that a project will just barely earn more than the cost of capital.

Consider an extreme example. Project A requires an up-front investment of  \$2,000. If everything goes well with the project, the company earns\$ 1,000 per year forever. If not, the company gets zero. (Such all-or-nothing projects are not unusual.) To value project A, finance theory directs you to discount the expected cash flow at the cost of capital. But what is the expected cash flow in this case? If there is a 60 percent chance of everything going well, the expected cash flows would be \$600 per year. At a 10 percent cost of capital, the project would be worth \$6,000 once completed. Subtracting the \$2,000 investment, the net value of the project before the investment is made is \$4,000.

But the project will never generate \$600 per year. It will generate annual cash flows of either \$1,000 or zero. That means the present value of the discounted cash flows will be either \$10,000 or nothing, making the project net of the initial investment worth either \$8,000 or -\$2,000. The probability of it being worth the expected value of \$4,000 (that is, 6,000 less the investment) is zero. Rather than trying to identify the expected value, managers would be better off knowing that the project carries a 60 percent chance of being worth  \$8,000 and a 40 percent risk of losing\$ 2,000. Managers can then examine the scenarios under which each outcome prevails and decide whether the upside compensates for the downside, whether the company can comfortably absorb the potential loss, and whether they can take actions to reduce the magnitude or risk of loss. The theoretical approach of focusing on expected values, while mathematically correct, hides some important information about the range and exclusivity of particular outcomes.

Moreover, some companies don't apply the expected-value approach correctly. Few companies discuss multiple scenarios, preferring a single-point forecast on which to base a yes-or-no decision. Most companies would simply represent the expected cash flows from this project as being  \$1,000 per year, the amount if everything goes well, and allow for uncertainty in the cash flow by arbitrarily increasing the discount rate. While you can get to the right answer with this approach, it has two flaws. First, there is no easy way to determine the cost of capital that gives the correct value. In this case, using a 16.7 percent cost of capital instead of 10 percent results in a project value of\$ 6,000 before the investment and \$4,000 after the investment. But the only way to know that this is the correct value would be to conduct a thorough scenario analysis. Companies sometimes arbitrarily add a risk premium to the cost of capital, but there is no way for them to know whether the amount they add is even reasonably accurate. Second, the decision makers evaluating a project with cash flows of \$1,000 per year and a 16.7 percent cost of capital are still not thinking through the 40 percent risk that it might generate no cash at all.

If for some reason you must use a single cash flow scenario, you can analytically estimate the equivalent risk premium for different probability levels of failure, as in Exhibit 4.3. The exhibit shows the amounts by which you would increase the cost of capital instead of using cash flow scenarios for different combinations of the probability of failure, as represented on the vertical axis, and the size of loss relative to the base case, as represented by the horizontal axis. For example, if there was a 50 percent chance of failure in which case the project would be worth 40 percent less than expected, the equivalent risk premium would be 1.5 percent. Notice in this exhibit that the risk premiums are small relative to what most people expect. To get close to a 3 percent risk premium, for example, you'd have to believe there was a 50 percent chance of failure and a 60 percent reduction in cash flows associated with failure. To get to a 5 percent risk premium, you'd have to believe there is a 50 percent chance of failure and more than an 80 percent reduction in cash flows.[9]

Adding ad hoc risk premiums is a crude way to include project-specific uncertainty in a valuation. Scenario-based approaches have the dual appeal of better answers and more transparency on the assumptions embedded within them.

# DECIDE HOW MANY CASH FLOW RISK TO TAKE ON

Now let's turn to cash flow risk. When we talk about total cash flow risk, we mean the uncertainty that a company faces about its future cash flows, whether for the company as a whole, a business unit, or a single project. Finance theory provides guidance on pricing the nondiversifiable part of cash flow risk in the cost of capital. In theory, a company should take on all projects or growth opportunities that have positive expected values even if there is high likelihood of failure, as long as the project is small enough that failure will not put the company in financial distress. In practice, we've found that companies overweight the impact of losses from smaller projects, thereby missing value creation opportunities.

For instance, how should a company think through whether to undertake a project—let's call it project A—with a 60 percent chance of earning  \$8,000, a 40 percent chance of losing\$ 2,000, and an expected value of 4,000? Theory says to take on all projects with a positive expected value, regardless of the upside-versus-downside risk. A company is likely to have many small projects like this example, so for small projects, it should take on all projects with positive expected value, regardless of risk.

But what if the company instead has one large project where the downside possibility would bankrupt the company? Consider an electric power company with the opportunity to build a nuclear power facility for  \$15 billion (a realistic amount for a facility with two reactors). Suppose the company has\$ 25 billion in existing debt and 25 billion in equity market capitalization. If the plant is successfully constructed and brought on line, there is an 80 percent chance it will be worth  \$28 billion, for a net value of\$ 13 billion. But there is a 20 percent chance it will fail to receive regulatory approval and be worth zero, leading to a loss of \$15 billion. The expected value is \$7 billion net of investment.[10] Failure will bankrupt the company, because the cash flow from the company's existing plants would be insufficient to cover its existing debt plus the debt on the failed plant. In this case, the economics of the nuclear plant spill over onto the value of the rest of the company. Failure would wipe out all the equity of the company, not just the 15 billion invested in the plant.

The implication is that a company should not take on a risk that will put the rest of the company in danger. In other words, don't do anything that has large negative spillover effects on the rest of the company. This caveat would be enough to guide managers in the earlier example of deciding whether to go ahead with project A. If a 2,000 loss would endanger the company as a whole, management should forgo the project, despite its 60 percent likelihood of success. But by the same token, companies should not avoid risks that don't threaten their ability to operate normally.

Executives making decisions for their companies should think about the company's risk profile, not their own.[11] After all, that's the job of corporations; they are designed to take risks and overcome the natural loss aversion of individuals. The earliest corporations were the British and Dutch East India shipping companies. With those, if a ship sank, all shareholders would lose a tolerable amount instead of having one ship owner lose his entire fortune.

Professors Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky have demonstrated that most people place greater weight on the potential economic losses from their decisions than on the potential equivalent gains. In a McKinsey survey of 1,500 global executives across many industries,[12] we presented the executives with the following scenario: You are considering making a  \$10 million investment that has some chance of returning, in present value,\$ 40 million over three years, with some chance of losing the entire investment in the first year. What is the highest loss you would tolerate and still proceed with the investment?

A risk-neutral executive would be willing to accept a 75 percent chance of loss and a 25 percent chance of gain. One-quarter of  \$40 million is\$ 10 million, which is the initial investment, so a 25 percent chance of gain creates an expected risk-neutral value of zero. But most survey respondents demonstrated extreme loss aversion; they were willing to accept only a 19 percent chance of loss to make this investment, nowhere near the risk-neutral answer of 75 percent. In fact, only 9 percent of respondents were willing to accept a 40 percent

EXHIBIT 4.4 Aggregating Projects Reduces Risk While Achieving High Expected Returns

Informally, we've asked groups of executives the same question at even lower levels of investment and found similar results. Our findings echo those from Professor Ralph O. Swalm, going back to 1966.[13]

This phenomenon has serious consequences for hierarchical organizations. Executives are just as loss-averse when the bets are small as they are when the gambles are large, even though small gambles do not raise the same issues of survival or ruin that provide a rationale for aversion to large risks. What's more, small gambles offer opportunities for the risk-reducing effects of aggregation.

To overcome loss aversion and make better investment decisions, individuals and organizations must learn to frame choices in the context of the entire company's success, not the individual project's performance. In practice, this means looking at projects as a portfolio by aggregating them, rather than focusing on the risk of individual projects.

One technology company successfully used a portfolio approach to assess its projects. First, executives estimated the expected return of each project proposal (measured as expected present value divided by investment) and the risks associated with each (measured as the standard deviation of projected returns). Executives then built portfolios of projects and identified combinations that would deliver the best balance between return and risk. When they viewed portfolios of projects in the aggregate (Exhibit 4.4), executives could see that portfolios of projects had higher returns than most of the individual projects and much lower risk compared with most of the individual projects.

It's worth pointing out that even though a portfolio of projects has lower risk, the use of portfolios does not lower a company's cost of capital. That's because the portfolio, by definition, cannot reduce the nondiversifiable risk, which is the risk embedded in the cost of capital.

# DECIDE WHICH TYPES OF RISK TO HEDGE

There are also risks that investors are eager for companies to take. For example, investors in gold-mining companies and oil production companies buy those stocks to gain exposure to often-volatile gold or oil prices. If gold and oil companies attempt to hedge their revenues, that effort merely complicates life for their investors, who then must guess how much price risk is being hedged and how and whether management will change its policy in the future. Moreover, hedging may lock in today's prices for two years, the time horizon within which it is possible to hedge those commodities, but a company's present value includes the cash flows from subsequent years at fluctuating market prices. So while hedging may reduce the short-term cash flow volatility, it will have little effect on the company's valuation based on long-term cash flows.

Some risks, like the commodity price risk in this example, can be managed by shareholders themselves. Other, similar-looking risks—for example, some forms of currency risk—are harder for shareholders to manage. The general rule is to avoid hedging the first type of risk but hedge the second if possible.

Consider the effect of U.S. dollar currency risk on Heineken, the global brewer. For the U.S. market, Heineken produces its flagship brand, Heineken, in the Netherlands, and ships it to America. In most other markets, it produces and sells in the same country. So, for most markets, an exchange rate change affects only the translation of local profits into their reporting currency. For example, for most markets, a 1 percent change in the value of the local currency relative to the euro translates into a 1 percent change in revenues and a 1 percent change in profits as well. Note that the effect on revenues and profits is the same, because all the revenues and costs are in the same currency. There is no change in operating margin.

The U.S. market is different. When the dollar/euro exchange rate changes, Heineken's revenues in euros are affected, but its costs are not. If the dollar declines by 1 percent, Heineken's euro revenues also decline by 1 percent. But since its costs are in euros, those don't change. Assuming a 10 percent margin to begin with, a 1 percent decline in the dollar will reduce Heineken's margin to 9 percent, and its profits reported in euros will decline by a whopping 10 percent.

Because Heineken's production facilities are in a different country and it is unable to pass on cost increases because it is competing with locally produced products, its currency risk is larger for its U.S. business than for its other markets. Hedging might be much more important for Heineken's U.S. business than for other markets, because a rise or fall in the dollar/euro exchange rate has a much greater impact on its business.

# SUMMARY

To avoid unfavorable strategic decisions, executives must understand well the dynamic relationship between the cost of capital and risk. Risk enters valuation both through the company's cost of capital (an opportunity cost) and through the uncertainty surrounding future cash flows. Because investors can diversify their portfolios, a company's cost of capital is for the most part determined by the industry in which it operates.

Valuations that use multiple cash flow scenarios better reflect diversifiable risks than those that adjust the cost of capital. Executives tend to shy away from risky projects even if the potential return is high. This excessive loss aversion can be overcome by examining portfolios of projects, rather than individual ones.
