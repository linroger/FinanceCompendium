# The Alchemy of Stock Market Performance

A commonly used measure for evaluating the performance of a company and its management is total shareholder returns (TSR), defined as the percent increase in share price plus the dividend yield over a period of time. In fact, in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that companies publish in their annual reports their TSR relative to a set of peers over the last five years. That sounds like a good idea: if managers focus on improving TSR to win performance bonuses, then their interests and the interests of their shareholders should be aligned. The evidence shows that this is indeed true over long periods—at a minimum, 10 to 15 years. But TSR measured over shorter periods may not reflect the actual performance of a company, because TSR is heavily influenced by changes in investors' expectations, not just the company's performance.

Earning a high TSR is much harder for managers leading an already-successful company than for those leading a company with substantial room for improvement. That's because a company performing above its peers will attract investors expecting more of the same, pushing up the share price. Managers then must pull off herculean feats of real performance improvement to exceed those expectations and outperform on TSR. We call their predicament the "expectations treadmill." For high-performing companies, TSR in isolation can unfairly penalize their high performance. Another drawback is that using TSR by itself, without understanding its components, doesn't help executives or their boards understand how much of the TSR comes from operating performance, nonoperating items, and changes in expectations.

The widespread use of TSR over short periods as a measure of management performance can create perverse incentives. Managers running full tilt on the expectations treadmill may be tempted to pursue ideas that give an immediate bump to their TSR at the expense of longer-term investments that will create more value for shareholders over a longer horizon. In addition, TSR may rise or fall across the board for all companies because of external factors beyond managers' control, such as changing inflation rates. Strictly speaking, such factors should play no part in managers' compensation.

This chapter starts by explaining the expectations treadmill. It then shows an approach to analyzing TSR that isolates how much TSR comes from revenue growth and improvements in return on invested capital (ROIC)—the factors that drive long-term value creation—versus changes in expectations and nonoperating items. Managers, boards of directors, and investors can learn much more about company performance from this granular breakdown of TSR.

# WHY SHAREHOLDER EXPECTATIONS BECOME A TREADMILL

As we described in Chapter 2, the return on capital that a company earns is not the same as the return earned by every shareholder. Suppose a company can invest  \$1,000 in a factory and earn\$ 200 a year, which it pays out in dividends to its shareholders. The first investors in the company pay \$1,000 in total for their shares, and if they hold the shares, they will earn 20 percent per year (\$200 divided by 1,000).

Suppose that after one year, all the investors decide to sell their shares, and they find buyers who pay  \$2,000 for the lot. The buyers will earn only 10 percent per year on their investment (\$ 200 divided by \$2,000). The first investors will earn a 120 percent return (\$200 dividends plus \$1,000 gain on their shares versus their initial investment of \$1,000). The company's return on capital is 20 percent, while one group of investors earns 120 percent, and the other group earns 10 percent. All the investors collectively will earn, on a time-weighted average, the same return as the company. But individual groups of investors will earn very different returns, because they pay different prices for the shares, based on their expectations of future performance.

One way of understanding the effects of this dynamic is through the analogy of a treadmill, the speed of which represents the expectations built into a company's share price. If the company beats expectations, and if the market believes the improvement is sustainable, the company's stock price goes up, in essence capitalizing the future value of this incremental improvement. But it also means that managers must run even faster just to maintain the new stock price, $^2$  let alone improve it further: the speed of the treadmill quickens as performance improves. So a company with low expectations of success among shareholders at the beginning of a period may have an easier time outperforming the stock market simply because low expectations are easier to beat.

The treadmill analogy is useful because it describes the difficulty of continuing to outperform the stock market. At some point, it becomes almost impossible for management to deliver on accelerating expectations without faltering, just as anyone would eventually stumble on a treadmill that keeps moving faster.

Consider the case of Terry Turnaround, a fictional character based on the experience of many CEOs. Terry has just been hired as the CEO of Prospectus, a company with below-average returns on capital and growth relative to competitors. Because of this past performance, the market doesn't expect much, so the value of Prospectus is low relative to competitors. Terry hires a top-notch team and gets to work. After two years, Prospectus is gaining ground on its peers in margins and return on capital, and its market share is rising. Prospectus's stock price rises twice as fast as its peers' because the market wasn't expecting the company's turnaround.

Terry and her team continue their hard work. After two more years, Prospectus has become the industry leader in operating performance, with the highest return on capital. Because of its low starting point, the company's share price has risen at four times the rate of the industry average. Given Prospectus's new trajectory and consistent performance, the market expects continued above-average returns on capital and revenue growth.

As time goes by, Prospectus maintains its high return on capital and leading market share. But two years later, Terry notes with frustration that her company's shares are now doing no better than those of its peers, even though the company has outperformed rivals. At this point, Terry is trapped on the expectations treadmill: she and her team have done such a good job that the expectation of continued high performance is already incorporated into the company's share price. As long as Prospectus delivers results in line with the market's expectations, its share price performance will be no better or worse than average.

This explains why extraordinary managers may deliver only ordinary TSR: even for the extraordinary manager, it can be extremely difficult to keep beating high expectations. It also explains why managers of companies with low performance expectations might easily earn a high TSR, at least for a short time. They can create a higher TSR by delivering performance that raises shareholder expectations to the level of expectations for their peers in the sector.

The danger for companies whose shareholders already have high expectations is that in their quest to achieve above-peer TSR, they may resort to misguided actions, such as pushing for unrealistic earnings growth or pursuing big, risky acquisitions. Consider the electric power boom at the end of the 1990s and in the early 2000s. Deregulation led to high hopes for power-generation companies, so deregulated energy producers were spun off from their regulated parents at extremely high valuations. Mirant, for instance, was spun off from Southern Company in October 2000 with a combined equity and debt capitalization of almost 18 billion, a multiple of about 30 times earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA)—quite extraordinary for a power-generation company. To justify its value, Mirant expanded aggressively, as did similar companies, investing in power plants in the Bahamas, Brazil, Chile, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, and the Philippines, as well as 14 U.S. states. The debt burden from these investments quickly became too much for Mirant to handle, and the company filed for bankruptcy in July 2003. The expectations treadmill pushed Mirant into taking enormous risks to justify its share price, and it paid the ultimate price.

The expectations treadmill is the dynamic behind the adage that a good company and a good investment may not be the same. In the short term, good companies may not be good investments, because future great performance might already be built into the share price. Smart investors may prefer weaker-performing companies, because they have more upside potential, as the expectations expressed in their lower share prices are easier to beat.

# THE TREADMILL'S REAL-WORLD EFFECTS

Tyson Foods and J&J Snack Foods are two U.S. branded-food processors. Tyson is one of the largest in the world, with brands such as Hillshire Farm and Sara Lee. Its revenues in 2017 were  \$40 billion. J&J Snack Foods is smaller, at just over\$ 1 billion of revenues in 2017, with brands such as Icee and Auntie Anne's. Not surprisingly, given its smaller size and more snack-oriented products, J&J grew its revenues faster, at 6 percent per year from 2013 to 2017, while Tyson grew only 3 percent (Exhibit 5.1). J&J also outperformed on ROIC, with after-tax ROIC (before goodwill and intangibles) averaging about 24 percent over the period, compared with Tyson's 19 percent. Yet Tyson's shareholders earned almost twice the TSR: 27 percent versus 14 percent annualized.

EXHIBIT 5.1 Tyson Foods vs. J&J Snack Foods: Growth, Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), and Total Shareholder Returns (TSR)

The expectations treadmill explains the mismatch between TSR and the underlying value created by the two companies. Using the ratio of enterprise value (EV) to net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) as a proxy for market expectations, J&J's EV/NOPAT started the period at 23 times, while Tyson started at 13 times. This means that J&J's treadmill was already running fast, with high expectations already built into the share price. Tyson's EV/NOPAT was below average, reflecting modest performance expectations. The EV/NOPAT for both companies increased during the period—J&J from 23 times to 29 times, and Tyson from 13 times to 17 times.

Another source of the difference in TSR was changes in ROIC, driven primarily by changes in margins. Tyson's adjusted EBITA/revenues increased from 4 percent to 9 percent, while J&J's remained flat at about 12 percent. Similarly, Tyson's ROIC (excluding goodwill) increased from 12 percent to 22 percent, while J&J's declined from 25 percent to 21 percent.[3]

Which company did a better job? You can make arguments for either one: Tyson succeeded in outperforming its expectations, and J&J Snack Foods succeeded in delivering against high expectations. TSR might have been a fair measure of the performance of Tyson's managers, but it would not have reflected what a great job the J&J team did. For TSR to provide deeper insight into a company's true performance, we need a finer-grained look inside this measure.

# DECOMPOSING TSR

We recommend analyzing TSR by decomposing it and quantifying its components in the manner outlined in this section. The effort serves two purposes. First, when managers, boards of directors, and investors understand the sources of TSR, they are better able to evaluate management. For example, it's important to know that J&J's TSR, though lower than Tyson's, reflects strong underlying performance against high expectations. Second, decomposing TSR can help with setting future targets. For example, it may be challenging for Tyson's managers to repeat their high TSR, because that would probably require raising profit margins and earnings multiples much higher.

The traditional approach to analyzing total shareholder returns is mathematically correct, but it does not link TSR to the true underlying sources of value creation. The decomposition we recommend gives managers a clearer understanding of the elements of TSR they can change, those that are beyond their control, and the speed at which their particular expectations treadmill is running. This information helps managers focus on creating lasting value and communicate to investors and other stakeholders how their plans are likely to affect TSR in the short and long terms.

Decomposition of TSR begins with its definition as the percent change in a company's market value plus its dividend yield (for simplicity, we assume the company has no debt and distributes all its excess cash flow as dividends each year):

$$
\mathrm {T S R} = \text {P e r c e n t C h a n g e i n M a r k e t V a l u e} + \text {D i v i d e n d Y i e l d}
$$

The change in market value is the change in net income plus the change in a company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). Adding the dividend yield gives the following equation for TSR:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {T S R} = \text {P e r c e n t C h a n g e i n N e t I n c o m e} + \text {P e r c e n t C h a n g e i n P / E} \\ + \text {D i v i d e n d Y i e l d} \\ \end{array}
$$

This equation expresses what we refer to as the "traditional" approach to analyzing TSR. While technically correct, however, this expression of TSR misses some important factors. For example, a manager might assume that all forms of net-income growth create an equal amount of value. Yet we know from Chapter 3 that different sources of earnings growth may create different amounts of value, because they are associated with different returns on capital and therefore generate different cash flows. For example, growth from acquisitions may reduce future dividend growth because of the large investments required.

EXHIBIT 5.2 TSR Driven by Revenue Growth, Margin, ROIC, and Changes in Expectations

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-30/75ea39cc-041a-437e-9d57-dabed85d38b7/8f17fbdca48e51ca98e96a56775b58b149e885473a5833c5fcf8f4490b4909fa.jpg)

Note: Assumes company has no debt and no share repurchases.

Dividends = Net Income - Investment

A second problem is that this approach assumes that the dividend yield can be increased without affecting future earnings and dividends, as if dividends themselves create value. But dividends are merely a residual. For example, if a company pays a higher dividend today by taking on more debt, that simply means future dividends must be lower because future interest expense and debt repayments will be higher. Similarly, if a company manages to pay a higher dividend by forgoing attractive investment opportunities, then future dividends will suffer, as future cash flows from operations will be lower.

Finally, the traditional expression of TSR fails to account for the impact of financial leverage: two companies that create underlying value equally well could generate very different TSR, simply because of the differences in their debt-to-equity ratios and the resulting differences in the risk to their investors.

To avoid these problems, we can decompose the traditional TSR components into ones that provide better insight into understanding the underlying sources of value creation. Exhibit 5.2 shows this graphically.

The derivation works as follows. Assume a company with no debt pays out all its cash flow as dividends. Start with the traditional definition:

TSR = Percent Change in Net Income + Percent Change in P/E

+ Dividend Yield

The percent increase in earnings can be decomposed into the increase in revenues and the change in profit margin:5

Percent Change in Net Income = Percent Increase in Revenues

+ Impact of Increase in Profit

Margin on Net Income

The dividend yield also can be decomposed:

$$
\text {D i v i d e n d Y i e l d} = \frac {\text {D i v i d e n d s}}{\text {M a r k e t V a l u e}}
$$

In this simplified example, where the company pays out all its cash flow as dividends, dividends will equal net income less investment. Therefore, the dividend yield can be expressed as the earnings yield (net income divided by market value) less the percent of market value invested back into the business:

$$
\text {D i v i d e n d Y i e l d} = \frac {\text {N e t I n c o m e}}{\text {M a r k e t V a l u e}} - \frac {\text {I n v e s t m e n t}}{\text {M a r k e t V a l u e}}
$$

Putting these components together gives the following expression for TSR:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {T S R} = \text {P e r c e n t C h a n g e i n R e v e n u e} - \frac {\text {I n v e s t m e n t}}{\text {M a r k e t V a l u e}} \\ + \text {I m p a c t} \\ + \frac {\text {N e t I n c o m e}}{\text {M a r k e t V a l u e}} + \text {P e r c e n t C h a n g e i n P / E} \\ \end{array}
$$

To summarize, TSR is driven by these five factors:

1. Revenue growth
2. Investment required to achieve that revenue growth
3. Impact of a change in margin on net income growth
4. Starting ratio of net income to market value (which is the inverse of the P/E ratio)
5. Change in P/E ratio

The investment required for growth is a function of growth and ROIC, as described in Chapter 3:

$$
\text {I n v e s t m e n t} = \text {N e t I n c o m e} \times \text {G r o w t h} / \text {R O I C}
$$

EXHIBIT 5.3 Traditional vs. Enhanced TSR Decomposition

The percent of market value invested therefore equals

$$
\begin{array}{l} \frac {\text {I n v e s t m e n t}}{\text {M a r k e t V a l u e}} = \frac {\text {N e t I n c o m e} \times \text {G r o w t h / R O I C}}{\text {M a r k e t V a l u e}} \\ = \frac {\text {N e t I n c o m e}}{\text {M a r k e t V a l u e}} \times \frac {\text {G r o w t h}}{\text {R O I C}} \\ \end{array}
$$

The ratio of net income to market value is just the inverse of the P/E ratio; therefore,

$$
\frac {\text {I n v e s t m e n t}}{\text {M a r k e t V a l u e}} = \frac {1}{\mathrm {P} / \mathrm {E}} \times \text {G r o w t h} / \text {R O I C}
$$

Now we can see how TSR is driven by growth and ROIC, adjusted by the beginning P/E.

Exhibit 5.3 uses the financials of hypothetical Company A to compare the traditional method of TSR decomposition with our enhanced approach. Looking at the two decomposition approaches on the right side of the exhibit, the traditional approach indicates that Company A has a 14.4 percent TSR, based on 7 percent earnings growth, a 3 percent change in the company's P/E (a proxy for changed expectations), and a 4.4 percent dividend yield. The enhanced approach breaks down the TSR of Company A into three of the four parts of our full process of decomposition (for simplicity, in this example, Company A does not increase its margins). This shows that not much of the 14.4 percent TSR reflects the creation of new value. First, the reinvestment required to achieve 7 percent growth in earnings consumed most of the earnings growth itself, leaving TSR arising from performance at only 1.4 percent. Another 3 percent of TSR comes from a change in shareholder expectations (reflected in the P/E multiple increase), rather than performance, and the

EXHIBIT 5.4 Earnings Yield: TSR with Zero Growth

We have found that many people struggle with the earnings yield (zero-growth return) part of this decomposition. Here's a simple example of how this works. Suppose you have two companies, H and L, each with 100 of earnings and zero growth. Since the companies aren't growing, they don't need to invest, so dividends to shareholders would equal earnings. Company H has a P/E of 20, and Company L has a P/E of 15. Exhibit 5.4 shows why the inverse of the P/E, the earnings yield, is the return the companies would earn if they didn't grow and their P/Es didn't change.

In the example, you can see that the TSR of Company H is 5.0 percent, exactly equal to the inverse of the P/E, the earnings yield. Similarly, Company L's TSR of 6.7 percent equals the inverse of its P/E. Note also that Company H, with the higher P/E, has the lower earnings yield (or zero-growth TSR). This demonstrates that companies with higher P/Es must achieve greater growth or improvements in ROIC to outperform the TSR of companies with lower P/Es.

The next example shows the impact of debt financing on the TSR decomposition. Suppose you own a house worth \$500,000 and you've borrowed \$200,000 against the house. If the house increases in value to \$550,000, your equity value would increase from \$300,000 to 350,000. A 10 percent increase in the value of the house leads to a 17 percent return on your equity.

The same concept applies to companies. Consider Company B, which is identical to Company A (our simpler example in Exhibit 5.3) except for its debt financing. As detailed in Exhibit 5.5, the difference in financing means Company B generated a higher TSR of 18 percent. The traditional approach to decomposing TSR suggests that Company B's shareholders benefited from a higher dividend yield and a stronger increase in expectations. However, our more fundamental decomposition of Company B, based on earnings yield (zero-growth TSR) and changed expectations measured by the unlevered P/E

2 Change in P/E multiple for traditional approach vs. change in unlevered P/E multiple in enhanced approach (enterprise value/earnings).

(ratio of enterprise value to earnings), shows that the first three parts of the company's decomposed TSR are in fact identical to those of Company A. The additional 3.6 percent TSR for Company B arises from the higher proportion of debt in its capital, rather than any newly created value. Adjusting for the higher financial risk associated with higher debt shows that Company B did not in fact create more value than Company A—an important fact for investors and the companies' executives.

We can apply this approach to our earlier comparison of Tyson and J&J Snack Foods. Exhibit 5.6 shows the TSR decomposition for the two companies. While Tyson's 27 percent annual TSR for 2013-2017 was higher than J&J's14 percent, J&J outperformed Tyson on the TSR derived from growth: growth, net of investments, contributed 3 percent to TSR, versus a negative amount for Tyson, which made significant acquisitions that outweighed its modest revenue growth.

Tyson benefited from a much larger increase in operating profit margin: a TSR effect of 22 percent by increasing its margin from 4 percent to 9 percent, while J&J's margin was flat, at about 12 percent. Note that even though Tyson's

Interestingly, both companies earned similar ROIC in 2017, about 22 percent, because Tyson had higher capital productivity.

While the impact of increasing expectations (the change in multiple) was similar at the two companies, J&J's multiple remained at a much higher level. Tyson's EV/NOPAT multiple increased from 13 times to 17 times, while J&J's increased from 23 times to 29 times.

Tyson had a further seven-percentage-point advantage in TSR due to higher financial leverage. The impact of leverage on J&J's TSR was actually negative, because it had more cash than debt. In contrast, Tyson's debt added six percentage points to its TSR.

# UNDERSTANDING EXPECTATIONS

As the examples in this chapter have shown, investors' expectations at the beginning and end of the measurement period have a big effect on TSR. A crucial issue for investors and executives to understand, however, is that a company whose TSR has consistently outperformed the market will reach a point where the company will no longer be able to satisfy expectations reflected in its share price. From that point, TSR will be lower than it was in the past, even though the company may still be creating huge amounts of value. Managers need to realize and communicate to their boards and to investors that a small decline in TSR is better for shareholders in the long run at this juncture than a desperate attempt to maintain TSR through ill-advised acquisitions or new ventures.

This was arguably the point that Home Depot had reached in 1999. Earlier, we used earnings multiples to express expectations, but you can also translate those multiples into the revenue growth rate and ROIC required to satisfy current shareholder expectations by reverse engineering the share price. Such an exercise can also help managers assess their performance plans and spot any gaps between their likely outcome and the market's expectations. At the end of 1999, Home Depot had a market value of  \$132 billion, with an earnings multiple of 47. Using a discounted-cash-flow model that assumes constant margins and return on capital, Home Depot would have had to increase revenues by 26 percent per year over the next 15 years to maintain its 1999 share price. Home Depot's actual revenue growth through 2006 averaged a very healthy 13 percent per year, an impressive number for such a large company but far below the growth required to justify its share price in 1999. It's no surprise, therefore, that Home Depot's shares underperformed the S&P 500 by 8 percent per year over the period. Since then, Home Depot's revenues increased from\$ 90 billion in 2006 to \$108 billion in 2018, an annualized increase of 2 percent per year. A large part of the slow growth was due to the weakness in the housing market, with revenue dropping to \$66 billion in 2010 before recovering to the current level.

What should Home Depot's board of directors have done immediately after 1999, given the company's high market value? Celebrating is definitely not the answer. Some companies would try to justify their high share prices by considering all sorts of risky strategies. But given Home Depot's size, the chances of finding enough high-ROIC growth opportunities to justify its 1999 share price were virtually nil.

Realistically, there wasn't much Home Depot could have done except prepare for an inevitable decline in share price: Home Depot's market value dropped from  \$130 billion in December 1999 to\$ 80 billion in December 2006 (it increased to over 200 billion by mid-2019). Some companies can take advantage of their high share prices to make acquisitions. But that probably wasn't a good idea for Home Depot because of its high growth—a large-enough management challenge to maintain—even without considering that the retail industry doesn't have a track record of making large acquisitions successfully.

Home Depot's situation in 1999 was unusual. Most companies, most of the time, will not have much trouble satisfying the shareholder expectations expressed in their current share price simply by performing as well as the rest of their industry. We have reverse engineered hundreds of companies' share prices over the years using discounted cash flows. With the exception of the Internet bubble era (1999-2000), at least 80 percent of the companies have had performance expectations built into their share prices that are in line with industry growth expectations and returns on capital. TSR for a company among these 80 percent is unlikely to be much different from the industry average unless the company performs significantly better or worse than expected, relative to its industry peers. The other 20 percent, however, should brace themselves for a significantly faster or slower ride on the treadmill. Managers who reverse engineer their share prices to understand expectations of their ROIC and growth can benefit from seeing on which side of this 80/20 divide they fall.

# IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGERS

The expectations treadmill makes it difficult to use TSR as a performance measurement tool. As we saw in the example of Tyson and J&J Snack Foods, the sizable differences in TSR for the two companies from 2013 to 2017 masked the big difference in expectations at the beginning of the measurement period. In Home Depot's case, living up to the expectations was virtually impossible, as no company can run that fast for very long.

As a result of the expectations treadmill, many executive compensation systems tied to TSR do not reward managers for their performance as managers, since the majority of a company's short-term TSR is driven by movements in its industry and the broader market. That was the case for the many executives who became wealthy from stock options in the 1980s and 1990s, a time when share prices increased primarily because of falling inflation and interest rates, rather than anything those managers did. Conversely, many stock option gains were wiped out during the 2008 financial crisis. Again, the causes of these gains and losses were largely disconnected from anything managers did or didn't do (except for managers in financial institutions).

Instead of focusing primarily on a company's TSR over a given period, effective compensation systems should focus on growth, ROIC, and TSR performance relative to peers. That would eliminate much of the TSR that is not driven by company-specific performance.

In addition to fixing compensation systems, executives need to become much more sophisticated in their interpretation of TSR, especially short-term TSR. If executives and boards understand what expectations are built into their own and their peers' share prices, they can better anticipate how their actions might affect their own share prices when the market finds out about them. For example, if you're executing a great strategy that will create significant value, but the market already expects you to succeed, you can't expect to outperform on TSR. The management team and board need to know this, so the board will take a long-term view and continue to support management's value-creating priorities, even if these do not immediately strengthen the share price.

Executives also need to give up incessantly monitoring their stock prices. It's a bad habit. TSR is largely meaningless over short periods. In a typical three-month time frame, more than 40 percent of companies experience a share price increase or decrease of over 10 percent, movements that are nothing more than random. Therefore, executives shouldn't even try to understand daily share price changes unless prices move over 2 percent more than the peer average in a single day or 10 percent more in a quarter.

Finally, be careful what you wish for. All executives and investors like to see their company's share price increase. But once your share price rises, it's hard to keep it rising faster than the market average. The expectations treadmill is virtually impossible to escape, and we don't know any easy way to manage expectations down.
