## Return on Invested Capital

As Chapter 3 explains, the higher a company can raise its return on invested capital (ROIC), and the longer it can earn a rate of return on that capital greater than its cost of capital, the more value it will create. So it is critical to every strategic and investment decision to be able to understand and predict what drives and sustains ROIC.

Why do some companies develop and sustain much higher returns on capital than others? Consider a classic example from the days of the tech boom at the turn of the millennium. Two newcomers at the height of the boom in 2000 were the companies eBay and Webvan. In November 1999, eBay's market capitalization was  \$23 billion, while Webvan's was\$ 8 billion. Over the years that followed, eBay continued to prosper, reaching a market capitalization of more than \$70 billion in 2015, when it spun off its subsidiary PayPal. By mid-2018, the combined market capitalization of eBay and PayPal was more than \$160 billion. Webvan, in contrast, disappeared into bankruptcy and liquidation after just a few years. To understand why, we can look at what these companies' underlying strategies meant for their respective returns on invested capital.

The core business of eBay is an online marketplace that collects a small amount of money for each transaction between a buyer and a seller. The business needs no inventories or accounts receivable, and it requires little invested capital. Once the service started and a growing number of buyers used eBay, more sellers were attracted to it, in turn drawing in still more buyers. Moreover, the marginal cost of each additional buyer or seller is close to zero. Economists say that a business in a situation like eBay's exhibits increasing returns to scale. In such a business, the first competitor to grow big can generate a very high ROIC and will usually create the bulk of value in its market. If, as in eBay's case, the business easily expands across borders, the potential for value creation becomes even greater.

Webvan was an online grocery-delivery business based in California. In contrast to eBay, it had a capital-intensive business model involving substantial warehouses, trucks, and inventory. In addition, Webvan was competing with local grocery stores in selling products at very thin margins. The complexity and costs of making physical deliveries to customers within precise time frames more than offset Webvan's savings from not having physical stores. Finally, Webvan's business did not enjoy increasing returns to scale; as demand increased, it needed more food pickers, trucks, and drivers to serve customers.

From the outset, it was clear that eBay's business model had a sound and sustainable competitive advantage that permitted high returns. Webvan had no such advantage over its grocery store competitors. Whereas eBay's strategy was primed for success, Webvan's foreshadowed doom. In general, success in the online grocery business has since proven to be far more elusive than in other forms of online retail. For example, Amazon Fresh has faced challenges expanding beyond the most densely populated metropolitan areas. Amazon's 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods was one signal that in grocery, competition from traditional stores is hard to overcome.

The importance of ROIC is universal: it applies to companies as well as to businesses within companies. For example, within its retail business model, Amazon creates substantial revenues from third-party sellers using its online platform. Platform sales by third parties generate increasing returns to scale, more so than Amazon's direct sales. Platform sales require little invested capital, and Amazon's marginal cost of additional transactions is minimal. As a result, platform sales have become an important driver of Amazon's overall value creation.

This chapter explores how rates of return on invested capital depend on competitive advantage. We examine how strategy drives competitive advantage, which when properly fitted to industry structure and competitive behavior can produce and sustain a superior ROIC. This explains why some companies earn only a 10 percent ROIC while others earn 50 percent. The final part of the chapter presents 55 years of ROIC data by industry over time. This analysis shows how ROIC varies by industry and how rates of ROIC fluctuate or remain stable over time.

# WHAT DRIVES ROIC?

To understand how strategy, competitive advantage, and return on invested capital are linked, consider the following representation of ROIC:

$$
\mathrm {R O I C} = (1 - \text {T a x R a t e}) \frac {\text {P r i c e p e r U n i t} - \text {C o s t p e r U n i t}}{\text {I n v e s t e d C a p i t a l p e r U n i t}}
$$

This version of ROIC simply translates the typical formula of net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) divided by invested capital into a per unit calculation: price per unit, cost per unit, and invested capital per unit. To earn a higher ROIC, a company needs a competitive advantage that enables it to charge a price premium or produce its products more efficiently (at lower cost, lower capital per unit, or both). A company's competitive advantage depends on its chosen strategy and the industry in which it operates.

The strategy model that underlies our thinking about what drives competitive advantage and ROIC is the structure-conduct-performance (SCP) framework. According to this framework, the structure of an industry influences the conduct of the competitors, which in turn drives the performance of the companies in the industry. Originally developed in the 1930s by Edward Mason, this framework was not widely influential in business until Michael Porter published Competitive Strategy (Free Press, 1980), applying the model to company strategy. While there have been extensions and variations of the SCP model, such as the resource-based approach,[2] Porter's framework is probably still the most widely used for thinking about strategy.

According to Porter, the intensity of competition in an industry is determined by five forces: the threat of new entry, pressure from substitute products, the bargaining power of buyers, that of suppliers, and the degree of rivalry among existing competitors. Companies need to choose strategies that build competitive advantages to mitigate or change the pressure of these forces and achieve superior profitability. Because the five forces differ by industry, and because companies within the same industry can pursue different strategies, there can be significant variation in ROIC across and within industries.

Exhibit 8.1 underlines the importance of industry structure to ROIC. It compares the median return on invested capital over more than 20 years in two sectors: branded consumer goods and extraction industries (such as mining and oil and gas). Consumer goods have earned consistently higher ROICs than extraction companies. In addition, the returns of extraction-based companies have been highly volatile.

The reason for this difference in the industries' performances lies mainly in differences between their competitive structures. In the branded-consumer-goods industry, companies such as Nestlé, Procter & Gamble, and Unilever developed long-lasting brands with high consumer loyalty that made it difficult for new competitors to gain a foothold. Building on these advantages, these companies were able to increase their returns on capital from around 20 percent in the mid-1990s to roughly 30 percent two decades later, despite challenges to traditional brands from new market entrants. One example is

In extraction industries, one company's products are the same as another's (iron ore is iron ore, with minor quality differences), so prices are the same across the industry at any point in time. In addition, the companies use the same capital-intensive processes to extract their products. As a result, the median company in the industry doesn't have a competitive advantage, and returns are low, averaging only 9 percent during this 20-year period. It is worth noting that imbalances in supply and demand can lead to cycles in product price and ROIC, as was the case with a long run-up in commodity prices in the years leading up to 2005. In the end, though, competition leads to low ROIC on average.

Industry structure is by no means the only determinant of ROIC, as the significant variation among companies within industries shows. Consider the global automotive industry, which has been plagued by overcapacity for years. Still, the industry's low returns do not deter new entrants, whether from different geographies (such as South Korean automakers' entry into the U.S. and European markets) or due to the emergence of new technologies (such as electric-vehicle producers, including Tesla). Add in the difficulties that some manufacturers encounter in trying to close unionized plants, and it's easy to see how overcapacity keeps returns across the sector low. Only a few manufacturers, such as BMW, can parlay their premium brands and higher quality into higher prices and superior returns on capital compared with other manufacturers. Or consider the highly competitive European airline industry, where most players typically generate returns very close to their cost of capital—and occasionally below it. Nevertheless, Ryanair earns superior returns, thanks to its strategy of strictly point-to-point connections between predominantly secondary airports at the lowest cost in the industry.

Finally, industry structure and competitive behavior aren't fixed; they're subject to shocks from technological innovation, changes in government regulation, and competitive entry—any or all of which can affect individual companies or an entire industry. We show in this chapter's final section that the software and pharmaceutical industries, for example, consistently earn high returns. However, the leading companies may not be the same in 20 years, just as many of today's leaders were not major players or didn't even exist 20 years ago.

# COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

Competitive advantage derives from some combination of ten sources, defined in Exhibit 8.2. Of these, five allow companies to charge a price premium, four contribute to cost and capital efficiency, and one (often referred to as "network economies") combines price and cost advantages to produce increasing returns to scale. It is important to understand that competitive advantage drawn from these sources is enjoyed not by entire companies but by particular business units and product lines. This is the only level of competition at which the concept of competitive advantage affords you any real traction in strategic thinking; even if a company sells soup or dog food exclusively, it may still have individual businesses and product lines with very different degrees of competitive advantage and therefore different returns on invested capital.

On balance, price premiums offer any business the greatest scope for achieving an attractive ROIC, but they are usually more difficult to achieve than cost efficiencies. Also, the businesses or products with the highest returns are often those that weave together more than one advantage.

# Price Premium Advantages

In commodity markets, companies are typically price takers, meaning they must sell at the market price to generate sales, because the products are hard to differentiate. To sell its products at a price premium, a company must find a way to differentiate its products from those of competitors. We distinguish five sources of price premiums: innovative products, quality, brand, customer lock-in, and rational price discipline.

Innovative Products Innovative goods and services yield high returns on capital if they are protected by patents, are difficult to copy, or both. Absent these protections, even an innovative product won't do much to generate high returns.

Pharmaceutical companies earn high returns because they produce innovative products that, although often easy to copy, are protected by patents for up to 20 years. The business can charge a price premium during the protected period, after which generics will enter the market and drive the price down. Even after the patent expires, the holder may enjoy some price "stickiness."

An example of an innovative product line that is not patent protected but still difficult to copy was Apple's series of iPod MP3 players. MP3 players had been on the market for several years before Apple introduced the iPod, and the core technology was the same for all competitors. The iPod was more successful, however, because of its appealing design and ease of use afforded by its user interface and integration with iTunes. Apple followed a similar approach with the iPhone and iPad; once again, the design and user interface were core drivers of the price premium. Although not patent protected, good design can be difficult to copy.

Quality A term used as broadly as quality requires definition. In the context of competitive advantage and ROIC, quality means a real or perceived difference between one product or service and another for which consumers are willing to pay a higher price. In the car business, for example, BMW enjoys a price premium because customers perceive that its cars handle and drive better than comparable automobiles that cost less. The cost of providing the extra quality is less than the price premium. Hence, BMW has often been able to earn higher returns than many other carmakers. Appliance makers such as Weber can price their products at a premium over those of their competitors because customers perceive their reliability and durability to be superior.

Sometimes the perception of quality lasts significantly longer than any actual difference in quality. This has been the case with Honda and Toyota, relative to many automakers (at least until Toyota had to make product recalls in 2009). While American and Japanese cars have been comparable in terms of quantifiable quality measures, such as the J.D. Power survey, Japanese companies have enjoyed a price premium for their products. Even when American and Japanese sticker prices on comparable vehicles were the same, American manufacturers were often forced to sell at a  $2,000 to$ 3,000 discount, whereas Japanese cars sold for nearer the asking price.

Brand Price premiums based on brand are sometimes hard to distinguish from price premiums based on quality, and the two are highly correlated (as in the example of BMW). While the quality of a product may matter more than its established branding, sometimes the brand itself is what matters more—especially when the brand has lasted a very long time, as in the cases of Heineken, Coca-Cola, Perrier, and Mercedes-Benz.

Packaged food, beverages, and durable consumer goods are good examples of sectors where brands earn price premiums for some but not all products. In some categories, such as bottled water and breakfast cereals, customers are loyal to brands like Perrier and Cheerios despite the availability of high-quality branded and private-label alternatives. In other categories, including meat, branding has not been successful. Because of their strong brands, beverage and cereal companies can earn returns on capital of around 30 percent, while meat processors earn returns of around 15 percent.

Customer Lock-In When replacing one company's product or service with another's is relatively costly (relative to the price of the product) for customers, the incumbent company can charge a price premium—if not for the initial sale, then at least for additional units or for subsequent generations and iterations of the original product. Gillette's shaving products offer a classic example: the manufacturer realizes its margin not on the starter pack but on replacement razor blades. In consumer electronics, wireless-audio product manufacturers such as Sonos also create a form of lock-in: once customers have one or more loudspeakers installed, they are not likely to switch to other brands when replacing or adding units, as these would lack compatibility with their existing Sonos units.

High switching costs, relative to the price of the product or service, create the strongest customer lock-in. Medical devices, such as artificial joints, can lock in the doctors who purchase them, because doctors need time to train and become proficient in the procedures for using and/or implanting those devices. Once doctors are up to speed on a device, they won't switch to a competing product unless there is a compelling reason to invest the necessary effort. Similarly, bankers and traders who have invested considerable time in learning how to work with particular brands of financial terminals are often reluctant to learn another system. An installed base can be a powerful driver of competitive advantage.

Rational Price Discipline In commodity industries with many competitors, the laws of supply and demand will drive down prices and ROIC. This applies not just to obvious commodities—say, chemicals and paper—but also to more recently commoditized products and services, such as airline seats. It would take a net increase of only 5 to 10 percent in airline ticket prices to turn the industry's aggregate loss to an aggregate profit. But each competitor is tempted to get an edge in filling seats by keeping prices low, even when fuel prices and other costs rise for all competitors. In the past several years, the airline sector in the United States has rapidly consolidated and become more cautious about adding seat capacity. That has allowed U.S. airlines to operate at more attractive price levels and earn healthy returns on capital. In contrast, most European airlines still face strong price competition and are rarely able to earn returns on capital above their cost of capital.

Occasionally, we find an example such as the U.S. airline industry that manages to overcome the forces of competition and set its prices at a level that earns its companies reasonable returns on capital (though rarely more than 15 percent) without breaking competition law. For example, for many years, almost all real estate agents in the United States charged a 6 percent commission on the price of each home they sold. In other cases, government sanctions disciplined pricing in an industry through regulatory structures. Until the late 1990s, airline fares in Europe were high because in most national markets, foreign competitors faced restrictions when competing with domestic airlines. Prices collapsed when the European airline markets were fully deregulated in 1997.

Rational, legitimate pricing discipline typically works when one competitor acts as the leader and others quickly replicate its price moves. In addition, there must be barriers to new entrants, and each competitor must be large enough that a price war will surely reduce the profit on its existing volume by more than any extra profit gained from new sales. If there are smaller competitors with more to gain from extra volume than they would lose from lower prices, then price discipline will be very difficult to maintain.

Most attempts by industry players to maintain a floor price fail. Take the paper industry, for example. Its ROIC averaged less than 10 percent from 1990 to 2013. The industry created this problem for itself because the companies all tended to expand at once, after demand and prices had risen. As a result, a large chunk of new capacity came on line at the same time, upsetting the balance of supply and demand and forcing down prices and returns.

Even cartels (which are illegal in most of the world) find it difficult to maintain price levels, because each cartel member has a great incentive to lower prices and attract more sales. This so-called free-rider issue makes it difficult to maintain price levels over long periods, even for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the world's largest and most prominent cartel.

# Cost and Capital Efficiency Advantages

Theoretically, cost and capital efficiency are two separate competitive advantages. Cost efficiency is the ability to deliver products and services at a lower cost than the competition. Capital efficiency is about delivering more products per dollar of invested capital than competitors. In practice, both tend to share common drivers and are hard to separate. (Is a company's outsourcing of manufacturing to Asia a source of cost efficiency or capital efficiency?) Consequently, we treat the following four sources of competitive advantage as deriving from both the cost and capital efficiencies they achieve.

Innovative Business Method A company's business method is the combination of its production, logistics, and pattern of interaction with customers. Most production methods can be copied, but some are difficult to copy at some times. For example, early in its life, Dell developed a new way of making and distributing personal computers. Dell sold directly to its customers, made its machines to order with almost no inventory (by assembling machines with standardized parts that could be purchased from different suppliers at different times at very low cost), and received payments from customers as soon as products shipped. In contrast, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq, Dell's dominant competitors at that time, were producing in large batches and selling through retailers. Dell's cost and capital efficiency enabled the company initially to generate a much higher ROIC than its competitors, who couldn't switch quickly to a direct-sales model without angering their retailers and reengineering their production processes.

Notably, Dell's success formula eroded over time as its sales shifted from desktop to notebook computers. Notebook computers are built to much tighter part specifications, often using parts from vendors made expressly for Dell. Since everything must fit together just right, Dell needed more support from its vendors and saw its leverage over them diminished.

Sweden's IKEA provides another example of advantage gleaned from an innovative business method. IKEA transformed the home furniture business around the world, driving innovations in all steps of the business chain from design to manufacturing and distribution to sales. Its concept of self-assembly furniture reduces production and storage costs. Close collaboration in design and manufacturing minimizes product development costs and time. Manufacturing costs are kept low by using a limited range of raw materials. Its automated distribution centers are highly efficient because its product meets standard packaging requirements. Its retail stores are highly standardized and operate at low labor costs because customers pick up their furniture, still in packages, directly from storage. By making sure all these steps in the chain also stay carefully aligned with customer preferences, IKEA has become the largest furniture retailer in the world, operating more than 400 stores in more than 50 markets as of 2018.

Unique Resources Sometimes a company has access to a unique resource that cannot be replicated. This provides a significant competitive advantage. For example, in general, gold miners in North America earn higher returns than those in South Africa because the northern ore is closer to the surface, so extracting it is easier and costs less. These lower extraction costs are a primary driver of higher returns from North American mines (though partially offset by higher investment costs).

Another example is Nornickel's nickel mine in northern Siberia. The content of precious metals (e.g., palladium) in the mine's nickel ore is significantly higher than in the ore from Canadian and Indonesian mines. In other words, Nornickel extracts not only nickel from its ore but also some high-priced palladium. As a result, Siberian mines earn higher returns than other nickel mines.

Geography often plays a role in gaining advantage from unique resources. Obviously, most leading seaports and airports owe their success to their specific location. The Port of Rotterdam Authority operates the largest seaport of Europe, benefiting from a location that connects the Rhine River (Europe's busiest waterway) and the continent's largest economy (Germany) to the North Sea and global shipping routes. But geography is important not only for infrastructure companies. In general, whenever the cost of shipping a product is high relative to the value of the product, producers near their customers have a unique advantage. China is the largest consumer of iron ore. South American mines, therefore, face a distinct transportation cost disadvantage compared with Australian iron mines, and this contributes to the South American mines' lower returns compared with Australian competitors.

Economies of Scale The notion of economies of scale is often misunderstood to mean that there are automatic economies that come with size. Scale can indeed be important to value, but usually only at the regional or even local level, not in the national or global market. For example, for many retail businesses in dry cleaning, funeral services, or workspace rentals, it's much more important to be large in one city than large across the entire country, because local costs for facilities and advertising are either lumpy or fixed. Buying advertising airtime and space in Chicago is the same whether you have one store or a dozen. Likewise, a key element that determines the profitability of health insurers in the United States is their ability to negotiate prices with providers (hospitals and doctors), who tend to operate locally rather than nationally. The insurer with the highest market share in a local market will be in a position to negotiate the lowest prices, regardless of its national market share. In other words, it's better to have the number-one market share in ten states than to be number one nationwide but number four in every state.

Another aspect of scale economies is that a company derives benefit only if competitors cannot easily achieve similar scale. Sometimes the required investments are large enough to deter competitors. Anyone who wants to compete with United Parcel Service (UPS), for instance, must first pay the enormous fixed expense of installing an international network and then operate at a loss for quite some time while drawing customers away from the incumbent. Even though UPS continually must add new costs for planes, trucks, and drivers, these costs are variable—in contrast to the fixed cost of building the international network—and are incurred in stepwise fashion. That does not mean the industry is completely safe from competition. Over the past few years, Amazon has been building its own shipping network. Scale is less effective as a barrier to entry for Amazon: the company can rapidly reach sufficient scale thanks to its internal demand, and it has shown itself prepared and able to incur significant upfront investments.

Scalable Product or Process Having products or processes that are scalable means the cost of supplying or serving additional customers is very low at almost any level of scale. Businesses with this advantage usually deliver their products and services using information technology (IT). Consider a company that provides standardized software (in other words, a product that requires little customization). Once the software is developed, it can be sold to many customers with no incremental development costs. So the gross margin on incremental sales could be as high as 100 percent. As sales rise the only costs that increase are typically for selling, marketing, and administration.

For scalable software businesses, the upfront investments are not the only hurdle that competitors must deal with. Customers face costs of switching to other software providers, so competitors cannot easily achieve a similar scale as the incumbent player. That does not mean such competitive advantages last indefinitely, however; ongoing technological innovations in IT create opportunities for new competitors. For example, in financial and payments services, new entrants such as PayPal or Ayden have secured leading positions by starting new business models built on innovative technology platforms. Incumbent players, strapped with heritage organizations, systems, and processes, have found it difficult to copy the innovations.

Other examples of scalable businesses include media companies that make and distribute movies or TV shows. Making the movie or show requires an initial outlay for the crew, sets, actors, and so on. But those costs are fixed regardless of how many people end up viewing and paying for the show. There may be some incremental advertising costs and very small costs associated with putting the movie on DVD or streaming it. But overall, costs do not rise as customer numbers increase. In this case, it is the access to unique resources—namely, media content—that holds off competitors from capturing similar scale economies.

Most IT-based or IT-enabled businesses offer some form of scalability, especially given recent developments in cloud-based computing. But what counts is whether all critical elements of a business system are scalable. Take, for example, online food delivery businesses. These businesses can easily scale up in terms of number of registered restaurants, customers, and orders, but they still incur incremental costs for each individual order delivery, if only for transportation. Such costs still mount with the number of clients, which presents some limits on scalability and reduction of costs to serve as the business grows.

# Network Economies

Some scalable businesses models provide extraordinarily high returns on capital because they exhibit network economies that lead to increasing returns to scale. As the business gains customers and grows, the cost of offering the products decreases, and their value to customers increases. The eBay example we related at the beginning of this chapter illustrates this. Other examples are online lodging and travel platforms such as Airbnb and Booking.com. These models feature scalable products where the marginal cost of additional transactions is minimal. In addition, with scale, these platform services also become more valuable to both end customers and lodging providers. As a result, Airbnb and Booking.com can realize competitive advantages both in price and in cost and capital efficiencies.

Such sources of competitive advantage become even more powerful when customers face high switching costs. Consider a company like Microsoft. Its Office software benefits from scalable operations on the cost side because it can supply online products and services at extremely low marginal cost. Office has also become more valuable as the customer base has expanded over time. Microsoft has been able to lock in customers who want to easily exchange documents with other Office users and who are not keen to spend time and effort switching to alternative software. Some social-media business models, such as Facebook's, offer similar customer lock-in combined with increasing returns on scale.

Although many new digital business models for social media, digital marketplaces, and e-commerce like to claim such increasing returns to scale, they occur in rare circumstances only. Economists Carl Shapiro and Hal Variant popularized this concept in their 1998 book Information Rules.

The management implication of this insight was that in a business with increasing returns, it is important to get big faster than anyone else. Shapiro and Variant also explained the rare conditions under which it is possible to increase returns to scale. Sadly, executives who ignored that part of the book and pursued "network effects" faced disaster. For example, many U.S. electric-power producers tried to get big fast by buying up everything they could. Most collapsed, because there are no increasing returns from scaling electric-power production. Perhaps more important, such scale effects lead to superior lasting returns only if a company can prevent competitors from achieving similar scale.

# SUSTAINING RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL

The longer a company can sustain a high ROIC, the more value management will create. In a perfectly competitive economy, ROIC higher than the cost of capital get competed away. Whether a company can sustain a given level of ROIC depends on the length of the life cycles of its businesses and products, the length of time its competitive advantages can persist, and its potential for renewing businesses and products.

# Length of Product Life Cycle

The longer the life cycle of a company's businesses and products, the better its chances of sustaining its ROIC. To illustrate, while the products of companies such as Coca-Cola or Mars may not seem as exciting as the latest flashy electronics items, culturally entrenched, branded soft drinks and snacks are likely to have a market for far longer than many new gadgets. Similarly, a unique resource (like palladium-rich nickel ore) can be a durable source of advantage if it is related to a long product life cycle but will be less so if it isn't (this appears to be the case for lignite and coal today).

A business model that locks customers into a product with a short life cycle is far less valuable than one that locks customers in for a long time. Once users of Microsoft's Windows have become well versed in the platform, they are unlikely to switch to a new competitor. Even Linux, a low-cost alternative to Windows, has struggled to gain market share as system administrators and end users remain wary of learning a new way of computing. Microsoft's success in extending the life cycle of Windows has been a huge source of value to the company. Contrast this with a company like BlackBerry, which had an impressive customer base until the life cycle of its early smartphones was cut short by the introduction of the iPhone and other next-generation devices.

# Persistence of Competitive Advantage

If a company cannot prevent competition from duplicating its business, high ROIC will be short-lived, and the company's value will diminish. Consider two major cost improvements that airlines implemented over the past decade. The self-service kiosk and, more recently, the smartphone app allow passengers to purchase a ticket and to print or download a boarding pass from anywhere in the world without waiting in line. From the airlines' perspective, fewer ground personnel and equipment are needed to handle even more passengers. So why has this cost improvement not translated into high ROIC for the airlines? Since every company has access to the technology, any cost improvements are passed directly to the consumer in the form of lower prices. A similar example comes from robotic automation's ongoing effect on productivity improvements in automotive manufacturing: all players adopt the new technology and pass on the cost reductions to customers. In general, advantages that arise from brand and quality on the price side and scalability on the cost side tend to have more staying power than those arising from more temporary sources of advantage, such as an innovation that will tend to be superseded by subsequent innovations.

# Potential for Product Renewal

Few businesses or products have life cycles as long as Coca-Cola's. Most companies need to find renewal businesses and products where they can leverage existing advantages or build new ones. This is an area where brands prove their value. Consumer goods companies excel at using their brands to launch new products: think of Apple's success with the iPhone, Bulgari moving into fragrances, Mars entering the ice cream business, Netflix switching from DVD rentals by mail to video streaming online, John Deere offering information services to farmers, and Signify (the former Philips Lighting) developing connected lighting solutions such as Hue. Being good at innovation also helps companies renew products and businesses. Thus, pharmaceutical companies exist because they can discover new drugs, and semiconductor technology players such as ASML and Intel rely on their technology innovation to launch new products and stay ahead of competitors.

Some companies, such as Procter & Gamble and Alphabet's Google subsidiary, are able to maintain their primary product lines while simultaneously expanding into new markets. Google built new advertising and subscription businesses around, for example, YouTube and G Suite (which comprises Gmail, Calendar, and Google+) to complement the original advertising business that its search engine powers. Procter & Gamble has a strong record of continuing to introduce successful new products, including Swiffer, Febreze, and Crest Whitestrips. It also anticipated the strong growth in beauty products in the early 2000s with a number of acquisitions that increased its revenues in the category from  \$7.3 billion to\$ 20 billion from 1999 to 2013. Product development and renewal have enabled the company to advance from owning just a single billion-dollar brand (by sales) in 1999 to 23 such brands in 2013. Underlining its competitive strength in managing very large brands, Procter & Gamble announced in 2014 that it would discontinue or divest 90 to 100 smaller brands from a total of 180 brands in its portfolio.

As the next section of this chapter indicates, empirical studies show that over the past five decades, companies have been generally successful in sustaining their rates of ROIC. It appears that when companies have found a strategy that creates competitive advantages, they are often able to sustain and renew these advantages over many years. This also holds for the relatively new digital business models with which Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others have retained and renewed their competitive advantages for two decades and more. While competition clearly plays a major role in driving down ROIC, managers can sustain a high rate of return by anticipating and responding to changes in the environment better than their competitors do.

# AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL

Several key findings concerning ROIC emerge from a study of 1963-2017 returns on invested capital at U.S.-based nonfinancial companies with (inflation-adjusted) revenues greater than 1 billion:

- The median ROIC was stable at about 10 percent until the turn of the century and then increased to 17 percent after 2010, where it has remained since. Important drivers of this effect were a general increase in profitability across sectors, combined with a shift in the mix of U.S.-based companies to higher-returning sectors in life sciences and technology. These sectors not only significantly increased their ROIC, but also grew faster.
- Returns on invested capital differ by industry. Industries such as pharmaceuticals and branded consumer goods that rely on patents and brands for their sustainable competitive advantages tend to have high median ROIC, whereas companies in basic industries, such as oil and gas, mining, and utilities, tend to earn low ROIC.
- There are large variations in rates of ROIC within industries. Some companies earn attractive returns in industries where the median return is low (e.g., Walmart), and vice versa.
- Relative rates of ROIC across industries are generally stable, especially compared with rates of growth (discussed in the next chapter). Industry rankings by median ROIC do not change much over time, with only a few industries making a clear aggregate shift upward or downward. These shifts typically reflect structural changes, such as the widespread consolidation in the defense and airline industries over the past two decades and the maturing of the biotech industry. Individual company returns gradually tend toward their industry medians over time but are generally persistent. Even the 2008 financial crisis did not upset this trend.

# ROIC Trends and Drivers

Relatively stable ROIC levels from the early 1960s to the early 2000s are evident in Exhibit 8.3, which plots median ROIC between 1963 and 2017 for U.S.-based nonfinancial companies. In that exhibit, the measure of ROIC excludes goodwill and acquired intangibles, which allows us to focus on the underlying economics of companies without the distortion of premiums paid for acquisitions (discussed later in the chapter).

Until the 2000s, the median ROIC without goodwill was about 10 percent. Furthermore, annual medians oscillated in a tight range, with higher returns in high-GDP-growth years and lower returns in low-growth years. Since the 2000s, however, median ROIC without goodwill has increased to what appears to be a new level of about 17 percent in 2010 and beyond. Notice also that the spread between the first and third quartiles has widened. The first-quartile company earned around 5 to 7 percent during the entire period, while the third-quartile company's return has increased from the midteens to over 35 percent.

In fact, the entire distribution of ROIC has widened as more and more companies earn high returns on capital. Exhibit 8.4 shows the distribution of ROICs over different eras. In the 1965-1967 period, only 14 percent of companies earned more than a 20 percent ROIC, compared with 45 percent in 2015-2017. At the same time, the share of companies earning less than 10 percent has declined from 53 percent to 30 percent.

One factor powering the shift in the median ROIC is the steady increase of operating margins across sectors since the mid-1990s. As shown in Exhibit 8.5, the median operating margin (NOPAT over sales) has risen by two percentage points. When higher margins combine with improved capital productivity (lower invested capital over sales), returns on capital rise. The U.S. economy's changing industry mix serves as an even more powerful driver and helps to explain the widening dispersion of returns. Among U.S.-based nonfinancial companies, the share of operating profits from companies in the life science and technology sectors increased from 19 percent of total operating profits in 1995 to 38 percent in 2017.[8] This impressive increase has been driven by the

faster growth of these sectors relative to the rest of the economy, these sectors' generally higher margins and returns on capital, and increases in these sectors' margins and returns on capital. As a result, the life science and technology sectors generate six percentage points of the total 16 percent return on capital for the U.S. economy as a whole, compared with only two percentage points of a 12 percent overall return in 1995 (see Exhibit 8.6).

# ROIC by Industry

To see how differences in ROIC across industries and companies relate to likely differences in drivers of competitive advantage, we examined variations in ROIC by industry over the past two decades. Our findings are in line with results from prior editions of this book, in which we tracked profitability going back to the 1960s. Exhibit 8.7 shows the median returns on invested

 The ROIC contribution is calculated as the total NOPAT of the life science and technology sectors divided by the invested capital of all sectors. Note that the aggregate ROIC for the total sample is close to the median ROIC of  $12.4\%$  in 1995,  $16.7\%$  in 2005, and  $17.4\%$  in 2017.

The exhibit reveals large differences in median ROIC across industries. Not surprisingly, industries with the highest returns, such as pharmaceuticals, health-care equipment, and technology-related businesses, are those with sustainable competitive advantages. In the case of pharmaceuticals and health-care equipment, this is due to patent-protected innovation. In technology-related businesses, advantage typically flows from increasing returns to scale and customer lock-in. The branded consumer goods and luxury goods sectors have high returns thanks to customer loyalty based on brand strength. The industries at the bottom of the chart tend to be those where it is difficult to achieve a price premium or cost advantage—often commodity-based industries, including oil, gas, metals, and mining.

Industries typically recognized for having higher returns have often been the ones that also deliver the clearest improvements in ROIC over time. The reasons vary by sector. For example, leading aerospace and defense companies tend to focus on government contracts that include advance payments. This keeps the companies' invested capital at low levels relative to revenues. The biotechnology sector matured over the past 20 years with large companies such as Amgen and Gilead generating outstanding returns from the successful development and marketing of innovative blockbuster drugs. Finally, technology players benefited from growth and innovation in hardware (via semiconductors, servers, and smartphones) and in software and services. As markets became increasingly global, the shift to more scalable online software and information services also contributed to higher margins and returns; consider Facebook's and YouTube's growth in social media or Microsoft and Oracle in software. One outlier from this high-return club: the airline sector, which has

To some extent, the increases in ROIC reflect a trend across industries to lower capital intensity, as we observed in Exhibit 8.5. This could be interpreted as U.S. companies simply reducing their capital base—for example, by outsourcing operations without necessarily creating value.[10] This is not the case, however. Total economic profit for our sample of the largest U.S. companies increased from  \$31 billion in 1995 to\$ 560 billion in 2017. Moreover, economic profit increased for most sectors over the same period, with similar patterns as for ROIC.

Differences in ROIC within industries can be considerable. Exhibit 8.8 shows the variation between the first and third quartiles for the same industries. Note the wide range of returns in information services and software. Some of the companies in the sector earn low returns because they are capital intensive, and low margins because their business model is not scalable, as in the case of running data centers. Other companies provide services that are based on standardized and scalable software, where the incremental cost to serve a new customer is small, leading to high ROIC. In some industries, the largest players also generate the highest returns, and median ROIC does not reflect the aggregated ROIC for the sector as a whole (defined as NOPAT for the sector divided by its total invested capital). An example is the technology hardware sector, where players like Apple drive the aggregate ROIC to almost 70 percent, versus a median of 27 percent in 2015-2017.

This chart also shows that the best performers in a weaker or mediocre industry may outperform the median performer in a stronger industry. Consider, for example, retailing, shown in the bottom half of the chart. The stronger retailers (like Walmart) outperform the weaker companies in the media industry, which appears in the top half of the chart.

# Stability of ROIC

While industries often exhibit variations in their respective ROIC, many industries tend to remain fairly stable over time. We can see this by grouping the industry-level returns on invested capital according to whether they are relatively high, medium, or low. As shown in Exhibit 8.9, most industries stayed in the same group over the period we studied, starting in the early 1960s. In addition, some industries are cyclical, having high and low returns at different points in the cycle but demonstrating no clear trend up or down over time.

Persistently high-return industries included household and personal products, beverages, pharmaceuticals, and information services and software. These industries have consistently high returns because they are scalable or are protected by brands or patents. Persistently low returns characterize paper and forest products, railroads, and utilities. These are industries in which price premiums are difficult to achieve because of, for example, low barriers to entry, commodity products, or regulated returns. Perhaps surprisingly, this group also includes department stores. Like commodity industries, department stores can achieve little price differentiation, so as a rule, they realize persistently low returns.

EXHIBIT 8.9 Persistence of Industry ROIC

In several industries, there was a clear downward trend in returns. These included trucking, health care facilities, and automobiles. Competition in trucking, advertising, and automobiles has increased substantially over the past five decades. Health-care facilities have had their prices squeezed by the government, insurers, and competition with nonprofits.

Industries where returns on invested capital clearly are trending up are rare. Examples are health-care equipment, airlines, and aerospace and defense. Innovation in health-care equipment has enabled the industry to produce higher-value-added, differentiated products such as artificial joints, as well as more commoditized products, including syringes and forceps. As mentioned earlier, the U.S. airlines industry benefited from consolidation, and companies in aerospace and defense reduced their capital intensity as governments provided up-front funding for many more contracts.

There is similar evidence of sustained rates of return at the company level. We measured the sustainability of company ROIC in our database of nonfinancial corporations by ranking companies based on their ROIC in each year and dividing the group into quintiles. We treated each quintile as a portfolio and tracked the median ROIC for the portfolio over the following 15 years, as shown in Exhibit 8.10. The results indicate some mean reversion: companies earning high returns tended to see their ROIC fall gradually over the succeeding 15 years, and companies earning low returns tended to see them rise over time. Only in the portfolio containing companies generating returns between 5 and 10 percent (mostly regulated companies) do rates of return

remain constant. However, an important phenomenon is the persistence of superior performance beyond ten years. The returns of the best-performing companies do not decline all the way to the aggregate median over 15 years. High-performing companies are in general remarkably capable of sustaining a competitive advantage in their businesses and/or finding new business where they continue or rebuild such advantages. The pattern is stable over time—even over the most recent 15 years, which included the 2008 credit crisis (see Exhibit 8.11).

Since a company's continuing value is highly dependent on long-run forecasts of ROIC and growth, this result has important implications for corporate valuation. Basing a continuing value on the economic concept that ROIC will approach the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is overly conservative for the typical company generating high ROIC. (Continuing value is the focus of Chapter 14.)

Keeping this range of performance in mind, it is important when benchmarking the historical decay of company ROIC to segment results by industry, especially if industry is a proxy for sustainability of competitive advantage. As an example, Exhibit 8.12 plots the ROIC decay rates for branded consumer goods, again sorting the companies into five portfolios based on their starting ROICs. Here, the top-performing companies don't show much reversion to the mean. Even after 15 years, the original class of best performers still outperforms the bottom quintile by more than 13 percentage points.

Although decay rates examine the rate of regression toward the mean, they present only aggregate results and tell us nothing about the spread of potential future performance. Does every company generating returns greater than 20 percent eventually migrate to 15 percent, or do some companies actually go on to generate higher returns? Conversely, do some top performers become poor performers? To address this question, we measured the probability that a company will migrate from one ROIC grouping to another in ten years. The results are presented in Exhibit 8.13. Read each row from left to right.

# EXHIBIT 8.13 ROIC Transition Probability

Both high and low performers demonstrate significant stability in their performance. Companies with high or low ROIC are most likely to stay in the same grouping. A company whose ROIC was below 15 percent in 2007 had a 74 percent chance of earning less than 15 percent in 2017. For companies with a ROIC above 25 percent, the probability of maintaining that high performance was 70 percent. Among companies whose ROIC was between 15 and 25 percent in 2007, there was no clear tendency for companies to increase or decrease their ROIC ten years later.

# Effect of Acquisitions on ROIC

While returns on invested capital without goodwill have been increasing, returns on invested capital with goodwill have been flat, as shown in Exhibit 8.14. Companies paid high prices for their acquisitions, so much of the value the deals created was transferred to the shareholders of the target company. (Acquisitions and value creation are discussed in Chapter 31.) It does not mean that companies have failed to create value from acquisitions: returns on capital including goodwill above the cost of capital, combined with ongoing growth, indicate that they have created value above and beyond the price paid for these acquisitions. Increasing returns without goodwill indicates that companies have captured significant synergies to improve the performance of the acquired businesses.

For some industries, the differences in return with and without goodwill are even bigger than shown here. For the life science and technology sectors, for example, returns on capital including goodwill were around 25 percent, versus 65 percent without goodwill. Companies in this sector have created more value than any other sector, but shareholders of acquired companies captured much of it.

# SUMMARY

There is much to learn about returns on invested capital. First, these returns are driven by competitive advantages that enable companies to realize price premiums, cost and capital efficiencies, or some combination of these. Second, industry structure is an important—but not an exclusive—determinant of ROIC. Certain industries are more likely to earn either high, medium, or low returns, but there is still significant variation in the rates of return for individual companies within each industry. Third, and most important, if a company finds a formula or strategy that earns an attractive ROIC, there is a good chance it can sustain that attractive return over time and through changing economic, industry, and company conditions, especially in the case of industries that enjoy relatively long product life cycles. Of course, the converse also is true: if a company earns a low ROIC, that is likely to persist as well.
