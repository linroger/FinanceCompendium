# Growth

Growth and its pursuit grip the business world. The popular view is that a company must grow to survive and prosper. There is certainly some truth to this. Slow-growing companies present fewer interesting opportunities for managers and so may have difficulty attracting and retaining talent. They are also much more likely to be acquired than faster-growing firms. Over the past 25 years, most of the companies that have disappeared from the S&P 500 index were acquired by larger companies or went private.

However, as discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, growth creates value only when a company's new customers, projects, or acquisitions generate returns on invested capital (ROIC) greater than its cost of capital. And as companies grow larger and their industries become ever more competitive, finding good, high-value-creating projects becomes increasingly difficult. Striking the right balance between growth and return on invested capital is critically important to value creation. Our research shows that for companies with a high ROIC, shareholder returns are affected more by an increase in revenues than an increase in ROIC. Indeed, we have found that if such companies let their ROIC drop a bit (though not too much) to achieve higher growth, their returns to shareholders are higher than for companies that maintain or improve their high ROIC but grow more slowly. Conversely, for companies with a low ROIC, increasing it will create more value than growing the company will.

The previous chapter explored why executives need to understand whether their strategies will lead to high returns on invested capital. Similarly, they also need to know which growth opportunities will create the most value. This chapter discusses the principal strategies for driving revenue growth, the ways in which growth creates value, and the challenges of sustaining growth. It ends by analyzing the data on corporate growth patterns over the past 55 years.

# DRIVERS OF REVENUE GROWTH

When executives plan for growth, a good starting point is for them to disaggregate revenue growth into its three main components:2

1. Portfolio momentum. This is the organic revenue growth a company enjoys because of overall expansion in the market segments represented in its portfolio.
2. Market share performance. This is the organic revenue growth (or reduction) a company earns by gaining or losing share in any particular market.
3. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A). This represents the inorganic growth a company achieves when it buys or sells revenues through acquisitions or divestments.

Baghai, Smit, and Viguerie showed that for large companies, the most important source of growth by far was portfolio momentum. In other words, being in fast-growing markets was the largest driver of growth. Least important was market share growth. Yet managers tend to focus most of their attention on gaining share in their existing product markets. While it's necessary to maintain and sometimes increase market share, changing a company's exposure to growing and shrinking market segments should be a major focus.

To see the effect of portfolio momentum, consider how the median growth from 2008 to 2017 differs by industry (Exhibit 9.1). Not surprisingly, the fastest-growing sector over this period was biotechnology, which in 2008 was still a small industry that fueled impressive growth from a wave of innovative, blockbuster drugs. Makers of traditional pharmaceuticals delivered the second-highest growth, but mostly driven by consolidation rather than innovation, as many of the highest-selling drugs from the 1990s came off patent. For the same reason, airlines stand high on the list, with some of largest U.S. players having merged in the past decade. Compared with the prior decade, oil and gas companies dropped to a spot near the bottom of the list, primarily because of significant oil price decreases since 2014. These underlined the industry's cyclicality in terms of growth as well as ROIC, as discussed in the prior chapter. Note how a sector with high volume growth, such as technology hardware, nonetheless fails to beat many other sectors in terms of revenue growth (in contrast to other technology sectors, such as information services and software). Despite tremendous increases in volume, lower prices have kept total revenue growth relatively modest.

EXHIBIT 9.1 Variation in Revenue Growth by Industry

Exhibit 9.1 also shows widely varied growth within industries. For some sectors, such as pharmaceuticals and airlines, part of the variation can be explained by growth from mergers and acquisitions. In this instance, some players benefited, but not all. But for many other sectors, M&A cannot explain the wide variation in growth. If a company's growth depends mainly on the dynamics of the sector markets in which it operates, why should there be such big differences in growth among different companies operating in the same sector? The most important reason is that the median growth rate of companies competing in any sector masks big differences in growth across the sector's market segments and subsegments.

To understand markets in this fine-grained way and the differences in companies' revenue growth, Baghai, Smit, and Viguerie analyzed market growth at the level of individual product and geographical segments with around  \$50 million to\$ 200 million in sales, rather than at the company, divisional, or business unit level. Their example of a large European manufacturer of personal-care products shows why such analysis is revealing. The company has three divisions with apparently low prospective growth rates ranging from 1.6 percent to 7.5 percent a year. However, the range of forecast growth rates for individual product lines within the divisions is much wider. For instance, the division with the lowest expected growth rate has one product line growing at 24 percent, one of the company's best growth opportunities. At the same time, the division with the highest growth rate has several product lines that are shrinking fast and may warrant divestment.

# GROWTH AND VALUE CREATION

While managers typically strive for high growth, the highest growth will not necessarily create the most value. The reason is that the three drivers of growth (portfolio momentum, acquisitions, and market share gains) do not all create value in equal measure. To understand why not, consider who loses under alternative scenarios for revenue growth and how effectively losers can retaliate:

- Growth from increases in market share, particularly in slowand moderate-growth markets, rarely creates much value for long, because established competitors typically retaliate to protect their market shares. Lasting value creation could only occur in situations where smaller competitors are pushed out of the market entirely or where the company introduces differentiated products or services that are hard for competitors to copy.
- Growth driven by price increases comes at the expense of customers, who are likely to react by reducing consumption and seeking substitute products, so new value created by price increases may not last long either.
- Growth driven by general market expansion comes at the expense of companies in other industries, which may not even know to whom they are losing market share. This category of victim is the least able to retaliate, which makes product market growth the driver likely to create the most value.

EXHIBIT 9.2 Value Creation from Organic Growth Higher Than from Acquisitions

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-30/75ea39cc-041a-437e-9d57-dabed85d38b7/b0ec6e10e349780ccab67568c4a3a053b4c63f58c955dbd468a2b2753dda9e3a.jpg)

1 Excludes banks, insurance companies, extraction companies, and cyclical commodities.

- The value of growth from acquisitions is harder to characterize, because it depends so much on the price of the acquisition (as discussed in Chapter 31). However, as shown in Exhibit 9.2, a sample of 550 U.S. and European companies reveals that, in general, growth from acquisitions creates less value than organic growth. The main reason is that companies don't have to invest as much up front for organic growth. In growing through acquisitions, companies typically must pay for the stand-alone value of an acquired business plus a takeover premium. This results in a lower return on invested capital and lower value creation compared with growing organically.

# A Hierarchy of Growth Scenarios

It is possible to rank different growth scenarios that fall within the three overall growth strategies according to their potential for creating value (see Exhibit 9.3). This ranking may not be exactly the same for all industries, but it works well as a starting point. The scenarios with the highest potential to create value are all variations on entering fast-growing product markets that take revenues from distant companies, rather than from direct competitors or customers via price increases.

1 Per dollar of revenue.

Developing new products or services that are so innovative as to create entirely new product categories has the highest value-creating potential. The stronger the competitive advantage a company can establish in the new-product category, the higher will be its ROIC and the value created. For example, the coronary stent commercialized in the early 1990s reduced the need for heart surgery, lowering both the risk and cost of treating cardiac problems. Owing to this innovation's overwhelming competitive advantage over traditional treatments, as well as over subsequent products entering the market,[6] neither type of competitor could retaliate, so the innovators created large amounts of value. (As the stent market became highly competitive over the past decade, however, returns on capital have declined considerably.) Similarly, traditional music retailers have been all but competed away, first by online music sales giants such as iTunes and Amazon, and more recently as consumers have taken up online streaming services for mobile devices offered by Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and others. However, competition in the new digital-entertainment category is itself fierce, so the value created per dollar of revenue in this sector is unlikely to reach the levels that coronary stents once generated.

Next in the pecking order of value-creating growth tactics comes persuading existing customers to buy more of a product or related products. For example, if Procter & Gamble convinces customers to wash their hands more frequently, the market for hand soap will grow faster. Similarly, if antivirus software provider McAfee convinces computer owners that they need better protection against hackers and viruses, total demand for antivirus software and services will grow faster. Direct competitors will not respond, because they benefit as well. The ROIC associated with the additional revenue is likely to be high, because the companies' manufacturing and distribution systems can typically produce the additional products at little additional cost. Clearly, the benefit will not be as large if the company has to increase costs substantially to secure those sales. For example, offering bank customers insurance products requires the expense of an entirely new sales force, because the products are too complex to add to the list of products the bankers are already selling.

Attracting new customers to a market also can create substantial value. Consumer packaged-goods company Beiersdorf accelerated growth in sales of skin-care products by convincing men to use its Nivea products. Once again, competitors didn't retaliate because they also gained from the category expansion. Men's skin-care products aren't much different from women's, so much of the research and development, manufacturing, and distribution cost could be shared. The major incremental cost was for marketing and advertising.

The value a company can create from increasing market share depends on both the market's rate of growth and the way the company goes about gaining share. There are three main ways to grow market share, and these don't fall next to each other in our pecking order shown in Exhibit 9.3. When a company gains market share in a fast-growing market, the absolute revenues of its competitors may still be growing strongly, too, so the competitors may not retaliate. However, gaining share in a mature market is more likely to provoke retaliation by competitors.

Gaining share from incremental innovation—for example, through incremental technology improvements that neither fundamentally change a product nor create an entirely new category and that are possible to copy—won't create much value or maintain the advantage for long. From a customer's viewpoint, hybrid and electric vehicles aren't fundamentally different from gas or diesel vehicles, so they cannot command much of a price premium to offset their higher costs. The total number of vehicles sold will not increase, and if one company gains market share for a while, competitors will try to take it back, as competitors can copy each other's innovations before the innovator has been able to extract much value, if any. All in all, auto companies, whether new or incumbent, may not create much value from hybrid or electric vehicles; competition will likely transfer most benefits to consumers.

Gaining share through product pricing and promotion in a mature market rarely creates much value, if any. Huggies and Pampers dominate the disposable-diaper market and are financially strong, and each can easily respond if the other tries to gain share. Therefore, any growth arising from, say, an intense campaign to reduce prices that hits directly at the other competitor will provoke a response. And as Amazon continued expanding into the U.S.

consumer electronics retail market in 2009, Walmart reduced prices on key products such as top-selling video games and game consoles, even though Amazon's \$20 billion in sales in 2008 were a fraction of Walmart's \$406 billion sales in the same year. Although Walmart's competitive reaction could not stop Amazon from surpassing Walmart as the largest U.S. electronics retailer by 2014, it drove down margins across the segment and rewrote the competitive dynamics of the electronics category.

In concentrated markets, share battles often lead to a cycle of market share give-and-take but rarely to a permanent share gain for any one competitor, unless that competitor changes the product or its delivery enough to create what is effectively a new product. The possible exception, as with the Amazon example in the preceding paragraph, is stronger companies gaining share from smaller, weaker competitors and forcing the weaker players out of the market entirely.

Price increases, over and above cost increases, can create value as long as any resulting decline in sales volume is small. However, they tend not to be repeatable: if a company or several competitors get away with a price increase one year, they are unlikely to have the same good fortune the next. Furthermore, the first increase could be eroded fairly quickly. Otherwise, you would see some companies increasing their profit margins year after year, while in reality, long-term increases in profit margins are rare. There was an exception among packaged-goods companies in the mid-1990s. They passed on increases in commodity costs to customers but did not lower prices when their commodity costs subsequently declined. But the prospect of higher margins made it more attractive for retailers to enter the packaged-goods segments with offerings of private-label brands, sometimes via online sales channels.

There are two main approaches to growing through acquisitions. Growth through bolt-on acquisitions can create value if the premium paid for the target is not too high. Bolt-on acquisitions make incremental changes to a business model—for example, by completing or extending a company's product offering or filling gaps in its distribution system. In the 2000s, IBM was very successful in bolting on smaller software companies and subsequently marketing their applications through its existing global sales and distribution system, which could absorb the additional sales without too much extra investment. Because such acquisitions are relatively small, they boosted IBM's growth but added little cost and complexity.

In contrast, creating growth through large acquisitions—say, one-third the size or more of the acquiring company—tends to create less value. Large acquisitions typically occur when a market has begun to mature and the industry has excess capacity. While the acquiring company shows revenue growth, the combined revenues often do not increase, and sometimes they decrease because customers prefer to have multiple suppliers. Any new value comes primarily from cost cutting, not from growth. Furthermore, integrating the two companies requires significant investments and involves far more complexity and risk than integrating small, bolt-on acquisitions.

# Choosing a Growth Strategy

The logic explaining why growth from product market expansion creates greater and more sustainable value than growth from taking share is compelling. Nevertheless, the dividing line between the two types of growth can be fuzzy. For instance, some innovations prevent existing competitors from retaliating, even though the innovator's products and services may not appear to be that new. Walmart's innovative approach to retailing in the 1960s and 1970s offered an entirely new shopping experience to its customers, who flocked to the company's stores. One could argue that Walmart was merely taking share away from small local stores. But the fact that its competitors could not retaliate suggests that Walmart's approach constituted a truly innovative product. However, if Walmart were to grow by winning customers from Target, that would count as market share gain, because Target and Walmart offer their retailing product in a similar fashion. Notably, over the past decade, Walmart itself has been facing competition from innovative offerings in direct and platform sales by Amazon, which has taken significant market share from Walmart in many retail categories.

In general, underlying product market growth tends to create the most value. Companies should aim to be in the fastest-growing product markets, so they can achieve growth that consistently creates value. If a company is in the wrong markets and can't easily get into the right ones, it may do better by sustaining growth at the same level as its competitors while finding ways to improve and sustain its ROIC.

# WHY SUSTAINING GROWTH IS HARD

Sustaining high growth is much more difficult than sustaining ROIC, especially for larger companies. The math is simple. Suppose your core product markets are growing at the rate of the gross domestic product (GDP)—say, 5 percent nominal growth—and you currently have  \$10 billion in revenues. Ten years from now, assuming you grow at 5 percent a year, your revenues will be\$ 16.3 billion. Assume you aspire to grow organically at 8 percent a year. In ten years, your revenues will need to be \$21.6 billion. Therefore, you will need to find new sources of revenues that can grow to more than \$5.3 billion per year by the tenth year. Adjusting for inflation of 1 to 2 percent, you need an extra \$4.3 billion to \$4.8 billion per year in today's dollars. Another way to think of it is that to find such revenues, you would need to reinvent a

Given this difficulty, the growth targets that some companies embrace are simply unrealistic. One with sales already in excess of 5 billion announced organic growth targets of more than 20 percent a year for the next 20 years. Since annual world economic growth is typically less than 4 percent in real terms and many companies are competing for a share of that growth, such growth targets are hardly achievable.

Sustaining growth is difficult because most product markets have natural life cycles. The market for a product—which means the market for a narrow product category sold to a specific customer segment in a specific geography—typically follows an S-curve over its life cycle until maturity, as shown on the left side of Exhibit 9.4. The right side shows the growth curves for various real products, scaled to their relative penetration of U.S. households. First, a product has to prove itself with early adopters. Growth then accelerates as more people want to buy the product, until it reaches its point of maximum penetration. After this point of maturity, and depending on the nature of the product, either sales growth falls back to the same rate of growth as the population or the economy, or sales may start to shrink. To illustrate, autos and packaged snacks have continued to grow in line with economic growth for half a century or more, while videocassette recorders (VCRs) lasted less than 20 years before they started to decline and then disappeared.

While the pattern of growth is usually the same for every product and service, the amount and pace of growth will vary for each one. Exhibit 9.5

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-30/75ea39cc-041a-437e-9d57-dabed85d38b7/9eb2b8f9e2845bd8fd4cae30309ad756ecbea3ee94c19d3566dbcc9b932781f8.jpg)

EXHIBIT 9.6 The Challenge of Sustaining High Growth compares Walmart and eBay. While both have some activities outside their core business, they are largely one-product companies. Walmart's growth did not dip below 10 percent until the end of the 1990s, some 35 years after it was founded. In contrast, eBay saw its growth fall to below 10 percent after only 12 years, having grown very rapidly to reach maturity early. Because eBay is an Internet-based auction house, it doesn't need to add many more staff members in order to grow. In contrast, Walmart, as a physical retailer, has to add people as quickly as it adds stores and sales. The speed at which Walmart can hire and train people limits its rate of growth relative to eBay. But Walmart's core market is much larger than eBay's. In 2018, Walmart generated \$500 billion of revenues, mostly from its core discount and supercenter stores, whereas eBay generated only about \$10 billion of revenues because its core addressable market is so much smaller.[8]

Sustaining high growth presents major challenges to companies. Given the natural life cycle of products, the only way to achieve consistently high growth is to consistently find new product markets and enter them successfully in time to enjoy their more profitable high-growth phase. Exhibit 9.6 illustrates this by showing the cumulative sales for a company that introduces one new product in one market (geographic or customer segment) in each year. All products are identical in terms of sales volume and growth; their growth rates are very high in the beginning and eventually slow to 3 percent once the market is fully penetrated. Although the company continues to launch new products that are just as successful as their predecessors, aggregate sales growth slows down rapidly as the company gets bigger. In the long term, growth approaches 3 percent, equal to the long-term growth rate of the markets for the company's products. Ultimately, a company's growth and size are constrained by the growth and size of its product markets and the number of product markets in which it competes.

To sustain high growth, companies need to overcome this "portfolio treadmill" effect: for each product that matures and declines in revenues, the company needs to find a similar-size replacement product to stay level in revenues—and even more to continue growing. Think of the pharmaceutical industry, which showed unprecedented growth from the mid-1990s, thanks to so-called blockbuster drugs such as Lipitor and Celebrex. Then growth plummeted as these drugs came off patent and the next generation of drugs didn't deliver the same outsize sales as the blockbusters. Finding sizable new sources of growth requires more experimentation and a longer time horizon than many companies are willing to invest in. Royal Philips's health technology business was a small corporate division in 1998, when it generated around 7 percent of total company revenues. It took 15 years of ongoing investments and acquisitions to become Philips's largest business unit, generating half of its total revenues. After the carve-out of its lighting business and other divestitures, health technology has now become Philips's core business.

# EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF CORPORATE GROWTH

The empirical research backs up the principles we have been discussing. This section presents our findings on the level and persistence of corporate growth for U.S.-based nonfinancial companies with revenues greater than 1 billion (inflation-adjusted) from 1963 to 2017. (The sample size for each year is different but amounts to 1,095 companies in 2017.) The analysis of their revenue growth follows the same procedure as the analysis of ROIC data in Chapter 8, except here we use three-year rolling averages to moderate distortions caused by currency fluctuations and M&A activity. We also use real, rather than nominal, data to analyze all corporate growth results, because even mature companies saw a dramatic increase in revenues during the 1970s as inflation increased prices. Ideally, we would report statistics on organic revenue growth, but current reporting standards do not require companies to disclose the effects of currencies and M&A on their revenues.

The overall findings concerning revenue growth are as follows:

- The median rate of revenue growth between 1965 and 2017 was 4.9 percent in real (inflation-adjusted) terms. Real revenue growth fluctuated significantly, ranging from around 0 percent to 9 percent, with significant cyclicality.
- High growth rates decayed very quickly. Companies growing faster than 20 percent in real terms typically grew at only 8 percent within five years and at 5 percent within ten years.

# Growth Trends

Let's begin by examining aggregate levels and trends of corporate growth. Exhibit 9.7 presents median revenue growth rates in real terms between 1965 and 2017. The average median revenue growth rate for that period equals 4.9 percent per year and oscillates between roughly 0 percent and 9 percent. Median revenue growth demonstrates no trend over time, but over the past five years, growth rates declined to around 2 percent in real terms.

Real revenue growth of 4.9 percent is quite high when compared with real GDP growth in the United States, which was at 3.0 percent during the same period. Why the difference? Possible explanations abound. The first is self-selection: companies with good growth opportunities need capital to grow. Since public markets are large and liquid, high-growth companies are more likely to be publicly traded than privately held ones. We measure only publicly traded companies, so these growth results are likely to be higher.

Second, as companies become increasingly specialized and outsource more services, firms providing services will grow and develop quickly without affecting the GDP figures. Consider Jabil Circuit, a contract electronics manufacturer. When a company like Apple or IBM has Jabil manufacture products or components on its behalf, GDP, which measures aggregate output, will not change. Yet Jabil's growth will influence our sample.

A third explanation is global expansion. Many of the companies in the sample create products and generate revenue outside the United States, so they can grow faster than U.S. GDP without gaining sales in the United States. Finally, although we use rolling averages and medians, these cannot eliminate but only dampen the effects of M&A and currency fluctuations, which do not reflect organic growth.

EXHIBIT 9.8 Distribution of Growth Rates

In addition to mapping median growth, Exhibit 9.7 also reveals that from the mid-1970s to 2017, at least one-quarter of all companies shrank in real terms almost every year. Thus, although most companies project healthy growth over the next years in their public communications or even analyst guidance, the reality is that many mature firms will shrink. This underlines the need to exercise caution before projecting strong growth for a valuation, especially for large companies in mature sectors.

Exhibit 9.8 shows the distribution of three-year real revenue growth for two periods, 1997-2007 (before the 2008 financial crisis) and 2007-2017. Not surprisingly, the distribution became wider and shifted to the left in the latter period. From 2007 to 2017, almost two-thirds of companies in the sample grew at an annual real rate of less than 5 percent. Only 21 percent grew faster than 10 percent. (This includes the effect of acquisitions, so fewer companies grew faster than 10 percent just through organic growth.)

# Growth across Industries

As Exhibit 9.1 illustrated, growth rates vary widely across and within industries. In addition—unlike ROIC, where the industry ranking tends to be stable—the industry growth ranking varies significantly over time, as shown in Exhibit 9.9 for the decades 1997–2007 and 2007–2017. Some of the variation is explained by structural factors, such as the saturation of markets (the declining growth in hotels and restaurants and in chemicals) or the effect of technological innovation in creating entirely new markets (the strong growth in biotechnology and information services). In other cases, growth is more cyclical. Growth in the oil and gas sector varied from more than 10 percent in the first decade to just 1 percent over the past ten years, as oil prices plummeted after 2014. Similarly, the construction industry is subject to cycles, with growth

at much lower levels since the 2008 credit crisis. Telecommunications service providers enjoyed a burst of growth in the 2000s, when mobile phones became ubiquitous. But revenue growth rates over the past decade ended significantly lower due to strong price pressure.

Despite this high degree of variation, some sectors have consistently been among the fastest growing, not only during the 30 years covered in this sample, but also for earlier periods. These include life sciences and technology, such as information services and software, technology hardware, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and health care, where demand has remained strong for three decades. Others, such as automobile parts, chemicals, and branded consumer goods, have consistently registered lower growth rates, as their markets had already reached maturity well before the 1990s.

# Sustaining Growth

Understanding a company's potential for growing revenues in the future is critical to valuation and strategy assessment. Yet developing reasonable projections is a challenge, especially given the upward bias in growth expectations demonstrated by equity research analysts and the media. Research shows that analyst forecasts of one-year-out aggregate earnings growth for the S&P 500 are systematically overoptimistic, exceeding actual earnings growth by five percentage points or more.[9]

To put long-term corporate growth rates in their proper perspective, we analyzed historical rates of growth decay since 1963. Companies were segmented into five portfolios, depending on their growth rate in the year the portfolio was formed. Exhibit 9.10 plots how each portfolio's median company grows over time. As the exhibit shows, growth decays very quickly; high growth is not sustainable for the typical company. Within three years, the difference across portfolios narrows considerably, and by year 5, the highest-growth portfolio outperforms the lowest-growth portfolio by less than five percentage points. Within ten years, this difference drops to less than two percentage points.

We also analyzed the decay rates for the most recent 15 years and found similar patterns of rapid convergence to 5 percent and lower (Exhibit 9.11). Note how the 2008 credit crisis caused a temporary decline of growth rates overall but without changing the typical decay pattern from the long-term data in Exhibit 9.10. Comparing the decay of growth to that of ROIC shown in the previous chapter, it is possible to see that although companies' rates of return on invested capital generally remain fairly stable over time—top companies still outperform bottom companies by more than ten percentage points after 15 years—rates of growth do not.

As discussed earlier in this chapter, companies struggle to maintain high growth because product life cycles are finite and growing becomes more difficult as companies get bigger. Do any companies counter this norm? The short answer: very few. Exhibit 9.12 shows what happened to the growth rates of companies grouped by their 2004-2007 growth rates. Reading across each row, the percentages indicate the share of companies in each group that fell into each of the growth categories one decade later. Clearly, maintaining high growth is much less common than being stuck with slow growth. Of the companies reporting less than 5 percent revenue growth from 2004 to 2007, 68 percent continued to report growth below 5 percent ten years later. In contrast, only 21 percent of high-growth companies maintained better than 15 percent real growth ten years later. Even more concerning for high-growth companies, 58 percent of the companies that grew faster than 15 percent from 2004 to 2007 were growing at real rates below 5 percent a decade later. Sustaining high growth is very difficult—much more difficult than sustaining high ROIC.

EXHIBIT 9.12 Revenue Growth Transition Probability

# SUMMARY

To maximize value for their shareholders, companies should understand what drives growth and how it creates value. For large companies, the growth of the markets in which they operate largely drives long-term revenue growth. Although gains in market share contribute to revenues in the short term, these gains are far less important for long-term growth.

Revenue growth is not all that matters for creating value; the value created per dollar of additional revenues is the crucial point. In general, this depends on how easily competitors can respond to a company's growth strategy. The growth strategy with the highest potential in this respect is true product innovation, because entirely new product categories by definition have no established competition. Attracting new customers to an existing product or persuading existing customers to buy more of it also can create substantial value, because direct competitors in the same market tend to benefit as well. Growth through bolt-on acquisitions can add value, because such acquisitions can boost revenue growth at little additional cost and complexity. Typically, revenue growth from market share gains is much less attractive, because it comes at the expense of established direct competitors, who are likely to retaliate, especially in maturing markets.

Sustaining high growth is no less a challenge than initiating it. Because most products have natural life cycles, the only way to achieve lasting high growth is to continue introducing new products at an increasing rate—which is nearly impossible. Not surprisingly, growth rates for large companies decay much faster than do returns on invested capital; growth rates for even the fastest-growing companies tend to fall below 5 percent within ten years.
