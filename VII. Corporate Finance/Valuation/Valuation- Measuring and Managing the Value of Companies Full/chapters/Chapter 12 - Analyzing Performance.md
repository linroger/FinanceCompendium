# Analyzing Performance

Understanding a company's past is essential to forecasting its future, so a thorough analysis of historical performance is a critical component of valuation. Always begin with the core elements of value creation: return on invested capital (ROIC) and revenue growth. Examine trends in the company's long-run performance and its performance relative to that of its peers, so you can base your forecasts of future cash flows on reasonable assumptions about the company's key value drivers.

Start by analyzing ROIC, both with and without goodwill. ROIC with goodwill measures the company's ability to create value over and above premiums paid for acquisitions. ROIC without goodwill is a better measure of the company's underlying operating performance compared with that of its peers. Then drill down into the components of ROIC to build an integrated view of the company's operating performance and understand which aspects of the business are responsible for its overall performance. Next, examine what drives revenue growth. Does revenue growth stem, for instance, more from organic growth or from currency effects, which are largely beyond management control and probably not sustainable? Finally, assess the company's financial health to determine whether it has the financial resources to conduct business and make investments for growth.

# ANALYZING RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL

Chapter 11 reorganized the income statement into net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) and the balance sheet into invested capital. ROIC measures the ratio of NOPAT to invested capital:

$$
\mathrm {R O I C} = \frac {\mathrm {N O P A T}}{\text {I n v e s t e d C a p i t a l}}
$$

Companies that report ROIC in their annual reports may compute it using starting invested capital, ending capital, or the average of the two. Since profit is measured over an entire year, whereas capital is measured only at one point in time, we recommend that you average starting and ending invested capital. If the business is highly seasonal, such that capital is changing substantially at the company's fiscal close, consider using quarterly averages.

ROIC is a better analytical tool than return on equity (ROE) or return on assets (ROA) for understanding the company's performance because it focuses solely on a company's operations. ROE mixes operating performance with capital structure, making peer-group analysis and trend analysis less insightful. ROA—even when calculated on a pre-interest basis—is an inadequate measure of performance because it includes nonoperating assets and ignores the benefits of accounts payable and other operating liabilities that together reduce the amount of capital required from investors.

As an example of using ROIC to analyze performance, Exhibit 12.1 plots ROIC for Costco and the median of its peers from 2015 to 2019, based on the NOPAT and invested-capital calculations presented in Chapter 11. Costco has consistently earned higher returns on invested capital than its peers, and

showed significant increases in 2018 and 2019. As we will show later, Costco's higher ROIC can be traced to its lower operating profit margin offset by strong capital productivity.

# Analyzing ROIC with and without Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles

Goodwill and acquired intangibles are intangible assets purchased in an acquisition. ROIC should be computed both with and without goodwill and acquired intangibles. In our analysis, we treat goodwill identically to acquired intangibles. Therefore, we will often shorten the expression goodwill and acquired intangibles to simply goodwill.

The reason to compute ROIC with and without goodwill is that each ratio analyzes different things. ROIC with goodwill measures whether the company has earned adequate returns for shareholders, factoring in the price paid for acquisitions. ROIC excluding goodwill measures the underlying operating performance of a company. It tells you whether the underlying economics generate ROIC above the cost of capital. It can be used to compare a company's performance against that of peers and to analyze trends. It is not affected by the price premiums paid for acquisitions. ROIC without goodwill is also more relevant for projecting future cash flows and setting strategy. A company does not need to spend more on acquisitions to grow organically, so ROIC without goodwill is a more relevant baseline for forecasting cash flows. Finally, companies that have a high ROIC without goodwill will likely create more value from growth, while companies that have low ROIC without goodwill will likely create more value by improving ROIC.

Costco doesn't have any goodwill, having grown entirely organically, but for companies that make significant acquisitions, the difference between ROIC with and without goodwill can be large. Exhibit 12.2 presents ROIC with and without goodwill for the U.S. luxury-goods maker Tapestry, formerly known as Coach. In 2017, the company purchased Kate Spade, a luxury fashion design house, for 2.4 billion in cash. Since the two companies had quite similar returns on capital, Tapestry's ROIC without goodwill remained fairly constant before and after the acquisition. In contrast, ROIC with goodwill after the acquisition fell from 24 percent to 12 percent in 2017. Does the decline in ROIC when measured with goodwill imply that the acquisition destroyed value? Not necessarily: cost savings and cross-selling opportunities take time to realize, and Tapestry's access to new customers, especially millennials, may accelerate growth in its own product lines.

EXHIBIT 12.2 Tapestry: Return on Invested Capital

Accurately evaluating ROIC with goodwill leads to a second challenge: ROIC may increase even without improvements to the underlying business. We've seen situations where a business unit submitted a new strategic plan saying it expected to improve its ROIC over time. On the surface, its forecast looked impressive, but we then discovered that the ROIC included goodwill, and the expected improvement in ROIC would be caused solely by goodwill remaining constant as the business grew profits organically. The management team would earn accolades for improving ROIC purely as a result of the accounting for goodwill, not an underlying improvement to the business.

# Decomposing ROIC to Develop an Integrated Perspective of Company Economics

To show how we analyze a company's economics based on decomposition of its ROIC, we return to the example of Costco and its peers. Costco has consistently earned a higher ROIC than its peers. But what caused this difference in performance? To understand which elements of a company's business are driving the company's ROIC, split apart the ratio as follows:

$$
\mathrm {R O I C} = (1 - \text {O p e r a t i n g C a s h T a x R a t e}) \times \frac {\text {E B I T A}}{\text {R e v e n u e s}} \times \frac {\text {R e v e n u e s}}{\text {I n v e s t e d C a p i t a l}}
$$

The preceding equation is one of the most powerful equations in financial analysis. It demonstrates the extent to which a company's ROIC is driven by

EXHIBIT 12.3 Costco versus Peer Group: ROIC Tree, 2018

To match economic-profit valuation, invested capital is measured at beginning of year.

its ability to maximize profitability (EBITA divided by revenues, or the operating margin), optimize capital turnover (measured by revenues over invested capital), or minimize operating taxes.

Each of these components can be further disaggregated, so that each expense and capital item can be analyzed, line item by line item. Exhibit 12.3 shows how the components can be organized into a tree. On the right side of the tree are operational financial ratios, the drivers of value over which managers have control. Reading from right to left, each subsequent box is a function of the boxes to its right. For example, operating margin equals 100 percent less the ratios of cost of sales to revenues, selling and general expenses to revenues, and other operating expenses to revenues. Pretax ROIC equals operating margin times capital turnover (revenues divided by invested capital), and so on.

Once you have calculated the historical drivers of ROIC, compare them with the ROIC drivers of other companies in the same industry. You can then weigh this perspective against your analysis of the industry structure (opportunities for differentiation, barriers to entry or exit, etc.) and a qualitative assessment of the company's strengths and weaknesses.

To illustrate, let's examine the difference between Costco and its peers. In 2018, Costco's ROIC with goodwill equaled 17.7 percent, compared with its peers' median of 11.6 percent. The difference is somewhat smaller without goodwill, because Costco had no goodwill. You might ask what drives Costco's higher ROIC. Costco has an unusual business model for a retailer. It doesn't mark up its costs as much as other retailers, leading to a higher cost of sales relative to revenues. It makes up for that with lower selling and general expenses. For example, its warehouse format has much lower depreciation, and its cost to stock shelves is lower because it doesn't put items on the shelves individually but instead uses the manufacturers' containers. Costco also sells larger sizes of its products with a smaller assortment to manage. Despite the lower selling and general expenses, it still ends up with a lower operating profit margin (3.2 percent, versus 5.1 percent). It makes up for this with higher capital productivity—primarily much lower fixed assets relative to sales.

Line Item Analysis A comprehensive valuation model will convert every line item in the company's financial statements into some type of ratio. For the income statement, most items are taken as a percentage of sales. (Exceptions exist: operating cash taxes, for instance, should be calculated as a percentage of pretax operating profits, not as a percentage of sales.)

For the balance sheet, each line item can also be taken as a percentage of revenues (or as a percentage of cost of goods sold for inventories and payables, to avoid distortion caused by changing prices). For operating current assets and liabilities, you can also convert each line item into days, using the following formula:

$$
\mathrm {D a y s} = 3 6 5 \times \frac {\text {B a l a n c e S h e e t I t e m}}{\text {R e v e n u e s}}
$$

If the business is seasonal, operating ratios such as inventories should be calculated using quarterly data. The differences can be quite substantial.

The use of days lends itself to a simple operational interpretation. How much cash is tied up in the business, and for how long? As Exhibit 12.4 demonstrates, Costco and its peers have negative working capital, with Costco's somewhat lower. Costco's product selection and business model results in lower levels of inventory and accounts payable. In 2018, it had only 30.9 days of inventory, versus 52.7 for its peers. In other words, goods don't stay on Costco's shelves

as long as they do at its peers'. Costco also has lower accounts payable days (30.9 versus 54.4 in 2018). This means it pays its suppliers faster, perhaps to get better prices.

Operating Analysis Using Nonfinancial Drivers In an external analysis, ratios are often confined to financial performance. If you are working from inside a company, however, or if the company releases operating data, link operating drivers directly to return on invested capital. By evaluating the operating drivers, you can better assess whether any differences in financial performance between competitors are sustainable.

Consider airlines, which are required for safety reasons to release a tremendous amount of operating data. Exhibit 12.5 details financial and operating data for two U.S. carriers we'll refer to as Airline A and Airline B between 2016 and 2018. Operating statistics include the number of employees, measured using full-time equivalents, and available seat-miles (ASMs), the common measurement of capacity for U.S. airlines.

Exhibit 12.6 transforms the data presented in Exhibit 12.5 into the operating-margin branch on the ROIC tree. Operating margin (operating profit divided by revenues) equals 9.1 percent for Airline A and 9.4 percent for Airline B. For airlines, operating margin is driven by three primary accounts: aircraft fuel, labor expenses, and other expenses. At first glance, it appears that Airlines A and B have similar labor costs. Labor expenses as a percentage of revenues average 27.7 percent for Airline A and 26.7 percent for Airline B. But

EXHIBIT 12.5 Airline A and Airline B: Financial and Operating Statistics

To see why, disaggregate the ratio of labor expenses to revenues using available seat-miles (ASMs):

$$
\frac {\text {L a b o r E x p e n s e s}}{\text {R e v e n u e s}} = \left(\frac {\text {L a b o r E x p e n s e s}}{\text {A S M s}}\right) \div \left(\frac {\text {R e v e n u e s}}{\text {A S M s}}\right)
$$

The ratio of labor expenses to revenues is a function of labor expenses per ASM and revenues per ASM. Labor expenses per ASM are the labor costs required to fly one ASM, and revenues per ASM represent the average price charged per ASM. Although Airlines A and B have similar ratios of labor expenses to revenues, they have different operating models. Airline B has an 18 percent advantage in labor cost per ASM ($34.1 per thousand ASMs versus $41.6 for Airline A). But what Airline A loses in labor costs, it recovers with higher prices. Because of its locations and reach, especially internationally, Airline A can charge an average price 17 percent higher than Airline B ($150.0 per thousand ASMs versus $127.9 per thousand ASMs).

But what is driving this differential in labor expenses per ASM? Are Airline B's employees more productive? Or are they paid less? To answer these questions, disaggregate labor expenses to ASMs, using the following equation:

$$
\frac {\text {L a b o r E x p e n s e s}}{\text {A S M}} = \left(\frac {\text {L a b o r E x p e n s e s}}{\text {E m p l o y e e s}}\right) \div \left(\frac {\text {A S M s}}{\text {E m p l o y e e s}}\right)
$$

Two elements drive labor expenses per ASM: the first term represents the average salary per full-time employee; the second measures the productivity of each full-time employee (millions of ASMs flown per employee). The boxes on the right side of Exhibit 12.6 report the calculations for this equation. The

Available seat-miles (ASMs) are the standard unit of measure for the U.S. airline industry.

average salary is 16.4 percent higher for Airline A, while productivity per mile is 4.6 percent lower. Although the salary differential appears significant, it is quite small in 2018 compared with the early 2000s, when average salaries differed by a factor of almost 2. Furthermore, the differences in productivity can be driven by different route structures and the level of service provided.

Analyzing performance using operating drivers gives additional insight into the competitive differences among airlines. But the analysis is far from done. In fact, a thoughtful analysis will often raise more questions than it answers. For instance, can the salary difference between Airline A and Airline B be explained by the mix of employees (pilots are more expensive than gate personnel) or the location of the employees (the East and West coasts are more expensive than the Midwest)? Each of these analyses will provide additional insight into each carrier type's ability to survive and prosper.

# ANALYZING REVENUE GROWTH

Chapter 3 showed that ROIC, cost of capital, and growth in cash flows drive a company's value. By analyzing historical revenue growth, you can assess the potential for growth in the future.

The calculation of year-to-year revenue growth is straightforward, but the results can be misleading. Three prime culprits distort revenue growth: the effects of changes in currency values, mergers and acquisitions, and changes in

EXHIBIT 12.7 Compass and Sodom: Revenue Growth Analysis

Strip out any distortions created by these effects to arrive at a better forecast of organic revenue growth.

Exhibit 12.7 demonstrates how misleading raw year-to-year revenue growth figures can be. Compass (based in the United Kingdom) and Sodexo (based in France) are global providers of canteen services in businesses, health systems, schools, and sporting venues. As shown in the bottom line of the exhibit for 2017, total revenues at Compass grew by 15.1 percent, and revenues at Sodexo grew by just 2.2 percent. The difference in growth rates appears dramatic but is driven primarily by changes in currency values (pounds sterling versus euros), not by long-term stable organic revenue growth. When we strip out these and other distortions, we see that like-for-like organic revenue growth at Compass (4.0 percent) still exceeded Sodexo's revenue growth (1.9 percent), but by a much smaller amount.

In general, for large multinationals, swings in currency values and changes in corporate portfolios can make historical revenue growth extremely volatile, so benchmarking is difficult. At Compass, reported revenue growth fell from a high of 15.1 percent in 2017 to just 1.8 percent in 2018. This stands in stark contrast to the company's relatively stable organic revenue growth: between 4.0 and 5.5 percent over the same time period.

The next three sections discuss in detail each of the major sources of distortions—changes in currency values, mergers and acquisitions, and changes in accounting policies. For each, we consider its effect on performance measurement, forecasting, and, ultimately, valuation.

# Currency Effects

Multinational companies conduct business in many currencies. At the end of each reporting period, these revenues are converted to the home currency of the reporting company. If foreign currencies are rising in value relative to the company's home currency, this translation at better rates will lead to higher revenue numbers. Thus, a rise in revenue may not reflect increased pricing power or greater quantities sold, but simply depreciation in the company's home currency.

Compass and Sodexo are two companies exposed to foreign currency. The companies have similar geographic mixes, with nearly half of each company's revenues coming from North America. Since each company translates U.S. dollars into a different currency for its consolidated financial statements, however, exchange rates will affect each company quite differently.

Compass translates U.S. dollars from its North American business into pounds. Given the weakening of the pound against the U.S. dollar ( $1.51 per pound in 2015 versus$ 1.30 per pound by 2017), Compass reported an increase in revenues of 5.4 percent in 2016 and 11.3 percent in 2017 attributable to the weakening pound, shown as "currency effects" in Exhibit 12.7. For Sodexo, exchange rates had the opposite effect. As the euro strengthened slightly against the dollar, Sodexo translated revenue from North America into fewer euros, leading to a 0.4 percent drop in euro-denominated revenues in 2016 and a 0.8 percent drop in 2017. Note how movements that helped Compass in 2016 and 2017 reversed themselves in 2018. Failing to acknowledge these currency movements can lead to a critical misunderstanding of a global company's ability to grow organically.
