# Moving from Enterprise Value to Value per Share

When you have completed the valuation of core operations, as described in Chapter 10, you are ready to estimate enterprise value, equity value, and value per share. Enterprise value represents the value of the entire company, while equity value represents the portion owned by shareholders.

To determine enterprise value, add nonoperating assets to the value of core operations. The most common nonoperating assets are excess cash, investments in nonconsolidated companies, and tax loss carryforwards. To estimate equity value, subtract all nonequity claims from enterprise value. Nonequity claims include short-term and long-term debt, debt equivalents like unfunded pension liabilities, and hybrid securities like convertible securities and employee stock options. Finally, to estimate the intrinsic value per share, divide the resulting equity value by the most recent number of shares outstanding.

While nonoperating assets and nonequity claims may feel like an afterthought, this is not the case. Many sophisticated investors have discovered substantial value hidden in nonoperating assets, especially in privately held conglomerates. In contrast, other investors have been burned by not accurately identifying and valuing all nonequity claims against enterprise value, as happened in the well-publicized case of Enron. It is critical to know who has a claim on cash flow before equity holders do.

This chapter lays out the process for converting core operating value into enterprise value and subsequently into equity value. The chapter goes step-by-step through the process of identifying and valuing the most common nonoperating assets, debt and debt equivalents, hybrid securities, and noncontrolling interests, ending with the final step in valuation—estimating the intrinsic value per share.[2]

# THE VALUATION BUILDUP PROCESS

The valuation buildup begins with a company's core operating value, based on discounted cash flow (DCF)—the top line of the example shown in Exhibit 16.1. This amount plus nonoperating assets equals enterprise value. The equity value—the bottom line in the exhibit—is the value that remains after subtracting from the enterprise value all the nonequity claims, which include interest-bearing debt, debt equivalents, and hybrid claims. We use the term nonequity claim because there are many financial claims against a company's cash flows other than traditional fixed-coupon debt and shareholders' equity.

Estimating the value per share completes the technical aspect of the valuation, yet the job is not complete. It is then time to revisit the valuation with a comprehensive look at its implications. We examine this process in Chapter 17.

In general, a nonoperating asset is any asset that you have not incorporated as part of free cash flow. Common nonoperating assets are excess cash, one-time receivables, investments in nonconsolidated companies (also known as equity investments and by other names), excess pension assets, discontinued operations, and financial subsidiaries. Take extra care not to classify an asset required for ongoing operations as nonoperating. For instance, some analysts who follow retailers add the value of real estate to the value of core operations. Since the real estate is required to conduct business, its benefits are already embedded in the value of operations. The value of real estate can only be added to core operations if the company is charged a market-based rent in free cash flow. Otherwise, including the value of real estate will lead to an overestimate of value.

Nonequity claims are financial claims against enterprise value whose expenses are not included in EBITA and consequently are excluded from free cash flow. Traditional debt contracts like bank debt and corporate bonds are the most common nonequity claims. Other debt-like claims, known as debt equivalents, include the present value of operating leases, unfunded pension and other retirement liabilities, and environmental remediation liabilities, among others. Because these claims do not scale with revenue or can affect the cost of capital, they are best valued separately from free cash flow.

Nonequity claims also include hybrid securities, such as preferred stock, convertible securities, and employee options, which have characteristics of both debt and equity. Such hybrids require special care: their valuations are highly dependent on enterprise value, so you should value them using option-pricing models rather than book value. Finally, if other shareholders have noncontrolling interests against certain consolidated subsidiaries, deduct the value of the noncontrolling interests to determine equity value. Like hybrid securities, noncontrolling interests will correlate with enterprise value, so extra care is required.

# VALUING NONOPERATING ASSETS

Although not included in free cash flow, nonoperating assets still represent value to the shareholder. Thus, to arrive at enterprise value, you must estimate the market value of each nonoperating asset separately and add the resulting value to the DCF value of operations. If necessary, adjust for circumstances that could affect shareholders' ability to capture the full value of these assets. For example, if the company has announced it will sell off a nonoperating asset in the near term, deduct the estimated capital gains taxes (if any) on the asset from its market value. If ownership of the asset is shared with another company, include only your company's portion of the value.

This section identifies the most common nonoperating assets and describes how to handle each of them in the valuation.

# Excess Cash and Marketable Securities

As discussed in Chapter 11, companies often hold more cash and marketable securities than they need to run the business. Companies hold excess cash for a number of reasons, parking it in short-term securities until they can invest it or return it to shareholders. Prior to the change in American tax laws in 2018, American companies held significant amounts of excess cash when they had substantial earnings outside the United States. They were reluctant to repatriate cash because they were required to pay any difference in taxes upon repatriation. With a drop in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, many companies have committed to repatriating cash. How they deploy this cash will unfold over time, but it will probably consist of new investment, increased dividends, and significant share repurchases.[4]

You should make an estimate of how much the business needs for operations. The remaining cash and marketable securities are treated as nonoperating. As a rule of thumb, we often assume that a company requires about 2 percent of revenues in cash to operate the business. The remaining cash and marketable securities are considered excess.

Cash and marketable securities are reported on a company's balance sheet at fair market value. You can use these assets' book value in your valuation, unless you have reason to believe they have significantly changed in value since the reporting date (as in the limited case of volatile equity holdings).

# Investments in Nonconsolidated Companies

Companies often invest in other companies without taking control, and hence they do not consolidate the investment's financial statements into their own. Investments in nonconsolidated companies can be found on the balance sheet under many names. For instance, Philips reports its investments in nonconsolidated companies as investments in associates, Intel reports them as equity investments, and PPG Industries reports them as investment in equity affiliates.

Because the parent company does not have control over these subsidiaries, their financials are not consolidated, so these investments must be valued separately from operations. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), there are two ways in which nonconsolidated subsidiaries can appear in the parent company's accounts:

1. For equity stakes in which the parent company exerts "significant influence" but lacks control (often between 20 and 50 percent ownership), the equity holding in the subsidiary is reported on the parent's balance sheet at the investment's historical cost plus any reinvested income. The parent company's portion of the subsidiary's profits is shown on the parent's income statement as other income, unless specifically disclosed. Accountants refer to this as the equity method.
2. For equity stakes below 20 percent, the parent company is often assumed to have no influence. The equity holdings are shown at historical cost on the parent's balance sheet. The parent's portion of the subsidiary's dividends is included in other income on the income statement.

In response to the accounting and financial scandals of the early 2000s, global accounting moved away from absolute thresholds to consolidation methods that rely on the parent's influence around key activities and exposure to gains and losses. Implementation has been complex, and companies can report under multiple standards. Always investigate the notes to determine which investments contribute to EBITA and which do not.

Investments in Publicly Traded Companies If an investment in another company is publicly listed, use the market value to determine the value of the parent company's equity stake. Verify that the market value is indeed a good indicator of intrinsic value. In some cases, these listed subsidiaries have very limited free float and/or very low liquidity, so the share price may not properly reflect current information.

Exhibit 16.2 presents the equity investments held by Coca-Cola. Since Coca-Cola does not control these companies, their revenue, income, and assets are not consolidated on Coca-Cola's financial statements. Therefore, each investment must be valued separately and added to Coca-Cola's value of operations to determine enterprise value.

In the management discussion and analysis section of its 2018 annual report, Coca-Cola reports both book value and fair value for its equity investments. Therefore, if you are valuing Coca-Cola near its fiscal-year close, the valuation from the annual report will suffice. As the year progresses, however, these data become stale, and each investment must be revalued. For example, consider Coca-Cola Amatil, Coca-Cola's bottler in Australia. To value this

EXHIBIT 16.2 Coca-Cola Company: Publicly Traded Equity Investments, December 2018

The resulting ownership stake equals AU $1,826 million. Since Coca-Cola reports in U.S. dollars, the stake must be converted into U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rate. Multiplying AU $1,826 million by 0.73 equals the value of Coca-Cola's ownership of Coca-Cola Amatil ($1,325 million).

Although this valuation was accurate as of December 31, 2018, any change in one of the inputs will require an update to the valuation. For instance, during the first quarter of 2019, Amatil's stock price rose by approximately 3 percent. This rise in value was reflected in Coca-Cola's next quarterly report but not during the interim.

Investments in Privately Held Companies If the subsidiary is not listed but you have access to its financial statements (for instance, through a public bond offering or private disclosure), perform a separate DCF valuation of the equity stake. Discount the cash flows at the appropriate cost of capital (which may be different than the parent company's weighted average cost of capital). Also, when completing the parent valuation, include only the value of the parent's equity stake and not the subsidiary's entire enterprise value or equity value.

If the parent company's accounts are the only source of financial information for the subsidiary, we suggest the following alternatives to DCF:

- Simplified cash-flow-to-equity valuation. This is a feasible approach when the parent has a 20 to 50 percent equity stake, because the subsidiary's net income and book equity are disclosed in the parent's accounts.

Build forecasts for how the equity-based key value drivers (net income growth and return on equity) will develop, so you can project cash flows to equity. Discount these cash flows at the cost of equity for the subsidiary in question and not at the parent company's cost of capital.

- Multiples valuation. As a second alternative, estimate the partial stake using a price-to-earnings and/or market-to-book multiple. If the company owns 20 to 50 percent of the subsidiary, apply an appropriate multiple to reported income.
- Tracking portfolio. For parent equity stakes below 20 percent, you may have no information beyond the investment's original cost—that is, the book value shown in the parent's balance sheet and often only disclosed in the notes. Even applying a multiple is difficult, because neither net income nor the current book value of equity is reported. If you know when the stake was acquired (or last valued), you can approximate its current market value by applying the relative price change for a portfolio of comparable stocks over the same holding period.

You should triangulate your results as much as possible, given the lack of precision for these valuation approaches.

# Loans to Other Companies

For loans to nonconsolidated subsidiaries and other companies, use the reported book value. This is a reasonable approximation of market value if the loans were given at fair market terms and if the borrower's credit risk and general interest rates have not changed significantly since issuance. If this is not the case and the investment is substantial, you should perform a separate DCF valuation of the promised interest and principal payments at the yield to maturity for corporate bonds with similar risk and maturity.

# Finance Subsidiaries

To make their products more accessible, some companies operate customer financing businesses. Because financial subsidiaries differ greatly from manufacturing and services businesses, it is critical to separate revenues, expenses, and balance sheet accounts associated with the subsidiary from core operations. Failing to do so will distort return on invested capital, free cash flow, and ultimately your perspective on the company's valuation.

Once the finance subsidiary is separated from operations, use the reorganized financial statements to value the subsidiary as if it were a financial institution. Add this value to the value of core operations to determine enterprise value. Since the finance subsidiary's debt will already be incorporated into your valuation of the finance subsidiary, do not subtract total debt from the parent company's enterprise value to determine equity value. Subtract only general obligation debt unrelated to the finance subsidiary.

We present the valuation of a company with a finance subsidiary in Chapter 19, and we cover bank valuation in Chapter 38.

# Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations are businesses being sold or closed. The earnings from discontinued operations are explicitly shown in the income statement, and the associated net asset position is disclosed on the balance sheet. Because discontinued operations are no longer part of a company's operations, their value should not be modeled as part of free cash flow or included in the DCF value of operations. Under U.S. GAAP and IFRS, the assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations are written down to their fair value and disclosed as a net asset on the balance sheet, so the most recent book value is usually a reasonable approximation.[8]

# Excess Real Estate

Excess real estate and other unutilized assets are assets no longer required for the company's operations. As a result, any cash flows that the assets generate are excluded from the free-cash-flow projection, and the assets are not included in the DCF value of operations. Identifying these assets in an outside-in valuation is nearly impossible unless they are specifically disclosed in the company's footnotes. For that reason, only internal valuations are likely to include their value separately as a nonoperating asset. For excess real estate, use the most recent appraisal value when it is available. Alternatively, estimate the real estate value either by using a multiple, such as value per square meter, or by discounting expected future cash flows from rentals at the appropriate cost of capital. Of course, be careful to exclude any operating real estate from these figures, because that value is implicitly included in the free-cash-flow projections and value of operations.

We do not recommend a separate valuation for unutilized operating assets unless they are expected to be sold in the near term. If the financial projections for the company reflect growth, the value of any underutilized assets should instead be captured in lower future capital expenditures.

# Excess Pension Assets

Surpluses in a company's pension funds show up as net pension assets on the balance sheet and typically reported at market value.[9] (Small amounts are typically embedded within other assets.) On an after-tax basis, the pension's value depends on management's plans. If pensions are expected to be dissolved soon, subtract liquidation taxes—typically set higher than the statutory tax rate—from the market value of excess pension assets. Otherwise, subtract taxes at the statutory rate, which reflects the need for lower future contributions. For details on pension accounting and valuation, see Chapter 23.

# Tax Loss Carryforwards

When a company generates a loss in a given year, it can accumulate those losses and net them against future income, thereby reducing future taxes.[10] This is known as a tax loss carryforward. Since tax savings will increase future cash flows, estimate their value using discounted cash flow, and add your result to the company's value of operations.

The potential tax loss carryforward is recorded on the balance sheet as a deferred-tax asset.[11] Use the deferred-tax asset as a starting point to value the tax loss carryforwards. If the company is unlikely to use the tax loss carryforward, the company will record a valuation allowance against the deferred-tax asset. Both numbers can be found in the note on taxes that accompanies the company's financial statements. The company's valuation allowance will reflect its current expectations of future profitability, which may be different from your projections, so use caution in adopting the company's calculation. If you develop multiple scenarios to value operations, estimate your own allowance against the deferred-tax asset based on the probability of the asset being realized under each scenario.

Because tax savings are recorded on an undiscounted basis, apply discounted cash flow to estimate their value as of today. Ideally, you would discount tax savings at a cost of capital that perfectly matches their risk. In practice, use the weighted average cost of capital. This will appropriately counter the value of operating taxes embedded in your value of operations.

To estimate the present value, forecast the year-by-year tax savings based on your projected earnings for the company. Unless income by geography is available, year-by-year tax savings will be difficult to assess because tax loss carryforwards must be matched in the country in which they are generated. A pragmatic approach is to assume the tax benefits will be realized over an arbitrary period—say, five years. If your valuation of tax loss carryforwards affects share price in a meaningful way, ask management for additional disclosures regarding the location and timing of tax credits.

Finally, be careful not to double-count future tax savings by also incorporating them into the projected free cash flow. Since we value tax loss carryforwards separately, the tax loss carryforward is classified as a nonoperating asset and not included as part of either net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) or invested capital.

# VALUING INTEREST-BEARING DEBT

With enterprise value in hand, subtract the value of nonequity claims to determine equity value. Nonequity claims are found in the liability and equity sections of the balance sheet. Nonequity claims include traditional interest-bearing debt, debt equivalents such as unfunded retirement obligations, and hybrid securities that have characteristics of both debt and equity. In this section, we discuss traditional interest-bearing debt.

Traditional debt comes in many forms: commercial paper, notes payable, fixed and floating bank loans, corporate bonds, and capitalized leases. For companies with investment-grade debt, the value of debt will be independent of the value of operations. Consequently, each security's value can be estimated separately. For highly levered companies and companies in distress, this is not the case. In these situations, the value of debt will be linked to value of core operations, and both values must be determined concurrently.

Investment-Grade Debt If the debt is relatively secure and actively traded, use the market value of debt.[12] Market prices for U.S. corporate debt are reported on the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) system.[13] If the debt instrument is not traded, estimate current value by discounting the promised interest payments and the principal repayment at a yield to maturity that reflects the riskiness

12 When a bond's yield is below its coupon rate, the bond will trade above its face value. Intuition dictates that, at most, the bond's face value should be deducted from enterprise value. Yet since enterprise value is computed using the cost of debt (via the weighted average of cost of capital) and not the coupon rate, subtracting face value is inconsistent with how enterprise value is computed. In cases where bonds are callable at face value, market prices will rarely exceed face value.

Developed by FINRA, the TRACE system facilitates the mandatory reporting of over-the-counter market transactions for eligible debt securities in the United States. It is available to the public via FINRA's website. At the time of publication, FINRA provided an online bond search tool on its home page.

of the debt—typically based on the company's bond rating. The book value of debt is a reasonable approximation for fixed-rate debt if interest rates and default risk have not significantly changed since the debt issuance. For floating-rate debt, value is not sensitive to interest rates, and book value is a reasonable approximation if the company's risk of default has been generally stable.

If you are using your valuation model to test changes in operating performance (for instance, a new initiative that will improve operating margins), the value of debt under your new assumptions may differ from its current market value. Always check leverage ratios, such as the interest coverage ratio, to test whether the company's bond rating will change under the new forecasts; often it will not. A change in bond rating can be translated into a new yield to maturity for debt, which in turn will allow you to revalue the debt. For more on debt ratings and interest rates, see Chapter 33.

Highly Levered Companies For companies with significant debt or companies in financial distress, valuing debt requires careful analysis. For distressed companies, the intrinsic value of the debt will be at a significant discount to its book value and will fluctuate with the value of the enterprise. Essentially, the debt has become like equity: its value will depend directly on your estimate for the enterprise value.

To value debt in these situations, apply an integrated-scenario approach. Exhibit 16.3 presents a simple two-scenario example for a company with significant debt. In scenario A, the company's management can implement improvements in operating margin, inventory turns, and so on. In scenario B, changes are unsuccessful, and performance remains at its current level.

For each scenario, estimate the enterprise value conditional on your financial forecasts. $^{14}$  Next, deduct the full value of the debt and other nonequity claims from enterprise value. The full value is not the market value, but rather the value of debt if the company were default free. $^{15}$  If the full value of debt is greater than enterprise value, set the equity value to zero. To complete the valuation, weight each scenario's resulting equity value by its probability of occurrence. For the company in Exhibit 16.3, scenario A leads to an equity valuation of $300 million, whereas the equity value in scenario B is zero. If the probability of each scenario is 50 percent, the value of equity is $150 million.

The scenario valuation approach treats equity like a call option on enterprise value. A more comprehensive model would estimate the entire distribution of potential enterprise values and use an option-pricing model, such as the Black-Scholes model, to value equity.[16] Using an option-pricing model

EXHIBIT 16.3 Valuation of Equity Using Scenario Analysis

<table><tr><td colspan="6">$ million</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Enterprise value</td><td>Face value of debt</td><td>Equity value1</td><td>Probability of occurrence</td><td>Weighted equity value</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Scenario A</td></tr><tr><td>New owner successfully implements value improvements.</td><td>1,500</td><td>1,200</td><td>300</td><td>50\%</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Scenario B</td></tr><tr><td>Company maintains current performance.</td><td>900</td><td>1,200</td><td>-</td><td>50\%</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Equity value:</td><td>150</td></tr></table>

Equity value equals enterprise value less the face value of debt, or zero, whichever is greater.

rather than scenario analysis to value equity, however, has practical drawbacks. First, to model the distribution of enterprise values, you must forecast the expected change and volatility for each source of uncertainty, such as revenue growth and gross margin. This too easily becomes a mechanical exercise that replaces a thoughtful analysis of the underlying economics of potential scenarios. Second, most options models treat each source of uncertainty as independent of the others. This can lead to outcomes that are economically unrealistic. For these reasons, we believe a thoughtful scenario analysis will lead to a better-informed and more accurate valuation than an advanced options model will.

# VALUING DEBT EQUIVALENTS

Debt equivalents have the characteristics of debt but are not formal loan contracts or traded securities. They include operating provisions such as plant decommissioning, nonoperating provisions such as restructuring charges, operating leases, and contingent liabilities such as pending lawsuits. We discuss the most common debt equivalents next.

# Provisions

Certain provisions other than retirement-related liabilities must be deducted as debt equivalents. We distinguish four types of provisions (as introduced in Chapter 11 and discussed in detail in Chapter 21) and value them as follows:

1. Ongoing operating provisions (such as for warranties and product returns) are already accounted for in the free cash flows and therefore should not be deducted from enterprise value.
2. Long-term operating provisions (e.g., plant-decommissioning costs) should be deducted from enterprise value as debt equivalents. Because these provisions cover cash expenses that are payable in the long term, they are recorded at the discounted value in the balance sheet. In this case, there is no need to perform a separate DCF analysis, and you can use the book value of the liability in your valuation.[17]
3. Nonoperating provisions (in cases such as restructuring charges resulting from layoffs) should be deducted from enterprise value as a debt equivalent. Although a discounted value would be ideal, the book value from the balance sheet is often a reasonable approximation. These provisions are recorded on the financial statements at a nondiscounted value, because outlays are usually made in the near term.
4. Income-smoothing provisions should be eliminated from NOPAT. Consequently, they should not be deducted from enterprise value. For an example of income smoothing, see the sale-leaseback example for FedEx presented at the end of Chapter 11.
