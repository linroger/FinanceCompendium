# Nonoperating Items, Provisions, and Reserves

To project free cash flow, you would typically focus on operating expenses, such as cost of sales, distribution expenses, selling expenses, and administrative expenses. But what about nonoperating expenses, such as business realignment expenses, goodwill impairment, and extraordinary items?

Nonoperating expenses are infrequent or unusual charges that are indirectly related to the company's typical activities and not expected to recur. The conventional wisdom is that discounted-cash-flow (DCF) calculations should ignore nonoperating expenses as backward-looking, one-time costs. Yet research shows that the type and accounting treatment of nonoperating expenses can affect future cash flow and in certain situations must be incorporated into your valuation.

This chapter analyzes the most common nonoperating expenses. These include the amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring charges, unusual charges such as litigation expenses, asset write-offs, and goodwill impairments. Since noncash expenses will be accompanied by a corresponding provision, we create a classification system of various provisions and describe the process for reorganizing the income statement and balance sheet to reflect the true effect of such provisions, if any, on company value. We show how to treat provisions in free cash flow and equity valuation.

# NONOPERATING EXPENSES AND ONE-TIME CHARGES

Given their infrequent nature, nonoperating expenses and one-time charges can distort a company's historical financial performance and consequently distort our view of the future. It is therefore critical to separate one-time nonoperating expenses from ongoing operating expenses. The idea sounds simple, but implementing it can be tricky. Nonoperating expenses are often spread across the income statement, and some are hidden within other accounts and can be discovered only by searching the company's notes. Even after you've properly identified nonoperating expenses, the job is not done. Each nonoperating expense must be carefully analyzed to determine its impact on future cash flow, and if necessary, forecasts must be adjusted to reflect any information embedded in the expense.

To assess the impact of nonoperating expenses and incorporate their information in cash flow forecasts, we recommend a three-step process:

1. Separate operating from nonoperating items. This process requires judgment. As a general rule, treat items that grow in line with revenues and are related to running the core business as operating. For line items that are lumpy but only tangentially related to core operations, test the impact of each line item on long-term ROIC.
2. Search the notes for embedded one-time items. Not every one-time charge will be separately disclosed on the income statement. Sometimes the management discussion and analysis section of the annual report will disclose additional information on one-time items.
3. Analyze each nonoperating item for its impact on future operations. Line items not included in earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) will not be included in free cash flow (FCF), so they are not part of core operating value. Therefore, it is critical to analyze each nonoperating line item separately and determine whether the charge is likely to continue in the future, in which case it should be incorporated into FCF projections.

# Separating Operating from Nonoperating Expenses

Many companies include a line item on their income statement that reads "Operating income (loss)" or "Operating profit/loss." For example, in Exhibit 21.1, the income statement for Boston Scientific shows that in 2018 the company reported an operating profit of 1.5 billion. But is this profit an accurate reflection of the company's long-run earnings potential? The accounting definition of operating profit differs from our definition of EBITA, in that the accounting standards for classifying items as nonoperating (i.e., to be recorded below operating profit or loss) are extremely strict. To benchmark core operations effectively, EBITA and net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) should include only items related to the ongoing core business, regardless of their classification by accounting standards.

 As reported in the Boston Scientific 2018 annual report.

Boston Scientific reports several so-called operating expenses that are in fact nonoperating. Amortization of intangibles (599 million in 2018) and intangible-asset impairment charges (35 million) are all noncash reductions in the value of intangible assets; they differ only in their timing and regularity. Other nonoperating expenses include contingent consideration benefit (21 million), restructuring charges (36 million), and litigation-related charges (103 million). For valuation purposes, such nonoperating expenses should not be deducted from revenue to determine EBITA.

The right side of Exhibit 21.1 presents the calculation of EBITA for Boston Scientific. Only operating expenses that grow in line with revenue—such as cost of products sold; selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense; research and development (R&D) expense; and royalty expense—are included in the calculation of EBITA. Note how the accounting definition of operating income grows dramatically, while the growth in EBITA is much more measured.

As noted earlier, judgment is called for in classifying items as operating or nonoperating. Operating expenses tend to be ongoing and tied to revenue, so a long-term perspective is critical. For instance, treat a plant closure that occurs once in ten years as nonoperating. Conversely, for a retailer with hundreds of stores, treat expenses related to closing stores each year as operating.

For Boston Scientific, we classify royalty payments as operating because royalties are a fundamental part of the medical-devices industry and grow in line with revenue. In contrast, litigation expenses are sporadic and come in waves. Exhibit 21.2 presents litigation expenses for Boston Scientific between 2004 and 2018. While litigation expenses have been declining over the last three years, this trend does not capture the long-term levels. We could treat the litigation expenses as operating, but this would depress ROIC during

EXHIBIT 21.2 Boston Scientific: Litigation Expenses by Year periods when the expenses were recognized, rather than in the years when the corresponding benefits were reaped. At the same time, litigation expenses are real, so a valuation of Boston Scientific must incorporate them. Although time-consuming, an analysis of the company's current exposure to litigation and an analysis of average litigation expenses across all medical-technology companies could provide valuable insights.

When classification is unclear, measure ROIC with and without the expense. If the expense is lumpy, smooth the expense over the period in which the expense was generated.

# Searching the Notes for Hidden One-Time Items

The income statement does not explicitly report every nonoperating expense or one-time charge. These can also be embedded in cost of sales or selling expenses. To find embedded expenses, read the management discussion and analysis section in the company's annual report. The section details the changes in cost of sales and other expenses from year to year and will sometimes report unusual items. In 2011, Boston Scientific reported such an expense:

During the first quarter of 2011, we reversed 20 million of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against long-outstanding receivables in Greece. During the first quarter of 2011, the Greek government converted these receivables into bonds, which we were able to monetize, reducing our allowance for doubtful accounts as a credit to selling, general and administrative expenses.

Whether you make an adjustment to NOPAT for such an expense depends on whether the charge is large enough to affect perceptions of performance. If it is not, don't bother. An adjustment could make your analysis overly complex and time-consuming.

# Analyzing Each Nonoperating Item for Impact on Future Operations

In Kimberly-Clark's 2018 annual report, the company writes, "The 2018 Global Restructuring Program will reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. The restructuring is expected to generate annual pre-tax cost savings of  $500 to$ 550 [million] by the end of 2021." If credible, such projections should be incorporated into your forecast of future cash flow.

More broadly, academic researchers have been examining the predictive component of special items and one-time charges. Early research pointed to the low persistence of special items, indicating that they are in fact transitory and should not be incorporated into forecasts. However, this research examined persistence only on a year-to-year basis. In 2009, researchers extended the window to multiple years and found persistence in special items for companies with strong core profits. In other words, a highly profitable company that reports a series of, say, restructuring charges is likely to continue with similar charges in the future. Persistence was low for companies with little operating profit.

One reason special items may persist year after year for profitable companies is that management may be shifting ongoing operating costs into special items to meet certain earnings targets, as many academic researchers believe they do. This belief also appears common among research analysts, as they decrease their earnings forecasts following the disclosure of a special item.[2] Although the research showing that special items are used to manage earnings is persuasive, it remains unclear how to relate the research results to an individual company. Judgment is required: pay close attention to companies disclosing special items. If the special items seem likely to recur, especially in a challenging economy, adjust your forecasts accordingly.

A comprehensive list of nonoperating items and one-time charges is impractical, but the following items are the most common: amortization of acquired intangibles; asset write-offs, including write-offs of goodwill and purchased R&D; restructuring charges; litigation charges; and gains and losses on asset sales. Since each of these nonoperating items requires a particular adjustment, we will work through them one by one.

Amortization of Acquired Intangibles Although accounting standards require amortization of acquired intangibles, in most circumstances you should not deduct amortization from operating profit to determine NOPAT. As an alternative to expensing amortization, use EBITA (not EBIT) to determine operating profits. Since amortization is excluded from operating profit, remember to include the cumulative excluded amortization in your total for intangible assets on the balance sheet. A corresponding entry should be made to equity (titled "cumulative amortization") to balance total funds invested.

Why not amortize intangibles, particularly since we include depreciation in our calculation of ROIC? The idea of recognizing an intangible asset and then amortizing its use over a useful life is a good one. Yet current accounting standards do not allow companies to take this approach consistently across all intangibles. Today, only acquired intangibles are capitalized and amortized, while internally generated intangible assets, such as brand and distribution networks, are expensed when they are created. Thus, the EBIT of a company that acquires an intangible asset and then replenishes the asset through internal investment will be penalized twice on its financial statements, once through SG&A expenses and again through amortization. In fact, expensing the creation of new intangible assets while amortizing old intangibles would be tantamount to including both capital expenditures and depreciation on the income statement, a clearly undesirable characteristic. For valuation purposes, avoid mixing amortization and expensing by maintaining goodwill and acquired intangibles at their original values. To do this, compute operating profit before amortization, and add cumulative amortization to the current value of goodwill and intangible assets.

Exhibit 21.3 demonstrates the effect of amortizing acquired intangibles on margins for three companies in the pharmaceuticals industry. Based on EBIT margin, it appears as if the three companies have nearly identical performance. The amortization of acquired intangibles, however, is distorting our perspective. Pfizer has been extremely active in acquiring companies and

EBITA margin products, including the 2016 purchases of Meditation and Anacor. Stripping out amortization from these and other acquisitions reveals that Pfizer outperformed these peers by roughly seven percentage points.

One situation in which it is appropriate to deduct amortization is when intangibles can be capitalized (versus expensed) consistently. Consider a company that has no sales force and instead purchases customer contacts from a third party. Since sales outlays are never expensed via SG&A, they should be amortized to arrive at a meaningful measure of operating profitability. Otherwise, the income statement would not accurately reflect the cost of selling. Another example is the purchase of frequency rights by telecom companies. Since these assets can be capitalized and amortized without exception, treat them no differently than fixed equipment and depreciation.

AssetWrite-Offs If the value of an asset falls below its book value, accounting standards dictate that the asset should be written down (sometimes entirely) to its fair value. Although write-downs and write-offs give lenders insight into the diminished value of their collateral, the resulting balance sheet value understates the historical investment made by shareholders. Thus, ROIC can artificially rise following a write-down. To counteract this effect, treat asset write-downs and write-offs as nonoperating, and add cumulative write-downs to invested capital. To balance total funds invested, create a corresponding equity equivalent.

Two categories of asset write-offs are common:

1. Asset write-offs. In general, treat an asset write-off as nonoperating. In the rare cases when they occur systematically, treat them as operating. Add back write-downs to the asset, except when you are estimating capital turnover to project future capital needs. In this case, compute the ratio in a manner that best reflects future capital needs.
2. Goodwill and intangibles impairments. Treat goodwill and other intangibles impairments as nonoperating and add back cumulative impairments to goodwill on the balance sheet. Since the purpose of computing ROIC with goodwill is to measure historical performance including all past acquisition premiums, goodwill should remain at its original level.

Restructuring Charges As business changes, companies must adapt. Major changes often require plant closures, employee layoffs, inventory write-downs, asset write-offs, and other restructuring charges. If a restructuring charge is unlikely to recur, treat the charge as nonoperating. If, however, a pattern of ongoing restructuring charges emerges, further analysis is required. Exhibit 21.4 presents the restructuring charges for Boston Scientific between 2009 and 2018. During this period, Boston Scientific's restructuring charges averaged

70 million per year, or 0.9 percent of revenues. These expenses are reported separately from cost of sales and SG&A.

Given their persistence, Boston Scientific's restructuring charges should be analyzed to determine what portion of them represents cash (such as severance payments), whether any cash restructuring charges are likely to continue, and for how long. To this end, a careful reading of the company's notes reveals the following:

In November 2018, the Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a new global restructuring program (the 2019 Restructuring Plan). The 2019 Restructuring Plan is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately  \$200 million to\$ 300 million and reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately \$100 million to \$150 million by the end of 2022 as program benefits are realized.

Many restructuring charges are recorded before any cash is spent. If this is the case, a corresponding reserve will be recorded in the liabilities section of the balance sheet. In the next main section, we consider treatment of various reserves, including those related to restructuring charges.

Litigation Charges When there is likely to be a legal judgment against a company, the company will recognize a litigation charge. If the litigation charge recurs frequently and grows with revenue, treat the charge as operating. For instance, hospital systems frequently defend themselves against malpractice lawsuits. Since these lawsuits are a cost of doing business, the litigation costs should be treated as operating costs for valuation and projected forward. However, if a litigation cost is truly a one-time expense, treat it as nonoperating, and value any claims against the company separately from core operations.

Gains and Losses on Asset Sales When an asset's sale price differs from its book value, the company will recognize a gain or loss. Since current gains and losses are backward-looking (value has been created or destroyed in the past), treat them as nonoperating. Additionally, double-check to make sure projected free cash flow does not incorporate the asset recently sold. For instance, make sure future depreciation reflects only the remaining assets.

Although gains and losses should not be included in operating profit, past asset sales may provide insight about the level of cash to be generated by future asset sales. Again, be careful to value future asset sales (and their corresponding gains and losses) only when the assets are not incorporated in free cash flow. Otherwise, the resulting double-counting will overstate the company's value.

# PROVISIONS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING RESERVES

Provisions are noncash expenses that reflect future costs or expected losses. Companies take provisions by reducing current income and setting up a corresponding reserve as a liability (or deducting the amount from the relevant asset).

For the purpose of analyzing and valuing a company, we categorize provisions into one of four types: ongoing operating provisions, long-term operating provisions, nonoperating provisions like restructuring provisions, or provisions created for the purpose of smoothing income (transferring income from one period to another). Based on the characteristics of each provision, adjust the financial statements to reflect the company's true operating performance. For example, ongoing operating provisions are treated the same way as any other operating expense, whereas restructuring provisions are converted from an accrual to a cash basis and treated as nonoperating. Exhibit 21.5 summarizes the four types of provisions and how to treat them in NOPAT, invested capital, and valuation.

```d2
provisions classification: {
  shape: flowchart
  
  ongoing_operating: "Ongoing Operating Provisions (e.g., warranties, returns)"
  long_term_operating: "Long-Term Operating Provisions (e.g., decommissioning)"
  nonoperating: "Nonoperating Provisions (e.g., restructuring)"
  income_smoothing: "Income-Smoothing Provisions"
  
  ongoing_operating -> nopat: "Deduct from revenue"
  long_term_operating -> nopat: "Deduct operating portion"
  nonoperating -> valuation: "Value separately"
  income_smoothing -> nopat: "Eliminate from NOPAT"
}
```

We believe our classification system of reserves leads to better analysis, but the way you adjust the financial statements should not affect the company's valuation. The valuation depends solely on how and when cash flows through the business, not on accrual-based accounting.

In this example, we reorganize forecast statements, rather than historical statements, to demonstrate how each type of provision would be treated from a valuation perspective. (Historical statements should be adjusted in the same way as forecast statements.) For simplicity, we assume the company pays no taxes and has no debt.

The process for adjusting the financial statements depends on the type of provision. Exhibit 21.7 shows how to reorganize the income statement and balance sheet for each provision for our hypothetical company. In the following discussion of this example, all numbers in parentheses refer to the year 1 reorganized financial statements.

Provisions Related to Ongoing Operations When a company warranties a product, expects that some products will be returned, or self-insures a service, it must create a corresponding liability when that product or service is sold. If the reserve is related to the ongoing operations, the reserve should be treated the same way as other non-interest-bearing liabilities (e.g., accounts payable and wages payable). Specifically, the provision should be deducted from revenues to determine EBITA. The corresponding reserve (100 million) should be netted against operating assets (723.1 million) to measure invested capital (623.1 million). Since the provision and reserve are treated as operating items, they appear as part of free cash flow and should not be valued separately.

Long-Term Operating Provisions Sometimes, when a company decommissions a plant, it must pay for cleanup and other costs. Assume our hypothetical company owns a plant that will operate for ten years and requires  \$200 million in decommissioning costs. Rather than expense the cash outflow in a lump sum at the time of decommissioning, a company will instead record the present value of the cost as both an asset and a liability at the time of investment. In this case, the ten-year present value of\$ 200 million at 10 percent equals \$77.1 million. It's as if the company borrowed \$77.1 million and holds the money in restricted cash to fund the future decommissioning outlay.

Once the decommissioning asset and reserve are recognized, the decommissioning asset is depreciated (similar to the way restricted cash is paid into an outside fund set aside for cleanup), and the reserve is grown (as if the debt accumulates unpaid interest charges). As a result, the decommissioning cost is recognized over the life of the asset, instead of a lump sum at closing.

If the decommissioning costs are substantial, as with a nuclear power plant or a mine, the costs will be presented in the company's footnotes. We show a sample note in Exhibit 21.8. In Panel A of Exhibit 21.8, the decommissioning asset declines by  \$7.7 million each year. This expense is computed using straight-line depreciation on the original decommissioning asset. In Panel B, the decommissioning reserve grows each year by an ever-increasing amount, computed at 10 percent of the prior year's ending reserve. This expense, which mimics interest, is known as accretion. In year 1, the current-year reserve of\$ 150.3 million grows by 15.0 million in accretion. The income statement presented in Exhibit 21.6 reports both depreciation and accretion as operating items, often embedded within depreciation and operating costs, respectively.

To estimate NOPAT, invested capital, ROIC, and FCF, apply the guiding principles presented in Chapter 11. When reorganizing the income statement,

Conversely, since accretion mimics interest, do not include accretion in NOPAT; instead, include it in the reconciliation to net income, next to interest expense. NOPAT and the reconciliation to net income are computed in the top portion of Exhibit 21.7. To reorganize the balance sheet, classify the decommissioning asset (which is comparable to restricted cash) as part of invested capital and the reserve as a debt equivalent. Invested capital and its reconciliation are presented in the bottom half of Exhibit 21.7. To compute free cash flow, start with NOPAT, add back depreciation of the decommissioning asset (since it is noncash), and subtract investments in invested capital. Free cash flow is presented in Exhibit 21.9.

When you treat the plant closure reserve as a debt equivalent, the interest expense and reserve drawdown will not flow through free cash flow. Therefore, subtract the current reported reserve ( \$150.3 million as of today) from the value of operations (\$ 858.9 million) to determine equity value. The value of operations, which includes this and other deductions, is converted into equity value in Exhibit 21.10.

One-Time Restructuring Provisions When management decides to restructure a company, it will often recognize certain future expenses (e.g., severance payments) immediately. We recommend treating one-time provisions as nonoperating and treating the corresponding reserve as a debt equivalent. In year 2, our hypothetical company declared a 30 million restructuring provision, which will be paid in year 3 (see Exhibit 21.6). Since the restructuring is nonoperating, it is not deducted from revenues to determine NOPAT. Rather, it is included in the reconciliation to net income (see Exhibit 21.7). Because we plan to value the provision on a cash basis, the noncash reserve is treated as a debt

Since nonoperating income and expenses do not flow through free cash flow, the restructuring expense must be valued separately on a cash basis. To convert accrual-based restructuring expenses to cash, start with the restructuring expense, and subtract the increase in the restructuring reserve. This leads to a cash-based restructuring provision of  \$0 in year 2 and\$ 30 million in year 3 (free cash flow and its reconciliation are presented in Exhibit 21.9). The present value of the nonoperating cash flow stream equals 22.5 million, which must be deducted from the value of operations to determine equity value, as shown in Exhibit 21.10.

Income-Smoothing Provisions Except for limited circumstances, provisions to smooth earnings are not allowed under International Financial Reporting Standards or U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). To

In some situations, companies can use provisions to smooth earnings. For instance, defense contractors will use income smoothing when they believe a long-term contract's value has changed.

In Exhibit 21.6, our hypothetical company was able to show a smooth growth in reported EBITA and net income by using a smoothing provision. We choose a straightforward title for the account, "Income-smoothing provision," but actual companies typically use subtler wording, such as "Other provisions." For our hypothetical company, a provision was recorded in years 1 and 2 and was reversed in year 3. By using an income-smoothing provision, the company hid its year 3 decline in operating performance (operating costs rose from 75 percent to 85 percent of sales).

To evaluate the company's performance properly, eliminate any income-smoothing provisions. Do this by adding the income-smoothing provision back to reported EBITA (essentially undoing the income-smoothing provision). In this way, we are converting the provision to cash, rather than accounting for it as an accrual, and subsequently need to treat the reserve as an equity equivalent (using a process identical to the one for deferred taxes). Since income-smoothing provisions are entirely noncash, they don't affect free cash flow or valuation.

# Provisions and Taxes

In most situations, provisions are tax deductible only when cash is disbursed, not when the provision is reported. Thus, most provisions will give rise to deferred-tax assets. For example, a  \$30 million noncash restructuring charge would lead to a\$ 30 million restructuring reserve. If the restructuring charge is tax deductible on the GAAP income statement, retained earnings would drop by only \$21 million (assuming a 30 percent tax rate). Since the increase in the restructuring reserve does not match the drop in retained earnings, the balance sheet will not balance. To eliminate the difference, a deferred-tax asset is recognized for \$9 million.

For operating-related provisions, we recommend using cash, rather than accrual taxes. For nonoperating provisions, estimate the tax impact of the corresponding provision. Do not use book values, as they reflect past accounting and not necessarily future cash flow. For an in-depth discussion of deferred taxes, see Chapter 20.

# CLOSING THOUGHTS

The accounting definition of nonoperating expense is narrow and limited to interest expense and a few other items. Therefore, the accounting definition of operating profits will inappropriately include many one-time and other nonoperating items. Always start your financial analysis by separating operating from nonoperating items on the income statement. This will create a better picture of the company's performance and its potential for generating future cash flow. In some cases, the proper classification of a particular expense will be unclear. But don't let this distract you from the task at hand. A proper valuation will not depend on how the item is treated, as long as you include it somewhere and treat it consistently.

# Leases

Many companies, especially retailers and airlines, lease their assets from other companies rather than purchasing the assets outright. They do this for many reasons, including greater flexibility and to lower taxes.

In the past, clever use of accounting rules allowed companies to keep assets and debts off balance sheets. These included leased assets and their corresponding debts, securitized assets like receivables, and unfunded retirement obligations. In some cases, this helped companies manage cash flow or take advantage of alternative routes to raise funds. In other instances, off-balance-sheet items were used to artificially boost results such as earnings per share or return on assets.

In response, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) made significant changes to their guidelines. As of 2019, companies are required to capitalize nearly all asset leases, including operating leases, on their balance sheet. This stands in stark contrast to past guidelines, where a company could rent an asset, even for long periods, and recognize only the periodic rental expense.

The new accounting guidelines bring the treatment of operating leases closer to the underlying principles of this book. Implementation of the new guidelines, however, differs across accounting bodies, so incorporating operating leases into your valuation still requires special care.

This chapter begins with a review of the new accounting rules, how they differ across accounting bodies, and how they are presented on the financial statements. We then outline how to incorporate operating leases into an enterprise valuation. Since operating leases affect each part of the valuation, this chapter provides a review of the valuation principles outlined in Part Two. As companies will not revise their historical financial statements, we discuss how to adjust past financial statements to assure consistent benchmarking over time. The chapter concludes with a discussion of an alternative method for lease valuation, which can be helpful when benchmarking across companies.

# ACCOUNTING FOR OPERATING LEASES

Although both IASB and FASB now require capitalization of operating leases, there are differences in implementing the new standards. For companies that use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), nearly all leases greater than one year are treated as "finance" leases, meaning that leased assets and their corresponding liabilities are capitalized on the balance sheet, and lease expense is appropriately split between depreciation and interest expense. The enterprise valuation methodology outlined in Part Two of this book will correctly incorporate leases under IFRS without further adjustment.

Capitalizing leases under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is more complicated. Companies classify asset leases into either "finance" leases, similar to IFRS, or "operating" leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if cumulative payments to the lessor exceed certain thresholds.[2] Finance leases are not typically visible on the financial statements, as each element is embedded within another financial statement account. The leased asset is included with property, plant, and equipment. The leased liability is included with short-term and long-term debt.

To better understand the impact of the new accounting guidelines, we analyze and value FlightCo, a hypothetical airline that uses operating leases. To avoid the unnecessary complexities of continuing value, we assume the company leases only one aircraft and plans to liquidate at the end of the third year. At that point, parts inventory is sold, general obligation debt is retired, and a liquidating dividend is paid. The lease is classified as an operating lease because the contract length is significantly shorter than the life of the underlying asset.

Exhibit 22.1 presents the valuation of FlightCo's operating lease using discounted cash flow. The lease has payments of  \$9 million,\$ 9 million, and \$12 million in years 1 through 3, respectively. Using discounted cash flow at a cost of debt of 5 percent, the lease has a present value of \$27.1 million. Because the contract life is only three years, the present value of lease payments is significantly lower than the asset's actual value. Later in this chapter, under "An Alternative Method for Valuing Operating Leases," we present a valuation method for estimating the full value of leased assets using data in the annual report. This is helpful when benchmarking two companies that have different financing policies.

Exhibit 22.2 presents the financial statement accounts related to leases for FlightCo and shows how the accounts evolve over time. Although the evolution is neither required for valuation nor disclosed in practice, it will be helpful for explaining the accounting behind leases.

On the income statement, U.S. GAAP requires the total lease payments of  \$30 million to be spread evenly over the life of the contract, even though the cash payments change over time.^{3}$  The annual lease expense is recorded on the income statement at 10 million per year. The lease payment covers the depreciation of the asset, as well as financial compensation for the lessor.

On the balance sheet, the present value of lease payments is recorded as a "right-of-use" asset, and the corresponding liability is recorded as an "operating lease." Both accounts start at 27.1 million—the present value of the lease. While the two accounts will match when initially recorded, they will

1 Under U.S. GAAP, the interest on the operating lease liability is netted against the lease expense to determine the annual reduction in the right-of-use asset.

 Some might think the expense accounting for operating leases mirrors that of finance leases; it does not. In a finance lease, the present value is straight-line amortized over the life of the lease. If FlightCo's lease were a finance lease, amortization expense would equal 9.03 million per year for three years. Lease amortization is included in the depreciation and amortization. Lease interest expense is calculated on the liability and included in interest expense.

not match over time if cash payments vary year to year. That is the case in our FlightCo example. The right-of-use asset will decline  \$8.6 million in the first year (from$ 27.1 to $18.5 million), equal to the lease expense of \$10.0 million less interest of \$1.4 million. (As if this were not confusing enough, interest is calculated on the operating lease liability, not the asset.) In the same year, the operating lease liability declines by \$7.6 million (from $27.1 to $19.5 million), equal to the cash payment of \$9.0 million less the interest of \$1.4 million.

Because of the mismatch described in the previous paragraph, most companies report operating lease liabilities that differ from their corresponding right-of-use assets. Delta Airlines, for example, reported  \$6.0 billion in right-of-use assets in its 10-Q for the first quarter of 2019. In contrast, current maturities of operating leases equal\$ 941 million, and noncurrent operating leases equal \$5.8 billion, totaling \$6.7 billion. In this reporting period, the corresponding values differ by more than 10 percent.

# VALUING A COMPANY WITH OPERATING LEASES

Incorporating operating leases into an enterprise valuation follows the same process outlined in Part Two of this book. We use four steps to value FlightCo:

1. Reorganize the financial statements. During the reorganization, adjust earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) upward by removing the implicit interest in operating lease expense. Adjust operating taxes to determine adjusted net operating profit after tax (NOPAT).
2. Estimate free cash flow (FCF), using adjusted NOPAT and changes in the right-of-use asset. Liabilities classified as operating leases should be treated as debt and incorporated into the reconciliation of free cash flow.
3. Estimate a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) that includes the value of the operating lease liability as debt.
4. Value the enterprise by discounting free cash flow (based on the adjusted NOPAT) at the WACC, including operating leases. Subtract traditional debt and the value of operating lease liability from enterprise value to determine equity value.

As long as you treat right-of-use assets as purchased equipment and treat the operating lease liability as a form of debt, your results will be theoretically consistent. Only operating profit requires an upward adjustment for implicit lease interest. Failing to adjust operating profit will undervalue equity, because implicit interest would be double-counted: once as part of lease expense and again as part of lease value when subtracting the value of leases from enterprise value to get to equity value.

# Reorganizing the Financial Statements

To start the valuation of FlightCo, first reorganize the financial statements. Exhibit 22.3 presents the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of equity for FlightCo.

Using the information from FlightCo's financial statements, Exhibit 22.4 presents a calculation of NOPAT and its reconciliation to net income. The process starts by adding back the implicit interest embedded in the operating lease expense. To estimate implicit interest, multiply the prior year's operating lease liability by the interest rate used to value the operating lease. (If the company does not disclose the discount rate for operating leases in the notes, use the yield to maturity on AA-rated debt.) For FlightCo, embedded interest equals the operating lease liability of 27.1 million multiplied by the interest rate of 5 percent. Estimate implicit interest using the operating lease liability and not the right-of-use asset.

2 Net operating profit after taxes.

To calculate NOPAT, subtract operating taxes from adjusted operating profit. Operating taxes are estimated by multiplying operating profit by the operating tax rate. The resulting NOPAT for year 1 is 21.1 million. The tax shield for embedded interest will be incorporated into the cost of capital.

We do not present a reorganized balance sheet for FlightCo, as the simplified balance sheet already matches invested capital. In general, include the right-of-use asset as part of invested capital and the operating lease liability as a source of financing.

# Estimating Free Cash Flow

Once the financial statements are reorganized, estimate free cash flow. Exhibit 22.5 presents the free cash flow statement and its reconciliation to cash flow to investors for FlightCo. Free cash flow starts with NOPAT. Since FlightCo does not own property or equipment, there is no add-back for depreciation. From this value, subtract increases in working capital (inventory) and long-term assets (in this case, the right-of-use assets). Since both accounts are declining over time, they are positive numbers.

Note in Exhibit 22.5 how the summation of operating lease interest and the decrease in right-of-use assets equal the operating lease expense from Exhibit 22.3. Essentially, the valuation process eliminates the entire lease expense for existing assets from free cash flow. At the completion of the valuation, the lease of existing assets will not be valued as part of free cash flow, but rather as debt. Consistent with fundamental finance principles, this process separates investing flows from the manner in which they are financed.

2Net operating profit after taxes.

When reconciling cash flow to investors, treat embedded interest on operating leases and the change in the operating lease liability as a flow to debt holders. Again, note in Exhibit 22.5 how the summation of these two accounts matches the cash-based lease payment. Financing and its associated taxes should not be part of free cash flow.

# Incorporating Operating Leases into Financial Projections

To forecast right-of-use assets, use the forecasting process introduced in Chapter 13. Link right-of-use assets to sales or a quantity-based measure, such as the number of units sold. In the airline industry, units are represented by number of available seat-miles. Make sure the mix of purchased and leased assets is consistent with the amount of capacity necessary to conduct operations.

Set the operating lease liability as a percentage of the right-of-use asset. While this estimation method is far from precise, flows to and from financing do not affect an enterprise-based valuation. Instead, financing affects valuation only through the target capital structure set in the weighted average cost of capital. If helpful, you can model the combination of operating leases and debt to the target capital structure, but it is not required.

# Estimating the Cost of Capital

To discount free cash flow, use the weighted average cost of capital inclusive of the value of operating leases. Exhibit 22.6 presents the weighted average cost of capital for FlightCo.

We assume the company will maintain its current capital structure of 40 percent adjusted debt to value. Total debt equals the sum of the operating lease liability of  \$27.1 million and traditional debt of\$ 7.8 million, divided by enterprise value, estimated at 87.4 million. When estimating enterprise value, include operating leases as well. For FlightCo, the mix of operating leases and debt will change over time, but we set the combination to be stable at 40 percent of enterprise value. Since operating leases and interest expense are tax deductible, reduce the cost of capital for operating leases and debt by the company's marginal tax rate.

In the calculations for this example, the cost of equity is provided. In practice, the cost of equity must be estimated using beta. Following the principles of Chapter 15, start by estimating an industry unlevered beta. Unlever each company's beta using a debt-to-equity ratio adjusted for operating leases. Next, to determine the target company's beta, relever the unlevered beta to the target company's capital structure, again inclusive of leases.

# Moving from Enterprise Value to Equity Value

To calculate enterprise value, discount free cash flow at the weighted average cost of capital, both inclusive of leases. Exhibit 22.7 shows the enterprise DCF valuation for FlightCo.

Since free cash flow excludes future payments related to existing operating leases, the value of operating leases must be deducted from enterprise value to determine intrinsic equity value. For FlightCo, enterprise value is estimated at  \$87.4 million. Deducting the present value of the operating lease liability (\$ 27.1 million) and debt of \$7.8 million leads to an equity value of \$52.4 million.

# Valuation Using Cash Flow to Equity

In general, we do not recommend a valuation model based on cash flow to equity, because it mixes assets of different risks and commingles operating performance with the capital structure. If implemented properly, however, a cash-flow-to-equity valuation can confirm the accuracy of the enterprise DCF process described in this chapter. It can also provide insight into choices made during the capitalization process.

Exhibit 22.8 presents cash flow to equity for FlightCo. In this exhibit, each line item represents actual cash flowing into or out of the company, from the equity holder's perspective. In the equity model, do not capitalize lease expense. Instead, deduct the cash payments paid to the lessor when they occur. Since leases are expensed and not capitalized, do not include either the change in the right-of-use asset or the change in the operating lease liability. This stands in contrast to debt flows, where both interest expense and payoff of debt are included in the calculation, since they represent actual cash flows.

Exhibit 22.9 values cash flow to equity at the cost of equity. The cost of equity used to discount equity cash flows equals the cost of equity used to determine the weighted average cost of capital. One may think the cost of equity should fall, since the leverage associated with operating leases is being ignored. This is not the case, however. The underlying risk of equity has not changed when switching models, so the cost of equity should not change either.

Discounting cash flow to equity at a 12 percent cost of equity leads to an equity valuation of 52.4 million. This is the same valuation as we calculated by using the enterprise DCF model.

# ADJUSTING HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR OPERATING LEASES

As time progresses, distortions caused by operating leases will be forgotten in the same way most investors have forgotten the adjustments required for the long-defunct pooling of interests prior to 2000. Until then, it is important to recognize that historical financial statements will remain unadjusted. To assure consistency in historical analysis prior to 2019, adjust historical statements to match current accounting policy.

In the analysis of Costco presented in Chapter 11 and Appendix H, we used information from their annual report to value operating leases and adjust the historical financial statements accordingly. Exhibit 22.10 presents the valuation of operating leases for Costco in 2019, the year before Costco adopted the new standard. To value operating leases, we discount future lease payments at the cost of AA-rated debt. Lease commitments are reported in note 5 of Costco's 2019 annual report. The company reports only the first five years of lease payments year by year. Lease payments beyond 2024 are lumped into a single undiscounted number. At the bottom of Exhibit 22.10, we value the lump sum using an annuity formula. In the formula, set the cash

flow equal to the 2024 lease payment. To estimate the number of years, divide the undiscounted lump sum by the 2024 rental payment. For Costco, the annuity value equals almost 1.8 billion. Since the annuity values the lump-sum payments beyond 2024 as of 2024, make sure to discount the result back to 2019, as you would any other cash flow.

In general, when reorganizing the balance sheet, include the value of operating leases as part of invested capital. Incorporate the corresponding liability as a debt equivalent. For past statements, the asset will equal the liability.

In Chapter 11, we adjust Costco's reorganized financial statements for operating leases. Exhibit 11.5 presents invested capital inclusive of operating leases, and Exhibit 11.9 adjusts EBITA and NOPAT for implicit interest. To calculate implicit interest for 2019, multiply the cost of debt of 3.63 percent by the 2018 capitalized operating lease of  \$2.5 billion. The resulting adjustment to EBITA equals\$ 91 million.

# AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR VALUING OPERATING LEASES

To capitalize operating leases on the balance sheet, the company discounts future lease commitments at the company's borrowing rate. For short-term leases, this methodology will understate the actual value of the asset, since it ignores the residual value of the asset being returned to the lessor. Consider FlightCo, which rented an aircraft for three years of the plane's 40-year life. A new aircraft may cost 125 million, but three years of rental expense will be far lower.

While using the present value of lease payments in place of the true asset value will not bias the valuation, it will understate the value of the assets being deployed to run operations. (The error will be largest for short-term leases on long-term assets. In the case of finance leases, the error will be small, since the lease life more closely matches the asset life.) When benchmarking two companies, one that purchases assets and one that rents them, the comparison will not be like-for-like, even under new accounting standards. Distortions to ROIC and capital turnover will be largest when leased assets are a significant proportion of invested capital.

One way to create a like-for-like comparison for companies with different leasing policies is to estimate each company's asset value by using a perpetuity. To see how, let's examine the determinants of rental expense. To compensate the lessor properly, the rental expense includes compensation for the cost of financing the asset (at the cost of secured debt, denoted by  $k_{d}$  in the following equations) and the periodic depreciation of the asset (for which we assume straight-line depreciation). The following equation solves for periodic rental expense:

$$
\text {L e a s e E x p e n s e} _ {t} = \text {A s s e t V a l u e} _ {t - 1} \left(k _ {d} + \frac {1}{\text {A s s e t L i f e}}\right) \tag {22.1}
$$

To estimate the asset's value, rearrange equation 22.1 as follows:

$$
\text {A s s e t V a l u e} _ {t - 1} = \frac {\text {L e a s e E x p e n s e} _ {t}}{\left(k _ {d} + \frac {1}{\text {A s s e t L i f e}}\right)} \tag {22.1}
$$

Lease expense is disclosed in the notes, and the cost of debt can be estimated using AA-rated yields. This leaves only the asset life, which is often unreported. If this is the case, search the notes for the type of asset being leased, and estimate an asset life appropriate to the asset type. As an alternative, Lim, Mann, and Mihov propose using property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) divided by annual depreciation.[7] In their research, they examined 7,000 firms over 20 years and computed the median asset life at 10.9 years.

In this section, we focus on the distortions to benchmarking caused by different leasing policies. Companies choose different leasing policies for many reasons, including flexibility and taxes.

# CLOSING THOUGHTS

Recent changes in lease accounting have brought financial reporting very close to the core principles of this book. Still, a proper valuation requires special care regarding operating leases. To inform better forecasts, adjust statements created prior to the accounting rules changes to incorporate operating leases. If you do not, apples-to-oranges comparisons may obscure crucial trends. For statements reported after the changes, remember to eliminate any interest embedded in operating expenses. Otherwise, you risk double-counting embedded interest, biasing your valuation downward. The task requires discipline and attention to detail, but with practice, the adjustments should become routine.

# Retirement Obligations

To attract and retain talent, companies often offer retirement benefits to employees. These benefits include fixed pension payments, tax-advantaged savings plans, and promises to provide medical benefits when the employee retires. In some countries, companies are required to set up separate funds to pay these benefits, but inconsistencies are common because of differences in regulations and tax policy. For example, in the United States, companies must set up separate funds for pension promises (known as defined-benefit plans) but not for promises of retiree medical benefits. If the value of investments does not fully fund future promises, the company will have unfunded retirement obligations. Since the company is responsible for any shortfalls and these obligations take precedence over equity, any accurate valuation must account for them.

This chapter explores how to analyze and value a company with pension and other retirement obligations. Recent accounting changes have made the analysis easier, but careful thinking and reorganizing of financial statements are still required. The challenges include deciding which part of the pension expense is operating versus nonoperating, treating the balance sheet for unfunded or overfunded obligations, estimating the cost of capital for companies with pensions, and adjusting equity value to reflect unfunded (or overfunded) retirement obligations.

# REORGANIZING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH PENSIONS

In the past, accounting for pensions and other retirement obligations severely distorted operating profit, requiring adjustments to correctly measure the impact of retirement obligations on the company's value. In response, accounting policy has changed, gradually bringing the accounting for retirement obligations in line with the underlying doctrines of this text.

For companies that report under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the changes occurred over many decades. Under original accounting principles, companies did not recognize unfunded pension liabilities on their balance sheets. The first changes involved recording unfunded retirement liabilities, albeit at a smoothed value intended to address the effects of short-term irregularities. In the 1980s, the rules were updated, and companies were required to record not only unfunded pension liabilities, but also other postretirement obligations, particularly promised medical benefits. Starting in 2006, companies were required to recognize the actual value of the unfunded (or overfunded) pension liability on the balance sheet.[1]

Although the balance sheet reflected the value of unfunded pension liabilities after 2006, the pension expense continued to include both operating and nonoperating items. It included not only new benefits granted to employees, but also interest on the liability, returns on plan assets, and adjustments for actuarial changes. In 2018, nonoperating items were removed from pension expense. (This change mirrored adjustments we'd recommended in earlier editions of this book.) Any new benefits granted to employees are now included in the appropriate operating expense, such as cost of sales or selling expenses. All other items, such as interest expense, actuarial changes, and earnings, are classified as "other" expense.

Because of these changes, you no longer need to make as many adjustments to the GAAP financial statements for pensions and retirement benefits for 2018 and forward. You must still adjust financial statements released before 2018. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) have been updated as well, but under multiple revisions to existing standards, rather than by adopting an entirely new standard.

Throughout the chapter, we examine pension accounting using the American food manufacturer Kellogg. Kellogg is an interesting case because, even though its pension obligations are almost fully funded (about  $95\%$ , which is within the margin of year-to-year fluctuations), it's still necessary to dive into the details to make the right adjustments to estimate net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) and invested capital. The information required to analyze pensions for Kellogg is in the footnotes to their financial statements, note 10, "Pension Benefits," and note 11, "Nonpension Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits."2 In these two notes, the company provides information on projected benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and a breakout of the annual pension expense.

# Reorganizing the Balance Sheet

To start, find all the retirement-related assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. If these items are relatively small, companies may include prepaid pension

assets in other long-term assets and unfunded pension liabilities as part of other long-term liabilities, but the details will be in the pension footnote.

Exhibit 23.1 reports the funded status of Kellogg's defined-benefit plans and the location of the company's underfunding on the balance sheet, as reported in the notes. In 2018, Kellogg had  \$369 million in unfunded pension and other postretirement liabilities. This amount does not appear as a single value on the balance sheet. Instead, the net underfunding is disaggregated across four accounts, including\$ 335 million embedded in other assets, \$19 million embedded in other current liabilities, a pension liability of \$651 million, and 34 million embedded in other liabilities. A company can have both excess pension assets and unfunded pension liabilities, because companies may have multiple pension plans, and pension assets from one plan are not netted against underfunding from another.

Note that most companies don't fund their "other" retirement obligations, like promised medical benefits, so this will typically appear as showing zero assets and only the liability.

When reorganizing the balance sheet, separate operating assets from pension assets, and treat excess pension assets as nonoperating. Unfunded pension liabilities (on a gross basis) should be treated as a debt equivalent and, as such, should not be deducted from operating assets to determine invested capital. Instead, they will be valued separately during the transition from enterprise value to equity value.

# Reorganizing the Income Statement

Pension accounting combines several items into a single expense, known as the pension expense. Some components are operating, while others are related to the performance of the plan assets. As such, pension expense must be

In Exhibit 23.2, you will find six accounts. Service cost and the amortization of prior service cost represent benefits granted to the employee in return for service to the company. Interest cost on plan liabilities, expected return on plan assets, and recognized gains and losses represent the evolution of plan assets and liabilities over time. If the change in plan assets matched the change in plan liabilities each year, these accounts would cancel. Since markets are volatile, this is not the case. As a result, the investment performance of plan assets contaminates pension expense. Curtailments represent changes to the pension plan that restrict benefits.

Prior to 2018, companies using GAAP reported the entire pension expense as part of operating expenses. Although not visible on the income statement, the expense was subtly embedded in cost of sales and in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses. This meant operating expenses and consequently operating profit were a function of the investment performance of plan assets, leading to distortions in competitive benchmarking.

To better understand potential distortions, examine the portion of pension expense titled "recognized net (gain) loss" in Exhibit 23.2. In 2016, Kellogg recognized  \$304 million in losses on plan assets. This increased pension expense relative to other years. In 2017, Kellogg reported recognized gains of\$ 126 million. This caused pension expense to convert from a \$199 million expense in 2016 to a \$431 million benefit in 2017. Since pension expense is embedded within cost of sales, this caused

Service cost represents the present value of retirement promises given to the company's employees in a particular year. Prior service costs are additional retroactive benefits given to employees from an amendment to the pension plan. Prior service costs are not expensed immediately. Instead, they are amortized over the expected lifetimes of employees. For more on pension accounting, see D. Kieso, J. Weygandt, and T. Warfield, *Intermediate Accounting*, 17th ed. (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2019), chap. 20.

4 Interest cost represents the present value of service cost growing into the actual retiree payout. Expected return on plan assets equals the expected return based on asset mix. Recognized gains and losses represent the gradual recognition of past gains and losses of the pension fund.

Source: Kellog 2016-2018 annual reports.

To eliminate plan performance from past operating expenses, remove the pension expense—in Kellogg's case, a  \$431 million gain in 2017—and replace it with the service cost of\$ 114 million. These adjustments are shown in the middle section of Exhibit 23.3. If benchmarking across companies, one can also include the amortization of prior service costs as an operating expense. While these prior service costs represent real benefits given to employees, they are noncash and represent past changes. Therefore, they should not be incorporated into free cash flow. These service costs are also often small and unlikely to change our perception of historical performance; for simplicity's sake we usually treat them as non-operating.

Under new accounting standards, the pension expense is no longer treated as operating. Instead, service cost is allocated to the appropriate operating expense account (cost of goods sold or SG&A), and the nonoperating portion of pension expense is treated as "other income or expenses," as is the case for Kellogg in 2018. Since other income or expenses usually accumulates nonoperating items, this makes reorganizing simple.

Given that accounting guidelines across countries may differ, always check the notes for the location of various elements and adjust accordingly.

# Expected Return and Earnings Manipulation

To avoid volatility in the income statement, accounting standards allow companies to include an "expected return" on pension plan assets as part of pension expense, rather than actual returns. For example, Exhibit 23.2 shows that Kellogg recorded 455 million in expected return on plan assets in 2018, even

though the plan assets lost 350 million that same year. This enables companies to smooth pension returns from year to year, avoiding volatility in net income.

Since expected return must be estimated, company management has discretion over the rate used—a license that management may sometimes use to manipulate accounting profitability. Bergstresser, Desai, and Rauh found that management increases expected rates of return to increase profitability immediately before acquiring other firms and before exercising stock options. They also found that companies with the weakest shareholder protections tend to use the highest estimates for expected return. With nonoperating items now incorporated into other income and expenses, cost of sales and operating profit are no longer affected by expected-return choices. Even so, net income remains susceptible, which is just one of many reasons why NOPAT, and not earnings per share (EPS), remains a critical measure of accurate benchmarking and financial forecasting.

# PENSIONS AND THE COST OF CAPITAL

A key component of valuation is the cost of equity, which is typically estimated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and beta. As discussed in Chapter 15, it is difficult to accurately measure the beta of a single company. Therefore, we recommend using an industry beta derived from multiple companies in similar lines of business.

To isolate the economic risk each company faces, it is important to remove the effect of leverage and, if meaningful, the effect of pensions from beta. In Exhibit 23.4, we present the pension details, debt, and equity of three consumer products companies, including Kellogg. The data include pension plans and other retiree benefits, such as health care. Each company's plan is well funded, with pension shortfalls at or below 10 percent of projected benefit obligations.

There are two ways to incorporate pensions into the unlevering process. In the first method, we assume the pension fund manager has successfully matched the beta risk of plan assets to the beta risk of projected benefits. In this case, the funded portion will net out, and only the unfunded portion will affect the equity beta. In the second method, we relax the assumption of matched beta. While the second method is more flexible than the first, it requires an estimate of the beta risk for plan assets. Since the estimate requires data found only in the notes (versus a professional data provider), as well as a few assumptions regarding asset composition, its use should be limited to situations where pensions play a critical role in company valuation.

In the first method, we assume that only the unfunded pension liability affects the equity beta. Since the unfunded pension liability mirrors debt, we can use the equation for unlevering beta presented in Chapter 15:

$$ b _ {u} = \frac {D}{V} b _ {d} + \frac {E}{V} b _ {e} \tag {1}
$$ where  $b_{\mathrm{u}}$  equals the unlevered beta,  $b_{\mathrm{d}}$  equals the beta of debt,  $b_{\mathrm{e}}$  equals the beta of equity, and  $E$  equals the market value of equity. The unfunded pension liability is a debt equivalent. Therefore,  $D$  equals traditional debt plus unfunded pension liabilities less excess cash.


In Exhibit 23.5, we estimate the unlevered beta for Kellogg and two other companies. We present the results with and without pensions for the purpose of comparison. In the analysis, we assume a debt beta of 0.17. Many assume that the debt beta equals zero, but we use a positive beta to assess the various methodologies in a consistent manner.

ratio equals 31.8 percent without unfunded pensions and 32.6 percent with unfunded pensions. The resulting unlevered betas with and without unfunded pensions are nearly identical because Kellogg's unfunded pension of  \$369 million is quite small compared with its debt of\$ 9.2 billion. Not surprisingly, the equity beta is higher than the unlevered beta, because leverage increases risk.

To unlever beta when the risk is mismatched, we separate plan assets from pension liabilities and apply the teachings of economists Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller (see Chapter 10) to solve for the risk of operating assets. In Appendix C, we step through the algebraic derivation, leading to the following formula for unlevered beta:

$$ b _ {u} = \frac {D + V _ {p b o}}{V} b _ {d} + \frac {E}{V} b _ {e} - \frac {V _ {p a}}{V} b _ {p a} \tag {2}
$$ where  $b_{u}$  represents unlevered beta,  $b_{d}$  represents the beta of debt,  $b_{e}$  represents the equity beta,  $b_{pa}$  represents the beta of plan assets,  $D$  equals the value of traditional debt net cash,  $V_{pbo}$  equals the projected benefit obligations,  $E$  equals the market value of equity,  $V_{pa}$  equals the market value of plan assets, and  $V$  equals enterprise value, as measured by the sum of debt, unfunded pension liabilities, and the market value of equity.


To measure the beta of plan assets, we use the target allocation reported in the pension footnote. Following the research of Jin, Merton, and Bodie, we assume debt securities have a beta of 0.17 and other investments have a beta of  $1.0$ . Using the data from Exhibit 23.4 and Exhibit 23.5, we solve for unlevered beta. For Kellogg, the resulting unlevered beta equals 0.39. Because the beta of plan assets exceeds that of projected benefits, the resulting estimate of unlevered beta is lower than we obtained using earlier methods. Had the betas for plan assets and plan liabilities been the same, the two methods would yield the same results.

While each method has its benefits, we believe Equation 1 inclusive of unfunded pension liabilities is the easiest and most reliable method for unlevering beta. An estimate of unfunded pension liabilities is already required for equity valuation, and the method does not require an extensive analysis of plan assets—a daunting task when there are many companies to analyze within an industry.

# RELEVERING BETA TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF EQUITY

Once you have estimated the unlevered industry beta, relever the industry beta to the company's target capital structure and compute the company's cost of capital. To relever the industry beta, do not incorporate pensions. While this may seem inconsistent for a company with pensions, it is not. We have eliminated pensions from free cash flow and the cost of capital, and there is no reason to reintroduce pensions, or the risk associated with them, into the value of operations. Instead, value pensions separately, and sum the parts.


# INCORPORATING PENSIONS INTO THE VALUE OF EQUITY

Pension plans and other obligations, such as promised medical benefits, will affect a company's value in two ways. First, service cost will be embedded within free cash flow. Since only cash contributions and not service costs are tax deductible, make sure to adjust taxes appropriately for companies that systematically underfund their obligations. Not every country provides tax relief on pension contributions, so check local tax law to determine the marginal tax rate for contributions. Second, past over- or underfunding must be incorporated into value as a nonoperating asset or debt equivalent.

For an ongoing enterprise, excess pension assets can be netted against unfunded liabilities to determine net assets (or liabilities) outstanding. If the company is being valued for liquidation or the pension plan is being terminated, net unfunded liabilities cannot be netted against excess pension assets, as most countries charge a significant penalty for withdrawing excess funds from pension plans. Instead, add after-tax excess pension assets at the penalty rate, and deduct after-tax unfunded pension liabilities at the marginal tax savings for pension contributions.

To value companies with net unfunded liabilities, reduce enterprise value by the product of (1 - marginal tax rate) times net pension liabilities. To incorporate pensions for a company with net excess assets, increase enterprise value by the product of (1 - marginal tax rate on pensions) times net pension assets, as excess pension assets will lead to fewer required contributions in the future.

In 2018, Kellogg recognized  \$440 million in unfunded pension liabilities and\$ 71 million in prefunded other benefits (see Exhibit 23.1), for a net total liability of \$369 million. Assuming a marginal tax rate of 24 percent, the after-tax liability equals \$280 million. To determine equity value, deduct the after-tax liability from enterprise value.

# CLOSING THOUGHTS

The International Accounting Standards Board and the U.S.-based Financial Accounting Standards Board have worked to eliminate the distortions caused by pension accounting. For most companies, the income statement now separates service cost from nonoperating pension expenses, and the balance sheet recognizes the market value of unfunded pension obligations. The result is better benchmarking, requiring fewer adjustments, and a valuation that is easier to carry out.
