# Chapter 22 - Leases

Starting in 2019, companies are required to recognize nearly all leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet. For companies that report using IFRS, lease-related interest is recorded as a financial expense, and lease-related liabilities are incorporated within debt. Therefore, no adjustment is required.

For companies that report using U.S. GAAP, there are two types of leases: finance leases and operating leases. The treatment of finance leases is identical to IFRS, so no adjustment to enterprise value is required. In contrast, operating leases require special care. To determine equity value, remove embedded interest from operating expense, include the year-to-year change in "right-to-use" assets in free cash flow, and deduct the operating-lease liability from enterprise value to determine equity value.[18] To value equity consistently, all three actions are required. If you choose not to adjust for embedded interest or include the change of "right-to-use" assets on free cash flow, do not subtract the value of operating leases.

Chapter 22 details the new accounting rules, required adjustments, and valuation of leases.

## Convertible Securities

Convertible bonds are corporate bonds that can be exchanged for common equity at a predetermined conversion ratio.[19] Convertible preferred stock has the same basic structure as convertible bonds, except convertible stock often comes with other rights of control, such as board seats. Both have become a major source of financing for publicly traded technology companies.[20] A convertible bond is essentially a package of a straight corporate bond plus a call option on equity (the conversion option). Because the conversion option can have significant value, this form of debt requires treatment different from that of regular corporate debt.

The value of convertibles depends on the enterprise value. In contrast to valuation of straight debt, neither the book value nor the simple DCF value of bond cash flows is a good proxy for calculating the value of convertibles. Depending on the information available, there are four possible methods to apply:

1. Fair value. Companies report the "fair" value of financial instruments, including convertible debt, in the notes to the financial statements. Companies value these investments using quoted market prices or pricing models, and they disclose the methodology used. Use this value if enterprise value has not changed significantly since the last financial report.
2. Market price. Many convertible bonds are actively traded with quoted prices. For U.S. convertible debt, use the TRACE database to determine the market value of debt when the enterprise value has materially changed since the last filing.
3. Black-Scholes value. When the fair value or market value is inappropriate,[21] we recommend using an option-based valuation for convertible debt. Accurate valuation of convertible bonds with option-based models is not straightforward. That said, by following methods outlined by DeSpiegeleer, Van Hulle, and Schoutens, you can make a reasonable approximation applying an adjusted Black-Scholes option-pricing model.[22]
4. Conversion value. The conversion value approach assumes that all convertible bonds are immediately exchanged for equity and ignores the time value of the conversion option. It leads to reasonable results when the conversion option is deep in the money, meaning the bond is more valuable when converted into equity than when held for future coupon and principal payments.

Valuing Convertibles Exhibit 16.4 illustrates all four valuation methods for the mobile-payments company Square. Square has not issued traditional, fixed-payment debt. Instead, the company issued two convertible bonds: a  \$211.7 million convertible bond due in March 2022 and an\$ 862.5 million convertible bond due in May 2023.[23] Because the coupon rate was below the prevailing yield for nonconvertible debt at the time of offering, the bonds are reported on the balance sheet below their principal value, at  \$181.2 million and\$ 718.5 million, respectively.[24]

The first column in Exhibit 16.4 values Square's equity using the fair value of convertible debt reported in the company's 10-K. The second column presents the year-end closing price collected from the TRACE database. Compared with the book value reported on the balance sheet, the company's convertible debt trades at a significant premium. For instance, the convertible debt due in 2023 was valued by Square at  \$901.5 million in December 2018 versus\$ 718.5 million in book value.

The significant premium to book value can be traced to the value of the conversion feature. According to Square's annual report, the bonds maturing in 2022 are convertible at  \$22.95 per share.[25] At this conversion price,\$ 211.7 million in outstanding principal is convertible into 9.23 million shares. With Square's stock trading at \$56.09 in December 2018, the bonds can be converted into the equivalent of \$517.5 million in equity. The bond trades at a market price (\$523.2 million), which is slightly higher than the bond's conversion value (\$517.5 million), given the upside potential and downside protection the bond offers.

24 When a company issues convertible debt at a coupon rate below the yield on similar nonconvertible debt, it will be recorded on the balance sheet at a discount but may not trade at a discount. This is because the conversion feature has value. The value of the conversion feature, however, is not recorded as part of debt, but rather as shareholders' equity. Since the book value of equity is not used in DCF valuation, this can lead to a significant underestimation of the convertible's value. For more on the accounting related to convertible debt, see Accounting Principles Board (APB) 14-1, "Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)." Financial Accounting Standards Board, May 9, 2008, www.fasb.org.

25 Reported in Square's 2018 annual report, note 12, "Indebtedness."

If improvements to operations increase enterprise value, it becomes necessary to revalue Square's convertibles using an option-pricing model. To model the value of Square's convertible debt, disaggregate the value of convertible debt into underlying straight debt and the option value to convert. For the bond maturing in 2022, the value of straight debt equals the net present value of a 0.375 percent coupon bond yielding 2.48 percent (the yield on comparable bonds without conversion features), maturing in 3.25 years (the remaining life). Without conversion, this bond is valued at 93.45 percent of  \$211.7 million in outstanding principal, or\$ 197.9 million.

To determine the option to convert's value, you need six inputs: the underlying asset value, the strike price, the volatility of the underlying asset, the risk-free rate, the time to maturity, and the dividend rate on the underlying asset. For the option embedded in Square's 2022 convertible bond, the underlying asset is 9.23 million shares of Square stock, whose current value equals  \$517.5 million. The strike price, which represents what the investor must pay to receive the shares, equals the current value of straight debt, currently valued at\$ 197.9 million. The volatility of Square shares (30.9 percent) is reported in the company's 10-K. The bond's time to maturity is 3.25 years, and the current risk-free rate is 2.48 percent.[26] Square does not pay dividends, so the dividend yield is set at zero.

Plugging the data into a Black-Scholes estimator leads to an option value of  \$336.9 million. Thus, as illustrated in the third data column of Exhibit 16.4, the Black-Scholes value of the convertible debt equals\$ 534.8 million (\$197.9 in straight debt plus \$336.9 in option value). This result is contingent on stability of the Black-Scholes inputs, especially volatility. If volatility is expected to drop as the company matures, the historical estimate of volatility will overestimate the option value. The errant valuation is largest for long-dated options, which is often the case for convertible debt.

An alternative to option pricing is the conversion value approach, shown in the fourth data column of Exhibit 16.4. The method is easier to implement than Black-Scholes but ignores optionality. Under the conversion value approach, convertible bonds are converted immediately into equity. Since Square's bonds are convertible into 20.3 million shares (9.2 million shares from the convertible debt due in 2022 and 11.1 million shares from the convertible debt due in 2023), nondiluted shares are increased from 419.7 million to 440.0 million. This approach zeroes out convertible debt and divides the equity value by diluted shares.

In this case, each approach leads to a similar value because the value of conversion is much higher than the value of traditional debt (known as being in the money). For bonds out of the money, the conversion approach will lead to an underestimation of the bonds' value. Therefore, we recommend using an option valuation model, such as Black-Scholes.

Convertible Bond Hedges When a company issues a convertible bond, the bond is sometimes accompanied by a complex derivative transaction to effectively increase the strike price.[27] For example, Square, Etsy, and Twitter have all issued convertible debt with accompanying hedges. Investors prefer strike prices close to the current share price. Issuers, concerned about dilution from conversion into equity, prefer a higher strike price that lowers the odds of conversion.

In its annual report, Square reports, "The Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions … to effectively increase the overall conversion price from approximately  \$22.95 per share to approximately\$ 31.18 per share." To account for the value of the hedge, we use Black-Scholes to revalue the convertible bond at the higher strike price. The convertible note hedge reported in Exhibit 16.4 equals the difference between the original and synthetic bond price.

Although Square does not report the value of the hedge on the balance sheet or in the notes, the company does disclose that "the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of our Class A common stock." Even with the recent improvements in accounting transparency, a diligent analysis of the notes continues to be critical!

## Employee Stock Options

## Noncontrolling Interests by Other Companies

## ESTIMATING VALUE PER SHARE

The final step in a valuation is to calculate the value per share. Assuming that you have used an option-based valuation approach for convertible bonds and employee options, divide the total equity value by the number of undiluted shares outstanding. Use the undiluted (rather than diluted) number of shares because the full values of convertible debt and stock options have already been deducted from the enterprise value as nonequity claims. Also, use the most recent number of undiluted shares outstanding. Do not use the weighted average of shares outstanding; it is reported in the financial statements to determine average earnings per share.

The number of shares outstanding is the gross number of shares issued, less the number of shares held in treasury. Most U.S. and European companies report the number of shares issued and those held in treasury under shareholders' equity. However, some companies report treasury shares as an investment asset, which is incorrect from an economic perspective. Treat them instead as a reduction in the number of shares outstanding.

If you used the conversion and exercise value approach to account for employee options and convertible debt and stock options, divide by the diluted number of shares.

With intrinsic value per share in hand, you have completed the mechanics of your valuation. But the job is not done. The next two chapters discuss how to stress-test your valuation using integrated scenarios and trading multiples.
