# Mergers and Acquisitions

Growth through acquisition may have very different effects on value creation than internal growth does because of the sizable premiums a company must pay to acquire another company. Therefore, it is important to understand how companies have been generating historical revenue growth: through organic means or through acquisition.

Many large companies provide data tables such as the ones for Compass and Sodexo in Exhibit 12.7. Without voluntary disclosure, stripping the effect of acquisitions from reported revenues can be difficult. Unless an acquisition is deemed material by the company's accountants, company filings do not need to detail or even report the acquisition. For larger acquisitions, a company will report pro forma statements that recast historical financials as though the acquisition were completed at the beginning of the fiscal year. Organic revenue growth, then, should be calculated using the pro forma revenue numbers. If the target company publicly reports

1 Only consolidated revenues are reported in a company's annual report.

its own financial data, you can construct pro forma statements manually by combining revenue of the acquirer and target for the prior year. But beware: the bidder will include partial-year revenues from the target for the period after the acquisition is completed. To remain consistent from year to year, reconstructed prior years also must include only partial-year revenue.

Exhibit 12.8 presents the hypothetical purchase of a target company in the seventh month of year 3. Both the parent company and the target are growing organically at 10 percent per year. Whereas the individual companies are growing organically at 10 percent, consolidated revenue growth is reported at 22.8 percent in year 3 and 18.2 percent in year 4.

To create an internally consistent comparison for years 3 and 4, adjust the prior year's consolidated revenues to match the current year's composition. To do this, add seven months of the target's year 2 revenue (7/12 × $22 million = $12.8 million) to the parent's year 2 revenue ($110.0 million). This leads to adjusted year 2 revenues of $122.8 million, which matches the composition of year 3. To compute an organic growth rate, divide year 3 revenues ($135.1 million) by adjusted year 2 revenues ($122.8 million) to get the correct 10 percent organic growth of the two companies.

Even though the acquisition occurs in year 3, the revenue growth rate for year 4 also will be affected by the acquisition. Year 4 contains a full year of revenues from the target. Therefore, to estimate year 4 organic growth, you must increase year 3 revenue by five months of target revenue (5/12 × $24.2 million = $10.1 million).

# Accounting Changes and Irregularities

Each year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) make recommendations concerning the financial treatment of certain business transactions through either formal standards or topic notes issued by assigned task forces. Changes in a company's revenue recognition policy can significantly affect revenues during the year of adoption, distorting the one-year growth rate. You therefore need to eliminate their effects in order to understand real historical revenue trends.

Consider the new revenue recognition standards that replaced existing IFRS and GAAP revenue rules in 2017. These standards introduced a requirement that companies follow a five-step process to determine the allocation of revenue over the life of a contract, implied or written. In some cases, initiating this process caused revenues to be delayed to later in the contract, causing a one-time drop in like-for-like revenues. For example, automobile companies that provide free maintenance saw a one-time drop as revenues were delayed. Other industries, including cell phone providers, experienced a one-time increase in revenue as cell phone equipment sales can now be recognized immediately, rather than over the life of the contract.

If an accounting change is material, a company will document the change in its section on management discussion and analysis (MD&A). For instance, as shown in Exhibit 12.7, Sodexo specifically called attention to an unusual 53-week year in 2017. The longer time period in 2017 artificially raised 2017 growth rates while lowering 2018 growth rates.

# Decomposing Revenue Growth to Develop an Integrated Perspective of Growth Drivers

Once you have removed the effects of mergers and acquisitions, currency translations, and accounting changes from the year-to-year revenue growth numbers, analyze organic revenue growth from an operational perspective. The most standard breakdown is:

$$
\text {R e v e n u e s} = \frac {\text {R e v e n u e s}}{\text {U n i t s}} \times \text {U n i t s}
$$

Using this formula, determine whether prices or quantities are driving growth. Do not, however, confuse revenue per unit with price; they can be different. If revenue per unit is rising, the change could be due to rising prices, or the company could be shifting its product mix from low-price to high-price items.

The operating statistics that companies choose to report (if any) depend on the industry's norms and competitors' practices. For instance, most retailers provide information on the number of stores they operate, the number of square feet in those stores, and the number of transactions they conduct annually. By relating different operating statistics to total revenues, it is possible to build a deeper understanding of the business.

Consider this retailing standard:

$$
\text {R e v e n u e s} = \frac {\text {R e v e n u e s}}{\text {S t o r e s}} \times \text {S t o r e s}
$$

Exhibit 12.9 reports disguised operating statistics for two big-box retailers we'll call Delta and Gamma. Using the operating statistics reported in Exhibit 12.9, we discover that Delta has more stores than Gamma and generates more revenue per store ( $47 million per store for Delta in 2018 versus$ 37 million for Gamma). Using the three operating statistics, it is possible to build ratios on revenues per store, transactions per store, square feet per store, dollars per transaction, and number of transactions per square foot.

Although operating ratios are powerful in their own right, what can really change one's thinking about performance is how the ratios change over time. Exhibit 12.10 organizes each ratio based on Exhibit 12.9 into a tree. Rather than report a calculated ratio, such as revenues per store, however, we report the growth in the ratio over the period analyzed and relate this back to the growth in revenue.

As the exhibit demonstrates, Delta grew faster than Gamma, because Gamma closed stores while Delta slightly increased the number of stores, and Delta grew revenues per store faster than Gamma. Growth in revenues per store is the key driver for these two companies, because the category is near full penetration. This growth in same-store sales is extremely important, to the point that financial analysts have a special name for growth in revenue per store: comps, shorthand for comparables, or year-to-year same-store sales. Why is this revenue growth important? First, the number of stores to open is an investment choice, whereas same-store sales growth reflects each store's ability to compete effectively in its local market. Second, new stores require large capital investments, whereas growth in comps requires little incremental capital. Hence, same-store sales growth comes with higher capital turnover, higher ROIC, and greater value creation.

Moving farther right in the tree, we gain additional insight into what has been driving same-store sales for each company. Delta also generated more foot traffic, increasing transactions per store at 2.5 percent versus Gamma's 1.2 percent. Revenues per transaction grew at the same rate for the two stores.

# CREDIT HEALTH AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE

To this point, we have focused on the operating performance of the company and its ability to create value. We have examined the primary drivers of value: a company's return on invested capital and organic revenue growth. In the final step of historical analysis, we focus on how the company has financed its operations. What proportion of invested capital comes from creditors instead of from equity investors? Is this capital structure sustainable? Can the company survive an industry downturn? How much cash, if any, has been distributed to shareholders?

To assess a company's capital structure, conduct four analyses. First, examine liquidity using coverage ratios. Liquidity measures the company's ability to meet short-term obligations, such as interest expenses and rental payments. Next, evaluate leverage using debt to EBITDA and debt to value. Leverage measures the company's ability to meet obligations over the long term. To evaluate equity, measure the payout ratio and operating value to EBITDA. The payout ratio measures the percentage of income being sent to shareholders. Operating value to EBITDA measures shareholders' future expectations of financial performance.

This section introduces the tools for evaluating a company's capital structure. Chapter 33 examines how capital structure decisions must be an integral part of a company's operating strategy and its plan for how it will return cash to shareholders.

# Measuring Liquidity Using Coverage Ratios

To estimate the company's ability to meet short-term obligations, analysts use ratios that incorporate three measures of earnings:

1. Earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA)
2. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)
3. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rental expense (EBITDAR)

With the first two earnings measures, you can calculate interest coverage. To do this, divide either EBITA or EBITDA by interest. The first coverage ratio, EBITA to interest, measures the company's ability to pay interest using profits without cutting capital expenditures intended to replace depreciating equipment. The second ratio, EBITDA to interest, measures the company's ability to meet short-term financial commitments using both current profits and the depreciation dollars earmarked for replacement capital. Although EBITDA provides a good measure of the short-term ability to meet interest payments, most companies cannot compete effectively without replacing worn assets.

An alternative is to divide EBITDAR by the sum of interest expense and rental expense. Like the interest coverage ratio, the EBITDAR ratio measures the company's ability to meet its known future obligations, including the effect of operating leases. For many companies, especially retailers and airlines,

including rental expenses is a critical part of understanding the financial health of the business.

Returning to our previous example of Costco and its peers, Exhibit 12.11 presents their financial data and coverage ratios. For 2018, Costco's coverage ratio of EBITA to interest equaled 31.6 times, whereas its peers had a ratio of 15.3 times. By most standards, Costco has very little debt, which is reflected in its extremely high AArating by Standard & Poor's. Costco's peers also have small amounts of leverage and high debt ratings, but to a lesser degree.

# Measuring Leverage

Over the past decade, interest rates have dropped to unprecedented lows, making interest coverage ratios uncharacteristically high. To evaluate leverage in this low-interest-rate environment, many analysts are now measuring and evaluating debt multiples such as debt to EBITDA or debt to EBITA. Given its much larger denominator, debt to EBITDA tends to be more stable, making assessments over time much clearer. The ratio also does a better job of teasing out companies that are exposed to rollover risk and widening default spreads, neither of which is captured when interest rates are extremely low.

A second reason the debt-to-EBITDA measure has gained in popularity involves the increased use of convertible securities. Many convertibles compensate through the potential conversion to equity rather than interest, making interest coverage ratios artificially high. By using the debt-to-EBITDA ratio, one can build a more comprehensive picture of the risk of leverage.

A variation of these debt multiples is the multiple of debt plus leases to EBITDAR. This multiple works best for companies with extensive operating leases, such as airlines and retailers.

To better understand the power—and danger—of leverage, consider the relationship between return on equity (ROE) and return on invested capital (ROIC):

$$
\mathrm {R O E} = \mathrm {R O I C} + [ \mathrm {R O I C} - (1 - T) k _ {d} ] \frac {D}{E}
$$

As the formula demonstrates, a company's ROE is a direct function of its ROIC, its spread of ROIC over its after-tax cost of debt  $(k_d)$ , and its book-based debt-to-equity ratio  $(D / E)$ . Consider a company that is earning an ROIC of 10 percent and has an after-tax cost of debt of 5 percent. To raise its ROE, the company can either increase its ROIC (through operating improvements) or increase its debt-to-equity ratio (by swapping debt for equity). Although each strategy can lead to an identical change in ROE, increasing the debt-to-equity ratio makes the company's ROE more sensitive to changes in operating performance (ROIC). Thus, while increasing the debt-to-equity ratio can increase ROE, it does so by increasing the risks faced by shareholders.

To assess leverage, measure the company's (market) debt-to-equity ratio over time and against peers. Does the leverage ratio compare favorably with the industry? How much risk is the company taking? Chapter 33 offers in-depth answers to these and other questions about the use of debt to finance operations.

# Payout Ratio

The dividend payout ratio equals total common dividends divided by net income available to common shareholders. We can better understand the company's financial situation by analyzing the payout ratio in relation to its cash flow reinvestment ratio:

- If the company has a high dividend payout ratio and a reinvestment ratio greater than 1, then it must be borrowing money to fund negative free cash flow, to pay interest, or to pay dividends. But is this sustainable?
- A company with positive free cash flow and low dividend payout is probably paying down debt (or accumulating excess cash). In this situation, is the company passing up the valuable tax benefits of debt or hoarding cash unnecessarily?

Applying these questions to Costco, we find that from 2015 to 2019, Costco generated  $14.7 billion in NOPAT, paid$ 1.1 billion in interest, and returned 9.5 billion to shareholders in dividends.

# Valuation Metrics

To conclude your assessment of capital structure, measure the shareholders' perception of future performance by calculating a market multiple. To build a market multiple, divide core operating value (defined in Chapter 10 as enterprise value less the market value of nonoperating assets, such as excess cash and nonconsolidated subsidiaries) by a normalizing factor, such as revenue, EBITA, or the book value of invested capital. By comparing the multiple of one company versus another, you can examine how the market perceives the company's future relative to other companies.

Exhibit 12.12 presents the operating-value-to-EBITDA multiples for Costco and its peers between 2005 and 2019. Although Costco traded in line with its peers from 2005 to 2011, its multiple has since increased substantially, while the multiple for its peers remained the same. We infer that Costco's higher multiple is driven by its stronger revenue growth and enduring higher ROIC.

While operating value to EBITDA is the most common measure of valuation, other measures, including operating value to EBITA and operating value to NOPAT, often provide helpful insights as well. For more on how to create and interpret valuation multiples, see Chapter 18.

Note: Operating value equals enterprise value less the book value of nonoperating assets.

# GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

Although it is impossible to provide a comprehensive checklist for analyzing a company's historical financial performance, here are some guidelines to keep in mind:

- Look back as far as possible (at least ten years). Long time horizons will allow you to determine whether the company and industry tend to revert to some normal level of performance and whether short-term trends are likely to be permanent.
- Disaggregate value drivers—both ROIC and revenue growth—as far as possible. If possible, link operational performance measures with each key value driver.
- If there are any radical changes in performance, identify the source. Determine whether the change is temporary, permanent, or merely an accounting effect.
- If possible, perform your analysis on a fine-grained level, not just on the company as a whole. Real insight comes from analysis of individual business units, product lines, and, if the data exist, even customers.

With historical analysis complete, we now have the appropriate context to build a robust set of forecasts, a critical ingredient of any valuation.
