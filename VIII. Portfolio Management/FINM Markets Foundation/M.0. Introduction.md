# M.0. Introduction

## Markets Foundations

### UChicago Financial Mathematics

#### September 2022

* Mark Hendricks
* hendricks@uchicago.edu

# This Course

## Objectives

The main objective is **context**!

* We are not here to cram and memorize everythinig you will need to know. 
* You will be learning throughout the year in courses, workshops, and many other opportunities. 

That learning will be faster and deeper if you have

* foundations (tools, terminology)
* context (map, questions, data)

The August Review course was a start.

## Multidisciplinary

This group has a **wide variety** of backgrounds/expertise.

Our curriculum covers a wide range of topics, including

* fixed income and their derivatives
* equities and their derivatives
* currencies
* commodities
* economics

We will consider these topics from various perspectives, 

* finance
* math
* stats
* computing
* industry practice

We do not expect that any of you are **quadruple majors** with work experience.

For areas that are

* New - lean into it
* Familiar - add perspective and depth
* Comfortable - dig into advanced topics

## Engagement

This is not a book club.

* We are not reading a textbook.
* We are meeting to **discuss**.

Be an active learner.

* Asking a question is not interrupting!
* Adding your perspective is valuable.
* I will manage the time and flow--don't worry about whether your question/perspective is at the right time.

Staying engaged.

* We will be in Jupyter notebooks every day.
* Use them to explore and extend on our topics.

## Get the Most Out of September Launch

Avoid common pitfalls.

### Hesitancy
* Being too cautious, wanting to wait until you know more to engage.
* Feeling too overwhelmed to just get going, one step at a time.
* Relying too much on group members to do the applications.

### Narrowly focusing
* Avoiding topic areas where you have less experience / interest.
* Not doing the prep to get the most out of each day.

## Why This Course
* Foundations for other courses
* Foundations for job search
