## Size of Fixed Income Markets

# Bond Market

The bond market is comprised of longer-term debt securities/loans than those in the money market.

* Bonds are referred to as the fixed income capital markets.
* Fixed income is a misleading term.
* As we saw with the fixed income money markets, many of the security cashflows are not actually fixed.

The term "bonds" is often used somewhat generally, referring to a range of longer maturity debt securities.

## Treasury Securities

See other note.

## Municipal bonds

Municipal bonds are issued by state and local governments.

* Interest income is exempt from federal income taxes, as well as state and local taxes in the issuing state.
* Capital gains taxes still apply.
* Due to the Federal income tax savings, municipal bonds are particularly attractive to those with high marginal tax rates.

## International bonds

Main international debt instrument has been foreign bonds.

* These are bonds issued by a foreign country, but denominated
in the currency of the market in which they are issued.
* ie. Sony issues a dollar-denominated bond in the U.S.

More recently, Eurobonds have become popular.

* These bonds are denominated in a currency other than that of
the country in which they are sold.
* Example: Suppose that a firm issues a bond in Japan with the bond denominated in U.S. dollars.
* The name "Eurobond" is perhaps unfortunate. It need not have anything to do with Europe or the Euro.

## Corporate bond payoffs

Corporate bond payoff structure varies:

* Most pay a semiannual coupon and return face value at maturity.
* May include issuer option to call bond early at face value - manage interest rate risk.
* May include issuer or bondholder option to convert to equity.

In the U.S., issuing firms may deduct the interest payments from the firm's taxes.

# Mortgages

Mortgages are loans to households and firms in order to buy land, real estate, or other structures.

* The primary mortgage lenders in the U.S. have been savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks, though recently, commercial banks have increased their role.
* The federal government plays an active role in this market.
* Three agencies, (commonly referred to as Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac, and Ginnie Mae,) buy a large amount of mortgages.
* Stated goal is to provide liquidity in the market and achieve certain government objectives regarding home ownership.

## Federal agency debt

Several government agencies issue their own securities.

* Agency debt securities are backed by specific revenue streams; it is not explicitly insured by the Federal government.
* Most of these are involved with funding U.S. mortgages. ie. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae.
* Implicitly, agency debt is fully backed by the U.S. government. In 2008, the Federal government assumed responsibility for the bonds of the above agencies.

## MBS

A mortgage-backed security (MBS) is a claim on a pool of mortgages or a claim backed by such a pool.

* The originator of the mortgage, (the lender,) usually services the loans.
* The servicing agent collects the homeowner payments and passes the principal and interest on to the MBS investment vehicle.
* The simplest MBS is a pass-through, a claim on a fraction of the total cash flow from the mortgages.

MBS allows for wide sharing of mortgage risk.

## ABS

Besides MBS, many other loans are pooled into securities.

These asset-backed securities (ABS) are backed by credit-card, auto, and student loans.
