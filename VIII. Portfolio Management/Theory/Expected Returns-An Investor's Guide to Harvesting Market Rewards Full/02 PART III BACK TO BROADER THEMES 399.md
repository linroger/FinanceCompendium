# Foreword

The first time I met Antti Ilmanen I thought he was insane. I was right. But, I was to discover quickly he was insane in a good way. The incident in question was at a new Ph.D. student mixer, about as exciting as it sounds, where seconds after being introduced to Antti he asked me "who do you rate in the top-five academics in finance and why?" He had his own answers on a set of Post-it notes. By the way, Antti has become famous for these Post-it notes. Suffice it to say if he consults the Post-its, and says you said something 17 years ago that turned out to be disproved in the latest Journal of Finance paper, just assume he's right and move on.

Getting back to my story, he couldn't understand how I couldn't name five. Truth be told I probably could have named maybe three academics in total, and as to justifying my choices with "why?", I was stuck at zero. I had not chosen finance because, like Antti, I was already obsessed with it. I chose it as my dad, a lawyer, forbade me to go to law school, I had some mild ability at mathematics, I recognized that finance might be both intellectually interesting and provide a good living, and finally I chose a Ph.D. as being a professor seemed like a nice life (little did I know the Sirens of Wall Street would soon call me away …) Antti looked at me with a "what the heck are you doing in the Ph.D. program" confused stare, and I politely ran away from the very intense, very finance-obsessed young Finn. Now,  $20+$  years later, and after countless similar incidents, I no longer run away (he finds me anyway), but he's still intense and obsessed with finance. Over the years, and specifically through this book, those traits of his have made us all better off.

One more aside before my foreword begins in earnest. I briefly considered not writing this foreword in protest or as a rearguard action. Antti gives away a lot in this book. Perhaps few true secrets (though there are some!), as this is more a textbook than original research. But he makes much of what has become called "quantitative finance" easily (OK,  $300+$  dense pages, in original format, of "easily") accessible in one place. Long term, that can't be good for people like me who make their livings from this stuff being at least a bit secret. But being skilled at game theory I quickly determined that if I didn't write the foreword somebody else would, so refusal would not accomplish much. With that strategy shot down, I very fleetingly considered having him killed, but this seemed to entail too much "tail risk" (see Chapters 15 and 19) and, anyway, is at least somewhat morally ambiguous. Besides, Antti's just the type to have stashed a Post-it at his lawyer with a note "in the event of my untimely …" So in the end I decided to smile and write the foreword, and just resolve to work harder (along with many others at my firm and others throughout the field) to give Antti material for a sequel  $20+$  years from now!

Now let's talk about the title subject.

Expected returns are how much you make on average over time on an investment or strategy. Risk is the possibility that, over any time horizon, you never get your expectation, as once again the world interferes with a perfectly good plan. Risk can make you fail to reach your expectations because of the simple uncertainty around expectations it brings, or because, as in 2008 for many, bad realizations call into question long-term survival or at least the ability to stick with a plan. Still, expected returns are incredibly important. If you survive and stick to a good plan, they add up nicely.

Antti has chosen to write a book on expected return in the Age of Risk. Risk, and particularly risk in the sense of survival, is all the rage in these days following a major financial crisis. This wide-ranging discussion of risk is right and proper. If some investors took too much risk and that caused or exacerbated the financial crisis, that's a pretty important event to learn from. If some investors thought risk was simple and all figured out, and got a black swan dropped on their heads, it is important to learn from that too. However, it's not the whole story.

While perhaps differing from the vast majority of risk-focused researchers and authors these days, I'd argue that the study of expected returns deserves more of our attention, even just after one of the biggest "left tails" in history. For one thing, as scary as the world got, some of our much maligned simple "normal" models actually did OK for all assets other than highly structured and/or levered ones, or over the very short term (see http://www.dimensional.com/famafrench/2009/05/how-unusual-was-the-stock-market-of-2008.html). For another thing, in a theme Antti returns to again and again in his book, expected returns don't have to stay the same throughout time. Part of what we see as "risk" materializing during events like the 2008 financial crisis, and the 1999-2000 tech bubble, are more accurately seen as investors misunderstanding or misestimating expected returns. In both those cases the extreme dénouement that followed occurred, at least according to many (and me), because before the disaster, investors were willing to accept far too low an expected return, first on stocks and specifically on technology stocks, and then a decade later on credit and real estate. In both the theory and the reality of these globe-shaking events, the discussions of risk and expected return are intimately linked.

So why so much more discussion of risk than expected return these days? Well, obviously the magnitude of recent events makes all of us greatly value the chance we could have avoided that pain. But again, a careful study of expected return might have easily, perhaps even more easily, led to the same protection by avoiding certain investments on the ground that their expected returns were too low. Frankly, I think a lot of the answer is that discussing risk is inherently sexier than discussing expected returns. Good forecasts of expected return add up over the long term, but don't matter for squat next week. Risk can kill you, or make you a hero, in the time it takes you to say "flash crash". Would you rather write about a tsunami or erosion? More specifically, from a safe perch, say the hindsight of authoring a book, which event would be more dramatic to narrate? The analogy, forced though it may be, continues to work as erosion, or expected return, might be mind-numbingly boring at any one moment, but it has a heck of a lot to say about how the future will be shaped.

For perspective, you want to see a black swan? Try making nothing on your equities in your final 20 years until retirement because you bought them at an extremely high price (low expected return). That is one pile of ebony long-necked bird. If risk is about surviving the short term, expected return is about whether, after surviving, you think it was worth it.

Here's another secret. Besides being at least as important, estimating expected returns is much harder than estimating risk. Now, estimating risk is no easy task. But at least finance wears its insecurity on its sleeve here. Are returns "normal" or do we have to worry about "black swans", "fat tails", and all that? This worry and effort is worthwhile, but those trying to estimate the expected return on various assets smile at those taking on the comparatively easy task of estimating risk. Basically, you need a heck of a lot more data to estimate expected returns than to estimate risk. In geek-speak, the first moment laughs at and taunts the second moment (which I'm going to pretend for a second is all you need for risk). The second moment gives up its secrets reluctantly, but far more readily than that more covert first moment. To estimate risk we lament (as statisticians not humanitarians) that we don't get to see a few more disasters. To estimate expected return we lament we don't get to see a few more centuries.

Now that the motivation behind and the difficulty of Antti's task is clear, let's talk about how one might actually try to forecast expected returns. Starting with the very big picture, why is there a positive expected return (let's make that positive relative to some riskless rate or, in other words, a positive risk premium) on any asset or investment strategy? Well, there are two possible reasons. First, in a rational world you should get paid a positive expected return for bearing a risk others don't wish to bear. As an aside, Antti repeatedly hammers home the poorly understood point that you should get paid particularly well for bearing risks that hurt you exactly when it is most painful to be hurt, and less or not at all for risks that only bring you harm when all is well. Second, in a world that permits some irrationality, you can also get paid for someone else's systematic mistakes (or pay for your own).

While this parsing is useful, and Antti makes great use of it throughout the book, he takes it further, examining expected returns along three different dimensions (and asking the rational vs. irrational question for each part):

(1) The expected return you get paid for owning any of the major asset classes (stocks, bonds, commodities, etc.).

(2) The expected return you get from pursuing well-known strategies such as value investing, momentum investing, and carry-based investing. These are fundamentally different from the returns in (1) as, for instance, in examining value investing you don't count the expected return from just being long stocks, but rather the extra return that has historically accrued to value stocks vs. the universe of all stocks. These strategies also tend to be far more dynamic than the asset classes in (1), changing their portfolio holdings more often through time.

(3) The expected return you get from being willing to take the risk of being exposed to economic or other risks (e.g., shocks to growth, shocks to inflation, liquidity risk, etc.).

These are all connected and overlapping. For instance, passive ownership of equities exposes you more to risk of poor real economic growth than does passive ownership of bonds, which exposes you more to risk of higher-than-expected inflation. Small stocks expose you to more liquidity risk than large ones. The overlapping descriptions go on and on. Antti doesn't mean for these three ways to look at expected returns to be a clean decomposition, rather he finds use for all three at once (remember, he calls this art and science). He continually stresses that there is no perfect way to examine (or later forecast) expected returns. You want to use every framework that is useful and brings anything new to the study. In this sense his three-way examination succeeds handily.

OK, let's recap. So there are two ways you can get a positive expected return, by taking a risk you get paid for (roughly, "beta"), or by outsmarting someone else ("alpha"). There are three useful perspectives to examine the source of expected returns: asset classes, systematic strategies, and risk factors such as economic growth and liquidity. Exposure to any of these three can generate a positive return for either of the first two reasons (rational compensation for risk, or outsmarting of others who are less than rational). Now we're cooking. All we need now—assuming we have identified one or more of the three categories of sources of expected returns (from the overlapping categories of asset class, strategy, and risk factor exposure) and have a theory as to why an investor gets paid this expected return (rational vs. irrational)—is a way to estimate the size of that expected return going forward. Here, you guessed it, Antti gives us not one but three very useful methods. They are again complementary—not competitors. In order from weakest to strongest (Antti's ordering which I agree with): (1) you can forecast the future from looking purely at how something has done in the past, (2) you can forecast the future based solely on your theory of how the world should work without examining data, (3) you can jump straight to current measures (e.g., the P/E of the stock market, the nominal or real yield on bonds) and use them to forecast. Like Antti, for reasons you'll have to get from the book, I favor (3), but even using current measures like P/E and yield you still need history and theory. You would like some theory to guide why you think today's stock market P/E should be related to its future return, and probably would like some evidence that this has historically been an effective tool.

So, remember, there are two reasons you might get paid an expected return, three overlapping ways to parse the different sources of expected returns, and three nonmutually exclusive methods to estimate the expected return going forward, all probably containing part but not all the truth, so all must be strongly considered, but none blindly, and all at once. You got that?

Well, I didn't promise you this would be simple, did I? In fact, I told you the opposite. Expected returns are interesting precisely because they are hard (and very important)! This means there is no easy answer. But, it also means that effort on this front is potentially highly valuable. Understanding easy but very important problems is also important, but the barriers to entry are low, and getting an advantage from such an easy understanding is usually difficult because the understanding is so widespread. (On the other hand, the investing public's continued failure to understand basic ideas like diversifying widely, keeping average costs low, and realizing that it is hard to beat the market, etc., makes even this effort worthwhile to the marginal investor.) But, understanding deeply, if imperfectly, what many don't understand at all or even get backwards (like the common error of thinking expected returns are especially high going forward after realized returns have had an exceptionally good run), well, that is great stuff!

Antti's book is complicated and dense. The best compliment I can pay it is that it's not more complicated than it has to be. It chooses to take on a hard question and is honest about this degree of difficulty. It chooses to offer multiple overlapping methods at each point, as there truly is not one certain method, and each brings some value. Another, far weaker, even harmful, book could tell you that forecasting long-term future returns is easy. That all you have to do is listen to the author's simple formula and prosper (Dow 36,000 anyone?). Antti tells you it's hard. He says if you follow our best minds, and use the best data we have, you probably have an edge, or at least your mistakes are not silly, but he says it is art and science, and makes no guarantees.

If I can leave you with advice that applies directly to Antti's book, but is actually far more general, it's to listen to people who take on difficult problems boldly. Listen to people who are honest that our best hope is improved but not perfect understanding. Listen to people who aren't afraid to tell you the world is a complicated place, but then are damned talented at making it as simple as possible (but no simpler).

In other words, read this book. Listen to Antti.

# Acknowledgments

I have been a student of expected asset returns for over 20 years while wearing many different hats: buy-side bond portfolio manager in the Finnish central bank, Ph.D. scholar at the University of Chicago (UofC), bond research analyst at Salomon Brothers, sell-side strategist and prop trader at Salomon/Citigroup, and hedge fund trader and strategist at Brevan Howard. I have also advised various institutional investors on their long-term investment strategies—most regularly for Norway's sovereign wealth fund in semiannual expert panel meetings. It is mainly this last experience that has inspired this book.

OK, that was too mildly put. I confess: I have been obsessed with expected returns. The passion for the topic arose in as different places as the Bank of Finland in Helsinki and the UofC campus in Hyde Park.

I earned my finance doctorate at the University of Chicago Business School (now the Booth School of Business) in the early 1990s, with Professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French as my dissertation chairmen. In many minds this background puts me squarely in the efficient markets' camp. However, we Chicago finance students were not taught a dogma. Instead, we were given a lifelong desire to learn more about financial markets with the emphasis on an empirical approach: let ideas compete freely and let data be the judge. The EMH paradigm gave a very useful framework for understanding and analyzing markets, but few of us became EMH purists. Indeed, many of the anomalies that challenged the EMH were uncovered by Chicago professors and students. I hope that readers will find my treatment of risk-based and behavioral explanations for expected returns surprisingly balanced.

Fama and French are also among my leading lights when I tackle that perennial question "if your ideas have any investment value, why would you share them?" Evidence abounds that business gains accrue to perceived thought-leaders. Yet, many serious writers publish for less selfish reasons as well. They want to enhance the general investor experience and improve the marketplace.

Chicago also had other superb finance and economics professors and besides faculty we got great guest speakers in the finance workshops. Naturally, I had more active dialogue with fellow students, many of whom became excellent talking-partners and friends over the years. Cliff Asness is of course the best known. I humbly thank him for the characteristically witty and insightful foreword and for making it clear to the reader in the first lines of his foreword that I am insane in a good way.

I have been lucky with bosses: my managers at the Bank of Finland taught me the ropes and assigned me the role of a bridge between academia and practitioners much before I had any expertise to fulfill this role. After my Chicago years, my bosses at Salomon Brothers' storied Bond Portfolio Analysis Group let me balance research and market roles, always stressing the value of conveying complex ideas as intuitively as possible. At Brevan Howard, the co-CEOs allowed me to take different roles, some outside the core hedge fund business, and recognized the value of this book for institutional investors. It helps that the book's themes have little to do with Brevan Howard's core approach of tactical rates trading based on fundamental macro-views with a focus on trade construction and risk management, so I will not be revealing any proprietary trade secrets.

This book has been hugely influenced by my regular meetings in Oslo discussing the long-run investment strategy for Norway's sovereign wealth fund. One outgrowth of those meetings has been even more inspirational—our trialogue with Knut Kjaer and Andrew Ang about diverse long-horizon investor topics.

I have benefited from the thinking of fellow students, colleagues, customers, and research peers in academia and business. Some of the best sources I have yet to meet personally, but I am a voracious reader—to which this book's lengthy reference list attests. There are too many people to thank by name, but I make an exception for Rory Byrne to whom this book is dedicated. For several years Rory was my main partner in developing and implementing systematic trading models and always a sensible sounding board. Sadly, Rory succumbed last year to a persistent tumor at the age of 35.

A most emphatic thank-you goes to Laurence Siegel, Knut Kjaer, Matti Ilmanen, and Victor Haghani who carefully read the manuscript (or evolving versions of it) and greatly improved the book. I am also grateful to Andrew Ang, Cliff Asness, William Bernstein, Francis Breedon, Alistair Byrne, Adrian Eterovic, Kenneth French, Pal Haugerud, Susan Hudson-Wilson, Doug Huggins, Ray Iwanowski, Matthew James, Robert Kosowski, John Liew, Thomas Maloney, Mikko Niskanen, Lasse Heje Pedersen, Jonas Rinné, Rudi Schadt, Matti Suominen, Etienne Varloot, and Gerlof de Vrij, for their helpful comments on parts of my manuscript. I also thank my editors Pete Baker, Aimee Dibbens, Vivienne Wickham and their colleagues at Wiley for all their help, as well as Neil Shuttlewood, whose company OPS Ltd managed the project. Of course, the responsibility for any errors is mine. In a work of this size, some errors are bound to creep in. I welcome any comments on them as well as other feedback (antti.ilmanen@gmail.com). I credit my data sources separately in Appendix B.

Finally, I thank my family, the source of the most precious expected and realized returns. The family in Finland: My mother and siblings as well as my late father who taught me the love of reading through example and who urged me to read in a way that advances my knowledge systematically ("try to position each new piece of knowledge in its correct place in the star sky"). My Nordic background and values likely helped counterbalance any free market ideology picked up at UofC or material interests in a banking and hedge fund career. And the family in Bad Homburg: My rocks, dear Annette as well as Kukka and Akseli, I am hugely grateful for your understanding during this long project. I just hope I can be as supportive when it is your turn.
