# Introduction

- This book covers the general topic of expected returns on investments. The traditional paradigm among institutional investors focuses too much on historical performance and too narrowly on asset class allocation. This book argues that investment decision making should be broadened beyond the asset class perspective and a wider set of inputs should be used for assessing expected returns.
- The book considers in detail a wide range of return sources: major asset classes (stocks, bonds, and alternative investments) and strategy styles (value, carry, momentum, and so forth) as well as risk factors (such as growth, inflation, and liquidity).
- The main inputs—beyond discretionary views—for investors to judge expected returns are (1) historical performance, (2) theories, and (3) forward-looking indicators. A better understanding of these inputs and a better balance among them is needed.
- Well-known evidence of historical asset returns include the significant long-run outperformance of stocks over bonds (less so in the 19th and 21st century than in the 20th century) as well as more moderate rewards for bearing interest rate risk and credit risk.
- Less familiar historical findings include the pervasive success of value, carry, and momentum strategy styles in several markets as well as the tenuous relation between volatility and average returns. This book highlights the low long-run returns of the most volatile assets within each asset class, a finding that may reflect risk-seeking ("lottery-playing") behavior by investors, or that may be explained by leverage constraints.
- Finance theories have changed dramatically over the past 30 years, away from the restrictive theories of the single-factor CAPM, efficient markets, and constant expected returns. Current academic views are more diverse, less tidy, and more realistic. Expected returns are now commonly seen as driven by multiple factors. Some determinants are rational (risk and liquidity premia), others irrational (psychological biases such as extrapolation and overconfidence). Expected returns on all factors may vary over time.
- A central insight from academic finance theories is that required asset returns have little to do with an asset's standalone volatility and more to do with when losses can be expected to occur. Investors should require high-risk premia for assets that fare poorly in bad times, whereas safe haven assets (that fare well in bad times and less well in good times) can justify low or even negative risk premia. Strategies that resemble selling financial catastrophe insurance—steady small gains punctuated by infrequent but large losses—warrant especially high risk premia because their losses are so highly concentrated in the worst times.
- Forward-looking indicators such as valuation ratios have a better track record in forecasting future asset class returns than rearview mirror measures. The practice of using historical average returns as best estimates of future returns is dangerous when expected returns vary over time. Recall stock markets in 1999–2000.
- Long-run expected returns for any investment tend to be especially high following adverse events. For example, equity markets tend to have predictably higher returns after recessions, and nominal bonds after high inflations.
- Investors can try to boost expected returns by taking risks that produce attractive rewards for all market participants (beta risks) and/or by skillful active management (alpha) which may involve exploiting regularities and market inefficiencies. This book offers a comprehensive guide for smart harvesting of beta risk premia, covering both long-run exposures to traditional and alternative betas as well as tactical beta timing. However, I concede from the outset that the magic of view-based alpha generation cannot be conveyed in a book.
- Two visual aids—an elephant and a cube—help the reader keep "the big picture" in mind through the book.
- Although I present large amounts of empirical evidence about historical returns and forward-looking indicators, as well as numerous theories in an attempt to make sense of the data, I believe it is important to stress humility. Hindsight bias makes us forget how difficult forecasting is, especially in highly competitive financial markets. Expected returns are unobservable and our understanding of them is limited. Even the best experts' forecasts are noisy estimates of prospective returns.

It was six men of Hindostan,

To learning much inclined,

Who went to see the elephant

(Though all of them were blind);

That each by observation

Might satisfy his mind.

—J.G. Saxe (to be continued)

The traumatic housing and credit crisis that began in 2007 challenged many beliefs about investing and financial markets. The aftershocks of the crisis are still felt in many markets and economies (not least in public finances), but it is no longer necessary or advisable to view the future solely through the prism of this crisis. Instead, this book surveys the landscape of expected returns and long-term investment prospects based on lessons learned over decades.

The traditional paradigm of institutional investing focuses on relatively static asset class allocations that are largely determined by historical performance. We must go back to basics and broaden the traditional paradigm in two ways. The inputs used for assessing expected returns should be better balanced and the idea of what constitutes investments should be challenged beyond the asset class perspective.

Figure 1.1. The elephant: Shining light on expected returns from different directions.

The foremost need for multi-dimensional thinking is on inputs. When investors make judgments about the expected returns of various investments, they should guard against being blinded by past performance and must ensure that they take all or most of the following considerations into account:

- historical average returns;
- financial and behavioral theories:
- forward-looking market indicators such as bond yields; and
- discretionary views.

Figure 1.1 recalls the parable about several blind men and an elephant, as told by the American poet John Godfrey Saxe (1816-1887), each man describing one part of the elephant from his narrow vantage point. One man is feeling the leg and calling it a tree, another touching the ear and naming it a fan, a third mistaking the tail for a rope, and so on. Each man misses the big picture—and so will investors who study expected returns from a single vantage point.

The first approached the elephant,

And happening to fall

Against his broad and sturdy side,

At once began to bawl,

"Bless me, it seems the elephant

Is very like a wall."

So the challenge is to refine the art of investment decision making in a way that exploits all our knowledge about historical experience, theories, and current market conditions, without being overly dependent on any one of these. This book will summarize the state of knowledge on all these aspects, but it focuses on the first three inputs since these are systematic. I have less to say about discretionary views since these are inherently investor specific. However, the approaches described in this book will help readers form such views. Stated differently, investing involves both art and science; a solid background in the science can improve the artist.

Figure 1.2. The cube: Three perspectives on investments and their expected returns.

Before turning to these inputs, I address the reasonable question "Expected returns on what?" The traditional paradigm has been to break the complex world of investments into simplified groupings called asset classes. Analyzing, and allocating to, asset classes has been the dominant approach but I argue that studying investments from perspectives other than asset classes can enhance our understanding of return sources and our ability to diversify effectively. This book will add to the asset class perspective the complementary viewpoints of strategy styles and risk factors, as in the three-dimensional "cube" in Figure 1.2:

- Starting with the asset class perspective, I will cover all traditional asset classes (equities, government bonds, credits) plus many alternative ones (including real estate, commodities, hedge funds, and private equity). I focus on long-run returns but also review tactical market-timing approaches. A broader mindset naturally leads to questioning the traditional 60/40 portfolio which relies excessively on one source of excess returns (the equity premium) and which therefore has highly concentrated risk (more than  $90\%$  of portfolio volatility is due to equities).
- The strategy style perspective is especially important for understanding the profit potential of popular active-trading approaches. Value, carry, momentum, and volatility styles have outperformed buy-and-hold investments in many asset classes. Styles can also offer better diversification opportunities than asset classes.
- Sophisticated investors are increasingly trying to look beyond asset classes and strategies in order to identify the underlying factors driving their portfolio returns. A factor-based approach is also useful for thinking about the primary function of each asset class in a portfolio (stocks for harvesting growth-related premia, certain alternatives for illiquidity premia, Treasuries for deflation hedging, and so on) as well as for diversifying across economic scenarios. Among underlying risk factors, I opt to focus on growth, inflation, illiquidity, and tail risks (volatility, correlation, return asymmetries).

The second, feeling of his tusk,

Cried, "Ho! What have we here

So very round and smooth and sharp?

To me, 'tis mighty clear

This wonder of an elephant

Is very like a spear."

How can investors deal with the complexity of multiple inputs and perspectives, let alone with the even more bewildering assortment of novel investment products on offer? This book provides a map to investors, giving a bird's eye view over a rugged terrain and occasionally zooming in to interesting locations (12 case studies), not unlike Google Earth™. I hope my two visual aids—the elephant and the cube—will help readers keep the forest in sight among the many trees along the way.

Next, Sections 1.1-1.4 give an overview on the four perspectives on "feeling the elephant" (i.e., on considerations for judging expected returns). These themes will be expanded on through the book.

# 1.1 HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE

Historical average returns are a common starting point for judging expected returns. The idea is that if expected returns are constant over time, long-run average realized return is a good estimate of expected future return. Unexpected news dominates returns in the short run but the effects of such news tend to cancel out in the long run.

Why should you think twice before using historical returns as forecasts of future returns?

- Any sample period may be biased—in the sense of not being representative of market expectations—so that unexpected returns do not neatly cancel out, especially if the sample starts or ends at times of exceptionally high or low market valuations. Windfall capital gains during a benign sample can boost average returns meaningfully even over multiple decades. Bond indices are a prime example, given the downtrend in bond yields since the 1970s and 1980s when a number of the widely used bond index histories start.
- In principle, longer historical windows reduce sample specificity and enable more accurate estimates of average returns. However, distant historical data may be irrelevant due to structural changes, apart from lower data quality. Would we really want to include data from the 1600s even if good-quality returns were available to us?
- Expected returns may vary over time in a cyclical fashion, which makes extrapolation of multi-year performance particularly dangerous. Periods of high realized returns and rising asset valuations—think stock markets in the 1990s—are often associated with falling forward-looking returns.
- For specific funds and strategies, the historical performance data that investors get to see are often upward biased. This bias is due to the voluntary nature of performance reporting and survivorship bias (so that poor performers are left out of databases or are not marketed by the fund manager). A similar caveat applies to simulated "paper" portfolios because backtests may be overfitted and trading costs ignored or understated.

These concerns notwithstanding, this book presents extensive evidence of long-run realized returns, when possible covering 50-to-100-year histories. Several main findings are familiar to most readers:

- Stock markets have outperformed fixed income markets during the past century in all countries studied. The compound average real return for global equities between 1900 and 2009 is  $5.4\%$ , which is  $3.7\%$  ( $4.4\%$ ) higher than that of long-term government bonds (short-dated Treasury bills). Stocks' outperformance over bonds is  $0.5\%$  to  $0.8\%$  higher for the U.S. than globally and was even more pronounced before the negative returns in 2000s. The experience of the current investor generation has buried the myth that stocks always beat bonds over 20-year or 30-year horizons. (This myth was never true. Many exceptions to it occurred outside the U.S. in the 20th century and inside the U.S. during the 19th century.)
- Among fixed income markets, long-term bonds have outperformed short-dated bonds by  $0.5\%$  to  $1\%$  and credit-risky corporate bonds have outperformed comparable government bonds by  $0.3\%$  to  $1\%$  (low end for investment-grade bonds, high end for high-yield bonds). More surprisingly, the reward for bearing interest rate risk or credit risk is most consistent at short maturities. At the back end of the yield curve and at the low end of the credit spectrum there has been scant long-run benefit for additional risk taking.
- Illiquid assets have tended to offer moderately higher long-run returns than their liquid peers. Part of corporate bonds' excess returns over Treasuries reflects the liquidity disadvantage of corporates, and the same appears true for small-cap stocks over large-cap stocks. Evidence across asset classes is more ambiguous because various reporting biases may overstate published private equity and hedge fund returns. Moreover, average return differences can reflect premia for various risks and not just for illiquidity; disentangling the determinants is quite hard.

Other findings are less widely known:

- Certain active strategy styles have proved profitable in several asset classes, adding several percentage points to annual average returns. The most prominent styles are value (overweighting assets that appear cheap based on some valuation metrics, while underweighting richly valued peers), carry (overweighting high-yielding assets while underweighting low-yielding assets), and momentum (overweighting assets that have outperformed over multiple months while underweighting recent laggards). The rewards from simulated active strategies are often overstated due to overfitting or selection biases. Yet the value, carry, and momentum profits have been so prevalent that there is little doubt that these opportunities really existed in the past. The pertinent question is whether these strategies will remain profitable now that they are so well known. If their profits represent (at least in part) risk premia rather than market inefficiencies, it is less likely that future excess returns will be fully competed away.
- A flipside of the value effect is that "growth assets"—stocks of firms or countries with high past and expected growth rates—often deliver poor long-run returns that can be traced back to their high valuation ratios. One behavioral explanation is that investors over-extrapolate past growth rates and thus overpay for growth assets. No investment is attractive at any price, however fast growing it has been.
- Yield seeking has been profitable in many contexts but more so in cross-country trades than in within-country trades. The worst results are for complex carry products that may contain hidden costs and risks.
- Chasing returns sounds very naive but favoring past winners has not been a bad strategy historically—as long as history lengths to measure past returns are judiciously selected. Details differ across asset classes but most investments exhibit momentum (continuation) tendency over multi-month horizons and a mild reversal tendency over multi-year horizons.
- The empirical relation between volatility and expected returns is tenuous. Volatility and long-term average returns are positively related across asset classes. Moreover, a strategy of writing equity index options earns positive long-run returns, a justifiable reward given the inherent riskiness of effectively selling financial catastrophe insurance. However, the most volatile assets within each asset class—high-volatility stocks, 30-year Treasuries, and CCC-rated corporates—tend to offer low long-run returns and even worse risk-adjusted returns. This surprising pattern may reflect investors' lottery-seeking bias (overpaying for the hope of jackpot returns) as well as leverage constraints (overpaying for inherently volatile assets that give high bang for the buck for naive return seekers). Avoiding the inherently volatile pockets of each market (lottery tickets) and leveraging up inherently stable assets have boosted returns in the past, even before the leverage restrictions were tightened in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis.

# 1.2 FINANCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL THEORIES: A BRIEF HISTORY OF IDEAS

The third approached the animal

And happening to take

The squirming trunk within his hands

Then boldly up and spake:

"I see," quoth he, "the elephant

Is very like a snake."

Finance is a field in which academics and investment practitioners have had a huge influence on each other, as highlighted in Peter Bernstein's books *Capital Ideas* and its sequel *Capital Ideas Evolving*. The theory of finance evolved dramatically during the last half-century, contemporaneously with the period during which investing grew into a big professional business. Until the 1950s finance theory hardly existed: the focus was on predicting cash flows, not on risk or required returns. Then, three decades of pioneering research brought about an academic consensus view that relatively simple theories employing highly restrictive assumptions—the single-factor CAPM, the efficient market hypothesis, constant risk premia—could explain asset prices and expected returns:

- A starting point in finance is that investors set prices so that an asset's cost equals its expected benefits. Aggregating across investors, each asset's market price equals the expected sum of its future cash flows discounted to the present value (i.e., expected cash flows are divided by  $1 +$  Discount rate).
- Asset-pricing theory focuses on the determinants of discount rates or required returns. In market equilibrium, an asset's expected return equals the required return that rational investors together demand. Risk-averse investors do not use the riskless rate for discounting, unless the cash flow being discounted is itself riskless; the discount rate also reflects the required compensation for the riskiness of an asset's expected future cash flows. This compensation in turn reflects both the amount of risk and the intensity of investor aversion toward risk.
- According to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), an asset's amount of risk is fully captured by its (equity) market beta, while general investor risk aversion determines the size of the market risk premium. Each asset's expected return in excess of a common riskless rate equals the product of the asset's beta (sensitivity to market movements) and the common market risk premium. The difference in expected returns across assets reflects only differences in the betas of the assets. Investors can boost long-run returns by bearing more beta risk: by holding higher beta stocks and by shifting allocations from fixed income (with beta near zero) to equities (with beta near one).
- Given the assumption of constant expected returns, the long-run average of realized returns is a good estimate of expected return, even if realized and expected returns can differ sharply over any short time window. Attempts to time the market were deemed a particularly wasteful form of active trading because moving from equities to cash implies forfeiting the large and presumably constant equity premium.

Such restrictive theories did not prove sufficient to explain real market behavior. As new evidence accumulated, both academic and investor opinions evolved:

- In recent decades, high-beta stocks and high-volatility stocks gave no return advantage, perhaps the reverse. Value and momentum tilts were more consistent return enhancers among equities, while related carry and trend strategies fared well in other asset markets.
- The realized premium of equities over bonds turned out to be slim compared with earlier histories, and views on the future equity premium were trimmed down.
- Several very large boom-bust cycles made the idea of constant risk premia less credible and that of market timing more acceptable.
- After the cult of equity busted around the year 2000, alternative assets, carry trades, and harvesting illiquidity premia became the preferred ways to boost returns. All these approaches resulted in dramatic losses in 2008.
- Just when investors learned to value conservatism, junk bonds and speculative stocks rallied by at least  $100\%$  in the year ensuing the crash bottom in March 2009.

So where are we now? Current academic views are more diverse, less tidy, and more realistic than they used to be. Between 1980 and 2010, empirical and theoretical work added flesh to the core models by incorporating multiple risk factors, time-varying expected returns, liquidity effects and other market frictions, as well as investor irrationality. The field is increasingly seeking help from outside finance, economics, and statistics by turning to psychology, biology, physics, and even philosophy.

Greater realism is welcome but is no panacea. Theories can only enhance our understanding if they simplify the messy real world. In that spirit, I highlight some core ideas that apply to all investments.

# Complex reality with multiple return drivers, both rational and irrational

If investors want to earn expected returns higher than the riskless rate, the most reliable way is to bear risks that markets reward with a premium. A less reliable way is to pursue active management, in which successful investors (skillful or lucky) reap gains at the expense of their less successful peers.

The simple story of a single risk factor, constant expected returns, and fully rational investors is outdated. Even in a more complex world with several drivers of required returns, equity market beta—or more generally sensitivity to economic growth—remains the most important risk source. Beyond equity market beta, exposures to inflation, illiquidity, and tail risks (such as volatility) influence many assets and are rewarded.

The interrelations between factors matter. Portfolio diversification is more effective with independent or, even better, with negatively correlated return sources. However, many return sources tend to be positively correlated—and especially so during a systemic crisis such as that of 2008. I will present return analysis separately for numerous factors or return sources but I already note that these can overlap with each other or be empirically correlated (I show some evidence at the beginning of Chapter 16).

The rewards may have rational or irrational origins. Numerous behavioral stories explain the high returns of certain asset types or trading strategies as being due to mispricing rather than fair compensation for risk. I present many examples of irrationality, emphasizing investors' extrapolation as well as overand underreaction tendencies as drivers behind the long-run outperformance of value and momentum strategies.

# Expected return differentials across assets depend less on volatility …

Many investors view the risk-reward tradeoff as being determined through an asset's standalone risk. Stocks are more volatile than bonds and thus deserve higher long-run returns. Likewise, long bonds are more volatile than short bonds and thus deserve higher long-run returns. This idea points in the right direction—that risk influences expected returns—but misses the fact that all volatility is not equal.

Each asset reflects a bundle of underlying risk factors and some idiosyncratic risk. Diversifiable (idiosyncratic) risks should not earn any reward; only systematic risks (those that cannot be eliminated through diversification) can be expected to be rewarded with a premium. The reward for volatility can differ depending on which of several systematic factors is the source of the volatility. Overall, the theoretical relation between volatility and expected return is quite ambiguous (and, as already noted, the empirical relation is tenuous).

# … and more on the typical timing of losses

Although there are a number of different risk factors, one key rational theme explains what drives financial risk premia. Assets or factors that perform poorly in "bad times"—think of recessions and financial crises—warrant high required returns. Conversely, safe haven assets (such as long-term government bonds, at least since the late 1990s) that smooth portfolio returns in bad times deserve a low risk premium. This central insight in modern academic finance about asset risk premia implies that certain assets and/or strategies deserve high long-term returns (and offer especially juicy returns in good times) exactly because they tend to give a terrible performance just when it hurts investors most. Many practitioners and policymakers had to wait until 2008 to learn this lesson, the hard way.

Figure 1.3. Asset class performance in the long run vs. in bad times. Sources: Bloomberg, Ken French's website, Citigroup, Barclays Capital, S&P GSCI, MIT-CRE.

For illustration, Figure 1.3 scatterplots 50-year average real returns of various U.S. asset classes on a simple proxy of "bad times performance"—average losses in arguably the three worst years (1974, 1981, 2008) for financial markets and the global economy during this half-century. The empirical relation is hardly linear but the assets with the best long-run performance—small-cap stocks—also gave the worst losses in bad times. At the other end, Treasury bills and bonds with low long-run returns were the best safe haven assets in bad times (more so in deflationary 2008 than in inflationary years).

Traditional equity and bond investments have well-understood risks and premia, but the same cannot be said for investments with asymmetric risk profiles ("picking up pennies in front of a steamroller"). Investors should be especially wary of strategies that amount to selling tail insurance or "lottery tickets" that pay off in bad times—writing options on equity indices, carry trading, and harvesting illiquidity premia. These strategies combine the dangers of (i) asymmetric returns and (ii) the coincidence of large losses with bad times. The long-run returns of such strategies are justifiably high, but these returns are concentrated in good times and tend to persist only until a bad event materializes. I do not have 50-year histories for such strategies but I will document below strong long-run returns for selling volatility, seeking carry, and harvesting illiquidity premia—as well as dramatic losses for each in 2008. In contrast, trend-following strategies have a surprisingly consistent record as safe havens during bad times.

Investors should not be misled by the apparently attractive reward-risk ratios of illiquid assets. These assets warrant an extra premium because of their illiquidity and poor performance in liquidity droughts, while infrequent price moves artificially understate their measured riskiness. Illiquid assets naturally suit long-horizon investors with limited liquidity needs, but even such investors should not assume that illiquidity is always amply rewarded.

# Expected rewards on all return sources can vary over time

It may now seem quaint to talk about constant expected returns but for long this was one of the classic assumptions in finance. While many practitioners questioned this assumption, market timing was generally avoided. The reasons were manifold: timing was not easy (being right too early often equals being wrong, with substantial career risk); the directional bet is highly concentrated (unlike security selection that at least benefits from diversified exposures); and cash holdings miss out the equity premium (which was seen to be especially high before the 2000s' experience).

The boom-bust cycles of the past decade shifted the consensus to embrace the idea that expected returns vary over time. Market timing no longer had such a bad name. Investors began to pay attention to forward-looking valuation ratios.

# 1.3 FORWARD-LOOKING INDICATORS

The fourth stretched out his eager hand

And felt about the knee,

"What most this mighty beast is like

"Is mighty plain," quoth he;

"Tis clear enough the elephant

Is very like a tree."

Forward-looking indicators such as earnings yields and bond yields are often better than historical average returns at forecasting long-term returns. Time-varying expected returns can make historical average returns very misleading as forecasts of future returns. For example, because stock prices were unusually high, the prospective returns on equities were especially low in 2000 after nearly two decades of outstanding realized returns. Conversely, the halving of global equity values between October 2007 and October 2008 surely did not hurt the prospects for subsequent long-term equity returns.

Empirical evidence suggests that near-term returns of risky assets are relatively high around business cycle troughs and relatively low around business cycle peaks. The two main explanations for the apparent countercyclic pattern in ex ante returns are (1) rationally time-varying risk premia and (2) irrational market mispricing. Time-varying risk premia may reflect variation in the amount of risk and/or market risk aversion. One compelling rational reason for boom-bust cycles is that risk aversion is wealth dependent and thus amplifies the gyrations in stock market valuations over time. Many people are more risk averse during recessions, which can create a feedback loop that pushes asset prices lower. (A similar feedback loop pushes already high prices higher, causing bubbles.) An alternative interpretation suggests that irrational fear or gloomy cash flow forecasts cause low market valuations during recessions. Market data cannot distinguish between rational and irrational stories, and both may have contributed to the observed return predictability.

It is not just the equity premium that varies predictably over time—most premia do. Such time variation is most obvious in the fluctuations of credit spreads, but I will review many other examples. The inflation risk premium in nominal bonds was clearly higher in the 1980s than in the 2000s, while the illiquidity premium in many assets shifted from negligible in 2006-2007 to record high levels in 2008-2009. When salient adverse events for any risk factor materialize, the ex ante premium tends to widen and then only gradually decay from elevated levels, with the pace of the decay perhaps related to lingering investor memories.

Endogenous sources of return and risk—sources arising from within the marketplace—are a recent topic of interest and may affect any investment. The persistent success of any asset class or trading strategy leads to a "virtuous" cycle of growing popularity and further success, resulting in eventual overcrowding and subsequent disappointments. The more persistent the success and the more asymmetric the payoff, the more likely that this virtuous cycle turns vicious, ending with a rush to exit by return-chasers and leveraged traders. Sharp liquidations tend to occur amidst tightening financial conditions, and these in turn reinforce price and liquidity declines. These forces contribute to the short-term momentum and long-term reversal patterns observed for many investments.

Let us not move from the extreme of no market timing to the other extreme of thinking it is easy. It is only easy with hindsight. The market's required returns and cash flow expectations are not directly observable. We only estimate them with the help of simple valuation ratios, or more complex theoretical models and statistical analyses, or survey data [1].

All forward-looking indicators have their shortcomings and must be used with care. A few illustrations:

- Many stock-market-timers use the dividend discount model to assess prospective equity returns. Even when two investors agree that long-term market returns reflect the sum of starting yield and growth prospect, their estimates can diverge widely. One debate is whether to use dividend yields or broader payout yields that include stock buybacks and issuance. The disagreement on growth prospects is even worse. Anyone using analysts' earnings growth forecasts inherits the extreme optimism typical of analysts who often predict double-digit real growth over long horizons. Historical experience has been much more modest. Many investors can hardly believe that long-run real growth rates for earnings per share and dividends per share are between  $0\%$  and  $2\%$ , clearly lagging the trend growth rate for real GDP.
- Yield curve steepness is often used as a proxy for the reward for bearing interest rate risk. How on earth could the yield curve be inverted in the early 1980s when inflation was at a record high? To resolve the puzzle, recall that the yield curve reflects both risk premia and the market's rate expectations. When short-term rates are exceptionally high (1981) or low (2010), many investors expect mean reversion to more normal rate levels. This effect makes the curve exceptionally flat (1981) or steep (2010) when short rates are extreme and thereby contaminate the curve's information about the prevailing bond risk premium. Survey-based bond risk premia have given a better picture of the market's required reward for interest rate risk than has curve steepness; survey-based premia have trended up and down together with the inflation level.
- The credit spread of investment-grade corporates over Treasuries has averaged over 100 basis points in recent decades. Yet, index investors in corporate credits earned only about a quarter of this spread as realized excess return. Where did the rest of the yield advantage disappear? It turns out that the obvious culprit, default losses, made only a small dent on returns. The worst leakage was due to index investors' tendency to sell assets that leave the index and that tend to subsequently perform well, such as the BB-rated "fallen angels".

# 1.4 VIEW-BASED EXPECTED RETURNS

He fifth who chanced to touch the ear

Said, "Even the blindest man

Can tell what this resembles most;

Deny the fact who can,

This marvel of an elephant

Is very like a fan."

This book focuses on systematic sources of expected returns—reaping rewards for bearing risks that the market dislikes or exploiting common errors in investor judgments. Thus, it has little to say on view-based expected returns that are discretionary and inherently investor specific. Views on secular changes are especially important because such changes can trip contrarian investors. Even forward-looking value indicators are anchored to history; shifting anchors can thus cause persistent investment mistakes.

Many books try to understand the sources behind the value-added of superstar active managers. Unfortunately the skills of truly superior investors are hardly replicable. In the less rarefied world of ordinary active managers, nearly every view-taking investor subjectively expects the trade to be profitable. Yet we know that in the aggregate, active trading profits must amount to zero—and this is before subtracting costs and fees. Some investors are consistently successful, most are not. Realized value-added is easier to measure than prospective value-added.

If this book can help discretionary view taking only indirectly (by educating readers), can it perhaps help more in identifying superior investor subsets, investment approaches, or individual managers? To a limited degree, yes. I will quantify the past performance of some active investor categories and some systematic strategies but I stress the dangers in simply extrapolating past returns. Among investor subsets, the long-run performance of individual investor activity appears worst. Mutual fund managers as a group cannot cover their fees and the majority tend to lag passive indices. Hedge fund managers have a reasonably attractive track record even collectively but critics argue that returns may be overstated and reflect poorly understood risks. When it comes to individual managers, superior investors surely exist but identifying them in advance is a challenge. Performance persistence is limited, albeit stronger among alternative managers. Evidence on the impact of fund age and size on performance is mixed but more distinctive managers with relatively large active risks appear to outperform the index-hugging types [2].

Is this book relevant for designing long-term investment benchmarks or for active managers trying to beat them? Both. In a typical investment process, benchmark asset class allocations and portfolios are designed to reflect the investor's strategic (long-term) goals and constraints. The benchmark gives the ex ante "viewless" portfolio, or the natural place to stay, for investors who do not have tactical (short-term) views or who do not believe they can add value through active management. For active investors who try to outperform the benchmark, benchmark portfolio return is a neutral yardstick for ex post performance evaluation. This book's material is naturally relevant for making strategic decisions that could be coded in a benchmark but it also discusses tactical "beta-timing" tools. There are plenty of gray areas and fuzzy boundaries (see Section 11.4) [3].

# 1.5 GENERAL COMMENTS ABOUT THE BOOK

I have been a student of expected asset returns for over 20 years while wearing many different hats—in the buyside and in the sellside, in research and in trading. I have also advised institutional investors on their long-term investment strategies, and it is mainly this last experience that has inspired this book.

I aim to be broad and comprehensive, going well beyond equities which are the focus of most books:

- The book reviews a lot of historical evidence. Despite the book's empirical bent, it also provides a theoretical and practitioner perspective for interpreting and using the data. As usual, U.S. capital markets have the most comprehensive and often longest return histories, but I also present evidence from non-U.S. markets.
- The book focuses on long-term expected returns, although it also discusses tactical return forecasting of major asset classes and many active trading styles. Many books exist on short-term trading, portfolio construction, and risk management, but few on long-term expected returns. The most comparable existing works are *Triumph of the Optimists* by Dimson-Marsh-Staunton (2002) (DMS) and "Stocks, bonds, bills and inflation" by Ibbotson-Sinquefield (1976), as updated by Ibbotson Associates and Morningstar (2008) [4].
- Unlike many recent books, this one avoids a focus on the recent crisis—even though the crisis will undoubtedly cast a long shadow over markets. I hope that this book can be relevant for investors for years to come.

Given the diverse perspectives taken and asset classes covered, this book does not have just one key theme. Rather, it is a mosaic, reflecting the complexity of the real world. I will briefly discuss many theories and stories that together portray the ways that expected returns are determined, but I cannot give one coherent story. I am open-minded regarding the roles of rational and irrational influences on expected returns; indeed, both surely matter. Among the many theories and stories available, I emphasize the ones I find the most relevant, but my broader goal is to provide enough material and references to help a thoughtful reader make his or her own judgments [5].

The sixth no sooner had begun

About the beast to grope

Then, seizing on the swinging tail

That fell within his scope,

"I see," cried he, "the elephant

Is very like a rope."

Health warning: We should humbly recognize the limits of our understanding. Realized returns are dominated by randomness, structural uncertainty, and rare events. Expected returns are unobservable, at best estimated with noise. We should resist hindsight biases wired in us—the outcomes that materialized seem more inevitable or predictable than they truly were [6]. It is worth recalling that experts can only explain a fraction of realized return variation afterwards, and this is an inherently easier task than predicting. Any observed return predictability is mild, possibly spurious, and rarely robust. Therefore I stress humility in interpreting empirical results and even more in making predictions and in trading based on them.

My hope is that this book improves the reader's understanding of expected returns while not adding to overconfidence. With better understanding comes a healthy respect for investment risks. I do not denounce risk taking, since it is the main way to enhance long-run returns, but investors should choose carefully which risks to take and how much of each, accepting them mainly when they are well rewarded.

I review key investment takeaways in Chapters 28 and 29, but here is a one-paragraph summary: there are many ways to enhance long-run returns; several can be pursued in parallel. Investors should collect risk premia from diverse sources, not just equity premia but also illiquidity premia and value, carry, and momentum style tilts. Investors can further try to exploit leverage, contrarian timing, and view-driven active management—all of which can help when used with moderation. For various caveats and much more detail, see Chapters 28 and 29.

One contribution of this book is to take return measurement seriously. Estimating prospective returns is hard enough without misinterpreting available data. We need to evaluate critically the published historical returns of any asset class or strategy (chapters on equity premium, alternatives, and dynamic strategies focus on various biases and data problems). And when ex ante measures are available, we need to recognize their pitfalls (bond chapters stress the shortcomings of yields and spreads).

This book is long enough dealing with expected returns without venturing into the art and science of portfolio construction and risk management. Volatility and correlations are traditional building blocks in those endeavors. I touch on these topics insofar as they influence expected returns. Intriguingly, they do, through the monetized benefits of diversification and rebalancing (see Chapter 28). Leverage can improve effective diversification, besides helping investors avoid overpriced high-volatility assets. Diversification can also be enhanced by using the complementary perspectives of strategy styles and risk factors. For example, as value and momentum strategies tend to be negatively correlated, combining them gives much smoother returns than either style alone. Negatively correlated return sources are such powerful diversifiers that their usefulness should not be wasted. It is much harder to diversify away the directional equity market risk, as safe haven assets tend to be either costly or unstable.

Striving to build a bridge between academic and practitioner worlds, this book focuses on intuition and contains almost no equations and only very basic statistics [7]. For many academics the book will thus seem insufficiently rigorous, while for some practitioners it may be too intense. My target audience, unsurprisingly, is in the middle: experienced professional investors still hungry to learn, including top-down asset allocators and fund trustees—as well as advanced finance students in CFA or MBA programs.

# Outline

When designing the book's structure, I needed to find a compromise between discussing broad issues common to many asset classes and providing evidence on specific asset classes, strategies, or factors. I decided to do both, while trying to avoid repetition. Parts I and III are broad while Part II focuses on specific cases. As the book's structure is complex, the elephant and the cube may help as visual aids.

In Part I, the Introduction is followed by an empirical appetizer focusing on historical average returns (Chapters 2 and 3). Thereafter I present various key concepts as well as the theory of expected return determinants—both rational and irrational stories (Chapters 4 through 7).

In Part II, the main meat of this book (Chapters 8 through 19), I drill into the expected returns of 12 "cases": four asset classes, four popular active strategies, and four underlying risk factors. Figure 1.4 redraws the cube (from Figure 1.2, of three perspectives to investments: asset classes, strategy styles, and risk factors) with each side split into four parts according to the dozen cases. Besides the traditional asset class premia—equity, bond duration, and credit—I discuss a variety of alternative asset premia. The four active styles—equity value, currency carry, commodity momentum or trend, and volatility selling—have been popular because they have been among the most successful trading strategies in recent decades. There are many nominees for underlying factors; my subjective picks are growth, inflation, liquidity, and tail risks (volatility, correlation, and return asymmetry). I will show that all 12 investment approaches have enhanced long-run returns in the past. I believe that all of them will continue to deliver excess returns, albeit in a time-varying fashion.

While Part II discusses expected returns in the context of each distinct case, Parts I and III cover topics common to all or most cases. Recalling the analogy to the elephant parable, investors who study expected returns from a single vantage point can miss the big picture. To remedy this problem, Parts I and III try to shine light on expected returns from different directions (as visualized in Figure 1.5). As emphasized above, historical performance, theories, and forward-looking indicators are the most important systematic inputs.

Chapter topics in Part III include endogenous return effects; forward-looking value and carry measures; usefulness of survey data; tactical forecasting models; as well as seasonal, cyclical, and secular return patterns. The book closes with main investment lessons and two appendices: a section on world wealth (size of main asset classes) and a description of data series and data sources [8].

Given the book's ambitious scope, it may be too much to absorb in one reading. To allay this problem, each chapter is reasonably self-contained and the reader can cherry-pick the topics of interest.

Now, let us turn to Poet Saxe and this chapter's concluding reflections:

And so these men of Hindostan

Disputed loud and long,

Each of his own opinion

Exceeding stiff and strong,

Though each was partly in the right,

And all were in the wrong!

In an afterword, often omitted from recitations of his poem, Saxe reveals his hidden agenda: he is lampooning those (and there were many in his time) who engage in meaningless disputes about theology:

Moral:

So oft in theologic wars,

The disputants, I ween,

Rail on in utter ignorance

Of what each other mean,

And prate about an Elephant

Not one of them has seen!

There are enough theological disputes about finance and investing. Like many writers, I too have a preacher's passion, but I preach in an ecumenical church. This book stands against narrow-mindedness, inflexibility, and overconfidence in investing, and for humility, pragmatism, and diverse perspectives.

Despite such lofty goals, I hope you enjoy the read, learn a lot, and eventually find that the insights in this book make you a better investor.

# 1.6 NOTES

[1] I endorse greater use of survey data to help interpret market pricing. High stock market valuations could reflect optimistic cash flow growth forecasts or low discount rates while steep yield curves could reflect the market's view of rising short rates or a high required bond risk premium. Survey data can help make these decompositions if consensus forecasts are deemed representative of market views. Survey-based analyses of stock, bond, and currency prices often support irrational explanations for asset return predictability instead of time-varying risk premia.

[2] When discussing hedge funds (Section 11.4) I review the debates about alpha, (traditional) beta, and alternative beta as return sources. The boundaries are blurred. One definition of alpha is "the average return that cannot be explained by common risk factors." As more and more factors are added to models that explain fund returns, ever less scope is left for measured alpha. Yet, active managers argue that they are simply taking views against the market; if they are right they make money which should be deemed as alpha. Tensions naturally arise between these two mindsets. Investors into hedge funds are especially concerned about asymmetric strategies that involve selling various forms of tail risk insurance whose payoffs can look deceivingly alpha like. If the fund manager's "view" is that the stock market will not fall by more than  $10\%$  in any month (or that the real estate market will not fall in nominal terms or that yet another rare event will not materialize), even a manager without any forecasting skill can be profitable and collect fees for years before the tail event with large losses occurs.

[3] Every investing institution can debate (i) whether dynamic investment approaches—such as market timing, value tilt, or factor-based investing—are appropriate for it and (ii) whether these approaches should be coded in the benchmark or left for the active manager in the quest for outperformance. These questions are not so different from asking whether emerging market stocks, commodity futures, or hedge funds should be included in their allowable investment universe and even into the benchmark. The answers will certainly vary across institutions, depending on prior beliefs, resources, costs, and other considerations.

[4] These masterworks belong on every serious investor's bookshelf. Books by DMS and Ibbotson (including work with various coauthors) provide more underlying data than mine does; indeed, I use their data in some of my analyses. Both focus rather exclusively on historical average and period-to-period (say, annual) returns on traditional asset classes, though the authors have elsewhere expanded empirical analysis to other asset classes and investment strategies. My book distinguishes itself by its comprehensive coverage of asset classes and strategies as well as by its many perspectives to tackling expected returns. I also embrace "new" ideas, such as time-varying expected returns and investor irrationality, more than these other books do.

[5] Selectivity cannot be avoided. I emphasize some of my pet themes that are not yet part of the academic consensus, such as the impact of wealth-dependent risk aversion and lottery-type preferences on asset prices, the promise in market and/or factor timing, or the usefulness of survey data to assess real-time investor expectations. If any personal bias shines through more than the others, it is my preference for simple and liquid assets. Such assets are more transparent, often leading to better outcomes for end-investors. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, protecting investors against abuse.

[6] In competitive markets, realized returns reflect much more variability than expected returns. Yet, humans have a tendency to attribute any good past performance to skill or other persistent edge. We repeatedly get "fooled by randomness" when we equate ex post success with ex ante skills and underestimate the role of chance. This is true in many realms of life but especially with investing.

[7] Frustratingly for academic readers, I rarely show standard errors,  $t$ -statistics, or the statistical significance of my findings. This partly reflects my target audience, and partly my view that the time-varying nature of expected returns and various biases make standard statistical inferences inappropriate. I prefer to assess the consistency of a return series "in investment language" by reporting the Sharpe ratio (which is closely related to statistical significance) and by displaying cumulative performance graphs that I find particularly informative for experienced users.

[8] Personally, I love footnotes. I would also prefer to give too many credits and literature references in the text, explaining the intellectual history of each key idea. Finally, I was brought up to carefully document my data series construction. I have been advised that I am in a minority on all three counts. Thus, I try to shorten the book and improve its readability by minimizing notes (now "only" about 100 left), placing them at the end of each chapter. I make some references in the main text on the sources of ideas or empirical findings, but a longer list of references can be found at the end of the book. My data sources are only briefly listed under each exhibit, but Appendix B describes my data sources and data series construction in detail.

Source notes. Although I make some references in the main text, I leave most of them for the "Source notes' section at the end of each chapter. The reference section proper can be found at the end of the book. Given the wide-ranging topic of this book, even these source notes must be selective. On many topics, I refer to important recent works rather than to seminal works. Even if the new working papers are often specialized and have not been tested by time, interested readers can find in them references to both other recent works and the intellectual heritage of the idea.

Books closest to this work are Ibbotson–Brinson (1993), Siegel (1994), and Dimson–Marsh–Staunton (2002). This book is intended for professional investors and assumes much prior knowledge. For professionals wanting to learn about institutions, products, and analytical tools in diverse investment markets, I recommend the various handbooks edited or written by Frank Fabozzi. For retail investors, I recommend William Bernstein (2002, 2009), John Kay (2008), and Malkiel–Ellis (2010). Among finance textbooks, I recommend Bodie–Kane–Marcus (2008) for MBA level and Cochrane (2005a) for Ph.D. level, while the history of the interaction between academic and practitioner finance is best covered in Peter Bernstein's books Capital Ideas and Capital Ideas Evolving.

# Whetting the appetite: Historical averages and forward-looking returns

- I present some historical performance statistics for major asset classes and investment strategies, but I also highlight the pitfalls in using such data.
- Average returns across asset classes seem positively related to volatility and illiquidity. Bearing duration risk and emerging market risk were exceptionally well rewarded during the past 20 years, equity risk not.
- The results for 1990–2009 may be sample specific, reflecting an abnormally benign environment for certain asset classes. This problem can be mitigated by adjusting average returns for any windfall gains and by studying subperiod results and longer return histories.
- Historical average returns are particularly misleading measures of prospective long-term returns if expected returns vary over time and the past sample period includes a significant repricing. Forward-looking value indicators have their own limitations but are often superior proxies for expected returns.

Before delving into the terminology and theories of expected return determination in the next chapters, I provide some empirical appetizers. Chapters 2 and 3 focus on historical average returns over a 20-year window and over even longer windows. I emphasize the pitfalls in interpreting historical data. If you do study historical returns, as most investors do, this chapter reminds you of several skeptical questions you should ask.

I first summarize the performance of all major (and some minor) asset classes and a few exceptionally successful active strategies over the past two decades.

- The choice of my starting point (1990) is rather arbitrary, largely driven by data availability for certain strategies and factors. (Data for the principal asset classes go back much further.) Any such historical analysis is inherently sample specific, a problem for which I will suggest some remedies.
- One 20-year window gives only one historical data point to assess the prospects for the next 20 years. For any serious statistical analysis, hundreds of years of data would be needed. Chapter 3 turns to evidence over longer time spans, but data availability and quality deteriorate the further back we look, and structural changes may make older data irrelevant.
- Historical average returns can be especially poor proxies of future expected returns in a world with time-varying expected returns. I prefer ex ante measures of long-run expected returns, such as bond yields or earnings yields, and this point, indeed, is one of the key themes of this book.
- The reported returns may not have been achievable due to trading costs (which are especially significant for illiquid assets and for strategies with high turnover). Total nominal returns also ignore the detrimental impact of taxes and inflation.

Nonetheless, historical returns are a natural starting point of investment analysis, partly because humans are hardwired from prehistoric times to imitate successful actions and to learn from past experiences. Such hardwiring helped our ancestors survive and develop but it may work poorly or even be harmful in the domain of competitive modern financial markets. The disclaimer "past performance is no indication or guarantee of future results" seems overused but bears repeating because it goes against key evolutionary traits.

# 2.1 HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE SINCE 1990

Table 2.1 documents raw annualized compound average returns (nominal geometric means) and risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratios), as well as some risk statistics, for various investments over the period 1990-2009. The Sharpe ratio (henceforth SR) is the annualized arithmetic mean excess return over cash, divided by its annualized volatility; cash can be represented by the deposit rate (here) or by the Treasury bill rate (Chapter 3). Illiquidity estimates are subjective assessments of each asset's liquidity on a scale from 1 (liquid) to 5 (illiquid).

# Commenting on results for 1990-2009

- It barely paid to move from government bonds to either equities or to corporate bonds (i.e., the realized equity risk premium and credit risk premium were very low over this exceptional sample period).
- Global equities (the developed market index) even underperformed government bonds, dragged down by Japanese stocks whose bubble peaked just before our sample period started. Both U.S. and European stocks earned an annualized return over  $8\%$ , but Japanese stocks averaged  $-2\%$  returns each year.
- Among U.S. equity styles, small-cap value stocks fared best, while small-cap growth stocks fared worst.
- Emerging market equities and debt earned much higher returns than developed market assets.
- Duration risk was abundantly well rewarded, thanks to the persistent decline in yields. Global government bonds also benefited from diversification and earned the highest SR among traditional assets: 0.8.
- Corporate credit risk bearing was poorly rewarded. I will later return to one key exception, which is that buying short-dated (1-to-3-year) top-rated (AAA/AA) credits while shorting duration-matched Treasuries earned a high Sharpe ratio.
- Real estate markets ended up earning returns similar to those of stocks and bonds. Among other real assets, commodities and art underperformed while timber fared especially well.
- Actively managed venture capital, private equity, and hedge funds earned double-digit net returns, according to well-known indices (which may tend to capture the better performing funds and thus overstate industry returns).

Notes: Data-series descriptions and data sources are in Appendix B). All annualized total returns are shown in dollar (i.e., unhedged) terms, thus combining local currency asset returns with foreign exchange gains and losses. As one exception to unhedged returns, global government bond returns are currency-hedged into dollars (consistent with many institutional bond investors' habit of hedging the currency risk, in contrast to equity investors' practice of leaving the currency exposure unhedged). The returns of the quarterly sampled series are based on statistical estimates, appraisal values, or internal rates of return. The returns of active managers are net of fees but may still be overstated due to voluntary reporting and survivorship bias. The active strategies are briefly described in Section B.2 "Strategy style returns" and in more detail in Chapters 12-15.

Most series were obtained from the original source in total return form, but for the excess returns of self-funded active strategies, the Treasury bill return is added (even though I use the deposit rate for Sharpe ratio calculation), representing the return on cash collateral. No trading costs are subtracted from these simulated returns. To convert total returns to excess (real) returns, we can loosely subtract the deposit return or the bill return (or the inflation rate).

- Certain active strategy styles earned very high returns, especially until 2007. The last rows in Table 2.1 highlight four popular dynamic strategies that I will review in this book:

$\bigcirc$  Within equities, buying global value stocks (and selling "growth" stocks) has been a winning systematic approach, despite the pains in 1999 and 2007-2008.

In the FX arena, high-yielding currencies were the best performers, despite large losses in 2008. Carry-seeking long-short strategies—buying high-yielding currencies against selling low-yielding currencies—achieved a high SR. (I focus on G10 markets but the performance was even better in emerging markets.)

- Momentum style strategies across assets (buy recent winners, sell recent losers) and trend-following strategies for a single asset performed well in many asset classes, including the commodity space.
- Finally, selling volatility on equity index options was a highly lucrative strategy until autumn 2008, when a decade's worth of slowly earned gains were lost in two months. Our sample began soon after the 1987 crash and, despite many financial crises over two decades, no comparable tail event occurred until 2008.

# Relating average returns to volatility and illiquidity

You do not have to be an efficient market purist to believe that long-run average return differences across assets reflect ex ante required rewards for bearing risk and illiquidity. I now take a first look into the determinants of return differentials across assets, starting from the classic mean variance relation as it was manifested in 1990-2009.

Figure 2.1 shows that the relation between average returns and volatilities is positive and reasonably consistent:

- So, across asset classes, volatility has been historically rewarded. (The same is hardly true within asset classes.)
- The link is not exact—assets don't line up perfectly on the regression line—nor should it be. Certain asset classes faced headwinds while others benefited from tailwinds during this sample, and volatility is not the only driver of expected returns. Some asset classes also benefited from active management and reporting biases. In particular, the returns of the three best-performing asset classes may be overstated due to survivorship and other biases [1].

Deviations from the fitted line in Figure 2.1 can be justified by many reasons: all volatility is not equal. One key characteristic missed by volatility is liquidity. Over the long run, less liquid assets should offer some compensation for their higher trading costs and lower trading/rebalancing flexibility. This reward is not constant over time. Illiquid assets tend to underperform during financial crises when liquidity dries up. Thus, illiquid assets should compensate investors for both the illiquidity and the systematic tendency to underperform in bad times. Moreover, less liquid assets tend to exhibit smoothed or stale pricing, which reduces their measured volatility and their correlations with other assets. Both positive illiquidity premia and the understatement of risk in the denominator of the Sharpe ratio calculation imply that we should observe higher Sharpe ratios for less liquid assets. Figure 2.2 confirms such a positive relation, based on my subjective estimates of illiquidity (with scale from 1 to 5, with 1 most liquid and 5 most illiquid). This empirical relation was even more positive before 2008. Yet, the apparent positive relation between illiquidity and asset class performance may reflect other factors than liquidity besides the various biases noted above.

# 2.2 SAMPLE-SPECIFIC RESULTS: DEALING WITH THE PITFALLS

The choice of 1990 as a starting year is somewhat arbitrary. When selecting any historical sample period, we make a stark all-or-nothing choice as to what historical data are relevant, obtainable, and representative of the future [2]. We effectively assume that the sample period is "neutral" with positive and negative unexpected surprises just washing out, without one-off windfall gains from changing valuations, and with just as many rare events occurring during the sample as the market had been expecting. We also rule out structural changes within the sample, time-varying expected returns, and systematic reporting biases. Do you still think the numbers in Table 2.1 are useful for forecasting after all these qualifications?

I mitigate the sample specificity of historical analysis by:

- using three endpoints (2009, 2008, and 2007) that give very different results:
- reviewing empirical evidence before 1990 for asset classes where good-quality data histories extend further back:
- adjusting average realized returns for sample-specific windfall gains from changing asset valuations:
- showing cumulative performance charts that illustrate subperiod fluctuations in asset returns since 1990.

# Contrasting different endpoints, 2009 vs. 2008 vs. 2007

Figure 2.3 shows that the historical reward to risk was even more perverse at the end of 2008 than at the end of 2009. Equities barely outperformed cash and clearly lagged longer Treasuries. Going back to 1990-2007, equities were still ahead of bonds but only modestly so when compared with longer histories. The lesson is that the selection of the sample period can matter a lot. Endpoints (or starting points) are especially misleading if they coincide with bubble or bust valuations (say, 2000 or 2008 for equities). The end of 2009 was fortunately a reasonably neutral period from the valuation perspective.

Figure 2.4 contrasts long-run historical Sharpe ratios at mid-2007 and at end-2009. The 2008 carnage did real damage to many risky assets, despite the 2009 recovery. Global equities, credits, and commodities had not had particularly good SRs even between 1990 and the first half of 2007, but after the 2008 turbulence these SRs fell below 0.2. Private equity funds and (funds of) hedge funds, as well as real estate, had had high SRs but these all plummeted in 2008. The regression slope of long-run average returns vs. volatilities across numerous asset classes halved from  $0.4\%$  to  $0.2\%$  (not shown).

Up to 2007, embracing risk had especially paid off for strategies that resembled selling lottery tickets that pay off in bad times. Since really bad times did not materialize until 2007-2008, these skewed strategies performed so well that they attracted hot money, which further boosted returns:

- The archetypal strategy of this type is equity index volatility selling which profits from the normally steady gap between implied and realized volatilities. The strategy lost in September–October 2008 more than a decade's worth of profits. The long-run SR sunk from 1.3 to 0.4.
- The FX carry strategy and the aforementioned short-dated credit carry strategy also had SRs near 1 before the crisis and resemble a lottery-selling strategy; these too suffered dramatically in autumn 2008, and their SRs dropped.
- Not coincidentally, the hedge fund styles that gave the worst surprises in 2008 were also short financial catastrophe risk. Among the HFR hedge fund style indices, the largest declines in the long-run Sharpe ratio (not shown) were for convertible arbitrage (1.5 to 0.7), fixed income (1.5 to 0.9), and relative value arbitrage (1.9 to 1.3).

# Returns over longer histories (pre-1990)

Twenty-or-so years are an alarmingly short data window for forming views on long-term expected returns [3]. However, going back before 1990 would narrow the available set of asset classes—either no data or poor data quality in immature markets. Too long return histories also make it likely that we include data from a different regime (i.e., from before an important structural change). Despite these caveats, it is important to study long histories, and Chapter 3 thus contrasts the experience of the past 20 years with longer periods using extensive historical data.

Let us go back to Figure 2.3. On the left, the 20-year sample shows that global bonds outperformed stocks  $7\%$  vs.  $6\%$ . On the right, the 110-year sample shows that global stocks trounced bonds  $8.6\%$  vs.  $4.7\%$ . Which evidence do you give more weight to? The answer is not quite obvious because structural changes could make the recent past more relevant. However, a shorter history is also more likely to suffer from sample-specific effects, and I have already alluded to the secular yield decline and the Nikkei drag on global equities since 1990 [4].

# Adjusting for sample-specific valuation changes

The decades from the 1980s through 2007 were characterized by declining macroeconomic volatility and rising asset market valuations. The consequent windfall gains were presumably unexpected by investors; these gains boosted realized asset returns well beyond the ex ante returns that investors actually required. Government bonds benefited from this repricing more than most asset classes. I show next how to "neutralize a non-neutral sample" and adjust average returns to account for sample-specific (and presumably unexpected) changes in yields and risk premia.

U.S. Treasuries enjoyed great tail winds when market yields fell from over  $15\%$  in 1981 to  $8\%$  at year-end 1989 and then further to  $3.5\%$  at year-end 2009, thanks to lower inflation expectations and lower required risk premia on Treasuries. The cumulative windfall gains were roughly  $23\%$  (using the following approximation: yield decline of 4.5 percentage points times an average market duration of just above 5). Prorated to each of the 20 years, this repricing gain boosted the annual return of U.S. Treasuries by a tad over  $1\%$ . Without this repricing, the average annual return on U.S. Treasuries would have been  $5.8\%$  rather than  $6.8\%$  and the Sharpe ratio 0.32 rather than 0.53.

The emerging market debt spread over Treasuries fell from  $10\%$  in 1990 to  $3\%$  at the end of 2009, so these assets enjoyed even better tail winds. Depending on emerging debt duration, the average return was boosted by  $2\%$  to  $5\%$  by the repricing due to lower yields and spreads.

In contrast, U.S. corporate bonds and equities experienced mixed valuation changes during this sample period. Corporate spreads widened from  $1\%$  to  $1.5\%$  but yield levels fell together with Treasuries. The S&P 500 P/E multiple expanded from about 15 to 20 and dividend yield fell from  $3\%$  to  $2\%$ .

The above exercise of removing unexpected repricing gains should give us a better picture of what investors actually required ex ante during this sample period. The repricing-adjusted average return does not necessarily give us a good picture of what investors require now. Higher valuation ratios now would also mean that long-run expected returns are currently lower than their average during past decades.

The misleading nature of historical average returns is easy to see when we consider Treasury yields. Treasury investors understand that with current market yields below  $3\%$ , the high historical average return says little about future prospects. Repricing effects are much harder to see with other assets, such as equities, whose ex ante expected returns are less transparent and more ambiguous (see Box 2.1). Investors in equities and alternatives are thus more susceptible to naively extrapolating historical returns. When equity valuation multiples expand (and thus equity earnings yields fall), wishful investors hope that this change reflects rational expectations of faster future earnings growth instead of lower expected or required future returns. Empirical evidence suggests, however, that earnings yields are a better predictor of future equity market returns than of changing earnings growth rates.

# Box 2.1. Repricing effects (extract from my 2003 article in the Journal of Portfolio Management)

Bond investors understand better than equity investors the folly of extrapolating expected returns from past average returns drawn from a time when valuation levels have trended up or down. A rally—high realized returns—caused by falling discount rates will reduce feasible expected returns, rather than raise them. The example in Figure 2.5 shows that, between 1982 and 2001, 10-year Treasury yields averaged  $8.1\%$ , but the realized annual return was  $10.7\%$  because the downtrend in yields (from  $14.4\%$  to  $5.1\%$ ) added almost 3 percentage points of annual capital gains to the yield income. Using the  $10.7\%$  realized annual return or even the  $8.1\%$  average yield as an expected return proxy makes little sense now that the yield is  $5\%$ . The transparency of market yields prevents bondholders from harboring excessive return expectations after a long bull market. Figure 2.5 shows that the revaluation effect was even greater for equities. The earnings-to-price (E/P) ratio fell from  $12.4\%$  to  $4.0\%$  in 20 years; that is, the market paid 3.1 times more for a given amount of dollar earnings at the end of 2001 than at the end of 1981. This repricing explains almost 6 percentage points of the S&P 500's  $15.5\%$  realized annual return. Again the realized average return clearly exceeds the forward-looking return that was reasonable to expect in the 1980s, let alone now. Unfortunately, most equity investors may have focused more on historical returns than on forward-looking returns.

# Subperiod analysis

My preferred approach to studying return consistency across subperiods is to plot cumulative returns over time. Careful eyeballing of such graphs reveals performance for any subperiod of interest, especially if the graphs are in log scale so a given percentage return has the same impact irrespective of where it is on the Y-axis. Distinctions are even sharper if we subtract the common riskless return from all series and plot cumulative excess returns (cumulative outperformance over cash, here one-month deposit) (as in Figure 2.6).

Developed market equities enjoyed persistent rallies in 1993-2000 and 2003-2007 but lost about half of their value in 2000-2003 and again in 2008. Partly due to the Japan drag, the asset class ended up underperforming emerging markets, fixed income, and real estate. Emerging market equities gave investors a characteristically bumpy ride but delivered the highest returns. Fixed income returns were most stable, while real estate (in the U.S.) was the best-performing asset class between the mid-1990s and 2007 but then busted.

# 2.3 FORWARD-LOOKING RETURN INDICATORS

All historical return data may be beside the point if expected returns vary over time. One key theme in this book is that time-varying expected returns can make historical average returns highly misleading. The market's expected returns are unobservable. Yet, as I will show, forward-looking indicators, such as simple value and carry measures, can be useful proxies of long-run expected returns. They certainly give better signals than extrapolation of, say, past decade realized returns. In addition, there is mild evidence of long-run reversal patterns for certain asset classes—say, a decade with abnormally high returns on equities is more likely to be followed by a decade of below-average returns. Recall equity markets in 2000 following a two-decade rally when extrapolative expectations attracted many investors to invest just when expensive market valuations pointed to low prospective returns.

One common approach to estimating prospective returns involves relating current market prices to some sort of value anchor (one that can be as simple as historical average price, yield, or spread—or something more complex). The presumption is that market prices will gradually revert toward fair values that are proxied by such value anchors.

Carry captures an asset's income return over time or, more broadly, an asset's expected return if the capital market environment stays unchanged over time. Carry indicators are often related to value indicators but details differ.

A narrow use of the term "carry" may originate from borrowers, or those who are short an interest-bearing asset. The cost of borrowing, or of remaining short, is the interest rate (not the coupon rate, but the full yield to maturity including drift toward par). For investors carrying, or holding, a long investment position that is financed by borrowing, the carry of this self-financed position, or zero-investment position, is the difference between the yields of the long (investment) leg and the short (financing) leg. Most investments are income generating, providing yield-like returns, and investors typically prefer positive-carry trades. The term "(positive-) carry trading" refers to yield-seeking activities—buying high-yielding assets, financed by borrowing in low-yielding assets.

An expanded use of the term "carry" (to cover equities, commodities, etc.) includes any income return and other return (such as drift toward par, or roll up or down a futures curve; or broader payout yields to stock investors) that is earned when capital market conditions (such as the term structure level and shape) are unchanged. Note that, under this broader definition, carry is not always equal to income return or to yield, hence my use of the umbrella term "carry" to refer to all of these generically.

For equities, the earnings yield or earnings/price ratio (E/P)—the inverse of the price/earnings (P/E) ratio—is the most popular value indicator. The E/P is too broad a measure for income return because investors do not receive all earnings as income. The classic income return proxy, the dividend yield (D/P), is too narrow a measure because dividends are not the only way firms distribute cash to investors. (The dividend payout ratio has fallen since the 1980s, especially in the U.S., as many firms have replaced dividend payments with share repurchases.) For bonds, yield to maturity (YTM) or the internal rate of return is the traditional measure of value and income return. Yield spread is the classic relative value indicator in fixed income analysis, preferably adjusted for embedded options. Chapter 21 reviews these measures and their pitfalls.

Value or carry indicators are inherently narrow. Broader statistical forecasting models take into account many other sources of predictability in returns, such as momentum, volatility, and the macroeconomic environment. Another distinction is that statistical forecasting models typically have a short horizon, while value and carry signals give a longer term view on an asset's prospects. I will discuss some key predictors for equity market timing, duration timing, and credit spread timing in Chapters 8 through 10 and later drill into four specific predictability patterns in Chapters 12 through 15. Chapter 24 will give a slightly broader overview on forecasting models and dynamic trading strategies.

Figure 2.7 shows proxies of ex ante real yields of major U.S. asset classes over a very long historical period. Real yields are calculated as explained in Appendix B. Clearly, these yields vary a lot over time. If we take them at face value, the relative attractiveness

of different asset classes varies drastically over time, suggesting that value-oriented market timing or tactical asset allocation strategies can be profitable. These indicators have their own shortcomings, but empirical evidence indicates that they do have some ability to forecast long-term asset returns.

The message from these valuation measures in early 2009 was that corporate bonds were historically cheap and government bonds historically expensive, while equities and real estate were rather normally valued. These relations normalized so much during the year that by early 2010 no glaring market opportunities were evident.

There are of course many other ways to predict asset returns—to be discussed in Sections 8.6, 9.6, and 24.4—but the contrarian approach shows promise and at least seems to do better than extrapolating long-run past returns. For an example popularized by Robert Shiller and John Campbell, Figure 2.8 shows how well smoothed earnings

yields (the inverse of the P/E ratio, with 10-year average trailing earnings used instead of current year earnings, adjusted for inflation) have been able to predict subsequent multiyear equity market returns [5].

# 2.4 NOTES

[1] The venture capital (VC) asset class shows the highest average returns, perhaps partly reflecting various biases. (Moreover, PE fund and VC fund returns are based on internal rates of returns, so not quite comparable with the returns of other investments.) For anyone getting enchanted by the venture capital's  $16\%$  compound average return (and a higher arithmetic average return) between 1990 and 2009, I hasten to note that the annual return of  $39\%$  in the 1990s was followed by an annual return of  $-3\%$  in the 2000s.

[2] Even at best, historical means are just point estimates of expected returns that are subject to estimation error and in some cases also model error. Rebonato (2007) favors the use of Bayesian probabilities, which honestly reflect our uncertainty about expected returns, whenever conditions for using standard probabilities are not met. (In the Bayesian setting, estimation error is comparable with higher volatility.) Problems include time-varying expected returns, importance of rare events, a high ratio of forecast horizon to data history, and feedback loops (such as when observing past performance influences investors' asset demands and thereby future returns).

[3] If we make predictions of one-year returns, we may be able to make statistically significant inferences about excess returns using 20 years of historical data; whether such short-term forecasts are economically significant is a topic of debate. The Sharpe ratio is closely related to statistical significance. It is the ratio of mean excess return over its volatility, while statistical significance uses the same two variables plus sample size. (The standard error of a mean is  $\sigma / \sqrt{N}$  where  $\sigma$  is standard deviation and  $N$  is sample size. The denominator of a Sharpe ratio only includes  $\sigma$ .) Given a 20-year sample period, an asset's annual excess return is statistically significantly above zero if the Sharpe ratio exceeds 0.44 (i.e., the critical value of a two-sided  $5\%$  significance level is 1.95 and  $1.9 / \sqrt{20} \approx 0.44$ ). However, classical assumptions include an unbiased sample period, normally distributed asset returns, and constant expected returns—and the empirical validity of each of these is questionable. For example, if expected returns are not constant but vary over time, past average returns have less to say about future returns than do ex ante measures.

[4] Expressing the same contrast in Sharpe ratio terms, global bonds beat stocks hands down, 0.79 vs. 0.18, between 1990 and 2009, but global stocks beat bonds, 0.34 vs. 0.13, between 1900 and 2009. Note that the Dimson-Marsh-Staunton long history uses currency-unhedged bonds with very long maturities. Intermediate-maturity bonds tend to offer similar returns with lower volatility, and hedging the currency exposure has the same impact. Hedging poorly rewarded FX risk, avoiding the longest duration bonds, and diversifying across countries may give bonds a long-run SR similar to that of equities, 0.3-0.5. Any better SR for Treasuries probably reflects sample-specific yield trends.

[5] The predictive correlation of 0.55 may look impressive but long-horizon relations are often overfitted. Even if the relation is spurious, the high correlation of slow-moving indicators may have less investment value than fast indicators, with a correlation of only 0.10 over a one-month horizon (and thus an  $R^2$  of just  $1\%$ ; recall that explanatory power or  $R^2$  is just correlation squared), that offer many more trading opportunities. For readers who find these correlations low, I remind them that predictive correlations are always modest because realized short-term returns of risky assets largely reflect unpredictable news. A monthly predictive correlation of 0.10 is already a good basis for a profitable trading rule. Finally, this correlation—like the others presented in this book—is based on an in-sample fit and arguably overstates the investment value of the predictive correlation. A real-world investor in 1921 would not have known the full distribution of future earnings yields to come, while we know with hindsight that the series peaked at that time.

Source notes. This chapter's topics are discussed in more detail later in the book. The various works by Roger Ibbotson and Elroy Dimson, as well as their co-authors, are the best reference sources on historical returns.

# The historical record: The past 20 years in a longer perspective

- Any historical snapshot is sample specific. I try to put the experience of the 1990s-2000s in a longer perspective.
- Between 1990 and 2009, duration risk was well rewarded, credit and equity risk were not. Emerging Latin American equities, venture capital, and small-cap value stocks earned the highest average returns. Equity assets had modest SRs compared with various fixed income assets as well as active funds and strategies. Front-end Treasuries had the highest SRs.
- Asset return data from different sample periods are not really comparable even if the sample periods are quite long, but here are some empirical findings. Equities outperformed other asset classes; in particular, they outperformed bonds by  $4\%$  per year since 1900. Small-cap value stocks earned especially high returns, although trading costs reduced their paper advantage. The long-run reward for extending duration peaked at intermediate maturities at about  $1\%$ . The long-run credit premium was only  $0.3\%$  for investment-grade debt but over  $1\%$  for high-yield debt. Among rating classes, BB-rated debt—just below investment grade—performed best and CCC-rated bonds performed surprisingly poorly. Non-income-earning assets earned low long-run returns.
- The best long-run SRs were for front-end Treasury trades (that cannot be levered), high-turnover reversal strategies (before accounting for costs, which are substantial), short-dated credits, and active value/carry/momentum strategies. I require at least 30-year histories, so this comparison excludes hedge funds, private equity, timber, etc.
- Most of the analysis focuses on nominal returns but the last section presents evidence on real returns.

Although one of my key themes is to de-emphasize historical average returns when assessing prospective asset returns, I review asset return histories over 1990-2009 in considerable detail in this chapter. The purpose is not to use the historical returns as forecasts but simply to make the historical information available to the reader consistent. The choice of the 1990-2009 time frame was arbitrary, and was guided by the availability of data for a large spectrum of assets. In this chapter, I also contrast this 20-year experience with a longer history. Even such longer histories may have limited relevance in a world of time-varying expected returns.

as for longer histories back to the 1970s, 1920s, and even 1900 [1]. Table 3.1 dissects global equities, Table 3.2 turns to fixed income, and Table 3.4 to real assets as well as active funds and strategies. The data series and sources are explained in Appendix B. Because the length of the longer history varies across investments (rows), the last column shows the start year for each one. Health warning: Performance comparisons across rows can be misleading if different sample periods are used. One obvious reason is that each sample period may be associated with high or low inflation and short-term interest rate levels [2].

The reported returns may not have been achievable due to trading costs, the impact of which is greater for illiquid assets, or for active strategies with high turnover. Total nominal returns also ignore the detrimental impact of taxes and inflation.

# 3.1 STOCKS

Before dissecting equity market returns, let us recap the evidence on stocks vs. bonds, as made familiar by the works of Roger Ibbotson (with co-authors) as well as Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton. Figure 3.1 contrasts recent decades against a longer history. Bars show the 1990-2009 average returns for major asset classes, while the line shows average returns over a longer window. Only the values for the long sample are labeled. I use the same format in several of the graphs below.

Long Treasuries, corporates, and equities all earned average returns near  $8\%$  since 1990, smartly beating T-bills. Bearing duration risk was rewarded magnificently, while bearing further credit or equity risk was not. Small-cap value stocks were the best performers over both the short and the long history.

The history of the 1990s-2000s more closely resembles the 19th-century experience than it does that of the first nine decades of the 20th century. In the former, fixed income earned relatively high real returns and equities offered only a slim advantage over bonds, while earlier in the 20th century, stocks beat bonds by large margins. However, it bears repeating that the high realized returns of long-duration bonds in the past 20 to 30 years reflect windfall gains from the trend of falling yields.

For an even longer and more global perspective, Figure 3.2 plots (in log scale) Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton's world equity and bond returns since 1900. Over the long haul, equities handily beat fixed income. Global long bonds underperformed short-dated bills until 1990 due to capital losses from both rising yields and depreciation of non-U.S. currencies against the dollar. The graph also includes the interesting history of Japanese equities. After four decades of success (1900-1939, including strong performance during the Great Depression), investors in Japanese equities lost nearly everything after World War II, then recouped these losses and much more between the 1950s and the 1980s, and then faced the two "lost decades" after 1989. Still, the experience of Japan and, even more clearly, of Germany reminds us that hyperinflations can fully destroy fixed income wealth while leaving equity holders with a real nest egg.

Emerging market equities outperformed developed market equities since 1988 (when MSCI emerging market indices began) but they underperformed between 1976 and 1987 so badly that over the full 1976-2009 period for which Dimson-Marsh-Staunton (2010) have emerging market data, they lagged developed markets (9.5 vs.  $10.5\%$ ). Among regions, Latin American stock markets were by far the best performers in the 1990s and 2000s, partly because their valuations were so cheap after the 1980s' debt crisis. Japan lagged, having been the world's best performer from 1950 to 1989; our sample period begins just at the peak of the Nikkei bubble. Over the 110-year window, U.S. equities unsurprisingly earned the highest returns among major markets.

Figure 3.3 turns to U.S. industries. Over the past 20 years, energy and manufacturing offered the highest returns, but since 1926 the health sector performed best. Moreover, there is no obvious relation between industry volatilities and average returns.

The relative performance of both countries and industries, even over relatively long samples, seems to reflect period-specific developments. History simply tells us what happened in the past, with no information about what is likely to happen in the future. Thus, country-specific and industry-specific exposures are good examples of systematic risks that may not warrant any significant risk premium. That is, even if all stocks in the same country or in the same industry tend to move together, expected stock returns across countries or industries may not systematically differ—unless some countries or industries exhibit other characteristics that confer an expected return advantage on them.

Value and size are the best known stock characteristics that are related to cross-sectional differences in average returns. Figure 3.4 shows that the average return ranks of the six size-sorted and value-sorted Fama-French portfolios are the same for the 1990-2009 and 1926-2009 periods (see the definitions of equity styles in Chapter 12 and Appendix B). Small-caps beat large-caps and value stocks beat growth stocks, on average. The small-value sector is thus understandably the best performer. Small-growth stocks—the proverbial lottery tickets—had the lowest average returns.

Table 3.1 shows that, on paper, momentum strategies fared even better than value, and short-term reversal strategies did even better. It is no coincidence that we find the highest gross returns in small-cap stocks and in high-turnover strategies such as short-term reversal and medium-term momentum. Recall that the numbers here exclude transaction costs, which would be substantial for these strategies. Incorporating trading costs would eat seriously into these paper gains. Ghayur et al. (2010) estimate that—net of costs—value and momentum strategies earned similar long-run returns. Others estimate that the double-digit gross returns of the short-term reversal strategy would have been negative after costs.

For evidence on the long-run stability of these relations, Figure 3.5 plots decade average returns over time. The graph shows long-short strategy returns (implicitly assuming that no net capital is invested), while in the table a cash return is added for style factors and active strategies (implicitly assuming the presence of cash collateral).

The average market premium was negative in  $15\%$  of these decade-long windows. Value and momentum strategies were even more consistently successful than investing in the overall market, earning negative returns only  $4\%$  and  $10\%$  of the time. The size premium fared the worst, with  $32\%$  of decade-long returns being negative. Excluding small-growth stocks from the small-cap universe would cut this fraction to  $20\%$ .

# 3.2 BONDS

Table 3.2 analyzes fixed income assets from various perspectives. The first point to note is the generally high level of average returns and SRs during the 1990-2009 period. The tail winds from falling yields were exceptional and color all the performance statistics. Table 2.1 showed that emerging market debt outperformed all the assets in Table 3.2, earning double-digit returns (11.5\%) but due to the short histories available for this market sector, I will not study it further.

Hedged global government bonds had an SR near one, partly due to the yield decline, but also because they enjoyed several structural benefits. Diversifying across several countries, hedging away volatile currency risk, and holding intermediate-duration rather than long-duration bonds all help reduce volatility. Adjusting for the annualized gains from sharp yield falls between 1985 and 2009, the SR for hedged global government bonds would be close to 0.5 instead of the 0.85–0.99 in Table 3.2, but this is still far higher than the 0.11 SR documented for a composite of unhedged long-duration bonds since 1900. Among major markets, German bonds fared the worst. Interestingly this is not due to the 1923 hyperinflation (because both the long holding of bonds and the implicit short position in bills lost everything, so these netted out in the hedged return). Currency hedging will be explained in Section 4.4.

Looking across investment-grade fixed income sectors in the U.S., corporates earned the highest returns between 1990 and 2009, while mortgages and agencies earned the highest volatility-adjusted returns. The new sector of asset-backed securities (and even newer commercial mortgage-backed securities for which data only exist since the late 1990s) gave the worst returns. Over long histories, long AA corporates outperformed Treasuries by  $0.3\%$  since 1926, while junk bonds outperformed Treasuries by about  $1\%$  since 1953.

Figure 3.6 assesses the reward for duration extension. For the 20-year sample, average returns rise steeply and monotonically with maturity. This period is unrepresentative and misleading for assessments of future returns as the downtrend in yields benefited all bonds but not evenly; for obvious reasons it benefited longest duration bonds most. Despite unexpected windfall gains, longest duration bonds have clearly lower Sharpe ratios than short-dated bonds, because of the higher volatility of long-dated issues. The SRs above one for short-dated issues reflects the fact that the excess return used for computing the SR is in excess of the one-month bill rate, at which only the U.S. Treasury can borrow.

Over a longer sample period, the reward for duration extension is more meager. If average returns were plotted vs. maturity, duration, or return volatility, the long-run relation would look more like a hockey stick, rising steeply into the 2-to-5-year range before tailing off. The period on which I focus (1952-2009) is driven by data availability—1952 is the first year for which we have return data for several maturity buckets. Conveniently, this data period also starts just after the episode during and after World War II when Treasury yields were regulated and were kept artificially low. Moreover, this period is broadly neutral in that yield levels were similarly low at the start and end of the sample. Later starting dates would imply windfall gains to bonds, just as we see for 1990-2009.

Figure 3.7 assesses the reward for bearing credit risk. Average returns are modestly better for investment-grade (IG) credits than for Treasuries, and much better for

Interestingly, the BB-rated sector, the first speculative rating notch, gives the highest long-run return over both the 20-year sample and the longer period. Just as with average yield spreads, there is a distinct kink in returns when moving beyond the IG threshold. The likely explanation is that many investors are restricted from holding non-IG bonds; the

related selling pressure makes BB-rated "orphan" bonds structurally cheap. Indeed, more recent data suggest that "fallen angels"—HY bonds downgraded from IG—outperform original issue HY bonds (9.6 vs.  $5.7\%$  in 1997-2009). B-rated bonds still provide quite decent long-run returns but CCC-rated junk bonds have a poor long-run record, partly due to their high volatility and possible lottery ticket status.

The 1990s and 2000s were benign for all fixed income due to the falling yield trend, but in a relative sense many "spread products" (bond market jargon for issues exposed to credit and/or prepayment risk, selling at a yield spread over comparable duration Treasuries) did not fare as well as the total return series imply. Total returns also reflect yield level changes, and corporate bond indices benefited from their slightly longer duration than Treasuries amidst falling yields. Option-adjusted spreads and excess returns are better measures of spread products' ex ante and ex post return advantage over comparable duration Treasuries. Such data are available since 1989. The realized duration-adjusted excess return for IG credits was  $0.2\%$ , compared with the  $0.6\%$  total return edge. At the same time, HY bonds had a true (duration-adjusted)  $1.7\%$  excess return over Treasuries, but even HY bonds' cumulative advantage dropped to negative levels in 2002 and 2008.

Table 3.3 explores the degree to which various spread products really captured their ex ante yield advantage. Between 1990 and 2009, the Barcap (formerly Lehman) U.S. corporate index had a much wider average yield spread than agencies or mortgages; yet it earned a slightly lower realized return advantage (over Treasuries) than either of these two bond categories. Corporates' spread capture, defined as the ratio of the ex post return spread to the ex ante yield spread, was a poor  $21\%$  (27 bp excess return vs. 129 bp average spread). Where did the remaining 102 bp go? About 20 bp of the "missed" return can be explained by the 75 bp spread widening, the rest by default and downgrading biases and by index investors' poor selling patterns described in Chapter 10. (For the more benign 1990-2006 period, over which the corporate spread narrowed slightly, the spread capture was a still modest 44 bp of the 104 bp average spread.)

In contrast, U.S. agencies' fixed rate debt delivered even more than their 33 bp average spread; their spread capture exceeded  $100\%$ . There were no credit losses because, in the end, it was decided that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were too big to fail. Mortgages captured only  $40\%$  of their 69 bp average spread. This may appear surprising because the spread over Treasuries narrowed during our sample, but the short embedded option in MBS really hurt when prepayment speeds and interest rate volatility rose.

The last rows in Table 3.2 compare total returns across ratings and maturities. The combination of abundant duration reward and consistent credit reward gave high-rated 1-to-3-year credits an SR of 1.2. If we purge the duration effect, excess returns over duration-matched Treasuries are less impressive but still smoother than for long credits.

The thick line in Figure 3.8 illustrates the poor reward to risk from generic nongovernment risk taking in the 1990s and 2000s. At short maturities the excess returns were consistent until 2008. Duration extensions were very profitable thanks to the falling yield trend. Most active fixed income managers selected credit overweights rather than duration overweights as their preferred structural tilt, which gave them a rollercoaster ride in 2008-2009.

# 3.3 REAL ASSET INVESTING AND ACTIVE INVESTING

The last performance table, Table 3.4, looks beyond equities and debt into various "real" assets as well as active funds and strategies. Among real assets, timber and crude oil futures earned the highest returns in the 1990s and 2000s. The three spot commodity price series as well as housing and art earned lower returns partly because they include no income [3].

The active funds and strategies that I study here had relatively high returns, perhaps overstated by selection biases. The SRs of illiquid assets are further boosted by understated volatilities. Data issues notwithstanding, venture capital had the highest return and HFs the highest SR between 1990 and 2009. VC suffered a  $67\%$  drawdown since its 2000 peak, coming soon after a  $280\%$  gain in 1999, and remains deeply underwater. The HF index produced much more consistent profits, with only two double-digit drawdowns (1998 and 2008). The active equity value, FX carry, and commodity

momentum strategies had impressive SRs even in the simple baseline variants I describe. These SRs could have been boosted further by diversifying each style into other asset classes; but incorporating trading costs would have reduced the SRs. The commodity trend strategy had a high long-run return partly due to double-digit volatility and higher trading costs.

Figure 3.9 shows that most real assets could not match stock or bond market performance after 1990 but outperformed bills. Looking back to 1978, real assets earned "bond-like" returns (U.S. bonds earned  $8.5\%$ ).

The histories I have for real asset returns do not date further back than the 1970s. Yet, secular trends may be especially important in driving real assets' long-term returns. Figure 3.10 shows the real (inflation-adjusted) price-only return for several real assets starting in 1920. Long-run real price growth was fastest for the stock market  $(2.7\%)$ , beating houses  $(0.8\%)$ , oil  $(1.1\%)$ , and gold  $(1.7\%)$ . Stocks' advantages are further boosted by their dividend income, which is ignored in this exhibit. (Nor are the rental income return from housing or the roll and margin returns of commodity futures accounted for in this exhibit.)

# 3.4 FX AND MONEY MARKETS

I focus above on dollar-denominated returns. The returns on non-dollar assets are mostly reported unhedged, in which case their dollar return includes the appreciation or depreciation of the foreign currency during the sample period. The returns on some foreign bonds are reported currency-hedged into dollars, in which case their dollar return also reflects the hedging cost, which is proportional to the money market interest rate differential across countries. Figure 3.11 shows that most G10 currencies appreciated against the dollar between year-end 1989 and year-end 2009. The Japanese yen spot exchange rate strengthened the most, by  $2.2\%$  per annum (cumulatively  $54\%$ ), which enhanced Japanese assets' dollar returns. Currency hedging would have boosted these assets' dollar returns even more because the hedger would have benefited from Japan's low interest rates (on average  $2.7\%$  lower than U.S. money market rates); thus the hedged investor would have netted an additional  $0.5\%$  per year. A pure currency investment into the yen mildly underperformed U.S. deposits (reflecting the net of spot rate appreciation and the average interest rate differential). Cash investments denominated in the currencies of all G10 markets other than the United States outperformed U.S. deposits. High-yielding currencies earned the highest average returns as their yield advantage was amplified by net currency appreciation. Many economists would consider this a surprising outcome because a high yield is usually interpreted as compensation for high expected inflation, which causes currencies to depreciate—not appreciate. However, during this period the high yields attracted capital and caused currency appreciation, while the feared inflation did not materialize. Carry strategy profits were not riskless, however; during financial crises the high-yielders suffered and the yen served as a valuable safe haven (see Chapter 13).

The near-monotonic link between average returns and average yields in Figure 3.11 is not evident if I redo the analysis with available G8 data since 1971 (when the Bretton Woods system collapsed); the high-yielding British pound and Australian dollar earned average returns similar to those of the low-yielding Swiss franc and Japanese yen. However, this approach only looks at long-run average yields to determine the results from holding static positions for decades; more dynamic currency carry strategies did make money between 1971 and 1989 as well as thereafter. Still, it is fair to say that the currency carry strategy benefited from tail winds in the 1990s and 2000s.

Figure 3.12. Money market spreads over one-month Treasury bill, 1965-2009. Sources: Bloomberg, St. Louis Fed.

Average returns for one-month Treasury bills and one-month deposits between 1990 and 2009 are  $3.8\%$  vs.  $4.5\%$ . The 70 bp yield advantage, called the "TED" or Treasury-eurodollar spread, reflects credit and liquidity differences. Historically, the TED spread was narrow and stable for two decades until 2008 (see Figure 3.12). Money market credit spreads blew out in 2008 to levels not seen since 1982, and it is more impressive to see 200 bp to 300 bp spreads when Treasury bill rates are near  $1\%$  than when they are near  $10\%$  [4].

The average yield spread of private money market paper—whether repos (RP), commercial paper (CP), certificates of deposit (CD), or eurodeposits (ED)—over Treasury bills (TB) more than halved between the 1980s and the 2000s, despite spiking back to the 1981–1982 level in 2008 (see Table 3.5). Between these extreme events, the major

It was a sign of the times that credit spreads widened only marginally following the September 11, 2001 terrorist strikes and the resulting temporary closing of some financial markets. As noted, there is a particularly attractive reward to risk when shifting away from short-dated Treasuries, but such opportunities cannot be arbitraged away by leveraged investors. Only the U.S. Treasury can fund at Treasury rates, while the holders of short-dated Treasuries can become less risk averse and more willing to accept non-Treasury risk. This indeed has happened—especially among central banks—resulting in significant spread narrowing and decline in the ex ante reward-risk tradeoff over time (until 2007). However, the 2007-2008 experience reminded investors that money market spreads widen at the worst possible times for financial institutions: during systemic crises. Only unprecedented central bank actions—"whatever it takes" was the motto—brought these spreads back down and caused a semblance of normality to return to financial markets.

Assets not covered in this chapter include many interesting cases with too short histories or poor data quality. Candidates range from the obvious to esoteric: emerging market debt, inflation-linked bonds, convertible bonds, interest rate swaps, credit derivatives, various structured products, exchange-traded funds, catastrophe bonds, distressed debt, and carbon trading.

# 3.5 REAL RETURN HISTORIES

The results above focused on nominal returns, as does most of this book. To compensate for what some readers might find to be insufficient emphasis on real returns, Table 3.6 presents the compound average real returns for many assets, decade by decade for the 110 years, and also for the 19th century (actually the 98-year period from 1802 to 1899) where possible. For the data shown, the 1980s and 1990s were among the best decades for most asset classes, while the 2000s were among the worst.

Table 3.7 supplements the above with information about average real price-only returns (i.e., excluding income, which was an important if not dominant source of return for both stocks and bonds in early periods). In addition, the exhibit shows valuation indicators and macroeconomic indicators. All real series are deflated by consumer price inflation (CPI), except for the ex ante 10-year real yield which uses long-run inflation expectations (based on survey data in recent decades and statistical estimates earlier; see Appendix B).

# 3.6 NOTES

[1] Technical notes: I do not show arithmetic means, but the SRs are based on arithmetic excess returns divided by volatility. In contrast to what I do in Chapter 2, the excess returns and Sharpe ratios here use the return on one-month Treasury bills, rather than somewhat higher deposit rates, as the riskless rate. The latter time series is not available for very long histories and I want to keep the 20-year and long-history statistics somewhat comparable. Some of the long-run Sharpe ratios are based on annual data. I show US$ (i.e., unhedged) returns (except that foreign bonds are hedged in US$). For long–short portfolios, I cumulate only the excess return when computing geometric means, or GM (instead of taking the ratio of 1 + GMs of

the long and short subportfolios' total returns). I then add the bill return to convert these excess returns into total returns.

[2] The average riskless (Treasury bill) return between 1990 and 2009 was  $3.8\%$ . Average riskless rates for periods ending at the present (2009) are lowest for the shortest and longest sample periods. Any history starting between 1900 and 1931 or near 1990 has an average riskless rate close to or less than  $4\%$ , while any history starting in the 1970s has an average riskless rate of  $5.7\%$  to  $5.8\%$ . Any period starting between 1953 and 1982 has an average riskless rate over  $5\%$ .

[3] Readers may wonder how gold futures and spot earned the same average return in 1990-2009. Mechanically, the futures return includes the spot price change, roll return (as the futures roll up or down the term structure over time), and Treasury bill return (because actual gold is not bought, the cash can be invested into Treasury bills and used as margin in the futures exchange). In this case, the roll return for gold was typically negative (reflecting contango) and exactly offset positive cash income. For crude oil futures, the roll return was only mildly negative (and indeed was positive until 2004), so the average futures return is higher than the average spot price change.

[4] In 2008, money markets also started to more effectively tier rates among issuers; earlier most banks could borrow at the same LIBOR rate. Even LIBOR's benchmark role was increasingly challenged by the Is (overnight index swap) rate, which is effectively a collateralized rate, independent of a borrower's credit quality. The LIBOR-OIS spread widened sharply during the 2008 crisis, but later narrowed back to  $< 10$  bp.

# Road map to terminology

I briefly review many definitions, distinctions, relations, and pitfalls. (Readers looking for the "meat" may skip this chapter and later use it as a reference section, as needed. Readers only interested in empirical evidence may jump all the way to Part II.)

4.1. Constant or time-varying expected returns?
4.2. Rational or irrational expectations formation?
4.3. Return measurement issues.
4.4. Returns in which currency?
4.5. Risk-adjusted returns.
4.6. Biased returns.

The terminology used to describe expected returns can be confusing. For most assets, expected returns are uncertain ex ante but they are also unknowable ex post. This is in contrast to realized returns, which are knowable ex post but which do not reveal what investors expected [1]. Realized returns are only one of many needed clues for inferring what investors might have expected. Since we cannot directly observe market expectations of returns or rates, we must infer expected returns from empirical data, including market yields or valuation ratios, past returns, and investor surveys, and from models.

An exception is the expected return on a default-free, zero-coupon government bond. The yield on such a bond is the return that investors expect—and in fact receive—if the bond is held to maturity.

When reading about expected returns, it is important to distinguish between time series predictability—variation in the expected return for a given asset class over time—and cross-sectional predictability—variation in the return expected at a given point in time for various different assets (e.g., for individual stocks within the equity asset class).

# 4.1 CONSTANT OR TIME-VARYING EXPECTED RETURNS?

Empirical research in finance since the 1960s has focused on cross-sectional differences in average returns, giving much less attention to the possibility of time variation in expected returns. Until 10 or 20 years ago, most academics and finance textbooks routinely assumed constant expected asset risk premia. Given constant expected returns, the best way to estimate expected future return is to calculate the sample average realized return over a long sample period [2].

During the 1980s and 1990s, empirical and theoretical research on time-varying risk premia began to challenge the assumption of constant risk premia in stock and bond markets. At the same time, behavioral finance suggested that boom-bust cycles may reflect time-varying sentiment and aggregate mispricing. Textbooks and academic consensus gradually shifted away from using the historical long-term average equity excess return as the best proxy for the future equity risk premium.

When expected returns vary over time, historical average realized returns reflect (i) historical average expected returns and (ii) historical average unexpected returns. The latter part includes the impact of changes in expected or required returns. This item can dominate realized returns if valuations change meaningfully during the sample period—especially when the sample period is relatively short.

Adjusting historical average returns for past valuation changes only gives us an estimate of past average expected return, not necessarily current expected return. The problem of misleading historical average returns is compounded because current expected returns are lower after valuation increases. If expected returns vary over time, prospective expected returns reflect current starting conditions—such as valuation ratios—and not historical average conditions. For example, the decades during which equity market valuations increased (the 1920s, 1950s, and 1990s) ended with historically high trailing returns but low expected returns.

# 4.2 RATIONAL OR IRRATIONAL EXPECTATIONS FORMATION?

Rational expectations have been a key paradigm in economics and finance since the 1970s. Rational investors make forecasts that correctly incorporate all available information, leaving no room for systematic forecasting errors. Early studies assumed a stable structural model whose structure agents know. More realistic hypotheses allow agents to rationally learn about evolving economic structures. This learning process over time could explain apparently biased expectations (predictable forecast errors) in empirical data.

Behavioral economics and finance have challenged this paradigm. Fully rational behavior requires quite complex calculations from *Homo economicus*, prompting the alternative idea that investors exhibit bounded rationality—rationality that is limited by their cognitive resources and observational powers. Psychological biases predict specific systematic deviations from rationality (to be discussed in Chapter 6). Two of the main examples of irrational expectations are excessive extrapolation and insufficient adaptation. That is, many investors expect past multi-year trends to persist more than they do, while they also underreact to recent news.

# Box 4.1. Terminology: expected vs. required returns

I find the term "expected return" potentially misleading because "market expectations" sometimes hardly conform to what most people expect. An extreme example occurred during the tech bubble when surveys pointed to exceptionally high subjective expectations of future equity market returns while objective forward-looking indicators pointed to exceptionally low future equity returns, given that market valuation ratios were so high. More generally, persistent market rallies may raise subjective return expectations (due to extrapolation bias) while they reduce objectively feasible returns (due to higher market valuations). Behavioral finance suggests that subjective (hoped-for) return expectations may well be negatively correlated with rationally objective return expectations.

Traditional academic terminology is based on the concepts of market equilibrium and rational expectations. In equilibrium (i.e., if price is equal to value), the expected return on the market portfolio, the return forecast for the equity market or any other market, should equal that market's required return. The expected return determines how high a return the market can feasibly supply, while the required return determines how high a return market participants (as a group) demand (in order to hold the amount of an asset that is on offer, so that markets clear and all assets are held). As always, market prices adjust to balance supply and demand. For example, if all investors suddenly require higher risk premia, current market prices of risky assets must fall.

Time variation in objectively feasible future returns may reflect mispricing caused by irrational expectations or sentiment fluctuations—but its origins could also be fully rational, reflecting risk premia that are time varying due to variation in the amount of risk in the market or in market participants' tolerance for risk. In the latter case, using the term "required returns" or "required premia" seems more fitting than "expected returns" or "expected premia".

# 4.3 RETURN MEASUREMENT ISSUES

Expected returns need to be viewed over some time horizon, in some base currency, and using one of many possible averaging and compounding methods. For meaningful comparisons, consistent methods should be used. (I remind technically oriented readers that simple returns  $[P_{t + 1} / P_t - 1]$  are additive across assets but not over time, whereas continuously compounded returns  $[\ln (P_{t + 1} / P_t)]$  are additive over time but not across assets.) My empirical analysis will focus on monthly return data, denominated in U.S. dollars, and typically measured as annually compounded returns. Fortunately, the main results are robust to using other reporting conventions, so they tend to hold generally.

Returns can be expressed in various ways. Raw nominal returns may be deflated to real returns, and this is typically done using the realized "headline" consumer price inflation rate. For yields and for forward-looking estimates of return, a survey-based or other measure of expected inflation may be more appropriate if such data exist. (The Treasury/TIPS break-even inflation rate is an example of a measure of expected inflation that is market based rather than survey based. Chapter 17 discusses pitfalls with this measure.) For excess return (risk premium) estimation the question "premium over what?" must be answered; the default answer is to subtract the return of a riskless money market asset, such as the Treasury bill rate, from the raw asset return, to arrive at an "excess return" or return premium. Many other types of premia can, of course, be calculated.

An important distinction is between arithmetic and geometric average returns. For example, the arithmetic average of two successive returns of  $+50\%$  and  $-50\%$  is  $0\%$ , but the geometric average is  $-13\%$ $\{[(1 + 0.5)*(1 - 0.5)]^{(1 / n)} = 0.87\}$ , where

$n =$  number of periods  $= 2\}$ . Basic finance theory, including single-period Markowitz or mean variance optimization and the single-period CAPM, requires that one use arithmetic means (AM) as inputs. However, most investors are interested in wealth compounding and this is better captured by geometric means (GM, also called compound average returns or compound annual returns). When I present historical evidence I focus on GMs, which show realized buy-and-hold returns. An asset's GM is always lower than its AM, and the difference is larger for high-volatility assets. An excellent approximation of the relation between GM and AM is:  $\mathrm{GM} \approx \mathrm{AM} - \mathrm{Variance}/2$ . For example, given  $20\%$  equity market volatility, annual variance is  $4\%$  ( $20\%$  squared) so the difference between AM and GM is roughly  $2\%$ . For more on the AM-GM gap, see Box 28.1.

# 4.4. RETURNS IN WHAT CURRENCY?

Most of my empirical evidence is expressed as dollar-based asset returns. For non-dollar assets this practice bundles local currency asset returns and exchange rate changes  $\left[(1 + H_{\mathrm{LC}})*(1 + \Delta \mathrm{FX})\right]$  into unhedged return. (The same is true for dollar assets from a Japanese investor's perspective.) It is often better to unbundle the two parts of unhedged returns and make separate active decisions on asset and currency allocation. Currency hedging can be done in various ways—selling expected FX proceeds using FX forward contracts, funding foreign asset purchases with foreign currency deposits, or directly buying non-dollar-denominated futures contracts. All these approaches keep the capital (and expected income) currency-hedged, with low trading costs. Only unexpected profits or losses would be subject to FX risk but this is inherently a second-order effect.

Consider an example where the U.S. equity market falls  $5\%$  and the dollar weakens by  $5\%$  against the yen. An unhedged Japanese investor holding U.S. equities would lose roughly  $10\%$  in yen terms  $(-9.75\%)$  return). A currency-hedged investor would lose something closer to  $5\%$  but not exactly  $5\%$ . The currency losses would not be exactly zero because investors can typically hedge only the expected proceeds of their investment, leaving the unexpected asset return exposed to FX risk. In this example, dollar depreciation makes yen-denominated losses slightly smaller, giving the currency-hedged Japanese investor holding U.S. equities a total loss of  $4.75\%$  in yen terms. The FX gain of  $0.25\%$ $(-5\%)$  of  $-5\%$  is an order of magnitude smaller than the FX loss for an unhedged investor. (In contrast, if the  $5\%$  U.S. equity market fall had coincided with  $5\%$  dollar appreciation, the unhedged Japanese investor would have ended roughly flat  $(-0.25\%)$  return) in yen terms, while the hedged investor's losses would have grown to  $5.25\%$  in yen terms.) Shortening the hedging horizon tends to improve hedging accuracy because the volatility of unexpected returns is reduced.

International comparisons are sometimes made using local currency returns. This convention can be misleading if inflation rates and nominal money market rates systematically differ across countries. For example, a  $10\%$  nominal asset return is much more impressive in a country with an inflation rate of  $2\%$  than in a country with an inflation rate of  $7\%$ . Because real short rates have been closer together across countries than inflation rates, it has been relatively fair to compare real returns across countries. Arguably the cleanest cross-country comparisons involve using common currency

Table 4.1. Annualized average spot exchange rate appreciation against the USD over each decade

<table><tr><td></td><td>EUR (\%)</td><td>GBP (\%)</td><td>JPY (\%)</td></tr><tr><td>1970–1979</td><td>7.7</td><td>-0.8</td><td>4.1</td></tr><tr><td>1980–1989</td><td>0.2</td><td>-3.1</td><td>5.3</td></tr><tr><td>1990–1999</td><td>-1.4</td><td>0.0</td><td>3.5</td></tr><tr><td>2000–2009</td><td>3.6</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.9</td></tr></table> returns (say, unhedged dollar-based returns) or local returns in excess of a local money market rate. These local excess returns are approximately equal to currency-hedged excess returns because the cost of currency hedging (the forward-spot premium in currency markets) is, by arbitrage, directly related to the money market interest rate differential across countries. The relation between the forward-spot premium in currency markets and the short-term interest rate differential across countries is called "covered interest parity" and holds tightly for most currencies under normal market conditions. It follows that, for any investor, the currency-hedged return of a risky foreign asset is well approximated by the sum of the investor's home currency deposit rate and the foreign asset's excess return over the foreign deposit rate.

For global assets other than bonds, this book shows mainly unhedged dollar-based returns. Table 4.1 shows that the yen and the euro (or the Deutschmark before 1999) have tended to strengthen against the dollar in recent decades. The dollar's downtrend lowers U.S. assets' performance for many non-U.S. investors, while the returns of many unhedged non-U.S. assets have been augmented by currency appreciation.

# 4.5 RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS

Performance evaluation of any asset, strategy, or fund is increasingly done on returns that are somehow adjusted for the average risk taken. Adjustment for volatility is the most common risk adjustment, based on the logic that it would be "unfair" to compare, say, returns of  $4\%$  on two different assets with very different volatility levels. Specifically, the Sharpe ratio (SR) is the average excess return over the riskless rate of return (proxied, in practice, by a near-riskless money market asset) divided by the volatility of this excess return. The SR is a measure of volatility-adjusted or risk-adjusted return.

In the CAPM context, the optimal risky asset portfolio can be levered or de-levered through borrowing or lending of cash (i.e., short or long positions in cash). Investors can combine such cash positions with the optimal risky asset portfolio to reach any portfolio on the capital market line (which shows the maximum expected return for each volatility target). All portfolios on the capital market line have the highest attainable SR; in this sense maximum-SR portfolios are optimal. Conveniently, the SR is scale invariant (i.e., it cannot be increased by levering up the risky asset portfolio, while returns themselves—not adjusted for risk—can be [3]).

The SR has its shortcomings because all volatility is not equal. For example, since SR uses volatility as the risk measure, it ignores the distinction between systematic and diversifiable risks. According to classic portfolio theory, systematic risk such as equity market beta is more dangerous than idiosyncratic risk that can be diversified away. More modern critics point out that volatility does not distinguish between losses that occur in good or bad times or even between upside and downside surprises.

Another approach to risk-adjusted returns focuses on an asset's—or a strategy's or a fund's—contribution to portfolio risk as opposed to its standalone risk (a part of which is typically diversifiable). The classic Jensen's alpha is the intercept when regressing asset returns on equity market returns. More generally, alpha is the intercept of any risk factor model. Thus, alpha is risk-adjusted return where "risk" is some measure of the asset's contribution to portfolio risk. In the past 10 to 15 years, the Fama-French three-factor model—which contains size and value factors besides the market beta factor—has become increasingly popular among equity managers. Others use even more extensive multi-factor models including various industry and style factors for equities, another set of systematic factors for fixed income managers, and yet another set for hedge fund managers. Whatever risk factors are used, significant average loadings on any risk factor are viewed as evidence of a systematic risk tilt. As the number of factors increase, there is ever less scope for alpha (alpha being the return not explained by the various systematic factors included in the model).

Other risk adjustment methods also adjust returns for the higher moments of a distribution. (The mean—or expected return—and volatility are, respectively, the first and second moments of a distribution. The third and fourth moments measure the distribution's asymmetry and fat tails, respectively.) Yet other methods take into account varying liquidity characteristics, but none of these measures captures all the dimensions of risk.

# Box 4.2. Riskless return—no longer so clear

Short-dated Treasury bills are the traditional proxy for the riskless asset. Government debt issued in the government's own currency was long perceived as default free, thanks to a sovereign's taxation power and access to the printing press. Recently, markets have begun to reassess the risks of inflation, sovereign default, and currency depreciation in supposedly riskless assets. Inflation-indexed ("real") bonds are now available to eliminate inflation risk but they leave the investor exposed to default risk as well as FX risk for foreign buyers. The depreciation of the dollar since 2001 has made Treasuries anything but riskless for their main holders, the Asian central banks. At least the prospect of outright default seems more remote for the U.S. than for many other countries. The fewer chances a fiscally stretched government has to inflate, or devalue its debt through a depreciating currency, the greater is its temptation to default. In most countries, government bonds still have the lowest yields, but it is no longer unthinkable to see government yields rising above high-quality corporate yields. Indeed, even in developed markets, long-dated interest rate swaps are increasingly trading below government yields, and sovereign credit default swap spreads have dramatically increased since 2008.

The time horizon also matters. Long-dated Treasuries are arguably a more natural riskless asset for long-horizon investors, given the uncertain reinvestment rate for short-dated bills. Pension funds match their liabilities best by buying long-dated real or nominal bonds.

# 4.6 BIASED RETURNS

For many asset classes, returns may be positively or negatively biased over a given historical sample. For active asset managers with voluntary reporting, published returns are almost certainly upward biased. Section 11.4 reviews a host of selection biases such as survivorship bias and backfill bias in the context of hedge fund return databases, but similar caveats apply to the reported performance of other managers. Backtested results of active strategies also suffer from overfitting and data-mining biases, which also overstate published returns.

Whenever we observe exceptionally attractive historical returns, it is healthy to adopt a skeptical approach. The financial industry has limited incentives to emphasize this needed skepticism beyond printing required disclaimers, while our innate tendencies for extrapolation and optimism make most of us too easy prey for the upbeat marketing of past performance.

# 4.7 NOTES

[1] The distinction between realized (ex post) and expected (ex ante) returns should be crystal clear. Ex ante is Latin for "before the event", ex post is Latin for "after the event". Unfortunately, unevenly applied terminology can cloud the issue. For example, "high equity premium last year" sometimes refers to realized equity market return over cash or bonds. I prefer to use the term "realized excess return" instead—and only keep the word "premium" for ex ante measures.

[2] Long data histories are necessary to make statistically significant inferences of one-year returns, even assuming constant expected returns and no structural changes (see Note 3 in Chapter 2). Assessing the statistical significance of multi-year horizon returns would require much longer data histories.

[3] Sharpe ratio and relative return investors: The information ratio is the benchmark-oriented relative return manager's counterpart to an absolute return manager's Sharpe ratio. Information ratio is the mean excess return of a portfolio vs. its benchmark, divided by the tracking error (i.e., volatility of that excess return). Sharpe ratio is sometimes computed as the ratio of total return and its volatility, which is plain wrong; the return on a money market asset should be subtracted from total returns. The ratio of total return and its volatility is sometimes called the information ratio for hedge funds, on the premise that their benchmark is zero (motivated by the absolute return mandate).

# Rational theories on expected

# return determination

- New academic views on expected return drivers are more complex—and more realistic—than the neoclassical CAPM-and-efficient-markets view.
- Expected return differentials across assets reflect rational risk premia as well as market inefficiencies and supply-demand effects.
Instead of a single equity market factor, many rational risk factors as well as liquidity and skewness characteristics appear to influence expected asset returns.
- Risk premia are higher for assets or factors (e.g., equities, carry strategies) that fare poorly in bad times, whereas safe haven assets (e.g., government bonds) may even have negative risk premia over cash.
Expected returns can vary over time due to rationally time-varying risk or risk aversion and due to investor irrationality and sentiment.
- The efficient markets hypothesis has been challenged by various anomalies and financial crises but its main implication—that beating the market is very difficult—remains valid for most investors.

This chapter reviews the revolution in academic thinking about expected returns. Twenty-five years ago the consensus assumptions included

- a world with a single risk factor—the asset's sensitivity to the equity market (i.e., the CAPM beta);
- constant expected returns over time;
- investors care only about the means and variances of asset returns;
- frictionless markets; and
- efficient markets/rational investors.

The current view is more complex but also more realistic. There are

- multiple risk factors (whose required rewards ultimately depend on their covariation with "bad times"); time-varying risk premia;
- skewness and liquidity preferences (liking lottery tickets and liquid assets):
- supply-demand effects on asset prices; and
- market inefficiencies (due to investor irrationalities and/or market frictions).

Behavioral finance and investor irrationalities will be discussed in the next chapter. In case you are a practitioner thinking that rational investor models are irrelevant or obsolete, you may be tempted to skip this chapter and move directly to the next chapter.

Do this at your peril. You will miss many insights about the drivers of expected asset returns—which I try to make as palatable and practitioner friendly as I can. By reading both chapters, you may also find that the debate between the efficient market camp and the behavioralists remains healthy and has deepened our understanding of financial markets. Certainly, neither side has a monopoly on "the whole truth".

# 5.1 THE OLD WORLD

At the core of finance is always the present value relation that an asset's market price should equal its expected discounted cash flows. Investors set prices so that the marginal cost of an asset (its price) equals its expected marginal benefit (its expected discounted future payoff):

$$
\operatorname {P r i c e} _ {t} = \sum_ {T = 1} ^ {\infty} E _ {t} \left[ \frac {\text {C a s h f l o w s} _ {t + T}}{(1 + \text {D i s c o u n t r a t e}) ^ {T}} \right] \tag {5.1}
$$

There are different types of expected cash flows. The most common are promised coupons and principal payments of bonds, and dividends of equities:

- Government bonds are typically assumed to be default free; thus their expected cash flows equal promised cash flows. Other bonds have uncertain cash flows that may reflect the possibility of default (corporate bonds) or the future path of interest rates (mortgage-backed securities or floating rate notes), for example.
- For equities, the sum of expected cash flows crucially reflects the expected growth rate of dividends (or other cash distributions to the shareholder).
- Although equity cash flows continue in perpetuity and bonds may have very long maturities, this equation applies even without long holding periods. Since the next period's asset price should be priced in a similar fashion, the current price reflects the expected discounted sum of next period cash flow and next period market price.

However, the main topic of this book is the denominator of equation (5.1). At the market level, discount rates are just another name for expected returns. In equilibrium (i.e., if prices are fair), the discount rates investors require for holding assets are the expected returns they can rationally anticipate. Equilibrium market prices are set by supply and demand among investors applying equation (5.1).

The discount rate or the expected return contains both compensation for time and compensation for risk bearing. The return on the riskless asset reflects only the former; short-term Treasury bills are typically used to measure this riskless rate of return (in nominal terms). The expected excess return of a given asset over the riskless rate is often called the (ex ante) risk premium of that asset.

In the pre-Markowitz world, even uncertain cash flows were often discounted using the riskless discount rate. This approach implicitly assumes a zero-risk premium—a special case that applies only in an unrealistic world of risk-neutral investors. Understanding the various risk premia—"what influences expected asset returns or discount rates beyond the riskless rate?"—has been the main question in academic finance for the past 50 or 60 years. The capital asset pricing model (CAPM), originated by Sharpe, Lintner, Mossin, and Treynor, was the profession's first answer and, for a long time, the principal one [1].

The CAPM can be based on various sets of assumptions. I will not derive it formally here but show one traditional set of assumptions (that can later be relaxed):

- one-period world (this implies a constant investment opportunity set and constant risk premia over time);
- access to unlimited riskless borrowing/lending and tradable risky assets;
- no taxes or transaction costs (i.e., frictionless markets);
- investors are rational mean variance optimizers (only caring about means and covariances can be motivated by normally distributed asset returns or by a quadratic utility function); and
- investors have homogeneous expectations (all agree about asset means and covariances; all investors see the same picture).

These assumptions ensure that every investor holds the same portfolio of risky assets, combining it with some amount, positive or negative, of the riskless asset (this latter amount depends on the specific risk aversion of a given investor). Moreover, these assumptions lead to the conclusion that the holdings just described are optimal. Finally, in equilibrium, market clearing requires that the risky asset portfolio demanded in common by all investors equals the market portfolio of risky assets.

The CAPM's asset-pricing implication is that assets with a higher sensitivity to the market [2] should offer a higher expected return—see equation (5.2), which is a simple rendition of the CAPM. Why? Investors require compensation for the risk each asset contributes to their portfolio—not for accepting an asset's standalone risk. In a CAPM world where all investors hold the same market portfolio of risky assets, assets with higher market beta contribute more to portfolio risk:

$$
\text {E x p e c t e d a s s e t r e t u r n} = \text {R i s k l e s s r e t u r n} + \text {A s s e t b e t a} * \text {M a r k e t r i s k p r e m i u m} \tag {5.2}
$$

While the CAPM's assumptions, including the single-factor idea, turned out to be too restrictive, one broad insight in CAPM remains valid in most new models: only systematic risk is "priced" in the sense that it influences expected asset returns. Realized returns reflect both common (systematic) risk factors and asset-specific (idiosyncratic) risk. Risk premia compensate investors for systematic risk that cannot be diversified away, whereas idiosyncratic risk can be diversified away and does not warrant any risk premium [3].

# Box 5.1. Risk-based expected returns

As an illustration of a risk-based model of expected returns, the next graph shows what expected excess returns CAPM would imply for various asset classes if we use a global equity index as the risk factor. (This kind of across-asset-class analysis is hardly the most common use of CAPM. CAPM is mainly applied for single stocks or actively managed portfolios and uses the local equity index as the "benchmark" or market index.)

Even apart from the CAPM's theoretical shortcomings, simply estimating asset betas and the market risk premium is difficult. In Figure 5.1, I estimate betas using monthly data from 1990 to 2009 and assume a global market risk premium of  $4\%$  (over deposits). Each asset's expected excess return is, by CAPM assumption, proportional to its beta. Only relatively liquid asset classes are included because illiquid assets have notoriously understated betas.

The graph is only illustrative. Serious practitioners use more complex risk models with several factors and have more advanced techniques for estimating betas. Finally, despite the theoretical appeal of CAPM, the empirical relation between betas and realized average returns is weak.

# 5.2 THE NEW WORLD

# 5.2.1 Covariance with "bad times" is the key

The CAPM was a beautifully simple theory but it became clear over time that it could not explain the observed behavior of asset markets. So academics began to relax the model's various simplifying assumptions. The parallel to the evolution of modern corporate finance research from the Modigliani-Miller theorems is clear.

There is little consensus as to which extension to the CAPM is most needed, so I cover here several strands of literature. In the new thinking on expected returns, multiple systematic factors, time-varying risk premia, skewness and liquidity preferences, supply-demand effects, market frictions, and investor irrationalities can all play a role [4]. (No single model can capture all of these features. Theoretical models need to be analytically tractable and they should be parsimonious. My survey will be neither.)

Despite the diversity of new models, at least the rationally oriented academic literature retains one key idea in its core, albeit subtly different than in the old world. The asset price still equals expected discounted cash flows, but in a world of uncertainty and time-varying expected returns, equation (5.1) needs to be generalized. Using the new terminology:

$$
\operatorname {P r i c e} _ {t} ^ {i} = E _ {t} \left[ S D F _ {t + 1} * x _ {t + 1} ^ {i} \right] \tag {5.3}
$$ where SDF is the stochastic discount factor; and  $x$  is the payoff (cash flow) for asset  $i$  [5]. The term "stochastic" in SDF emphasizes the uncertainty in time-varying discount rates. But the great intuition is that SDF is an index of "bad times" and that the required risk premium for any asset (or a risk factor) reflects its covariation with bad times. Investors are willing to pay more—accept lower expected returns (i.e., lower risk premia)—for assets that tend to do well in bad times. Conversely, investors require higher risk premia for assets that tend to suffer in bad times. Here is a fundamental generalization of equation (5.2) for any risk premium or ex ante excess return:


$$

\text {R i s k} \quad \operatorname {p r e m i u m} _ {t} ^ {i} = - \text {C o v a r i a n c e} (\text {A s s e t e x c e s s r e t u r n} _ {t + 1} ^ {i}, S D F _ {t + 1}) \tag {5.4}

$$

The million dollar question is, of course, how to define bad times. Investors care about more than just low market returns. Formally, bad times are periods when investors' marginal utility (MU) is high—when an extra dollar in their pockets feels especially valuable. I might paraphrase U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's famous comment about pornography: bad times are difficult to define but "I know it when I see it."

# What kinds of environments imply high marginal utility?

- Consumption-based asset-pricing models associate bad times with negative consumption growth rates. The intuition of consumption smoothing is powerful: an extra dollar when we are hungry is worth more than when we are satiated [6].
- Recessions are often used to proxy for macroeconomic bad times. Periods of rising and/or high unemployment, rising and/or high inflation, or unexpected monetary policy tightening are other macroeconomic states that may be associated with high MU.
- Although neoclassical models do not emphasize this, it seems plausible that financial crises are important "high MU" environments, especially if financial institutions have a major role in setting asset prices. If we can equate bad times with stock market losses we get back the old CAPM, but "bad times" are likely to be more multi-dimensional. Sometimes other aspects of financial crises—a bond or housing market selloff, vanishing liquidity, de-leveraging spirals, a breakdown in financial intermediation, spiking volatility, high correlations that limit diversification—boost MU even when stock markets are relatively stable.
- The worst times are characterized by both financial and economic turbulence. Table 5.1 lists some periods that, in Justice Stewart's spirit, were manifestly bad times. One might formalize the definition but there is no (academic or practitioner) consensus on how to do this. All 20th-century recessions could qualify but the period of the Great Moderation was characterized by the absence of severe economic downturns and, instead, an abundance of periodic financial crises. The last two rows highlight episodes where major financial turmoil triggered depression fears—echoes of 1929—but Fed easing and/or bailouts saved the system yet again (and over time gave rise to ever greater risk taking).

The implications for asset pricing and expected returns are huge:

- On one hand, some safe haven assets like government bonds are not only "good diversifiers". They diversify best just when diversification is most needed (1998H2, 2001–2002, 2007H2–2008) and other diversifiers fail, they hedge equity markets best when equities are suffering most, and they benefit from "flight-to-quality" flows during financial crises. Safe haven assets may well warrant negative risk premia (i.e., expected returns below the riskless rate [7]).
- On the other hand, various strategies with asymmetric payoffs (positive carry trades, selling volatility and correlation, buying AAA credits vs. government bonds) may be even riskier than their negative skew and fat tails imply. The key point is the timing of losses: many such strategies effectively sell (not buy!) lottery tickets that pay off disproportionately during financial crises, just when MU is high. Thus these strategies face losses just when the losses are most painful. The coincidence of losses could reflect similar fundamental (tail) risk exposures but also liquidity-induced and positioning-induced correlation spikes (the latter were especially apparent in 1998, 2007, and 2008).
- I show empirically that many strategies with the best Sharpe ratios since the 1980s are of the second type. Their covariance with MU is high: they tend to lose money in bad times. This feature can largely explain their high Sharpe ratios. It is harder to explain the performance of government bonds since the 1980s as an equilibrium outcome, given the combination of a high Sharpe ratio and a wonderful diversification/hedging role. As noted, the high in-sample Sharpe ratios of Treasuries over that time frame likely reflect windfall gains from unanticipated yield declines. Note that the Sharpe ratios of Treasuries over periods ending in the early 1980s were very poor, reflecting windfall losses from unanticipated yield increases—a mirror image of the situation from the early 1980s to the present.
- Many practitioners define risk as unexpected losses, thereby ignoring the environment in which losses occur. In contrast, for academics, the timing of losses can determine riskiness as much as the amount of losses does (correlations matter more than volatilities).


# 5.2.2 Multiple risk factors

Since we cannot empirically identify one "true" factor for bad times, it is tempting to use multi-factor models. Robert Merton's Intertemporal CAPM and Stephen Ross's Arbitrage Pricing Theory introduced multi-factor models to finance theory as early as the 1970s. The empirical Fama-French three-factor model, developed in the early 1990s, has probably replaced the CAPM as the most popular factor model for equity investors.

Recall that, according to the CAPM, the  $i$ th asset's expected excess return,  $E_{t}(r_{t + 1}^{i})$ , is a product of its market beta,  $\beta_t^{iM}$ , and the market risk premium,  $\lambda_t^M$ , so that:

$$

E _ {t} \left(r _ {t + 1} ^ {i}\right) = \beta_ {t} ^ {i M} \lambda_ {t} ^ {M} \tag {5.5}

$$

$\beta$  is the amount of systematic risk in any given asset (thus, it varies across assets); and  $\lambda^M$  is the market risk premium that is common to all assets. We can further say that  $\lambda^M$  reflects both the amount of risk in the overall market (e.g., stock market volatility) and the price of risk (investor risk aversion).

Not surprisingly, CAPM's stance that "only market risk matters, all other risks can be diversified away" proved too restrictive. Empirical studies as early as the 1960s indicated that there are other common risk factors (e.g., industry factors) that are so systematic that they cannot be fully diversified away. It was still possible that such additional factors driving realized returns would not influence expected returns (i.e., these risk factors might not "be priced" in the sense of having nonzero risk premia), so the CAPM prevailed. However, over time academics and practitioners came up with a string of anomalies—evidence of dissimilar long-run average returns across stock portfolios that were inconsistent with the CAPM. The tide really turned when the seminal Fama-French (1992) study showed that a "value factor" and a "size factor"—actually the book-to-market ratio and market capitalization as equity characteristics, respectively, rather than factor sensitivities—could explain the cross-sectional variation in average equity returns better than a "market factor" could. Even worse for the CAPM, the cross-sectional reward for bearing beta risk appears to have been negligible or negative in recent decades.

If there are several common factors that generate undiversifiable risk, then a multifactor relation holds. If there are  $K$  systematic factors, the  $i$ th asset's expected excess return reflects its factor sensitivities  $(\beta^{i_1},\beta^{i_2},\ldots ,\beta^{i_K})$  and the factor risk premia  $(\lambda^1,\lambda^2,\dots ,\lambda^K)$ . For illustration, here is a simple two-factor case ( $K = 2$ ) with equity market risk and inflation risk. The expected excess return for any asset equals its equity beta times the equity risk premium plus its inflation beta times the inflation premium:

$$

E _ {t} \left(r _ {t + 1} ^ {i}\right) = \beta_ {t} ^ {i _ {1}} \lambda_ {t} ^ {1} + \beta_ {t} ^ {i _ {2}} \lambda_ {t} ^ {2} \tag {5.6}

$$ where  $E_{t}(r_{t + 1}^{i})$  is the expected excess return of asset  $i$ ;  $\beta_{t}^{j}$  (beta) is asset  $i$ 's sensitivity to factor  $j$  (here,  $j = 1$  is equity market, and  $j = 2$  is inflation); and  $\lambda_{t}^{j}$  (lambda) is the factor risk premium (market price of risk) for factor  $j$ .

Realized per-period excess returns for any asset can be expressed as a sum of the two systematic exposures (products of the asset's factor sensitivities and factor returns), plus an uncorrelated residual term (the part unexplained by the systematic factors). Realized factor returns contain both expected and unexpected components  $(\lambda + F)$ .

Within the SDF framework, if we assume that the SDF is linearly related to a set of common risk factors, then asset returns can be described by a linear factor model. Moreover, the idea that the risk premium depends on covariation with the SDF (bad times, high-MU periods) also applies to the risk factors—not just to individual assets. Different sources of return uncertainty can have different market prices.

If we view bad times as an underlying concept, the sign/size of each factor's market price of risk reflects its covariance with this meta-concept. Alternatively, we can treat different dimensions of bad times (negative growth, high inflation, financial crisis, illiquidity spiral, high volatility/correlations, etc.) as distinct factors. Each factor defines a different, though overlapping, set of high-MU periods that the average investor cares about. Investors who bear these priced factor risks effectively supply insurance to other investors against enduring losses in bad times and earn a factor risk premium as a compensation for this.

# Which factors?

Anything goes? Multi-factor models could include any factors, since theory gives limited guidance. Intertemporal (multi-period) models provide some direction. Merton's Intertemporal CAPM implies that priced factors other than market beta should hedge against future changes in the investment opportunity set. If investment opportunities vary over time, required returns also depend on assets' covariation with future investment opportunities. Merton suggested the long bond rate as one natural candidate factor, since all investors are exposed to the risk that they will not be able to invest at current rates.

Empirical models are theory-free representations in which factors are chosen to fit empirical asset return behavior; thus they are more prone to data-mining bias even if they may be justified with some economic logic. For example, the Fama-French value factor may reflect pronounced distress risk and the size factor may reflect illiquidity—though competing rational and irrational explanations exist. Both theoretical and empirical models serve a purpose. Empirical factor models are statistically better at explaining the cross-sectional and time series variation in asset returns, but economic models couched in theory may explain why any factors that are identified earn their risk premia.

Empirical models relate average returns to certain risk factor sensitivities (covariances) or directly to certain asset characteristics (value and size as noted above, carry, duration, or credit rating; etc.):

- One way to identify risk factors is to examine which factors are effective at explaining realized return variation over time and then to determine empirically if these factors are cross-sectionally "priced"; that is, if assets with high exposures to the candidate factor have significantly different average returns from assets with low exposures to that factor.
- Although it may seem even more ad hoc to use asset characteristics instead of factor sensitivities, the former are directly observable and might be less noisy measures of true factor risk exposures than historically estimated factor sensitivities.
- Often both approaches work empirically. For example, illiquid stocks have higher average returns than liquid stocks; separately, stocks whose returns covary more closely with a systematic "liquidity factor" (i.e., stocks with high-liquidity betas) have higher average returns than stocks with lower liquidity betas.

Factors with a strong theoretical basis include aggregate consumption growth (extensively studied for 30 years, with limited empirical success), investment growth (for production-based asset-pricing models) [8], as well as overall labor income growth and idiosyncratic job risk (recall that for many people the return on human capital is more important than the return on financial capital).

Equity factors that are primarily empirical include the last two of the three Fama-French factors (market beta, value, size) and often momentum as a fourth factor (driven by return evidence rather than by any economic risk story). The list could be extended, given growing evidence of cross-sectional return predictability, using indicators like return reversals (both short term and very long term), volatility, liquidity, distress, earnings momentum, quality factors such as accruals, and corporate actions such as asset growth and net issuance. Beyond equities, sensitivities to major asset classes (interest rate risk and credit risk in fixed income, and housing, oil, and dollar risks) are the most obvious factors to consider. The inflation factor is especially important for bonds, and liquidity for other assets. This chapter will not cover asset-pricing theories tailored for particular asset classes, such as government bonds (term structure of interest rates), credits, real estate, commodities, and currencies. I will briefly discuss such theories in Chapters 8-13.

# 5.2.3 Time-varying risk premia

Single-period models such as the CAPM indirectly imply constant expected returns over time. Other, more complex economic models often assume that volatilities and other risk measures are constant over time, and the most popular utility function implies constant relative risk aversion. No wonder, then, that for a long time academics were happy to assume constant risk premia and to estimate them using long-run average historical excess returns.

Things started to change in the 1980s. Diermeier-Ibbotson-Siegel (1984) made an early and largely ignored, but prescient, attempt to introduce time-varying risk premia from a purely theoretical standpoint. They argued that, in the indefinitely long run, stock prices could not grow faster than earnings, which could not grow faster than GDP adjusted for net new issues. The risk premium is the growth rate of earnings, plus the dividend yield, minus the riskless rate. Since all these variables are dynamic, the risk premium is time varying.

However, empirical evidence drove most of the change in thinking. It became increasingly obvious that ex ante real interest rates were not constant. Robert Shiller (1981) challenged the prevailing paradigm with evidence of excess volatility in financial markets. These patterns hint at irrationality but could be rationally justified with time-varying risk premia (because discount rate variation is another cause of volatility, in addition to the variation of expected cash flows that Shiller focused on). Elsewhere, academic journals began to fill with models of time-varying volatilities, while the introduction of stock and bond option markets confirmed that implied volatilities vary over time. Long-horizon studies presented evidence of mean reversion in stock prices, although it turned out that such long-horizon analysis is plagued with econometric problems. Fama-French (1989) documented countercyclical patterns in expected returns for both stocks and bonds, in line with required risk premia being high in "bad times" such as business cycle troughs. Although the focus soon turned to cross-sectional expected returns across equities, new evidence of predictable time variation in stock and bond returns was uncovered through the 1990s. Near the turn of the millennium, the equity market boom and bust reinforced the view that expected returns vary over time—for rational or irrational reasons. Practitioners became much more interested in ex ante return measures such as valuation ratios or dividend discount models. Several studies of the equity risk premium also shifted the academic focus from historical average returns to more forward-looking measures.

On the theoretical side, multi-period models make it plain that constant expected returns are a special case—albeit one that has the benefit of analytic tractability. Some early models made an ad hoc link between the risk aversion coefficient and equity market returns or the current health of the economy, but only habit formation models (discussed below) could formally derive wealth-dependent risk aversion (WDRA) from consumption utilities.

Theoretical models that imply time-varying risk premia can be quite complex. As an empirical shortcut, conditional (point-in-time) multi-factor models have become popular ways of allowing time-varying risks or time-varying risk aversion. In conditional models,  $\beta$ s (factor sensitivities) or  $\lambda$ s (factor risk premia) can be specified as linear functions of any set of predictors (conditioners) that are assumed to be in investors' information sets.

# Time-varying risks

Rolling estimates of second moments (historical volatilities, correlations, and factor sensitivities) are simple proxies of ex ante risks. In the past 20 years, academics have tried to improve on them by developing theoretical models of stochastic volatilities, simple linear models that predict future volatilities with a set of conditioners, more complex regime-switching models, and most importantly, a variety of so-called GARCH models. Opening up the acronym GARCH, to read "generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity", scares many investors, but the main idea is simply that volatility is not constant but varies predictably over time. Initial models focused on the idea that volatility comes in clusters—large shocks tend to be followed by large shocks and uneventful periods by more of the same. Despite persistence, volatility tends to gradually decay to a "normal" level from abnormal highs or lows. We have seen this pattern occur repeatedly in the financial market turmoil of 2007-2010. Extensions to GARCH-based volatility estimates included longer memories and return asymmetries (higher equity volatility in down markets, interest rate volatility depending on the rate level, etc.). GARCH models were also broadened to estimate ex ante correlations and factor sensitivities.

Time-varying risks are natural predictors of time-varying risk premia. However, models that link conditional volatilities and conditional mean returns have had limited success. Other empirical attempts to uncover a positive risk-reward relation between conditional equity market volatility and subsequent equity market return have had mixed results. While it is clear that high volatility tends to depress current equity prices, it is not clear that high volatility predicts above-average near-term returns for the equity market. I will describe some of this time series evidence in Chapter 19 as well as evidence on the cross-sectional relation between volatilities and equity returns.

# Time-varying risk aversion

The Fama-French (1989) evidence that expected stock and bond returns are especially high near business cycle troughs is exactly in line with the "covariance with bad times" idea. In Section 5.2.1, I expressed this idea as a cross-sectional prediction: assets that perform especially poorly in bad times should offer higher risk premia than assets that help us through bad times. In a time series context, we might then expect to see generally higher ex ante risk premia in bad times such as cyclical troughs or financial crises. However, this idea is not consistent with the widely used CRRA (constant relative risk aversion) utility function where risk appetite is independent of the investor's wealth level. (This utility function is widely used because it is mathematically tractable—not because it is realistic.) Only by incorporating a subsistence level into this utility function can we make risk aversion and required risk premia time-varying. When investors are closer to a subsistence level, any losses become less tolerable (see Figure 5.2).

Formal models are quite harsh in that agents really must ensure that they don't fall below the subsistence level or they face extinction (the academic term is "infinite negative utility"). In developed economies, subsistence level is not really linked to starvation or other causes of physical extinction, but to the (still painful) loss of the standard of living one is accustomed to. Despite this caveat, to me the insight that people or institutions become more risk averse when they become poorer captures something essential in investor behavior. In an institutional setting, breaching a subsistence level might have an analogue in the institution's bankruptcy, a trader reaching his or her terminal stop-loss limit or the point of an unaffordable margin call, a pension fund's minimum acceptable funding ratio, or a financial intermediary's binding capital constraint.

The presence of a broadly defined subsistence level makes investors' relative risk aversion vary with their wealth level and prompts them to act like someone trading a portfolio insurance strategy. When people feel wealthy (have a high cushion over the subsistence level) they can afford to take large risks. But if their wealth falls close to the subsistence level their risk aversion rises exponentially and they must shift their holdings to the riskless asset. Because falling aggregate wealth pushes many investors simultaneously closer to their subsistence levels, wealth-dependent risk aversion (WDRA) can have highly self-reinforcing effects on asset prices, especially crashes. Greater risk appetite after rising wealth and greater risk aversion after falling wealth creates a feedback loop (a virtuous or vicious circle) that contributes to boom-bust cycles and that makes asset returns more predictable and volatile than they would be had CRRA been a realistic assumption about investor utility.

Figure 5.2. Stylized illustration of wealth-dependent risk aversion.

However, the idea of WDRA is hard to model in a tractable fashion, especially in a multi-period context. The Campbell-Cochrane (1999) paper, "By force of habit", describes the best known finance model that exhibits WDRA. Habit formation captures the idea that past living standards influence the utility we derive from current consumption. Habit can be expressed as a time-varying subsistence level. Campbell and Cochrane model the subsistence level as a weighted average of past consumption, in the spirit of habituation or adaptation. Consumers derive utility from surplus consumption (excess of current consumption over subsistence level) and become exceedingly risk averse when this cushion becomes small.

In a broader context, habit formation and a time-varying subsistence level have evolutionary origins in human adaptiveness. People can adapt to new situations partly because their expectations adjust over time based on past experiences (both their own and neighbors' living standards). This is the best explanation of the apparent puzzle that various surveys find little change in self-reported happiness over the past half a century while material standards of living have dramatically improved [9].

The Campbell-Cochrane habit formation model is exceptionally successful in explaining various empirical puzzles, including the observed predictability (countercyclical time variation) in stock and bond market excess returns. Habit formation models imply changing tastes (for risk) over time. Rationally oriented economists tend to dislike the assumption of changing tastes, while behavioral economists embrace this idea (e.g., wealth-dependent market sentiment which would be hard to distinguish from WDRA).

It is important to understand that if time-varying expected returns reflect rational variation in risk premia, it does not follow that every investor should try to take advantage of them. For most investors these fluctuations do not give opportunities for utility-enhancing active trading because periods of high expected returns coincide with bad times and abnormally high risk aversion. However, a minority of cool-headed investors who in some relevant characteristics differ significantly from the market (long horizon, deep pockets—Warren Buffett and sovereign wealth funds come to mind) may be well served by contrarian market-timing strategies or at least by a disciplined rebalancing regime [10].

Unfortunately, the theoretical literature on time-varying risk premia is largely separate from the studies explaining the cross-sectional variation in expected asset returns. Fama's (1991) survey called for a coherent story that (1) relates the cross-sectional properties of expected returns to time variation in expected returns, and (2) relates the behavior of expected returns to the real economy. The search is still on—and some answers may need to be found outside the rational paradigm.

# 5.2.4 Incorporating skewness preferences

One way to extend the single-factor CAPM is to relax the assumption that people only care about mean and variance. The idea that people have skewness preferences (they are willing to pay up for lottery-type payoffs or for downside protection) is one of the key themes of this book. A growing literature studies the observed asymmetries in asset returns as well as their pricing implications (including pricing of options whose payoffs are inherently skewed).

If the SDF is linearly related to both market return and its variance, we get a three-moment conditional CAPM where expected asset returns reflect their conditional covariance with market return and with market variance (conditional co-skewness). In this model, the key aspect of skewness is not asymmetry in the standalone returns of a given asset but its contribution to the market portfolio's skewness (i.e., the co-skewness of the asset with the market). All else equal, people prefer assets that tend to earn high returns during volatile markets and thus make their portfolio more positively skewed (lottery ticket like). Such assets are rare, however, and people are willing to pay a high price for this characteristic. Conversely, people dislike negative skewness and require extra ex ante reward for holding assets—often volatility selling or carry trades—that perform poorly during volatile markets (and thereby make their portfolio more negatively skewed).

More behavioral considerations need to be invoked to explain the reward for assets' standalone skewness. Some authors simply assume that investors prefer assets with lottery-like payoffs while others argue that weighting of low-probability events can make skewness "priced". More on these questions in Sections 6.2 and 19.4.

# 5.2.5 Investor irrationality and rational learning

The next chapter covers investor irrationality in detail; here I make brief remarks on rational learning. Rational expectations, a key paradigm in economics and finance since the 1970s, has been increasingly challenged over the past decade. Rational expectations involve making an optimal forecast that uses all available information—there should be no systematic (predictable) forecasting errors. Rational investors have correct beliefs about the probability distribution they face (which implies "Bayesian updating" when processing new information) and make decisions like expected utility maximizers. It is common to assume a stable structural model whose structure agents know. More realistic hypotheses allow a time-varying structure and agents rationally learning about it. Such settings can explain the observed predictability of markets or apparently biased expectations, such as the well-known phenomenon in which investors underpredicted inflation in the 1970s and then overpredicted it in the 1980s. One need not resort to irrationality to explain these behaviors.

Brav-Heaton (2002) stress the mathematical similarity between behavioral finance models (investors who are irrational but possess correct information about market variables and economic structures) and learning models (investors who are completely rational but possess substantially incomplete information). The similarity is not just a coincidence but is related to the limits of arbitrage. Both in theory and in the real world, irrationality and incompleteness of information may be highly correlated. Where information is more complete, arbitrage opportunities are often taken advantage of, and irrationality-induced anomalies are less likely to survive.

# 5.2.6 Other determinants of expected returns

# Supply-demand factors

In economic theories supply and demand are central concepts, but in neoclassical finance theories they are not, thanks to arbitrage arguments. Arbitrage between assets that are perfect substitutes makes demand curves for specific, non-unique assets flat (horizontal). Thus the CAPM implies virtually flat demand curves for individual stocks because their diversifiable risk can be ignored (investors act as if they were risk neutral with regards to diversifiable risk). The market will price assets so that the expected returns on assets with similar risks are equal. If any particular asset should offer a higher expected return due solely to the increase in the quantity outstanding, investors will soon arbitrage away such profit opportunities. Arbitrage is possible because assets are "not unique works of art" but have close counterparts in other assets or mixes of other assets (Scholes, 1972). If there are perfect substitutes and frictionless markets, buying a high-expected-return asset while selling a substitute with a lower expected return constitutes a riskless arbitrage.

Subsequent empirical studies disputed the notion that perfect substitutes exist. Demand effects may play a key role in explaining time-varying risk premia, given the lack of substitutes for market risk exposures. Even the substitutability of single stocks can be challenged. A key example is the S&P 500 inclusion effect—the finding that new entries to the S&P 500 index experience a sudden and persistent price jump, presumably due to new buying pressure from index funds. Shleifer (1986) argued that if stocks have horizontal demand curves, no price impact is expected, but if demand curves are downward sloping, the rightward shift in the demand curve implies a sudden price increase, consistent with the evidence. Later research shows that the degree of substitutability varies (some stocks to be included have close counterparts, while others have much lower correlations—and thus have greater arbitrage risk). Stocks lacking close substitutes experience higher price jumps upon inclusion into the S&P 500. Still, index funds are expected by their investors to hold every stock in the S&P 500 index and some price pressure effect should be observed for any stock added to that index, no matter how many close substitutes the stock has.

These findings are interesting by themselves but they also have a broader message. If asset demand curves slope downwards (due to imperfect substitutability), shifts in asset supplies can influence prices and expected returns. Scarcity may boost current asset prices and reduce expected returns while abundance may do the opposite. Arbitrage does mitigate the supply-demand effects on asset prices and expected returns (especially among stocks with close substitutes) but because market frictions exist and arbitrage is not riskless, it does not fully eliminate them.

# Supply effects—examples

- Shorter run supply influences are especially notable for commodities that lack substitutes. A sudden shortage can cause sharp upward spikes in certain commodity prices.
- Another setting where scarcity may be important is the case of riskless assets where financial intermediaries cannot affect the net supply of demanded assets.

$\bigcirc$  Persistent fiscal surpluses, bond buybacks, and the prospective scarcity of Treasuries widened U.S. swap-government spreads to record-wide levels in 2000-2001, especially for ultra-long bonds. In the United Kingdom, long gilts became even more expensive due to supportive supply and demand factors.

- The most actively traded bonds often become "special" in the repo market, having financing rates 100 bp or more below general collateral rates, when "shorts" cannot borrow sufficient amounts of the bond.
- Even with stocks, there are occasions where an issuer has enough monopoly power to create (deliberate or accidental) scarcity. A well-known example is the Palm/3Com case, in which, near the peak of the dot.com mania, 3Com spun off its subsidiary Palm, selling  $5\%$  of its shares in the open market and promising the rest later. Palm instantly acquired a greater total market capitalization than its corporate parent 3Com, implying that the stub (3Com ex Palm) had a negative value. The Law of One Price clearly did not apply. Too few shares of Palm were available for arbitrageurs to take advantage of the opportunity (to sell Palm shares and buy 3Com shares, earning a large riskless profit). Once further Palm shares became available, this anomaly disappeared.

# Demand effects—examples

- Demographic developments may have a significant impact on asset prices but the results are controversial. The high proportion of prime-age savers (40 to 60-year-olds) in the population may have contributed to the 1990s "baby-boomer rally" in the stock market. Similar considerations have led to fears of falling prices for risky assets when baby-boomers retire.
- The savings glut story was one key explanation of the "conundrum" of low bond yields in the 2000s. Some controversial estimates suggest that foreign investor (mainly Asian central banks) demand for U.S. Treasuries reduced Treasury yields by more than 100 bp and other bond yields (close substitutes) by somewhat less.
- New assets may be structurally cheap until they find their natural home. Investor demand for inflation-linked bonds was quite limited following their introduction in 1997. The U.S. Treasury's hopes of cost savings—avoiding the inflation risk premium by issuing "real" rather than nominal bonds—were soon quashed. Inflation risk premia apparently had become tiny by 1997 and in the early years TIPS had to offer a large illiquidity or novelty premium to attract investors. Gradually investor interest in TIPS grew and the illiquidity/novelty premium decayed. Yet in 2008 de-leveraging and scant institutional demand made TIPS again very cheap for a short while.
- Investor positioning matters, especially during de-leveraging episodes. However, commentary about overcrowded trades is often too simplistic. Some forget that tautologically for every buyer there is a seller, so net active positions always amount to zero. When desired net buying wanes, market prices need to fall to attract new buyers. More meaningfully, overcrowding refers to situations where levered traders—the least reliable asset holders—have concentrated positions or where the whole financial market or a certain sector is exceptionally levered. In such situations, any trigger may lead to a mass rush toward the exit and to vicious cycles of liquidations and further price falls. A liquidity drought is the possible final outcome of such a cycle.
- The wide yield gap between Treasury debt and top-rated money market deposits or corporate bonds used to be one example of market segmentation caused by investor regulation or preferred habitats. Another example is the kink between the yields and long-run average returns of BBB-rated and BB-rated bonds—the borderline between investment-grade and speculative-grade ratings. Many investors are only allowed to hold investment-grade bonds; this constraint seems to boost the long-run return of BB-rated bonds.
- Market segmentation effects may be even more pronounced across countries given that the liberalization of foreign capital flows is incomplete. The full integration of all countries into global markets is a hoped-for outcome, not a reality.

# Market frictions and illiquidity premia

The impact of supply-demand factors—and of investor irrationalities—on asset prices is made possible by market frictions. Frictions related to illiquidity, funding constraints, and trading costs, as well as counterparty risk, agency concerns, and other information problems can be first-order important, as the 2008 experience shows. Bearish expectations, elevated risk, and risk aversion do not alone explain the distressed price levels of securitized bonds and other assets. Many financial intermediaries and investors became forced sellers as market frictions prevented them and other investors from taking advantage of good deals or nearly riskless arbitrage opportunities. Opportunities that appeared compelling over the long horizon could not be taken due to the possibility that further de-levering and related mark-to-market volatility would make the investment positions unsustainable over the short run.

A diverse literature on market frictions explains why asset prices might deviate from fair values or respond sluggishly to new information. However, few asset-pricing models relate asset risk premia to market frictions such as funding and liquidity constraints. Garleanu-Pedersen (2009a) propose a model in which the CAPM risk premium is boosted when binding funding constraints make capital scarce, while Acharya-Pedersen (2005) have adjusted the CAPM to include liquidity-related premia.

Illiquidity is the most important market friction. Early studies of liquidity premia focused on the cost (rather than the risk) of illiquidity—they observed that greater trading costs when buying and selling assets would reduce expected net returns. Later studies considered a liquidity factor as a systematic exposure that may be priced. Empirical studies identified a systematic liquidity factor—commonality of returns for assets with high "illiquidity betas"—and showed that both the illiquidity characteristic and the liquidity factor appear to be priced. This is not surprising given that sudden liquidity droughts tend to coincide with bad times. These illiquidity-related premia appear to raise the expected returns of certain alternative asset classes as well as less liquid pockets of traditional asset classes, such as corporate bonds and small-cap equities. Illiquidity premia are hardly constant over time; they apparently were bid down to near zero by early 2007 and then rose sky high during the 2008 liquidity drought.

# Disagreement and information asymmetries

Another CAPM assumption—homogeneous expectations—is obviously unrealistic, but this was a very convenient modeling device. In the past decade, disagreement models showed how differences in investor beliefs can influence financial markets through several channels: gradual information flow, limited attention, and heterogeneous views. Disagreement is especially important for explaining the high level of trading volume, but it also can help explain correlation or volatility risk premia as well as some cross-sectional patterns in equity returns. For example, high levels of disagreement and short-selling constraints together predict relatively low equity returns because overvalued stocks cannot be shorted and tend to be held by the most optimistic investors.

Asymmetric information refers to situations in which one party is better informed than the other, leading to so-called principal-agent problems (including moral hazard, adverse selection, conflict of interest). Vayanos-Woolley (2010) show that delegated asset management can cause momentum patterns. As investors (principals) try to learn about a manager's (agent's) skill from his past performance and effectively chase returns, the resulting fund flows push prices away from fair values, inducing short-term momentum and long-term reversal patterns.

# 5.3 DETOUR: A BRIEF SURVEY OF THE EFFICIENT MARKETS HYPOTHESIS

Before turning to behavioral finance, it is appropriate to briefly survey the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH). The classic statement from Fama (1970) is that markets are informationally efficient if "prices reflect all available information". The EMH is also closely tied to the assumption of investor rationality.

The main practical implication of the EMH is investors' inability to consistently beat the market. Why? Competition among many profit-seeking agents eliminates any easy pickings. Active management is a zero-sum game even before costs; after trading costs and fees it is a negative-sum game (this observation is mathematically true regardless of whether the market is efficient). Empirical analyses unequivocally confirm that most managers underperform passive indices after fees and leave open the possibility that winners have just been lucky. People's innate optimism and the financial industry's marketing machines have been able to muddle these messages, thereby slowing the lure of passive investing.

In its early years, the EMH was often equated with the random walk hypothesis (RWH). The ideas are closely linked. According to the RWH, aggressive competition among market participants to exploit any predictable patterns makes price changes fully random and unpredictable. All news is instantly incorporated into market prices. However, the EMH allows time variation in rational risk premia whereas the RWH assumes the special case of constant expected returns. Thus, evidence of return predictability only rejects the RWH—not the EMH. More generally, Fama stresses that only a joint hypothesis of market efficiency and a particular asset-pricing model is testable. If the joint hypothesis is rejected it can reflect the failure of either part. Indeed, Fama raised the possibility of time-varying expected returns (return predictability) even before the empirical studies of Shiller and others challenged the joint hypothesis of EMH and constant expected returns.

Grossman-Stiglitz (1980) pointed out that in the presence of information-gathering and trading costs, markets cannot be perfectly efficient. Some degree of inefficiency is needed to motivate information gathering and trading. A variation on this theme notes that general overconfidence may lead to more information gathering than is cost-effective and thus to markets that are more efficient than is economically warranted. A practical compromise argues that although markets are not quite efficient, it is so difficult to beat the market that for most investors it is best to act as if they were efficient.

One interesting newcomer is Andrew Lo's adaptive markets hypothesis (2004), which begins to apply evolutionary and ecological principles to financial markets. So far, it is not a disciplined theory but a collection of interesting ideas, such as the following. Market relationships are inherently less stable than fixed physical laws. Human interactions, such as market participants' copying successful strategies, lead to complex feedback effects. Asset prices may thus reflect the number and nature of investor groups in the market ecology. Greater competition in one area will deplete profits but also reduce the population, thereby reducing the competition and possibly starting a new cycle of renewed profitability. Aggregate risk preferences will vary with the relative sizes and preferences of various groups in the market ecology. Recent market experiences will, through natural selection, influence the current investor population's composition and aggregate risk preferences. Lo argues that various apparently irrational behavioral traits could reflect our ancestral behavior having not yet had time to adapt to modern contexts, so that individuals adapt to a changing environment through simple, and ultimately incorrect and unprofitable, heuristics (such as naive extrapolation of the recent past).

My take is that changing ecology tends to make markets more efficient over time—although not in a straight line, as the experience of 2008 shows. Active market participation has shifted from individuals to institutions and, among institutions, from traditional managers to hedge funds. Combined with the computer/Internet revolution, these shifts seem to raise the relative size of the smart money share in the ecology and thus the level of competitiveness and market efficiency. As a result of growing arbitrage capital and leverage, markets probably grew more microefficient before 2008, while arguably becoming macro-inefficient, given the broad underpricing of risks [11]. In 2007–2009, risk aversion returned with a vengeance. Amidst de-leveraging and dwindling arbitrage capital, micro-inefficiencies (relative mispricings) ballooned and expected macro-risk premia shifted quickly from historic lows to multi-decade highs.

# Recent criticism of the EMH

Besides "anomalies" (patterns of return predictability that are not easily explained by rational models), the crash of 1987, the 1999-2002 tech bubble and bust, and the 2006-2009 boom-bust period have been major challenges to the EMH. In 2008-2009 some critics went further and blamed the EMH for being one cause of the crisis. They blamed widespread belief in the EMH, and more loosely "market fundamentalism", for the laissez faire attitude of policymakers and regulators: letting leverage and asset booms grow unchecked and allowing ever more complex financial instruments and questionable sales practices flourish without restraint, under the cover that the market would inevitably get the prices of these securities right. Other criticisms come as though out of a scattergun: some attack the classical notion that competitive markets are inherently self-stabilizing, others blame the Fed's asymmetric policy responses, while others fault the use of normal distribution and VaR-based risk management in a world where fat tails dominate. All of these criticisms are only tangentially related to the EMH, yet some of the critics do not seem to realize that.

To me, a fair conclusion is that recent events have undermined the validity of the EMH's main idea—that market prices are always "right" (near the fair value)—but have underlined the validity of its main implication for most investors—that beating the markets is extremely difficult (no free lunches).

It is ironic that while the EMH is seen as one scapegoat for the 2008 crisis, behavioral finance has survived unscathed, with its reputation even enhanced. On this topic critics apparently focus on policymakers' and regulators' apparent faith in the EMH, while ignoring the mistakes made by banks and investors. If the financial industry carried an academic banner in recent decades, it was certainly not for the EMH but for behavioral finance, given the promise that the latter holds for profit-making opportunities.

Critics of the EMH often use as a straw man the most extreme version of the hypothesis, a version that not even the most ardent proponents of the EMH subscribe to any more, if they ever did. Although the EMH paradigm has faced a vigorous challenge from behavioral finance, there is no doubt that the EMH has been a powerful organizing principle for theoretical and empirical work in finance that has improved our understanding of asset returns.

# 5.4 NOTES

[1] It is perhaps useful for intuition to rearrange equation (5.1) to show that  $1 +$  Expected return  $=$  Expected future cash flows  $\div$  Their current cost (market price). This is only a linear approximation, however, if expected returns are uncertain. I ignore nonlinear "Jensen's inequality" terms throughout this book because their empirical impact tends to be small.

[2] This sensitivity or "beta" is the simple regression coefficient of asset returns on market returns (typically the U.S. equity market). It is also the ratio of the covariance of an asset with the market to the variance of the market itself, and under CAPM assumptions it measures the asset's marginal contribution to portfolio risk. Covariance between an asset and the market is the correlation between the two, multiplied by the standard deviation of both the asset and the market.

[3] Here is a more modern statement of CAPM's key insight (Campbell, 2000, p. 1515): "If all investors are single-period mean variance optimizers, then the market portfolio is mean variance efficient, which implies a beta-pricing relation between all assets and the market portfolio." This formulation stresses the mean variance efficiency of market portfolios and a consequent linear risk-reward relation. It leaves open the specification of the unobservable market portfolio. Most of the empirical work on CAPM has focused on the U.S. equity market as its proxy. The market portfolio was later broadened to include global equities and other risky asset classes.

[4] In the rational framework, the expected return equation (5.2) can be extended to include multiple risk factors, possibly with time-varying amounts or prices of risk. Irrational stories may be better viewed in the context of equation (5.1), with a distinction between the market price and a perceived fair price. The market price can exceed the fair price if investors are overoptimistic when predicting future cash flows or excessively complacent, requiring insufficient compensation for risk (too low a discount rate). The perceived fair price may be based on a valuation model or an active discretionary view.

[5] Wonkish: Equation (5.3) requires very weak assumptions. The existence of an SDF (pricing kernel) that relates payoffs to market prices for all assets follows from the absence of arbitrage opportunities. Further assumptions about the economy's structure produce more specific results than equation (5.3). For example, the SDF can be related to the marginal utility of consumption—as discussed in the main text—or asset returns can be described by a linear factor model—including single-factor models' CAPM (equity market return as the only risk factor) or consumption CAPM (aggregate consumption growth rate as the only risk factor). If we assume a linear relation between the SDF and the market return (plus the existence of a riskless asset), we get CAPM.

General equilibrium models make assumptions about preferences and production technology to derive optimal asset demands. In equilibrium, expected returns adjust until all wealth is invested in the production processes. Most equilibrium models ignore the production side by assuming an exchange economy with one consumption good and then focus on the preferences of a representative agent who maximizes the expected utility of lifetime consumption. The prototypical case involves time-separable utility (only current and future consumption matter, not past consumption) and constant relative risk aversion (the same proportion of wealth is invested in the risky asset at all wealth levels). In equilibrium, asset prices are set so that the consumer holds all the assets (market clearing) and is indifferent to buying or selling a small unit of any asset. Such optimizing behavior implies the fundamental valuation equation (5.3), that asset price is equal to the expected product of a future payoff and the SDF.

[6] A common formal specification assumes a representative agent and time-separable utility of consumption. Then the SDF equals an impatience factor times a ratio of MU next period over MU today (where MU is the marginal utility of one additional unit of consumption). The latter ratio is called the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution—the rate at which investors are willing to substitute one unit of consumption today for one unit of consumption next period. This relation determines the theoretical level of the real riskless rate.

[7] A caveat is in order. Safe haven characteristics can be unstable, like other correlations. Government bonds have been excellent safe haven assets since the late 1990s, but they were anything but safe havens during the inflationary recessions of the 1970s (see Chapter 7).

[8] One interesting newcomer is "An alternative three-factor model" by Chen-Novy-Marx-Zhang (2010). Loosely motivated by Tobin's  $q$ -theory, the authors use three factors: the market, corporate investment (return gap between stocks with a low and high investment/ assets ratio), and return on assets (return gap between stocks with a high and low return on assets). The model can better explain a wide spectrum of cross-sectional anomalies than the Fama-French model.

[9] Actually the Campbell-Cochrane model uses "external habit" for tractability reasons: People adapt to general living standards rather than to their personal experience ("internal habit"). This idea is known as "keeping up with the Joneses" and is consistent with evidence that peer comparisons matter hugely for happiness, perhaps more than actual wealth levels. As an aside, smart happiness researchers note from an evolutionary perspective that humans are not designed to be happy but to pursue happiness—including wealth and status. Unfortunately, such a pursuit partly promotes unhappiness. Discontent with our current lot gives us the drive for absolute and relative success—an evolutionarily useful trait. However, setting (unrealistically) high expectations and choosing (too) challenging peer benchmarks raise the bar but also lead to frequent disappointments.

[10] Cochrane (2007) argues that discount rate variation emphasizes the role of the average investor compared with the marginal investor, who is central in neoclassical finance models. The elusive marginal investor (often a smart arbitrageur) sets asset prices when new information arrives and modest, if any, new positions are needed to move the asset price to a new equilibrium that incorporates the new information. In contrast, discount rates (factor risk premia) reflect the average demands of all investors. The market's expected return for an asset reflects a wealth-weighted average of its participants' expected returns. Thus, if one systematic factor has a too high risk premium, the average investor needs to change his behavior and make this risk more widely shared. Since this process may be slow, markets can maintain segmented risk premia for a long time. However, hedge funds are speeding up this process of arbitrating away any attractive risk premium opportunities.

[11] Microefficiency refers to the efficient relative pricing of assets. In contrast, macro-inefficiency refers to mispricing in the aggregate level of risky assets (say, the stock market) that may be harder to battle because of the undiversifiable nature of the mispricing and the risk that it might worsen.

Source notes. This chapter owes a special debt to the work of John Cochrane (e.g., 1999, 2005, 2006) and John Campbell (e.g., 1999, 2000). No one has surveyed the huge academic literature on the macro-foundations of expected returns with as much insight and lucidity as the two JCs. I will not give due references here to the fathers of modern asset-pricing models—Sharpe, Merton, Ross, and others—but rather point to the survey books by Peter Bernstein (1991, 2007), Mark Rubinstein (2006), and Justin Fox (2009). On the huge literature of multi-factor models, I only mention Chen-Roll-Ross (1986), Fama-French (1992), and Chen-Novy-Marx-Zhang (2010).

On time-varying expected returns I mention Shiller (1981), Poterba-Summers (1986), Fama-French (1989), and Campbell-Cochrane (1999), on skewness Harvey-Siddique (2000), on learning Brav-Heaton (2002) and Pastor-Veronesi (2009). On supply-demand factors I cite Scholes (1972) and Lamont-Thaler (2003), on index inclusion effects Shleifer (1986) and Wurgler-Zhuravskaya (2002), on inflation-linked bonds D'Amico et al. (2010), on market frictions Garleanu-Pedersen (2009a), on liquidity Acharya-Pedersen (2005), on disagreement Hong-Stein (2007), and on information asymmetries Vayanos-Woolley (2008).

On the efficient markets hypothesis, I recommend Fama's surveys (1970, 1991, 1998), on extensions Grossman-Stiglitz (1980) and Lo (2004), on the many criticisms Soros (2008), Akerlof-Shiller (2009), and Fox (2009), and on defense Rubinstein (2001), Cochrane (2007), and Ball (2009).

# Behavioral finance

- Behavioral finance states that investor irrationality causes systematic mispricings that rational arbitrageurs cannot fully offset due to scarce capital and riskiness of "arbitrage".
- Irrationality reflects biased beliefs (heuristic shortcuts, such as representativeness and conservatism, and self-deception, such as overconfidence and hindsight) as well as nonclassical preferences (loss aversion, narrow framing, overweighting low-probability events, etc.).
- Behavioral finance literature is fun and offers stories for most observed empirical anomalies, perhaps too easily.
- The best known market-level mispricings are speculative bubbles—related to extrapolative expectations, overconfidence, and herding. The best known relative mispricings are value and momentum effects. There is an alternative rational explanation for each of these—and it is often impossible to discriminate empirically between the rational and irrational alternatives.
- Behavioral finance is often used as justification for active management. Yet, the limits-to-arbitrage literature stresses how difficult it is to exploit mispricings over any sustained time period.

Behavioral finance rests on two pillars:

(i) Some investors are irrational. Their biased beliefs and preferences influence their demand for assets and can move market prices, causing mispricings.

(ii) Various limits to arbitrage prevent rational arbitrageurs from fully offsetting the impact that such irrational investors have on market prices.

Before describing investor psychology (sources of behavioral biases), I start with the limits to arbitrage to show that psychology matters. Then I review financial market applications—speculative bubbles and other market inefficiencies—and try to link them to their psychological foundations.

# 6.1 LIMITS TO ARBITRAGE

Behavioral finance argues that certain anomalous asset-pricing patterns—where market prices appear to deviate from fundamental values—can be explained by the presence of irrational traders. Experimental studies show evidence of various behavioral biases that could influence investors' demand for a given asset. Moreover, these biases appear to be systematic—perhaps due to their evolutionary origins—so they would not cancel out across investors. However, a powerful early counterargument by Milton Friedman (1953) was that rational traders will view any such mispricings as trading opportunities and by taking advantage of market dislocations they will undo any price impact irrational traders might have. This argument sounds especially compelling in today's world with thousands of hedge funds "on the job" competing exactly for such opportunities. Yet a sequence of papers from the late 1980s to Shleifer-Vishny (1997), dubbed the limits-to-arbitrage literature, argue convincingly that arbitrage is both risky and costly, so that arbitrageurs, at least in many cases, do not have enough capacity to fully counter the impact of irrational ("noise") traders. The Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) crisis in 1998—more than a year after the Shleifer and Vishny article came out—followed the script so closely that it showered real-world credibility on these arguments. If further supportive evidence was needed, the next decade provided it in spades.

Noise trader models assume two types of traders—rational arbitrageurs ("smart money"), and noise traders (mere mortals) whose sentiment and asset demands can irrationally change over time. If irrational demand from noise traders moves prices away from their fundamental values, arbitrageurs will try to exploit the mispricing and bring prices back to fundamentals. However, arbitrage strategies that are designed to correct mispricing can be risky, limiting their use.

Arbitrage is only riskless in the extreme case of perfect substitutability and frictionless markets. Most real-world "arbitrage" opportunities deserve quotation marks because they are only "good deals" that can move against the arbitrageur. With micro-inefficiencies where good substitutes (highly correlated assets) exist, arbitrageurs can put on relative value trades so that some of the risk in arbitrage is hedged. With macroindeficiencies (say, a market bubble) without good asset substitutes, such hedging is not possible, so the arbitrating of market-level mispricing is risky and unattractive.

Arbitrageurs face both the fundamental risk of adverse news and the "noise trader risk" of the possibility that sentiment will make mispricing worse. If arbitrageurs have longer horizons than noise traders, they can be more aggressive and can "ride out" temporary mispricings.

Noise trader risk is exacerbated when arbitrageurs manage other people's money and face the risk of capital withdrawals. In reality, such delegated fund management is typical for arbitrageurs (such as hedge funds). The use of outside investor funding increases the likelihood that the arbitrageur has to liquidate his position at the worst possible time. The agency relation means that end-customers are more likely to withdraw capital just when mispricing trades have moved maximally against the arbitrageur. End-customers assess an arbitrageur's ability by studying performance track records; and widening mispricing normally implies deteriorating performance for the arbitrageur. To compound the arbitrageurs' problems when they are facing losses, creditors may make margin calls if leverage is employed, stop-loss rules or risk managers can require position reductions, and vanishing liquidity may reinforce the downward spiral. All these considerations push arbitrageurs toward short time horizons and constrain their position sizes. There are also transaction costs and model uncertainty to consider. Trading costs on leveraged strategies can be significant. Barring remarkable hubris, no arbitrageur can be completely confident that his model or view is correct.

One important implication for long-horizon institutional investors is that when they delegate asset management, external managers may not inherit the ultimate investor's long horizon. Principal-agent problems shorten horizons from both sides, a phenomenon that can make the long-horizon investor lose his natural edge.

Market turmoil in 1998 and 2007-2008 taught us additional features that should discourage arbitrage activities—VaR-based risk management and crowded trade risk:

- Risk management systems that make sense for any one investor can increase systemic risk. A vicious circle can arise when rising risks (in VaR models or in other reactive risk measures) trigger mandatory or voluntary position reductions (but the problem is much worse if mandatory); widespread liquidations can destabilize the markets and require further reductions. Procyclical regulatory capital requirements have a similar impact.
- If many leveraged arbitrageurs have similar positions, the desire of some of them to liquidate positions can cause a rush to the exit that makes even fundamentally unrelated positions move temporarily in lockstep—against the arbitrageurs. Smart strategies may thus have more "crowding risk" than popular naive strategies. Downside correlations are often higher than normal correlations, especially for "smart" trades that appear to offer a favorable long-run reward to risk. Indeed, there may now exist an endogenous systematic risk factor associated with crowded trades.

The limits-to-arbitrage literature has been highly influential:

- It explains why behavioral biases can leave a large footprint in the market even in a world filled with opportunistic hedge funds. It even suggests which types of mispricings are less susceptible to attracting arbitrage—notably, those where mispriced assets lack close substitutes, where mispricings correct slowly, or where perceived model uncertainty is high.
- It stresses that even in inefficient markets there may be no free lunches. Thus the well-documented difficulty of beating the market does not necessarily imply that market prices equal fundamental values.
- The literature has broadened to study more generally the role of financial institutions and agency costs. The impediments to arbitrage include diverse risks as well as capital, leverage, and margin constraints.
- I use the terms "investor irrationality" and "market inefficiency" interchangeably because the former is often thought to imply the latter. This is only true given limited arbitrage; otherwise the actions of a few smart arbitrageurs would undo the price dislocations caused by many irrational traders.

# 6.2 PSYCHOLOGY

Experimental studies reveal systematic biases in people's judgments as well as systematic deviations from the preferences implied by the rational expected utility paradigm. I review some main behavioral biases before turning to their possible impact on asset prices.

All these psychological features are underpinnings of the developing theory of investor sentiment—how real-world investors actually form their beliefs, preferences, and demand schedules for assets. This second foundation of behavioral finance is still much patchier, and less coherent, than the limits-to-arbitrage literature but, in a sense, this is where the meat is.

# 6.2.1 Biases

# 6.2.1.1 Heuristic simplifications

Evolutionary logic is most obvious with heuristics. Humans have limited attention, memory, and information-processing capacities. Given our limited cognitive resources, we cannot analyze the world around us optimally. Instead, heuristics—rules of thumb or mental shortcuts—have evolved to help us select subsets of available information that are believed to be the most relevant. Recent psychological and neuro-finance research suggest that we humans have two models of probabilistic assessment that work in different parts of the brain: system I thinking (quick heuristics, intuition) and system II thinking (deliberative rational reasoning). System I mechanisms are much older; they evolved to help humans survive the most important challenges faced in the prehistoric environment. These inherited mechanisms can still help us cope in the more complex modern world but they can also lead to systematic errors, including some that can cost us money. The evolutionary character of this argument also suggests that people share similar heuristics; biases are not whims that average out across different individuals.

These fascinating ideas are elaborated on in Hirshleifer (2001), Montier (2007), and Zweig (2008).

# Attention and memory biases

Selective attention on easily accessible information causes availability bias. We are more likely to recall—and overweight—information that is salient, vivid, attention grabbing, familiar, emotionally hitting, or simply more recent. We also like stories; we want to understand complex events through simple narratives. These biases distort our probability and frequency judgments.

# Representativeness

Representativeness is the phenomenon by which people rely too much on stereotypes instead of cold probability analysis. People who judge the probability of an outcome based on how similar it is to the stereotype of the perceived true process tend to ignore sample size and neglect "base-rate" information. (Base-rate neglect refers to the tendency to misappraise the frequency of an event in a relevant population. The classic example is that based on a brief characterization—a quiet older woman wearing glasses—people guess that the person described is a librarian because she resembles a stereotypical librarian; information about the relative scarcity of librarians in the population is neglected.) They also expect each data sample to reflect the salient characteristics of the underlying true process. This misconception causes them to be surprised if they see a random series appear to exhibit trends and can make them see patterns in truly random sequences, leading to extrapolation where none is justified. The evolutionary origin of extrapolation is obvious: humans are hardwired to mimic visibly successful solutions to problems because such imitation enhanced our distant ancestors' survival prospects.

# Box 6.1. Extrapolation and reversal tendencies

Shefrin (2002) discusses evidence that individual investors tend to extrapolate (predict trend continuation) while professional managers and strategists tend to predict reversals. Why this difference? And can we really claim that both biases are caused by representativeness?

- People use representativeness to form a judgment about the most likely true process from which the sample they observe is generated and then make predictions based on this perceived true process. People often mistakenly assume that small samples should feature the same essential properties as the true process. (This error is called "the law of small numbers.") For example, although runs of five or six tails are quite possible in a coin-flipping exercise with a fair coin (which is a random walk process with 50/50 odds), people erroneously think that such runs should be extremely rare in a truly random process. Thus, if people know the coin is fair and see a small sample with four or five successive tails, they may think "heads is due" and predict a reversal, to make the sequence look more representative (the gambler's fallacy). However, if people don't know for sure that the true process is 50/50 (fair coin, random walk) they often make the opposite mistake—they use representativeness to infer the process from which the small sample is drawn. In the example with a run of tails, they see something that resembles a trending process so they decide that the true process is trending and predict trend continuation, implicitly or explicitly concluding (against actual evidence) that the coin is unfair.
- Which effect dominates? Availability bias helps distinguish between settings where people become excessively prone to make reversal or continuation predictions. If the true process is salient (e.g., flipping a fair coin), reversal error is common, whereas if the true process is unknown, people extrapolate too much. Real-world financial markets are often characterized by ambiguity, so it is no wonder that individual investors tend to "see trends" and over-extrapolate. Professional investors are better educated about the (near) random walk behavior of asset prices and thus are more confident about the 50/50 process, which makes them more prone to committing the gambler's fallacy.
- Perhaps a broader lesson is that settings with greater uncertainty about the true process (e.g., new assets, limited data, lack of valuation anchors) make investors more prone to extrapolation and markets thus more susceptible to trending (momentum) and to overreactions.

# Conservatism

Conservatism is the tendency of people to underweight new evidence when they update their priors (e.g., by giving insufficient attention to new public data). Anchoring and adjustment is another related bias that can contribute to underweighting new evidence. When people make predictions, they start from some initial value (anchor)—one that can be quite arbitrary if no relevant information is available—and then adjust it to get a final prediction. Such adjustments are typically insufficient and leave final predictions biased toward the anchor.

# Box 6.2. How to reconcile the apparent contradiction in representativeness and conservatism stories

If prior beliefs are viewed as base rate information, conservatism implies overweighting base rate information (and underreacting to new data) whereas representativeness implies base rate neglect (and overreacting to new data). Griffin-Tversky (1992) propose a theory that explains the coexistence of conservatism and representativeness effects. Their thesis is that when making forecasts, people pay too much attention to the strength of the information and too little to its statistical weight, relative to a rational Bayesian investor. (I explain this thesis in greater detail below.) Whether the market underreacts or overreacts to new signals, then, depends on the application setting—in particular, the nature of new information.

- Each piece of information can be judged along two dimensions—strength and weight. Strength is tied to the salience and extremity of the evidence while weight is tied to its statistical reliability, including sample size. For a funny illustration, you are reading a glowing letter of recommendation for a job candidate you are about to hire—and infer a very strong message. However, when you realize that the letter is signed by the candidate's mother, the weight of its informativeness is deflated.
- Conservatism arises in the face of evidence that has low strength but a high weight (e.g., a sample that is large relative to the population); people underreact to such evidence even though the high weight would justify a stronger reaction. On the other hand, representativeness arises when evidence has high strength but low weight (e.g., people "see" a short trend); people pay excessive attention to salient evidence and overreact to it.
- The literature on representativeness and conservatism also suggests the following: people tend to overreact to salient events, concrete anecdotes, good stories, and extreme realizations. They underreact to abstract statistical information, such as sample size or predictive ability, as well as remote events. People often underweight changes in a series unless recent changes are prominent and attributable to a clear cause. If people can associate an observed new data sample with a salient past event or model or, even better, their personal experience, they overweight the new data (representativeness); otherwise, people rely too little on the data and too much on their priors (conservatism). One-time strong news events are likely to generate more overreaction than a sequence of smaller events. Given overconfidence, people probably overreact more easily to private signals (their own research, word of mouth) than to public news. A possible exception: Price trends may be especially attention grabbing, even if they are very public information.

# 6.2.1.2 Self-deception (overconfidence and limits to learning)

There are certain evolutionary benefits in being overconfident. In general, confidence and optimism may give a person energy to strive for challenging goals and may result in more success, happiness, and even longer life. Excessive confidence has some downsides

(e.g., may lead to frequent disappointments) and there is some debate among psychologists about the net benefit. Appearances are especially important for this argument—those able to appear smart and strong are more likely to attract mates and pass on their genes. Self-deception is a part of the story because it is easier to appear competent if you believe in yourself. Overconfident people tend to fail more often than they expect to but nature has provided them with various other biases that help them ignore such feedback and maintain their overconfidence.

# Overconfidence

Overconfidence is a well-documented bias in many contexts. Most of us feel we are above average when it comes to sense of humor, intelligence, car-driving skills, and many other contexts. We also think that we are less prone to behavioral biases than others. (I do, don't you?) Being an expert does not help. More knowledge may even be harmful as it often raises our confidence more than our forecasting ability. Experts in most professions are prone to overconfidence—typically more so than laymen when predictability is low and evidence ambiguous, making feedback inconclusive. Financial professionals are particularly overconfident.

Overconfidence is one key reason for excessive trading volumes but it may also contribute to several asset-pricing regularities. Overconfident investors assign too much weight to information and analysis that they collect or produce themselves, while underweighting public information. The tendency to disregard public information may explain investor underreaction to corporate news, while the high weight placed on one's own experience may contribute to observed momentum and reversal patterns as explained below.

# Overoptimism

Overoptimism is related to both overconfidence in one's own abilities and to wishful thinking. "The future will be great, especially for me." Optimists are prone to an illusion of control; they underrate the role of randomness and they underestimate risks.

# Biased self-attribution

People tend to attribute good outcomes to their own abilities (skill) and bad outcomes to external circumstances (bad luck). This feature feeds overconfidence when people succeed and inhibits learning when people fail. Thus it enables self-deception rather than accurate self-assessment.

# Confirmation bias

We seek evidence that supports our view and we interpret ambiguous evidence as supportive.

# Hindsight bias

Hindsight makes past outcomes, even major surprises, appear virtually inevitable after the fact. ("The market crash was bound to happen.") More personally, memories play tricks on us: we often recall that we had assigned a high likelihood to events that subsequently materialized. ("I knew all along that housing was overpriced.") Hindsight reinforces overconfidence but may also cause regret. By making the past appear more predictable than it really was, hindsight bias fools us into seeing the future as more predictable than it can ever be. Thus the inevitable disappointments that befall investors from time to time are seen, mistakenly, as having been avoidable. The financial media seem especially prone to hindsight and they promote it among the public. Investors underappreciate the degree to which chance (randomness) determines observed outcomes—and this misconception partly explains why active management is so popular, despite its poor record.

# 6.2.2 Preferences

Traditional decision theory analyzes choices between uncertain gambles, the simplest of which are characterized by two possible outcomes and their associated probabilities. People form beliefs, or make judgments, about the probabilities; they assign values, or utilities, to outcomes; and they combine beliefs and values to make decisions. Preferences, in particular attitudes toward risk (quantified as the chooser's degree of risk aversion), determine what choices people make among the various opportunities that exist, given their beliefs. Traditional theory says that people calculate the expected utility of each gamble as the probability-weighted sum of utility outcomes, then choose the gamble with the highest expected utility. This theory has dominated neoclassical economics and finance, but experimental work has found substantial violations of this rational model, leading to the development of various alternative theories. The most famous behavioral alternative is prospect theory (PT).

# Prospect theory

In PT, Kahneman-Tversky (1979) developed an intentionally positive, or descriptive, model of preferences that would best characterize the deviations of actual choices ("what do people really do?") from the normative expected utility model ("what should rational people do?"). It seems likely that PT's key ideas have evolutionary origins in that they reflect quick and intuitive reasoning. The main findings of PT, as revealed in Kahneman and Tversky's experimental studies, are:

—people care more about gains and losses (changes in wealth) than about overall wealth;

- people exhibit loss aversion and can be risk seeking when facing the possibility of loss;
- people overweight low-probability events.

Here is a well-known example from behavioral experiments:

1. Suppose that you are paid 1,000 to participate in a gamble that presents you with the following further choices:

(1A) a sure 500 gain;

 (1B) a 50\% chance of winning $1,000, a 50\% chance of $0.

2. Suppose that you are paid 2,000 to participate in a gamble that presents you with the following further choices:

(2A) a sure 500 loss;

 (2B) a 50\% chance of losing $1,000, a 50\% chance of $0.

The typical strategies chosen in these situations are (1A) (certainty) and (2B) (risk seeking), even though the total wealth outcomes in (1A) and (2A) are identical (you gain 1,500 overall), and the total wealth outcomes in (1B) and (2B) are likewise identical. People act as if they are risk averse when only gains are involved but become risk seeking when facing the possibility of loss and they view the initial bonus and the gamble separately. Such findings, together with the observation that people tend to reject actuarially fair (50/50) gambles, point to loss aversion (losses loom larger than same-sized gains) [1].

Let us look at the specifics. In PT, people maximize the weighted sum of values (utilities) where weights are not probabilities themselves (using the probabilities would be rational) but their nonlinear transformations:

- Whether an outcome is seen as a gain or a loss determines the value (utility) of a dollar (as shown in Figure 6.1a). In other words, a dollar is not worth a dollar; its value depends on the context. The focus on gains and losses rather than on overall wealth is consistent with evaluating each gamble in isolation. If people naturally took into account their whole wealth when considering the offered gambles, they would not reject actuarially advantageous gambles as often as they do.
- The value function is kinked at the origin or the "reference point"; the steeper slope below zero implies loss aversion. Many studies show that losses hurt twice to two and a half times as much as same-sized gains satisfy. Following the example above, the value function has concave (convex) shape to the right (left) of the reference point, implying risk aversion among gambles that involve only gains but risk seeking among gambles that involve only losses.
- Overweighting low-probability events is the main feature of the probability-weighting function (Figure 6.1b). This feature explains the simultaneous demand for both lotteries and insurance, a real-world phenomenon that has puzzled economists who assume rationality. Such overweighting of small probabilities can be strong enough to reverse the sign of risk appetite in the value function. Lotteries that offer a small chance of very large gains can induce risk seeking, despite a general tendency to risk aversion when gambles only involve gains. Conversely, people dislike low-probability large-impact losses so much that they pay up for insurance to avoid such losses (thus implying risk aversion), despite the general risk-seeking tendency that appears when gambles only involve losses [2].

PT simply postulates the leaning S shape of the value function. Novel research proposes an alternative foundation based on salience while using standard risk preferences. According to Bordalo-Gennaioli-Shleifer (2010), decision-makers overweight the likelihood of salient states (where lotteries have extreme, contrasting payoffs), and this can explain both the reflecting shape of the value function and the overweighting of low-probability events. The authors stress that investors only overweight salient low-probability events—a point that may resolve the tension between PT and the idea that black-swan-type low-probability events, events that investors think are nigh impossible or do not think about at all, are underweighted.

PT itself does not generate many testable predictions. It needs to be combined with other assumptions, such as narrow framing or the house money effect (as discussed below).

# Framing effects

One feature of PT preferences is that people derive decision utility from the gains and losses of a single trade. Ignoring the rest of wealth implies narrow framing. Narrow framing involves analyzing problems in too isolated a fashion. It can be caused by the fact that our cognitive resources are limited. Evaluating each trade on a standalone basis is easier and may be more natural than assessing it by its contribution to our total portfolio, as modern portfolio theory prescribes. Thus, many people focus too much on asset-specific risks (volatility, default) and underappreciate correlation effects.

The more general finding in experimental studies is that framing matters. People make different choices depending on how a given problem is presented to them [3]. Mental accounting refers to the process by which people formulate problems for themselves. It involves assigning gains and/or losses related to decisions into separate mental accounts (e.g., expenditure accounts and investment accounts) which may be broad or narrow (narrowness in the extreme being to view each trade in isolation) and which may have different evaluation periods. Decisions may be influenced by the extent to which their outcomes are mentally integrated with, or segregated from, the outcomes of other choices—with other assets in the portfolio or across time (i.e., with the outcomes of past trading).

One important aspect of framing is the selection of a reference point as the benchmark for comparisons. Kahneman and Tversky do not specify this but note that in many cases the status quo (doing nothing, one's current asset position) is a natural reference point:

- For investments already made, the buying price becomes an important reference point against which gains and losses are measured. The disposition effect refers to investors' tendency to hang on to losers, hoping to see the price recover back to the buying level. Prospect theory and mental accounting may explain such reluctance to realize losses. (I recall from my days as a young bond portfolio manager how hard it was to resist this bias even though my colleagues warned me on my first workweek to ignore the purchase price! "The stock does not know that you own it, let alone at what price.")
- The reference point could also be coded with respect to an expected or aspirational level of wealth different from the status quo. Such a difference could reflect incomplete adaptation to recent changes in wealth, so past experiences can matter: "A person who has not made peace with his losses is likely to accept gambles that would be unacceptable to him otherwise." Standard PT is sometimes mistakenly interpreted to say that people become risk seeking after they have lost money but this really depends on framing (as discussed next).

# More risk preferences

The house money effect is an important example of mental accounting. Gamblers tend to become less loss averse and more willing to take risks when they are ahead ("playing with house money"). Greater willingness to gamble after recent gains suggests that losses are easier to take when they can be mentally added to earlier gains. At first blush, this may sound inconsistent with PT. However, PT as described above pertains to one-off gambles. Risk preferences in a sequence of gambles depend on how prior gains and losses influence loss aversion over time. An experimental study by Thaler and Johnson finds evidence in favor of the house money effect—more aggressive risk taking following successful trading, and cautiousness following losses. Such dynamic loss aversion is broadly consistent with wealth-dependent risk aversion. There is one interesting exception to caution after losses: if investors have a chance to fully recover a prior loss, they will accept gambles that they would normally reject. This last feature reflects an apparent desire to "get even" and is related to the disposition effect. Overall, it is hard to make generalizations about risk preferences because they are so sensitive to the framing of investor options.

Ambiguity aversion. People dislike vague uncertainty (ambiguity) more than objective uncertainty. In the classic Ellsberg's paradox, people prefer to take a gamble from an urn containing red and black balls with known 50/50 proportions than from an urn where balls are in unknown proportions, even though the objective probabilities are the same. Such dislike of "unknown unknowns", as compared with "known unknowns" (a distinction first made by Frank H. Knight in 1921) may explain home bias and other observed preferences for familiar investments.

Regret aversion. We may be motivated by the desire to minimize regret (e.g., when hanging on to losers). While risky choices always involve the possibility of adverse outcomes, some outcomes are more likely to trigger regret than others. Regret is often intertwined with hindsight—some decisions are easier to justify ex post than others. Moreover, acts of omission lead to less regret than active efforts (status quo bias); one feels less bad about not buying a stock that went up than about buying a stock that went down. Regret minimization may be a behavioral motivation for diversification (as even Harry Markowitz has suggested from his personal experience).

Moods and feelings sound even more arbitrary as sources of irrational sentiment than the behavioral stories above. Yet moods may be the most plausible explanations for empirical observations that average stock returns tend to be higher near major holidays (Thanksgiving and Christmas in the U.S., Chinese New Year and Japanese Golden Week in Asia, etc.), that U.S. stocks fare better on days with better New York weather, that some calendar year seasonalities appear consistent with seasonal affective disorder, and that lunar cycles and soccer results have some predictive ability on equity markets. Some patterns are likely to be due to data mining and most of these patterns are so weak that they cannot be exploited after trading costs. In contrast, the influence of broad market sentiment—animal spirits—can be huge, and we turn to it next.

# 6.3 APPLICATIONS

Now I turn to applications of behavioral finance. Bubbles and many other observed anomalies can be explained by psychological stories, as well as by alternative, rational, risk-based stories.

# 6.3.1 Speculative bubbles and other macro-inefficiencies

Robert Shiller's book *Irrational Exuberance*, which summarizes his work of over 20 years, was published, with some luck, in March 2000 just at the peak of the equity bubble. Shiller's timing was only slightly off with the second edition which emphasized housing market overvaluation; it came out in 2005, two years before the U.S. real estate bubble burst. Since Shiller's thinking on this topic is as insightful and influential as anyone's, I describe his theory on bubbles before discussing some other analyses.

Shiller argues that equity market bubbles have four elements:

1. Precipitating factors. What gets the bubble started? In the late 1990s, the Internet boom was the most important factor, but other important factors included improving macro-fundamentals (lower inflation and real yields) and the tendency of middle-aged baby-boomers, with high savings rates, to allocate much of their buying to the stock market.
2. Amplification mechanisms. What gets the bubble to propagate? Shiller calls feedback patterns "natural Ponzi schemes" that are the essence of a bubble. Rising prices and the success of some investors attract public attention and heighten expectations for further price rises, raising investor demand. (The high prices are ultimately not sustainable because they are high only because of expectations of further price increases, so the bubble eventually bursts.) Besides simple price-to-price feedback loops, there can also be feedback loops from price to GDP or earnings growth and back to price.
3. Cultural factors. All overvaluations involve appealing stories. Stories surrounding the bubble are important in convincing people why things are different this time. "Major speculative bubbles are always supported by some superficially plausible popular story, a 'new era theory' that is widely viewed as having sanction from some authoritative figure(s)." News media have an essential (often uncritical) role in generating conventional wisdom and setting in motion a sequence of public attentions.
4. Psychological factors. Overconfidence and representativeness (extrapolating from a recent uptrend) are among the individual biases that support the bubble. Herd behavior and other social influences are perhaps even more important. Shiller highlights the power of word-of-mouth transmission, such as personal stories of a neighbor's investment success. Information cascades and "groupthink" are further illustrations of social dynamics: people cannot believe that so many others are wrong, so they ignore their private warning signals.

It is interesting to relate Shiller's description of feedback loops to the "reflexivity theory" of George Sors, one of the pioneers of hedge fund management and still probably the world's most famous hedge fund manager. Sors defines reflexivity as the feedback loop (two-way interaction) between market participants' understanding of their environment and the environment itself. Market prices not only reflect expectations of future outcomes but also shape economic outcomes—and can result in boom-bust cycles. "Financial markets operate with a prevailing bias," Sors writes, "that can validate itself by influencing not only market prices but also the fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect … Beyond a certain point the self-validating feedback loops become unsustainable. That is how reflexivity gives rise to initially self-fulfilling but eventually self-defeating prophesies and processes" (Sors, 2003, p. 5). Sors (2008) argues that 2007–2008 is not only an end to a cyclical housing bubble but also to a more secular super-bubble—decades-long trends of credit creation, globalization of finance, and deregulation—whose underlying misconception was excessive reliance on the market mechanism ("market fundamentalism").

When Soros's The Alchemy of Finance was first published in 1987, academics ignored or dismissed the reflexivity idea, partly because the practitioner-oriented book was written "in a different language". Yet, it has found a large following among investors and it may have also influenced later academic work on positive-feedback trading and on bubbles. Other research also confirms that fast credit growth and financial deregulation/innovation are common characteristics of major booms that end in tears.

Bubbles have a long, infamous history since the Dutch tulip mania (1637) and the South Sea and Mississippi company bubbles (both about 1720). Wall Street in 1929, Japan in 1989, and global technology stocks in 1999 are the most famous equity market bubbles of the past century. Of course, there are alternative explanations for these high equity prices but the explanations involving purely rational stories, such as time-varying risk premia, are unsatisfactory. Credit and real estate bubbles may be even more detrimental to the real economy than equity bubbles, because the former reside closer to the heart of the financial system and may be harder to detect [4].

Three economists besides Shiller warrant mention:

- John Maynard Keynes for such pearls as "Most of our decisions … can only be taken as the result of animal spirits, a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities" and "It is the nature of organized investment markets, under the influence of purchasers largely ignorant of what they are buying and speculators who are more interested in forecasting the next shift of market sentiment than with a reasonable estimate of future yield of capital assets, that, when disillusion falls upon an over-optimistic and over-bought market, it should fall with sudden and catastrophic force." Keynes is also credited with a quote that foreshadows a central argument in the limits-to-arbitrage literature: "The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."
- Hyman Minsky for his insight that financial stability can be destabilizing (because prolonged stable periods make investors extrapolate the stability too far and induce them to overprice risky assets) as well as for his analysis of bubble stages. Each boom starts with displacement (an exogenous shock, akin to Shiller's precipitating factor) that triggers profit opportunities in some sector. Asset prices begin to rise, aided by easy credit (monetary expansion and credit creation—often via financial innovation), and both developments also stimulate the real economy; this is the moment at which stability becomes destabilizing. At the euphoria stage, speculation dominates and any value concerns are dismissed. Eventually euphoria gives way to the critical stage where some insiders take profits and financial distress ensues. The final stage is revulsion—panicky capitulation.
- Lawrence Summers for his pioneering work on the noise trader and limits-to-arbitrage literature. He stressed that market prices, especially the overall market level, can deviate from fundamental values even if we agree that it is hard to beat the market (difficult to profit from such deviations). Summers' commentary during the 2007-2009 crisis, and his academic work 20 years earlier, emphasized the destabilizing potential of various positive-feedback loops (vicious or virtuous cycles) that occasionally overwhelm normal self-stabilizing forces in a market economy.

An equity market bubble is an extreme form of aggregate market overvaluation. Paul Samuelson once conjectured that the stock market is microefficient but macroinefficient—that relative prices are close to being correct but that the overall market level is prone to overvaluations or undervaluations. The limits-to-arbitrage literature buttresses "Samuelson's dictum". Recall the greater risk in arbitrating away overall market valuation: given a lack of close substitutes for a position in the market index, directional equity market or bond market risk cannot be effectively hedged or diversified away. The years 2005-2007 are a good example of a period when microefficiency was high but macroefficiency low (there were few relative value opportunities but all risks were underpriced).

Irrational shifts in investor sentiment can lead to bubbles, crashes, and market overvaluations or undervaluations and thus explain the observed time series predictability of equity market and its excess volatility compared with fundamentals. However, rational time variation in risk premia is an alternative or, more likely, a complementary explanation for such empirical evidence.

The equity premium puzzle refers to the fact that the high historical average return of equities over riskless assets is hard to justify using standard macroeconomic models unless an extremely high risk aversion parameter is used. The behavioral solutions that have been proposed for the puzzle will be discussed in Section 8.2.

Price moves not explained by fundamentals. The EMH suggests that it is very difficult to predict price moves in advance. This certainly is true but it has been embarrassingly difficult to explain price moves even after the fact. We do observe large and logical price moves around corporate announcements and other news. Yet, the overall explanatory power of fundamental news is surprisingly low. Most days' market moves and even many of the biggest daily moves ever observed cannot be linked to obvious fundamental developments. The crash of October 1987 is the prime example; there were several news items but no clear rational trigger to change market valuation by  $20\%$  in the U.S. (45\% in the most affected country, Hong Kong). The most compelling explanations center on the market discount rate—rational stories may be about wealth-dependent risk aversion or learning about other investors' positions, but the irrational story of changing market sentiment seems most plausible (albeit pretty empty in content) [5].

The general volume of trading, arguably overtrading, is also explained more easily by irrationality than by rational models. (Rational models suggest that any news could push prices to new equilibrium levels with minimal trading. Investors' liquidity needs over time would justify only a fraction of the observed trading in equity markets.) Overconfidence and disagreement promote active trading. Volume seems to be positively correlated with market valuations—over time (heavier turnover in booms) and cross-sectionally (greater turnover for glamour or growth stocks and positive-momentum stocks).

Memory biases. Empirically we observe that various risk factors' ex ante excess returns seem to be higher for a long while after a large negative factor shock. This pattern could reflect time-varying risk premia (the perceived amount and/or price of risk is high) or rational learning from the past but it is also suggestive of behavioral memory biases. Our probability assessments are distorted by the availability heuristic in that we tend to overweight strong signals, salient (vivid, emotion-triggering) events, and recent events.

Memories decay only gradually after a major event; this fact might cause attractive reward-to-risk ratios to linger for surprisingly long periods. Famously, the ex ante equity premium remained high for over 20 years after the Great Depression (whereas investor memories were shorter after the 2000-2002 and 2007-2009 bear markets). While financial markets are often criticized for having too short a memory, it is also true that they tend to "keep fighting the previous war".

Fascinating empirical evidence in Malmendier-Nagel's (2010) study of "depression babies" shows how personal experiences and lifetime equity market returns influence investors' equity and bond allocations as well as reported risk aversion across birth cohorts. In the late 1970s, young investors who had only experienced adverse market conditions were more bearish than old investors, while the reverse was true in the late 1990s. During the equity bubble, young mutual fund managers were more likely to buy tech stocks and chase trends than older managers—patterns that had been successful during their (short) personal investing experience.

Other examples of salient events influencing asset prices, possibly due to lingering memories, include the bond risk premium that decayed slowly after the Great Inflation of roughly 1969-1982, the "crash premium" in implied volatilities of equity index options and especially in out-of-the-money put options for 10 to 20 years after the crash of October 19, 1987, and liquidity premia that rose to record highs during the 2007-2008 liquidity drought but came down fast afterwards. In the same vein, investors may require abnormally high interest rates from borrowers for several years after corporate defaults and currency devaluations, and people may buy more earthquake or flood insurance after a recent calamity, despite higher insurance premia ("closing the barn door after the horses have bolted").

Money illusion says that people confuse nominal and real values, perhaps due to anchoring and insufficient adjustment or to limited attention. Economic quantities can be represented in nominal or real terms. The nominal representation is simpler, more salient, and often a reasonable first approximation of real worth (except in hyperinflation situations) even if the real representation is more accurate in capturing true value. Money illusion arises in large part because it is considerably easier and more natural to think in nominal than real terms. The illusion is more common when inflation is relatively low and stable and the costs of this mistake are perceived to be small; people do become more rational and sensitive to inflation during hyperinflations.

Asset prices reflect expected nominal cash flows discounted at nominal rates or expected real cash flows discounted at real rates. Rationally, any shift in inflation should impact the numerator (expected cash flows) of the asset-pricing equation—equation (5.1)—just as much as its denominator (discount rate). However, if some investors mistakenly use nominal rates to discount real cash flows, rising inflation tends to make equities undervalued while falling inflation tends to make them overvalued. This story can explain the low equity market valuations in the 1970s and high valuations in the 1990s. It is unlikely that money illusion was complete, in the sense of all investors making the mistake described above; but an insufficient adjustment for inflation effects is enough to distort market pricing, given the extreme sensitivity of equity prices to their discount rates. The continuing popularity of the "Fed model"—an asset allocation analysis comparing (real) earnings yields with (nominal) bond yields—is suggestive of money illusion.

The money illusion anomaly at the market level is non-diversifiable and slow moving, making it particularly unattractive to arbitrage. Related anomalies have been observed in equity, bond, and housing markets. However, simple money illusion stories are not sufficient to explain all asset price histories: equity market valuations were cheap both in the deflationary 1930s and the inflationary 1970s, while housing markets boomed amidst high inflation in the 1970s and amidst low inflation in the 2000s.

# 6.3.2 Cross-sectional trading opportunities and micro-inefficiency

If the bubble story above says that shifting investor sentiment over time creates periods of overvaluation and undervaluation in the aggregate equity market level that a contrarian market-timer can exploit, then varying investor sentiment across individual stocks creates cross-sectional opportunities that a contrarian stock-picker can exploit. However, short-term market-timers may also join the bandwagon while the bubble keeps growing; and there is a cross-sectional counterpart for this behavior. Specifically, momentum-based stock selection strategies that involve buying recent winners appear profitable. Next, I discuss the literature on value and momentum strategies which initially focused on the U.S. equity market.

Cross-sectional trading strategies may be relatively value-oriented (buy low, sell high) or momentum-oriented (buy rising stocks, sell falling ones; essentially buy high, sell low)—and they may be applied within one market (say, equities) or across many asset markets. Micro-inefficiency refers to either the rare extreme case of riskless arbitrage opportunities or the more plausible case of risky trades and strategies with attractive reward-to-risk ratios. Cross-sectional opportunities are safer to exploit than market-directional opportunities—one can hedge away directional risk and diversify specific risk much more effectively.

The value effect refers to the pattern that "value stocks", those with low valuation ratios (low price/earnings, price/cash flow, price/sales, price/dividend, and price/book value ratios) tend to offer higher long-run average returns than "growth stocks" or "glamour stocks" with high valuation ratios. (These "price/something" ratios or their inverses are together sometimes called scaled price ratios.) Value investing has a long history wherein Benjamin Graham and David Dodd (1934) are seen as the intellectual godfathers. Although academics have documented interesting value-related patterns in stock returns since the 1970s, the topic really caught attention in the early 1990s with two influential publications—Fama-French (1992, henceforth FF) and Lakonishok-Shleifer-Vishny (1994, henceforth LSV).

The two studies presented broadly similar empirical results—portfolios of value stocks earn above-market returns while growth stock portfolios earn below-market returns—but their interpretations were very different. Fama and French interpreted the high average returns of value stocks as rational risk premia for the additional systematic risk of those stocks. In contrast, LSV argued that the success of value strategies reflects their contrarian nature and that the evidence was more consistent with investor irrationality than with a risk-based story. LSV list several common errors that may give rise to the mispricings that contrarian investors can exploit: extrapolating past earnings trend growth too far into the future;

- assuming a trend in stock prices, leading to price overreaction;
- overreacting to good or bad news;
- simply equating a good company with a good investment irrespective of the stock's price.

In Chapter 12, I return to the value effect and to the first error (over-extrapolating and overpaying for the hope of growth), which seems the most important.

Behavioral studies propose further (complementary) explanations. Value stocks typically have achieved their low valuations (low market prices compared with some value metrics) by performing poorly and suffering a price fall. Value strategies require a long investment horizon as value stocks pay off slowly and unevenly; meanwhile some of the companies in a value portfolio look like "dogs" (badly managed companies in declining industries) and are embarrassing to hold. The discomfort may reflect personal considerations (regret aversion if a visible loser keeps underperforming; it is harder in retrospect to justify having held it), social dynamics (herding and conformity biases; there are no great vivid stories for value firms, unlike growth or glamour firms; being a contrarian may feel unfashionable and even anti-social). For professional managers there are also agency issues and career concerns ("no one gets fired for holding IBM or Microsoft"). Finally, small-growth stocks may have lottery-ticket-like characteristics that make them overpriced [6].

# Momentum and reversal, overreaction and underreaction

Behavioral finance theorists turned in the 1990s to the library of psychological biases to explain various empirical regularities uncovered since the mid-1980s. The most important biases pointed to both momentum and reversal effects:

- DeBondt-Thaler (1985) found a long-term reversal effect—stocks that had underperformed in the previous 12 to 36 months tended to subsequently outperform the market. The authors attributed long-term reversal to investor overreaction—the reversal part represented a correction after excessive overvaluation or undervaluation. (This long-term reversal is related to the value effect in that multi-year underperformers typically had become value stocks with attractive scaled price ratios.)
- Jegadeesh-Titman (1993) found a short to medium-term momentum effect—stocks that had outperformed in recent months tended to keep outperforming up to 12 months ahead [7]. Such momentum may be related to buildup of the overreaction found by DeBondt and Thaler, and which reverted after 12 months. But there is also an alternative underreaction story, given growing evidence of market underreactions to discretionary corporate announcements. The classic example was post-earnings-announcement drift: after a sharp move on the announcement day, stock prices tended to move gradually over several months in the same direction as the initial reaction, suggesting slow adaptation to new information. Such apparent underreactions could also contribute to price momentum.
- The above effects are cross-sectional relations across equities. In addition, time series evidence suggests that many financial time series exhibit positive autocorrelation over short horizons and (albeit less consistently) negative autocorrelation over multi-year horizons. I will show later that trend-following strategies are profitable for many risky assets in the short run, while value strategies, which may in part rely on long-term (relative) mean reversion, are profitable in the long run. Momentum and value strategies also appear to be profitable when applied across countries, within other asset classes, and across asset classes (global tactical asset allocation). However, the time horizons required for successful strategies in other contexts do not always match the time horizons that are profitable for comparable strategies within equity markets.

The combination of momentum patterns up to 12 months followed by reversal patterns beyond 12 months was a challenge that seemed better suited to behavioral finance than to traditional (rational) finance. Different academic teams soon developed alternative models that rely on different behavioral errors, or other mechanisms, to explain observed momentum and reversal patterns. I review the four most prominent models:

- DeLong et al. (1990) developed the first formal model that predicted both short-term momentum and long-term reversal. The model focused on the interaction of noise traders and arbitrageurs. The study simply posits that noise traders follow positive-feedback strategies (buying recent winners and selling recent losers), which could reflect extrapolative expectations, stop-loss orders, margin calls, portfolio insurance, or wealth-dependent risk aversion or sentiment. Arbitrage need not always be stabilizing; it may be rational for arbitrageurs to jump on the bandwagon and push prices further away from fundamental values. Positive-feedback trading clearly creates short-term momentum and price overreaction. The eventual return toward fundamental values creates long-term price reversal. Subsequent studies present more detailed behavioral motivations as to why investors follow positive-feedback strategies.
- The Barberis-Shleifer-Vishny (1998) model is motivated by two heuristic biases: conservatism and representativeness. Conservatism bias makes investors underreact to economic announcements and other public news, giving rise to price momentum as well as post-event continuation patterns. Representativeness can cause overreactions and subsequent long-run reversals. One aspect of representativeness is that investors seek, and can see, patterns in truly random series. The model focuses on investor reaction to public information. The model assumes that earnings streams follow a random walk; yet investors mistakenly believe that observed earnings come from either of two regimes—a normal mean-reverting regime or a momentum regime—and they switch back and forth between the two mindsets. They try to infer the prevailing regime from the data, predicting earnings reversals when they believe that normal conditions apply, but extrapolating apparent earnings trends when they observe a string of same sign shocks and infer that a momentum regime is more likely. The first type of mistake (proxying for conservatism) leads to price underreactions and momentum, while the second type of mistake leads to (delayed) price overreactions. Because the true earnings process is a random walk, the extrapolating investor will eventually be disappointed, resulting in long-term price reversal and value effects [8].
- The Daniel-Hirshleifer-Subrahmanyam (1998) model relies on different behavioral biases—overconfidence and self-attribution bias regarding investors' private information (see Section 6.2.1). Investors do their own research to come up with active views about an asset's value. For example, if their private view is that a stock is undervalued they will overconfidently buy and push up its price. When public news subsequently arrives and allows investors to re-evaluate their original private view and its accuracy, biased self-attribution helps them boost or retain overconfidence (recall the asymmetry—good outcomes reflect one's own skill, bad outcomes reflect bad luck). If subsequent public news is consistent with their bullish view, they will become more overconfident and push up the price further. If subsequent public news disconfirms the bullish private view, attribution bias makes them underweight such conflicting news. Such investor behavior creates a short-term momentum effect through price overreaction, followed by more overreaction, and eventually long-term reversal. (The model implies overreaction to private signals but underreaction to public news.) A further reason for observed return predictability is that company managements take advantage of mispricings, due to investor overconfidence, by "timing" their issuance of stock to match times of overvaluation and their buybacks to times of undervaluation.
- The Hong-Stein (1999) model relies on the interaction between two not-fully-rational investor groups—newswatchers and momentum traders—under conditions of heterogeneous information. Slow diffusion of private information across newswatchers creates underreaction and momentum effects. When momentum traders observe trends, they jump on the bandwagon, hoping to profit from the continued diffusion of information. However, their own activity generates further momentum and causes prices to overreact beyond fundamental values. Eventually, a reversal ensues.

These four models rely on different behavioral stories. All explain long-term reversal as a return toward fundamental values following an overreaction. However, their explanations for momentum differ. In the first two models, momentum is generated by overreaction and more overreaction whereas in the latter two models, it is initially generated by underreaction and only later by overreaction.

One other behavioral bias has been found to cause and exacerbate momentum. Recall that the disposition effect refers to investors' reluctance to realize small losses ("get-evenitis"). People are willing to take on gambles they would not otherwise accept if these might permit them to make up for losses. Empirical studies show that both individual investors and mutual funds tend to hang on to losing stocks (being more willing to sell small winners than small losers), against the trader maxim "cut your losses, let your profits run" and despite the tax advantage pointing to the opposite action. It appears that experience can reduce this bias; the fact that real estate is traded infrequently may thus make real estate investors especially prone to this bias, because such investors have fewer learning opportunities.

The disposition effect can generate stock price momentum and predictable post-event continuation effects such as post-earnings-announcement drift. Data on stock turnover or on investor holdings help to identify the stocks most prone to underreactions. The difference between the current market price and current equity holders' average buying price (which serves as an aggregate reference point for gains and losses) is crucial and needs to be estimated. If most current holders bought the stock well above current market levels (so that they have large unrealized capital losses), disposition-biased investors will be slow to sell assets and any bad news will travel slowly (into the market price). Conversely, if most current holders bought the stock well below current market levels (so that they have large unrealized capital gains), disposition-biased investors will be quick to sell assets and any good news will travel slowly.

# 6.4 CONCLUSION

Behavioral finance implies that market prices do not only reflect the rationally expected discounted cash flows from an asset. Shifting asset demands from irrational investors influence market prices and expected returns. If there is some mispricing—overvaluation or undervaluation—then that should disappear over time. Active investors can exploit such mispricing and earn alpha through security selection across assets and maybe also through market timing over time.

Five points are worth noting:

- First, because we cannot directly observe expected returns, there has been considerable debate as to how much time series or cross-sectional predictability of returns really exists. On this question, the consensus academic view has changed over time from "not much at all" to "surprisingly much … but less than published studies suggest (because of data mining) and any predictability still is not easy to exploit."
- Second, academics in the behavioralist camp may not stress the last point loudly enough! The limits-to-arbitrage literature highlights how difficult it can be to take advantage of market inefficiencies—especially macro-inefficiencies. Yet, this is hardly the message most active investors take away from behavioral finance. Although the behavioral finance literature may have the benign intent of helping investors correct their own mistakes, I suspect its readers have focused more on potential profits from exploiting other people's systematic errors. In this way, the field may do a disservice by promoting active trading among investors who already are overtrading and need no further encouragement. It is probably not too cynical to observe that both the buy sides and sell sides of the financial industry have harnessed behavioral finance as a potent intellectual justification for active management and thus took better advantage of behavioral finance lessons than their customers did.
- Third, there is some evidence that asset market regularities become weaker or fully disappear after they have been published (due to both data mining and investor learning; only the former implies that the opportunity never really was there). Hedge fund alphas also seem to have edged lower in the past decade. One interpretation is that markets gradually became more (micro) efficient, reflecting learning by arbitrageurs (who exploit any identified regularities or mispricings) as well as growing arbitrage capacity. This trend reversed in 2007–2008. As market liquidity and arbitrage conditions deteriorated, apparent mispricings and market frictions increased. There was clearly less arbitrage capital available, as attempts to arbitrage the mispricings often resulted in losses as de-leveraging made cheap assets even cheaper. There is one problem with this story: it is hard to argue that, with abundant arbitrage capital, the market was fully efficient in 2006–2007. Perhaps fewer relative mispricings and underreactions existed but a general underpricing of risk distorted most asset prices. More generally, abundant risk capital, flush liquidity, and easy access to leverage may reduce micro-inefficiencies but boost macro-inefficiencies in a Minskyan sense.
- Fourth, virtually any observed predictability pattern can be interpreted to reflect either irrational mispricings or rational time-varying risk premia (or rational learning about structural changes). On this question, there is little agreement among academics. Some argue that the matter may be inherently unresolvable by empirical evidence; the answer will always depend on prior views. Fortunately, the religious tones in this debate have subsided over time and an agnostic view may have become more common. It is likely that both irrational and rational forces drive asset prices and expected returns, and we can argue about the relative contributions of the two for any given regularity, without expecting to find a conclusive answer. "Both matter" is an unsatisfactory answer to those academics who want to take sides and find the most parsimonious model to explain asset price behavior, but in reality both really do matter.
- Fifth, critics argue that behavioral finance lacks discipline. The field offers too many good stories—at least one psychological explanation for every empirical regularity. This criticism hits home, but it also applies to the widening menu of rational explanations for each regularity.

# 6.5 NOTES

[1] The second feature could also reflect classic risk aversion—diminishing marginal utility of wealth. However, loss aversion seems a more plausible explanation given the finding that expected utility maximizers should act in an almost risk-neutral fashion over small-stake gambles unless they exhibit absurdly high risk aversion over larger stakes. For example, an expected utility maximizer who turns down a 50/50 bet of "gain $110/lose $100" should also turn down a 50/50 bet of "gain $1 billion/lose $1,000." (Technically speaking, the utility function in the expected utility framework is nearly linear—risk neutral—locally but exhibits more curvature—risk aversion—for larger gambles.) In contrast, the kink of PT's value function at zero easily explains people's aversion to small-stake gambles.

[2] Prospect theory and its extensions also highlight the "certainty effect" in the probability-weighting function: people put much greater value on the complete elimination of a hazard than on a reduction in its probability. The following example gives compelling intuition. You are forced to play Russian roulette but can buy yourself the right to remove a single bullet from the gun before it is fired. Would the amount you are willing to pay depend on the total number of bullets in the gun? Most people would pay more for removing the only bullet if only one chamber was loaded ("fully removing the risk") or for removing one bullet if all six chambers were loaded ("giving a chance"), compared with what they would pay if they could merely reduce the probability of death from 4/6 to  $3/6$ . This example explains vividly why the weighting curve is shallower at intermediate probabilities than near either extreme. It also underscores the fact that the weighting function may not refer to mistaken probabilities; in the above example people understand the probabilities correctly but value highly the shift from "no chance" to a possibility. In the more mundane world of finance, the certainty effect may explain the popularity of various capital-guaranteed products (and retain investors' willingness to overpay for them). The steepness of the probability-weighting function at very low and very high (but not quite extreme) probabilities is complicated by one more feature. Extremely low probabilities are treated as impossibilities ("rounded down") and extremely high probabilities as certainties ("rounded up"). Thus, in some contexts low-probability events may be underweighted (as in the black swan idea) and not overweight (as in prospect theory).

[3] The classic example is preference reversal when the same question is posed in terms of lives saved vs. people dying if a new program is adopted. The fact that framing influences decisions contradicts the basic tenets of expected utility theory.

[4] A Chicago School view is that bubbles are mostly visible in retrospect. People identify bubbles with hindsight—assets were overpriced because they subsequently fell. While valuations were high there were both buyers and sellers; market mispricing was more contentious in real time. An extreme (and not widely held) version of this position is that bubbles do not exist. I believe that they do.

[5] One culprit for the 1987 crash was so-called portfolio insurance activity. This strategy was a popular way of protecting portfolio value through dynamic trading—essentially selling risk assets when markets fell. Note the close parallels between wealth-dependent risk aversion in Figure 5.2 and portfolio insurance that tried to ensure a certain subsistence level. During the crash the insurance strategy failed because counterbalancing buyers failed to materialize and the market gapped lower.

[6] Lottery ticket preference: Overweighting of small probabilities may explain the low average returns for IPOs and small growth stocks (growth options, great stories)—these are akin to (buying) lottery tickets. Overpaying for lotteries may also partly explain the high prices and low expected returns of equity index options (especially out-of-the-money options) and of the most volatile securities within each asset class. The observed high average returns of carry strategies and volatility-selling strategies are also consistent with this story, as are the observed long shot bias in horse race betting and the particular popularity or overpricing of lotteries with the most extreme payoffs. Lottery ticket preferences are linked to general skewness preferences (see Section 19.4).

[7] Yet other studies found a very-short-term reversal effect—especially sharp for the first few days but strong enough that even portfolios of last month's outperformers tended to underperform in the subsequent month. Few behavioral models try to explain this effect, although short-term overreactions to salient news are a possibility. More common explanations are related to market frictions: the so-called bid-ask bounce and temporary price concessions for large trades.

[8] In the spirit of the Griffin-Tversky (1992) distinction between the strength and weight of information (see Box 6.2), investors may ignore the high weight of fresh earnings information but overweight consistent multi-year patterns (a salient but unreliable signal given the mean reversion tendency in growth rates).

Source notes. Behavioral finance is such a diverse field that when trying to give some structure to this chapter I have benefited from several previous surveys. For one overall survey of this field, I would recommend Barberis-Thaler (2003). For a survey emphasizing the limits to arbitrage, pick Shleifer's (2000) book Inefficient Markets; for one focusing on investor psychology, pick Hirshleifer (2001); for one covering speculative bubbles, pick Shiller's (2000) book Irrational Exuberance. Other useful books include Shefrin's Beyond Greed and Fear (2002), Montier's Behavioral Investing (2007), Zweig's Your Money and Your Brain (2008) as well as the superb collections of major academic articles in this field in Thaler (1993, 2005) Advances in Behavioral Finance I-II and Kahneman and Tversky (2000) Choices, Values and Frames.

I follow the structure of the Barberis-Thaler (2003) in treating limits to arbitrage and psychology separately, and in the latter section distinguishing systematic errors in beliefs (judgment biases) and errors in preferences. However, my classification mixes in Hirshleifer's (2001) argument that heuristic simplification and self-deception together provide a unified explanation for most of the judgment and decision biases identified in experimental psychology.

On the limits to arbitrage, Shleifer-Vishny (1997) is the classic article, while on psychology and prospect theory the definitive paper is Kahneman-Tversky (1979). Among other works, I allude to Griffin-Tversky (1992) on representativeness/conservatism; Taleb (2001) and Zweig (2008) on hindsight bias; Bordalo-Gennaioli-Shleifer (2010) on salience theory; Shefrin-Statman (1985), Odean (1998), and Frazzini (2006) on disposition effect; Thaler-Johnson (1990) on the house money effect; and Ellsberg (1961) on ambiguity aversion.

Turning to applications, besides Shiller's book *Irrational Exuberance*, I highlight the writings of Keynes (1936), Minsky (1986), and Soros (2003, 2008). McCulley (2010) has been one of Minsky's main posthumous ambassadors. Jung-Shiller (2005) contrast macroefficiency vs. microefficiency, and Malmendier-Nagel (2010) discuss generational memory effects. On money illusion I highlight Modigliani-Cohn (1979), on value effect Fama-French (1992) and Lakonsihok-Shleifer-Vishny (1994), on momentum/reversal effects DeBondt-Thaler (1985) and Jegadeesh (1993), and on explaining them DeLong et al. (1990), Barberis-Shleifer-Vishny (1998), Daniel-Hirshleifer-Subrahmanyam (1998), and Hong-Stein (1999).

# Alternative interpretations for return predictability

- Observed return predictability over time can reflect time-varying risk premia, market inefficiency, or a mirage. Parallel interpretations (rational, irrational, noise) exist to explain large average return differences across assets.
- Each interpretation has different investment implications. However, it is often impossible to empirically distinguish these explanations from one another, and they may all matter.
- "Mirage" is my catch-all term for explanations that do not imply investment opportunities for the future: data mining and selection biases, peso problems and learning, market frictions and structural changes.

# 7.1 RISK PREMIA OR MARKET INEFFICIENCY

The two main competing explanations for return predictability are time-varying risk premia and market inefficiency. (As a cross-sectional parallel to time series predictability, abnormally high average returns for certain assets or investment strategies also have both rational and irrational explanations.) The two alternatives are often empirically indistinguishable and a spirited debate about them has persisted for over two decades. In reality both explanations likely have contributed to observed regularities. These two explanations have been discussed in the previous chapters, so I keep things brief here.

Time-varying risk premia may reflect either assets' changing riskiness or investors' changing risk aversion over time—or both. Either way, time-varying opportunities may not justify active trading for an investor who is similar to the market. Buying opportunities tend to be greater in bad times just when the risk or risk aversion is commensurately higher. Contrarian market timing is not for everyone (and cannot be—or contrarian investors would have no one to trade with). Investors who differ from the market by having a longer investment horizon and greater risk tolerance than most investors may be natural risky asset buyers during bad times when valuations are attractive. (This last statement is based more on strong intuition than on existing theoretical models; see note 5 in Chapter 28.)

Time-varying risk premia can generate a "discount rate effect": changes in the market's required returns cause opposite-signed moves in realized returns. This effect makes extrapolation of past returns doubly dangerous. Falling required returns (whether due to lower market volatility or lower risk aversion) can boost in-sample average returns. For example, the high realized equity returns in the 1990s were a sign of lower ex ante returns, a fact that return-chasing investors missed at the time. In addition, if investors learn gradually about assets' changing riskiness, a delayed discount rate effect can contaminate the observed short-term risk-reward relation and even flip its sign at first (recall the mixed evidence relating volatility to expected return).

Market inefficiencies caused by behavioral biases should have a predictable lifecycle: dwindling opportunity once the inefficiency becomes well known. (Time-varying risk premia should not have any such predictable lifecycle.) If smart investors find out about inefficiencies, they want to exploit them and may arbitrage them away. However, arbitrage capital is sometimes insufficient to eliminate such opportunities. Recent years have clearly shown that the availability of arbitrage capital varies over time, and that the amount of arbitrage capital available is clearly insufficient to eliminate all inefficiencies.

Arbitrage capital may be scarcer for slow-moving and hard-to-diversify macro-opportunities (market-directional trades) than for micro-opportunities (relative value trades). The flipside is that the latter are more likely to become crowded and capacity constrained. Regularities based on underreaction-to-news effects may also be more easily arbitraged away than value and momentum effects. Finally, some market inefficiencies have arguably transformed into systematic risk factors; for example, equity value style and currency carry style alphas have over time morphed into betas, which may imply more persistent rewards.

# 7.2 DATA MINING AND OTHER "MIRAGE" EXPLANATIONS

There are several explanations for market regularities besides the above two. Data mining is the best known, but I also mention peso problems, learning, market frictions, and the changing world. I call all of these explanations mirages because whatever predictability was observed in the past was sample specific and/or has no investment value for the future. Here is some color on each explanation.

# Data mining (also called data snooping, overfitting, or selection bias)

Any interesting empirical regularities could be spurious (which does not mean that they all are). When thousands of academics and practitioners study the same historical dataset, all motivated to find profitable strategies, they (we) are bound to uncover many empirical relations that just happened to work well in sample and fail miserably out of sample. Overfitting can be unintentional—the summed outcome of many apparently minor choices in developing, refining, and combining trading strategies—but the cumulative impact can be large. Data-mining biases are innate in us but academics' incentive to publish and practitioners' incentive to attract capital make them worse. Advances in computing power and data access compound these effects. Finally, the tendency of negative findings (that a tested-for effect does not exist) to go unpublished accentuates the impact of data mining:

- We should recognize the reality that any simulated (backtest) performance presented to us likely overstates future prospects. By how much? Statistical techniques exist to quantify the degree of data mining but they are accurate only if researchers work in a vacuum. In reality, any empirical analysis is influenced by past experience and literature, and this collective heritage cannot be measured.
- Overfitting bias is so insidious that we cannot eliminate it (we cannot "become virgins again" and forget our knowledge), but we can mitigate its impact. In theory, the best approach is to use pure out-of-sample data from actual investing. However, it is often impractical to wait for the slow accumulation of fresh data, especially when competitive pressures push us to implement the best possible model now. (Judging that any decay in out-of-sample performance is due to overfitting is also questionable. Such decay could be sample specific or could reflect learning by investors, or structural breaks.)
- Besides out-of-sample analysis, other ways to mitigate overfitting bias include requiring a certain economic logic from regularities (incorporating economic priors is useful but in reality they too reflect our experience); conducting cross-validation exercises (testing findings on a dataset other than the one used for fitting the model); extensive robustness checks (subperiod consistency, etc.); and being simple in model specification and conservative in parameter estimation. On the last theme, academics often use "predictive" models with in-sample coefficient estimates although estimates could not have been known to real-time investors until the end of the sample. Even if we remedy this problem by using rolling coefficients based on available data, the set of indicator variables in a model was likely selected with hindsight. Dynamically selecting indicators and/or models from a large pool of candidates would be less hindsight but is data intensive and slow to respond to any changes in the market environment.

Reporting biases apply to actively managed funds and are close cousins to selection biases among simulated paper strategies. Data-mining bias involves selecting attractive trading strategies among many variants that have been backtested on paper. Actively managed funds (mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.) have a real-world track record but those being offered to investors are selected from a larger pool and are hardly representative of the whole pool, the poor performers among which are either shut down or their performance is not reported. Given well-known evidence that fund flows tend to follow good performance, it makes sense that fund marketing focuses on past winners and that past losers tend to fall by the wayside. In the mutual fund industry, fund families offer and incubate a diverse selection of funds, in part to ensure that they have some recent winners to use in marketing. Biases are larger in industries with voluntary reporting: databases purportedly describing the whole industry can overstate industry returns due to survivorship bias, backfill bias, and other biases (see Section 11.3). These caveats are more relevant to forming a skeptical assessment of high average returns than they are for critiquing findings of time series predictability.

# Peso problem

Return regularities may also reflect an abnormal or unrepresentative sample period (say, 2003-2007). The peso problem refers to the difficulty of assessing time series that are plagued by important rare events which may or may not be realized in sample—closely linked to fat tails and black swans (see Rogoff, 1980; Taleb, 2007) [1]. Peso problems are especially important when we interpret the performance of assets or strategies with asymmetric return distributions. If a rare adverse event to which the market assigns a low probability does not materialize during the sample period, selling insurance against such an event appears highly profitable. Just consider the absence of double-digit equity market crashes after October 1987 and the persistent profitability of selling out-of-the-money put options over the two decades following the crash. More generally, risky asset returns have benefited from events that did not happen although they could have happened. Headline examples include no depression after the 1930s as well as no destructive wars or hyperinflations in advanced countries after the 1940s. Likewise, emerging market returns have been boosted in recent decades by surprisingly few devaluations and sovereign defaults. Hindsight bias makes investors especially prone to being misled by peso problems. The role of luck or randomness in observed outcomes is underappreciated; whatever happened seems predictable and even inevitable, ex post.

# Learning

Rational learning amidst structural uncertainty can lead to statistical evidence of predictable returns that is indistinguishable from the impact of irrational expectations. For example, the Treasury bond market apparently underpredicted inflation in the 1960s and 1970s (it was repeatedly surprised by higher inflation) and then overpredicted inflation in the 1980s and 1990s (it made the opposite systematic forecasting errors). With hindsight, we know that the inflation process underwent a structural change (higher, more volatile, more persistent inflation) and that the process was later reversed, but real-time bond investors could only learn about this development gradually. The long bull trend in emerging market assets amidst a gradual improvement in emerging market fundamentals is another example where data are consistent with investor irrationality as well as rational learning. Peso problems and learning stories help in interpreting past return predictability but contain no lessons about future profit opportunities.

# Market frictions

Most academic predictability evidence is presented without taking into account trading costs and other market frictions. It is not surprising, then, that paper profits tend to be most consistent in illiquid assets (e.g., small-cap stocks) or in trading styles that involve high turnover (e.g., short-term reversal). Faced with evidence of profitable trading strategies, it is always reasonable to question whether trading cost estimates (including both direct costs and market impact) have been understated. Fortunately, newer studies increasingly adjust profits for trading costs, financing costs, short-selling constraints, and other market frictions. While the limits-to-arbitrage literature explains why speculative capital is generally scarce, these adjustments explain why certain paper regularities are harder to exploit in practice than others. Only market-makers and other efficient low-cost traders can take advantage of such opportunities, and even then, only on a limited scale.

# Changing world

Past success can prove ephemeral without implying that potential predictable profits never were there in the first place (as other mirage explanations imply). Some strategies truly were exploitable in the past but then the world changed. In some cases, one can easily identify the structural breaks that removed the profitability—for example, the inception of the European Monetary Union, decimalization of price change increments in stock exchanges, or the introduction of Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure). In other cases (e.g., many underreaction effects and arbitrage strategies) greater competition gradually eroded market inefficiencies. Financial regularities are fragile because any highly profitable regularity attracts competition.

Of course, we cannot observe directly which of these alternative forces push(es) asset prices around. When investors face a sharp and/or sustained underperformance of a previously successful strategy, it is incredibly difficult to decide whether or not to give up on the strategy or, instead, even double-down. Extrapolative biases, learning from history, stop-loss discipline or other risk control, and sheer pain avoidance point to cutting losses (but if losses turn out to be temporary, these occasions provided good entry opportunities that were missed). The response depends on the perceived cause of recent underperformance. If the investor believes that the source of long-run profits is a sustainable risk premium, it is easier to tough it out than if the investor fears that past success may have been a mirage (overfitting, peso problem, etc.) or that the source of profits has been eroded. Data provide limited assistance. Even when we can formulate the question well, there are no easy answers.

# 7.3 NOTES

[1] For example, too few rare disasters may have occurred during the historical window studied compared with what the markets anticipated. The name derives from the experience of the Mexican peso that had been pegged to the U.S. dollar between 1955 and 1976 but consistently sold at a forward discount (Mexican yields were higher). Investors may have rationally assigned a small probability of a large devaluation through this period but its timing was highly uncertain. Until the rare event (devaluation) materialized in 1976, forward rates were biased predictors of future spot exchange rates and carry strategies were highly profitable.
