# Endogenous return and risk: Feedback effects on expected returns

- Feedback loops can amplify market movements if market participants respond to past performance. Irrational extrapolation may have evolutionary origins. Virtuous and vicious cycles may also reflect rational forces, such as wealth-dependent risk aversion, leverage cycles, and liquidity spirals.
- Such dynamics are especially powerful when applied to market direction (booms and busts) but they can also be overlaid on the performance of any asset or strategy. Presumably, they contribute to both short-term momentum and long-term reversal patterns observed for many assets.
- Recent success can make any asset or strategy more popular over time and thereby also more risky (beta like), especially when a number of years pass between realization of negative risk events. Crowdedness raises liquidation risks and makes the return stream more negatively skewed. Currency carry strategies and the August 2007 quant crisis are good illustrations.

The 12 case studies above contain limited discussion about market dynamics. However, an important feature of financial market regularities is that market participants tend to respond to past performance, often herding into recently successful strategies. Imitating success, or learning, may have been an evolutionarily useful approach for our ancestors, and thus hardwired into us, but in modern financial markets this tendency may be unhealthy, even dangerous. Such feedback effects make asset returns and risks endogenous. That is, the market's expected returns at least partly come from within: the subject is not independent of the observer. When market participants observe realized asset returns it influences their actions and thereby market prices—thus also affecting future returns and risks. As the market's expected returns are unobservable, many investors overextrapolate past realized returns, missing the notion that higher past returns can be indicative of lower future returns.

# 20.1 FEEDBACK LOOPS ON THE DIRECTION OF RISKY ASSETS

The partially endogenous nature of returns is especially important at the aggregate market level because, even if wealth gains do not make investors more optimistic about future cash flows, they can make investors more risk tolerant and lenders more willing to offer leverage. As discussed in the context of market bubbles in Section 6.3.1, such feedback loops amplify market moves even if they eventually prove self-defeating. These ideas echo Soros' reflexivity principle, which states that market prices not only reflect expectations of future outcomes but also shape economic outcomes through a feedback loop (see Section 6.3). When the boom turns into a bust, virtuous cycles turn vicious. Lawrence Summers has noted that, when multiple vicious cycles operate simultaneously and reinforce each other, normal self-stabilizing mechanisms in the market economy ("the genius of capitalism") may be overwhelmed. This is clearly what happened in 2007-2008. Besides irrational sentiment (animal spirits, the cycle of fear and greed) and extrapolation of recent performance, as well as feedback loops between the real economy and financial markets, here are several rational and purely financial mechanisms that boost procyclicality:

- time-varying risk premia due to wealth-dependent risk aversion or risk (falling wealth, and rising volatilities and/or correlations, raise required returns with the result that today's asset prices need to fall);
- leverage/loss/margin spirals (losses prompt financial intermediaries to shrink their own balance sheets, while margin calls due to losses, higher "haircuts", and investor redemptions force hedge funds and other levered customers to reduce positions, with the result that selling pressure pushes risky assets even lower);
- liquidity spirals (waning trust and worsening funding conditions cause forced liquidations; a synchronous rush for the exit causes market liquidity to potentially dry up);
- risk control spirals (VaR-based risk management, stop-loss rules, portfolio insurance strategies, and mark-to-market accounting combined with regulatory and rating pressures lead to risk reduction when market prices fall and measured volatilities and/or correlations rise).

Recent research emphasizes the interactions between these various mechanisms as well as the central role of financial intermediaries and their funding constraints. Higher volatility pushes haircuts higher and thereby hurts funding liquidity. The wealth effect makes the demand responses of leveraged investors for risky assets upward sloping and their supply responses amidst meltdowns downward sloping. Higher leverage expands the economy's risk-bearing capacity, procyclicality, and systemic risks. Position unwinds can suddenly transform stabilizing arbitrageurs (liquidity suppliers) into destabilizing liquidators (liquidity demanders). Combining leverage and illiquid assets is particularly dangerous because, when credit conditions tighten, distressed selling of crowded positions is more likely to occur at fire sale prices.

While the procyclical responses listed above can make sense individually for each institution, collectively such actions exacerbate market moves and make most investors worse off. In general, a heterogeneous ecology of investment approaches would make financial markets more balanced and robust than what we have seen in recent years. Perold-Sharpe (1988) discussed two mirroring dynamic investment approaches—buying risky assets as they fall (and selling them as they rise) vs. selling risky assets as they fall (and buying them when they rise). Today we call these approaches contrarian (reversal) and momentum (trend-following) strategies. Contrarian strategies are inherently market stabilizing while momentum strategies are destabilizing. The balance between the sizes of the two groups is essential for market behavior. We saw this in 2008 when falling wealth and rising risk aversion prompted most investors to reduce risky asset holdings—and value-oriented buyers failed to appear to the scene.

Perold and Sharpe stressed that when contrarian strategies succeed for a while, they attract followers and markets may become too stable (too slow to adjust to economic developments). Conversely, when momentum strategies succeed for a while, they attract new followers and markets may become too volatile (overreacting to economic news). In the post-crisis environment of 2010 we clearly are in the latter situation where "everyone is a risk manager" and stop-loss approaches are popular (stop-loss limits imply selling into weakness). However, as the authors emphasized, excess popularity of one approach eventually results in excess gains for the opposite style, a process which over time should drive the relative sizes of the two groups toward a balance.

At the time of writing (mid-2010), a less momentum-oriented approach also seems consistent with the other lesson of the past decade: contrarian market timing can add value over long horizons—especially if regulators are more keen than before to create countercyclic buffers and central bankers to lean against the wind. I suspect that investors will turn to this second lesson only if we see very large market moves and glaring value opportunities. The "buy on dips" mentality has been discredited in the current investor generation's mind, unless the dip is very deep.

# 20.2 FEEDBACK LOOPS ON LESS DIRECTIONAL POSITIONS

Feedback loops also matter beyond market-directional exposures. Similar return-chasing dynamics can be overlaid on the performance of any return source. Fluctuating fortunes and fashionability may explain the prevalence of short-term momentum and long-term reversal patterns observed in the return series of many financial assets and trading strategies (see Figure 20.1). These dynamics may also make any successful strategy more beta like and its return more asymmetric ("up the stairs, down the escalator"), with scant fundamental reason.

The first bar shows the (auto)correlation between adjacent month returns for each major asset class or strategy that I cover in this book (i.e., short-term momentum of the asset class or strategy). The second bar shows the correlation between the latest 6-month return and the 6-month return 18 months earlier, measuring "long-term" reversal. I present evidence only for the 1990s and 2000s because data availability is better for a broad set of assets during this period and because this period gives us pure out-of-sample results compared with the first studies reporting such speculative dynamics (Cutler-Poterba-Summers, 1991) [1]. Across the investments in Figure 20.1, average short-term momentum is  $+0.20$  and average long-term reversal is  $-0.11$ . The evidence on short-term momentum is especially compelling although a part of it may reflect illiquidity and return smoothing. (Even the two exceptions with mild negative autocorrelations here—commodity trend following and the size effect in U.S. equities—have mild positive autocorrelations over longer sample periods.)

More fundamentally, analysts' earnings forecasts exhibit similar short-term momentum and long-term reversal patterns. Ghayur et al. (2010) argue that this is the main reason for the success of momentum and value strategies.

For illustration, let us consider the evolution of a profitable investment strategy—say, FX carry or harvesting illiquidity premia. Figure 20.2 shows a stylized lifecycle of the ex ante Sharpe ratio. Once the strategy's past success attracts widespread attention, it triggers profit-seeking inflows through extrapolation or learning. Inflows may temporarily boost profitability but growing competition gradually eats up the ex ante opportunity, while the realized return remains deceivingly good. In the absence of good forward-looking anchors, the expected return may even become negative, due to overvaluation and overcrowded positions. The liquidation phase is likely to wait until broader bad times, correlating the strategy's fortunes with the equity market. When bad times do arrive, even though plummeting performance revives the strategy's ex ante attractiveness, speculative capital gets removed from the losing strategy. If the regularity that caused the strategy to be profitable in the first place reflects a (time-varying) risk premium, the new equilibrium should involve a sustainably positive Sharpe ratio, albeit lower than before the regularity was widely known. If the regularity reflects market inefficiency, the Sharpe ratio should converge toward zero once markets have learned about it.

Figure 20.2. Stylized lifecycle of a regularity's ex ante Sharpe ratio.

As discussed in the context of FX carry, this evolution can be characterized as alpha morphing into beta—and not just into any beta but into a bad, insidious variety. The strategy's riskiness is not easily recognized in good times, and losses tend to materialize in bad times.

Strategies with inherently asymmetric payoffs are especially dangerous. Because rare disasters happen rarely, benign conditions can last longer, and more and more investors get sucked into the strategies. FX carry, index volatility selling, front-end credit trading, and harvesting illiquidity premia are examples where the time span between disasters could be a decade or more. Worse, the losses do not materialize at random points in time but in environments like 1998 and 2008 when they are least welcome. Market dynamics are different in those rare occasions: for example, losses become more synchronous when funding conditions become binding and levered traders unwind previously successful positions.

Other profitable strategies do not inherently have negative-skew or positive-beta characteristics but may acquire them largely because their past success—if persistent enough—makes them popular, crowded among leveraged traders, and more likely to fail sharply during financial crises.

Another real-world example: Khandani-Lo (2007) and Pedersen (2009) discuss the quant strategy meltdown in August 2007, when fundamentally and historically uncorrelated equity long-short strategies began temporarily to move in lock step. The combination of common positions and deterioration in liquidity conditions triggered a joint rush for the exit, leading to unprecedented losses over a few days. A particular feedback loop is that liquidations made mispricings worse in popular relative value positions, causing losses to widen and spreading to systematic strategies in other asset classes.

The lesson was that common holdings among hedge funds give rise to a new type of risk which is purely "technical" (in the sense of reflecting the supply and demand for assets, rather than their fundamental values) and which we might call crowded trade risk ("we have found a new risk factor—it is us"). The risk is that when a popular strategy becomes unpopular, would-be sellers will demand liquidity but there is no one buying. That these dangers were not specific to quant investing became abundantly clear during the following year. Arguably, any historically successful strategy has a tendency to become popular among speculative traders. The holdings of leveraged traders and intermediaries are especially important because they may be forced to unwind their positions.

# 20.3 AGENDA FOR MARKET-TIMERS AND RESEARCHERS

Endogeneity contributes to momentum and value effects (see Chapters 14 and 12), and maybe also to carry and liquidity premia (Chapters 13 and 18). Here is one angle. Financial folklore is filled with wise but conflicting clichés, such as "The trend is your friend" and "Avoid the crowds". Both contain a seed of truth but cannot be right in every context. Likewise, the empirical lesson that "hanging on to losers" is a common, costly investment error is hard to reconcile with evidence that "return chasing" or "excessive firing and hiring of managers" hurts long-run performance. Different time horizons can help resolve these apparent contradictions (though other distinguishing contexts may also be relevant). Selling winners and keeping losers over a multi-month horizon hurts if returns exhibit short-term momentum. The opposite action—return chasing—hurts when done over a multi-year horizon if long-term reversals exist, and generally they do. Indeed, Figure 20.1 suggests that market participants' collective actions create a short-term momentum bias and a mild long-term reversal bias [2].

These patterns encourage "market timing" any return source by exploiting short-term momentum (joining the bandwagon) or by resisting market excesses (contrarian positioning). Yet, easy opportunities exist only with hindsight. In real-world risk taking, contrarian trading will lose money if no reversal occurs (outsized returns reflect true structural change or a sustained risk premium) or if the reversal positions are entered too early.

Investment practitioners have rightly become wary of consensus trades and deleveraging risks. They have learned to monitor, on one hand, excessive crowding and stretched market valuations to identify future trouble spots, and, on the other hand, any signs that could trigger liquidations—tightening financial conditions or heightened market turbulence and risk aversion.

The topic of endogeneity provides a fertile field for research. It has broadened from its behavioral origins, in researching bubbles and positive-feedback trading (Shiller, Summers, Shleifer, and others), to rational analyses that have proved useful in explaining the 2007-2008 credit and liquidity crunch. Markus Brunnermeier, Lasse Pedersen, Hyun Song Shin, John Geanakoplos, and others have led the academic work, forming a new school of thought sometimes called the liquidity movement. In addition, policymakers are keen to develop macro-prudential regulation and economic policies that counter various feedback loops and related procyclicality.

Andrew Lo's adaptive markets hypothesis (see Section 5.3) spearheads one interesting strand of this literature. It is not a single well-developed model but a collection of insights based on evolutionary principles. Competition should drive alpha toward zero but not in a linear fashion. The degree of market efficiency and the attractiveness of trading strategies can wax and wane depending on the environment. Relative populations in market ecology will evolve over time: there will be more momentum traders after contrarian value strategies fail, louder and better respected market bears after a large selloff, etc. The ability to adapt to changing environments through innovation and flexibility is the key to investment success, just as it is to evolutionary success.

Stein (2009) addresses an interesting question in the same spirit: "Do smarter investors make markets more efficient?" He notes that typical market participants have likely become more sophisticated over time (more professional investment, more quantitative analysis, more leveraged players). This tendency should make any simple regularities less profitable. However, data mining, especially quant investors' repeated use of the same empirical history and similar models and ideas to develop strategies, gives rise to new problems, such as overcrowding, and subsequent liquidations at fire sale prices. Thus, it is not clear whether financial markets have really become more efficient.

# 20.4 NOTES

[1] The reversal measure seems arbitrary (contrasting the most recent 6-month vs. 18-to-24-month-ago returns). Results are broadly similar for any past 6-month window beyond the first year; during the first year, the momentum effect still dominates. The reversal indicator I use is not really multi-year, but with a 20-year data window I have too few independent observations to study truly long-horizon reversals. Looking at longer histories, 3-to-5-year stock returns appear to be negatively autocorrelated in both the 19th and 20th centuries, but the same is not true for real bond returns. In any case, such mean reversion evidence is relatively weak and plagued with econometric problems. Mean-reverting deviations from some fundamental value anchor often give better trading signals than simple past returns. Finally, relative mean reversion across assets may well be stronger than absolute mean reversion if general risk appetite exhibits multi-year trends.

[2] The disposition effect (tendency of individuals to sell winners rather than losers from the existing portfolio) can cause momentum through underreaction effects (resistant flows delay information dissemination into market prices). Moreover, the success of any asset or strategy tends to attract net inflows, which generate short-term momentum. The widespread selling of an asset class after a couple of years of underperformance may create temporary undervaluation and give rise to later reversal.

# Forward-looking measures of asset returns

- Value and carry indicators can be useful predictors of future asset returns, especially over longer horizons, even if we do not know the underlying reason for the generic cheapness.
- Popular indicators include earnings yields and dividend yields for equities, real yields and yield curve steepness for Treasuries, and various credit spreads for non-government bonds.
- Prospective real long-term returns can be compared across asset classes (apples with apples).
- In a building block approach, each asset's or strategy's prospective return is expressed as a sum of carry, expected cash flow growth, and expected valuation change. This framework could be useful for assessing the prospects of several asset classes in a consistent manner.

Forward-looking return signals are surprisingly good indicators of long-term return outlook. Here, I review popular value and carry measures for major asset classes. They have their shortcomings but these are partly compensated by their simplicity and real-time observability. More complex value indicators exist but involve more specific assumptions (model specification risk), more elaborate statistical estimation (estimation risk), and often more hindsight bias. Carry and value indicators can usefully (if noisily) predict future returns even when we don't understand the reason for the risk premium and even when we don't know whether the source of predictability is a rational risk premium or irrational mispricing. This generic nature of carry and value indicators is a clear advantage, given our inherently limited understanding of the ultimate drivers of expected asset returns.

If expected returns vary over time, how can we know the current level of expected returns? In most cases we cannot. Sadly, the market's expected returns are unobservable. The best we can do is estimate them, by hook or crook. The simplest and more popular approaches involve relating current market prices to some value anchors. If current market prices are low compared with such anchors (which can be as simple as historical average price, yield or spread, or something more complex), expected returns are deemed to be above average. Such value indicators do not reveal whether high current expected returns reflect irrational underpricing or rationally high risk premia. Moreover, these value indicators can be poor short-term predictors. They may fail even over longer horizons if structural change shifts the long-run mean.

Carry indicators are often related to value indicators but details differ. Carry captures an asset's income return over time. Besides cash income, broader carry measures include other returns earned under conditions of stable or unchanged markets (e.g., if the term structure of interest rates or of commodity futures prices stays unchanged). If the yield curve is upward sloping and remains unchanged, bonds earn capital gains simply by aging and rolling down the yield curve. Similarly, if, say, a backwardated crude oil futures price curve remains unchanged over a quarter, a futures contract earns roll gains as its maturity shrinks and it rolls up the futures price curve.

Value and carry, discussed in this chapter, are objective, ex ante return indicators based on market prices. Chapter 23, in contrast, tackles survey-based (subjective) measures of ex ante returns. Chapter 24 reviews tactical approaches to predicting returns based on multiple indicators, in contrast to the slow-moving strategic signals provided by the value and carry approaches treated in the current chapter.

# 21.1 POPULAR VALUE AND CARRY INDICATORS AND THEIR PITFALLS

# Equities

For equities, the earnings yield or earnings per share (E/P)—the inverse of the price/earnings (P/E) ratio—is the most popular value indicator, especially since the growing popularity of share buybacks reduced dividend yield's information content. Under rather restrictive assumptions, a stock's earnings yield equals its expected real return. Experts debate which earnings measure and which time window or horizon to use. Firms and sell-side analysts tend to focus on "operating earnings" that ignore non-recurring items, such as writeoffs, which may distort the general picture of earnings trends. Such data have been available since the 1980s. However, since non-recurring items typically are negative, operating earnings are regularly higher than reported earnings. Advocates of using reported instead of operating earnings point out that, while any particular writeoff is non-recurring, writeoffs are the way that companies report the results of business decisions that did not work out. Such decisions are commonplace, so a certain level of writeoff activity should be expected, on average, each year in the future.

Moreover, the operating earnings number that is usually cited by sell-side analysts is the forward-looking consensus analyst estimate of next year earnings, rather than trailing earnings. Forward earnings are invariably higher than trailing earnings, partly reflecting the normal uptrend in earnings, and partly analyst overoptimism that is related to their incentives. Reported earnings have made a comeback after the equity bubble years; other alternatives have been developed but none has a history as long as that available for reported earnings yields. If one is going to use trailing earnings, how many years' trailing earnings should be used? One-year trailing earnings are common but can exhibit cyclical fluctuations that are too strong (e.g., giving rise to the high P/E ratios in the 1932, 2002, and 2009 bear markets). For this reason, smoother long-term earnings—up to a 10-year window—may be preferred.

Note that  $\mathrm{E} / \mathrm{P}$  is an absolute value indicator—it relates a firm's current  $\mathrm{E} / \mathrm{P}$  level to its own history.  $\mathrm{E} / \mathrm{P}$  and other value measures can also be compared across individual equities or equity market sectors and countries, thus making them relative value indicators.

Equity risk premium measures based on the dividend discount model (DDM) directly incorporate some estimate of future cash flow growth. However, the DDM is an accounting identity and not a fully developed model. Under the assumption that current market valuations will not change over time, the expected return on an equity investment reflects just dividend income plus the expected growth rate of dividends, where dividend growth is achieved through retention of earnings (i.e., reinvestment into the company of that part of earnings not paid out as dividends). (Analysts may substitute, in place of dividends, a broader measure of cash flow to the investor.) The DDM can be expressed in either nominal or real terms; the real version says that expected real equity return equals dividend yield plus expected real dividend growth. The equity premium over bonds is thus the difference between expected real equity return and real Treasury yield [1].

The classic carry proxy, dividend yield (D/P), has become too narrow a measure of carry because firms increasingly use means other than dividends to distribute cash to investors, including share repurchases and cash acquisitions. In particular, share repurchases have substituted dividend payments. I discussed broader payout yields in Section 8.4.

# Government bonds

Yield to maturity (YTM) is a bond's internal rate of return and the traditional value measure in fixed income markets. YTM measures an asset's expected return over its lifetime if it is held to maturity and if cash flows can be reinvested at the same YTM rate. (Whenever yield curves are not exactly flat, it follows that different reinvestment rates are inconsistently assumed for different bonds.) Over short horizons, YTM equals expected return if a bond can be sold exactly at the yield at which it was bought. These assumptions are of course highly restrictive but, for straight (non-optionable) bonds, YTM can be a decent proxy for expected return. YTM clearly captures the yield income (carry) component, and the yield spread between two bonds may also predict capital gains if the spread is mean-reverting.

Bond yields reflect the market's rate expectations and the required bond risk premium (BRP). If we have an observable proxy of the market's rate expectations, we can isolate the two components of the yield curve and thus get a cleaner BRP proxy. Some analysts use term structure models or econometric analyses to isolate the two components but I prefer to use survey data. The survey-based BRP is simply the difference between 10-year Treasury yield and the consensus forecast of average short-term Treasury bill rates over the next decade.

Expected real bond yield is another useful value indicator (and more easily available); it is the difference between bond yield and some deflator. Real yields may use as deflators either the trailing inflation rate, a market-based inflation estimate, survey-based expected inflation, or some econometric estimate of expected inflation. I prefer to use maturity-matched consensus forecasts of long-term inflation, which have been available since the late 1970s (statistical estimates of expected inflation can be used before this). The introduction of inflation-linked bond markets (in 1981 in the U.K. and in 1997 in the U.S.) gave us a market-based alternative for assessing real yields; however, linker yield clearly differs from the expected real yield of nominal bonds due to time-varying inflation and liquidity premia.

# Non-government bonds

YTM is the constant discount rate which, when applied to expected cash flows, produces the prices of the bond. Raw YTM spreads involve some unreasonable assumptions and maturity mismatches. In the olden days, YTW or yield to worst (i.e., "worst call" or call date least favorable to the investor) was an improvement over raw YTM, which simply ignored embedded options in, say, callable corporate bonds. To incorporate the value of embedded options, YTW computed the bond's yield to maturity and to various potential call dates, and then used the lowest of the resulting yields. The option-adjusted spread (OAS) was developed in the 1980s as a more consistent measure of a bond's probability-weighted yield spread or advantage over a reference curve (often Treasuries or interest rate swaps).

The OAS was originally developed for bonds with embedded options but it is also used for "bullet" bonds with known cash flows. For such bonds, the OAS is the size of parallel shift in the reference curve needed to make the bond's present value using the adjusted curve to match the bond's market price. The OAS takes all bond cash flows into account so that a corporate bond is effectively duration-matched to reference curve assets. For bonds with uncertain cash flows, the OAS is calculated using some term structure model and some volatility assumption. OAS estimates can differ widely across data providers, depending on model specification and on the assumed level of interest rate volatility. The OAS is closely related to credit default swap (CDS) spreads (when both use swaps as the reference curve), but exact calculations differ. Only the CDS spread incorporates non-zero recovery values, which are important for high-yield debt.

So does the OAS or the yield spread between a higher yielding bond and a lower yielding Treasury properly capture the expected return advantage of the former? The OAS incorporates the fact that the investor has effectively written an option (or many) to the issuer/borrower. A simple yield spread misses this optionality and thereby overstates the expected return advantage. But both measures are overstated because the yield spread also reflects expected losses due to defaults or downgradings (see Chapter 10).

Carry and financing rates. If the corporate bond and government bond had the same financing costs, the OAS or yield spread would not only measure the value but also the carry of the long-corporate, short-Treasury position. However, these financing costs do differ. As a good approximation, corporates can be financed at deposit rates (such as LIBOR) while government bonds can be financed at repo rates, which are lower: either the general collateral (GC) rate or the even lower special repo rate. Thus, a proper carry measure for levered credit investors also includes a financing spread; carry is positive only if the asset's credit spread (corporate minus Treasury) exceeds the financing spread (LIBOR minus GC). An unlevered investor simply considering where to allocate his capital may ignore the financing rate difference; for such an institution, yield spread also measures carry advantage. More generally, financing costs vary not only across assets but also across investors for the same asset: margins or haircuts may be larger and bid-ask spreads wider for lower rated investors and for smaller customers.

For money market spreads, a particular pitfall is that quotation conventions vary across assets, typically for historical reasons. For example, compounding frequencies or day-count practices can differ, and some assets (Treasury bills and commercial paper) are quoted as discount rates whereas others (deposits and CDs) are quoted as money market rates. Any meaningful analysis starts by making different quotations comparable.

Figures 21.1 and 21.2 give a flavor of forward-looking expected return measures in several asset classes. The first graph shows reasonably comparable measures (ex ante real yields) while the second graph shows more typical but less comparable ex ante indicators for equities and bonds. Also see Figure 2.7 for a century-long history.

# 21.2 BUILDING BLOCKS OF EXPECTED RETURNS

The toolkits investors use to assess future return prospects often differ across asset classes, reflecting dissimilarities between asset types as well as investor specialization. This book emphasizes the similarities between these toolkits (e.g., by highlighting parallel value and carry indicators in different contexts). Still, subtle or less subtle differences in indicators can lead to misleading comparisons across asset classes. In this section, I sketch a building block approach that can give a consistent framework for evaluating multiple investment types.

Recall the building blocks for prospective equity market returns in Figure 8.3: Yield income (carry) + Expected cash flow growth (inflation plus real growth) + Expected valuation change. A similar analysis using building blocks may be useful for assessing the long-term returns of all asset classes and strategy styles. Carry and value indicators have key roles in such a building block analysis:

- Carry captures the first building block. It can refer to income or, more broadly, to return in an unchanged capital market scenario, including some rolldown effects and fee or cost effects. (Roll effects are discussed in Sections 9.2, 11.3, and 22.2.)
- Value indicators are key for determining the third building block if we expect any reversal tendency toward a value anchor. Valuation changes are important in accounting for realized returns, but the impact on return predictions is often modest because mean reversion tendencies can be weak. It is often sensible to assume unchanged valuations even if valuations differ somewhat from their long-run averages (this makes the third term zero, by assumption). It is more reasonable to assume some mean reversion if prevailing valuations are exceptionally high or low. Even then, other evidence may point to structural changes in valuation ratios, such as the recent persistent upward shift in the relative valuations of emerging markets vs. developed markets.
- Expected nominal cash flow growth is the second building block. Stocks also benefit from expected cash flow growth, although the growth rate that one can reasonably expect is more modest than many investors believe. Similarly, real estate benefits from rent growth. In contrast, Treasuries have fixed cash flows, and credit-risky bonds can expect some default losses. One can debate where to classify fees, trading style costs, trading profits or losses of hedge funds, and trend-following strategies; my choices are shown in Table 21.1.

The boundaries between building blocks can be fuzzy. Note that expected inflation is captured in the first building block for bonds (as well as for commodity futures and hedge funds), but in the second block for stocks and real estate.

* For consistency, the growth term and the valuation change term for stocks should reflect growth or change in the same payout flows to investors that we use in the income term. Mixing dividend yields or broader payout yields with expectations of EPS growth and changing P/E ratio, as I do in this table, is only justified if we assume a constant earnings retention ratio.

legs. For comparability with the first four rows, these rates would have to be added back when adding them to total expected returns.

Value and carry indicators are reviewed above for stocks and bonds. Value and carry indicators for real estate, commodities, and currencies are discussed in Sections 11.2, 11.3, and 13.3. Value is typically based on deviation of current market price from some valuation anchor (such as purchasing power parity for currencies or rental income for real estate). In the absence of better value anchors, investors may use average real market price over the past few years to capture any mean reversion tendency.

Natural value indicators exist for some systematic strategies (e.g., the dispersion of valuation ratios between value and growth stocks, or the implied-vs.-realized volatility gap for volatility selling). For FX carry, the combination of carry dispersion and expected spot rate changes from value dispersion across currencies capture ex ante opportunity. Useful measures of ex ante opportunity also exist for certain hedge fund strategies, such as merger arbitrage or convertible arbitrage. However, for trend following and for general hedge fund investing there are no obvious value anchors.

The relative importance of the three components varies across investments, often by construction. For example, the currency carry strategy earns nearly all of its long-run profits by being systematically long carry (buying high-yield currencies against selling low-yield currencies). In contrast, the commodity momentum strategy has ambiguous and incidental carry because recent winners can just as well have higher or lower carry than recent losers. Most of this strategy's profits come from the tendency of recent multimonth performance to persist. I classify the associated trading profits as cash flow growth. Given the limited guidance from carry or value indicators, it is hard to assess the prospective return of the commodity momentum strategy beyond assuming that "future equals past" for its long-run track record.

The advantage of Table 21.1 is that it enables apples-to-apples comparisons between asset classes and strategies, thereby giving a useful framework for multi-asset-class investors. The sum of the three components is total nominal return (when cash income is added to long-short strategy returns). If real or excess returns are studied, inflation rates or financing costs should be subtracted in a consistent way from all investments.

Admittedly, many inputs require significant judgment and can be debated even if we agree on the building block framework. Moreover, the exhibit is very coarse. I will not fill the table with numbers because they can differ widely within each group. Stocks include markets as diverse as those of the U.S., Japan, and emerging countries. Government securities include nominal and inflation-linked bonds and these are issued by countries with varying credit qualities and currency situations. The spectrum of exposures to credit is so wide that it cannot be briefly described. Real estate includes (at the time of writing) hot China, cold Florida, and dull Germany. Commodity futures include materials as different as oil, gold, and corn. Hedge funds include equity market neutral, global macro, fixed income arbitrage, and just about every other strategy that has ever been devised.

The proposed approach is simpler and more arbitrary than the econometric multifactor model discussed in Section 16.1, which also offers a consistent tool for multi-asset-class investors. In practice, different types and frequencies of data as well as different return drivers across asset classes may make this building block approach a more practical tool. Moreover, one could conceivably use econometric tools to forecast the different components of investment returns—such as their mean reversion tendencies—and do this consistently across asset classes or strategies.

The ideas developed in this section are obviously work in progress. Readers can feel free to take them further.

# 21.3 NOTES

[1] The DDM assumes a constant discount rate and a constant dividend (or other cash flow) growth rate. It is pretty straightforward to modify the constant growth rate assumption so as to move from a single-stage DDM to a multi-stage DDM (e.g., one can use analyst forecasts in the early years and then assume a gradual decay towards some "normal" long-run growth rate). It is harder to modify the assumption of a constant discount rate but Campbell-Shiller (1988) develop an approximate (linearized) dynamic DDM that allows time-varying expected returns.

# Interpreting carry or non-zero yield spreads

- Non-zero yield spreads can reflect the market's expectations about future rate changes or growth, or they can reflect higher yielding assets' prospective return advantage. In all asset markets we can identify interpretations analogous to these two. The two alternative interpretations can be called risk-neutral hypotheses and risk premium hypotheses.
- The uncovered interest parity hypothesis for currencies, the pure expectations hypothesis for interest rates, and analogous risk-neutral investor hypotheses for other asset classes presume that all assets have the same expected returns as the riskless asset. For consistency, market expectations must then imply price movements that cause capital losses just sufficient to offset any initial yield advantage.
- Risk premium hypotheses make the polar opposite claim: yield spreads only reveal required return differentials and reveal nothing about market expectations on future rates.
- Empirical "horse races" show that yield spreads have been better predictors of future returns than of "offsetting" market rate or growth changes. Over long histories, yield-seeking (positive-carry) strategies have been profitable in all asset classes studied. Such evidence contradicts risk-neutral hypotheses and supports risk premium hypotheses. (Even if carry losses are rare, their size and timing can justify large risk premia.)
- However, empirical evidence does not speak to the rationality of high prospective returns when carry is high. Survey evidence suggests that biased (irrational) expectations, in addition to or instead of rational risk premia, may have contributed to the historical success of yield-seeking strategies.

# 22.1 INTRODUCTION

This section discusses two opposite interpretations of why prospective yields differ across assets and presents empirical evidence to help assess which interpretation is more consistent with reality. Interestingly, this same question is raised in virtually all asset classes. Here are a few examples:

- If you see higher short-term nominal interest rates, say, in the U.S. than in Japan, does the U.S. yield advantage tell us that the market expects the dollar to depreciate against the yen or does it say that global investors require a higher near-term return for U.S. deposits than for unhedged Japanese deposits?
- If you see an upward-sloping yield curve, does it mean that the market expects rising yields in the future or that investors require higher returns for holding longer term bonds?
- If you see higher earnings yields (i.e., lower P/E ratios) for finance stocks than for energy stocks, does this yield difference indicate that the market expects slower future earnings growth (and thus more gradual capital gains) for finance stocks, or does it mean that investors currently require higher returns for finance stocks than for energy stocks because finance stocks are riskier?
- If you see a steeply backwardated (i.e., downward sloping) term structure of crude oil futures prices, is it a sign that the market expects oil prices to fall in the near term (maybe reflecting expectations of mean reversion after a sharp runup) or does it mean that investors require a high-return premium for owning the oil futures (earned if the futures price rolls up toward the higher spot price)?

Do you see the symmetry? In each case, the first interpretation says that yield spreads represent the market's expectation of future rate or price changes just sufficient to cause capital losses that exactly offset any initial carry advantage. It is thus assumed that all assets, regardless of their risk, have the same ex ante return, that of the riskless asset. The second interpretation says WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), at least on average: a positive yield spread represents a required ex ante risk premium that tends to be subsequently realized, on average.

The above interpretations are alternatives within the rational paradigm: one extreme is associated with risk-neutral investors (all assets have the same expected return), the other with risk-averse investors and time-varying risk premia. The empirical analysis discussed below can distinguish whether wide yield spreads tend to predict "offsetting" future changes in rates (or prices) or, instead, high near-term returns, but they leave the question of rationality open.

# 22.2 FUTURE EXCESS RETURNS OR MARKET EXPECTATIONS?

To gain algebraic intuition to the information in yield spreads (forward rates), it is useful to decompose the realized return on any investment into two parts:

$$
\text {T o t a l} \approx \text {C a r r y} + \text {C a p i t a l} (\text {l o s s e s}) \tag {22.1}
$$ where "carry" refers to income return (more broadly: return in an unchanged capital market scenario) and capital gains refer to percentage price changes due to changing capital market conditions. Loosely speaking, the two components reflect expected and unexpected returns. (However, for equities, it is important to recall that expected returns also include prospective capital gains related to cash flow growth; see Table 21.1.)


For currencies, carry reflects the short-rate differential while capital gains reflect spot exchange rate changes. For government bonds, carry is yield income while capital gains are well proxied by duration times yield decline. For equities, carry reflects dividend yield while capital gains reflect stock price changes. For commodity futures, carry reflects the so-called roll effect (as well as the riskless rate on the futures margin).

$FX$  example. Any pair of assets earns the same total realized returns (over some holding period) only if one asset's initial carry advantage is exactly offset by capital losses caused by subsequent rate/price moves. This is a logical statement and an accounting identity—not a hypothesis. Starting with a currency example, if one-year U.S. deposits offer an interest rate  $3\%$  higher than that offered by Japanese deposits, the dollar-yen exchange rate must depreciate by  $3\%$  over the next year to make both deposits earn the same return (and their long-short position to break even). Forward exchange rates are break-even future exchange rates; in this example the one-year forward rate is  $3\%$  weaker than the spot dollar-yen rate.


The break-even concept is useful for investors but may be abused—when forward break-even rates are uncritically treated as the market's rate expectations. The problem is apparent when we solve (22.1) for carry, and restate the equation in expectational form: carry reflects expected near-term asset returns (including required risk premia) as well as expected capital losses due to the market's rate expectations:

$$

\text {C a r r y} \approx E (\text {t o t a l r e t u r n}) - E (\text {c a p i t a l g a i n s / l o s s e s f r o m r a t e c h a n g e s}) \tag {22.2}

$$

For the currency example, let us study the relation between log spot and forward exchange rates  $S$  and  $F$ . (Certain mathematical and statistical analyses are easier when we use log exchange rates. We can deal with additive relations rather than ratios and multiplicative relations. The same is true for expressing bond yields as continuously compounded or log rates.) Covered interest arbitrage ensures that the forward premium  $F - S$  is proportional to the cross-country deposit rate differential (carry). However, it does not follow that the break-even forward rate equals the market expected future spot rate. The latter statement is only a hypothesis—uncovered interest parity (UIP)—which is valid in a risk-neutral world where expected returns on deposits are equal in all countries. (I ignore here a small nonlinear effect called Siegel's paradox or Jensen's inequality.)

Macroeconomists embraced the UIP hypothesis for decades, despite contradictory empirical evidence that high-yielding currencies tend to outperform low-yielding currencies. These UIP violations were dubbed the forward premium puzzle (see Chapter 13). Another classic finding, that spot exchange rates behave empirically like a random walk, actually supports a carry-oriented alternative hypothesis to UIP. If spot exchange rate changes are unpredictable (so that the best forecast of the future spot rate is the current one), then any initial yield advantage will be retained, on average, and will not tend to be offset by future depreciation.

Conceptually, we can add and subtract the unobservable market expectation of the future spot rate,  $E(S)$ , to and from the currency carry measure  $(F - S)$ . Equation (22.3) then shows that, as in (22.2), carry reflects two components: expected excess return  $[F - E(S)]$  and expected future change in the spot rate  $[E(\Delta S)]$ :

$$

F - S \approx [ F - E (S) ] + [ E (S) - S ] \tag {22.3}

$$

In Section 22.3, I review the literature and run empirical tests ("horse races") to see whether positive carry predicts high future excess returns (as the random walk hypothesis implies) or large future spot rate changes (as the UIP hypothesis implies).

IR example. For government bonds (and interest rate swaps), the implied forward curve next year shows how much the yield curve has to shift to make all bonds earn the same return as a one-year bond (presumably deemed riskless by an investor with a one-year time horizon). Thus, if such a curve is realized in a year's time, all bond positions financed at the one-year rate will exactly break even. If the yield curve is upward sloping, longer bonds have an initial yield advantage over the riskless bond, which gives them some cushion against capital losses caused by rising yields. Forward yield quantifies the size of this break-even cushion. If actual bond yields one year hence turn out to be higher than those implied by today's forward rates, then longer bonds will underperform the one-year bond.


Here, too, we often hear observers say that "the market expects rising rates" when forwards imply rising rates. I repeat: break-even forward curves represent the market's rate expectations only if risk premia are zero. The pure expectations hypothesis (PEH) is a close cousin of the UIP hypothesis. It presumes that investors are risk neutral, with the result that all bonds have the same near-term expected return, regardless of their maturity. In the assumed absence of risk premia, yield differentials across the curve only reflect market expectations of future yield changes (so that expected capital gains or losses exactly offset the impact of initial yield differences) [1]. However, it is a mistake to assume the absence of risk premia.

Equation (22.4) shows an approximate accounting identity that decomposes curve steepness into rate change expectation and risk premium components (cf. equation 9.7), analogous to the components in the two previous equations:

Curve steepness  $\approx$  Required bond risk premium

$$
+ \text {E x p e c t e d} \tag {22.4}
$$

An identity is not a theory. The ex post counterpart of the ex ante statement in (22.4) is a tautology. It simply says that if the yield curve is upward sloping, either bond yields rise enough to cause capital losses that offset their positive carry or longer bonds earn higher realized returns than short bonds. If it is not one (with future rate changes "offsetting" yield advantage), it must be the other (realized return advantage). The economic content of the identity in (22.4) comes from assuming that investor expectations are rational and consistent: given an upward-sloping yield curve, investors in the aggregate either expect rising yields to offset positive carry or they expect (and presumably require) a return advantage for longer bonds.

In reality, forward rates (curve steepness) likely contain a mixture of two components—the market's expectations of rate changes and required risk premia. Yet, studying the extremes—the PEH and the risk premium (or random walk) hypothesis—is informative because each argues that only one component matters (see Table 22.1), enabling us to focus on that component and understand it more deeply.

# Detour into roll

The distinction between carry as running yield income and capital gains as price changes in (22.1) is muddled whenever price changes are highly predictable. One obvious example is a short-term Treasury bill that is issued at a discount; the bill earns its fully predictable return through price appreciation, accruing toward par. Similarly, any discount or premium coupon bond earns part of its return (the part in addition to coupon income) via the "pull-to-par" effect as the bond ages. A bond's yield to maturity captures this feature despite its other shortcomings. Thus for bonds it is often reasonable to use yield to maturity for carry and "duration times yield decline" for capital gains.

Table 22.1. The implications of two hypotheses about yield curve behavior

<table><tr><td></td><td>Pure expectations hypothesis</td><td>Risk premium hypothesis</td></tr><tr><td>What is the information in forward rates (yield curve steepness)?</td><td>Market&#x27;s rate expectations</td><td>Required bond risk premia</td></tr><tr><td>What future events should forward rates forecast?</td><td>Future interest rate changes</td><td>Near-term return differentials across bonds</td></tr><tr><td>What is the best predictor of a 5-year zero-coupon bond&#x27;s 1-year return?</td><td>The 1-year riskless spot rate</td><td>The 5-year zero&#x27;s “rolling yield” (which is also the 1-year forward rate after 4 years)</td></tr><tr><td>What is the best predictor of next year&#x27;s spot yield curve?</td><td>Implied spot yield curve one year forward</td><td>Current spot yield curve</td></tr></table>

There are obviously more sophisticated ways to analyze any asset but these back-of-the-envelope calculations are useful shortcuts.

Roll or slide is another nuanced aspect of carry. The random walk hypothesis assumes that the current yield curve is the best predictor of the future yield curve. If an upward-sloping yield curve remains unchanged over the next year, a long-term bond's yield income advantage over the one-year bond will be augmented by capital gains through a "rolldown" effect. For example, if the current 4-year rate is 20 bp lower than the current 5-year rate, the assumption of an unexpected yield curve implies that the bond's yield will fall by 20 bp simply as a result of aging and rolling down the yield curve. The consequent "rolldown return" gives roughly a  $0.8\%$  capital gain (a 4-year duration times a 20 bp yield decline) even if the constant maturity yield curve is unchanged. We can calculate a broader carry measure that incorporates both yield income and rolldown return; it is called "rolling yield" and reflects return in an unchanged curve scenario. (All I have done here is to describe mechanically how expected returns are realized in a random walk world, but the empirical analyses in Section 22.3 will show that a random walk is not a bad base assumption.)

Rolling yield indicates the return of a government bond in an unchanged capital markets environment, specifically one in which the yield curve is unchanged. There are other examples where an asset's own characteristics change over time in an unchanged capital markets environment, resulting in yield or price changes merely due to the passage of time:

- Credit spread curves are often mildly upward sloping. Under such conditions, a corporate bond can outperform the government bond beyond its yield spread by "rolling down the spread curve". This feature boosts the corporate bond's expected return in excess of the duration-matched Treasury; in addition, both bonds can benefit from the "rolling down the yield curve" effect if the Treasury curve is upward sloping.
- When the term structure of commodity futures prices is in backwardation (downward sloping), commodity futures tend to "roll up the curve" as they approach expiration. (Note that both rolling down the yield curve and rolling up the price curve imply rolldown price gains.)

- Options losing their time value have a similar characteristic: prices change simply due to the passage of time. This time decay makes long option positions "a wasting asset". Short option positions make money if markets are stable and lose money in large market moves.

Let us go back to equation (22.1) and approximate the "Carry + Capital gains" expression with "Expected return + Unexpected return". Rolling yield is a broad measure of carry that includes expected return from highly predictable price changes. Under the risk premium hypothesis, unexpected returns reflect capital gains or losses from unexpected rate changes. To break even, any position with a positive expected return must suffer exactly offsetting unexpected capital losses (same size, opposite sign) during the evaluation period. If subsequent market moves tend to be smaller than the breakeven analysis implies, positive-carry strategies add value in the long run. This question can only be addressed empirically, and I turn to it next.

# 22.3 EMPIRICAL HORSE RACES FOR VARIOUS ASSETS

Do forwards reflect the market's rate expectations, required risk premia, or both? Are forward rates or current spot rates better forecasts of future spot rates? Are expected returns equal across assets or do yield spreads predict near-term differences in returns? I now evaluate these questions empirically. The UIP and the PEH are mere hypotheses, and pretty extreme at that, with the truth almost certainly between these extremes, on the one hand, and the opposite extreme risk premium hypotheses, on the other hand. The evidence I present below contradicts the extreme assumption of equal expected returns across assets. I stress how analogous questions can be evaluated in virtually all asset markets, with some modifications.

Where possible, I use so-called complementary regressions that effectively split the predictive ability in ex ante yield differentials (forward-spot premia) into future rate or price changes and near-term return differentials (see Fama-Bliss, 1987). I regress future realized asset price or rate changes on the changes implied by forward rates and I regress future excess asset returns on forward-spot premia. In these "complementary regressions" the regression slopes must sum to one.

# Currencies

I discussed UIP and its violations in Section 22.2, while Chapter 13 focused on the long-run success of the FX carry strategy, so I will be brief here. Table 22.2 shows the slope coefficients of complementary regressions for several dollar pairs, using monthly data over 32 years. As numerous studies since the 1980s have shown, when future exchange rate changes are regressed on forward-implied changes, slope coefficients tend to be negative, thereby contradicting the UIP (which predicts a slope of 1 in the first column). The "wrong" (negative) sign implies that, on average, the carry advantage of a higher yielding currency has been augmented by subsequent currency appreciation instead of being offset by subsequent depreciation. It follows that slope coefficients in the second regression type—future excess returns on yield differentials—exceed one.

The complementary regressions presume that the split between the yield spread's ability to forecast future rate changes and its ability to predict near-term returns is

constant. Unpublished subperiod analysis suggests some time variation although this might reflect sampling variability. Rolling 10-year slope coefficients when regressing excess currency returns on carry do consistently exceed zero and even one, suggesting that the assumption of the risk premium hypothesis (or random walk hypothesis, slope  $= 1$ ) has been quite conservative. Empirically, the horse race is not really between the UIP and random walk hypotheses (slopes 0 and 1) but between the latter hypothesis and some more aggressive pro-carry story; the UIP is rejected.

# Interest rates

I now turn to complementary regressions in the Treasury market using monthly data over 1972-2009. The PEH implies slope coefficients of 1 and 0 in the two regressions while the risk premium hypothesis implies coefficients 0 and 1. Leibowitz-Bader-Kogelman (1995) label the slope coefficient on the regression of excess return on carry as the persistence factor (PF). The idea is that if the current yield curve has a strong tendency to persist (remain unchanged), carry tends to be earned, and  $\mathrm{PF} = 1$ . If, instead, the current yield curve gives way to the forward curve, there are no predictable excess returns, and  $\mathrm{PF} = 0$ .

The results in Table 22.3 are almost as devastating for the PEH as they were for the UIP in the currency markets. Yield change regressions have the "wrong" sign—a pattern Frederick Macaulay noted as early as 1938—in that upward-sloping yield curves tend to be followed by subsequent yield declines. Since consequent capital gains augment any rolling yield advantage that long bonds have, the PFs exceed 1. For the 10-year maturity, the PF is  $+2.5$ . The correlation between curve steepness (or, in jargon, the forward-implied yield change) and next quarter change in the 10-year yield is  $-0.13$  while the correlation between curve steepness and next quarter excess bond return is  $+0.21$ . Shorter maturity bonds have lower PFs. Other studies show that long-term

changes in short-dated assets behave more in line with the PEH than short-term changes in long-dated assets.

Again, complementary regressions presume that there is a constant split between the yield curve's ability to forecast future rate changes and its ability to forecast near-term returns. Subperiod analysis suggests some time variation, a tendency of coefficients to decline over time. Coefficients have almost always been positive, fluctuating around  $\mathrm{PF} = 1$ , a finding broadly consistent with the risk premium hypothesis.

In unpublished analysis, I find that the results for German Bunds (government bonds) are comparable with those for U.S. Treasuries. Curve steepness has over time become a less effective predictor of future returns in duration-timing models and curve-trading models. Yet, carry-oriented strategies across G10 bond markets (overweighting currency-hedged bonds in countries with steep curves and underweighting them in countries with inverted or flat yield curves) have achieved good long-run SRs.

# Corporate credits and interest rate swaps

For credit spreads, I ask whether the (option-adjusted) spread reflects expected future default losses and expected spread widening (which, when combined, would exactly offset the initial carry advantage) or, instead, a true expected return advantage for bearing default and liquidity risks. There is again the PEH-like proposition in which risk-neutral investors bid down all assets' expected returns to the same level. According to this story, the credit spread shows how large the combined effects of defaults and spread widening are expected by the market to be, and it tells nothing about future return differentials across assets. The opposite hypothesis is that all of the credit spread reflects default and liquidity premia—an ex ante return advantage that investors should get to hold, on average; this hypothesis cannot be literally true if there are any losses from default.

For reasons I have already suggested, neither of these extreme hypotheses is likely to be true in practice. First, historical average default losses are much lower than historical average yield spreads, suggesting that part of the spread reflects an ex ante premium. Second, there is evidence of time variation in credit premia. The correlation between the Lehman corporate credit index spread and subsequent excess return of credits over Treasuries is  $+0.12$  using monthly data and  $+0.48$  using annual data (both covering 1973-2009). The rolling 10-year correlation has been positive virtually throughout the sample period.

# Equities

Here the two polar hypotheses are that high equity "yields" reflect either market expectations of slower future growth rates or higher required risk premia. Yields and matching growth rates can refer to dividends or a broader measure of cash payouts, but any of these measures, if it is to be useful, ultimately translates to the growth rate of the stock price. In a risk-neutral environment, any asset with an income advantage should have lower expected capital gains (growth) so that total expected returns are equalized across assets.

In a market-timing context, we can evaluate equity market yields as they vary over time. Complementary regressions then ask, for example, whether high dividend yields (i.e., low market valuations) predict a low future dividend growth rate or high future equity returns. As Cochrane (2008a) stresses, the assumptions needed to imply that dividend yields must forecast either of them are quite weak. Since there is little evidence of dividend growth predictability, he concludes that dividend yields must primarily predict future returns. Evidence from the pre-World War II period and from outside the U.S. is more equivocal on the information content of dividend yield, however.

In a cross-sectional context, we can compare dividend yield, earnings yield, or other valuation multiples between individual stocks (or between sectors or countries). The polar hypotheses are whether the yield gap between "value" and "growth" stocks primarily reflects different expected earnings growth rates (and ultimately different price appreciation rates that offset any initial yield advantage) or different required returns. Empirically, it is clear that value stocks tend to earn higher long-run returns. It is also true that growth stocks tend to grow faster than value stocks in the early years—but the growth gap is not as strong or as persistent as the valuation gap implies. Thus the data are more supportive of the value managers' story that cheap stocks outperform in the long run, than with the growth managers' story that the fast future appreciation of growth stocks justifies their high valuations.

# Commodities

The term structure of commodity futures prices can be in backwardation (downward sloping) or in contango (upward sloping). Backwardation, in which the spot price exceeds the futures price,  $S > F$ , implies that the convenience yield for holding the spot commodity exceeds storage and financing costs. Steeply inverted price curves tend to coincide with low inventories, as scarcity temporarily boosts the spot price. Conversely, upward-sloping price curves tend to coincide with high inventories, abundant supply, and a historically low spot price.

In parallel with the twin hypotheses above, the shape of the commodity term structure may reflect expected changes in the spot price or risk premia. Scarcity-induced spikes in the spot price may well be deemed temporary, causing an expectation of price decline. However, if the term structure remains unchanged as time passes, an exceptionally large gap between the spot price and the nearby futures price implies that the futures contract will earn high returns simply because its price drifts (rolls up) toward the high spot price.

Several empirical studies show that backwardated commodities tend to have higher subsequent returns than commodities in contango. Recall from Figure 11.8 that average long-run returns of commodity futures are largely explained by their average roll returns. In addition, I ran some historical regressions using WTI Crude Oil futures since 1987. The data seem split between the expectations and risk premium hypotheses. Steep backwardation predicts falling spot prices (to offset the roll advantage of longer futures); when the subsequent spot price change is regressed on the roll (futures-implied price change), the coefficient is 0.5. Steep backwardation also predicts future excess returns; when next month excess return is regressed on the roll, the slope coefficient (PF) is also 0.5. Some agricultural futures may exhibit even greater predictability of spot price changes, given the seasonally steep backwardation associated with scarcity (low inventories) and short-lived spot price spikes.

# Housing

Rental yield is the most common carry measure in real estate markets. The analogue to the twin hypotheses above is that relatively low rental yield may reflect either market expectations of faster price appreciation or lower required total returns. Some empirical studies suggest that low rental yields (say, in "hot" cities) coincide with persistently and predictably faster house price appreciation. Other evidence links low rental yields with low future returns.


# Volatility

Comparing options with different maturities, an inverted volatility term structure may not only predict falling volatility (typically market expectations of mean reversion from high volatility levels) but may also signal abnormally high rewards for volatility selling. Carr-Wu (2009) regress future realized variances on variance swap rates (separately for various stock indices and some individual stocks), testing the expectations hypothesis. Coefficient values are typically below one, suggesting that a time-varying volatility premium also plays a role. High prices for variance swaps predict high future realized volatilities but also an abnormally high reward for volatility selling. I find a similar split between PEH-like and risk premium hypotheses in the FX market when I study implied volatilities for the EUR/USD exchange rate.

# 22.4 CONCLUSIONS

Empirical evidence clearly shows that carry measures are better at predicting near-term asset returns than at forecasting future rate or price changes that would offset initial yield advantage. Yield-seeking strategies have been profitable in all asset classes studied. Thus, risk premium hypotheses are pretty well supported by data, while hypotheses relying on risk-neutral investors (UIP, PEH, and other expectations hypotheses) fare poorly.

However, this verdict may be too critical of expectations hypotheses. In many cases, the data partly support an expectations hypothesis. Even when they do not—recall the empirical violations of the PEH in interest rate markets—the outcome could reflect investor irrationality and expectational errors. As stressed above, empirical evidence of return predictability cannot distinguish between rational and irrational explanations. When we use information from consensus forecasts to proxy for the market's rate expectations, near-term return predictability appears to be due more to biased investor expectations than to time-varying risk premia (see Chapter 23). In addition, my analysis of yield curve behavior in Section 9.4 suggests that mean-reverting rate expectations are a key driver of the changing yield curve shape over time. Overall, I conclude that carry reflects both required risk premia and the market's rate and/or price expectations.

Investors should not seek yield too blindly. One reason is that yield-seekers often move in a crowd and thus are vulnerable to crowding and de-leveraging risks. Another pitfall is that if a country gradually drifts toward hyperinflation, and market expectations capture this prospect, mechanical yield-seeking investors will maintain long currency or interest rate positions until they have lost all their purchasing power. Finally, naive yield-seekers are prey to abuse by ruthless sellers. Some products have high notional yields and yet low prospective returns, due to high default risk, embedded options, or other complex features that conceal elevated risks and costs.

# 22.5 NOTES

[1] In theory, expected returns may be equal across assets if risk premia are bid to zero and assets are fairly priced. In a risk-neutral world, all assets have the same expected return, and that return is the riskless rate (expected return on the riskless asset). Not all investors need to be risk neutral; it is sufficient to assume that there are some risk-neutral arbitrageurs who are both extremely smart (can correctly identify any ex ante opportunities) and rich (have infinitely deep pockets so that they won't be stopped out if trades go temporarily against them). Such arbitrageurs would take advantage of any expected return differentials and remove them. In reality, even the most risk-tolerant investors—hedge funds, private equity funds, and sovereign wealth funds—are risk averse (just less so than other investors), make mistakes, and face capital constraints. These investor groups' profit-seeking activities have narrowed expected return differentials across assets—but they have not fully eliminated them.
The risk neutrality assumption is central in derivatives-pricing literature. Relative-pricing models, starting from the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, rely on arbitrage arguments and do not concern themselves with the level of expected asset returns. It is convenient to assume risk-neutral pricing even if risk neutrality is a poor description of the real world. There is no contradiction because derivative-pricing formulas do not rely on the risk neutrality of real-world investors. Using arbitrage arguments and certain assumptions, it is possible to show that derivative instruments, traded together with underlying assets, give riskless payoffs and thus should earn the same return as the riskless asset. One can compute relative derivatives prices in a risk-neutral world and expect these "arbitrage-free" prices to hold even in the real world. The beauty of the Black-Scholes-Merton model and its descendants is that no information on expected returns of underlying assets (stocks, bonds) is needed for pricing and hedging derivatives. Conversely, these models tell us nothing about those expected returns.
[2] The irrational paradigm allows a third alternative interpretation: that spread reflects the market's rate expectations but that these are systematically biased. The stories of biased expectations and time-varying risk premia have the same empirical implications: high yields tend to predict high near-term returns. Because expectations and risk premia are not directly observable, we cannot empirically distinguish between these two stories. Thus, even if historical analysis shows that yield spreads predict near-term returns, it cannot tell whether the time variation in expected returns is caused by irrational market expectations or by required risk premia. (We can address this question only if we take survey consensus forecasts as a proxy for the market's rate expectations.)
[3] I discuss these issues in Section 7.1 and in Ilmanen (1996). Given the broader audience for this book, I focus here on the loose concept of curve steepness (or term spread). I leave out various details, including a more exact treatment of forward rates.

Source notes. For interpreting yield spreads, see Fama (1984) and Fama-Bliss (1987) who pioneered complementary regressions that explore whether yield spreads better predict future rate changes or excess returns (also see Ilmanen, 1996). For comparable empirical analyses in equities and volatilities, see Cochrane (2008a) and Carr-Wu (2009). It was Leibowitz-Bader-Kogelman (1995) who came up with the term "persistence factor".

# Survey-based subjective expected returns

- Survey-based expected returns provide useful real-time information about investor views.
- Representativeness and timeliness problems can cause survey forecasts to be noisy proxies of the market's expectations.
- Consensus forecasts may not be great predictors of the future and may not even be rational. This would not preclude a survey from being unbiased and representative, as the same criticism can apply to market forecasts.
- If survey evidence is taken at face value, it can help distinguish between rational and irrational interpretations of return predictability.
Retail survey views of prospective equity returns tend to be procyclical, in contrast to countercyclical estimates from market valuation indicators.

The market's expected returns and rate expectations are not directly observable (with the exception of the prospective return of a horizon-matching default-free bond). Under the rational paradigm, any evidence that econometric forecasting models or valuation measures can predict future returns is interpreted as time variation in the market's reasoned return expectations. Empirical forecasting and/or valuation signals typically indicate that objectively feasible future equity market returns are low after several years of high realized returns and rising valuation ratios. This could reflect rational investors accepting lower expected returns due to lower perceived risk or it could reflect risk aversion in good times. However, an irrational alternative explanation is that systematic forecasting error or time-varying sentiment causes return predictability. Consensus forecasts are one way to proxy market expectations; retail surveys, especially, suggest that subjective investor expectations are irrationally high after extended booms and low following downturns. Hence the tension between objective and subjective expected return concepts: many academic studies see (objectively) high expected returns when investors are at their most pessimistic while most laypeople associate (subjectively) high expected returns with bull market peaks.

I take surveys more seriously than most academics have done; fortunately, there is growing interest in this area. Given the importance of time-varying expected returns I think that survey-based premia are often the most honest measures of subjective real-time ex ante premia. Surveys are likely to be roughly right because they are timely, simple, and intuitive—evidence "straight from the horse's mouth". In contrast, more complex and formal approaches—inflaming market expectations based on theoretical or statistical models—are sometimes unrealistic and use hindsight that was not available to investors in real time [1].

Note that surveys may be poor predictors of future asset price moves or future economic developments because forecasting such events is inherently difficult. Professional forecasters are an easy target for critics such as Nassim Taleb and James Montier. Others criticize survey forecasts for being inefficient and irrational. Even if this is true, the same criticism may apply to markets. Thus, even if their predictive record is no better than that of a coin toss, survey-based consensus forecasts may still be unbiased and representative proxies of market views.

# Box 23.1. Problems with survey data

- Unbiasedness/Representativeness. Some economists ignore survey data because talk is cheap, while market prices reflect people putting their money where their mouth is. Gaming and dishonest responses are possible, but inattentiveness seems a greater incentive problem to me. How unbiased or representative are surveys of the views they are supposed to be reflecting? Most individual biases wash out in the consensus view. Some surveys are systematically biased for a reason: analysts' overoptimistic earnings forecasts reflect incentive or agency issues, and corporations' overoptimistic pension return assumptions make it possible to manipulate earnings. Such forecasts have been rightly criticized in the past decade. Many other surveys may be unbiased but may not be representative. I think economist polls are representative for predicting macro-fundamentals and short-term rates but less so for predicting long-term yields, let alone equities and other risky assets. It is conceptually not even clear what survey would be representative of the equity market—certainly not a democratic poll of the whole population, but perhaps a wealth-weighted poll of professional investors.
- Timeliness/Staleness problems. Many surveys ask about future market prices and/ or yields. To translate these point forecasts into predicted returns, survey forecasts need to be compared with market prices or yields at the time of the survey. Such date matching is inexact because institutional forecasters often use the institution's latest published forecast, which can be stale by the survey date.
- Mean/Median/Mode. Outlier responses in surveys often reflect data errors or ignorant participants. The simplest remedy is to use the median response among survey participants, instead of the mean, as the consensus forecast. Another problem is that many survey participants report their base case scenario (the mode, or most likely outcome) instead of a probability-weighted average of many scenarios. If most respondents agree on the base scenario and on the most important asymmetric risk scenario, the survey may not capture this asymmetry. For example, U.S. long-run inflation forecasts have been well-anchored near  $2.5\%$  since the late 1990s but the stability in published forecasts may conceal how the main risk has shifted over time between deflation and inflation concerns. New European data show a positive relation between the inflation risk premium and the skewness of inflation forecasts.

The Philadelphia Fed has published annually (since 1992) a survey of expected 10-year returns of Treasury bills, bonds, and stocks, as well as 10-year inflation. From these series we can also infer estimates of the bond risk premium over bills (BRP) and the equity risk premium over bonds (ERP). The narrowing gap between the middle two lines in Figure 23.1 suggests a decline in BRP from  $2.5\%$  to a low of  $0.5\%$  in 2007, followed by a rebound (one that is not evident in the blue-chip surveys discussed below). The ERP has been more stable but only around  $2\%$ , except for a spike in 1994. This is an exceptional survey in that it polls respondents directly about the expected returns of each asset class. The professional forecasters that are surveyed are typically economists; I would think that they are reasonably representative of fixed income investors but less representative of equity investors.

Section 8.5 reviews evidence regarding professional and retail investors' subjective equity return forecasts. Retail investors' return forecasts appear to be overly extrapolative and optimistic (especially after bull markets). The three retail surveys discussed in Section 8.5 used different investment horizons and covered different periods between 1998 and 2006. In the University of Michigan survey of wealthy investors, return forecasts are higher following strong market returns and during perceived good economic times, and lower following equity downturns and during recessions. This procyclical pattern contrasts with the countercyclical pattern found in rational return expectations that are based on econometric forecasting models and valuation ratios. Another study finds revealing differences across investors around the turn of the millennium: younger investors, less experienced investors, and those with better investment success were more optimistic. Professional investors and CFOs have given forecasts more in line with forward-looking market valuation indicators. Notably, survey forecasts of the long-term equity premium rose between 2007 and 2008 as markets sold off.

Unlike the ERP, the survey-based BRP introduced in Chapter 9 is not directly queried in surveys but is the difference between market yield and the consensus forecast of future interest rates. My main data source for the BRP is the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey, published semiannually since 1983, which unfortunately only covers decades with falling inflation and yields. To complement the BRP for the 10-year Treasury, Figure 23.2 also shows BRPs from money markets, contrasting three different survey forecasts—the first of which (Goldsmith-Nagan) dates back to 1969—with matching Treasury bill forward rates [2]. Although details vary, all of the series share similar contours. BRPs trended higher during the 1970s, peaked between 1979 and 1985, and then trended lower for 20 years. The 10-year BRP is the series I highlighted in Chapter 9 as my favorite measure of ex ante reward for bearing duration risk.

The above exercise takes survey-based consensus forecasts at face value as if they exactly represented market expectations at the survey time. In reality, there are measurement errors (depending on the representativeness and timeliness of the survey) but these can be lessened. Other methods to extract expected returns also involve noise (as well as hindsight not present in survey data). The noise in theoretical or empirical model-based expected returns is related to the empirical validity of the particular assumptions behind the model. The tradeoff between measurement errors in surveys, on the one hand, and specification and estimation errors in model-based approaches, on the other hand, is an under-researched topic. Perhaps the best approach is to combine both types of data as Kim-Orphanides (2007) do when studying term premia: using a theoretical term structure model but using survey data as one admittedly noisy input—an input that is not available if one is restricted to using only market yield data.

Besides consensus forecasts, survey evidence about uncertainty, disagreement, and asymmetric views may contain information about future asset returns.

Survey evidence—if taken seriously—can help distinguish between rational and irrational explanations for asset return predictability. New studies by Bacchetta-Mertens-van Wincoop (2009) and Piazzesi-Schneider (2008) suggest that much of the observed asset return predictability in classic predictive regressions is not related to ex ante (survey-based) risk premia but rather to systematic forecasting errors—or perhaps just to overfitting/hindsight by the econometrician running the classic predictive regressions.


Finally, I mention one important set of long-run expected returns: expert views on multiple asset classes. I am not aware of efforts to collect these views from several contributors, but here are two famous examples that are regularly published. The Yale Endowment (2009) assumes  $6\%$  long-run real returns for developed market stocks ( $8\%$  for emerging markets),  $2\%$  for fixed income,  $6\%$  for real assets, and  $11\%$  for private equity (incorporating an assumption that Yale can pick good managers). These forecasts are very slow moving and do not appear very sensitive to market valuations. In contrast, the GMO Quarterly Letter's seven-year asset class forecasts are highly dependent on perceived valuations: the latest forecasts in Grantham (2010) predict  $2.9\%$  annual real returns for U.S. large-cap stocks,  $4.9\%$  for non-U.S. large-caps, and  $6.6\%$  for emerging market stocks. Small-cap stocks are predicted to fare less well and high-quality stocks better. Government bonds are expected to deliver near  $0\%$  annual real returns, but  $2.2\%$  for emerging market bonds.

# 23.1 NOTES

[1] Overall, I want to encourage central banks, sell-side firms, and other financial institutions to conduct and publish more investor surveys. Time series of such surveys—standalone or linked to market data—can help us better analyze and understand asset market movements and valuations. In my old sell-side strategist role, each quarter I polled  $100+$  global investors on their long-term inflation and interest rate views.
[2] Specifically, the *Blue Chip* forecast of next decade average Treasury bill rate is compared with the 10-year Treasury yield. Goldsmith-Nagan survey forecasts of 3-month rates three months hence are compared each quarter with 3-month-forward 3-month Treasury bill rates implied in market pricing. Likewise, the *Wall Street Journal*'s semiannual survey forecasts of 6-month Treasury bill rates six months hence are compared with 6-month-forward 6-month Treasury bill rates. Finally, *Consensus Economics* survey forecasts of 3-month rates three and 12 months hence are used to estimate the expected average money market rate for the year beyond the first three months. This expectation is then compared with the matching forward rate. The advantage of the last approach is that the results are less sensitive to the assumed timing of the survey, when the survey forecast is compared with market forward rates from a particular day. While current yield levels can vary quite a bit day to day, spreads among different maturity rates are more stable. I use term structure data from the Federal Reserve Board and from Citigroup to estimate forward rates for Treasury bills.

# Tactical return forecasting models

- Systematic forecasting models may focus on (1) timing a single asset or an asset pair or (2) selecting a portfolio across a cross-section of assets.
- Such models often use multiple indicators, such as value, carry, and momentum.
- The trading horizon can vary from within-day to a year. A monthly or weekly trading frequency is common.
- Numerous techniques have been applied to return forecasting. In out-of-sample evaluations, simple models often perform just as well as more complex ones.
- Data mining and crowding problems are inevitable. They can be mitigated but not fully avoided.

# 24.1 INTRODUCTION

Valuation indicators are effective in providing a long-horizon (multi-year) view on an asset's prospects. In this chapter, I turn to dynamic trading strategies and forecasting models that have a shorter horizon (one week, month, or quarter). I first describe the generics—model types, assets traded, indicators—and then comment on possible improvements and pitfalls for the systematic trading style. I keep this chapter brief so as to retain some of my proprietary trade secrets, but Chapters 8 through 10 review several publicly known market-timing indicators for equities, duration, and credit, while Chapters 12 through 15 review four popular dynamic trading strategies: equity value, foreign exchange carry, commodity momentum, and volatility selling.

What types of models are used? Single-trade timing models and multi-asset selection models are the two main classes. Dynamic strategies may focus on (1) timing a single asset (say, market timing Treasury bonds) or a single asset pair (say, sector timing the yield spread between corporate credits and Treasuries) or (2) selecting a portfolio of assets from a broader universe. Leveraged investors often construct a long-short portfolio that may be superior to a long-only portfolio because the former hedges away some directional risks.

Which assets are typically traded? Any liquid assets can be traded on a standalone basis (directionally) or on a relative value basis. Liquidity and low trading costs are more important the shorter the trading horizon.

What kind of predictive indicators are used? Both timing models and selection models can use a multitude of indicators. The best known are related to value, carry, and momentum. I discuss various types of models.

# 24.2 WHAT TYPE OF MODEL?

# Timing models

The simplest timing model is a binary trend-following model that goes long or short an asset based on its recent price trend. But there is no need to rely only on the price of the asset itself as an indicator, or for that matter on any single indicator. I illustrate these ideas with a bond market (duration) timing model. One possible single-indicator model is to go long one unit of Treasuries if equity markets have performed poorly in recent months but to sell short one unit if equity markets have been strong. (This model may be called “ $1/ - 1$ ” in Treasury bond units held long/units held short. Another variant—the “ $1/0$ ” trading model—might never sell Treasury bonds short but only invest in cash when faced with a bond-bearish signal.)

Multiple indicators can be used, and each can be expressed as a simple binary (bullish/ bearish) signal, as above, or each can be scaled by current signal strength and/or perceived predictive ability.

There are a number of ways to aggregate multiple indicators into a composite market-timing signal. The simplest approach involves averaging individual indicators using equally weighted binary signals. For example, Figure 24.1 shows the monthly signals and cumulative profits of a duration-timing model whose composite signal (and thus active Treasury position) is an average of three  $1 / -1$  trading signals—bullish if equities have lost money in the past six months, if bond market momentum is positive, or if bond carry is positive. This particular duration-timing strategy achieved an SR of 0.66 and a hit rate of  $60\%$  (i.e., the correct sign in  $60\%$  of months).

A slightly smarter timing model is based on a straightforward linear regression approach. We can identify a set of predictive indicators with which we forecast the next period (say, next month) excess return of Treasuries over cash. Predicting excess returns makes sense because timing trades often involve a self-financed long or short position in an underlying asset or an equivalent derivatives position [1]. Mechanically, we just regress monthly excess Treasury returns on a set of indicators that are available at the beginning of the month—preferably using at least five years of monthly data. The fitted value in this regression is predicted excess Treasury return for next month. One approach is to size the position each month according to this fitted value. To evaluate the model's past track record, we can study the correlation of these fitted values with actual monthly excess returns; alternatively, we can compute the hit rate (how often the model predicted the correct sign of next month market direction) or, most practically, the Sharpe ratio of a trading rule based on the model's prescribed positions.

We can strengthen our understanding of the regression model's mechanics if we normalize all indicators before running the forecasting regression. (Normalizing or "Z-scoring" involves subtracting the sample mean from each series and then dividing by sample standard deviation.) Such a modified regression has the same fitted values as before but now the contribution of each predictor is in units that are quite intuitive. The regression coefficient (multiple regression beta) of each predictor now equals the partial correlation between the predictor and next month excess Treasury return—a pure statistical measure of predictive ability [2]. Thus, the contribution of each indicator to predicted excess bond return is a product of the "β" and "Z" terms (i.e., the indicator's past predictive ability and its current signal strength). Total predicted excess return can be conveniently decomposed into the sum of these contributions plus the regression intercept. Table 24.1 shows a stylized example.

In this modified regression, the intercept reflects the sample mean of excess bond return. If this sample mean appears too high and misleading for the future—arguably reflecting the strong bond rally that occurred in the past—we can easily constrain this mean to be a lower number and thus reduce "neutral" future excess return (the return forecast that would make us indifferent between bonds and cash). I emphasize that these convenient interpretations of the regression model are possible only after all predictive indicators have been normalized. One interesting extension involves incorporating economic priors into the regression. If there is a strong case for, say, only a positive relation between an indicator (say, curve steepness) and future returns, one can constrain the relevant regression coefficient to be non-negative.

More complex variants of a market-timing model exist, including nonlinear models and data-intensive learning models. Yet complexity does not necessarily enhance performance, and these two approaches—summing up binary signals and using a normalized regression model—are among the most popular in practice. It is worth contrasting how differently the two approaches use the same information set. The first approach only sums up the signs of various predictors; it thus ignores information about each indicator's signal strength, predictive ability, and diversification ability which the regression model captures by incorporating signal strengths and partial correlations. However, the simplicity of the first approach can make it more robust, not an insignificant advantage. Indeed, in real-world comparisons, simple approaches are often competitive with any theoretically superior approaches.

# Cross-asset selection models

Timing models can be extended to analyze pre-selected asset pairs or sector decisions. Typically, a correlated pair is identified and tracked over time; once excessive deviation from historical relations occurs, a mean-reverting long-short trade may be put on to benefit from expected normalization. Many fixed income arbitrage strategies and equity pairs trading strategies (the latter being original statistical arbitrage) were based on this idea, which was implemented using some simple spread analysis or more complex statistical models (e.g., co-integration and error correction) or mathematical models (such as term structure models). Again, it often makes sense to use multiple predictors, and this is commonly done when timing the relative performance of corporate vs. government debt or of growth stocks vs. value stocks.

The above examples involve favoring one of two pre-selected assets. It is of course restrictive to pre-select just two candidate assets. More open asset selection models study a whole cross-section of assets—say, the largest 1,000 stocks in the U.S. equity market, or the G10 currencies—and identify the most and least attractive assets in this universe based on some criteria [3].

If we only use one criterion, we can just sort or rank all assets each period based on that criterion. Two popular approaches—due to their empirical success in recent decades—rank U.S. equities based on some value measure, or the G10 currencies based on carry (see Chapters 12–13). A leveraged long-short strategy would then select some top-ranked assets to buy and some bottom-ranked assets to sell. (A constrained long-only investor may only be able to use the information about the top half. This fact gives a key advantage to unconstrained investors such as hedge funds, and has recently prompted relaxation of the long-only constraint among many previously constrained investors; it has also aided introduction of so-called 130/30 funds.)

Cross-sectional strategies, too, are often based on multiple indicators, and this again complicates analysis. How should the various inputs (criteria) be combined? In practice, there are two common approaches: composite-ranking models and cross-sectional regressions.

A composite-ranking model can be as simple as sorting assets along a set of indicators and then taking an average of an asset's ranks across the various indicators as its "total score". A low total score implies an attractive average rank in many dimensions. For example, G10 currencies may be traded based on their average ranks along carry, momentum, and value criteria. I have used this approach in Ilmanen-Sayood (2002) and noted that it works surprisingly well.

Analogous to the discussion about simple binary models vs. regression models for single-asset timing, this simple ranking approach misses information about signal strength, past predictive ability, and diversification ability in different indicators that would be captured by a more formal optimization model.

Cross-sectional regressions help disentangle many correlated influences on asset returns and identify their distinct rewards. Consider cross-sectional regression of U.S. equity excess returns on various risk factors and other characteristics (say, estimated market beta, market capitalization, book-to-market ratio, and recent price momentum). By construction, the estimated slope coefficients in such cross-sectional regressions reflect the reward for each factor or characteristic while keeping the others constant. That is, the slope coefficient represents the return of a "factor-mimicking portfolio" that has maximal correlation with one factor and zero correlations with all other factors. Such cross-sectional regressions are run each period and then the slope coefficient of each factor or characteristic is averaged over time to give an estimated "pure" premium for the factor or characteristic. Past average factor premia can be used as inputs into portfolio construction—or the expected premia may be forecast using an econometric model. If the model is taken at face value, it gives the expected returns of each asset as a function of the asset's factor exposures or characteristics and estimated expected factor premia. However, these estimates are subject to measurement errors (even if we ignore likely time variation in these premia, many factor exposures are estimated with noise), and to specification errors (the model may omit important factors, the assumption of linear relations may be faulty, etc.).

# Combining models

While I will not review portfolio construction issues in this book beyond the discussion in Chapter 28, I note that so-called Black-Litterman optimizers are particularly well suited for combining information from systematic trading models. Black-Litterman optimizers enable (i) blending historical experience with anchoring priors (such as perceived market equilibrium returns) and/or with active views; (ii) inputting expected return views on particular trades (instead of on each asset separately); and (iii) incorporating a measure of uncertainty for each view. Both inputs from trading model backtests (quality of trading performance, current signal strength) and the user's subjective assessments of model reliability can be included. New studies have extended the classic model beyond the mean variance world.

# 24.3 WHICH ASSETS/TRADES?

Active trading requires liquidity, the more so the higher the trading frequency. It is important to assess the tradeoff between higher gross gains in any dynamic trading strategy and the associated increase in trading costs. High-turnover strategies (fast signals) implemented at high frequencies require either very high gross Sharpe ratios or low trading costs, preferably both. Low-turnover strategies (slow signals) can afford lower gross Sharpe ratios or higher trading costs. For a given rate of turnover, less liquid assets have higher trading costs.

Equities may be traded directionally (market timing) or on a relative value basis (stock selection). Between these two extremes, we can take active positions across countries, across industry sectors, or across styles. Fixed income can likewise be traded directionally (duration timing), on a relative value basis (issue selection) and on a sector basis along many dimensions (maturities, countries, sectors, credit ratings—and mixing these dimensions by, say, boxing government curve flatteners with credit curve steepeners). Commodities are mostly traded directionally but specialists can put on active positions along the futures term structure, across commodities, or between commodity futures and commodity-related stocks or currencies.

While I discuss systematic strategies here, it is important to remember that most investors and traders are discretionary, and there are diverse paths to success. Some hedge funds focus on one market niche (say, emerging markets, distressed debt, or merger arbitrage), while other funds take a broader view and trade across asset classes (global tactical asset allocation, capital structure arbitrage, or convertible arbitrage). Some of the all-time great investors were generalists, but the majority of successful traders are probably discretionary specialists in one area.

# 24.4 WHICH INDICATOR TYPES?

Investors use a large variety of trading signals and there is no consensus how these could best be classified. The most popular themes are value, carry, and momentum, but many other indicators do not belong to these styles. Table 24.2 suggests one plausible classification scheme—price patterns, seasonals, other indicators—and presents examples of each for both time series and cross-sectional trading.

Price patterns (information discernible from the asset's own price). Short-term and/or medium-term momentum as well as long-term reversal are common tendencies of many asset return series—and even of many dynamic strategies. Yet, the exact patterns observed for cross-sectional equity trading do not travel well. That is, few other asset classes share the exact timing observed in equities: relative reversal patterns for the first

Seasonal regularities will be discussed in Chapter 25 but few are strong enough to be exploited.

"Other indicators" include the kitchen sink. Carry and value are important, but the list also includes macroeconomic indicators, supply-demand factors, sentiment, liquidity and risk indicators, and others. Underreactions to news and lead-lag effects across asset markets are close cousins to (own price) momentum, but are included here.

An alternative classification scheme contrasts convergent and divergent strategies. Convergent strategies rely on relationships in markets moving toward their long-term averages and include carry seeking, relative value, mean reversion, and volatility selling. Divergent strategies rely on market relationships moving further away from their long-term averages and include trend following, momentum, and volatility buying.

Yet another scheme focuses on the investment time horizon and the speed of information decay in indicators. As a classic example, the information in value indicators decays slowly while that in short-term momentum or reversal indicators decays fast. This book focuses on strategies traded at relatively low frequencies. High-frequency trading strategies—especially active within-day trading—are seldom based on economic intuition and are feasible only for traders facing the lowest trading costs anyway. Such strategies often exploit short-term price reversals and effectively act as liquidity suppliers.

# 24.5 ENHANCEMENTS AND PITFALLS

# Enhancements

The strategies above imply stable relations between asset returns and predictors, as they involve market timing one asset or trading long-short pairs or portfolios across assets "in any weather". It seems plausible that style timing can refine these strategies by identifying conditions when these strategies are more likely to excel or fail. These conditions may reflect the general market environment (e.g., carry trading is known to underperform amidst heightened volatility and tightening liquidity). Style timing may also be based on the strategy's own history—many strategies' returns exhibit a mild version of well-known short-run momentum and long-run reversal patterns—as well as on seasonal patterns. Contextual models give the cross-sectional equivalent to style timing: they identify subsets of the asset universe where a given strategy is more likely to excel or fail. For example, trend following works better for poorly anchored macrotrades than for well-anchored micro-trades, while many stock selection strategies work better for small-cap than for large-cap stocks, at least on paper. Chapters 12 through 14 provide examples of such enhancements.

Improvements can come in other areas. Many investment managers put as much effort into smart portfolio construction, risk management, and implementation efficiency (cheaper and/or faster execution, and other cost saving) as they do on alpha generation through return forecasts. Quants use data-intensive learning algorithms for model selection, Kalman filter methods for dynamic parameter estimation, regime-switching models to capture instability in predictive relations, Bayesian or robust optimizers to replace standard mean variance optimizers, and other methods.

# Pitfalls

Data mining. In-sample regressions exaggerate a model's predictive ability. Since regression coefficients may evolve over time, it is more realistic to run rolling "out-of-sample" regressions over time, estimating coefficients each month using only the data available to investors in real time. Even this approach does involve some lookahead bias because a model's indicator selections are likely motivated, in part, by information gathered in hindsight. Chapter 7 discusses data mining further and argues that it is an inevitable feature of systematic trading models. The use of nonstationary (highly persistent) time series as predictors and applying long-horizon regressions are especially likely to result in econometric problems and spurious findings.

Overcrowding. Another shortcoming in systematic strategies is that their transparency makes them easy to replicate and therefore more exposed than discretionary strategies to consensus positioning or crowding risk. The 1998 and 2007-2008 experiences suggest that all systematic strategies—not just risk-seeking carry strategies—may be subject to de-leveraging risks when financial conditions tighten. Moreover, technological advances and greater data availability have made any observed regularities ever more fleeting as they quickly attract profit-seeking competition. Taming these endogenous risks is a new but central challenge for systematic investors (see Chapter 20).

# 24.6 NOTES

[1] Every long position is assumed to be financed by a cash money market rate and every short position involves re-investing the proceeds in the cash market. Cash returns for a long-short position naturally wash out. In reality, short selling is not quite so easy in equity markets but in Treasury, currency, and futures markets these approximations are reasonable.
[2] Partial correlation is simple correlation adjusted for the influence of other predictors. This is the same distinction as between a multiple regression beta and a simple regression beta. If different predictors are uncorrelated with each other, there is no difference between simple and partial correlations. High overlap between any two predictors raises the gap between simple and partial correlations; intuitively, their predictive impact should not be double-counted. Raw regression betas—without normalization—would also reflect the different relative volatilities of predictors as well as their correlations.
[3] Cross-sectional asset selection strategies are seen to benefit from a broader opportunity set and are better diversified than market-timing models. It is true that timing the whole market involves particularly concentrated risk. However, if we combine long-short timing models for several assets, the resulting composite portfolio may not differ much from that of a cross-sectional long-short strategy.

# Seasonal regularities

- Seasonal patterns in average returns are often weak, possibly spurious, and costly to exploit.
- The best known seasonal pattern is the January effect. Not just small-cap stocks but also the most volatile stocks and high-yield credits earn much of their outperformance in January.
- The January effect and other regularities that appear related—the January barometer and the Hallow'en effect—may be due to seasonally high investor risk appetite at the beginning of the year. This story is closer to the traditional window-dressing explanation than to the tax-loss-selling explanation. Other evidence on heightened gambling preferences around New Year's Day supports this story.
- For commodity prices, seasonals can be pronounced for sound economic reasons (supply and demand).

# 25.1 SEASONAL, CYCLICAL, AND SECULAR PATTERNS IN ASSET RETURNS

This chapter and the next two cover seasonal, cyclical, and secular patterns in historical returns. Calendar seasonals can be within day, day of week, day of month, or month of year. Other seasonals cover patterns as diverse as announcement day, pre-holiday, lunar cycle, harvesting season, and political cycle. I focus on monthly seasonals and especially the most robust seasonal: January-related effects.

Most published seasonal studies deal with equity market regularities. I review empirical evidence in both equity and other markets. Historically, average equity market returns have been high in December-January and negative in September-October. In contrast, government bonds have earned low returns early in the year and high returns in the autumn. So what? How much of these patterns are spurious and sample specific?

The health warnings I make throughout the book may be especially important for seasonal regularities. It is easy to data-mine the one financial markets history which we have experienced that the danger of overfitting is huge. In addition, seasonal regularities are vulnerable to competitive speculators trying to anticipate and exploit them and thereby eroding them. For example, the famous January effect has been known to work in late December, and the turn-of-the-month effect has also shifted earlier. Many other seasonalities weakened or even disappeared after they became widely known. Finally, many patterns are so mild that trading costs eat most, if not all, of the paper profits for strategies that try to exploit them. One practical cost-effective approach may be to delay or avoid executing trades (that are motivated by broader reasons) when seasonal indicators give a clearly opposite short-term signal.


# 25.2 MONTHLY SEASONALS AND THE JANUARY EFFECT

The pattern that really stands out from Figure 25.1 is the January effect. This seasonal is apparent in many kinds of risk-taking strategies but especially strong for carry seeking (including credit carry, FX carry, and long U.S. dollar) and for small-cap stock and value stock overweights. The exception is that momentum and trend-following strategies tend to outperform in December and underperform (reverse) in January.

Why such seasonality? It is baffling that a large part of the long-term return advantage of one asset over another is earned in just one month of a year. The classic explanations are tax-loss selling and institutional window dressing. In addition, I review seasonal variations in investor risk appetite and in the market's liquidity conditions.

Tax-loss selling puts general pressure on asset prices before the year end, perhaps especially on past losers and on less liquid assets.

Institutional window dressing refers to the desire to show safe, liquid, and successful investments in the books when holdings are revealed at year end (and subject to greater scrutiny and publicity in annual reports). Such window-dressing motives prompt institutions to buy more government debt and recently-outperforming assets in November and December, so as to make the portfolio look as though it had been better all along.

It seems plausible that general investor risk appetite peaks early in the calendar year as investors "start afresh" in January, and then gradually recedes during the year. Institutional desire to show conservative portfolios at year end may not be the only reason for such a seasonal change in risk appetite: many traders and fund managers earn their bonuses for a calendar year and get their drawdown limits refreshed every New Year.

New empirical research supports the idea of seasonally high risk appetite—or gambling preference, lottery seeking—at the beginning of the year. Doran-Jiang-Peterson (2009) show that lottery-type stocks (low price, high volatility, high skewness) outperform in Januaries and underperform the rest of the year. They also document more exuberant gambling in Las Vegas and the greater relative richness of OTM call options vs. ATM options in January than in other months. Interestingly, Chinese lottery-type stocks outperform around the Chinese New Year rather than in January.

If trading costs are high enough, even modest systematic valuation differences between late December and early January can explain these patterns. Little actual trading may occur when quoted prices fall before the year end and rebound thereafter. Lower liquidity and high trading costs may thus explain why this seasonal is so strong for small-cap stocks and corporate bonds.

Figure 25.2 drills into the January seasonality of long U.S. time series over the past 40 years and over the preceding 43 years. The patterns look consistent across the two subperiods: a moderately stronger equity premium in January than in other months; much higher small-cap, value, and reversal premia in January; and negative momentum in Januaries. However, to avoid getting carried away, I note that for both the equity premium and the value premium the sign flipped for the past 20 years: January returns were below average, perhaps reflecting the fact that the seasonal had been discovered.

Turning to a broader set of investments, Figure 25.3 presents evidence for only the 1970-2009 period. The contrast is most striking for the performance of high-volatility stocks relative to low-volatility stocks. High-yield debt, FX carry, and the U.S. dollar also tend to make money in January and fare much less well in other months. Oil and long-duration bonds have the opposite pattern, while broad equity markets and trend-following strategies do not have exceptional January returns.

More detailed studies show that the bulk of the January effect comes in the first few days of the year. The pattern is also found in many other countries, though not in all.

In some cases, cross-country differences may be explained by different tax years (in the U.S. the tax year coincides with the calendar year).

Certain seasonal patterns appear surprisingly robust over time. Figure 25.4 shows that equity, value, and carry premia are earned both during January and in other months, but more consistently in January. Small-cap stock premia have by and large only been earned during Januaries, while the bond term premium has only been earned outside Januaries. Most remarkably, the realized credit premium has been positive in January and net negative in other months, and high-volatility stocks have only outperformed in January and underperformed in other months. Conversely, the equity momentum strategy has lost money in Januaries but more than made up for it in other months. Meanwhile, both short-term and long-term reversal strategies shine in January (not shown). The abrupt shift from high risk aversion to high risk appetite at New Year is one way to explain the January success of reversal strategies and losses in momentum-like strategies.

Evidence on the seasonality of liquidity effects is more mixed. Liquidity conditions tend to be low in the holiday season before the New Year and quickly improve after it. Money market credit spreads exhibited a strong "turn" effect (spreads widening into the year end) until central banks began to tackle year end liquidity shortage with aggressive liquidity provision. A recent study by Watanabe-Watanabe (2008) highlights the strong time variation in equity market liquidity conditions and premia, with a distinct January seasonality. Stocks' liquidity betas are shown to vary across two distinct states: a short-lived, abnormal high-beta state (high liquidity needs, high volatility, wide dispersion in liquidity betas across single stocks, high reward for bearing liquidity risk) and a more persistent, normal low-beta state. The high-liquidity-beta state occurs in  $59\%$  of Januaries but only in  $14\%$  of other months. This evidence is in line with January outperformance of small-cap stocks and corporate bonds—which may reflect these assets' inferior liquidity as much as their greater riskiness. However, illiquidity shocks based on the Amihud measure are only mildly negative in January, and the Pastor-Stambaugh portfolio of high-liquidity-risk vs. low-liquidity-risk beta stocks actually makes its net profits outside January (the third pair of bars in Figure 25.3).

Note: Each panel sums up over time the monthly excess return of a given investment separately for Januaries and for non-January months between 1927 and 2009. Excess return is the difference between the monthly return of a long portfolio and a short portfolio: thus it is expressed as a percentage of the long position's size. The eight panels cover three pages and include (a) the equity premium, (b) value (stock) premium, (c) carry premium (since 1970), (d) small-cap (stock) premium, (e) credit-vs.-Treasury premium, (f) high-volatility (stock) premium (since 1963), (g) bond (term) premium, and (h) momentum (stock) premium. Note that there are 11 "non-January" months for each "January", so if both cumulative return series reach similar levels—see panel (b)—it implies much higher average returns in Januaries than in other months.

# January barometer

"The other January effect", or the January barometer, refers to the finding that equity market performance in January has some predictive ability for the next 11 months' returns: "As goes January, so goes the rest of the year." As I mentioned earlier, one intuitive explanation for the first January effect—high returns for risky assets—applies if there is seasonally strong investor risk appetite at the beginning of a new year. The logic for the January barometer follows from the same intuition: if the general risk appetite is already fragile in the benign January environment, it spells trouble for the rest of the year.

The success of the January barometer has been surprisingly consistent across risky assets (as shown in Figure 25.5). This evidence is consistent with an especially strong risk appetite at the beginning of the year, and a bearish view for the rest of the year if investor risk appetite is not healthy in January. Incidentally, this barometer worked very well in 2008 but poorly in 2009.

# Hallowe'en indicator

Equity market returns in the U.S. and many other countries have been high in the half-year between November and April, and low in the half-year between May and October. The Hallowe'en indicator is thus named because a good time to buy risky assets begins near Hallowe'en. Several famous October crashes have occurred just days or weeks before Hallowe'en, which some observers might take as supportive evidence of seasonal sentiment variation, while skeptics might view this as a coincidence or data-mined result.

The evidence is also consistent with the old Wall Street adage, "Sell in May and go away." The period during which the market is not held covers the summer doldrums and the autumn gloom (sometimes linked to seasonal affective disorder, SAD), while the period when the market is held includes the New Year with heightened risk appetite as well as its anticipation.

Figure 25.6 shows that the Hallowe'en effect in equity markets is echoed in the outperformance of small-cap stocks, high-volatility stocks, and long-run reversals as well as credit and carry strategies.

If the bar charts in Figures 25.3, 25.5, and 25.6 resemble each other, there is a reason. The January effect, the January barometer, and the Hallowe'en effect appear related; the patterns are similar and strong for various risky assets and weak for other assets. While other reasons exist, the core story is seasonally high investor risk appetite at the beginning of a new year.

# 25.3 OTHER SEASONALS

While the January seasonal has plausible rational explanations, many other seasonals do not. However, most seasonal patterns are so weak that trading costs prevent exploiting them—except for modifying the timing of planned buying or selling. Moreover, the possibility of data-mined results is evident.

Within-day regularities are only a curiosity for most investors, and any tradable patterns are weak. In equity markets, average returns do not vary significantly across the day but volatility is clearly higher at the beginning and end of the trading day, and, unsurprisingly, at times of major data announcements. In FX markets there is even some evidence of within-day average return variation. Major currencies tend to weaken during the main trading hours of their own time zone—perhaps reflecting diversification flows from local markets into global assets.

The day-of-the week effect was one of the first documented anomalies. In the past, average equity market returns were negative on Mondays. However, this regularity disappeared soon after it became widely known in the 1970s.

Turn of the month. Equity market returns tend to be higher at the turn of the month, both during the week before and after. McConnell-Xu (2008) show that all U.S. equity market excess returns between 1926 and 2005 were earned over a 4-day window (the last business day of the month and the first three business days); average long-run gain on other days was slightly negative. This pattern is not exclusive to the year end, quarter ends, or to the United States. Investors "putting money to work" (i.e., transferring money from the labor market to the capital markets) in a lumpy fashion near the month end seems like an appealing explanation but mutual fund inflows do not show such a regularity.


Holiday effect. Equity market returns tend to be high on the day before major U.S. holidays (as well as on some subsequent days, such as the day after Thanksgiving and after Christmas Day). Similar patterns are found in most other markets, including holidays not on the U.S. calendar (Chinese New Year, Japanese Golden Week).

Grimbacher-Swinkels-Van Vliet (2010) study interactions between the three previous anomalies, the January effect, and the Hallowe'en effect on U.S. equity market returns between 1963 and 2008. They find that the Hallowe'en effect and the turn-of-the-month effect are the strongest, even subsuming the holiday effect. The turn-of-the-month effect looks especially consistent: in each decade between the 1960s and 2000s, annualized average returns on the five business days starting from the last day of the month are 17-37 percentage points higher than on other days.

Lunar cycle. Average equity market returns are higher in the fortnight around the new moon than in the fortnight around the full moon.

Announcement days. It is not surprising that market volatility is higher on days of major economic announcements, and single-stock volatility is higher on earnings announcement days. More surprisingly, average asset returns tend to be higher on those days—perhaps reflecting compensation for uncertainty and gains from the resolution of uncertainty. Finally, many assets exhibit exceptional momentum in the runup to such announcement days (government bonds before payroll data announcement dates and other key economic announcements, stocks before earnings announcements, oil futures before OPEC meetings, and agricultural commodities before major supply and demand reports).

Periodicity. One curious momentum effect in equity markets is 12-month periodicity. Individual stocks tend to outperform or underperform in the same months each year—and these do not necessarily coincide with earnings announcement months.

Supply-demand seasonals. Certain commodity markets exhibit especially strong seasonal patterns. Indeed, such seasonals are often already "in the price". Many agricultural commodity prices tend to be higher before the harvesting period (amidst seasonal scarcity) and lower after the harvest (amidst abundant supply). In the case of heating or cooling energy, it is demand rather than supply that exhibits regular seasonal patterns. Such predictable price variation may provide no exploitable opportunities if it is fully built into futures prices; contract roll losses just offset expected price gains. However, in many cases these patterns are only partly built into futures prices, so seasonal excess returns may be predictable.

Longer cycles. One example is the presidential cycle, in which U.S. equity markets tend to fare better in the last two years than the first two years of presidential terms in office—presumably due to government largesse in the runup to the new election. Like many other documented patterns, this one has partly broken down. The relation between monetary policy cycles and equity market returns has also become weaker since the 1990s. Business cycles remain important and I turn to them next.

# Cyclical variation in asset returns

- Data gathered over business cycles show that, on average, excess returns on risky assets are especially high near cyclical troughs and low near cyclical peaks.
- Forward-looking value indicators (dividend yield, credit spread, curve steepness) tend to decline through expansions and rise through contractions.
- Observing how the growth environment intersects with the inflation or volatility environment gives further insights into asset class behavior. Equity returns have depended on volatility and inflation conditions more than on growth; they excel in disinflationary and stable environments. Bonds have primarily depended on inflation conditions (benefiting from disinflation), while commodities and housing returns have varied most with the growth environment (benefiting from strong growth).

This chapter reviews the way realized returns—and some ex ante carry and value indicators—vary through the business cycle or across different macroeconomic environments. Long data histories are needed for such assessments, which restricts this empirical analysis to core asset classes.

Unlike most of the book, this chapter focuses on contemporaneous empirical relations. The observed relationship between the business cycle and asset returns may be more reflective of unexpected returns (data surprises) than of expected returns. When interpreting the relationship of asset returns to the prevailing macroeconomic environment, we must also keep in mind financial assets' forward-looking nature. Aligning the timing of macroeconomic data series and financial time series is further complicated by the fact that macroeconomic data suffer from publication lags and data revisions (and are measured using noise). Finally, if returns vary predictably over time, it is more useful to study cyclical patterns in ex ante indicators than in realized returns (I document both).

If an investor can predict the economic outlook (not easy!) and if the return regularities documented below are persistent, understanding these relations are essential for a discretionary macro-investor (and indeed are coded in his or her mind). However, the superior macro-investor goes beyond historical regularities and instead asks what is unique in the current situation, how policymaker and investor responses break past patterns, and what relevant structural changes are molding the world. All of which is well beyond the scope of this book.

The evidence in this chapter may also help in understanding rational risk premia or procyclical sentiment, and it may give some clues for market timing, style timing, or factor timing—suggesting good and bad environments for various asset classes and dynamic strategies.

# 26.1 TYPICAL BEHAVIOR OF REALIZED RETURNS AND EX ANTE INDICATORS THROUGH THE BUSINESS CYCLE

Business cycles describe broad fluctuations in aggregate economic activity. The U.S. government considers the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) to be the final arbiter of the U.S. business cycle. Evaluating a variety of economic series, the NBER's Business Cycle Committee officially dates—often after a significant delay—the peaks and troughs of economic activity. (I assume that the last recession ended in July 2009.) The periods between these are called expansions (or recoveries) and contractions (or recessions). Among more journalistic definitions, the most popular is to call two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth a recession. Business cycles in other countries are even more loosely defined. Business cycles are not regular (e.g., recessions became shorter and shallower after World War II). Yet they share common features (e.g., expansions almost always last longer than contractions).

Why do business cycles exist at all? We know that they have existed for millennia—recall the seven fat years and seven lean years in the Old Testament. In an agricultural society, such cycles may have reflected weather and harvest fortunes; in an industrial society, business cycles may be caused by technology shocks or by demand fluctuations, which are often related to changes in credit conditions. The underlying behavioral story is that humans by nature are prone to fits of optimism and pessimism, high and low animal spirits, fear and greed.

Asset returns and valuations turn out to share some of this cyclicality. Arguably, one should not expect large cyclical patterns in the returns of forward-looking, long-lived assets which should "see through" many cycles [1]. Cyclical patterns may thus be more reflective of time variation and wealth dependence in required risk premia than of the market's growth expectations. The monetary policy cycle is a related explanation for financial assets' procyclical behavior. These assets serve as one part of the monetary transmission mechanism when a central bank eases or tightens policy.

Figures 26.1 through 26.4 give a visual perspective to the business cycle pattern in various asset returns and ex ante indicators. I treat each month between January 1927 and December 2009 as being in either the first, second, or last third of each NBER expansion or contraction (recession); in addition, I assign five months around each NBER-defined business cycle turning point to special categories called peak and trough. I then compute the average value of each series within each subperiod. I leave a space between each expansion phase to visually remind the reader that the U.S. economy expanded in  $80\%$  of the 996 months and contracted only  $20\%$  of the time. I display the cyclical trough—a crucial turning point—at both the left and right extremes of the figure.

Figure 26.1 shows that equities perform well in expansions and poorly in the early and middle phases of contractions. However, equities' forward-looking nature and/or countercyclical risk premium are highlighted by the fact that the stock market's realized returns are high around business cycle troughs and low around business cycle peaks. Although this is not visible, the CRP has a cyclical pattern similar to that of the ERP, although an order of magnitude smaller. In addition, the BRP is low near business cycle peaks but realized bond returns are already very high in the middle of the recession.

In Figure 26.2, I turn to other popular equity market factors for which data have been available since 1927. Size exhibits broadly the same cyclical pattern as ERP and CRP.

That is, small-cap stocks tend to outperform near cyclical troughs and early expansions, and underperform near peaks and early contractions. Value exhibits almost no cyclical patterns, except slightly lower returns in mid-contractions and late contractions. However, this pattern mostly reflects the 1930s' experience. Using only postwar data, value works a bit better in contractions than in expansions. Momentum has been a good diversifier near cyclical peaks and in mid-recessions when most risky assets suffer. However, market turnaround in the last third of contractions, and near cyclical troughs, often involves a sharp handover from defensive stocks to aggressive cycicals, which is a bad environment for momentum.

Realized returns are noisy proxies of expected returns. They can be especially misleading whenever realized returns are persistently high (low) because of a gradual fall (rise) in the market's expected or required returns; this is sometimes called the "repricing effect" or "discount rate effect". For example, peak realized excess returns for equities and credits around the business cycle trough hint at high and falling required returns. It is useful to study forward-looking valuation indicators more directly. Figure 26.3 shows that key ex ante indicators of asset risk premia share a similar countercyclical pattern. All three series fall throughout an expansion and rise fast during a contraction, but dividend yield (D/P) and credit spread turn before the cyclical trough. Smoothed earnings yield (not shown) and credit spread (shown) exhibit a pattern similar to D/P. Of the variables, curve steepness (YC) is the best matched to the business cycle in terms of timing. While average dividend yield near cyclical peaks is only slightly lower than that

Finally, Figure 26.4 shows that while the long Treasury yield level exhibits almost no cyclical variation, the short rate and the inflation rate clearly vary with the business cycle. Traditionally, the monetary policy cycle and the business cycle were closely related. As capacity utilization and demand-driven inflation pressures rose in a mature expansion, the central bank responded to overheating by raising short-term rates until it killed the boom. When economic growth became anemic, slack and disinflation ensued, and the central bank could again cut rates to revive the economy.

Most documented cyclical patterns are similar if empirical analysis is started after the Great Depression and World War II instead of 1927. One exception is that postwar inflation rates have been higher in contractions than in expansions (see Figure 17.3). Expected inflation and ex ante real bond yield have not exhibited much cyclicality.

# 26.2 TYPICAL BEHAVIOR OF REALIZED RETURNS AND EX ANTE INDICATORS ACROSS DIFFERENT ECONOMIC REGIMES

Business cycles differ in their depth and duration. The most important contrast is between typical post-World War II recessions, arguably caused by Fed tightening, and balance sheet recessions, caused by de-leveraging after financial excesses (as in the 1930s and 2000s); the latter are more severe.

It is also interesting to observe how the cyclical growth environment intersects with other key drivers of asset returns, such as inflation and volatility. I create three composite dummy series—real growth, inflation, and volatility—and document average realized asset returns and proxies for ex ante returns in relevant data subsets. I assign each calendar quarter to one of the following four growth-and-inflation quadrants (and I do the same for growth and volatility):

<table><tr><td>Disinflationary boom</td><td>Inflationary boom</td></tr><tr><td>Disinflationary stagnation</td><td>Inflationary stagnation</td></tr></table>

There are numerous ways to create and combine such composite series; my approach is by no means unique. The real growth proxy is an equally weighted average of (up to) six normalized series: expected next year real GDP growth, realized past year real GDP growth, real earnings growth, the CFNAI index (a composite of a large number of real activity indicators), the ISM measure of business confidence, and the Conference Board measure of consumer confidence. Two of the six series start only in the mid-1960s. Most negative values coincide with NBER recessions. The inflation proxy reflects both the inflation level and its annual changes (averaging data for headline and core CPI, the GDP deflator, and a consensus forecast inflation rate). The volatility proxy reflects the average of realized stock and bond market volatilities based on daily returns over the past quarter. Figure 26.5 shows the history of the three dummies and indicates in which quadrant the economy is functioning in a given quarter. For example, in early

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-22/aa485235-5155-4ade-b88b-be1df0035d75/9015c9c757174dc58f20111bbae6d69cedfbc3fe50d80cf3bb173beb681b8fc4.jpg)

2009, when both growth and inflation dummies had negative values, the regime was clearly "disinflationary stagnation".

My quadrant classification is simply based on the sign of each dummy. For example, boom and stagnation are periods of fast and slow real activity; stagnation does not imply outright recession. The four quadrants will not be equally populated, due to some asymmetry in each dummy series and to interactions between dimensions (a boom is more often associated with disinflation than with inflation, for example). The first columns in Tables 26.1 and 26.2 show the observed frequency of each quadrant during the 1960-2009 period.

Tables 26.1 and 26.2 show 1960-2009 average real quarterly returns in each growth/inflation quadrant and growth/volatility quadrant. The best (worst) performer in each regime is shown in boldface (italics). There is surprisingly little difference in average returns for risky assets between boom and stagnation regimes. Adding either the inflation or the volatility dimension gives clearer patterns. Indeed, both dimensions discriminate equity returns better than real activity. Equities fare better during disinflationary periods than during inflationary periods. (This finding might not hold up if my study period included the Great Depression.) Equities also fare better during stable market conditions than during volatile episodes. Small-cap stocks and value stocks outperform the equity market in most regimes (based on this classification and sample period), but especially amidst inflation. All bonds fare best in a disinflationary or stable stagnation, while commodities and housing fare best in an inflationary boom.

The volatility dimension is most critical for all types of stocks; equities perform best under stable conditions. The inflation dimension is critical for bonds; they lose under inflationary conditions. The growth dimension is critical for commodities and housing; they excel in any kind of strong-growth environment.

Looking across columns, the stock market outperforms all bonds in most regimes but especially in a disinflationary boom and in the two stable regimes. Bonds mainly outperform stocks in a volatile or disinflationary stagnation, presumably including flight-to-quality and deflationary episodes.

It may be surprising that average real equity market returns are lowest, even negative, during inflationary booms. The counterintuitively poor performance during inflationary booms reflects monetary policy tightening while the counterintuitively strong performance during disinflationary stagnations reflects monetary policy easing. (Average short-rate moves during these quarters were respectively  $+32$  bp and  $-45$  bp, while they averaged about zero for the other two quadrants.) These patterns are just averages: in the last two monetary policy cycles, equities have actually lost money during Fed easing and made money during Fed tightening, perhaps due to recent changes in the timing of Fed policy. Nonetheless, high-frequency data on unexpected Fed moves make it unambiguously clear that the equity market reacts positively to unexpectedly large rate cuts and negatively to rate hikes.


Beyond these exhibits, I also studied the profitability of several strategy styles across these regimes. Highlights from this study reveal that

- Small-cap stocks outperform most in inflationary and/or volatile stagnations and only underperform in disinflationary or volatile booms.
- For equity value strategies, the growth dimension is also critical—but, interestingly, with an opposite sign from small-caps. Value stands out in all boom regimes and only loses money in the stable stagnation regime.
- Equity momentum strategies are profitable in all eight regimes but really shine in inflationary booms. Inflation seems to be the strongest discriminator.
- Trend-following strategies also make money in all eight regimes. They fare best in volatile or inflationary booms and seem to benefit from high growth, high inflation, and high volatility.
- Both the carry composite and the FX carry strategy are profitable in all eight regimes (on average). Both credit carry and FX carry fare better in disinflationary regimes. Credit carry fares best in stable or disinflationary booms, but the evidence for FX carry is mixed.

This type of descriptive analysis is fun but suffers from many limitations. My classification is judgmental as are my regime proxies. Moreover, asset class behavior may vary within each regime (stocks may be more sensitive to growth at the beginning of a boom than at the end) and change over time (bonds' relation to volatility conditions flipped sign after the 1980s). For the results to have investment value, the patterns documented must be reasonably robust and investors need to be able to predict future macroeconomic regimes.

Finally, since realized returns can be misleading proxies of expected returns, we need to study ex ante returns too. Tables 26.3 and 26.4 track the behavior of various ex ante indicators across regimes. This analysis does not show how valuations evolve during each regime, but it reveals that average equity market yields are low during booms and

high during stagnations—especially during inflationary and volatile stagnations. Yield curve steepness mainly depends on inflation conditions and is steepest in disinflationary stagnations. Credit spreads mainly depend on growth conditions and are widest in volatile stagnations. The last columns show that average bond yields and inflation levels were highest in inflationary stagnation regimes, reflecting stagflationary conditions during the two oil crises of the 1970s. As expected, monetary policy easing was most prominent (short rates fell and the yield curve was steep) in disinflationary stagnations.

# 26.3 NOTES

[1] Stock prices discount expected cash flows until perpetuity. The estimated duration of stocks may be longer than 30 years. Such a long period includes several expansions and contractions. Realistically, markets can only have some ability to forecast cash flow growth during the current business cycle, and such near-term cash flows constitute only a small part of a stock's value. The cyclical fluctuations in cash flows beyond the current cycle should largely wash out, leaving a stable anchor for stock prices if markets are rational and discount rates constant.

# Secular trends and the next 20 years

- The analysis of secular trends is inherently discretionary and speculative.
- The period from the 1980s to 2007 was exceptionally benign for many financial assets.
- I highlight several secular trends that may be reversing: free market capitalism, disinflation, rising leverage, financialization, and asset richening.
- I sympathize with consensus views that the coming decade will be characterized by the continued rise of emerging economies and eventual resumption of inflation.

I start this discussion with some numbers, highlighting how exceptional the two decades before 2008 were. Then I identify major secular trends—some of which are now reversing while others are persisting—and review many of them graphically. Finally, I comment on the shadow of the recent crisis and speculate more broadly on the next 20 years.

This chapter is more impressionistic in its analyses and more tied to the current situation than the rest of the book. It has more the style of discretionary view-takers, while the rest of the book tries to learn from history without resorting to subjective market views. In practice, many smart investors want to combine both approaches.

# 27.1 CONTRASTING 1988-2007 WITH 1968-1987

The period 1988-2007 was in many ways a more benign period for financial markets than the preceding two decades, 1968-1987, and probably also more benign than the next two decades. It was a period characterized by increasing globalization and market capitalism as well as disinflation and across-country convergence of inflation rates. (The world 5-year average inflation rate fell from  $13\%$  at the beginning of this period to  $3.8\%$  at the end.) Global growth was solid ( $3.5\%$  annual real GDP growth) but not extraordinary by the high standards of the post-World War II period. Macroeconomic volatility plummeted even though the period was punctuated by several financial crises. There were no major wars between developed countries. In most countries there were no hyperinflations nor deep depressions. Capitalism, democracy, the rule of law, deregulation, and market-friendly economic policies gained ground across the globe over almost the entire period. No wonder market optimism was rife but, as we know, all did not end well.

In contrast, the preceding period involved an increasing role for the state and doubts about capitalism, a shift to fiat currencies, two oil shocks, rising inflation and economic volatility, declining productivity, falling asset valuations, and relatively low realized asset returns. This period of mostly bad news did not last the full 20 years from 1968 to 1987, but essentially came to an end in the summer of 1982 when the massive 1980s' bull market began.


Table 27.1 contrasts the U.S. experience in five areas across the two 20-year periods:

- Macroeconomy. The rate of change in real activity did not differ much across the periods. The earlier period was characterized by rising inflation (until the early 1980s), the latter by disinflation. The volatility of both real activity and inflation series fell dramatically between the two periods (this change is sometimes called the Great Moderation).
- Debt growth outpaced economic growth in all sectors, and at a faster rate in the second 20 years than in the first; but the sharp rise in public indebtedness occurred after 2007. Leverage of the financial sector rose very fast, from  $9\%$  of GDP in 1967 to  $39\%$  in 1987 and to  $115\%$  in 2007. The household sector was not far behind in its leveraging.
- "Financialization" was a major trend in the 1988-2007 period. Corporate profits rose faster than GDP, equity market capitalization rose faster than profits, and financial companies' share of both profits and market cap grew rapidly. This was a sharp reversal because all these ratios had shrunk during the 1968-1987 period.
- Financial assets performed relatively poorly in the earlier period and very well in the latter period. Average real returns were clearly higher between 1988 and 2007, while return volatility was lower. Another benign feature was that the correlation between equity markets and Treasuries shifted from positive  $(+0.4)$  to negative  $(-0.1)$ , thereby enhancing diversification of balanced stock-bond portfolios. Not surprisingly, real assets such as real estate and commodities outpaced financial assets in the inflationary 1970s but lagged subsequently (not shown).
- High asset returns between 1988 and 2007 partly reflected rising asset valuations. Real and nominal Treasury yields fell by more than half amid falling inflation expectations and a fall in inflation-related risk premia, and the equity market saw significant multiple expansion. In contrast, all asset valuations had deteriorated during the preceding two decades.

# 27.2 REVERSIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE SECULAR TRENDS

Here is a list of 10 secular trends that drove markets in recent decades. I deem half of these trends to be reversing. Of course, it is just a judgment whether any trend is reversing or not, but my views seem close to the consensus.

# Trends that appear to be reversing:

- free market capitalism; disinflation;
- rising leverage;
- financialization;

For symmetry, here are five trends that appear sustainable:

- technological progress;
- the "rise of the rest" (China, the rest of Asia, and other emerging economies); aging population;
- globalization; and
- environmental concerns (climate change, limited natural resources, socially responsible investing [1]).

These are all huge topics, and beyond the scope of this book. I turn to a couple of these themes in the next section but for now I focus on reversing trends. I simply remind the reader that all such secular trends, if persistent, create potential landmines for backward-looking mean reversion or fair value models (see Section 12.5).

# Shifting pendulum between markets and state

It is hardest to quantify this trend, but it is clear that the decades since the early 1980s witnessed globally spreading capitalism. Many centrally planned economies turned into market economies and even China embraced economic liberalism while nominally remaining a communist state. Deregulation, liberalization of cross-border flows, and falling top (and other) tax rates were other prevalent trends.

The pendulum is shifting back. A backlash against laissez-faire capitalism is understandable after financial market excesses and turbulence caused the worst global recession in decades in 2008. While the reasons for this crisis can be debated, the consensus view blames free market ideology as much as greedy bankers, reckless home buyers, or misguided government policy. More regulation will certainly follow. Stretched public finances also make higher taxes inevitable down the road. Markets are giving way to the state.

# Disinflation and the Great Moderation

I discuss inflation developments in greater detail in Chapter 17. Here I just remind readers of the mountain shape in postwar U.S. inflation data: an uptrend in the 1960s and 1970s and a downtrend in the 1980s and 1990s (see Figure 27.1). Importantly, many real-economy series and asset return series seem to have shared—or, rather, mirrored—these trends. Many benign developments—lower volatility, stronger real economy and corporate performance, and higher asset valuations—since the early 1980s may be traced back to disinflation, just as many of the malign developments before that may be attributed to soaring inflation and nominal interest rates.

Disinflation since 1980 coincided with a decline in macroeconomic volatility (the Great Moderation) and, to a much lesser extent, in financial market volatility (see Figure 27.2). Here, too, a reversal seems to be taking place, as macro-volatility spiked in 2008, together with financial market volatility.

# Leveraging

American households de-levered for 20 years after the Great Depression, but then began to re-lever, producing an inexorable rise in the debt/GDP ratio (see Figure 27.3). The

By some measures, the U.S. private savings rate turned negative by the mid-2000s. The corporate sector also borrowed more, but the most dramatic leveraging occurred in the financial sector. Here, too, the pendulum was shifting and the turn in the private debt/GDP ratio in 2008–2009 was likely only the beginning of a longer balance sheet healing process. Aggressive public-sector borrowing is partly offsetting private-sector de-leveraging.

One critical view blames rising financial leverage on repeated bailouts in recent decades. According to the "debt supercycle" theme of the Bank Credit Analyst, the borrow-and-spend process has been a means to sustain politically desirable economic growth. In the background lurked policymakers' fear of another Great Depression, but by keeping deflationary risks contained they created new types of imbalances: ever escalating leverage punctuated by occasional crises, and bailouts that encouraged ever greater risk taking and moral hazard. We may be in the final innings of this supercycle since 2008: the private sector no longer keeps borrowing while the public sector levers up to sustain economic growth. Eventually, stretched public finances will threaten public-sector credibility to the extent that such reflation policy will not be able to continue.

# Financialization

Financialization refers to the growing role of the financial industry in the economy. The financial sector's share of corporate profits ranged between  $10\%$  and  $20\%$  from the 1950s to the 1980s. The share began to rise in the mid-1980s and stayed between  $30\%$  and  $45\%$  in 2001–2007. As a result, financial companies' share of total equity market capitalization doubled from  $13\%$  to  $26\%$  between 1988 and 2006. These unsustainable developments reversed sharply in 2008 (see Figure 27.4).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-11-22/aa485235-5155-4ade-b88b-be1df0035d75/9d3174f9349d8f4494f2ebac9e93b36f371f7c49266d567b6550b9ec3f90548c.jpg)

Financialization is related to several other trends: rising leverage and asset richening; securitization and its flip side (i.e., disintermediation from banks); deregulation and active financial innovations; expansion of the delegated asset management industry (institutionalization of asset holding and trading); the finance sector's increasing political influence; widening income inequality within countries; and globalization and integration of capital markets. Some of these trends are now reversing. For example, certain securitized asset classes have not recovered their liquidity since both the 2008 crisis and the "flight to simplicity". Other trends, such as growth of the asset management industry, will persist.

# Assetrichening

The quarter-century of free markets, disinflation, and financialization coincided with a general decline in real yields and increase in the valuations of all asset classes.

Since World War II, the share of GDP represented by corporate profits has been mean-reverting in the  $6\%$  to  $12\%$  range. It peaked in 1955, 1966, and 2006 and troughed in 1982—not coincidentally near the peak of inflation. However, the inflationary 1970s were characterized less by the low absolute level of corporate profits and more by the conservative capitalization of these profits. The market-cap-to-profits ratio (a variant of the P/E ratio) troughed at 4 in 1978 and peaked at 20 in 2000. The equity market cap of the U.S. amounted to less than half of the country's annual GDP between 1975 and 1985, but exceeded GDP every year between 1996 and 2007. (Note that the market cap/GDP ratio mixes two effects, market valuation and financialization, the latter in this case being a descriptor for the proportion of total business wealth that is publicly traded.) Equity markets capitalized current production and profits especially aggressively during the tech bubble and less ambitiously in the mid-2000s (see Figure 27.5).

# 27.3 THE NEXT 20 YEARS

# The shadow of the crisis

Many of the trends listed above contributed to the 2007-2008 financial crisis; and their reversals are, in part, consequences of the crisis. In this spirit, PIMCO's Bill Gross and Mohamed El-Erian characterize the post-crisis years as the "new normal" environment of slower economic growth and greater government involvement, in which deleveraging, de-globalization, and re-regulation are key features.

Like many others, I expected the crisis to have a long-lasting impact on this generation's risk appetite—echoing that of the conservative "depression babies"—but the sharp risky asset rally in 2009 and early 2010 suggests that the lessons were not very memorable. The mother of all stimulus efforts succeeded in reviving animal spirits in 2009. Asset reflation was the key policy for pulling the economy back from the edge of the precipice. Major contributors were record-low short-term interest rates set by Fed policy; "quantitative easing"; bailouts, guarantees, and support programs; and fiscal expansion. This reflation policy may have worked too well to bolster financial markets but insufficiently to support job markets—the collateral damage to public-sector finances has been substantial.

# Box 27.1. Thoughts on the origins of the financial crisis

The big picture is that the crisis followed the broad underpricing of risk in several asset classes amid persistently loose financial conditions. Recall Alan Greenspan's warning during the boom years: "History has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premia."

A related interpretation is that the crisis was a modern-day bank run, where a bank run is defined as loss of confidence in a given bank, an asset class, or even the whole financial system. There was arguably too much trust and confidence during the preceding years, leading to complacency and excessive risk taking. Modern financial markets rely on liquidity. Once trust and confidence vanished, so did market liquidity in several assets. Lawrence Summers said in the midst of the crisis: "We got here because there was too much greed and too little fear. We are stuck here now because there is too much fear and too little greed."

Taking an even broader perspective, the latest boom-bust cycle is only one part of the story, the cyclical part. The other, secular, part is the decades-long rise in indebtedness. I already alluded to the debt supercycle; George Soros emphasizes another secular theme, decades of deregulation and market fundamentalism. Yet others stress the paradox of credibility: central bankers' apparent success in taming inflation and the business cycle made investors overconfident of the persistence of the Goldilocks environment, resulting in unsustainable increases in credit growth and asset valuations.

Details make up the rest. There is plenty of blame to go around. Whether most of the blame is assigned to market participants and markets or to politicians, regulators, and monetary policymakers apparently depends more on values than on facts.

I finish this chapter with a few other speculative views—given in what I hope is a very humble tone.

# Unexciting prospects for risky assets

First, I see only moderate returns from risky assets over the medium term. Growth prospects are not promising, given the pendulum shift against free markets and the still stretched private and public balance sheets. Starting yields are historically low. Risky asset valuations are unlikely to improve on a sustained basis, thanks to wealth-dependent risk aversion and lingering memories of the crisis, higher macroeconomic volatility, less trust all around, and less benign inflation prospects for risky assets.

# Relative rise of China and emerging markets

El-Erian (2008) makes a convincing case for a secular handoff of economic power from developed countries to emerging countries, especially from the U.S. to China. Economic growth in Asia ex-Japan is faster and the demographic profile much better than in the

G7 countries. Asian countries have been capital exporters despite their strong growth; even if their economies gradually become more consumer oriented, they are becoming the owners of global capital. By many measures, the economic fundamentals of emerging countries already surpass those of developed countries, and emerging market economic policies have improved dramatically. In contrast, the G7 countries suffered more from the financial crisis, and their aging workforce makes their future almost inevitably bleaker. Current fiscal fundamentals are already better for emerging economies, and the IMF predicts that the gap between the debt/GDP ratios of advanced economies and emerging economies will widen in the coming years, even before the demographic challenge really hits the former.

These favorable structural developments have helped emerging market equities outperform developed market equities for several years. It is also conceivable that an emerging market (or China-specific) bubble will ensue as the secular handoff story garners more followers and as the loose monetary policy that is tailored for the needs of the weak developed economies is exported to the strong emerging economies. As always, the bubble would have a rational precipitating factor, but investors should remember that the link between economic growth and equity market returns is quite tenuous (see Chapter 16).

# The Scylla and Charybdis of deflation and inflation

The disinflationary tailwinds of recent decades—from improvements in central bank independence and credibility as well as from deregulation, globalization, and the massive entry of Chinese workers into the competitive global labor market—may weaken and even turn into headwinds. Moreover, the solutions to some of the major challenges of the 21st century—global warming and the aging population of many countries—are arguably inflationary.

In the shorter term, the financial crisis and the 2008-2009 recession, as well as the subsequent need for belt tightening, are deflationary in their impact. It is hard to see inflation rising in the next year or two, given the elevated unemployment rate and economic slack. Yet, higher inflation down the road is a serious concern and is perhaps made even more likely by any near-term deflation:

- Rising public deficits due to the recession and slow recovery mean that current fiscal challenges will meld into the eventual huge fiscal costs associated with baby-boomers' pensions and health care, with no time for recovery or adjustment. Higher taxes would choke off economic recovery, and suddenly cutting benefits would be painful when people have not had enough time to prepare by saving more privately. Increasing retirement ages will certainly be part of the solution, with the added benefit that in a "knowledge society" older people can be more productive, in contrast to muscle-based pre-industrial societies (idea from Laurence Siegel).
- The central bank is the backstop that can resist or accommodate inflationary pressures. Improved central bank credibility was one major reason for anchoring long-term inflation expectations. We simply do not know what it takes to unmoor those expectations, what it takes to get the genie back in the bottle if this happens, and if the Fed has the stomach for it. Bond vigilantes worry about the Fed's priorities and its independence.

Even if the unmooring of inflation expectations to the upside is scary, the impact of global deflation, if it occurs, is even worse. Debt deflation and hyperinflation are the worst destroyers of wealth. Most policymakers now fear the former more than the latter, which makes inflation (though not hyperinflation) the more likely medium-term outcome.

# Sovereign creditworthiness may be reassessed

Consistent with both themes discussed above, re-rating of perceived creditworthiness may take place. Given the rising fiscal challenges in G7 markets, we could see G7 government bond yields rise above those of top-rated emerging nations and top-rated corporations. Advanced countries do benefit from their record of very rare sovereign defaults—although Reinhart-Rogoff (2008, 2009) show that sovereign defaults have been surprisingly frequent in a longer view of history—especially at times of global inflation pressures (see Figure 27.6). In Reinhart-Rogoff (2010), the authors add that the history of the global public debt/GDP ratio shares similar contours with both lines: peaks in 1932 and 1990 (the 2010 level challenging these peaks) and troughs before World War I, the first oil shock (1973), and the latest financial crisis. Given a hard choice, many countries might opt to resort to the printing press (inflation) before defaulting on their external debt, because the latter action normally carries heavier economic penalties. However, within the EMU, the debt monetization option is precluded for individual countries.

The long-term fiscal challenge from demographics easily overwhelms the problems caused by the financial crisis and recession. Yet, government bond yields remain historically low—aided by near-zero short-term interest rates, central bank purchases, safe haven demand, and a still low inflation risk premium. Some quip that the riskless return in Treasuries has morphed into a returnless risk. After a quarter-century when bearing duration risk was amply rewarded, Treasuries may provide neither safety nor performance in the coming decade.

Finally, the last innings of the debt supercycle may arrive even before the demographic costs balloon. Market participants are turning their focus on the magnitude of the fiscal problem just when G7 economies face extraordinary borrowing needs and sharply rising debt/GDP ratios. Figure 27.7 shows how dramatically sovereign credit spreads have widened, especially in countries with more urgent debt troubles. Before 2008 these spreads were razor thin with little differentiation across countries. If, in the future, the market assigns larger required risk premia to highly indebted countries, their real yields will rise and/or their currencies may falter. Major central banks would then face tougher choices between inflation and real economic growth than they have for a generation.

# 27.4 NOTES

[1] Abstracting from important ethical issues and focusing only on financial returns, empirical evidence on the benefits of socially responsible investing (SRI) has been mixed. Derwall-Koedijk-Ter Horst (2010) argue that this ambiguity reflects, on the one hand, the high returns of controversial stocks ("sin stocks") that are negatively screened away from many SRI portfolios and, on the other hand, the high returns of stocks identified and overweighted by positive screens involving environmental and social issues.

# Enhancing returns through managing risks, horizon, skill, and costs

- This chapter reviews four paths for improving portfolio performance and drills into each of them.
- Risks. The simple way to boost long-run returns is to raise the weight of riskier assets in the portfolio. The more complex but better rewarding approach requires leverage. Within each asset class, buying the riskiest assets almost invariably gives worse long-run returns than levering up lower volatility assets. Even across asset classes, investors can reduce portfolio volatility by smart diversification and then convert improved risk-adjusted returns into higher raw returns by applying moderate leverage.
- Horizon. Investors with a long time horizon can exploit it by over-allocating to illiquid asset classes and reaping related illiquidity premia. Other possibilities include contrarian market timing and opportunistic reinsurance underwriting.
- Skill. Active investors may try to add value through skillful security selection and market timing, either in house or externally. Even when markets are not fully efficient, they are competitive enough to make the task challenging. Building an active management culture and resources internally is not easy, nor is it easy to identify consistent outperformers among external managers.
- Costs. Reducing fees and other implementation costs is often the easiest way to enhance net returns. It is harder to decide on the allocation between (cheap, abundant) beta products and (costly, scarce) alpha, because the higher fees and trading costs in actively managed investments are sometimes worth it. Relative weights should depend on investor views regarding market efficiency and one's own skills at active investing or manager selection.
- After an overview, this chapter drills into each path and also contains essays on related topics such as rebalancing and diversification return, looking beyond the Sharpe ratio, and time diversification.

# 28.1 INTRODUCTION: HOW CAN INVESTORS ENHANCE RETURNS?

It is time to start drawing the investment lessons from the preceding 27 chapters. Chapters 28 and 29 summarize my thinking on how investors can add value. This book's focus is on harvesting various (beta) risk premia, but I also review here debates about skill-based management (alpha seeking). This chapter also drills into certain ways of improving investment performance that go beyond the expected returns of particular investments.


Investors can pursue four paths to improve portfolio performance: managing risks, horizon, skill, and costs. The boundaries between the four paths are admittedly ambiguous and certain activities could be classified under at least two paths. This subsection gives a bird's eye view on each path before turning to more detailed treatments in Sections 28.2-28.5.

This book is primarily about the long-term expected returns of certain asset classes and investment strategies—not about risk management or portfolio construction. However, it turns out that smart diversification can indirectly boost portfolio returns as well as reduce risk.

# 28.1.1 Risks: Bearing more risk and monetizing risk reduction

Paradoxically, expected portfolio returns can be augmented by either increasing or reducing the weight of the most volatile asset class. The classic naive approach is to raise the weight of "high-risk, high-return" equities and reduce the weight of "low-risk, low-return" assets such as cash and government bonds. Bearing more risk in this way, and getting rewarded for it, is indeed the easiest way to boost long-run returns for investors who cannot use leverage. Those who can lever have an arguably better alternative: instead of taking more risk they can take better quality risk. They can reduce portfolio risk through smarter diversification and then "monetize" (capitalize on) the volatility reduction benefit by scaling up position sizes to reach the original volatility level.

Section 28.2.1 reviews one way investors can use better diversification to remedy the classic problem with institutional portfolios, namely concentrated equity market risk. Portfolio rebalancing, volatility targeting, and smart diversification are other ways to reduce portfolio risk and improve risk-adjusted returns (see Sections 28.2.2-28.2.4).

# 28.1.2 Exploiting a long horizon

Investors with a long horizon do not need short-term liquidity. If the market rewards illiquid assets with an illiquidity premium, it makes sense that long-horizon investors over-allocate to such assets. These include private equity and other alternative asset classes as well as certain pockets of traditional asset classes (small-cap stocks, corporate bonds). However, it is folly to expect illiquidity premia to be constant over time or to be realized when extra money happens to be needed. Many investors raised their allocations to illiquid asset classes in 2005–2007 just when their valuations were high and prospective premia negligible.

More generally, long-horizon investors should be better able to take advantage of time-varying expected returns by contrarian market timing. The combination of a long horizon and deep pockets gives some large sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) a natural edge in being the liquidity provider within major asset classes when assets are distressed. These investors could also follow Warren Buffett into some unconventional strategies where patience and deep pockets help. Examples: Opportunistic entries into reinsurance underwriting after recent catastrophes have made reinsurance capital scarce and boosted the prospective rewards for underwriting. The capital infusions many SWFs made into financial institutions in 2007-2008 were in similar spirit, albeit implemented too early.


It is best to be conservative in assessing one's horizon length. Institutional and individual horizons tend to get shorter during financial turmoil, due to true acute cash flow needs or to psychological factors. In preceding years, "true" long-horizon investors had to compete with many "long-horizon wannabes", a situation that pushed ex ante liquidity premia to negligible levels. During the crisis these premia shot up, which to a rational investor is an indicator to hold on to their investments and maybe even exploit new buying opportunities. Yet even some endowments and pension plans—the prototypical long-term investors—felt obliged (or were obliged by cash flow requirements) to sell illiquid holdings into unreceptive markets.

Investors increasingly appreciate the cost of illiquidity (and the risk in assets whose losses covary with deteriorating aggregate liquidity conditions). It is becoming more common to design contracts with external managers in which the end-investor gets appropriately compensated for lockups and other undesirable terms and accepts higher fees for easy liquidity terms. However, the contracted liquidity terms should be realistic, or managers may honor end-investor redemption calls by selling assets at fire-sale prices.

# 28.1.3 Benefiting from skill

Active investors can try to add value through skillful security selection and market timing, sector timing, or style timing. Active investing may be done internally or externally, neither of which is easy in competitive financial markets. Developing sufficient skill in house and maintaining the talent is a major challenge, but so is identifying consistent alpha producers among external managers.

One key distinction is between discretionary and systematic styles. Discretionary managers tend to focus on specific companies, industries, or other individual securities (say, commodity futures) and are usually specialists. Systematic managers emphasize value-added through broad diversification (applying key ideas such as value and momentum in many markets), smart portfolio construction and risk management, and cost-effective implementation. These activities also require skill, but according to some definitions only discretionary managers can provide pure alpha; anything that can be written down is, at best, alternative beta.

Skill-based investing is increasingly associated with HFs. The idea is that alpha is best reaped by well-motivated unconstrained managers using some combination of leverage, long-short investing, and derivatives. Yet, to beat high-fee structures, you need some expertise or luck to pick top-half managers. Success at HF selection is made more plausible because alternative managers exhibit wider performance dispersion as well as greater performance persistence and predictability than traditional managers.

A common view is that skill is best applied in illiquid asset classes and in market segments where mispricings are harder to arbitrage and thus they survive longer. A counterview is that it is easier to identify skill vs. luck in liquid assets with frequent performance measurement. With illiquid assets, effective sample sizes will be tiny. Moreover, if you reassess a manager's skill over time, there will be times (say in 2008) when you may want to get out but you have no flexibility to do so.

# 28.1.4 Cost control

Passive investing minimizes trading costs. However, some costs are worth paying. Buying an equity index fund costs more than investing in a bank deposit, but the equity premium should make the extra cost worthwhile in the long run. Value-oriented non-market-cap weighting involves higher turnover and fees than market cap indices, but proponents of fundamental indexation argue that long-run net returns will be better. Beta products are cheap, while scarcity makes alpha costly; yet it does not automatically follow that alpha allocations should be avoided.

Minimizing costs is not always smart; being cost-effective and avoiding wasteful expense is.

In assessing tradeoffs, such as the relative weights of active and passive (alpha and beta) products, reasonable answers vary across investors. Clearly, a retail investor with high trading costs and few natural edges is almost always better off with low-cost beta products. In contrast, a resource-rich institution with low trading costs has a better chance at succeeding in active management. (A caveat: Large investors often suffer from higher market impact costs.)

In general, investors should allocate more to alpha products the less they believe in market efficiency and the more they believe in their own skills (in active investing or manager selection). Skepticism is healthy. It should be remembered that most active long-only managers underperform their benchmarks after fees and that retail investors fare even worse. The record of HF managers, as a group, looks better but it is hard to fully adjust for the impact of voluntary reporting biases and various risks. To end ahead after fees, you must be able to identify the better managers, which is a challenge.

Alternative managers charge pricey fees, especially if they can boast a good track record. However, trying to beat the markets in-house "on the cheap"—with poorly resourced and incentivized internal managers—may be even more costly. To be cost-effective, some end-investors go for an alpha-beta barbell (combining HFs and passive market indices), while others try to save costs by buying into alternative beta products rather than actual HFs.

Investors should look beyond visible costs even with passive strategies: if there is no cost advantage in staple indices, you should favor customized benchmarks to avoid synchronous portfolio adjustments with big index players. For example, the S&P 500 index loses  $20\mathrm{bp}$  to  $30\mathrm{bp}$  each year due to the market impact of concentrated buying and selling around index additions and deletions. Meanwhile, the way that S&P GSCI Commodity index owners synchronously roll into new futures contracts each month causes a predictable temporary supply-demand imbalance that hurts these index investors.

# 28.2 RISK

This book does not cover the important topics of risk management and portfolio construction except for their mechanical impact on expected returns. Risk reduction through diversification is famously the one free lunch that markets offer, but it improves risk-adjusted returns rather than raw returns. However, Sections 28.2.1 and 28.2.2 show how diversification can boost portfolio returns, almost magically, through leverage or rebalancing. The more typical approach to boosting expected returns is to take more risk, but I remind the reader that not all risks are rewarded and certainly they are not all rewarded equally well. Section 28.2.3 stresses that markets do not treat all volatility as equal, a theme closely related to the shortcomings of the Sharpe ratio, the most common measure of risk-adjusted returns. Section 28.2.4 briefly reviews smart diversification or portfolio construction methods for efficient risk reduction.


# 28.2.1 Monetized risk reduction via leverage

Many retail investor portfolios are insufficiently diversified, perhaps consisting of only a few stocks and having plenty of diversifiable, unrewarded risk. It turns out that typical institutional portfolios are also poorly diversified, but not from holding too small a number of stocks; the reason is that a 60/40 nominal stock/bond allocation implies over  $95\%$  of the risk budget (portfolio volatility) coming from the equity component. Such concentrated risk taking is inefficient; a more balanced risk budget would give higher risk-adjusted returns. One way to improve the portfolio's SR is to lever up the bond component to a volatility level similar to that of the equity component. This approach is often called risk parity investing.

Table 28.1 shows that an equal volatility stock/bond portfolio (i.e., 50/50 volatility weights for stocks and bonds) has a tad higher Sharpe ratio (0.40 vs. 0.38) and a clearly lower correlation with the equity market (0.76 vs. 0.96) than an equal nominal weight stock/bond portfolio. All position sizes can be scaled up or down to reach any desired portfolio volatility target. Investors who accept more leverage can select a higher return for equity-type volatility (the last column in the table) instead of lower volatility for an equity-type expected return. Empirical results are similar whether I use "in-sample" or (trailing) "out-of-sample" volatilities.

The Sharpe ratio improvement in this example is not too compelling, partly because the stock-bond correlation was still positive over this 40-year window. Gains from risk parity investing would rise with a lower stock-bond correlation, lower relative volatility between bonds and stocks, and a higher relative Sharpe ratio between them. Broadening

into several moderately correlated asset classes would improve diversification and the portfolio's SR faster, even if the generally high correlations of most assets with equities limit the benefits.

Leverage can be used to monetize any increase in the portfolio SR. Leverage is needed for two reasons: offsetting the shift into a lower volatility asset and converting the higher portfolio SR into a higher portfolio return:

- Investors who do not seek high raw returns do not need leverage. They benefit directly from better risk-adjusted returns (lower return but much lower volatility).
- Many relatively risk-tolerant long-horizon investors want high returns; yet they may dislike leverage even more than portfolio volatility. When faced with a choice between (1) boosting portfolio returns through leverage and (2) holding concentrated unlevered positions in the most volatile asset class or classes, they may select the latter even if the resulting expected portfolio return is lower.
- One reason for HFs' ability to outperform long-only investors is their capacity and willingness to lever up many small standalone opportunities. Admittedly, leveraged positions come with a greater likelihood of having to de-lever in bad times at fire sale prices.
- More generally, if you monetize diversification gains via leverage, and diversification fails in bad times—recall the correlation spikes in 1998 and 2008—a broadly diversified portfolio can experience sharper losses than a simple equity-concentrated portfolio.

What has been the impact of leverage aversion and leverage constraints on asset returns in the past?

- Return-seeking institutions that face leverage constraints may overpay for asset classes that provide embedded leverage (private equity, hedge funds, structured products) so that they get maximal bang for the buck for their unlevered positions.
- Such return seeking, combined with leverage constraints, has helped make the most volatile assets in each asset class systematically overpriced. That is, the long-run reward for volatility often has a counterintuitive negative sign within asset classes. High-volatility and highly levered stocks have especially low returns; duration extension has paid much better at the front end than at the back end of the curve; in credit markets, low-rated (Caa/CCC and below) high-yield bonds have delivered the worst long-run performance of all rating buckets; and shifting from Treasuries to credits gives consistent rewards only at short maturities. Investors free to apply leverage would get better long-run results in all the above cases by scaling up the opportunities in low-volatility assets (although funding spreads would eat up some of the benefits).
- Avoiding overpriced high-volatility assets gives a second edge to the "levering short-volatility assets" approach. Even without overpricing, merely achieving superior diversification gives this approach an edge.

Leverage has now a worse reputation than before 2007-2008 because it is widely blamed for the crisis. At the very least, the leverage of banks will soon be more tightly restricted by new regulations. The practical impact will be more pronounced risk premia for low-volatility assets, more sustained mispricings among them, and greater opportunities for those who can still apply leverage.

# 28.2.2 Rebalancing and "diversification return"

Rebalancing asset classes toward target weights is a common risk control approach. Somewhat miraculously, under relatively undemanding assumptions (but not in all possible scenarios), rebalancing also boosts a portfolio's long-run compound return. In most cases this effect is quite mild, but it is interesting that this return enhancement does not require leverage.

Market moves can make asset class weights drift from their target weights—say, a 60/40 stock/bond allocation. Rebalancing refers to trading activity that counters such a drift. It involves buying asset classes that recently underperformed and selling recent outperformers. Rebalancing may be calendar based or trigger based, and a rebalancing rule may push asset weights all the way back to the target or only to the edge of a "no-trading band".

It makes intuitive sense that rebalancing is profitable if asset class returns are mean-reverting (at frequencies well synchronized with rebalancing activity). More surprisingly, rebalancing turns out to boost long-run compound returns even if asset returns exhibit no mean reversion tendency. My analysis is mainly based on three papers: Booth-Fama (1992), Bernstein-Wilkinson (1997), and Erb-Harvey (2006).

Here are the key ideas behind how this gain arises in a world with zero-autocorrelated returns (neither mean reversion nor momentum bias in returns, and asset prices follow a random walk):

- The technical reason can be traced to a distinction between arithmetic and geometric means. An asset's or a portfolio's geometric mean (GM) (i.e., its compound return) depends both on its arithmetic mean (AM) and its variance. Higher volatility erodes compound returns and thus wealth accumulation over time.
- Diversification reduces a portfolio's variance and thus boosts its GM, given constant AMs. Diversification return (DR) is the excess of a portfolio's GM over its constituents' weighted average GM.
- Rebalancing to constant weights is needed to earn the DR. Rebalancing ensures diversification—by not letting one asset class grow to dominate the portfolio.

# Box 28.1. Arithmetic and geometric means

As noted in Section 4.3, the arithmetic mean of a series is always higher than the geometric mean (AM > GM) except when there is zero volatility (AM = GM). A simple Taylor series expansion shows that a good approximation is:  $\mathrm{GM} \approx \mathrm{AM} - \mathrm{Variance}/2$ .

There has been an ongoing debate in financial circles for decades as to which measure is more appropriate for assessing long-term expected returns and terminal wealth. Textbooks have traditionally sided with AM, while practitioners often prefer GM, perhaps because the latter is correct for measuring realized compound return.

The AM-GM distinction is related to the difference between mean and median. Long-horizon cumulative asset returns are highly skewed: expected returns are unbounded from above—asset prices can rise hundreds of percent or more—but have a bounded downside as they can "only" lose  $-100\%$ . Due to positive skew- ness caused by a few extremely positive outcomes, the mathematical expected return (AM) can be a very atypical outcome. While AMs overstate the long-run future return investors are likely to realize, GMs are more like medians that give more realistic forecasts for long-horizon investors. In the presence of estimation errors, an unbiased estimate of future portfolio value depends more on the GM the longer the time horizon (for a given historical sample length).


The  $GM \approx AM -$  Half the variance approximation holds for a single asset and for a portfolio, including a market index. For example, if equities have a long-run annualized volatility of  $20\%$ , variance is  $20\%^2 = 4\%$ . Thus, the expected variance drain (the gap between AM and GM) is  $2\%$ . (Actual data on the annual returns of U.S. large-cap stocks between 1926 and 2006 agree: the AM was  $12.3\%$ , GM  $10.4\%$ , and volatility  $20\%$ .) For bond indices with annual return volatility of  $6\%$  to  $7\%$ , the variance drain is only about  $0.2\%$ .

Because the geometric mean reflects both the arithmetic mean and variance, some academics and practitioners have long recommended the multi-period strategy of maximizing the portfolio's expected compound return as an alternative to mean variance optimization.

# "Turning water into wine"

Here is an example of diversification return from Erb-Harvey (2006): an annually rebalanced portfolio consisting of  $50\%$  heating oil and  $50\%$  stocks had an excess return (GM) of  $11.0\%$  over a decade, much higher than either component. Heating oil had an excess return (GM) of  $8.2\%$  but an AM near  $18\%$ . Stocks had an excess return (GM) of  $6.8\%$  but an AM near  $9\%$ . Diversification return was about  $3.5\%$ , thanks to variance reduction.

# Diversification reduces the variance drain and thereby boosts portfolio geometric means

A portfolio's return equals the (weighted) average AM return of its constituents whereas variances are not additive unless constituents are perfectly correlated. Diversification is the rare free lunch available for all investors: we can reduce portfolio volatility without reducing its AM. This volatility reduction improves the portfolio's GM by reducing its variance drain. It follows that the GM of a portfolio exceeds the average GM of its constituents. The difference is the DR. That is, investors can raise their portfolio GM by identifying a new investment that is uncorrelated with the original portfolio and has comparable return. This gain (DR) is proportional to half the new asset's variance. I stress that diversification boosts the GM but not the AM. Yet, since diversification reduces volatility, investors who can lever up their portfolio back to the original volatility level can also enhance their AM.

# Importance of rebalancing

In practice, earning the DR requires rebalancing to some constant weights (not necessarily equal). Rebalancing reduces the weights of outperforming assets. If asset weights are allowed to drift significantly over time, the most successful assets over long samples may come to dominate portfolio weights and dilute any diversification effects.

Erb and Harvey stress that the DR really reflects two features: the variance drain and rebalancing. They give the label "covariance drag" to the negative impact on GM of not rebalancing; by definition, this drag is zero for continuously rebalanced strategies. In practice, unrebalanced strategies (with "let-it-run" weights following some initial weighting) often have a near-zero DR. The variance reduction benefit and covariance drag roughly offset each other, thereby making the portfolio GM roughly equal to the constituents' average GM. This is also true for a market-weighted portfolio, which is just one example of an unrebalanced strategy.

# Factors that drive diversification return

The DR is especially large for portfolios with high asset volatility and low correlations. Because the constituents of typical equity portfolios (or bond portfolios) tend to be relatively highly correlated, their DR is modest. Moreover, since typical equity and bond portfolios are rarely rebalanced to constant weights, their covariance drag likely offsets the variance drain effect. When rebalancing asset allocation weights between equity and bond portfolios (and other asset classes), the DR should be higher, given the low correlations between asset classes.

As a good approximation, expected equally weighted rebalanced portfolio DR (1) rises with the number of assets in the portfolio, (2) is proportional to average variance, and (3) is negatively proportional to the average correlation among portfolio constituents.

# Extension 1 Relatively similar long-run expected returns across assets favor rebalancing

The analysis of Bernstein-Wilkinson (1997) is more general than that of Erb and Harvey and highlights the role of expected return differences across assets better. First, the intuition: If assets in the portfolio have persistently different expected returns, rebalancing involves gradual selling of high-return assets. A no-rebalancing strategy would let the highest return asset eventually grow to constitute the entire portfolio and thus make the portfolio's expected return equal the highest returning asset's expected return. Given sufficiently large expected return differences across assets, the benefit from this effect must exceed any diversification benefit maintained via rebalancing.

This study shows that the GM gap between rebalanced and unrebalanced portfolios can be proxied by two terms:

- the first term favors the unrebalanced portfolio; it is large when GMs are highly dispersed across assets and is zero when all assets have equal GMs—in line with the Bernstein-Wilkinson generalization;
- the second term favors the rebalanced portfolio; it is large when individual assets have large variances and low/negative correlations—in line with Erb and Harvey's analysis.

Empirical exercises suggest that the latter term dominates. Only when GM differences are very wide (say, rebalancing between low-yielding Treasury bills and high-return assets) does the net result favor unrebalanced portfolios.

# Extension 2 Mean reversion or momentum bias in returns can influence the optimal rebalancing interval

The above calculations assume returns with zero autocorrelation, so diversification return does not rely on mean-reverting asset prices. If asset returns are negatively autocorrelated, performance may be further boosted by picking an expedient rebalancing interval. (This is much easier with hindsight.) Conversely, if returns exhibit short-term momentum, very frequent rebalancing can detract from performance.

In an ideal world of zero-autocorrelated returns and no trading costs, very frequent rebalancing makes sense because it reduces both tracking error and (typically negative) covariance drag. However, the presence of trading costs and, possibly, short-term return momentum make longer rebalancing intervals more attractive.

# A close cousin: Volatility targeting

Instead of targeting certain nominal weights, leveraged investors often target some overall volatility level and certain relative volatility (or VaR contribution) weights for strategies or asset classes. Indeed, return volatility is a more natural measurement unit (than dollar allocation) for strategies or assets whose unlevered standalone volatilities differ hugely. HFs use various ways of scaling or targeting volatility to improve their portfolios. When trading a long-short position, pairwise volatility scaling (weighting long and short legs by their empirical volatilities or betas) reduces and (if risk estimates are accurate) potentially eliminates the position's market directionality. Assigning equal volatilities to an active portfolio's risk sources or constructing a minimum variance portfolio tends to improve diversification and thereby risk-adjusted returns. Targeting volatility over time seems to help stabilize risk (reduce the volatility of volatility) and even enhance performance because higher near-term volatility does not enhance near-term expected return, for almost any investment is more predictable in the near term than returns are. Simply targeting a constant volatility often improves long-run returns compared with a strategy of maintaining constant nominal position sizes over time.

# 28.2.3 Risk adjustment: Looking beyond the Sharpe ratio

The SR is by far the most popular measure of risk-adjusted return for absolute return managers and investment strategies. It is rightly viewed as a tremendously useful tool for investment analysis and portfolio construction. Indeed, investors often make SR maximization the key objective for their portfolio [1].

Yet, the SR has its limitations, mirroring those of volatility as a risk measure for a portfolio. The world is too complex for any single number to capture its multi-faceted risks. Simply put, not all volatility is equal. Reasonable investors may accept a lower portfolio SR in exchange for improving other portfolio characteristics. I stress four arguments that justify looking beyond volatility as the risk measure and thus beyond SR as the performance measure:

- losses in bad times hurt more than bull market losses—thus protecting the portfolio in bad times is essential;

- large losses are particularly disliked—thus investors should differentiate between upside and downside volatility:
- illiquid assets warrant higher SRs as a result of illiquidity premia and understated volatilities:
- adverse tail events are made more likely by complexity, operational risk, and other unquantifiable features.

Each argument implies a tradeoff between the SR and some other portfolio attribute. This subsection brings together the many dimensions of the problem and provides empirical examples.

# Tradeoff #1 Timing of losses

The SR does not care whether gains or losses occur under good or bad economic conditions. Most investors do. For a given SR, they prefer an investment that made money in 2008 over one that made money in 2006.

The year 2008 was the annus horribilis for today's investors. Besides re-acquiring general respect for risk in 2008, investors re-learned to differentiate between volatility sources:

- Nearly all risky and illiquid assets, as well as positive-carry strategies and absolute return managers, turned out to be bad diversifiers: they became even more positively correlated than in normal times.
- Good diversifiers were rare. The scarcity of safe haven assets makes them especially valuable, as they provide diversification when it is most needed. Trend-following strategies were among the few safe havens, besides government bonds.

These patterns are not unique to 2008. We can use two contrasting trading styles—carry seeking and trend following—as illustrations of bad and good diversifiers. This example has broader applicability because many fund managers and HF style indices are well characterized by their exposure to either style (or to both). Figure 28.1 highlights the

Figure 28.1. Monthly returns for carry and trend-style proxies in the 15 worst months for global stocks, 1985-2009.

opposite directional risks of broad carry and trend composites, two of our simulated strategy portfolios [2]. Looking at the 15 worst months for global equities since 1985 (5\% of the left tail), the carry strategy lost money in 11 of the 15 months, while the trend strategy was profitable in 13. The carry strategy is also positively correlated with equity market indices, broad hedge fund indices, and large institutional portfolios, while the trend strategy is negatively related to most of them.

# Tradeoff #2 Return asymmetry

Volatility treats gains and losses equally. Investors of course like gains and dislike losses—especially large losses (negative skewness). When it comes to return asymmetry, the trend proxy has greater upside volatility than downside volatility while the opposite is true for the carry proxy (and most risky assets). Moreover, the trend proxy has much smaller maximum drawdown and better skewness characteristics (where positive skewness is preferred to negative) than the carry proxy.

Both style proxies have been profitable in recent decades, with appealing long-run paper SRs near one [3]. When we look beyond the SR, the trend style is clearly the more benign source of return, given its superior diversification ability and positive skew. In contrast, the carry style resembles "selling lottery tickets that pay off in bad times", combining negative skewness with toxic timing of losses—besides being vulnerable to abuse by unskilled managers.

# Tradeoff #3 Liquidity

The SR ignores liquidity considerations, but we know that illiquid assets have artificially smooth returns and thus overstated SRs. Moreover, illiquid assets should offer some compensation (illiquidity premium) for their higher trading costs and lesser flexibility as well as for their tendency to underperform during liquidity droughts.

Both considerations imply that investors should require higher measured SRs for illiquid asset classes than for liquid asset classes. Recall that Figure 2.2 showed a positive relation across asset classes between our illiquidity estimates and long-run SRs. It is possible, however, that the desire of many investors to avoid mark-to-market volatility makes less liquid assets overpriced, reducing the reward for illiquidity.

# Tradeoff #4 Unquantifiable tail risks

Some investors may also trade off the SR against complexity, opacity, novelty, funding leverage, overcrowding, or operational risk. These attributes are less quantifiable than the portfolio's diversification or asymmetry characteristics but they all contribute to tail risks. Being simpler and more robust, more transparent and better tested, not being hostage to a lender's whims or to sharp liquidations, and not being subject to blatant operational risks are all factors that arguably make tail events less likely. Investors may focus too much on measurable "normal times" risks and too little on unquantifiable risks. The latter often dominate tail events and disproportionately occur in bad times. Operational risks (errors and fraud) are a good example; the SR of Madoff's track record was hard to beat but it came with huge operational risk.

# Conclusions

The portfolio SR is a good starting point but it needs to be supplemented with other portfolio attributes. All of the desirable attributes discussed above may be worth some SR sacrifice. However, no single risk-adjusted return measure can capture them all, and many of these tradeoffs can only be assessed in a qualitative fashion. Multiple performance metrics are needed, given the multi-dimensional nature of the problem.

# 28.2.4 Smart risk taking and portfolio construction

There now follow some intuitive rules of thumb for smart investing: a recipe for optimal diversification and the "fundamental law of active management".

First, here is a recipe for smart portfolio construction, which sums up mean variance optimization in a nutshell: allocate equal volatility to each asset class (or return source) in a portfolio, unless some assets' exceptional SRs or diversification abilities justify deviating from equal volatility weightings. Asset classes with high SRs or with negative correlations (vs. the rest of the portfolio) should be overweighted until the portfolio SR can no longer be improved.

- If assets are equally attractive in terms of expected returns and diversification abilities, they deserve equal volatility shares in an optimal portfolio. Allocating equal volatility shares maximizes diversification if all assets have similar diversification abilities.
- Equal volatility portfolios ignore information about expected returns—as do minimum variance or maximum diversification portfolios. These approaches implicitly assume that all assets have the same reward-risk ratio.
- Since this recipe loosely mimics mean variance optimization, it shares any shortcomings of the mean variance framework, such as ignoring liquidity considerations.

The hugely influential fundamental law of active management, discovered by Richard Grinold, states that, under certain simplifying assumptions, a portfolio's risk-adjusted return in excess of its benchmark (i.e., the portfolio's information ratio or IR), reflects skill and breadth:

$$

\mathrm {I R} \approx \mathrm {I C} * \sqrt {\text {B r e a d t h}}

$$ where the information coefficient, IC, is the amount of investment skill per trade, measuring the investor's forecasting ability by the correlation between predictions and realizations; and breadth is the number of independent trades (i.e., trades not using the same information) per year, representing diversification opportunities. (Note that the IR is the part of the SR due to active management against a benchmark, the rest is due to variation in the returns of the benchmark. If the portfolio's benchmark has zero volatility, then  $\mathrm{IR} = \mathrm{SR}$ .)

The breadth concept underscores the shortcomings of market-timing strategies where few independent views are taken each year. Breadth can be improved by selecting portfolios from a large set of securities, by combining many strategies, or by taking views more frequently. That is, for a single strategy, updating a view with a given predictive correlation (IC) on a weekly basis boosts the SR or IR about seven times ( $\sqrt{52}$ ) more than updating a view with the same correlation on an annual basis. Apparently, if you market-time, you should change your views often (as long as your views have a reasonably high probability of being correct). In reality it is harder to make accurate forecasts every week than once a year; moreover, higher trading costs may fully offset any benefits of fast-moving signals.

It seems likely that widening breadth comes at the expense of lesser skill. Breadth also assumes that trades are uncorrelated, while in reality many trades tend to use the same information, making them positively correlated. Highly positively correlated trades are poor diversifiers, while negatively correlated trades are excellent diversifiers. The latter are rare but are often worth adding to the portfolio even if they (modestly) reduce its expected returns. Examples of pairs of such super-diversifiers include pro-growth equities and anti-growth Treasuries, the value or contrarian style and the momentum style, and carry and trend styles.

Extensions to the fundamental law incorporate constraints, trading costs, or illiquidity; allowing correlations between forecasts and assets; recognizing the uncertainty of inputs, or relaxing other underlying assumptions such as normally distributed asset returns or mean variance preferences:

- When assets and/or strategies have symmetrically distributed returns, volatility and downside risk measures are interchangeable. When not, it is useful to track portfolio skewness or downside risk measures as well as overall volatility. For many traders, stop-loss limits and other risk management rules are essential tools, but the use of risk control techniques may reduce expected returns.
- Robust approaches and simple measures bring more stable performance in a world where non-normalities, outliers and rare events, estimation errors, and time-varying relations abound. Moreover, we rarely find that complex approaches really improve real-world performance, though this is naturally a topic of debate among quants.

Diversification of course has limitations, one of which is the tendency for correlations to approach one during crises [4]. Many good traders and absolute return managers distinguish themselves by managing downside risk instead of just relying on diversification. They use options, stop-loss rules, and innovative ways to buy tail risk insurance to limit the downside. Absolute return managers often emphasize that risk management and avoidance of large drawdowns is key, first, to their survival and, second, to their good long-run compound returns.

# 28.3 INVESTMENT HORIZON

# Exploiting a long horizon

Long-horizon investors are well suited to capturing positive illiquidity premia, term premia, and even other risk premia (as they can tolerate such risks better than the average investor in the market). True long-horizon investors are a minority in the marketplace. Indeed, the relative share of short-horizon and long-horizon investors in the market should influence the size of such premia. Arguably, the share of both true and wannabe long-horizon investors grew rapidly in the mid-2000s, a situation that contributed to excessive narrowing of these premia in 2005–2007. Long-horizon investors may not only have a natural edge in generally holding illiquid and risky assets but also in being opportunistic buyers and liquidity providers whenever the market's risk aversion and liquidity needs are especially high [5].

# Box 28.2. Compound returns

A probably apocryphal quote has Einstein calling compound interest the eighth wonder of the world. Table 28.2 illustrates the power of compounding. Over 50 years, an investment earning a  $4\%$  annual return grows sevenfold. If a  $10\%$  return can be achieved, it grows 117-fold! Any investment marketer worth her salt knows that showing final wealth over a multi-decade window is much more impressive than showing annualized return. To really benefit from compounding, an investor needs time, return, and re-investing. The last two rows of Table 28.2 show that 111 of the 117 final dollars were due to re-investment return.

The best known story of compound interest is the legend of Indians selling the island of Manhattan in 1626 to a Dutch merchant for  \$24 worth of glass beads. Had these Indians invested and earned a compound return near 6\%$  for 380 years, their stake would have grown to about 100 billion with which they could have bought back a good chunk of Manhattan real estate in 2006—with improvements. Had the Indians managed to compound their wealth at an  $8\%$  rate, the price of the beads would have grown into 120 trillion—close to the best current estimate of all financial wealth in the world.

Of course, nobody could ever compound wealth over centuries at  $6\%$ , let alone at  $8\%$ . Even if the U.S. equity market had offered close to an  $8\%$  nominal compound return over the past 200 years, taxes, fees, and trading costs would have chipped away a decent chunk of this return. Just as importantly or more so, no family or institution has had the patience to keep re-investing for centuries without redemptions and spending.

In Table 28.2 I underline two values near 2. They are examples of the convenient "rule of 72" which says that the number of years in which you double your money is approximated by the number 72 divided by the percentage rate of return. Doubling your money takes 72 years at  $1\%$ , 16 years at  $4\%$ , about 10 years at  $7\%$ , and about 7 years at  $10\%$ .

The investment horizon can be intimately tied to an institution's liabilities, explicit or implicit. For many pension funds and life insurance companies, long-dated (nominal or real) liabilities imply that long-dated (nominal or real) bonds are effectively riskless assets. Indeed, these institutions' demand for long-dated bonds has contributed to the flatness or inversion of the back end of many yield curves. In many real-world cases, the investment horizon is uncertain (and the perceived horizon is often positively related to market conditions and investor risk appetite). Banks, central banks, and corporations tend to have a short horizon, while customer deposits, FX reserves, and excess cash tend to be held for long periods. These institutions need to be prepared to satisfy sudden cash demands (such as are caused by a bank run, currency crisis, or various corporate expenses). Endowments, foundations, and sovereign wealth funds are closest to having permanent capital, but the first two have recurring spending needs each year, whereas the sovereign wealth funds of some commodity-rich countries can expect their net inflows to grow for another decade and net outflows to start only in the distant future.

# Time diversification

Time diversification—the idea that stock market investing becomes less risky with a longer horizon—is a contentious issue. Jeremy Siegel, who wrote several editions of a book entitled Stocks for the Long Run, has studied over two centuries of U.S. equity market returns and publicized the empirical fact that, although short-term returns are nearly as likely to be down as up, the probability of losing money over a 20-year window has been negligible. Realized variances of annualized returns over long horizons are significantly lower than those over short horizons. These results could reflect long-run mean reversion and/or exceptionally benign market experience in the U.S., but they may be more generally true.

Indeed, it is a mathematical fact that if stock returns have zero autocorrelation (i.e., if they are a random walk) the volatility of average annual returns falls with a longer horizon, and if stock returns are a random walk with upward drift (i.e., positive expected return) the likelihood of negative cumulative returns falls with a longer horizon. Critics counter that the volatility of cumulative returns and the magnitude of potential losses increases with the time horizon.

Kritzman (2000) reminds us of Paul Samuelson's mathematical result that under certain conditions expected utility maximizers should hold a constant share of their wealth in risky assets irrespective of their investment horizon. Merely having a longer horizon does not make investors more risk tolerant as long as they have constant relative risk aversion, asset returns follow a random walk, and future wealth depends only on investment returns—not on human capital. Relaxing any of these assumptions can justify a greater weight in risky assets for long-horizon investors. Thus stock market investing can be safer for them:

(i) if they exhibit risk aversion that is less wealth dependent than that of typical investors (whose risk aversion may increase sharply when they become poorer and approach their subsistence level); or

(ii) if stock returns are mean-reverting (losses over one period are more likely to be offset by higher returns in the future, thereby reducing multi-year volatility); or

(iii) if they are young with flexible and plentiful human capital (first, in case equity returns disappoint, they can offset the impact by working a little harder to supplement their labor income; second, the mere fact that human capital is a larger share of their total wealth when they are young suggests that they can take more risk with their financial wealth).

One strand of the debate over time diversification studies the preference-free environment of option pricing; some argue that the cost of insurance against declines in the market rises with the length of the time horizon, others that the cost of such insurance declines on a per annum basis.

New research adds a powerful argument against time diversification. Pastor and Stambaugh stress the uncertainty about mean returns, which is a more important long-term risk than the classic measure (short-term volatility around the mean). Mean stock market return has been near  $10\%$  in the past, but this is only an estimate, and the future mean will almost certainly be different. When uncertainty about the true mean (and other parameters) is included, long-horizon investors face more volatility than short-horizon investors.

# Box 28.3. Retail investors and the time dimension

Lifecycle investing. As noted above, young people can more easily compensate for poor realized market returns with greater work effort; therefore young people can hold a larger share of their wealth in stocks. Many financial advisors use the rule of thumb "percentage in bonds and cash equals your age". This idea is at the heart of so-called target date funds. While the proximate goal is to ensure sufficient retirement income, the broader goal is consumption smoothing over the lifecycle. Others emphasize the importance of guaranteeing some minimum level of inflation-protected pension income by purchasing real lifetime annuities. Pension investment decisions are further complicated by the uncertainty of personal health costs and longevity (health care inflation has long outpaced general consumer price inflation), by insufficient pension savings, and by concerns about pension providers' or governments' ability to fulfill their (often excessive) commitments. Given the large demographic changes expected in the first half of the 21st century, these issues will surely have a large impact on asset returns. Unfortunately, these important topics are outside the scope of this book.

Dollar cost averaging. One common investment approach is to invest a constant dollar amount into the equity market on a regular basis. (This approach is called dollar cost averaging, because with a constant outlay every month you end up buying more shares at low prices and fewer at high prices.) The main advantage is that dollar cost averaging gives discipline to an individual's plan for saving by investing in equities. It can also reduce the regret associated with mistiming purchases and it may benefit from any mean reversion in aggregate market valuations. However, excluding the mean reversion argument (on which empirical evidence is weak), standard finance theory says that dollar cost averaging is suboptimal. If investors postpone equity investments despite having earned and saved a given amount of cash income, they delay earning the equity premium and thus reduce long-run returns. If the optimal portfolio is a given combination of riskless assets and risky equity, theory advises instantly allocating any new cash income to riskless and risky assets in these optimal proportions. Newer ideas about time-varying risk premia may justify the contrarian market timing implicit in dollar cost averaging, but only for those investors who differ from the average market participant. Finally, in a world of low risky asset premia, the benefits of discipline come more cheaply.

# 28.4 SKILL

# Finding skill

Besides trying to reap risk and illiquidity premia, trying to add value by skillful active management is the other popular way to try to boost the prospective returns on one's portfolio. It is well known that beating the market is difficult, but few deem it impossible. (Over  $80\%$  of U.S. equity mutual fund assets are actively managed, and over  $50\%$  of institutional mandates are for active management.) Traditionally, most academics argue that markets are broadly efficient (see Section 5.3), while many practitioners laugh at the notion. In addition to deciding whether the market is too efficient for them to bother to try to beat it, investors need to judge their own ability to be among the winners in a negative-sum game.

Given that prior views on this question are so polarized, it is perhaps not surprising that there are two public puzzles that ask virtually opposite questions: (i) Why is most delegated portfolio management still allocated to active managers? and (ii) Why is such a small share of institutional risk budgets allocated to active managers?

- Equilibrium accounting shows that the sum of all active risk-taking positions—deviations from a passive market portfolio—must amount to zero. Thus, active management is a zero-sum game before costs and fees, and a negative-sum game after they are included. Any gains one active investor makes must come at the expense of a losing active investor. The average active investor must deliver a lower net return than the average passive investor who benefits from much lower costs and fees. In jargon, the net alpha is negative.
- Robert Litterman's "active risk puzzle" notes that only a small share of institutional risk budgets is allocated to active management. (Even when capital is allocated to long-only active managers, tracking error targets tend to be much lower than the volatility of underlying assets.) Given that equity market risk takes up  $90\%$  of many risk budgets, and the related SR is about 0.3, the small share of active risk must imply a much lower expected SR for active management. Yet, virtually anyone marketing active management services promises a higher SR, so a higher allocation to active risk should be easy to justify.

The two puzzles address two distinct issues. The first puzzle is about the inability of the average active investor to beat the market, while the second one is about identifying superior managers (or being one oneself). Overconfidence, salesmanship, and ignorance make most investors—amateur or professional—believe that they can beat the market or select winning managers. It is part of human nature that we believe that we are above average like the mythical children of Lake Wobegon and, certainly, all professional active managers (must) profess to be superior investors. Only past winners market their track record; others toil silently or leave the field. Most people prefer to overlook these facts.

Truly superior investors do exist, but they are rare, hard to find in advance, and costly. Likewise, identifying winning individual securities requires a lot of effort, or luck:

- There will always be some manager who is outperforming—and a small minority have consistently succeeded over very long time periods. Many academics argue that most superstars may just be lucky, given the broad universe of candidates. Indeed, evidence on performance persistence among mutual fund managers is scant, although it is better among alternative asset managers.
- Manager return predictability is improved if there are shared characteristics among the few consistent outperformers. Warren Buffett famously responded to academic claims about lucky coin-flippers that a disproportionately large number of winners in the investment game are residents of Graham-and-Doddsville (i.e., value-oriented investors). In contrast, successful market-timers are a rare species. (Not even purists assign all the success of Warren Buffett to luck rather than skill, but they may insist that individual superstars are identified with hindsight. For example, the star status of Bill Miller and Ken Griffin was questioned after both stumbled in 2008.)
- One promising shared characteristic is manager willingness to take active risk instead of hugging the benchmark. There is evidence that mutual funds with a high "active share" (fraction of portfolio that differs from the benchmark index), or those with a low  $R^2$  against the market, tend to outperform peer funds. Also, in the HF space, the most distinctive or crowd-bucking managers perform especially well. Echoing these results, both mutual fund managers' best ideas and HF managers' high-conviction trades demonstrably add value. So why do managers with apparent stock-picking skills tend to underperform their benchmarks? It is lukewarm positions added to the portfolio to boost diversification and to reduce tracking error against the index that appear to detract from value.
- Investor skill does not automatically ensure gains for end-investors. The influential Berk-Green (2004) model of delegated asset management implies that competition for skillful managers eliminates any gains for investors in active funds even when skillful managers and performance persistence exist. Investors correctly take past outperformance as a signal of investment quality, but performance-chasing demand allows fund managers to extract all the rents they can from their skill; they raise their AUM until they no longer offer excess profits after fees and transaction costs.

Life would be easier if some clear investor group could be identified as exhibiting superior performance and steadily extracting alpha from other market participants:

- The old idea was that professional investors outperform at the expense of individual investors. However, hundreds of studies since the 1960s confirm that the majority of professional active managers underperform their benchmarks (not retail investors' benchmarks, but institutional investors' own benchmarks). Most studies compare active mutual fund manager returns with index returns; for example, Wermers (2000) and Fama-French (2009) find that average returns in excess of a relevant index are mildly positive before fees but negative after fees. Taking a broader approach, French (2008) estimates various costs and fees that the U.S. active equity management industry accrues; he concludes that end-investors have on aggregate overspent about  $70\mathrm{bp}$  per year, compared with a passive alternative. The aggregate cost has been surprisingly stable over time because lower trading costs have been offset by a shift to higher fee products and higher turnover.
- Evidence is more mixed for managers of institutional funds. These funds tend to outperform their mutual fund peers, likely reflecting lower fees and lower agency costs. However, pension plan sponsors do not exhibit manager selection skills; newly fired managers tend to subsequently outperform newly hired managers [6]. Endowment funds show generally good performance and the largest endowments have the best track records. This evidence is consistent with the idea that large, resource-rich institutions can add value, but it could also reflect the one-time effect of early entry into alternative assets.
- Hedge funds are the prototypical skilled investors of the 21st century. It looks like HFs can outperform even as a group by extracting alpha from others—long-only institutions, retail investors, corporations, and the public sector. Section 11.4.2 reviews various good reasons for HFs' success (expertise, flexibility, motivation, breadth) but also doubts about their record and its sustainability (reporting biases, hidden risks, growing competition, high fees, and asymmetric incentives). Finally, even those who question whether the average HF can provide positive net alpha tend to recognize that more investors with superior skills exist in this universe than anywhere else.

Alpha-beta separation and portable alpha have been popular themes during the past decade. Traditional fund managers bundle alpha and beta together at relatively unattractive combined costs. (Active long-only managers take modest active risks and deliver even more modest active returns, but the fees, while modest by alternative investment standards, are often shockingly high as a proportion of value added, often actually exceeding the value added.) End-investors found that by separating alpha bets and beta bets, they could save costs and make more efficient risk allocations. End-investors have therefore consistently de-allocated capital from traditional active managers and moved it toward an alpha-beta barbell (as well as to alternative asset classes). HFs, ideally market-neutral ones, form the natural alpha (skill) source, while low-fee index funds or index derivatives form the natural source of beta (risk premia). The combined fees for this barbell can be lower than for traditional managers, and combined after-fee returns higher. There are limits to this trend, however: separating alpha and beta is much harder, perhaps infeasible, in less liquid asset classes such as private equity and real estate.

# Applying skill

It is too simplistic to equate skills and HFs, alpha and HFs, or skills and alpha. Not all HF managers are skilled and not all skilled investors work for HFs. HFs do not only deliver alpha but also traditional and alternative betas (see Section 11.4.3, which stresses that alpha is always defined in the context of a factor model as the uncorrelated, unexplained part of returns). Skill is not only used in alpha generation (narrowly defined as view taking) but also in smart portfolio construction, risk management, and cost-efficient implementation. Critics emphasize fees and agency problems which can prevent the fruits of skillful management from reaching the end-investor. Last but not least, ex post alpha reflects luck (randomness) as well as skill, and possibly also overfitting or reporting biases. (For these reasons, it is important to evaluate investments by the ex ante quality of decision making, not just by ex post success.)

Skill can be applied in various ways. If we focus narrowly on view taking, the classic distinction is between actively timing the market and selecting securities, or, in between, allocating across asset classes, countries, sectors, styles, or managers. Another distinction is between discretionary and systematic managers, again with a fuzzy boundary. Most managers use similar information—both fundamental and technical indicators—but the discretionary ones make subjective decisions based on them, while the systematic ones try to code up their week-to-week decision rules. Finally, skill can be applied in in-house active management or in selecting external managers.

Skill does not alone determine expected value-added; one also needs opportunities to apply any skills. Mechanically, the fundamental law of active management says that expected risk-adjusted return depends on investing skill and the breadth of the opportunity set to which the skill is applied. For a single trade, the expected risk-adjusted alpha depends on skill and signal strength (size of the current opportunity). Discretionary traders quickly dilute their skill when they widen their interests. Systematic investors can better exploit breadth (with their admittedly narrower information set).

Where is skill best applied? A common view is that alpha is best found in illiquid markets with inefficiently priced assets—where assets are harder to value, information travels more slowly, mispricings survive longer, and arbitrage is more difficult (because of high trading costs and a lack of substitutes). An alternative view favors liquid markets, because in illiquid markets it takes a lifetime to distinguish a skillful alpha producer from a lucky one, or from an investor whose apparent alpha is really beta. In contrast, frequent performance measurement in liquid assets enables skill to be differentiated from luck over a reasonable evaluation period. Moreover, only liquid markets give investors the flexibility to terminate, at a moderate cost, a manager that has disappointed.

# 28.5 COSTS

Cost control is important because fees and costs feed directly to the bottom line of net returns. John Bogle likes to stress that cost differences across mutual funds can explain differences in net fund returns much better than any other feature can. (Among HFs, fee differences do not explain net return differences.) I review in Section 28.1 various ways to reduce costs but I also note that the virtue can be taken too far. The costs of systematic investment mistakes can be much higher than direct trading costs and fees; recall the examples of "dumb money" in the previous subsection (see Note 6).

For small investors, explicit costs, such as commissions and bid-ask spreads, tend to dominate. For large investors, implicit costs (market impact, front-running, etc.) matter more.

External manager contracts involve relatively straightforward fixed fees and performance fees but also less visible costs related to asymmetric incentives, high-water marks, lockups, and other compensation specifics with HFs, and an even greater variety of costs with PE funds.

Trading costs are naturally higher for less liquid assets and for strategies that involve greater turnover. Trading only the most liquid assets and using buy-and-hold strategies are two ways to keep costs down—but they may keep returns down as well.

Trading costs influence the relative attractiveness of active styles by causing the tradeoff between horizon and signal decay to differ between styles. Persistent (slow-moving) value and carry signals always require less turnover than fast-decaying momentum/reversal and underreaction/overreaction signals. The former can be traded patiently without much signal decay (long-horizon trading); the latter require speed (short-horizon trading). All else equal, rising trading costs make patient trading more optimal and should result in persistent signals having a larger weight. In reality, falling trading costs have made high-frequency trading more economical, but only for market participants facing the very lowest trading costs, since before-fee profits from high-frequency trading tend to be razor-thin.

Long-horizon investors often ignore information from high-frequency signals—such as reversal, momentum, or seasonal effects—due to the turnover required. New research by Israelov-Katz (2010) shows that even long-horizon investors can benefit from such signals by delaying or avoiding trading implementation when "fast" signals counsel patience.

Urgency of implementation and demand for liquidity are linked at the hip. Liquid assets satisfy urgency needs, illiquid ones do not. One way to reveal urgency and demand liquidity is to place a market order. Conversely, limit orders can be used to supply liquidity (although care is needed with limit orders; recent research shows that stale limit orders are among the key reasons for retail investors' "dumb" losses). Demanding liquidity is especially costly when market volatility is high; conversely, liquidity provision is better rewarded amidst turbulent conditions. Short-term reversal strategies are one way to supply liquidity to other market participants; such strategies exploit temporary price dislocations due to large traders' market impact. The performance of such reversal strategies comoves closely with the VIX equity volatility index, which is a decent proxy for the market's liquidity conditions.

Patient trading may also reduce market impact costs as long as other players (counterparties, high-frequency traders, and competitors) are not able to predict and front-run your flows. And it is not only your own trading that matters. You can save on market impact costs by avoiding trading that is synchronous with that of other large players: for example, you should not rebalance at month ends, or trade popular index products, when the crowd is likely to act. As already noted, even so-called passive management can suffer from hidden costs. Exact index matching can be detrimental due to price pressure effects when many index holders synchronously buy (sell) index additions (deletions). You can improve long-run returns if you customize benchmarks and execution strategies that do not mechanically trade together with the index crowd. And a final mishmash of advice:

- Do not naively think that high fees are justified. Invest in costly products with care and thought (e.g., pay high fees only for credibly expected alpha). Pay less for alternative beta and even less for traditional bulk beta. Pay lower fees if you have to agree to lockups and other liquidity-hampering restrictions that favor the manager.
- Think twice before paying up for bad economic reasons, such as avoiding mark to market or earning high upfront yield. Do not ignore taxes (as this book by and large does; see Box 28.4).
- New alternative trading platforms and electronic trading venues are worth exploring.

# Box 28.4. Taxes

Taxes are a form of costs or slippage. This book ignores taxes, even though taxable investors should care only or mostly about (real) after-tax expected returns. Tax effects can even influence assets' pre-tax expected returns. Here are some examples of tax effects on financial markets:

- Taxation causes many forms of market segmentation. Certain assets—municipal bonds, low-coupon bonds, and zero-dividend stocks—are especially attractive for investors with high tax rates, which makes these assets overvalued from the perspective of non-taxable investors.
- The income tax rate is often higher than the capital gains tax rate. Even at the same tax rate, capital gains are a more attractive source of revenue than income because they allow greater tax flexibility. Investors can defer realizing gains and paying capital gains taxes, while harvesting capital losses that may offset other taxable income. Active strategies that involve high turnover are less tax efficient than passive strategies that delay taxation.
- Changes in tax laws over time can influence absolute and relative pricing. Falling tax rates from the 1980s to the 2000s contributed to rising equity market valuations, while the dividend tax cut in 2003 boosted demand for high-dividend-yield stocks.
- Mortgage interest rate deductibility influences both bond and real estate pricing. The yield spreads of mortgages and corporates vs. Treasuries partly reflect differential (state and local) tax treatment. Tax-loss selling contributes to turn-of-the-year and January effects.

# 28.6 NOTES

[1] Clearly, the riskiness of individual investments is not well captured by standalone volatility, which ignores their diversification abilities and timing of losses. For a portfolio, however, volatility could be a sufficient risk statistic. In standard mean variance analysis, a portfolio is optimal if it has the highest Sharpe ratio of those from which it is possible to choose.

[2] The carry style proxy is a composite of yield-seeking strategies in currency and fixed income markets. The trend style proxy is a composite of trend-following strategies in dozens of liquid assets from four asset classes: bond or interest rate futures, currencies, equity country futures, and commodity futures. These style proxies are presented in Chapters 13 and 14.

[3] Estimated trading costs, but not fees, have been subtracted from returns on style proxies. Net-of-fee returns of the main CTA indices imply long-run Sharpe ratios of 0.2 to 0.5, clearly lower than our trend style proxy.

[4] Defenders of diversification rightly stress that even if in systemic crises diversification temporarily fails "just when it is most needed", it still works well in the long run and really serves to reduce a portfolio's long-run volatility, which should matter more for long-horizon investors.

[5] However, state-of-the-art literature on long-horizon investing—such as Campbell and Viceira's (2002) work—does not capture the intuition that long-horizon investors can, like Warren Buffett, ride through short-term market fluctuations better than myopic investors, and thus also serve as opportunistic value buyers. Instead, intertemporal hedging demands can cause long-horizon investors in these models to be even more sensitive to changing opportunities than myopic investors are. Perhaps the reason is that this literature relies on utility functions without time-varying risk aversion. In reality, the key distinction seems to be that most investors exhibit wealth-dependent risk aversion (which would discourage them from buying more risky assets in bad times when time-varying risk premia are elevated) whereas long-horizon investors may have more stable risk preferences over time (and would derive utility gains from buying low-priced risky assets in bad times).

[6] A parallel finding is that investors in mutual funds and HFs hurt their long-run performance by poor timing and/or allocation decisions, likely by performance chasing at horizons where the reversal effect has overtaken momentum (buying multi-year winners and selling multi-year losers). As a result, dollar-weighted returns (which reflect inflows and outflows and better capture actual returns that fund investors have earned) are much lower than the same funds' time-weighted or buy-and-hold returns (which reflect average manager performance). Some estimate the gap at  $1.5\%$  for investors in mutual funds and at  $3\%$  to  $7\%$  (see Section 11.4.2) for investors in HFs. Such evidence (plus the stale limit order effect, overtrading, etc.) are used as justifications for arguing that smart investors have a great deal of opportunity to extract alpha from "dumb money" investors even given the zero-sum nature of overall active management.

# Takeaways for long-horizon investors

- There are many ways to improve investment practices to enhance long-run returns. Several can be pursued in parallel: collect risk premia from diverse sources; benefit (in moderation) from illiquidity premia, leverage, contrarian timing, and view-driven active management; be aware of risks and costs as well as own natural edges and limitations.
- Equity and illiquidity premia are good return sources but should not dominate the portfolio, especially when their ex ante rewards are slim. Entry and exit valuations matter.
- Returns may be enhanced by exploiting value, carry, and momentum tilts; valuation-based timing of any return source; and view-based alpha seeking.
- Prudent leverage enables effective diversification and helps investors avoid overpriced high-volatility assets.
- Do not seek comfort by avoiding leverage or headline risk while buying popular assets or lottery tickets. These errors hurt long-run performance.
- Long-horizon investors have certain comparative advantages that they should fully exploit.

In this "takeaways" chapter, I summarize theories about expected return determination, list which plausible sources of expected returns have and have not worked in practice, and address several relevant debates among investors. Institutional practices have already evolved from 60/40 local market stock/bond portfolios to globally diversified portfolios, often including emerging markets and alternative assets. The "Yale" or endowment model became increasingly popular in the 2000s. This model seeks high returns by holding equity-like asset classes, harvesting illiquidity premia from alternatives, and avoiding market timing. Large endowment losses in 2008 raised many questions about the wisdom of this strategy, however. Maybe market timing and drawdown control are not such bad ideas, after all, and maybe illiquidity is not such a great return source? Should equity orientation be replaced by more balanced portfolios, even if earning an acceptable return from a more balanced portfolio requires leverage? If valuations matter, shouldn't value tilts be cemented into asset allocation and security selection processes? Could it be more effective to diversify across underlying risk factors than across asset classes? Here, I review all the ideas in which I see merit, but I also note their shortcomings.

The next generation of best practice for enhancing returns involves pursuing several paths in parallel, instead of embracing one idea. It is up to every institution to decide, based on its goals, constraints, resources, and inclinations, what its priorities are. Diversity in choices is a good outcome for markets where investment approaches that are too homogeneous can lead to systemic problems. The same diversity also helps investors avoid overcrowded positions.

# 29.1 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THEORY

Not all volatility is equal. Investment returns reflect multiple factors, both rational risk premia and investor irrationality. Different return sources deserve different long-run rewards. An investment's typical timing of losses matters more than its standalone risk. Investors assessing risk and returns should therefore look beyond the Sharpe ratio and penalize investments that perform poorly in bad times. The key insight in modern finance theory is that such investments warrant high required risk premia, while valuable safe haven assets can justify negative risk premia.

The ex ante reward for each factor can vary over time and is often higher after poor medium-term performance. If return predictability reflects time-varying risk premia, exceptionally good market opportunities tend to materialize just when investor risk aversion and liquidity needs are high. Thus, contrarian market timing may be of greatest benefit to truly long-horizon investors whose risk tolerance is more stable and liquidity needs less than those of the average investor.

# 29.2 EMPIRICAL RETURN SOURCES

Here is my take on 10 potentially important sources of investment returns. Do you get rewarded with higher long-run returns for …?

1. High volatility and high beta? Not within asset classes. The most volatile assets tend to be overpriced due to skewness preferences or leverage constraints ("overpaying for lottery characteristics or getting bang for the buck"). Across asset classes, the riskier ones tend to outperform the safe ones in the long run.
2. Illiquidity? Yes. Less liquid assets do compensate for their illiquidity and tendency to lose money amidst liquidity droughts. This compensation, like others, is not constant over time.
3. Fast growth? Not unless you can predict future growth better than the market can. One of the most common errors of investors is over-extrapolating the past growth rate of a firm, sector, or country ("overpaying for the hope of growth"), leading to subsequent disappointments.
4. Cheap assets? Yes. The flipside of the above growth story is that value stocks (which sell at a price that is cheap relative to some fundamental metric) tend to outperform in the long run. The reason for low valuation ratios among stocks and other assets may be irrationality or rational compensation for risk. Both give rise to higher future returns.
5. Positive carry? Yes. Long-run reward has been especially good in cross-country trades and less compelling in within-country trades. Poor timing of large losses makes the strategy risky, but this riskiness should sustain long-run reward. Exception: When carry seeking is implemented through complex structured products, fees and risks often overwhelm any yield advantage.
6. Recent distress? Not in equity markets where low-rated and distressed stocks often keep underperforming for several months. (Over longer horizons, however, surviving stocks rebound smartly and contribute to the value effect.) Among corporate bonds, "fallen angels" recently downgraded from investment-grade rating offer high subsequent returns following forced selling by institutional investors.
7. Recent success? Yes. A positive trend, or momentum, does tend to persist in most asset classes, but the historical window matters. The best information regarding momentum is often in 6-to-12-month histories. A common error involves chasing returns over a multi-year horizon when reversal is more likely than continuation of the existing trend.
8. Leverage? Yes. Higher leverage boosts expected returns but also risks, sometimes substantially. Enhanced risk controls and differentiation between more and less risky leverage are important.
9. Diversification? Yes, if you are able and willing to use leverage to monetize the risk reduction benefits of diversification. Combining negatively correlated return sources is especially valuable and is often best done via alternative assets. Even long-horizon investors should not waste the complementary nature of value and momentum or carry and trend exposures.
10. Timing? Yes. The rewards for most of the above items vary over time in a partly predictable way. For example, fast growth and high liquidity are appealing features, but only at the right price. Yet, market timing, factor timing, and style timing are not easy and should be done in moderation.

One of my key recommendations is harvesting excess returns from a broad range of sources, not only relying on the equity premium. Admittedly, there is no consensus as to which other premia give a sustainable edge. The equity premium has the most compelling theoretical underpinning and it is larger (on an unlevered basis) than most other premia. No source of excess return can guarantee profits each year, but the diverse sources I highlight—illiquidity, value, carry, momentum—have given investors a solid long-run edge and deserve the benefit of the doubt. Beating the market is hard enough that it would seem wasteful not to use the tailwinds that these return sources give to long-run performance.

# Box 29.1. How going for comfort reduces long-run returns

Conventional or comfortable approaches to boosting expected returns tend to become overpriced and offer poor reward for risk, maybe even detracting from expected return. Common bad habits include

- to avoid (explicit) leverage, weighting asset classes or strategies with embedded or non-recourse leverage;
- to avoid leverage, weighting the highest volatility assets within an asset class;
- to avoid leverage, staying with equity-centric portfolios instead of monetizing gains from diversification into fixed income and other asset classes;
- to earn a possible illiquidity premium and avoid mark-to-market volatility, hoarding illiquid asset classes irrespective of valuations; to boost portfolio yield, buying corporate bonds and structures with embedded options.

Other conventional or comfortable choices that give rise to poor expected returns include return chasing and buying popular assets (hence the existence of profits for contrarian or value strategies), avoiding well-rewarded pockets in credit markets (BB-rated fallen angels and levered short-dated top-rated debt), and avoiding investments with headline risk (e.g., providing "insurance" after large losses when capital is scarce).

# 29.3 MY TAKE ON KEY DEBATES

# 29.3.1 Passive betas vs. active alpha seeking

One camp argues that all investing should be done passively by holding cheap betas—perhaps allocating  $60\%$  to stock indices and  $40\%$  to bond indices, with market cap weights within the asset classes and no market timing. Another extreme advocates only active investing, targeting absolute returns, with virtually no investment constraints nor benchmarks. There is a whole spectrum of views between these extremes.

Beliefs are crucial: the less investors believe in market efficiency and the more faith they have in their own ability to beat the markets or to select winning managers, the more they will favor active management. Ability should be judged objectively (to resist overconfidence); and resources and governance matter. A large, resource-rich institution may have a better chance of being among those rare consistent outperformers (although small, nimble funds may have an edge in activities that cannot be easily scaled up). Casual attempts to beat the market are likely to fail because active management is a zero-sum game even before costs and fees, and only players with well-above-average skill are likely to win. If an institution knows that it cannot be nimble and has historically acted procyclically, it should outsource market-timing efforts or else give them up. If it cannot incentivize its in-house managers well but believes that it is able to pick superior external managers, it should outsource all alpha efforts.

All else equal, lower fees and trading costs should encourage more active management. The choice between external and internal management also depends on relative costs, among other considerations.

The decision of where an institution should harvest risk premia depends on its assessment of where risks are rewarded. This book should help investors make better judgments when they allocate capital dynamically across various traditional and alternative beta sources. Flexible investors can cast the net out wide across multiple factors. Investors looking for high raw returns, if they are unable or unwilling to use leverage, must focus on inherently volatile asset classes such as equities.

The decision of where an investor should try to hunt for alpha depends on its views on relative market efficiency in different market segments—as well as on the manager's own relative advantages, skills, and costs. Fund size is one source of relative strength or weakness. Very large AUM may give an investor special opportunities to make capital infusions at preferential terms. However, large AUM also implies capacity constraints in smaller markets. Contrarian market timing may be less capacity-constrained than security selection.

A common view states that inefficiencies and alpha are most readily available in less liquid markets—small-cap stocks, frontier countries, unlisted assets—on which fewer investors and analysts shine light. One counterargument notes that non-economic actors and behavioral biases create macro-inefficiencies in liquid markets and that low transaction costs make it more realistic to exploit such opportunities. Moreover, in liquid markets it is more feasible to distinguish alpha gains from beta gains and to exit from disappointing investments. Net of all these considerations, I suspect that asset selection, relative value opportunities, and micro-inefficiencies are more lucrative in less liquid markets, while the reverse may be true for timing and macroinefficiencies.

Alpha-beta barbells make sense. Most of the risk budget should be accessed cheaply (bulk betas, alternative betas, in-house timing). Being simple and cheap with at least the core portfolio prevents active fee paying with all the AUM. The more costly active risk budget should be the smaller part, in which investors ideally only pay alpha fees for true alpha efforts—judged as much by ex ante qualities as by ex post performance. Alternative betas and other systematic approaches deserve fees between those that apply to bulk beta and to alpha, and may be brought in house in large organizations that have ample resources.

# 29.3.2 Lottery/Insurance selling or buying?

Lottery or insurance selling in financial markets is a blatantly risky strategy, but at least it tends to make money over long periods. It sure beats lottery buying as a long-run strategy. If investors want to counterbalance their exposures to pro-risk and short-volatility strategies, trend and momentum styles offer surprisingly appealing long-run returns given that they also have favorable risk-diversifying characteristics. In contrast, lottery-type small growth stocks and high-volatility segments in each asset class offer surprisingly poor long-run returns and unexceptional diversifying characteristics. As a rule, investors should stay away from lottery assets, except as needed to implement tactical views. Lottery buyers—or tail risk hedgers—need to pick their battles, either through smart timing or trade selection.

# 29.3.3 Leverage: Not all bad

Leverage has a bad name, and especially so after 2008. Real-money investors have preferred non-recourse leverage to explicit leverage, and such preferences may now be even more pronounced than in the past. It is true that leverage can increase blowup risk for a given investor and it can also amplify systemic risks overall; moreover, the need for forced de-levering is greater during financial crises and liquidity droughts if one has explicit leverage. But it is also true that prudent leverage can boost long-run returns by enabling effective diversification and avoiding overpriced high-volatility assets.

My most controversial recommendation is for institutions to accept some leverage as one way of enhancing returns, as long as it is not precluded by regulations. Differentiating between more and less risky leverage, rather than by explicit leverage and embedded non-recourse leverage, may be useful. Risky leverage includes boosting leverage to offset falling risk premia or falling volatility (as in 2006-2007), or levering up illiquid or inherently risky assets, or leveraging via borrowing in ways that are more likely to need to be unwound during financial crises or amidst capital scarcity. Less risky leverage includes levering up low-volatility assets to improve diversification, especially when done using liquid assets and vehicles that are less likely to cause forced liquidations or to involve counterparty risk (e.g., exchange-traded short-dated options and futures). Even the less risky approaches to leverage raise the standards needed in risk management and governance. Like derivatives, leverage can be abused.

Even without the benefit of avoiding overpriced assets, leverage can enhance long-run returns by monetizing the diversification benefits of better balanced, less equity-centric portfolios. Low-volatility asset classes tend to improve diversification and risk-adjusted returns. These improvements can be converted into higher expected returns by applying moderate leverage. Yet many real-money investors reject the use of leverage and instead opt for equity-centric risk budgets and/or (overpriced) high-volatility assets or investments offering non-recourse leverage.

Leverage aversion and leverage constraints made low-volatility assets relatively attractive on a risk-adjusted basis even in recent decades, when use of leverage was more widespread. In the coming years, with many investors newly shy of using leverage, the benefits of moderate amounts of explicit leverage seem likely to increase further.

# 29.3.4 Liquidity—overvalued or undervalued?

The standard argument in the endowment model is that illiquid assets offer a premium both for illiquidity and for the fact that systematic liquidity risk materializes mostly in bad times. By holding liquid assets investors forfeit these premia, thereby reducing long-run average returns. For long-horizon investors who do not need short-term liquidity, harvesting illiquidity premia seems to be the most obvious natural edge. Long-horizon investors' demand for illiquid asset classes arguably went too far in the mid-2000s. Illiquidity is not worth bearing if it is not properly rewarded. Although ex ante illiquidity premia are not directly observable, it is evident that institutional interest drove these premia to levels that were too thin.

Critics of the endowment model argue that real-money investors undervalue liquidity and ignore(d) the time-varying nature of liquidity premia. Liquidity gives you several benefits. Effectively, an investor in liquid assets is long an option that gives him or her flexibility to sell and to adjust the portfolio at will. Liquid holdings ensure that you must never rely on forced selling in bad times and instead can take advantage of exceptional opportunities in those times. To get this reward, you must pay a (tail) insurance premium in good times by holding cash and other low-earning liquid and safe haven assets (keeping your powder dry), or by explicitly purchasing insurance in the options market.

I stress that, even for long-horizon investors investing in illiquid assets, starting valuations can matter greatly. A contrarian timing approach may even boost long-run returns, as investors provide liquidity opportunistically only when it is well rewarded—not at all times. At least it should help reduce drawdowns in those bad times when the value of one extra dollar is especially high, when even long-horizon investors see their investment horizons shrink, and when even capital-rich investors feel the scarcity of capital.

# 29.3.5 To time or not to time?

Until recently, the consensus view among academics and institutional investors was negative on market timing. Successful timing is hard, the risk is undiversified, and staying in cash involves forfeiting a positive long-run premium. Being "correct but early" in calling a market turn exposes investors to serious career risk. The experience of the two boom-bust cycles in the 2000s has changed many minds, however.

Not only equity market risk but also most return sources have time-varying ex ante rewards. Static allocations to rewarded factors give useful average tilts but it is wasteful to keep the same exposures when estimated ex ante rewards are exceptionally small or large (as in credit investments in 2006 and 2008, respectively).

Contrarian timing signals are a natural starting point. Simple valuation signals possess some ability to predict medium-term returns. Other indicators can complement these value signals. Most return sources exhibit short-term momentum and long-term reversal tendencies, in part reflecting their fluctuating popularity. (I do not quantify here the gains from timing because overfitting and uncertain trading costs make any estimates highly uncertain.)

Even discretionary market-timers use systematic signals as one input to their decision making, but often their market views are driven more by their macroeconomic forecasts or perceived structural changes. Investors with ample resources should study valuations and market conditions, and then consider dynamic adjustments on either a discretionary or a systematic basis. If they lack expertise or nimbleness in house, they may also outsource the task to experts—say, by allocating mandates to global macro-funds.

Thus, I endorse moderate market timing, factor timing, and style timing. However, timing is not easy, so humility is warranted. Many organizations may not tolerate sustained underperformance—say, when a manager sells an overpriced market too early. Also, in active investing, the first rule should be "Do no harm". Some thoughtful institutions may find that in their organization—given an unclear mandate or other governance problems—any timing activity attempted would be likely to turn out to be of the common procyclical and return-chasing variety. In that case, they are better off resisting the siren songs of past performance by "tying themselves to the mast" and sticking to constant weight asset class allocations. At least over time they would gain discipline and modest profits from rebalancing.

# 29.3.6 Effective diversification

A key challenge to achieving diversification is reducing the dominance of equity risk. More balanced portfolios diversify better—notwithstanding the 2008 experience. However, balanced risk budgets often require leverage to achieve high returns, while unlevered diversification "only" achieves high risk-adjusted returns (i.e., low returns but with even lower volatility). If correlations spike, the well-diversified but levered portfolio may underperform an equity-centric unlevered portfolio. Even if diversification tends to fail in systemic crises, it can still be useful in the long run—which matters more for long-horizon investors who face less liquidation pressure during crises.

Most investments have positive exposures to the equity market and to economic growth. This directional risk is difficult to diversify away, making the elusive negative beta a valuable characteristic. The challenge is to find safe haven investments that are not too costly and work reliably. Of course, effective growth risk diversifiers are either very expensive (buying the VIX) or unstable (gold and oil worked well 30 years ago, Treasuries and the yen in 2008). It is not clear what will work in the 2010s; I stress the possibility that government bonds will lose their safe haven status.

Diversification should not ignore valuations. Especially if many asset classes are overpriced in good times, it seems likely that they may suffer together when bad times hit. The best results arise by combining the general goal of broad diversification with the underweighting of expensive and overcrowded asset classes or strategies.

Diversification across strategy styles or risk factors is often more effective than diversification across asset classes (recall the three-dimensional cube in Figure 1.2). Enabling purer style and factor exposures is therefore a key underappreciated benefit of investing in alternative assets (albeit not exclusive to them).

Style diversification. Combining value and momentum tilts (or related carry and trend tilts), which often are negatively correlated, provides more effective diversification than most static asset classes. A value or contrarian approach is a more natural style for long-horizon investors, but even they should add a dose of momentum or trend tilts that are complementary to their core (pro-risk, pro-reversal) positions. Negative correlation is simply too valuable a trait to ignore. At least momentum implies that long-horizon investors can be patient when apparent value opportunities arise, delaying part of their intended trading until the short-term momentum signal agrees with the long-run value signal. They can leg into contrarian positions gradually, keeping some ammunition until the market has turned.

However, even diversifying across negatively related styles can fail. For example, both value and momentum had a bad decade in the 1930s and both suffered sharp losses in August 2007. The latter episode reminds us of overcrowding risk, which can make any strategy hurt—typically, following persistent successes and excesses.

# Box 29.2. Style diversification vs. asset class derivatives

As a simple exercise, I study combinations of four asset classes (U.S. stocks, bonds, real estate, and funds of hedge funds) and the four strategy styles reviewed in Chapters 12-15 (equity value, currency carry, commodity trends, and volatility selling). Each composite is rebalanced to equal weights every month between 1990 and 2009. The asset class composite has greater market-directional risk: its correlation with global equities is 0.80, compared with 0.27 for the strategy style composite. The asset class composite also has average correlation among its four components (0.30) than does the strategy style composite  $(-0.05)$ . Thanks to its superior diversification, the strategy style composite has a double Sharpe ratio compared with its constituents' average Sharpe ratio (1.2 vs. 0.6). This simply reflects the fact that with four uncorrelated strategies, portfolio volatility is about half the constituents' average volatility, consistent with the fundamental law of active management (see Section 28.2.4). In contrast, the asset class composite sees a much more modest volatility reduction and Sharpe ratio increase.

This example focuses on diversification and deliberately steers away from average returns (which happen to be higher for the strategy style composite). Performance differences could reflect period-specific tailwinds or headwinds as well as differing volatilities. More importantly, the paper performance of strategy styles is more prone to being overstated (due to overfitting or selection biases as well as ignored or understated trading costs) than the paper performance of asset classes.

Risk factor diversification. The standard approach to asset allocation, which is to determine the nominal weights of asset classes, is gradually giving way to risk budgeting, or allocating risk weights (contributions to portfolio volatility). A more dramatic change will be to shift from allocating nominal or risk weights across assets to allocating risk across underlying risk factors.

The expected return and risk of a large portfolio is dominated by some key risk factors. Even if the investment approach involves fundamental bottom-up management (e.g., stock picking), or absolute return strategies (e.g., hedge funds), total risk is often driven by top-down factor exposures. Thus it is important to understand these exposures and to know whether they are well rewarded and well diversified. I have argued that underlying risk factors really determine the risk-reward tradeoff. The risk factors are then mapped into asset and/or strategy weights. For example, both a corporate bond and a small-cap stock reflect some exposures to growth, inflation, illiquidity, and volatility—as well as to the premia associated with these risks and characteristics.

I select these four factors, but stress that there is little consensus on the number and identity of factors. Open questions also remain on mapping between assets and risk factors (how one can best estimate the risk factor exposures of a given asset, how stable the relations are, etc.). The factor allocation approach has several advantages: it enables one to focus on the primary return drivers, more effective diversification, and more effective extraction of risk premia. Yet, it is less intuitive and less familiar to most investors than traditional asset class allocation, raising meaningful communication challenges. Thus, uptake of the risk factor approach may be slow and may begin with only the most sophisticated investors.

# 29.3.7 Diversification vs. drawdown control

Even though the endowment model made alternative assets more popular among institutional investors, some absolute return managers have been critical of the model. One strand of criticism against the endowment model is that it focuses excessively on equity-like asset classes and relies too heavily on an illiquidity premium as a source of returns. Another strand criticizes the model for having diversification as the only risk management tool and for avoiding market timing. All these features contributed to sharp drawdowns in endowment portfolios in 2008—though most absolute return managers lost money as well.

More generally, absolute return managers argue that benchmark-oriented managers pay too little heed to drawdown control. While benchmarks serve useful roles for ex ante guidance (the neutral "viewless" portfolio) and are the basis of ex post performance evaluation, they make it too easy to accept large absolute losses that hamper long-run return compounding. In contrast, absolute return investing centers on taking active market views while managing risk to preserve capital. The absolute return approach may be especially attractive when the world is in flux and facing structural changes, with macro-uncertainty and regulatory upheavals.

Admittedly, controlling drawdowns by stop-loss rules or by lower risk profiles comes at the expense of lower expected returns—unless the manager exhibits skill in market timing or in creating cheap tail risk insurance.

I find risk consciousness as important for active investors as return seeking and cost consciousness. Drawdown control may be done proactively or imposed from the outside (through regulatory calls or margin calls); the former seems preferable. Institutions that reduced risks before the fall of 2008 looked smart while those that did the same a few months later, near the market bottom, now look foolish with hindsight. Yet, I would not draw too broad a lesson from this experience because there was a real chance of further market declines, which might have forced many holdouts to capitulate later at even worse levels.

# 29.4 KNOW THYSELF: LARGE LONG-HORIZON INVESTORS' NATURAL EDGES

Investors should take into account their relative strengths and weaknesses. Here are some specific suggestions for exploiting the long investment horizon:

- harvesting illiquidity premia (e.g., infrastructure, non-city land);
- opportunistic insurance selling (against financial and natural catastrophes);
- contrarian market timing and asset allocation;
- contracts designed to mitigate agency problems—among the desired outcomes are making sure a delegated manager shares your long horizon and making sure you get compensated for long lockups.

The above apply for pure asset portfolios. Liabilities have obvious horizon implications: duration or cash flow matching between assets and liabilities.

Very large investors cannot be too active given their big footprint in the market, nor can they make much difference to their bottom line by investing in small, novel asset classes. For such investors, it is essential to get the major asset class decisions right and to implement core beta portfolios in a cost-effective manner:

- Being cost-effective does not necessarily mean market cap weighting if non-cap weights are deemed to give a return advantage sufficient to offset higher trading costs. But the larger weight an investor has in the marketplace, the larger the market impact cost its activity generates. It may be harder for large funds to deviate from market cap weights.
- A clearly contrarian active timing or allocation strategy may be possible, though, as there will be many investors on the other side. Large AUM funds with a long horizon thus have a natural edge in being opportunistic liquidity providers when capital is scarce.
- Despite capacity constraints, the largest and most resource-rich institutions should diversify very broadly across asset classes and strategies. This includes developing in-house competence in smaller market segments that may grow, to give the investor the edge that pioneers can have in growing markets.
- Large funds may have greater potential to be winners in the active management game. Successful in-house management is feasible but requires proper resources, governance, and incentivization.
- A smaller capital base has its benefits, and not just because it enables exploiting opportunities in smaller markets without capacity problems. Moreover, smaller funds can more easily lever up their capital base and benefit from superior opportunities in low-volatility assets, whereas super-sized funds may have to restrict themselves to seeking excess returns from markets that are inherently volatile.
- For the largest investors, it is especially important to avoid activities that are synchronous with those of other large players. One way this can be accomplished is to use customized benchmarks. It is also important for these investors to prevent their large flows from being gamed by counterparties or by other market participants.
- A prerequisite for successful investment management in any organization is getting the investment culture and governance structures right. Without these, investing may yield substandard results as well as organizational instability.

# 29.5 INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES

As is well known, a typical U.S. pension fund assumes an  $8\%$  long-run return for its portfolio. If bond yields are near  $5\%$ , and the portfolio is split 60/40 between stocks and bonds, the implicit expected return on equities is  $10\%$ . Many critics (rightly) point out that this long-run expectation is unrealistic and we have not seen  $5\%$  yields in a while. Cynics argue that expected returns are deliberately overstated because higher expected return assumptions reduce the apparent present value of pension obligations (using the dubious, but often legally mandated or at least accepted, practice of using expected asset return as the discount rate for an associated liability). Aggressive return assumptions improve pension plans' funding ratio and can help pension-sponsoring firms publish higher top-line earnings and justify lower pension contributions.

Such pension accounting shenanigans were already under discussion a decade ago when typical return assumptions were even more aggressive (near  $10\%$ ). Practices have thus improved, albeit slowly. Private pension plans are hardly alone in engaging in such mischief. Overoptimistic assumptions have long enabled public pension plans to avoid facing their dire fiscal conditions [1].

Any fixed return targets for long-term returns can be criticized for ignoring some of the most basic market realities, such as time variation in inflation and ex ante real yields. For example, if investment portfolios over the past 30 or 40 years have achieved an  $8\%$  average nominal return amidst a  $5\%$  to  $6\%$  average realized inflation rate, it hardly follows that we can extrapolate nominal returns further, given current expected long-run inflation in the  $2\%$  to  $3\%$  range. Nominal targets are especially naive because of the obviously time-varying nature of inflation, but even real return targets should be reviewed occasionally because real rates and risk premia also change over time. In any case, the problems caused by missed real return targets are trivial compared with those caused by nominal guarantees. More generally, a sense that "we need  $X\%$  returns" irrespective of market reality typically leads to excessive and ill-informed risk taking.

Institutional investors cannot analyze their assets' expected returns and risks in isolation. In reality, their decision making must take into account their liabilities and regulatory constraints, as well as more nebulous issues: peer comparisons and competitive pressures, prospects for bailouts and regulatory forbearance, own governance structure, and non-financial considerations (such as social responsibility and sustainability, or a country's desire to hedge its core revenue source or to ensure access to strategically important resources). These topics require a book of their own and are best left for future research, even if they can influence investor behavior and thereby expected asset returns.

# 29.6 NOTES

[1] Separately, current U.S. law can be criticized on many grounds. The discount rates for pension liabilities should not vary across institutions. In fact, if pension liabilities are iron-clad, they should be discounted using the Treasury rate (assuming we still assign riskless status to Treasuries despite the fiscal troubles). A lower discount rate would push many overfunded pension plans to underfunded status—arguably making them face the reality and, more generally, forcing society to deal with the pension time bomb.

# Appendix A

# World wealth

This appendix reviews evidence on the relative sizes of various parts of world wealth. A market's size may indirectly influence its expected return; smaller markets can be less liquid and create capacity concerns for large investors, thus implying higher required returns. Any assessment of global wealth is plagued by problems of definitions (which wealth categories to include) and measurement (how to quantify values, how to treat leverage). Let's start with a simple story from major indices. At the end of 2009, the size of global equity markets was  \$45 trillion and the size of global bond markets was\$ 40 trillion. But what about non-public equity and debt, cash and money market instruments, real estate and infrastructure, durable goods and other personal holdings, commodities and other resources, art and other collectibles, convertibles and other hybrids, derivatives and structured products? Most importantly, what about human capital? The challenges are immense, as already highlighted in Ibbotson-Siegel-Love (1985), though more manageable than when assessing the amount of capital allocated to strategy styles:

- Investability is an important qualification. (i) Many important parts of wealth are not included in this analysis because they are not investable (or are illiquid and poorly measured). Some estimates suggest that natural resources (e.g., oil underground), privately held firms, and owner-occupied housing can each be worth tens of trillions of dollars, and thus comparable in size with public equity or debt markets. (ii) Securitization has in past decades made many previously illiquid assets or income streams investable and liquid. Yet, for many novel types of securitized debt this improvement proved ephemeral, as "good-times liquidity" vanished in 2007-2008.
- What counts as net wealth? Among publicly traded assets, only equity is unambiguously net wealth. Derivatives and debt are arguably not net wealth but side bets that cancel out. Bonds and other debt contracts are one party's asset and another party's liability. According to Ricardian equivalence, even government bonds are net wealth only if their value exceeds the present value of future tax liabilities. Larger public debts do not make citizens wealthier as prospective taxes rise. Along a similar line of thought, rising house prices may not raise a society's net wealth because the houseowners' gain is offset by the higher future cost of non-owners' housing services.
- Performance vs. net issuance. I will not try to track world wealth over time, but I remind the reader that any time series of market capitalization evolves over time both due to asset returns and to net issuance. For example, the fast growth of securitized assets or the Chinese stock market capitalization in the past 20 years reflects more new issuance than high returns. For equity investors it is important to understand that existing investors of listed shares only benefit from growth in current firms; historically, this includes less than half of aggregate real earnings growth (see Sections 8.4.3 and 16.4.1).
- Some wealth classifications add up management vehicles instead of assets: pension assets, insurance assets, mutual fund assets, private equity, and hedge funds. How do SWFs (sovereign wealth funds) and HNWIs (high-net-worth individuals) fit these classifications? And should we treat PE, HF, and structured products as wealth classes or management vehicles; the former choice may imply double-counting?

Without being pedantic about definitions, I quote here some interesting classifications and quantifications.

# A.1 GLOBAL TOTAL

- McKinsey Global Institute (2009) reports the size of global financial assets at 178 trillion (194 trillion) at end-2008 (end-2007). The main three parts are equities \$34 trillion (62 trillion), debt \$83 trillion (77 trillion)—of which 51 trillion is private debt and \$32 trillion is government debt—and bank deposits \$61 trillion (56 trillion). The total had grown from \$48 trillion in 1990 to \$112 trillion in 2000 and \$155 trillion in 2005. Separately, McKinsey estimates global residential real estate market size to be \$87 trillion at end-2008.
- For comparison, International Monetary Fund (2009) estimates end-2008 financial assets at  \$214 trillion. This total comprised equities\$ 34 trillion, debt \$84 trillion (private/public \$52 trillion/\$32 trillion), and bank assets \$98 trillion.
- Some assessments focus on the asset management vehicle rather than final investments. Boston Consulting Group (2010) estimates global (long-only) assets under professional management in 2009 at  \$53 trillion, of which\$ 32 trillion were institutional and \$21 trillion retail assets [1]. Alternative managers held much smaller AUM—HFs near \$2 trillion and PE funds a little less. SWFs held comparable amounts, though the size would multiply if central bank reserves were included.
- Yet other comparisons quantify the ultimate owner. Capgemini (2010) estimates the wealth of HNWIs at  \$39 trillion in 2009, after\$ 41 trillion in 2007 and 33 trillion in 2008. HNWI assets were split into 29\% equities, 31\% FI, 17\% cash/deposits, 18\% real estate, and 6\% alternatives. (Privately held enterprises and collectibles are excluded.)
- Many estimates involve double-counting (e.g., estimates of real estate, infrastructure, or resources involve listed equities, while HFs are net long equities). Most major equity indices nowadays adjust for cross-holdings.
- Such estimates typically exclude derivative instruments. Derivatives market notionals can be huge but misleading. Real risk exposures and cash outlays are orders of magnitudes smaller, especially after netting. Of the  \$532 trillion notional amount of financial instruments covered by OTC derivatives in June 2008, potential exposures to counterparties are estimated to be only\$ 2.7 trillion. These exposures are further reduced by collateral held against counterparty risk. Derivatives are best thought of as side bets.

# A.2 ASSET CLASS DETAIL

- Publicly listed equities are arguably the most important part of world wealth, least debatable, and most easily measured. (Even here questions exist about cross-holdings, free float, and investability.) The global market cap rose steadily from  \$30 trillion at end-2003, crossing\$ 50 trillion at end-2006, and peaking at \$62 trillion in October 2007. The market cap then halved over the next year, troughed at \$26 trillion in March 2009, before recovering to \$45 trillion by the year end. (For comparison, global GDP was \$50 trillion to 60 trillion, but this comparison mixes stock and flow variables.) The U.S. had about 30\% of world market cap, followed by 6\% to 8\% in each of Japan, China, and the U.K.
- The share of emerging markets in global market capitalization had risen from  $2\%$  in 1980 to  $12\%$  by end-2009. This share excluded many emerging market stocks that remain inaccessible to global investors and remains well below the  $30\%$  share of emerging countries in global GDP.
- Privately held enterprises may, on aggregate, be as valuable as publicly traded stocks. Vissing-Jorgensen-Moskowitz (2002) estimate that in the 1990s nonpublicly held equity by U.S. entrepreneurs was similar in size to the public equity market. Asian family enterprises, German "Mittelstand", and sovereign assets are global examples of wealth not captured in listed equities, but I have not seen good estimates. The values could be very high, but in any case these are not investable.
- Combining major fixed income market indices, the global bond markets amounted to  \$40.3 trillion in December 2009. Over half was government or government-related debt; this share will likely increase in coming years. The market value of all investment-grade bonds in the BarCap Global Aggregate index was\$ 35.2 trillion: \$17.4 trillion government, \$5.3 trillion government related, \$5.8 trillion corporates, \$6.7 trillion securitized (of which \$5 trillion U.S. MBS). To this I add smaller BarCap indices: global inflation-linked debt (mainly government) \$1.5 trillion, global high yield (mainly corporates) \$1.1 trillion, and global emerging market debt \$2.5 trillion (hard currency debt \$0.5 trillion and emerging local currency debt \$2.0 trillion—much of which may not be investable for foreigners).
- Other estimates of fixed income markets were twice as high,  \$80 trillion to 90 trillion. The above BarCap indices do not include money markets (debt with maximum maturity of 12 months), floating rate debt, municipal bonds, or convertible bonds (\$ 2 trillion and 0.2 trillion markets just in the U.S.), let alone the still huge segment of unsecuritized bank loans.
- Real estate markets are huge but only a small segment is investable. The most liquid segment—listed REITs and global property stocks—amounted to less than  \$1 trillion, while the U.S. real estate market alone totaled\$ 34 trillion. Francis-Ibbotson (2009) estimate \$18 trillion residential and \$16 trillion commercial real estate in the U.S. McKinsey Global Institute (2009) estimates higher numbers, likely using a different classification: the U.S. residential real estate market peaked at over \$30 trillion in 2006 and the global market peaked at \$91 trillion in 2007 (doubling in size since 1996, losing "only" 3.4 trillion in 2008).
- Some estimate the global infrastructure market at  \$8 trillion, but this presumably is largely listed equities. Among other alternative assets, the hedge fund and private equity fund markets were largest (near\$ 2 trillion each). Commodity funds have grown fast but their assets amounted to only about 0.25 trillion, a fraction of the size of listed natural resource companies or of privately held or sovereign-held natural resources.

# A.3 NOTES

[1] The largest groups in the institutional category were  \$17 trillion pension assets and\$ 8 trillion insurance assets. Assets managed for retail included mutual funds ( \$10 trillion), unit-linked pensions and insurance (\$ 6.5 trillion), and private banking ( \$4.5 trillion). Ineichen (2008) quotes higher estimates:\$ 62 trillion managed by traditional long-only institutions, of which \$23 trillion managed by pension funds, \$22 trillion by mutual funds, and 17 trillion by insurance firms.

# Appendix B

# Data sources and data-series construction

This appendix discusses the sources and construction of the various time series used in this book. In the main text, I list sources briefly beneath figure and table captions.

Most underlying data series are extracted from Bloomberg, including MSCI Barra's equity indices, Barclays Capital and other banks' bond indices, and S&P GSCI commodity futures indices. Other key sources include Kenneth French's website (visit http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html), Robert Shiller's website (visit http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm), Arnott-Bernstein (2002), Dimson-Marsh-Staunton (2002, 2010), and Ibbotson Associates (Morningstar) yearbooks.

To create long data histories for major asset classes, I sometimes splice best quality recent data and best available older data series. Most exhibits display total returns denominated in U.S. dollars; but some exhibits show real (inflation-adjusted) returns or excess returns over cash or over maturity/duration-matched Treasuries.

I especially thank Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton for the use of their 110-year-long return histories and Robert Arnott for even older data used in Arnott-Bernstein (2002). I am grateful to Michael Afreh (Nomura), Andrew Ang, David Blitz (Robeco), Giuliano de Rossi (UBS), Eric Falkenstein, Kenneth Froot, Robin Greenwood, Campbell Harvey, Sharon Kozicki, Carmen Reinhart, Matti Suominen, Arthur Warga, and Mungo Wilson for sending me some of their research data. I also thank Professors Kenneth French, Morris Davis, Amit Goyal, Lubos Pastor, Robert Shiller, Stephen Wilcox, and Jeffrey Wurgler for data available on their websites. Finally, a few graphs are directly extracted from other works, as credited below them: Figures 9.8 Rosenberg-Maurer, 17.4 Reinhart-Rogoff, 18.1 Hasbrouck, 18.2 Naes-Skjeltorp-Odegaard, 19.7 Buraschi-Kosowski-Trojani, 19.9 Frazzini-Pedersen, 27.6 Reinhart-Rogoff.

# B.1 ASSET CLASS AND SECTOR RETURNS

For global equity market returns, I use MSCI Barra monthly data for developed markets since 1970 and for emerging markets since 1988. For longer histories, I use Dimson-Marsh-Staunton (2002, 2010) annual returns dating back to 1900 for developed markets and to 1976 for emerging markets.

For U.S. equity returns (i.e., value-weighted market index; value, size, momentum, and other style portfolios; as well as industry portfolios) I use data from Kenneth French's website, dating back to 1926. This is also the source for global value style portfolios and the one-month Treasury bill rate. For certain analyses I use stock price, dividend yield, and earnings yield series since 1871 from Robert Shiller's website. For the longest histories (U.S. market returns back to 1802), I use Arnott-Bernstein (2002) data, which in turn is a composite of data from Professor G.W. Schwert (pre-1871 data), Ibbotson Associates, and First Quadrant; I extend 2000s' data using S&P 500 total returns. Some volatility and correlation analyses are based on S&P 500 daily returns.

For U.S. Treasury returns and yields, I combine data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) since 1952 and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (ML) Treasury index subsector data since 1978. (Since maturity subsectors differ somewhat between CRSP and ML, some interpolation is needed. Given the very high correlations between adjacent maturity Treasury returns, this should not distort the results.) I also use Ibbotson Associates' long (20-year) Treasury return and yield as well as the one-month Treasury bill rate since 1926. For earlier histories, I use data from Arnott-Bernstein (2002) and my own compilations. Data series before 1926 are almost always based on Homer-Sylla's (1991) yield histories, and often are based on high-grade municipal bond, corporate bond, or commercial paper series, given the absence of default-free Treasury yield histories. More recent daily yield histories are from Bloomberg.

For global government bond returns, I use Dimson-Marsh-Staunton (2002, 2010) data for currency-unhedged returns since 1900 and Citigroup (formerly Salomon Brothers) world government bond index data for currency-hedged returns since 1985.

For other fixed income returns and yields, the main source is Barclays Capital (BarCap, formerly Lehman Brothers) indices: investment-grade, Treasury, credit, and other sectors since the 1970s, as well as the high-yield index since the 1980s. These data are partly sourced via Bloomberg, partly via the Barclays Capital website. In early years only total returns and yield-to-worst measures are available (much of it based on Arthur Warga's pioneering research on early Lehman index data); they are linked to roughly maturity-matched Treasury subsectors to compute ex post excess returns and ex ante credit spreads. Since 1988-1989, I use better quality duration-adjusted excess returns and option-adjusted spreads (both over Treasuries). For certain rating/maturity subsector portfolios I use Citigroup and Merrill Lynch index data, but broad results are similar to BarCap/Lehman index data. Before Lehman indices became available, I use Ibbotson Associates' corporate bond returns (AAA/AA-rated long-dated bonds) for investment-grade bonds (since 1926). To proxy for high-yield bond returns from 1953 to the 1970s, I use a time series of low-quality (Baa and lower) bond returns that I got in grad school 20 years ago, which apparently was compiled by Roger Ibbotson in 1979 (no surprise!). For old corporate yields I use Moody's yields of seasoned, long-dated non-financial corporate bonds since 1919.

For emerging market debt, I use J.P. Morgan's "EMBI Global" index returns since 1994, extending the series to 1990-1993 by using Citigroup's Brady bond index data.

Sovereign CDS spreads are from Bloomberg.

For convertible bonds, I use Merrill Lynch's U.S. convertible bond index returns since the late-1980s.

For direct real estate in the U.S., my preferred index is the MIT-CRE "transactions-based" index since 1984 which uses NCREIF data but in a smarter way. The NCREIF index and its sector subsets date back to 1978. For listed real estate, I use the FTSE NAREIT composite index since 1972 and Global Property Research's global property stocks index (and its regional subsets) since 1984. For longer histories, I use the house price series compiled by Robert Shiller (annual data back to 1890 on his website), house price and rental yield data (back to 1960) collected by Davis-Lehnert-Martin (2008), data are located at Land and Property Values in the U.S. (Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, visit http://www.lincolninst.edu/resources/). (The latter series may not subtract lumpy capex-form net rents and thus may overstate investor returns.) In Chapter 3, I use estimates of 1960s' and 1970s' annual real estate returns from Dimson (2004):  $6.5\%$  and  $10.1\%$ , respectively.

For infrastructure, I use the UBS Global Infrastructure and Utilities (listed stock) index since 1990 as a proxy.

For timber, I use quarterly data since 1987 from the NCREF website.

For art price indices, I use Art Market Research data since 1976 and artprice.com data since 1990.

For commodity futures returns, I mainly use the S&P GSCI commodity index and its subsectors, dating back to the 1970s. For longer spot price histories I use oil price data from Knut Kjaer (1900), gold price data from Bloomberg (1920), and the Commodity Research Bureau's (CRB) index data (1957). In Chapter 3, I approximate 1960s' commodity returns by the sum of CRB spot index changes and Treasury bill returns. I also use self-collected total returns and roll return series for single-commodity futures.

For hedge fund returns (and funds of funds, and subsectors), I mainly use indices from Hedge Fund Research since 1990 but also compare it with indices from Dow Jones Credit Suisse since 1994.

For private equity and venture capital fund returns, I use Cambridge Associates' benchmark indices dating back to the 1980s. Quarterly indices are based on internal rates of returns. For listed private equity firms' performance I use the LPX 50 index since 1994.

# B.2 STRATEGY STYLE RETURNS

Value. Simulated long-short equity portfolio returns based on sorting stocks by the book/price (as well as cash flow/price, dividend/price, and earnings/price) ratios. Data are from Professor Kenneth French's website. Some analysis focuses on the U.S. book/price factor portfolio, called "value minus growth" (VMG) or "high minus low" (HML), others on a four-indicator composite. A global composite is the broadest value proxy I use, based on four U.S. indicators (since 1926, some start only in 1952) and four non-U.S. indicators (since 1975, extended with MSCI Barra data for 2008-2009). The ex post value outperformance and ex ante value spread in Figure 12.4 for raw and sector-neutral strategies since 1990 are from Giuliano De Rossi at UBS, who uses high-minus-low spreads after sorting U.S. Russell 3000 stocks each month into three tritiles.

Other equity trading style factors from Kenneth French's website include the size premium SMB (outperformance of small-cap vs. large-cap stocks), the momentum proxy MOM (outperformance of stocks with relatively high returns over the past year, excluding last month), short-term reversal STREV (outperformance of stocks with relatively low returns during the past month), and long-term reversal LTREV (outperformance of stocks with relatively low returns between 12 and 60 months ago). All of these style factors are based on long-short portfolios across a broad universe of U.S. stocks. Details on these factors as well as on style and industry portfolios are available on Kenneth French's website. I use the popular FF factors and sorted portfolio returns near the top of the page (visit http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ data_library.html). Professor French advised using these "research returns" instead of the "historical benchmark returns" near the bottom of the page, which are constructed in a somewhat different fashion.)

**Carry.** Simulated currency carry strategies are based on my own compilations using G10 spot exchange rates and one-month deposit rates (and extending back to other available money market rates in the 1970s). The base case strategy each week buys the top-three G10 currencies with the highest yields and sells the bottom-three with the lowest yields. The composite carry index also includes an emerging currency carry strategy, a fixed income carry strategy across G10 markets based on relative curve steepness, and a credit carry basket. Data are mainly from Bloomberg.

Trend. Simulated commodity momentum strategies are based on self-collected commodity futures return series since 1990 and earlier on the Mount Lucas Management Commodities trend index. This composite trend style index applies a simple trend-following rule each week on commodity futures, equity country futures, bond/rate futures, and foreign exchange forwards: go long (short) if the current price is above (below) the 12-month moving average. Data are mainly from Bloomberg.

Volatility. Volatility-selling returns are based on the simulated Merrill Lynch Equity Volatility Arbitrage Index since 1989, which tries to gain from the typically positive gap between market-implied volatility and subsequent realized volatility of the S&P 500 index's Bloomberg ticker MLHFEV1 index. Chapter 15 also analyzes the simulated covered-call-writing indices and put-writing indices (BXM, BXY, PUT in Bloomberg) on the S&P 500 index from the Chicago Board of Exchange, dating back to the 1980s. These indices are not delta neutral so their returns reflect market-directional exposures as much as volatility exposures.

Data on volatility-sorted stock portfolios are from Andrew Ang (Columbia University), David Blitz (Robeco), and Giuliano De Rossi (UBS).

Importantly, no trading costs have been subtracted from any of the strategy style returns.

# B.3 FACTOR PROXIES

Growth. Monthly change in the consensus forecast of U.S. real GDP growth over the next year, based on a survey by Consensus Economics.

Inflation. Monthly change in the consensus forecast of U.S. consumer price inflation rate over the next year, based on a survey by Consensus Economics.

Illiquidity. Monthly change in the Bank of England Liquidity Index, with sign flipped, and extended by proxy series in 1990-1991 and 2009 (Citi liquidity index). The Bank of England index is a composite based on several normalized liquidity-related series: bid-ask spreads in bond, FX and stock markets, return-to-volume ratios for individual stocks as well as for bond and stock markets, and yield spreads in corporate bond and money markets. Bank of England (2007) states: "The liquidity index shows the number of standard deviations from the mean. It is a simple unweighted average of nine liquidity measures, normalised on the period 1999-2004. The series shown is an exponentially weighted moving average. The indicator is more reliable after 1997 as it is based on a greater number of underlying measures."

Volatility. Monthly change in the VIX index of implied volatilities in S&P 500 equity index options.

# B.4 FORWARD-LOOKING YIELDS AND SPREADS

The main equity market yields I use are the smoothed real earnings yield (10-year average earnings divided by price, adjusted for inflation), standard trailing earnings yield, and dividend yield from Robert Shiller's website. The operating earnings yield is from Standard & Poor's website, the adjusted earnings yield in Wilcox (2007) is from Stephen Wilcox's website. Net buyback yields and M&A yields are from Nomura Securities.

Rental yields for U.S. housing are from Davis-Lehnert-Martin (2008); data are located at Land and Property Values in the U.S. (Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, visit http://www.lincolninst.edu/resources/). The cap rate series for U.S. commercial real estate is from the NCREF.

I have already described bond yield sources above under "Asset class and sector returns". In particular, the real yields in Figure 2.7 are Moody's long-dated Baa yield and Ibbotson Associates' 20-year Treasury yield minus the expected long-term inflation rate described below. Liquidity spreads in Figure 10.8 are from J.P. Morgan and Bloomberg. Ex ante value spreads for equity long-short value strategy in Figure 12.4 are from Giuliano De Rossi (UBS). Money market rates in Figure 3.12 and Table 3.5 are from Bloomberg and the St. Louis Fed website, while some yield curve analysis is based on data from the Federal Reserve Board website.

The ex ante equity premium is equity yield (measured by some variant of market earnings yield) and Treasury yield (long-dated or short-dated). The survey-based bond risk premium is the market yield (of the 10-year Treasury) minus the consensus forecast of short-term rates over the life of the bond. Credit spread is the difference between corporate bond yield and the somehow matching Treasury yield, preferably adjusted for embedded options. The break-even inflation rate (BEI) is the difference between nominal Treasury yield and a matching inflation-linked bond (TIPs) yield. The "net illiquidity premium vs. inflation premium" in Figure 17.9 is the difference between the survey-based long-term inflation forecast and the BEI.

# B.5 SURVEY DATA AND EXPECTED INFLATION

Consensus forecast returns on asset returns are from several survey sources: UBS Gallup poll, Duke University CFO survey, University of Michigan consumer confidence survey, Merrill Lynch fund manager poll, Survey of Professional Investors, and academic surveys by Ivo Welch and Pablo Fernandez. Analysts' earnings forecasts are from Credit Suisse. Economists' forecasts of future growth are from Blue Chip Economic Indicators.

Economists' forecasts of future U.S. inflation rates, to construct ex ante real yield series, are based on several survey sources (see below). Forecasts of inflation outside the U.S. are from Consensus Economics and private compilations.

Economists' forecasts of future Treasury bill rates, to construct survey-based bond risk premium series, are mainly based on Blue Chip Economic Indicators, but also

Goldsmith-Nagan (courtesy Kenneth Froot), Wall Street Journal, and Consensus Economics.

The expected long-term inflation series, which is displayed in Figure 17.5 and used in various places, is a spliced series and the most reasonable history I could come up with. Obviously, sources get better over time; distant histories can only be estimated statistically. I describe my series construction in some detail.

Actual survey data on long-term inflation start in 1978, with Hoey (private collection later passed to the Fed), the Livingston survey and the Survey of Professional Investors (both available at the Philly Fed website), *Blue Chip Economic Indicators*, and *Consensus Economics* who conduct surveys at different times. I take an average of two to three available surveys over the past 30 years.

Between 1955 and 1978 I use the statistical estimate of long-term inflation expectations by Kozicki-Tinsley (2006). Their "Survey-based estimates of the term structure of expected U.S. inflation" goes beyond an exponentially weighted average of past inflation rates because it also uses information in consensus forecasts of next year inflation. Short-term inflation forecasts in the Livingston survey date back to about 1950. (Fortunately, the contours of these statistical estimates nicely match those of available long-term consensus forecasts during the overlapping period after 1978.)

Before 1955 I use my own statistical estimates, combining two simple methodologies:

- One just takes a weighted average of past 10-year inflation rates, with gradually declining weights. Until the U.S. abandoned the gold standard in 1933 I average this time series estimate with zero (thereby anchoring the inflation forecast), based on the idea that during the gold standard inflations and deflations were equally likely to occur and not likely to become sustained.
- Another regresses next decade inflation on past decade inflation and uses the fitted value as the expected inflation estimate. Coefficients are re-estimated each year with new data using an expanding window that begins in 1871. This approach has very few independent observations; so I only start it in the 1930s.

Both approaches give broadly similar contours for inflation expectations. Later evidence suggests that survey expectations tend to be adaptive (reflecting past inflation experience, with declining weights). However, it seems reasonable that knowledge of the gold standard and experience of near-zero inflation over very long histories anchored expectations better at zero until the gold standard was abandoned.

# B.6 MISCELLANEOUS OTHER

The illiquidity estimates in Table 2.1, Figure 2.2, and Figure 18.4 are based on subjective assessments for each asset class on a scale from 1 to 5. When making these assessments I got some help from multi-asset-class experts at the giant Dutch pension fund asset manager APG.

Consumer price inflation (CPI) histories are from Bloomberg and Haver Analytics. Longer histories are from Robert Shiller's website and Arnott-Bernstein (2002). In Figure 3.10, Table 3.6, and Table 3.7 all asset returns are deflated using the CPI, except for ex ante 10-year real Treasury yield, which is based on expected long-term inflation.

Real GDP growth (and GDP-per-capita growth) series are from Bloomberg and

Haver Analytics. Longest histories—U.S. data going back to 1802—are from Arnott-Bernstein (2002).

Most stock market predictors in Table 8.6 are sourced from the Haver Analytics, Amit Goyal, and Robert Shiller websites, as well as from Mungo Wilson. Bond market predictors in Tables 9.3 and 10.4 are from Cochrane-Piazzesi (bond risk premium), Kim-Wright (bond risk premium), Greenwood-Vayanos (debt maturity share), the Chicago Fed (CFNAI or Chicago Fed National Activity Index), Consensus Economics (expected fiscal balance), Bloomberg (VIX and MOVE implied volatility indices for stocks and Treasuries), and other macro-data from Haver Analytics.

The default rates in Chapter 10 are from Moody's (2010).
