**Formatting Changes:**
1.  **Table of Contents:**
    - Converted `<toc>` block to nested bulleted list.
    - Removed page numbers (e.g., "3", "24" at ends of lines).
    - Removed blank lines between items.
    - Added indentation for Chapters and Sections.

2.  **Typos & Artifacts:**
    - Fixed split words (e.g., ` - f ` -> ` of `, ` - n ` -> ` on `, ` - ut ` -> ` out `).
    - Removed strikethrough artifacts (`~~.~~`, `~~:~~`, etc.).
    - Preserved text where `~~` wrapped content (e.g., `~~T~~ he` -> `The`).

3.  **Math & Currency:**
    - Escaped `$` used for currency (e.g., `$10 million` -> `\$10 million`).
    - Escaped `%` (e.g., `10%` -> `10\%`).
    - Preserved LaTeX math blocks (inline `$...$` and block `$$...$$`).
    - Heuristically distinguished between Currency and Math based on content (e.g., presence of `\`, `/`, `=`, `_` vs digits).
