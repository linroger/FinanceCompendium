# Tag Classification Guide: Primary vs Secondary Tags

## Purpose
This guide establishes clear criteria for distinguishing between primary_tags and secondary_tags in Obsidian markdown documents to ensure consistent tagging across the FinanceCompendium.

## Primary Tags: Core Identity Categories

### Definition
Primary tags represent the fundamental subject matter that defines what the document IS about. These are the essential, non-negotiable topics that would appear in the title or main heading of the document.

### Criteria
- **Essentiality**: Without these concepts, the document would lose its core identity
- **Universality**: These appear throughout the document as central themes
- **Search Frequency**: Likely to be searched by users looking for this specific topic
- **Uniqueness**: Distinctive to the document's primary purpose

### Examples
- For a derivatives pricing document: `options pricing`, `black-scholes model`, `greeks`
- For a fixed income document: `bond valuation`, `duration and convexity`, `yield curve`
- For an equity document: `equity valuation`, `discounted cash flow`, `market multiples`

### Quantity
- 3-5 tags for most documents
- Maximum of 8 for very comprehensive documents

## Secondary Tags: Supporting Context Categories

### Definition
Secondary tags represent related concepts, methodologies, applications, and contextual information that support the primary topics but are not the core focus.

### Criteria
- **Supporting Role**: These enhance understanding but are not the main focus
- **Specificity**: Often more detailed or specialized than primary tags
- **Application Context**: Specific use cases, industries, or scenarios
- **Methodological Details**: Specific techniques, variations, or implementations

### Examples
- For a derivatives document: `implied volatility`, `volatility surface`, `american options`, `exotic options`
- For a fixed income document: `treasury bonds`, `corporate bonds`, `mortgage-backed securities`, `credit risk`
- For an equity document: `growth stocks`, `value investing`, `sector rotation`, `momentum investing`

### Quantity
- 8-15 tags for most documents
- Maximum of 25 for comprehensive documents

## Distinction Between Primary and Secondary Tags

### Primary Tags Are:
- **Broad and Fundamental**: Core concepts that define the field/subject
- **Title Reflective**: Directly related to the document title
- **Search Driven**: What users would search for first
- **Category Defining**: Place the document in its main category

### Secondary Tags Are:
- **Specific and Detailed**: More granular aspects of the subject
- **Content Derived**: Topics covered within but not defining the document
- **Cross-Reference Enabling**: Connect to related concepts elsewhere
- **Context Providing**: Additional descriptors that enhance discovery

## Selection Rules

### For Primary Tags:
1. **Must Appear in Title or Main Heading**: If it's in the title, it's likely a primary tag
2. **Core Concept Test**: If removing this concept makes the document lose its identity
3. **Frequency Test**: Appears consistently throughout the document
4. **User Intent Match**: What would users expect to find in a document with this title
5. **Hierarchical Position**: Higher-level, more general concepts

### For Secondary Tags:
1. **Supporting Material**: Topics covered but not central to the document
2. **Specific Applications**: Particular use cases or implementations
3. **Method Variants**: Specific techniques or approaches mentioned
4. **Contextual Elements**: Industry, geography, time period, audience
5. **Cross-Linking Potential**: Connect to other documents in the vault

## Tag Format Standards

### Naming Convention:
- Use lowercase words
- Separate multiple words with spaces: `interest rate modeling`
- Avoid underscores or hyphens unless they're part of standard terminology
- Use natural language rather than abbreviations (unless the abbreviation is more common)

### Granularity:
- Primary tags: Higher-level, more general concepts
- Secondary tags: More specific, detailed concepts
- Avoid redundancy between primary and secondary tags
- Ensure tags are specific enough to be meaningful but general enough to be useful

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing tags, verify:
1. **Completeness**: Do the primary tags fully capture the document's core identity?
2. **Specificity**: Do secondary tags add meaningful context without being too narrow?
3. **Balance**: Is there a good balance between broad and specific tags?
4. **Searchability**: Would users likely search for these terms?
5. **Consistency**: Are similar documents tagged similarly?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Making primary tags too specific or secondary tags too general
- Duplicating concepts across primary and secondary tags
- Including overly narrow or obscure terms in primary tags
- Missing fundamental concepts that should be primary tags
- Creating tags that are too similar to each other
- Using inconsistent terminology across documents
